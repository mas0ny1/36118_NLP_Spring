scene_heading: HANNAH AND HER SISTERS
dialog: by
dialog: Woody Allen
text: As the last credit appears, the song ends in a crescendo and
text: the screen fades to total black.
text: Immediately, a new melody begins, an uptempo jazz number, as
text: a title appears on the screen.
dialog: "God, she's beautiful..."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A full face of Lee, wearing a gray sweater and leaning
text: against the dining room doorway. She gazes into the camera
text: with a half-smile on her face as Elliot speaks over the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: God, she's beautiful.
text: Lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway
text: and walks away. The camera follows her, moving across a
text: book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from
text: view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule.
text: People, some holding drinks, some just entering the
text: apartment, surround her. Everyone is talking at once,
text: carrying on easy, familiar conversation.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: She's got the prettiest eyes, and
text: she looks so sexy in that sweater.
text: Lee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Hi, how are you?
text: Two more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full
text: now. Still walking, Lee lightly hugs one of the children as
text: she continues on her way towards the living room. Elliot's
text: voice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: I just want to be alone with her
dialog: and hold her and kiss her...
text: Lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a
text: moment to talk to the child she has just hugged.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: ...and tell her how much I love her
dialog: and take care of her. Stop it, you
dialog: idiot. She's your wife's sister.
dialog: But I can't help it.
text: The camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops
text: to chat with her mother. Elliot's voice, as well as the
text: music, continues over the low din of warm conversation.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: I'm consumed by her. It's been
dialog: months now. I dream about her. I-
dialog: I, I think about her at the office.
dialog: Oh, Lee.
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: What am I gonna do?
text: Lee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation
text: with her mother. She passes several other guests, then
text: turns to greet April, giving her a warm, brief hug.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: I hear myself mooning over you, and
dialog: it's disgusting. Before, when she...
text: Elliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen,
text: standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing,
text: rotund man. Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray
text: of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them. The
text: space is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make
dialog: room for her.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
text: ...squeezed past me in the doorway,
dialog: and I smelled that perfume on the
text: back of her neck...
text: Elliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious,
text: continues to talk. Elliot reluctantly returns to the
text: conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at
text: the offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: ...Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna
dialog: swoon! Easy...
text: The camera resumes following a smiling Lee. She has just
text: put down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and
text: obliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still
text: ruminating, watches her, entranced.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: You're a dignified financial
dialog: advisor. It doesn't look good for
dialog: you to swoon.
text: The camera stays with Elliot, who is still watching the
text: offscreen Lee. In the background, guests continue to
text: chatter warmly with each other.
text: Hannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind
text: the distracted Elliot.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (nibbling on an hors d'oeuvre)
dialog: Elliot? Elliot?
dialog: (rubbing his shoulder)
dialog: Sweetheart?
text: Elliot returns from his reveries with a start.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (turning to Hannah)
dialog: Mm-hm?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (pointing to the tray)
dialog: Have you tried these? These are
dialog: wonderful.
dialog: (nibbling, swallowing)
dialog: Holly and her friend made them.
text: Elliot, taking one of the hors d'oeuvres, starts nibbling as
text: well as he and Hannah walk past the bookshelf into the
dialog: living room.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (swallowing)
dialog: They're fantastic.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping, still eating)
dialog: Aren't they great?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (swallowing)
dialog: I know! I know!
text: Elliot and Hannah, eating and talking, walk past a hallway
text: and offscreen as Holly appears, walking down the hallway.
text: She holds a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres; she stands
text: at the entrance to the hallway, eating and looking at the
text: offscreen guests.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (walking offscreen)
dialog: She has all the cooking talent.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (walking offscreen swallowing)
dialog: No, she doesn't, either. You've
dialog: got tons as well.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
text: Holly, standing in the hallway onscreen, swallows loudly.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen,
dialog: overlapping Holly)
dialog: Holly, why don't you open your own
dialog: restaurant?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (turning to the
dialog: offscreen Elliot and
text: Hannah, trying to swallow)
dialog: Mmm, we practically are. Well...
dialog: (holding her hand to
dialog: her mouth)
dialog: not a restaurant, but...
dialog: (swallowing)
dialog: April and I are going to do some
dialog: catering!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: What? You're kidding!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: No, no, we decided!
text: Holly takes a sip of her drink as Hannah and Elliot walk
text: over to her.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Perfect!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding and swallowing)
dialog: Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for
dialog: our friends, so
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: we thought until an acting job
dialog: comes through, we could just make
dialog: some extra money, you know, doing a
dialog: few private parties.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Great idea.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (overlapping Hannah)
dialog: That's where your talent lies.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (swallowing and nodding)
dialog: I know.
text: Holly and Hannah begin to laugh.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing to Elliot,
dialog: still laughing)
dialog: Get outta here.
dialog: (to Hannah)
dialog: Could I speak to you privately?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Oh, sure.
text: Holly and Hannah walk off; Elliot watches them leave.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (calling after them
text: as he nibbles on an
dialog: hors d'oeuvre)
dialog: I'm her husband! She tells me
dialog: anything!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past a memo-cluttered
text: refrigerator to the stove as Holly, behind her, begins to
text: speak. The faint sounds of music are still heard.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Hannah, I have to borrow some more
dialog: money.
dialog: (sipping her drink)
dialog: Don't get upset.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (stirring some food
text: in a saucepan on the stove)
dialog: Mmm, I never get upset over that.
dialog: Mmm?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: This is the last time, I promise.
dialog: And I'm keeping strict accounts.
text: As Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah busily works in
text: the kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked
text: with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and
text: general party clutter. She walks on-and-offscreen as she
text: talks and listens to her sister.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Holly, please. Don't insult me.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (putting her empty
text: glass and plate down
dialog: on the table)
dialog: Someday, I'll pay it all back.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I know. H-how much do you need?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Two thousand dollars.
text: Hannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby
text: counter, hesitates momentarily. She turns to Holly.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: (trying to nod her
dialog: head casually)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (gesturing, her back
dialog: to the camera)
dialog: Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my
dialog: friend April and I, we have this
dialog: catering idea I think's going to be
dialog: great.
text: Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past Holly.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (turning to face Hannah)
dialog: You admit that we're great cooks,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (nodding, back at the
dialog: stove now, stirring
dialog: in a pot)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (putting her hands in
dialog: her pockets)
dialog: Well, in order to get started,
dialog: there's just a few things I have to
dialog: buy...
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: and some old debts I have
dialog: outstanding.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (looking at her sister)
dialog: Will you just tell me one thing?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Are we talking about cocaine again?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (shaking her head no)
dialog: I swear. I swear. We've already
dialog: got some requests to do a few
dialog: dinner parties.
text: A timer goes off. Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some
text: food on a different stove. Holly turns to face her. Only
text: Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, the
text: camera moving in closer on her face. As Holly speaks, she
text: distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre. In the background,
text: her parents can be heard singing in the living room.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I mean, obviously, I'm not going to
dialog: be a caterer forever, you know. We
text: both still go to auditions.
dialog: Something could turn up at any
dialog: moment. But the parties are at
dialog: night, days are free, I can still
dialog: take my acting class. I haven't
dialog: done drugs on a year.
text: Holly pops another hors d'oeuvre into her mouth as the
text: background singing gets louder and the film cuts to:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The living room is crowded with family and guests sitting
text: comfortably on chairs near the piano, where Evan, Hannah's
text: father, plays "Bewitched" as Hannah's mother, Norma, sits
text: nearby, accompanying him in their duet. A child is sprawled
text: out under a blanket on a sofa; some guests chatter quietly;
text: others drink and eat, listening.
speaker_heading: EVAN &amp; NORMA
dialog: (singing)
text: "A whimpering, simpering
dialog: Child again
text: Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered
dialog: Am I..."
text: As they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen,
text: where Lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: Mom and Dad are floating down
dialog: memory lane again!
text: Lee walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a
text: counter. Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe.
text: Holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink. The music from
text: the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat
text: comfortably and easily with each other.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: (smiling and turning
dialog: to Lee)
dialog: Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly
dialog: and her friend's shrimp puffs?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding to Holly,
dialog: touching her arm)
dialog: I think they're fantastic.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (to Holly)
dialog: You've outdone yourself.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping her
text: sisters, shrugging
dialog: and smiling)
dialog: Oh, my God. Thank you.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (interrupting, to Hannah)
dialog: I need an antihistamine. Mom
text: thinks she's feeling her asthma,
dialog: and so...
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Ohh?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, lighting
dialog: a cigarette)
dialog: Uh-oh.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (continuing)
text: ...before she starts turning into
dialog: Camille...
dialog: (laughing)
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets
text: up in the morning.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (turning to Holly)
dialog: At least she isn't drinking. Did
dialog: you notice?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Mm-hm.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: (turning to look at
text: her sisters, laughing)
dialog: Doesn't she look great in that new
dialog: dress?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah.
text: The sisters all talk at once; Hannah is still working at the
dialog: sink.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Don't you think she does?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: She really does, though.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (turning towards the sink)
dialog: Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause
text: she's flirting with all the men here.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (puffing on her cigarette)
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (scooping out some
dialog: cantaloupe seeds)
dialog: Maybe when she's eighty, she'll
text: stop straightening her garter belt
dialog: when there's a guy around.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (to Lee, laughing)
dialog: I should get a garter belt.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (looking down at herself)
dialog: Get a garter belt...
dialog: (sipping her drink)
dialog: Get a garter belt and flirt.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (laughing, to Hannah)
dialog: Where are the antihistamines?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that.
dialog: Uh, he's got them somewhere.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Okay.
text: Lee leaves the kitchen. Holly, puffing on her cigarette,
text: watches her go.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (sighing)
text: Frederick didn't come with her.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (turning to Holly,
dialog: still working at the sink)
dialog: When does Frederick ever come with
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (whispering intently)
dialog: Tch. He's such an angry...he's
dialog: such a depressive. I thought she
dialog: was moving out!
text: Hannah shakes her head in disapproval while Holly angrily
text: takes another sip of her drink.
text: And the film cuts briefly back to the living room, where
text: Evan is still playing the piano and singing. The camera
text: moves past him and a few guests to Norma, who is
text: enthusiastically singing along, looking at Evan and moving
text: her hands.
speaker_heading: EVAN &amp; NORMA
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "A pill he is
dialog: But still he is
dialog: All mine and I'll
dialog: Keep him until he is
dialog: Bewitched, a'both--"
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The table is beautifully set for Thanksgiving dinner,
text: complete with candles, flowers, cut crystal, china, and
text: silver. Hannah's children are playing in the room as Hannah
text: enters, carrying a huge roast turkey. Behind her is Holly,
text: carrying a casserole. Hannah's parents can still be heard
text: singing in the background.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (to the children)
dialog: Watch out, you guys. Beep-beep!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Oh, your kids are so adorable.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN
dialog: (walking through the doorway)
dialog: Bye! Bye!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (putting down her
dialog: bowl on the table)
dialog: God, it gets so lonely on the
dialog: holidays.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (setting down the
text: turkey on the opposite
dialog: end of the table)
dialog: Oh, gosh. Well, you know, that's
dialog: why I invited Phil Gammage tonight.
text: As the sisters talk, the piano music stops. There's the
text: sound of light applause as Evan begins a new song, faintly
text: heard in the dining room.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (grimacing, reacting
dialog: to Hannah)
dialog: Oh, Hannah!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: It's, uh, you never know--
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (interrupting, gesturing)
dialog: He's such a loser!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: He's not a loser at all!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Oh, he's such a loser!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping, lighting
text: a set of candles on
dialog: the table)
dialog: He's the headmaster of Daisy's
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh, perfect! He reminds me of
dialog: Ichabod Crane.
dialog: (moving her hand up
dialog: and down her throat)
text: His Adam's apple keeps jumping up
text: and down whenever he gets excited.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Listen. He's a lot better than
dialog: your ex-husband. He's got a good
dialog: job.
dialog: (handing a pack of
dialog: matches to Holly)
dialog: Would you light those, please?
dialog: He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (striking a match to
dialog: light another set of candles)
dialog: Give me a break.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Am I interrupting...
text: The film cuts to April, standing in the doorway of the
text: dining room and holding a drink.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...any sister talk?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Mm-mm!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Come in.
text: The camera moves with April as she walks over to the table,
text: where Hannah and Holly are lighting candles.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Oh, good...
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping, still offscreen)
dialog: Come in, come in.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: ...because there are no interesting
dialog: single men at this party!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (now onscreen)
dialog: Oh, listen...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (interrupting, waving
dialog: out her match)
dialog: I know. It's terrible!
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: I mean, I've looked everywhere.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (picking at the
dialog: turkey and gesturing)
dialog: Maybe April would like Phil. Phil
text: Gammage, the tall guy in there by
text: the piano.
text: Holly groans, looking at her sister, while April sips her
text: drink and nods.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (pointing to herself)
dialog: Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: (looking at April, nodding)
dialog: Mmm?
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: He's the--He looks like Ichabod
dialog: Crane?
text: Hannah screams with laughter as she walks toward the end of
text: the table, past a gleeful Holly, who points her finger at
text: Hannah as she passes. Hannah, still laughing, playfully
text: pushes the accusing finger away.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (laughing with the
dialog: sisters, gesturing)
dialog: I love that. That's my type.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: (shaking her head, laughing)
dialog: I can't believe it!
text: She walks over to a nearby china cabinet.
speaker_heading: APRIL
text: (nodding and looking
dialog: at Hannah)
dialog: No, really, I really like him a lot.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, laughing
dialog: and gesturing)
dialog: No, really, we mustn't get
dialog: discouraged.
text: As Holly continues to tease her sister, Hannah opens a
text: drawer in the cabinet. She takes out two apples decorated
text: with paper turkey heads and tails and hands them to April.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (fussing at the table)
dialog: Hannah will invite some men over
dialog: who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Mmm.
text: April starts to put the turkey apples on the table. A
text: bemused Hannah takes two more out of the cabinet and places
text: one of them on the table as well.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (straightening a
dialog: table setting)
dialog: Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping, to
dialog: April, who has just
dialog: set down her apples)
dialog: Here. Be careful with those.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (continuing her
dialog: teasing, gesturing)
dialog: Maybe at Christmas, New Year's. If
dialog: not this New Year's, maybe next New
dialog: Year's.
text: While Holly is talking, Hannah hands her the last turkey
text: apple, accidentally sticking her with one of the toothpicks
text: that keeps the decorations in place.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Ouch!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (turning to her
dialog: sister in surprise)
dialog: Oh!
text: The film cuts to a short hallway leading to a bathroom in
text: Hannah's apartment. In the foreground is a standing lamp.
text: In the background, Elliot is seen walking inside the
text: bathroom, looking around the room. Light piano music is
text: dimly heard.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (searching)
dialog: Must be here someplace.
text: He walks out of the bathroom, moving down the hallway
text: towards the camera.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, you know, I, I love that book
dialog: you lent me. The Easter Parade?
dialog: You were right. It had very
dialog: special meaning for me.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
text: How's Frederick? He didn't come.
text: Elliot walks into the bedroom as Lee continues to talk
text: offscreen. The camera, leaving Elliot, moves across the
text: room, past a wall of framed paintings, a headboard and bed,
text: a night table and lamp, revealing Lee. She is flipping
text: through a book by a curtained window.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, well, you know Frederick. One
dialog: of his moods. Although it wasn't a
dialog: bad week. He
dialog: (onscreen)
dialog: uh, sold a picture.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, great.
text: The camera stays with Lee as she walks around the room, past
text: another curtained window, a television set, and a rolltop
text: desk. She absently flips through the book as she talks to
text: the offscreen Elliot.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yeah, it was, it was one of his
dialog: better drawings, a very beautiful
dialog: nude study. Actually, it was of me.
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: It's funny, you know, it's a funny
dialog: feeling to know you're being hung
text: naked in some stranger's living room.
text: Lee puts the book she's been holding down on the desk, only
text: to pick up another one. She looks at the offscreen Elliot.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Well, you can't tell it's me,
dialog: although--
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: You're turning all red, Elliot.
text: She reacts. The camera moves to a blushing Elliot, following
text: him now as he walks across the room.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (laughing self-consciously)
dialog: Really? So, so, what else? Wh-
dialog: what are you up to?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, I don't know. My unemployment
dialog: checks are running out. Um, I was
dialog: thinking of taking some courses at
dialog: Columbia with the last of my savings.
text: As Lee speaks, Elliot parts a hanging curtain against the
text: wall to reveal a stereo and some records. He looks at the
dialog: offscreen Lee.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Like, uh...?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I don't know exactly.
text: As Elliot reaches inside the stereo shelf, grabbing a bottle
text: of antihistamines, the camera moves back to Lee, who sits
text: down on the bed. She is still holding a book.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Uh, sociology, psychology maybe. I
dialog: always thought I might like to work
dialog: with children.
text: Elliot walks over to Lee; he sits down on a footstool in
text: front of her.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing with the
dialog: bottle of pills
text: gripped in his hand)
dialog: Incidentally, I-I always have
text: clients who are furnishing places.
dialog: Some of them might-might be
dialog: interested in buying art. Shall I,
dialog: shall I call you?
dialog: (chuckling self-consciously)
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yeah, sure.
dialog: (taking the bottle of
dialog: pills Elliot hands her)
dialog: You know, uh, Frederick would
dialog: really by grateful for a sale.
text: She chuckles; Elliot smiles and chuckles with her.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Hey, you guys?
text: Elliot turns in the direction of his wife's voice.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Dinner's ready.
text: Hannah, eating a carrot stick, enters the bedroom. The
text: camera stays with her momentarily as she walks towards
dialog: Elliot and Lee.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, great.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: You look so beautiful.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (standing by Elliot
dialog: and Lee)
dialog: Doesn't she look pretty?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I bumped into your...
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (overlapping, agreeing
dialog: with Hannah)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...ex-husband on the street the
dialog: other day.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (biting her carrot)
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: He was, he's just as crazy as ever.
text: He was on his way to get a blood
dialog: test.
dialog: (laughing, Elliot
dialog: joining in)

dialog: (reacting)
dialog: God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac.
dialog: I wonder how he'd handle it if
dialog: there was ever anything really
dialog: wrong with him?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: Let's go have dinner, shall we?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Mmm.
speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Everyone is seated around the table for Thanksgiving dinner.
text: Facing the camera are Holly, Lee, Norma, and Hannah. She
text: sits to the left of Elliot, who's at the head of the table.
text: On his right is Evan; April sits next to him. She and the
text: other guests sit with their backs to the screen. The table
text: overflows with food, floral decorations, and candles. In
text: the background, the children sit at a separate table; a maid
text: serves them turkey. The guests chatter comfortably among
text: themselves as they eat.
speaker_heading: EVAN
text: (clanking a piece of
dialog: silverware against
dialog: his water glass)
dialog: Now, ladies and gentlemen...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (making a face)
dialog: Dad.
text: Evan continues to clank his glass to get everyone's attention.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Dad...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (reacting, to Holly)
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (still clanking)
dialog: No, now...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I'm starving!
text: Resigned, Holly puts down her silverware. Lee smothers a
text: laugh. Norma, reacting, glances at Holly and Lee. Everyone
dialog: knows what's coming.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (clanking away)
dialog: ...this is a toast! This is a toast.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (reaching across the
dialog: table for Evan's wine
dialog: glass, laughing)
dialog: Get his wine away.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: This is a toast. You know this
dialog: beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was
dialog: all...
text: Holly laughs. Lee glances over to her, reacting. Hannah,
text: embarrassed, reacts and sits with her hands on her face.
text: Lee and the rest of the guests put down their silverware.
text: They look at Evan, listening.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: ...prepared...by Hannah.
text: Hannah, embarrassed, makes a victory sign.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (modestly pointing to
dialog: the maid)
dialog: Uh, and a little help...
text: Lee and Holly try to suppress their laughter. Norma glares
text: at them.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (to her daughters)
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...from Mavis, also.
text: Elliot wraps his arm around Hannah; he pulls her towards him
text: affectionately and kisses her on the cheek. She hugs him
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (hugging Hannah)
dialog: You bet.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping, looking
text: down the table while
text: still in Elliot's embrace)
text: Holly and April, thanks for helping.
text: Mavis the maid exits, carrying some trays, as the group
text: starts to cheer and applaud. Holly waves her napkin at
text: April, then holds up her wine glass.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (overlapping the noise)
dialog: No, you did it.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, toasting
dialog: her friend)
dialog: April, April!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
dialog: I am... I did slave all day.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (overlapping, holding
dialog: out his wine glass)
dialog: And we drink to her, and we all
text: congratulate her on her wonderful
dialog: accomplishment during this last
dialog: year...her great success in A
dialog: Doll's House!
text: The group continues to cheer as they all toast Hannah. She
text: reacts, smiling but embarrassed.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (overlapping, laughing)
dialog: Ya-a-a-a-y!
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I played Nora. I hate to tell you
dialog: what year...
text: The guests, sipping their wine, quiet down as Norma continues
text: to speak. Lee and Holly unsuccessfully try to contain their
text: laughter. Mavis reenters the dining room to serve more food
dialog: to the children.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And it's very difficult to behave
text: like Torvald's little chipmunk
dialog: without making a perfect ass out of
dialog: yourself!
dialog: (pausing while the
dialog: guests laugh heartily)
dialog: Now I think that Ibsen would have
dialog: been damn proud of our Hannah!
text: Norma toasts her daughter; everyone follows her. The
text: applause and cheers begin anew. Hannah, reacting, chuckles.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (overlapping the
text: applause and clapping loudly)
dialog: Speech! Speech! Speech!
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Yea-a-a-a-ah!
text: A few guests sip their wine. They all quiet down as Hannah
text: starts her speech, glancing around the table and gesturing.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: I don't know about that. Oh, no, I
dialog: just, see, I-I've been very, very
dialog: lucky. W-when I had the kids, I
dialog: decided to stop working and just,
dialog: you know, devote myself to having
dialog: the family, and I've been very,
dialog: very happy
text: (banging her fists
dialog: lightly on the table)
dialog: but...I've always secretly hoped
dialog: that maybe some little gem would
dialog: come along and tempt me back on the
dialog: stage...
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ...just for a second. So, now I
dialog: got that out of my system and I can
dialog: go back to the thing that makes me
dialog: happiest.
text: Hannah tenderly takes Elliot's hand as she looks around the
text: table. He, in turn, kneads her shoulder, chuckling with
dialog: equal tenderness.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Oh, bravo! Bravo!
text: Hannah, still embarrassed, looks down at a plate. The group
text: applauds once more, toasting and drinking, and warmly
text: sounding their approval.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: "We all had a terrific time."
text: Classical string music plays as the film cuts to:
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT
text: A taxi moves down Broadway towards the camera, passing a
text: truck on the right, the Winter Garden marquee advertising
text: Cats, and several buildings, and as the taxi moves offscreen,
text: the classical music still playing, the movie cuts to the
text: taxi's backseat. Lee sits by the window, leaning her head
text: in her hand, a reflective look on her face. Her voice is
text: heard over the screen.
speaker_heading: LEE (V.O.)
dialog: Is it my imagination, or does
dialog: Elliot have a little crush on me?
dialog: (chuckling slightly)
dialog: It's funny. I've had that thought
dialog: before. He pays a lot of attention
dialog: to me all the time, and he blushed
dialog: tonight when we were alone in the
dialog: bedroom. I wonder if he and Hannah
dialog: are happy? It's funny, I...I still
text: feel a little buzz from his flirting.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FREDERICK'S LOFT - NIGHT
text: Lee stirs a cup of coffee on the counter of the loft's
text: modern kitchen area; a nearby vase hold flowers. She walks
text: across the loft, with its high ceilings and beige walls,
text: holding her coffee.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (to an offscreen Frederick)
dialog: Want some coffee or tea?
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: No, thank you.
text: Lee continues to walk, past a modern chaise, a bookcase,
text: some sofas, two columns. Lamps hang down from the ceiling.
text: The classical music still plays in the background. Lee
text: stops at a plastic-enclosed work area. Frederick can be
text: seen working at a drawing board on the other side of the
text: clear plastic screen.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (stirring her coffee)
dialog: How about something to eat?
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: No, nothing.
text: The background music stops.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (walking around the
dialog: screen to Frederick)
dialog: Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
dialog: (laughing)
text: As Lee walks over to the drawing board where Frederick is
text: sitting, he is seen intently cleaning some paintbrushes with
text: a rag. Lee stands by him, leaning over the board, and looks
text: directly at him. The table is filled with cans of brushes
text: and artist's equipment.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: God!
dialog: (sniffing)
dialog: And why didn't you come tonight?
dialog: We all had a terrific time. I
dialog: really think you would have enjoyed
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (not looking at Lee)
dialog: I'm going through a period of my
dialog: life where I just can't be around
dialog: people.
dialog: (putting down the
dialog: brushes and wiping
text: his hands with the
dialog: same rag)
dialog: I didn't want to wind up abusing
dialog: anyone.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You're not going to abuse them.
dialog: They're all so sweet.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (taking off his glasses)
dialog: Lee...
dialog: (pausing, reaching
dialog: for Lee's hand)
dialog: you are the only person I can be
dialog: with...who I really look forward to
dialog: being with.
dialog: (pulling Lee to him,
dialog: around the board)
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (compliantly)
dialog: You're too harsh with everyone.
dialog: You know that, don't you?
text: Frederick and Lee embrace; Lee sighs.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (looking into Lee's eyes)
dialog: Isn't it enough that I can love you?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Mmm...
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ...you're such a puzzle.
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: So sweet with me and
dialog: so...contemptuous of everyone else.
dialog: (sighing)
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (sniffing)
dialog: Well, there was a time
dialog: (sniffing again)
dialog: when you were very happy to be only
dialog: with me. You wanted to learn
dialog: everything about poetry, about music.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Mm-hm.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: Have I really taught you everything
dialog: I have to give?
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: I don't think so.
text: Lee kisses Frederick twice, then releases him and walks out
dialog: of the work area.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (turning her head in
dialog: Frederick's direction)
dialog: Oh, Elliot said he might have a
dialog: couple of clients for you.
text: Lee walks over to the loft's stereo area, pulling up the
text: sleeves of her sweater as Frederick talks.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I'm sure all those morons he
dialog: handles have a deep feeling for art.
text: Lee picks up a book from the stereo shelf. She leans back
text: against the unit, glancing through its pages.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (flipping through the book)
speaker_heading: Mmm
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: you never know. They might. He's
dialog: just trying to do the nice thing.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Because he likes you.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (looking up from the book)
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: Yeah.
text: Frederick, leaving his work area, walks past Lee; his hands
text: are in his pockets.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
text: (looking at Lee as he
dialog: goes by)
dialog: Elliot lusts after you.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Based on what? You never even see
dialog: him.
text: The camera stays with Frederick as he walks into the loft's
dialog: bedroom area.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: Based on...whenever you see him,
dialog: you always come home full of books
dialog: he's recommended...
text: He sits down at the foot of the bed and starts taking off
text: his shoes.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...or films you must see or...
dialog: (shrugging)
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (walking over to him)
dialog: Oh, no, no, no. He's my sister's
dialog: husband. And I think if you gave
dialog: him half a chance, you'd like him.
dialog: He's very intelligent.
text: Lee sits down next to Frederick; he takes her hand.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: He's a glorified accountant, and
dialog: he's after you.
dialog: (kissing Lee's hand)
dialog: And I prefer to sell my work to
dialog: people who appreciate it, not to
dialog: rock stars.
dialog: (kissing Lee's face)
dialog: You understand?
text: Lee kisses Frederick back on the cheek. They embrace.
text: Frederick laughs; their embrace gets tighter.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Ohhh!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: The hypochondriac.
text: Upbeat jazz plays in the background and continues as the
dialog: film cuts to:
scene_heading: INT. TV STUDIO CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Metal elevator doors open and Mickey Sachs, a high-powered
text: television producer, walks out, deep in conversation with
text: his assistants, Paul and Larry. As the elevator operator
text: begins to reclose the door with his passengers, Mickey, his
text: assistants fast behind, walks down an office corridor past
text: busy groups of studio personnel. Indistinct conversation,
text: as well as the jazz, is heard in the background as the trio
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: What do you mean, they won't let us
dialog: do the sketch?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Talk to Standards and Practices.
dialog: They think it's too dirty.
text: The trio pass Mary, another assistant, in conversation with
text: two other co-workers. She holds a clipboard.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: But we showed it to them in
dialog: rehearsal!
text: Without missing a beat, he takes Mary's wrist and continues
dialog: walking.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (to Paul)
dialog: You know, what'd they do, figure
dialog: out what the words mean?
text: A foursome now, they briskly walk past a man and a woman
text: going over a script. Mary and Mickey lead; Paul and Larry
dialog: follow.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Mickey, we got a half hour to air!
text: As the group walks through a large doorway, Larry catches up
dialog: to Mickey.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: We're short! The show is five
dialog: minutes short!
text: The group turns right into a new corridor, briefly off the
text: screen. As they scurry off, their voices are heard.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: How could it be short? We timed
dialog: everything
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: If we have to...
text: They are all now seen walking down the new corridor towards
text: the camera. The corridor is crowded with busy TV personnel.
text: The group continues to talk frantically as people hurry past
text: them. One man pushes rudely past Mary as he walks; she
text: looks back at him briefly.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...pull out the sketch, then we'll
dialog: be ten minutes short!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I don't know how they can do that
dialog: to us. That's-- We go on in thirty
dialog: minutes, right?
text: Mary checks her wristwatch as they rush down the corridor.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (squeezing past
dialog: several passersby)
dialog: They're doing it because our
dialog: ratings are low.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (nervously rubbing
dialog: his forehead)
dialog: I got such a migraine.
text: As the group briskly walks past an open door, Gail, another
text: assistant, runs out, brandishing her glasses.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Hey, Mickey!
text: Gail runs in front of the group. Without missing a step,
text: she faces Mickey and walks backwards, gesturing and talking
dialog: frantically.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: Mickey! Listen, we better go right
dialog: to Ronny's dressing room. This kid
dialog: must have taken sixteen hundred
dialog: Quaaludes. I don't think he's
dialog: going to be able to do the show!
text: The fast-tracking group turns the corner. Gail pats Mickey's
text: back; she gestures in exasperation.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing towards heaven)
dialog: Why me, Lord? What did I--
text: He is interrupted by Ed Smythe, an official from the
dialog: Standards and Practices Department, who's been standing in
text: the corridor waiting for Mickey. Mickey stops and shakes
text: Ed's hand as if he'd known the official would be there.
text: Gail stops by his side while the others walk into a
text: background studio doorway that is busy with scurrying
dialog: personnel.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: You--
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Standards and Practices?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ed Smythe, yes.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the
dialog: sketch dirty?
text: (putting his hands on
dialog: his hips)
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Child molestation is a touchy
dialog: subject...
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping, looking
dialog: at Gail)
dialog: Could you--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...with the affiliates.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping and grunting)
dialog: Read the papers! Half the country's
dialog: doing it!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (pointing at Mickey)
dialog: Yes, but you name names.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: We nev-- We don't name names!
dialog: (turning to Gail for
dialog: support, briefly
dialog: touching her
dialog: shoulders, then
dialog: looking back at Ed)
dialog: We say the Pope.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (gesturing emphatically)
dialog: We always say the Pope!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That sketch...
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: We--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...cannot go on the air.
text: A writer, holding a script, walks out of the background
text: studio, looking around.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Oh, Je--
speaker_heading: WRITER
dialog: (interrupting, shouting)
dialog: Hey!
text: Mickey, Gail, and Ed turn towards the writer.
speaker_heading: WRITER
dialog: (angrily, slapping
dialog: his script)
dialog: Who changed my sketch about the PLO?
text: Mickey and Gail walk over to the angry writer, Ed forgotten
dialog: with this new crisis.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I had to make some cuts. It's four
dialog: lousy lines!
speaker_heading: WRITER
dialog: The whole premise is ruined!
text: Mickey, Gail, and the writer start walking down a corridor
text: adjacent to the studio.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: (gesturing, trying to
dialog: calm the writer down)
dialog: Oh, you're crazy! It's not so
dialog: delicate. Everybody's married to
dialog: every line.
text: The writer reacts angrily. Gail tries to get Mickey's
text: attention as they walk.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (tapping Mickey's shoulder)
dialog: Mickey, I can--
speaker_heading: WRITER
dialog: (interrupting,
dialog: angrily gesturing)
dialog: I don't care! I don't want anyone
dialog: tampering with my goddamn work
dialog: without telling me!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: WRITER
dialog: (pointing angrily)
dialog: You want 'em cut?! I'll cut 'em
dialog: myself!
text: Mickey, still in surprised shock, turns away from the angry
text: writer. He stands by an open dressing room, where Ron, an
text: actor, slouches, dazed, in a chair facing a makeup mirror.
text: People mill in the background behind the actor.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (shrugging, distracted)
dialog: All right, all right.
dialog: (muttering)
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (overlapping, trying
dialog: to get Mickey's
dialog: attention and gesturing)
dialog: Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: mind still on the writer)
dialog: You know...

text: writer passes him and
dialog: walks away)
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
text: In-in-in-instead of the child
dialog: molestation sketch, why don't we
dialog: repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald
dialog: Reagan homosexual dance number?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (still distracted,
dialog: looking off)
dialog: No--
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I don't feel good, Mickey.
text: Mickey, remembering Ron, runs into the dressing room. Gail
text: follows him. Inside, a man and a woman talk, ignoring Ron.
text: They share a drink in a paper cup. The woman looks back at
text: Ron; she gestures with disgust.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Yeah, wh-- Yeah, what did you do?
dialog: Swallow a drugstore?!
text: Ron coughs.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (to Gail)
dialog: Look at this guy.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (overlapping, touching
dialog: Ron's chair)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (groaning)
dialog: I lost my voice.
text: Gail walks around the chair. The camera shows she and
text: Mickey talking to Ron through the reflection in the cluttered
dialog: makeup mirror.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Oh, Jesus!
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Ron...Ronny, you know you do have
text: to go on in twenty-five minutes.
text: Ron sighs.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (looking around,
dialog: touching his stomach)
dialog: Hey, does anybody got a Tagamet?
dialog: My, my ulcer's starting to kill me!
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: You want a Quaalude?
text: Mickey, as reflected in the mirror, starts to pace as the
dialog: movie cuts to:
scene_heading: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS BOULEVARD - DAY
text: Norman, a Los Angeles TV producer and Mickey's former
text: partner, is driving down a peaceful street lined with palm
text: trees. He's wearing sunglasses and headphones. He clicks
text: his fingers in time to the music only he hears on his
text: Walkman. He's smiling contentedly while Mickey talks over
text: the sun-filled scene. The continuous background jazz plays
text: louder.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Christ, this show is ruining my
dialog: health! Meanwhile, my ex-partner
dialog: moves to California and every
dialog: stupid show he produces turns out
dialog: to be a big hit. Brother, what am
dialog: I gonna do with my life? Speaking
dialog: of that, I-I...gotta remember to

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT FOYER - DAY
text: As Mickey finishes his ruminations, Hannah is seen walking
text: towards her front door. She opens it, her back to the

text: jazz stops.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Hi! Hi!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping, sniffing)
dialog: I know...I know.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Glad you could put in an appearance.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)

speaker_heading: HANNAH

speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I got two minutes. 'Cause, God, the

dialog: million appointments today. It
dialog: just so happens it fell this way.
text: Hannah continues to nod patiently, patting Mickey on the
text: back, as they make their way across the foyer into the den,
text: where the twins are playing. Mickey wears his coat.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I gotta see new comedians later,
dialog: I've gotta--
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Two minutes on your sons' birthday.
dialog: You know, it's not going to kill you.
text: Her voice trails off as Mickey walks over to the twins.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Happy Birthday, fellas! Happy
dialog: Birthday!
text: Hannah's twins greet Mickey with cries of "Hi, Daddy!" and
text: indistinct chatter.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping their
text: chatter, bending down
dialog: to talk to her sons)
dialog: Guys, look what Daddy brought.
dialog: Presents!
text: Mickey hands a gift to each twin. They grow quiet, suddenly
dialog: shy.
speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing, holding
dialog: out his arms)
dialog: ...a little, uh, hey! A little hug!
dialog: What is this? Now how 'bout a
dialog: little action from the kids?
text: The twins put down their gifts, one on the sofa, one on the
text: coffee table, and hug their father.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (turning to Hannah)
dialog: How is everything?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (picking up the gift
text: on the sofa and nodding)
dialog: Everything's good. Everything's
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (nodding, overlapping)
dialog: Yeah? Yeah?
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Okay, kids, you can open the
text: presents now.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Here, you guys. Open them up.
text: Hannah makes room on the coffee table for the gift she is
text: holding; she places it next to the other one. The boys
text: start opening them.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Let me get a little reaction here.
dialog: (to Hannah, putting
text: his hands in his pockets)
dialog: How's Elliot?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: He's fine.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Oh, you know what? I'm trying to
dialog: convince him to produce a play.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I think he'll find that satisfying.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Really? That'll be terrific for
dialog: him, I think.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I like him. I think he's a sweet
dialog: guy.
speaker_heading: HANNAH

dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
dialog: H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy
dialog: like me...
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping, chuckling)
dialog: I know, I know.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ...so I, so I like that. I always
dialog: like an underconfident person...
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping, touching
dialog: the mitt and reacting)
dialog: That's really nice!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: (still rambling on,
dialog: gesturing to Hannah)
dialog: ...you know? I, uh...
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
text: She helps Twin #2 open his present. It's a football.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: You've always had good taste in
dialog: husbands, so...
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (chuckling and nodding)
dialog: Thanks, thanks.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
speaker_heading: Mh-hm.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (leaning down to look
dialog: at the football)
dialog: That's a beauty!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Isn't that great?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (pointing, to Twin #2)
dialog: Go right over there.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Football!
text: Twin #2, panting, runs offscreen to catch the football.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (to the offscreen twin)
dialog: Come on! Hurry up! Let's go!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: (looking offscreen at
dialog: twin #2)
dialog: Wow!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (still pointing,
dialog: gearing up for the pass)
dialog: Go out, go out by the Sung vase
dialog: and, and catch this.
text: Mickey throws the football.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: See?
dialog: (whistling)
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (pointing offscreen)
dialog: Hey, d-- Watch, watch the picture.
text: There's a sound of breaking glass. Hannah and Mickey react.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY
text: Mickey is walking up a West Side street, his hands in his
text: coat pockets. Jazz plays in the background as he talks over
text: the screen.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Gee, Hannah's sweet. Although,
dialog: sometimes I still do get angry when
dialog: I think of things. Oh, what the
dialog: hell. At least, I'm not paying
dialog: child support.
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Oh, God, I hope there's nothing
dialog: physically wrong with me, either.
text: Mickey pushes open the outside door of Dr. Abel's office, as
text: the movie cuts to the doctor's consultation room. The
text: doctor is framed in the doorway, looking through a file
dialog: cabinet.
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (taking out Mickey's file)
dialog: So what's the, uh, problem this time?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: This time I really think I have
dialog: something.
text: While Mickey answers him offscreen, Dr. Abel turns and walks
text: toward him. The camera follows the doctor's movements from
text: the other side of the wall, obscuring him briefly.
text: It moves across a dark examining-room wall to a second
text: doorway, where Mickey sits on a stool, continuing to talk to
text: the offscreen Dr. Abel.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (onscreen)
dialog: I mean, I'm absolutely convinced
dialog: that-that-- You know, I mean, it's
dialog: not like that adenoidal thing, you
dialog: know, where I didn't realize I had
dialog: them out.
text: Dr. Abel walks back onscreen. Both he and Mickey are now
text: seen through the second doorway. Dr. Abel sniffs and stands
text: directly in front of the sitting Mickey. He stares down at
text: him as Mickey talks.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing, gesturing)
dialog: So, so, but it was when I was
dialog: younger, so--
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (overlapping, interrupting)
dialog: You know, I saw your father this
dialog: week about his sinus...
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: (folding his arms on
dialog: his chest)
dialog: Mm-hm.
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...and, uh, he complained of chest
dialog: pains.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Well, this guy's the real
dialog: hypochondriac of the family. I
dialog: mean, he's, you know, he's--
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You mentioned on the phone that
dialog: you'd had some dizziness.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: (rubbing his hands on
dialog: his knees)
dialog: Yes, a little dizziness, and I
dialog: think, I think I'm developing a
dialog: hearing loss in my right ear
text: (poking at his ears
dialog: and gesturing)
dialog: ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh,
dialog: n-n-n-no. No, I'm sorry. It was
dialog: my right, my right, my right or my
text: left ear.
text: Dr. Abel chuckles.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (nodding and gesturing)
dialog: Now I ca-can't remember.
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: Let's take a look.
text: An uptempo big-band sound is heard as the movie cuts to
text: Mickey's examination, beginning with a close-up of Dr. Abel
text: using an otoscope to examine the ear of a nervous Mickey.
text: Next is a hearing test. The film shows the doctors's hands
text: turning the dials on a sonometer. Mickey sits on a nearby
text: high stool, large earphones on his head. He listens with
text: such concentration that he squints his eyes. He holds up a
text: finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset.
text: Finally, the film shows Dr. Abel hitting a large turning
text: fork with his finger. He puts the vibrating fork to Mickey's
text: ear. Mickey, looking up at the offscreen doctor's face, nods.
text: The music stops as the film cuts back to Dr. Abel's
text: consultation room. Dr. Abel walks from the examining room,
text: through the consultation room, to a second examining room
text: across the way. He talks to the offscreen Mickey as he walks.
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: Well, I'm sorry to say you have had
dialog: a significant drop in the high-
dialog: decibel range of your right ear.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Really?!
text: Dr. Abel moves offscreen in the second examining room. The
text: camera stays focused on the doorway to this room as the
text: doctor and Mickey talk offscreen.
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Have you been exposed to a loud
dialog: noise recently, or did you have a
dialog: virus?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: No, I-I've been perfectly healthy.
dialog: You know me.
text: Dr. Abel briefly passes by the doorway.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I always, I-I always imagine that I
dialog: have things.
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: When did you first notice this?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, uh, about a month ago. Wha-
dialog: what do I have?
text: Looking preoccupied, Dr. Abel walks back into the
text: consultation room, holding Mickey's open file. He strides
text: over to his desk, revealing a frightened Mickey, sitting in
text: a chair opposite it. Still standing, the doctor leans over
text: the desk, his back to the camera, and makes a few notes in
dialog: the file.
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: You've had some dizzy spells.
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: What about ringing and buzzing?
dialog: Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Yes, now-now that you mention it,
dialog: uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and
text: also ringing. Ringing and buzzing.
dialog: Um, am I going deaf, or something?
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (making more notes in
dialog: the file)
dialog: And it's just in one ear?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (picking at his fingers)
dialog: Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to
dialog: have problems in both ears?
text: Dr. Abel chuckles as he closes Mickey's file and straightens
text: up. The camera looks past his back and shoulders to the
text: anxious Mickey.
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (his face offscreen)
dialog: What I'd like to do, is to make an
dialog: appointment for you at the hospital.
dialog: I'd like to have them run some tests.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: The hospital? What kind of tests?
text: Dr. Abel lays his pen across Mickey's closed file. He walks
text: around his desk and sits on its edge close to Mickey.
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Now, don't get alarmed. These are
dialog: just more sophisticated audiometry
dialog: tests than I can run here.
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I mean, it's, it's nothing.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Well, if it's nothing, then why do
dialog: I have to go into the hospital at
dialog: all? I mean, uh, I hear perfectly
dialog: fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak
dialog: on the, on the high decibels. So
dialog: I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (sniffing)
dialog: You know, there's no reason for
dialog: panic. I just want to rule out
dialog: some things.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: DR. ABEL
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: It's nothing. Will you trust me?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
text: Mickey stands in a telephone booth on a corner near Dr.
text: Abel's office; he talks on the phone. It is raining. A man

text: across a nearby intersection.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (into the telephone)
dialog: Huh, uh, hello, Dr. Wilkes? Dr.
dialog: Wilkes, this is Mickey Sachs. You
dialog: have a minute? I want to ask you a
dialog: question.
text: The film cuts to Dr. Wilkes, on the telephone at his end.
text: He is in his office; he leans back in his chair, dangling
text: his stethoscope as he speaks. Behind him, a chest X-ray is
text: mounted on a light panel.
scene_heading: DR. WILKES
dialog: (into the telephone)
dialog: Sure, Mickey. What's up?
text: The movie cuts back and forth between Mickey in his phone
text: booth asking questions and Dr. Wilkes in his office answering
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (into the telephone, gesturing)
dialog: I-if you have, i-if you have a
dialog: hearing loss in one ear, and-and
dialog: it's not from a, uh, virus or a
dialog: loud noise or anything, wh-what are
dialog: the possibilities?
scene_heading: DR. WILKES
dialog: (into his telephone)
dialog: Anything. Uh, often it's hereditary.
dialog: Flu, uh, even a small noise will do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (into the telephone)
dialog: Uh, right, but-but nothing worse?
scene_heading: DR. WILKES
dialog: (into the telephone)
dialog: Well, yes, I guess the, uh, dark

dialog: tumor.
speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Gail, wearing her glasses, stands behind a crowded but well-

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: GAIL

dialog: No, not yet. No.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (looking over his pages)
dialog: Well, let's hope it's good.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: Yeah, really. Really.
text: The assistants walk off. As they leave, Gail calls out
dialog: after them.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: Eh, we'll be down in a minute, okay?
text: The telephone starts to ring, Gail pauses, looking offscreen.
text: She takes off her glasses and squints.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: Mickey, what's the matter with you?
dialog: You're all white!
text: The film cuts to Mickey, who is pacing and wringing his
text: hands. He walks over to Gail. The phone continues to ring.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I feel dizzy. Sshh, you know, I
dialog: don't feel well.
text: He starts to pant, looking worriedly around the room. He
text: continues to wring his hands as Gail stares at him, concerned.
speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: is there a, is there a ringing
dialog: sound?
dialog: (sighing)
speaker_heading: GAIL

dialog: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I hear, I hear

text: Gail hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (turning to Gail,

dialog: Sssss, if I have a brain tumor, I
dialog: don't know what I'm gonna do.
dialog: (sighing)
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: You don't have a brain tumor. He
dialog: didn't say you had a brain tumor.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: No, naturally
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: they're not gonna tell you, because,
dialog: well, you know, th--, sometimes the
dialog: weaker ones will panic if you tell

speaker_heading: GAIL

speaker_heading: MICKEY

speaker_heading: GAIL

speaker_heading: MICKEY

speaker_heading: GAIL

speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: then why does he want me to come
dialog: back for tests?!
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Well, he has to rule out certain

speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Like what?! What?
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: I don't know. Cancer, I--
speaker_heading: MICKEY

speaker_heading: GAIL

speaker_heading: MICKEY

speaker_heading: GAIL

speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: Everyone was pointing back here.
text: He sighs again as Gail, frustrated, gestures impatiently to
text: the papers on the desk.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: Come on, we've got to make some
dialog: booking decisions.
text: Mickey begins pacing around the room again. He wrings his
text: hands and blows on them.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: I can't. I can't think of it.
dialog: This morning, I was so happy, you
dialog: know. Now I, I don't know what
dialog: went wrong.
dialog: (sighing)
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: Eh, you were miserable this morning!
dialog: We got bad reviews, terrible
text: ratings, the sponsors are furious...
speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: his hands)
dialog: No, I was happy, but I just didn't

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The Stanislavski Catering Company in action.
text: Sophisticated pop music plays as the film cuts to:
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - DAY
text: An abstract painting on a wall fills the screen. Light
text: laughter is heard, as well as the sophisticated music;
text: offscreen brunch guests chatter indistinctly.
scene_heading: FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: These things are delicious! What
dialog: in the world are they?
text: Holly walks onto the screen in front of the painting. She
text: holds an almost empty tray of hors d'oeuvres; she wears a
dialog: uniform.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh, um, those are quail eggs.
scene_heading: FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, they're very good.
text: Holly walks past the painting towards the female brunch
text: guest. A man walks in front of her. Chatter, light
text: laughter, and music are still heard; a party is in progress.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah, my friend April makes those.
dialog: (holding out the tray)
dialog: Here, try the shrimp puffs. These
dialog: are delicious.
scene_heading: FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST
dialog: (taking one from the tray)
dialog: Oh, thank you. That looks great.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I make those.
scene_heading: FEMALE BRUNCH GUEST
dialog: Mmm. Thanks.
text: Holly laughs lightly as she walks away from the woman.
text: Holding her tray, she passes a large oval loft window and
text: several clusters of brunch guests. They are eating and
text: drinking. No one pays any attention to her.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (to two male guests
dialog: in her way)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: One of the men, murmuring his thanks, takes a last shrimp
text: puff as Holly passes.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (to the man)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Holly finally makes her way into the cluttered loft kitchen.
text: Her tray is empty.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (offscreen)
text: The Stroganoff is ready.
text: Holly, excited, runs over to April, who is busy taking the
text: Stroganoff out of the oven. She wears the same uniform as
text: Holly: black skirt, white shirt, and black bowtie.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (animatedly)
dialog: We're a big hit.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Oh, in this we're a big hit.
dialog: Yesterday I auditioned for Come
dialog: Back Little Sheba. That, I wasn't
dialog: such a big hit.
text: April, holding the Stroganoff, dashes out of the kitchen to
text: serve the party guests. Holly calls after her, offscreen,
text: as David walks past the hurrying April into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: You will be. You will be. You'll
dialog: get five jobs next week.
text: David walks over to Holly, who is busy at the pot-and-pan-
text: covered stove.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Holly)
dialog: Excuse me, are there any more claims?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing at some
dialog: canapés warming on
dialog: the stove)
text: Only a few. A few.
dialog: (chuckling as David
dialog: takes one)
dialog: Do you like 'em?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't resist.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (busily working at
dialog: the stove)
dialog: Really? How flattering! Did you
dialog: try the shrimp puffs?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (eating a canapé and
dialog: pointing at Holly)
dialog: Listen, you guys are too attractive
dialog: to be caterers. Something's wrong.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: We're actresses.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is this your first job?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (grabbing a quiche
dialog: from an overhead stove)
dialog: Really? Is the food that bad?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Oh no. Not at all.
text: As Holly carries the quiche outside to the party, April
text: comes back into the kitchen from another doorway. Music, as
text: well as the chatter of mingling guests, is heard in the
dialog: background.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: We need more bread and some baked
dialog: lasa--
dialog: (realizing Holly
dialog: isn't there and, at
dialog: the same time,
dialog: noticing David)
dialog: uh, lasagne.
dialog: (turning to David)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (standing by the sink
text: as he wipes his hands
dialog: and mouth with a napkin)
dialog: I know. You're an actress with a
dialog: great flair for shrimp puffs.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (working at the
text: stove, pointing a
dialog: finger for emphasis)
dialog: Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are
dialog: Holly's. I do the, uh, crêpes
dialog: caviar.
text: She walks past David to a counter where she begins to fold
text: napkins. David leans back against the sink.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And the quail is responsible for
text: the quail eggs.
speaker_heading: APRIL
text: (turning to David and chuckling)
dialog: Well, let's hope so.
text: Holly enters the kitchen holding out a plate of clams. She
text: walks over to David.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Here, I stole you a couple of extra
text: clams.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (taking the plate)
dialog: Ah!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (looking busily
dialog: around the room)
dialog: Now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
dialog: Incidentally, I'm David Tolchin.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (turning to David)
dialog: Oh, uh, April Knox. Hi.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (looking at her)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (leaving the counter
text: and squeezing past
dialog: David and Holly)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, moving
dialog: out of April's way)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: April walks offscreen to another area of the kitchen. Holly
text: picks up a napkin from the crowded table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (overlapping Holly's
dialog: apology, turning to her)
dialog: You're Holly.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (nodding, looking at
text: David as she wipes
dialog: her hands with the napkin)
dialog: Yeah, we're the Stanislavski
dialog: Catering Company.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (chewing on a clam canapé)
dialog: Now I'm going to tell you the truth.
dialog: I really came in here because I was
text: bored stiff by the party.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (laughing, still
dialog: wiping her hands)
dialog: What makes you think we're more
dialog: interesting?
text: David walks around the table, putting the plate of clams
text: down on the already crowded surface. Holly follows him,
text: chuckling, throwing her napkin into an offscreen garbage can
text: as David stops at a small television set near the doorway.
text: Guests in the other room can be seen chatting together in
dialog: clusters.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (turning on the set)
dialog: Actually, I'm going to listen to
dialog: Aida, if I'm not getting in your way.
text: Canned laughter and miscellaneous chatter is heard from the
text: television set. David watches the set, still munching on a
text: clam, while Holly and April reassure him offscreen.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: No...no. No--
dialog: (sniffing)
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: Not at all.
text: David checks his wristwatch as Holly walks over to him.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing, fiddling
dialog: with another napkin)
dialog: We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in
dialog: Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (nodding, his hand
text: still on his watch as
dialog: he looks at Holly)
text: I cry at the opera.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (offscreen)
text: Oh, I-I-I go limp in the last scene
dialog: in La Traviata. Limp.
text: Holly chuckles as David, listening to April, impressed,
text: walks over to her. She is standing by the table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (nodding, to April)
dialog: Me, too. I have a private box at
dialog: the Met.
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I bring my little bottle of wine, I
text: open it, I sit there and I watch
dialog: and
dialog: (glancing over to the
dialog: offscreen Holly)
text: I cry. It's disgusting.
text: April chuckles as Holly walks back onscreen; she is busy
text: preparing another tray of hors d'oeuvres.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Oh, what, what do you do?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: I'm an architect.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Wha--
text: (turning to glance at Holly)
dialog: What kind of things do you build?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you really interested?
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What time do you get off?
text: The three exchange glances. Holly shrugs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY
text: A contemporary red building, designed by David, is seen,

speaker_heading: HOLLY

text: back, her head slightly forward.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (gesturing, looking
dialog: back and forth from
dialog: the buildings to
dialog: Holly and April)
dialog: The design's deliberately
dialog: noncontextural. But I wanted to...
dialog: keep the atmosphere of the street,
dialog: you know, and the proportions.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And in the material.
dialog: That's...that's unpolished red
dialog: granite.
dialog: (pausing as he
dialog: watches Holly and
dialog: April's reaction)
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Oh, is that what it is?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (starting to speak)
dialog: Uh--
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (interrupting,
dialog: nodding at Holly)
dialog: I-i-it has an o-organic quality,
dialog: you know.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding, overlapping)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (looking back at the
dialog: building with reverence)
dialog: It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely
dialog: wholly interdependent, if you know
dialog: what I mean. I-I... I can't put it
dialog: into words. The important thing
dialog: is-is-is it-it breathes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (turning to April, emphatically)
dialog: You know, April, people pass by
dialog: vital structures in this city all
dialog: the time, and they never take the
dialog: time to appreciate them. I get the
dialog: feeling you tune in to your
dialog: environment.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Oh--
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (interrupting,
dialog: gesturing and nodding)
dialog: Oh, it's really important.
text: David turns and briefly glances at Holly; he then turns back
dialog: to April.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (looking only at David)
dialog: What are your favorite buildings,
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You want to see some?
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, let's do it.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (looking at David)
dialog: Great.
text: David starts the car and the movie cuts to an unfolding
text: visual excursion through New York City's landmark buildings,
text: as seen from the trio's point of view in the moving Jaguar.
text: Inspiring classical music plays in the background.
text: The series of shots includes the Dakota, complete with
text: surrounding winter trees, the Graybar building on Lexington
text: Avenue, an incredibly ornate building on Seventh Avenue and
text: Fifty-eighth Street, a red-stone church, an old building
text: with embellished, bulging windows on West Forty-fourth
text: Street, the Art Deco Chrysler Building, a red-brick building,
text: Abigail Adams's old stone house, and the Pomander Walk
text: nestled off Broadway on the Upper West Side. The group can
text: be seen walking down the path between the old-fashioned row
text: houses and shrubbery. A lamppost sits in the foreground.
text: It is now dark. The music continues to play as the film
text: cuts to the façade of a rococo-style building, complete with
text: French doors and ornate windows. The admiring group is
text: heard offscreen.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, it's just so romantic. I just
dialog: want to put on a long gown...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen, continuing)
dialog: ...and open the French doors and go
dialog: on the balcony --
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (offscreen, interrupting)
dialog: It's French, though. It really is.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: It feels like you're in France.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: It-it is. It's romantic.
text: The music stops. The screen, which has been exploring the
text: rococo building's façade, now shows the equally elegant
text: building alongside it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: And it's got a handsome partner
text: sitting right beside it.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: They fit right in together. And
dialog: your eye goes along, lulled into
dialog: complacency, and then...
text: The film moves from the two elegant façade to show an ugly,
text: ultra-modern structure covered with tiny, diamond-shaped
dialog: motifs.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: That's just --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (offscreen, interrupting)
dialog: Look at this.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: That's disgusting!
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (offscreen, continuing)
dialog: ...a monstrosity! Who would do that?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: It's really terrible.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (offscreen, emphatically)
dialog: It's really sad.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: And it ruins everything else.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (offscreen, agreeing)
dialog: It does.
text: The film moves from the ugly façade to the building's
text: equally ugly entrance. A large car is parked right in front
text: of the building.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Well...we have seen a lot of stuff
dialog: today, though.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen, chuckling)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: A lot of works.
text: The group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance
text: stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the
text: street, where they'd been gazing at both the lovely and ugly
text: façades across the way. David is in the lead; the women
text: follow, Holly slightly behind April.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (glancing at his watch)
dialog: Maybe we should start thinking
dialog: about going home, huh?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Fast.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Oh, geez, yeah.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapped)
dialog: Okay.
text: They walk towards the car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (looking back at the
text: women as he walks
text: around the car to the
dialog: driver's side)
dialog: Uh, who gets dropped first?
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Uh --
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, looking
dialog: at April)
dialog: Oh, gee, I don't know. Um...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Well, I live downtown.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (glancing at April)
dialog: Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
text: David leans over the roof of the car, looking at the women,
dialog: waiting for their decision.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Uh...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (to David)
dialog: It depends on what way you want to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Well, wait. You know what? I know.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Uh...
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (to Holly, gesturing)
dialog: If...well, if we took the, if we
dialog: took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get
dialog: to your house first, yeah?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (overlapping, nodding)
dialog: We could...we could do that.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so
dialog: jammed, isn't it?
text: She looks at David.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (overlapping, to Holly)
dialog: Well, sometimes, some, uh...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I mean, it's jammed. If we went...
dialog: um...
text: Both she and April mumble awkwardly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (pointing to Holly,
dialog: interrupting their chatter)
dialog: Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding at David)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I-I guess if you live in
dialog: Chelsea, that's probably first.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding nervously)
dialog: Oh, okay.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And then, uh, April...huh?
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (overlapping, nodding)
dialog: Great.
text: They get into the car. Once again Holly's in the backseat.
text: The classical music begins anew.
text: The movie cuts briefly to cut to the traffic and lights of a
text: Manhattan avenue as seen from the moving Jaguar. It then
text: moves to a close-up of Holly, sitting in the backseat, her
text: head near the window. She is staring straight ahead.
speaker_heading: HOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: Naturally I get taken home first.
dialog: Well, obviously he prefers April.
dialog: Of course I was so tongue-tied all
dialog: night. I can't believe I said that
dialog: about the Guggenheim. My stupid
dialog: little roller-skating joke. I
dialog: should never tell jokes. Mom can
dialog: tell 'em and Hannah, but I kill 'em.
dialog: (glaring at the
dialog: offscreen April's back)
dialog: Where did April come up with that
dialog: stuff about Adolph Loos and terms
dialog: like "organic form"?
text: (looking out the side
text: window, pausing for a moment)
dialog: Well, naturally. She went to
dialog: Brandeis.
text: The movie cuts to Holly's point of view: the front seat
text: where David and April sit, the Jaguar's windshield, and the
text: passing lights and traffic of the street. Holly continues
text: her ruminations as April leans over to say something to David.
speaker_heading: HOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: But I don't think she knows what
dialog: she's talking about. Could you
dialog: believe the way she was calling him
dialog: David? "Yes, David. I feel that
dialog: way, too, David. What a marvelous
dialog: space, David."
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: I hate April. She's pushy.
text: The film moves back to Holly in the backseat, still lost in
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: HOLLY (V.O.)
dialog: Now they'll dump me and she'll
dialog: invite him up. I blew it.
text: (sighing, looking out
dialog: the side window)
dialog: And I really like him a lot. Oh,
dialog: screw it. I'm not gonna get all
dialog: upset. I've got reading to do
dialog: tonight. You know, maybe I'll get
dialog: into bed early. I'll turn to a
dialog: movie and take an extra Seconal.
text: The classical music stops and some uptempo jazz begins. The
text: screen cuts to black and a title appears.
dialog: "...nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICK'S LOFT - DAY
text: The movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered
text: door as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby. He
text: looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of
text: view: Frederick's loft building.
text: The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking
text: around him. He glances at his watch as the film cuts back
text: once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears,
text: walking down the street away from Elliot. A truck passes
text: down the street. Lee doesn't see him. She walks further
text: and further away; she turns a corner.
text: Elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of
text: decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the
text: street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street,
text: past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings,
text: as the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different
text: street, oblivious.
text: The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between
text: the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past
text: a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians,
text: some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee,
text: walking up different streets, past different buildings.
text: Lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking
text: right and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on
text: the corner, looking at his watch. She looks up in surprise;
text: the music stops.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (trying not to sound
dialog: out of breath)
dialog: Oh, my goodness!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping, smiling
dialog: in surprise)
dialog: Oh, Elliot!
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (looking around, gesturing)
dialog: Well, I'm-I'm looking for a
dialog: bookstore.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Oh, what, in this section of town?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Yes. Yeah, I-I'm kill--
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: You're out looking here?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
text: (glancing at his
dialog: watch again)
dialog: Well, yes, I'm killing time. I
dialog: have a client near here and I...I'm
dialog: quite early.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Ohhhh!
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: How about you?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Oh. Well, I live--
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (interrupting, chuckling)
dialog: Oh, yes! You live near here, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping, chuckling)
dialog: Yes, I do.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (putting his hands
text: behind his back)
dialog: Where are you headed?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Oh, I was just going to my AA
dialog: meeting.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you
dialog: still go to those? You never tough
dialog: alcohol.
text: They begin to walk down the street.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Well, listen, you didn't know me
dialog: before Frederick. I'd...I'd start
dialog: with a beer at about ten in the
dialog: morning, and...go on.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (looking at Lee)
dialog: Oh. You must have been, uh, very
dialog: unhappy.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yeah, unhappy and fat.
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: And I still find the meetings very
dialog: comforting, you know.
text: She shrugs.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: I'll never understand it. You're
text: so bright and charming and beautiful.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Oh, God.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (overlapping, chuckling)
dialog: I think to myself
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: what problems could she possibly
dialog: have?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (gesturing, laughing)
dialog: Don't let me get started on my
dialog: childhood.
dialog: (stopping in her
dialog: tracks, remembering)
dialog: Oh, you know what? There is a
dialog: bookstore.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (stopping alongside her)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping, pointing)
dialog: A couple of blocks from here. If
dialog: you don't know about it, you should.
dialog: You'd really love it.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah, you would.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (looking around for a
dialog: moment, then gesturing
dialog: to Lee)
dialog: Well, i-if-if you have some free
dialog: time...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah, sure.
dialog: (chuckling)
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Thank you.
text: They begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior
text: of the Pageant Book &amp; Print Shop, an old, serious bookstore.
text: A nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf-
text: like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books.
text: An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the
text: camera moves down an aisle, past the rows of books. A piano
text: playing "Bewitched" is heard. Pictures hang on the aisle
text: ends of the shelves.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Isn't this great?
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: They have everything here.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen, distracted)
dialog: Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: What book did you want to buy?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: What? Book?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Your book? You wanted to buy a book?
text: The camera moves past another aisle of books to reveal Lee,
text: browsing through a shelf.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, book? Oh, no, I...
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I'm killing time. I...I-I just,
dialog: uh, w-want to browse, uh...
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (looking up at a row
dialog: of books)
dialog: Well, you sure picked the right
dialog: place. I mean, you can stay here
dialog: all afternoon, not buy anything and
dialog: just read.
text: She walks down a center aisle, the camera still in its
text: parallel aisle, following her.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Unless, of course, if-if you had
dialog: some time, I mean, we could get
dialog: some coffee.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No, I don't have time.
text: Lee stops at the row where Elliot has been browsing. She is
text: hidden by a shelf; only Elliot is seen as he talks to the
dialog: offscreen Lee.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: No, no. I-I-I understand completely.
dialog: No problem. Y-you're busy. I-I-I...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen, chuckling)
dialog: You seem tense. Is everything all
dialog: right? You feel okay?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: No! No...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing, looking
dialog: at books)
dialog: Uh, yes!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Yes?
text: Elliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same
text: direction Lee had walked up. He continues to talk to her as
text: she remains offscreen in a nearby row.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen
text: momentarily, hidden
text: by a shelf as he talks)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Everything's okay?
dialog: (chuckling)
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Yeah. How are you?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I'm...all right.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen
text: momentarily, hidden
dialog: by another shelf as
dialog: he walks)
dialog: How-how's Frederick?
text: Elliot stops walking to browse through some books.
text: "Bewitched" still plays.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Fine. Oh, we went to the Caravaggio
dialog: exhibition at the Met. It's such a
dialog: treat to go through a museum with
dialog: Frederick. I mean...you learn so
dialog: much. Do you like Caravaggio?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (turning to talk to
dialog: the offscreen Lee)
dialog: Oh, yes. Who doesn't?
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Look!
text: Elliot turns and walks back down the center aisle to a row
dialog: of books he'd already passed.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (pointing to a book
text: on a shelf, continuing)
dialog: e.e. cummings. I'd like to get you
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen, laughing)
dialog: Oh, no, I can't let you get me that.
dialog: That's too much.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (pulling the book off
text: the shelf and browsing
dialog: through it)
dialog: Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh,
dialog: uh, very much.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: No, I don't think so.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing with the
dialog: book, looking at the
dialog: offscreen Lee)
dialog: I-I read a poem of you and thought
dialog: of his last week.
dialog: (nervously laughing,
dialog: trying to correct his mistake)
dialog: A poem of
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: his and thought of you last--
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You'll be fine, though.
dialog: (chuckling)
text: Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle. She looks at
dialog: the book.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Uh, uh, this is great. I mean, I
dialog: love e.e. cummings, but I can't let
dialog: you get this.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (overlapping, patting
dialog: the book)
dialog: Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love
dialog: to get you this.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (looking down at the book)
dialog: Well, sure.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: And-and maybe, um...maybe we could
dialog: discuss it sometime.
text: He hands Lee the book. She thumbs through it, as the movie
dialog: cuts to:
text: The street outside the bookstore. Lee, holding the book in
text: a brown bag, and Elliot are walking out.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (laughing, holding up
dialog: the bag)
dialog: Well, thanks a lot.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (pointing to the bookstore)
dialog: Thanks for showing me the bookstore.
dialog: Perhaps you could, uh, take me to
dialog: an AA meeting sometime. Uh...uh,
dialog: I'd love to see what goes on.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Well, yeah, yeah. You'd love it.
dialog: It's really entertaining. You'd
dialog: have a good time.
dialog: (stepping closer to
text: the curb and hailing
dialog: a cab)
dialog: I know you would.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (pointing to the book)
dialog: And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on
dialog: page a hundred and twelve. It
dialog: reminded me of you.
text: A taxi pulls over to the curb; they walk over to it.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Really? Well...
text: Elliot opens the rear door for Lee. She laughs as she gets
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (leaning down to talk
dialog: to Lee in the cab)
dialog: Page a hundred and twelve.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Bye.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (closing the taxi
dialog: door for Lee)
dialog: Bye.
text: He watches the taxi pull away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FREDERICK'S LOFT BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Lee, in slacks and shirt, is curled up on the bed, her back
text: to the camera, as she reads the e.e. cummings poem in the
text: glow of a night-table lamp. The piano music is still heard.
speaker_heading: LEE (V.O.)
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "your slightest look easily will
dialog: unclose me
dialog: though I have closed myself as
dialog: fingers,
dialog: you open always petal by petal
dialog: myself...
text: As Lee continues to read aloud, the movie cuts to Elliot's
text: darkened den, lit by a light in the hallway. Elliot enters,
text: wearing a robe, crossing the room in the dark.
speaker_heading: LEE (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing reading)
dialog: "...as Spring opens
dialog: [touching skillfully, mysteriously]
dialog: her first rose
dialog: [i do not know what it is about you
text: that closes and opens;
dialog: only something in me understands
dialog: the voice of your eyes is deeper
dialog: than
dialog: all roses]...
text: Elliot turns on a light. The camera stays on his face as he
text: looks off into the distance, mouthing indistinctly the line
text: of poetry Lee next reads.
speaker_heading: LEE (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing reading)
dialog: "nobody, not even the rain, has
dialog: such small hands."
text: The film leaves Elliot's face and cuts back to the loft,
text: where Lee, having finished the poem, sits up in the bed,
text: staring pensively, lost in her thoughts.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The anxiety of the man in the booth.
text: Upbeat jazz begins to play and the film cuts to:
text: The façade of Mount Sinai Hospital. It is day. A few cars
text: whiz by as the film moves inside, to various scenes depicting
dialog: Mickey's comprehensive exam.
text: First is a hearing test, and the movie cuts to a darkened
text: hearing-test room. A light goes on, revealing a slouched-
text: over Mickey sitting in a glass booth. He is wearing a set
text: of headphones. The camera moves back, revealing a technician
text: at the console on the other side of the booth. Mickey
text: signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset.
text: The jazz continues.
text: Next is an electronystagmography (ENG). Graph paper rolls
text: out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling
text: paper, the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified,
text: without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all
text: over his head.
text: The film then cuts to a BSER test room, where Mickey,
text: sitting in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones.
text: An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician
text: sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring
dialog: graph.
text: Last but not least is the tomography. Over the shoulders of
text: a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge,
text: white rotating machine. It makes a whooshing noise as it
text: turns. The camera moves down the giant cranelike device to
text: reveal Mickey, once again lying down, this time on a table,
text: his eyes closed, underneath it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DR. GREY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: A sitting Dr. Grey, his back to the camera, is examining a
text: group of X-rays clipped to the light board behind his desk.
speaker_heading: DR. GREY
dialog: I wasn't too happy with the results
dialog: of your ENG or your BSER either.
text: The doctor turns his chair around to face a tense Mickey
text: sitting on the other side of his desk.
speaker_heading: DR. GREY
dialog: Uh, which is why I sent you to
dialog: Tomography, which was all that
dialog: stuff you saw rolling around.
dialog: (pointing to a spot
dialog: on one of the X-rays)
dialog: You see this little gray area here?
text: Mickey stares at the X-ray, horrified.
speaker_heading: DR. GREY
dialog: That gray area's what I had hoped
dialog: that we wouldn't run into. I'd
dialog: like you to come in Monday morning
dialog: for, uh, a CAT scan.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: A brain scan?
speaker_heading: DR. GREY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Mr. Sachs, let's take one step at a
dialog: time. We won't make any decisions
dialog: until we have all the information
dialog: in front of us, all right?

scene_heading: EXT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Mickey is seen leaving the hospital. He strides slowly, his
text: shoulders slouched, his hands in his pockets.
text: His voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street,
text: continuing his self-absorbed walk on the opposite side.
text: Occasional traffic goes by.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Okay...take it easy. He didn't say
dialog: you had anything. He just doesn't
dialog: like the spot on your X-ray, that's
dialog: all. It doesn't mean you have
dialog: anything. Don't jump to conclusions.
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Nothing's gonna happen to you.
dialog: You're in the middle of New York
dialog: City. This is your town. You're
text: surrounded by people and traffic
dialog: and restaurants.
text: Mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty
text: look. Mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: I mean, God, how can you, how can
dialog: you just one day...vanish? Keep
dialog: calm. You're gonna be okay. Don't
dialog: panic.

scene_heading: INT. MICKEY'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM LOFT - NIGHT
text: The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his
text: bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: I'm dying! I'm dying! I know it!
dialog: There's a spot on my lungs!
text: (sitting up, putting
dialog: on his glasses)
dialog: All right now, take it easy, will
dialog: you? It's not on your lungs. It's
dialog: on your ear. No, it's the same
dialog: thing, isn't it?
dialog: (pulling the sheets
text: off and sitting on
text: the edge of his bed)
dialog: Oh, jeez, I can't sleep! Oh, God,
dialog: there's a tumor in my head the size
dialog: of a basketball!
dialog: (putting on his slippers)
dialog: N-now I keep thinking I can feel it
dialog: every time I blink! Oh, Jesus!
dialog: He-he-he wants me to do a brain
dialog: scan to confirm what he already
dialog: suspects.
text: Mickey, still ruminating, stands up. Fixing his pants, he
text: walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
text: (running his hand
dialog: along a banister)
dialog: Look...I'll make a deal with God.
dialog: Let it just be my ear, okay? I'll
dialog: go deaf. I'll go deaf and blind in
dialog: one eye maybe. But I don't want a
dialog: brain operation! Once they go into
dialog: my skull, I'll-I'll wind up like
dialog: the guy with the, with the wool cap
dialog: who delivers for the florist!
text: He walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, relax, will ya? Your whole
dialog: life you run to doctors. The news
dialog: is always fine.
dialog: (pausing at the
dialog: bottom of the stairs)
dialog: That's not true. What about years
dialog: ago?
text: The film cuts to a flashback of Mickey's past. Dr. Smith,
text: sitting behind his desk, faces the camera. Rows of
text: periodicals line the wall behind him.
scene_heading: DR. SMITH
dialog: (gesturing with one hand)
dialog: I'm sorry to say, Mr. Sachs, that
dialog: you cannot have children.
text: The camera moves to Dr. Smith's point of view: Hannah and
text: Mickey, sitting on the opposite side of the desk. They look
text: stunned.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (reacting, putting
text: his hands across his chest)
dialog: Gee.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Is there no chance?
scene_heading: DR. SMITH
dialog: (getting up from his desk)
dialog: Well, naturally, this doesn't mean
dialog: that you can't have a normal sex
dialog: life.
dialog: (walking over to the
dialog: opened office door
dialog: and closing it)
dialog: But Mr. Sachs's tests indicate that
text: he is infertile. Small sperm
dialog: volume and infertile.
text: The camera moves back to the stunned Mickey and Hannah,
text: following Dr. Smith with their eyes.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing, looking
text: up at an offscreen Dr.
dialog: Smith)
dialog: Isn't there anything I can do?
dialog: Push-ups or hormones?
scene_heading: DR. SMITH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I'm afraid not.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Well, I gotta get a second opinion.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (turning to Mickey)
dialog: This is the second opinion.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Well, then a third opinion.
text: Dr. Smith walks back to his high-backed leather chair behind
text: the desk and sits down. As he talks, the camera moves
text: closer and closer to his face.
scene_heading: DR. SMITH
dialog: I realize this is a blow. My
dialog: experience is that many very fine
dialog: marriages become unstable and are
text: destroyed by an inability to deal
dialog: with this sort of problem. I hope
dialog: you won't make too much of it. One
dialog: can adopt children, and there are
dialog: various artificial methods of
dialog: fertilization.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GROVE STREET IN GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY
text: Mickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk, oblivious of the
text: passing pedestrians. Hannah, crying, blows her nose.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I'm so humiliated. I don't know
dialog: what to say. I mean--
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (interrupting, wiping
dialog: her eyes with her tissue)
dialog: Could you have ruined yourself
dialog: somehow?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: How could I ruin myself? What do
dialog: you mean, ruin myself?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping, looking
dialog: at Mickey)
dialog: I don't know. Excessive
dialog: masturbation?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Hey, you gonna start knocking my
dialog: hobbies? Jesus!
text: Hannah sobs, clutching her tissue to her face.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child.
dialog: He said you could adopt one--
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Well, what about artificial
dialog: insemination?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: You know, where I-I-I would get
text: implanted from a-a donor.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: What, by a st-stranger?
text: Deep in conversation, they cross a tree-lined street. They
text: pass a yellow wood-frame house bordered by a wrought-iron
dialog: fence.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Yeah, they have these banks, you
dialog: know, where they keep them frozen.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid?
dialog: Is that your idea?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I want to experience childbirth.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: With a, with a stranger? With a--
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (interrupting, sniffing)
dialog: Just think about it. That's all I
dialog: ask.
text: They walk offscreen and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickey's
text: living room. The room is brightly lit; it's cluttered with
text: pillows and plants. Norman and Carol, his wife, sit on the
text: couch drinking coffee.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (putting down her cup)
dialog: Oh, that was a wonderful show. I
dialog: think that's the best show you two
dialog: ever wrote.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: (holding his cup,
dialog: pointing emphatically)
dialog: No, the funniest show that Mickey
dialog: and I ever did was the one we won
dialog: the Emmy for.
text: Mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding
text: a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate. The sun
text: pours through the windows he passes. Hannah is briefly seen
text: in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Yeah...I-I think as, I think as far
dialog: as laughs, I mean just plain
dialog: laughs, you know, that was probably
dialog: the best thing that we ever did.
text: Mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is
text: already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo
text: tray holding utensils and napkins.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: Mm-hm.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (overlapping, her
text: hands over her
text: crossed knees and nodding)
dialog: Yeah, it was funny, it was very
dialog: funny. But the show was about the
dialog: two Frenchmen, now that was funny
dialog: and it was warm.
text: Mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch. He rubs
text: his forehead.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (to Carol, gesturing
dialog: with his cup)
dialog: We got that idea on that trip to
dialog: Paris.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (to the offscreen Hannah)
dialog: Do you remember that summer in
dialog: France? Hannah, you had jet lag
dialog: for six straight weeks.
text: Norman chuckles.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: (sighing, almost mumbling)
dialog: Yeah, but it was, you know, I guess
dialog: we had fun when we were there and,
dialog: you know, it's just, I--
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (overlapping, nodding)
dialog: Mm-hm.
text: Hannah walks over to the group, holding a pot of coffee.
text: She awkwardly steps past Mickey to pour coffee for Norman
dialog: and Carol.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (to Mickey)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (to Norman and Carol)
dialog: Coffee? Listen, you guys, we
dialog: were-- You want some more?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (holding out his cup)
dialog: Mmm.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (refilling Norman's cup)
dialog: We-we...we had something we-we
dialog: really wanted to discuss with you.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping, coughing)
dialog: Yeah...
text: Hannah refills Carol's cup. She puts the pot down on the
text: coffee table and sits down next to Mickey.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (standing up and gesturing)
dialog: Jeez, this is, this is, this is
dialog: very delicate and-and I only bring
dialog: this up amongst friends, you know.
text: He starts to pace. Hannah, her hands clasped near her face,
text: glances briefly at Carol.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (turning to the group
text: as he paces behind
dialog: the couch)
dialog: I mean...
dialog: (grunting)
dialog: this is, uh... this should not go
dialog: any further than this room.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (sipping his coffee)
dialog: I'm all ears.
text: Hannah sighs. Mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his
dialog: thoughts.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing and pacing)
dialog: Hannah and I...can't have any
dialog: children. Now I-I-I don't want to
dialog: get into whose fault it--
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: It's my fault that we can't and-
dialog: and-and the details are too
dialog: embarrassing to--
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (interrupting,
text: nervously picking at
dialog: her fingers)
dialog: W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of
dialog: discussion that we-we'd try with
dialog: artificial insemination.
text: Mickey stops his pacing and looks at the group.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: (putting his hands on
dialog: his hips)
dialog: Yeah, I'm not so sure that I, that
dialog: I like that idea myself, anyway--
text: He starts to pace behind the couch anew.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Um, I-I didn't really want to, you
dialog: know, go to a sperm bank or
dialog: something, have some anonymous
dialog: donor.
dialog: (gesturing at Norman
dialog: and Carol)
dialog: I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't
dialog: want that.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (pacing)
dialog: Right. We felt that if we were
dialog: gonna do it, that we would like
dialog: somebody who we knew and who we
dialog: liked and who was warm and bright
dialog: and...
text: Norman and Carol remain silent.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: And you can say no... you know.
dialog: Feel free to say no. W-we realize
dialog: it has all kinds of implications.
text: Mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind Norman.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Yeah, but the-the point that, uh,
dialog: that we're making here is that we
dialog: need some sperm.
text: Mickey, rubbing his hands on his knees, leans back against
text: the wall. Norman and Carol turn to each other, reacting.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Gee.
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Well... My first reaction after the
dialog: initial shock is, uh, flattered
dialog: that you would ask me.
dialog: (chuckling nervously)
text: Carol glances at Norman.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (pointing at himself)
dialog: Yeah, well, I would be the father.
dialog: (pointing to Norman)
dialog: You would just have to masturbate
text: into a little cup.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: I can handle that.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (scooting closer to
dialog: Carol and Norman on
dialog: the couch, gesturing)
dialog: Obviously we wou-wouldn't have
dialog: intercourse.
text: She chuckles nervously.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (to Hannah, chuckling
dialog: nervously briefly)
dialog: Gosh, listen.
dialog: (rubbing her nose)
dialog: I've gotta tell you the truth here.
dialog: I'm a little uneasy about this.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: (putting her hand on
dialog: Carol's shoulder)
dialog: Carol, I know it's a lot to ask.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Well...I feel for you. I do.
dialog: I...I'm gonna cry. You want my
dialog: husband to have a child with you?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Ye-- D-d-d-don't answer now. Just,
dialog: you know, take it home and think
dialog: about it for a while.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: (holding his coffee
dialog: cup, thoughtful)
dialog: I gave blood before and, uh...
dialog: clothing to the poor.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (to Norman, scratching
dialog: her ear)
dialog: Okay, Norman, listen, I really want
dialog: to talk about this at home.
dialog: (nodding as Hannah
dialog: looks briefly
dialog: offscreen at Mickey)
dialog: I think it's a matter for your
dialog: analyst...and mine.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: And maybe my lawyer.
text: He takes a sip of coffee.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: You know, we-we understand
dialog: completely if, you know, if you
dialog: feel you'd-you'd rather not.
dialog: (chuckling nervously)
dialog: I didn't mean to spoil the evening.
dialog: (rubbing her hands)
dialog: Now let's move on to another topic.
text: Hannah reaches for the cake as Carol and Norman exchange
text: glances, reacting.
text: The flashback ends. Mickey is back in the present in his
text: darkened living room, illuminated by a glow from a window
text: behind the couch. A coffee table sits in front of the couch.
text: Papers are scattered on the floor. Mickey gets up from the
text: couch where he'd been sitting. He paces back and forth as
text: he talks over the screen.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: So you had my ex-partner's baby.
dialog: Twins. Maybe that did cause some
dialog: trouble, but
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: I think we were drifting apart
dialog: anyhow. Now instead of man and
dialog: wife we're just good friends. Boy,
dialog: love is really unpredictable.

scene_heading: INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Manon Lescaut is being performed. Onstage, the soprano in
text: the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the
text: ruins of a wagon. The background is dark. The film moves
text: up to the private boxes in the upper loge. David and Holly
text: can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes.
text: David glances at her; he reaches down for a bottle of wine.
text: The movie briefly cuts back to the stage. The soprano is
text: leaning on a wagon wheel; her voice soars. Then it's back
text: to a closer look at Holly and David in their box. The aria
text: continues as David hands a smiling Holly a glass. He
text: uncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses.
text: Holly mouths a thank you, glancing around. They look at
text: each other and raise their glasses in a toast.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: Dusty bought this huge house in Southampton.
text: The opera audience is heard cheering, applauding, and
dialog: sounding their "Bravos."
text: The clapping stops as the movie cuts to Frederick's loft.
text: It is day. Lee, wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, has
text: opened the door for Elliot and his client, wealthy rock star
dialog: Dusty Frye.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (leading the way into
dialog: the loft, gesturing)
dialog: Lee, Frederick...say hello to Dusty
dialog: Frye.
text: Lee closes the door behind the men and walks over to Dusty.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (shaking Dusty's hand)
dialog: Hi, Dusty.
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: Hi.
text: Lee chuckles as she looks at him; he is wearing sunglasses,
text: a red-imprinted T-shirt, and a baggy coat. She turns and
text: walks with Frederick, Elliot, and Dusty farther into the
text: loft, her hands clasped behind her back.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (as he walks)
dialog: Dusty's just bought a huge house in
dialog: Southampton and he's in the process
dialog: of decorating it.
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: Yeah. It's kind of a weird place,
dialog: actually. A lotta wall space.
dialog: (chuckling)
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Oh.
text: They walk into the living room area of the loft, where
text: Frederick, his hands in his pockets, neatly attired in vest
text: sweater and white shirt, stands, waiting.
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: (to Frederick, giving
dialog: him a "hip" handshake)
dialog: How ya doin', man?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (to a less than
dialog: enthusiastic Frederick)
dialog: I told him about your work, and
text: he's very excited.
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol. And I
dialog: got a Frank Stella, too. Oh, it's
dialog: very beautiful.
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Big, weird...you know.
text: (chuckling as he
text: crosses his arms on
dialog: his chest)
dialog: If you stare at that Stella too
text: long, the colors just seem to float.
dialog: It's kinda weird.
text: Frederick covers his face to hide his disgust.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (chuckling, her arms crossed)
dialog: Are you excited about becoming a
dialog: collector?
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: I got a lot more to learn, though.
dialog: I really wasn't into art when I was
text: a kid.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (addressing but not
dialog: looking at Dusty)
dialog: Do you appreciate drawings?
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Yeah.
text: (chuckling as he
dialog: notices and points to
dialog: some offscreen
dialog: drawings Frederick
dialog: has set up)
dialog: Oh! Hey! Wow!
dialog: (pointing to an
dialog: offscreen nude drawing)
dialog: She's beautiful. But, uh, really,
dialog: I-I-I-I need something... I'm
dialog: looking for something big.
text: As Dusty talks, the camera follows Elliot, who walks past
text: the others to examine the drawings more closely. Two framed
text: nude drawings of Lee are propped up on an easel. Elliot
text: glances admiringly at the drawings, then surreptitiously at
text: Lee, admiring her body as she converses with an offscreen
text: Dusty and Frederick.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (looking at an
dialog: offscreen Frederick, gesturing)
dialog: Big. Frederick, show him the oils.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (offscreen)
text: They're in the basement.
text: The camera leaves Elliot to follow the enthusiastic Lee as
text: she takes Dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the
text: door. Frederick follows at a distance.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (to Dusty)
dialog: Frederick's done this whole new
dialog: series that I'm sure you would
dialog: really love.
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: (overlapping, muttering)
dialog: Well, are...are they big?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yeah. Some of them...yeah, some of
dialog: them are very big.
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: 'Cause I got a lot of wall space
dialog: there.
dialog: (chuckling)
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (angrily stopping in
dialog: his tracks)
dialog: I don't sell my work by the yard!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (chuckling, reacting)
dialog: Oh, Frederick!
text: The camera now moves back to Elliot, still staring at the
text: nude drawings, as the sounds of Frederick's and Dusty's
text: footsteps are heard leaving the loft. He turns and
text: hesitantly smiles to an offscreen Lee.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (chuckling softly)
dialog: How's everything?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (walking onscreen
dialog: towards Elliot)
dialog: Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah
dialog: this morning on the phone, and she
dialog: said that you two might be going to
dialog: the country for the weekend.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Yeah, she loves to go out in the
dialog: woods.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (nodding, her arms
text: clasped around her chest)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: But I go nuts. It's a conflict.
text: He laughs. Lee, uneasy, looks down.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I have to get my teeth cleaned this
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Oh, that's nice.
text: There's an awkward moment of silence.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (breaking the silence,
text: pointing in the
dialog: direction of the door)
dialog: I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick
dialog: and Dusty together.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (looking in the same
dialog: direction, gesturing)
dialog: Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Yes. This kid, he's earned a
dialog: trillion dollars.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding, wrapping
text: her arms around her
dialog: chest again)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: He's got like six gold records.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (gesturing, relieved
dialog: that she's found
dialog: something to say)
dialog: Oh, speaking of records...I bought
dialog: that Mozart Trio you recommended...
text: The camera follows Lee as she walks quickly to the stereo
text: unit, pulling a record off the shelf.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...and the man in the record shop
dialog: showed me another one that I think
dialog: you'd love. It's a... another
dialog: Bach, second movement.
text: She pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the
text: turntable.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, you-you have that one?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (working at the
text: stereo, turning her
dialog: head towards Elliot)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, I would love to hear it.
text: Bach's Concerto for Harpsichord fills the room.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (putting the turntable
dialog: cover in place)
dialog: Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man
text: who loves opera. An architect.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, that's nice. I'd love to see
text: her wind up settled. She's a tense
dialog: one.
dialog: (chuckling)
text: The record in place, Lee turns and leans back against the
text: stereo unit. She listens to the music, her eyes closed.
text: The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room, as
text: Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near her.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (intently)
dialog: Isn't that beautiful?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
text: (looking at Lee, his
text: hands clasped in
dialog: front of him)
dialog: I know this. Bach. F Minor
dialog: Concerto. It's one of my favorites.
text: Lee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head
text: down; Elliot stares at her.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Uh...did you ever get around to e.e.
dialog: cummings?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (wrapping her arms
text: around her chest and
text: looking away from
dialog: Elliot for a moment)
dialog: Yes, he's just adorable.
text: Elliot nods.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: They have a very large gay
dialog: clientele, you know, where I get my
dialog: teeth cleaned, and...all the
dialog: hygienists now wear gloves because
dialog: they're afraid of AIDS.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (taking a breath)
dialog: Oh, right.
text: There is another moment of silence. Elliot stares at Lee,
text: who continues to look down, her arms around her chest. The
text: harpsichord plays on.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Did you ever get around to the poem
dialog: on page a hundred and twelve?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yes, it made me cry
dialog: (tentatively looking
dialog: at Elliot)
dialog: it was so beautiful...so romantic.
text: Lee looks down again; the music plays softly and Elliot
text: continues to stare at her, thinking.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: I want so badly to kiss her. Not
dialog: here, you idiot. You've got to get
text: her alone someplace.
text: As Elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, Lee glances
text: around the loft, then begins to walk away. The camera
text: follows her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become
text: the focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: But I've got to proceed cautiously.
dialog: This is a very delicate situation.
dialog: Okay, uh...ask her if you can see
dialog: her for lunch or a drink tomorrow.
text: Lee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings.
text: She takes the e.e. cummings book from the shelf and flips
text: through it as she walks back to Elliot, who is still leaning
text: by the stereo, still ruminating.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: And be ready to make light of the
dialog: offer if she's unresponsive. This
dialog: has to be done very skillfully,
dialog: very diplomatically.

dialog: Did you ever read this one--?
text: Elliot leaps up, grabs Lee, and kisses her passionately.
text: Lee, surprised, pushes him away.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Elliot! Don't!
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Lee! Lee! Lee, I'm in love with
dialog: you.
text: He kisses Lee again. He clumsily turns around; she humps
text: against the stereo unit. As Lee pulls away, she smashes
text: into the turntable. The needle scratches loudly. Lee,
text: shocked, is gasping. The record, pushed to a different part
text: of the concerto, now plays a more complicated, faster fugue.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (breathing hard)
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (frantically)
text: I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I have
dialog: to talk to you for... There's so
dialog: much that I want to tell you.
text: Lee stares at Elliot in shock.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (still gasping)
dialog: Elliot!
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing desperately)
dialog: I have been in love with you for so
dialog: long.
text: Frederick and Dusty's indistinct voices, raised in argument,
text: are suddenly heard. Elliot quickly turns away from Lee.
text: She tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft
text: entranceway. Frederick enters the loft first, followed by a
text: confused Dusty. They stride across the loft past Lee, who
text: is standing by the stereo. Elliot, standing near the nude
text: drawings, is looking through a book.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Please forget it! I don't have any
dialog: interest in selling anything!
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I ask you if you have something
dialog: with a little puce in it, you gotta
dialog: fly off the handle!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (in a slightly
dialog: higher-pitched voice)
dialog: What's the problem?
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (pulling the nude
dialog: drawings off his
dialog: easel angrily)
dialog: I'm not interested in what your
dialog: interior decorator would think,
dialog: okay?!
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
dialog: Well, I can't commit to anything
text: without consulting her first.
dialog: That's what I have her for, okay?
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (carrying the drawings
dialog: off)
dialog: This is degrading! You don't buy
dialog: paintings to blend in with the sofa!
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: (looking after Frederick)
dialog: It's not a sofa, it's an ottoman!
dialog: (touching his
text: forehead, turning to Elliot)
dialog: God, forget it! Let's just get
dialog: outta here, Elliot.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (putting down the book)
dialog: We'll go.
text: The film moves outside the loft building. Dusty and Elliot
text: emerge and walk to Dusty's waiting limousine. Elliot is
text: rubbing his forehead, anguished.
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: (angrily, getting
dialog: into the car)
dialog: What a weirdo that guy is! Paranoid.
dialog: (noticing Elliot's
dialog: anguished face)
dialog: What's the matter with you?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: It's not that big a deal. We just
dialog: didn't hit it off.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: Are you okay? You look-- You're
dialog: sweatin'.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (overlapping, nervously)
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, I just-just need so-
dialog: some-some fresh air. It's probably
dialog: something I ate. I'll-I'll walk.
dialog: You go ahead.
text: Dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door.
text: Elliot leans down to the chauffeur's window, signaling for
text: him to start driving.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (continuing, gesturing)
dialog: You go. Go on. Go.
text: The limousine drives off. Elliot runs to a phone booth
text: across the street. He picks up the phone and dials.
text: The film cuts to Frederick in his loft, standing near the
text: phone. It rings. Frederick picks it up.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (into the telephone)
dialog: Hello? Hello? Hello?
text: When no one answers, Frederick, reacting, hangs up, and the
text: film moves back outside to the phone booth, where Elliot,
text: the phone receiver to his ear, listens for a moment, then
text: hangs up. He walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks
text: down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic Lee, just
text: turning the corner.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (gesturing in relief)
dialog: Oh! There you are!
text: Elliot mumbles, relieved and confused.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I was looking for you.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm
dialog: sorry. I'm so mixed up.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Well, how do you expect me to react
dialog: to such a thing?
text: Elliot, uneasy, glances up in the direction of Frederick's
text: loft. He leads Lee a few yards up the street, away from any
text: prying eyes.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (taking Lee's arm)
dialog: Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am
dialog: in love with you.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Oh, don't say those words!
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (overlapping, shaking
dialog: his head)
dialog: I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's
dialog: terrible.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (pushing back her
text: hair, shaking her
dialog: head hopelessly)
dialog: Why, you know the situation.
text: She sighs.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (looking away for a moment)
dialog: I know! I-I-I-I, I realize.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What do you expect me to say?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Hannah and I are in the last stages.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Wh-- She's never said anything, and
dialog: we're very close. She'd tell me
dialog: such a thing.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad.
dialog: She's crazy about me, but somewhere
dialog: on the, along the line, I've fallen
text: out of love with her.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Not because of me, I hope.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Oh, no, no.
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Well, yes! I love you.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Oh, I can't be the cause of anything
dialog: between you and Hannah. I jus--
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (overlapping, shaking
dialog: his head)
dialog: Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it-
dialog: it was i-inevitable that Hannah and
dialog: I part, anyway.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: But not over me?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Tch, no! We were, we were both
text: going in different directions.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (looking down)
dialog: Poor Hannah.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: But-but, but how about you? Do
dialog: you, do you share any of my feelings?
dialog: Or is this just an unpleasant
dialog: embarrassment to you?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (reacting uneasily)
dialog: I can't say anything!
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: W-well, please be candid. I, I-I
dialog: don't want you to feel bad.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (putting her hand to
dialog: her head)
dialog: Yes! But I...I have certain
dialog: feelings for you, but don't make me
dialog: say anything more, all right?
text: Lee looks at him.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You,
dialog: you, y-you've said enough. It's my
dialog: responsibility now. I will work
dialog: things out.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Look, don't do anything on my
dialog: behalf.
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: I live with Frederick, and Hannah
dialog: and I are close.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Yes, but you, you do care about me.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Oh, Elliot, please! I can't be a
dialog: party to this! I'm suddenly
text: wracked with guilt just standing
dialog: her talking to you on the street!
text: She sighs.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: Your guilt is because you feel the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Oh, please, I have to go. I have
dialog: to get my teeth cleaned.
text: She walks off. Elliot stares after her, grinning.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (happily)
dialog: I have my answer. I have my answer!
dialog: I'm walking on air!
text: He laughs.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER OUTSIDE EVAN AND NORMA'S APARTMENT
scene_heading: BUILDING - DAY
text: A taxi turns a West Side street corner and stops in front of
text: Evan and Norma's building, which is decorated with a long
text: metal awning. It's an overcast day.
text: A station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls
text: away as Hannah, a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder,
text: gets out of the cab. She runs into the building; the taxi
text: drives away. A piano plays "Bewitched" over the screen.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EVAN AND NORMA'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Evan, his back to the camera, walks to the front door and
text: opens it to Hannah.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Hi. How's she doing?
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I am glad to see you.
text: Hannah takes off her shoulder bag and her coat as her
text: aggravated father walks past her towards the kitchen. He
text: passes a wall with an ornate mirror and some framed
dialog: photographs.
speaker_heading: EVAN
text: She's in the kitchen there. It's
dialog: the same thing. Same thing. She
dialog: promises, promises.
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: But it's all lies.
text: Through a doorway, Norma can be seen sitting on a chair in
text: the kitchen. She wears a robe over a slip and stockings;
text: she's drinking. Evan stands in the doorway looking at her;
text: he doesn't go in.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen, patiently)
dialog: Don't make it worse, Dad.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Always.
text: Hannah hurriedly passes her father and enters the kitchen;
text: her mother takes a sip of her drink.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Hi, Mom. How you doing? Here, let
dialog: me get you some coffee. That's
dialog: enough of that.
dialog: (taking away her
dialog: mother's drink, to Evan)
dialog: What triggered it?
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (gesturing, as Norma
text: turns her head and
dialog: watches him)
dialog: We were making a commercial down at
dialog: the mayor's office, and there was
dialog: this young, good-looking salesman...
text: Norma reacts, turning to her daughter. Hannah, however, has
text: her back turned. She is busy taking charge in the kitchen
text: as Evan speaks. She takes some pills out of a cupboard and
text: hands them to her mother with a glass of water.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...and your mother was throwing
text: herself at him in a disgusting way,
dialog: and when she found she was too old
dialog: to seduce him, that he was just
dialog: embarrassed by her--
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (angrily interrupting,
dialog: turning her head)
dialog: Liar! Liar!
text: The camera moves to Evan, who continues to tell his story,
text: ignoring his wife's outburst, as he walks away from the
text: kitchen doorway into the den.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Then at lunch she got drunker and
dialog: drunker
text: (shouting over his shoulder)
dialog: and finally she became Joan Collins!
text: Evan walks over to the piano, where several framed family
text: photographs sit in a line on its top. He picks one up as
text: Norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: All my life I've had to put up with
dialog: insults...
text: The camera moves back to the kitchen as Norma talks. She is
text: still glaring offscreen at the doorway where Evan stood
text: moments before. She holds the water glass and the pills.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (continuing, dramatically)
dialog: ...from this non-person, this, th-
dialog: th-this haircut that passes for a
dialog: man.
text: (turning to look at
dialog: the offscreen Hannah)
dialog: He could never support us. It's a
dialog: good thing we had a talented
dialog: daughter!
text: Evan is back in the doorway, listening to Norma, getting
text: more and more angry. As he makes a retort, he starts to
text: walk back to the den and his piano.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: I can only hope that she was mine.
dialog: With you as her mother
text: (gesturing, his voice
dialog: getting louder)
dialog: her father could be anybody in
dialog: Actors' Equity!
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: She's talented...so it's not likely
dialog: she's yours!
dialog: (taking a sip of water)
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (walking over to the
dialog: doorway to speak to
text: Evan, who's already
dialog: fuming in the den)
dialog: Dad, could you just please stay in
dialog: the other room and let me take care
dialog: of her?
text: Hannah goes back to Norma; she takes the glass of water away.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (offscreen, choosing
dialog: to ignore Hannah's suggestion)
dialog: You never know when she's going to
text: fall off the wagon and humiliate
dialog: everybody.
text: Hannah, choosing to ignore Evan's remark, hands her mother a
text: cup of coffee; she puts her mother's hands on the cup.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Here, Mom. Drink this.
dialog: (leaning against a
dialog: kitchen counter)
dialog: You know, you're awful. You
dialog: probably were flirting.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (sipping her coffee)
dialog: No! I like to joke around and have
dialog: fun, and he gets angry because I
dialog: get the attention. He's gotten
text: sourer as he's gotten older, and
dialog: I've tried to stay young...at heart.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: You promised to stay on the wagon.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: The sacrifices I've made because of
dialog: that man.
dialog: (inhaling)
dialog: He's ruined me with his ego, his
dialog: philandering, his--
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: his-his-his-his mediocrity!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Okay, stop being so dramatic.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (shouting to the
dialog: offscreen Evan)
dialog: He's the one that's made every
dialog: ingenue in stock!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Okay, okay.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (touching Hannah's
dialog: arm, gasping)
dialog: Th-th-they, they wanted me for a
dialog: screen test.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: Yeah, I know, Mom.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: But I, I knew that he'd get up
text: there and he'd flounder around with
text: his expensive haircuts and hairdos
dialog: and clothes. He's all show!
dialog: (touching Hannah's
dialog: arm again, then
dialog: touching her chest)
dialog: Now how can you act when there's
dialog: nothing inside to come out?!
text: Norma sips her coffee, softly sobbing. Hannah, reacting,
text: walks away from the counter and, capping the bottle of
text: pills, puts them back in the cupboard. Evan plays the piano
text: offscreen. The camera moves in on Hannah's face as she
text: reflects, her voice heard over the screen.
speaker_heading: HANNAH (V.O.)
dialog: She was so beautiful at one time,
dialog: and he was so dashing. Both of
dialog: them just full of promise and hopes
dialog: that never materialized.
text: The camera leaves Hannah's face as she continues to reflect;
text: it moves to the den, to the row of family photos on the
text: piano: one of a present-day Evan and Norma, others where
text: both Norma and Evan are young, beautiful, hopeful. The
text: music plays on.
speaker_heading: HANNAH (V.O.)
dialog: And the fights and the constant
dialog: infidelities to prove
text: themselves...and blaming each other.
dialog: It's s-sad. They loved the idea of
dialog: having us kids, but raising us
dialog: didn't interest them much. But
dialog: it's impossible to hold it against
dialog: them. They didn't know anything
dialog: else.
text: The film cuts back to the kitchen. Norma stands up; Hannah
text: takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: You know, of all of us in the
dialog: family, you were the one blessed
dialog: with the true gift.
text: She puts her arm around Hannah's shoulder. Mother and
text: daughter walk out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (holding the hand her
dialog: mother had placed on
dialog: her shoulder)
dialog: Ohhh, my true gift is luck, Mom.
text: Norma chuckles.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I just had a lot of luck...from my
dialog: first show, you know? I've always
dialog: thought Lee was the one destined
dialog: for great things.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't
dialog: have your spark.
dialog: (gesturing and chuckling)
dialog: She knows it. She worships you.
dialog: She wouldn't dare get up there on
dialog: the stage.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (looking at her mother)
dialog: Now, Holly's not shy.
text: They stop at the entrance to the den. Evan can be seen
text: playing the piano as they continue their conversation.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: No, Holly's game for anything.
text: Holly takes after me.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: True.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: I'd have been a great dope addict.
text: Norma chortles. Hannah laughs, touching her mother. They
text: walk over to Evan at the piano.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Remember this, Hannah?
text: Evan plays a few bars of "You Are Too Beautiful" as mother
text: and daughter, their backs to the camera, listen. Norma
text: leans over the piano; Hannah looks off into the distance,
text: deep in reflection. The piano music continues in the
text: background as the movie cuts to:
text: Lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront. The wind blows
text: her hair; she hugs the e.e. cummings book to her chest.
text: She, too, is deep in thought. She stops at the edge of the
text: wharf; the camera continues to move, to a group of wooden
text: pilings nearby, lapped by the water.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The abyss.
text: The piano piece ends and the film is quiet.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CAT-SCAN ROOM - DAY
text: The quiet continues as the film cuts to a close-up of a
text: large, circular CAT-scan module in an antiseptic hospital
text: room. A slowly moving stretcher, bearing Mickey's strapped
text: prone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module.
text: As the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under
text: the scan, two technicians can be seen through the window
text: separating the scanner from the control room. One of them,
text: sitting down, taps information into a computer while the
text: other technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the
text: computer screen.
text: The movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing
text: an image of Mickey's skull. Scan lines bleep over the skull.
text: The camera moves up from the screen to reveal Mickey once
text: again, as seen through the window, silent and serious under
text: the CAT-scan module.
text: From Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two
text: technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room.
text: They examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to
text: each other. One of the men, nodding, taps more information
text: into the computer.
text: While they're studying the CAT-scan picture, the camera cuts
text: to a back view of Mickey under the module. There is a
text: science-fiction feel to this scene, as if Mickey is lying in
text: the center of a huge, white, futuristic circle. The
text: stretcher, bearing Mickey, slowly moves out of the module.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DR. BROOK'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Dr. Brooks, holding Mickey's X-rays, walks past a row of
text: bookshelves to his light panel. He props up the X-rays.
scene_heading: DR. BROOKS
dialog: Mr. Sachs,
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: I'm afraid the news is not good.
text: Dr. Brooks turns to an offscreen Mickey.
scene_heading: DR. BROOKS
dialog: (continuing, taking a
text: pencil out of his pocket)
dialog: If I can show you exactly where the
dialog: tumor is, and why we feel that
dialog: surgery would be of no use.
text: The film quickly cuts to a close-up of Mickey's face,
text: reacting in total despair. He closes his eyes; he covers
text: his face with his hand.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
text: It's over. I'm face-to-face with
dialog: eternity.
scene_heading: DR. BROOKS
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: ...grown quite large without being
dialog: detected...
dialog: (trailing off
text: indistinctly as
text: Mickey continues his
text: anguished ramblings)
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Not later, but now. I'm so
dialog: frightened I can't move, speak, or
dialog: breathe.
text: As Mickey finishes his speech, the "real" Dr. Brooks is seen
text: walking into the office. The previous scene had been a
text: figment of Mickey's imagination, a nightmare fantasy only.
text: Holding Mickey's X-rays, the "real" Dr. Brooks walks past
text: the same row of books to the light panel.
scene_heading: DR. BROOKS
dialog: Well, you're just fine. There's
dialog: absolutely nothing here at all.
dialog: And your tests are all fine.
dialog: (switching on the
text: light on the panel
dialog: and propping up the
dialog: X-rays)
dialog: I must admit, I was concerned,
dialog: given your symptoms.
text: (turning to look at
dialog: the offscreen Mickey)
dialog: What caused this hearing loss in
dialog: one ear, I guess we'll never really
dialog: know for sure. But whatever it
dialog: was, it's certainly not anything
dialog: serious at all.
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: I'm very relieved.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Once again, Mickey is seen leaving the building, but this
text: time he bounds down the steps, jumping for joy. He runs
text: swirling down the street, clapping his hands, happy with
text: relief. Upbeat, uptempo jazz plays in the background.
text: Several cars pass as Mickey joyfully runs. Suddenly he
text: stops, his hand to his mouth, reflecting.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: What do you mean you're quitting?
dialog: Why? The news is good! You don't

speaker_heading: MICKEY

speaker_heading: GAIL

speaker_heading: MICKEY

speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Yeah...but you're not dying!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: No, I'm not dying now, but, but
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: you know, when I ran out of the
dialog: hospital, I, I was so thrilled
dialog: because they told me I was going to

dialog: I'm okay. I'm not going to go
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: But eventually, I'm going to be in
dialog: that position.
text: Gail gets up from her chair. She walks past Mickey to a
text: nearby cabinet. She opens a drawer, rummaging around for
text: something. The camera follows her, leaving Mickey briefly.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: You're just realizing this now?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Well, I don't realize it now, I
dialog: know it all the time, but, but I
text: managed to stick it in the back of
dialog: my mind...
text: As Mickey continues to talk offscreen, Gail closes the
text: cabinet drawer and walks to a file cabinet behind Mickey's
dialog: desk.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: ...because it-it's a very horrible
dialog: thing to... think about!
text: Gail opens the file cabinet and takes out a pack of gum.
text: She slams it closed, distracted.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Yeah. What?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (turning to Gail)
dialog: Can I tell you something? Can I
dialog: tell you a secret?
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (nodding impatiently
text: as she walks around
dialog: the desk)
dialog: Yes, please.
speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: A week ago, I bought a rifle.
speaker_heading: GAIL

dialog: of a chair near Mickey)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: everything for you? That makes
dialog: everything...
text: Gail sighs. She pops a piece of gum into her mouth as
text: Mickey continues to speak.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...you know it, it just takes the
dialog: pleasure out of everything.
dialog: (gesturing, pointing)
dialog: I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna
dialog: die, the audience is gonna die, the

speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (nodding emphatically)
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (chewing and pointing
dialog: to Mickey)
dialog: Listen, kid, I think you snapped
dialog: your cap.
text: Mickey sighs.
speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: (continuing, chewing loudly)
dialog: Maybe you need a few weeks in
dialog: Bermuda, or something. Or go to a
dialog: whorehouse! No?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (shaking his head,
text: his hand to his chest)
dialog: I can't stay on this show. I gotta
dialog: get some answers. Otherwise
dialog: (pausing and holding
dialog: his head)
dialog: I'm telling you, I'm going to do
dialog: something drastic.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The entrance to the St. Regis Hotel, elegant and warmly lit
text: in the night. Pedestrians pass. Baroque harpsichord music
text: plays over the scene. The camera moves up the hotel's
text: façade, past its welcoming flags, to its ornate windows
text: several floors up.
text: As the harpsichord continues to play, the film moves inside,
text: to one of the hotel rooms. Elliot, his back to the camera,
text: is opening the door to Lee.
text: Elliot closes the door behind her as she enters. They stand
text: very close to each other, framed by the door and a stark,
text: subtly striped wallpapered wall.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (looking intensely at
text: Lee, his hands in his pockets)
dialog: I thought you weren't coming.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I almost didn't.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
text: (putting his hand on
text: her shoulder, wanting
dialog: to kiss her)
dialog: Lee... uh...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I didn't sleep all night.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
text: (taking his hand
text: away, gesturing to
dialog: the room)
dialog: No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
text: They walk towards the camera, further into the room. Elliot
text: puts his arm around Lee.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What are we doing, meeting in a
dialog: hotel room? It's terrible, isn't it?
text: The music stops. The camera follows Lee as she walks
text: towards the curtained windows, past a fireplace, a mirror,
text: some innocuous pictures, a delicate table holding a lamp,
text: the foot of the bed.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I-I couldn't think where to invite
dialog: you without taking risks.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I promised myself I wouldn't let
dialog: this happen till you were living
dialog: alone. I was so torn when you
dialog: called.
text: She parts a corner of the curtains, looking out the window,
text: turning when Elliot speaks.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I've wanted to call you everyday
dialog: since I first told you how I felt.
text: He walks over to Lee by the curtained windows.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: I resisted so many times.
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: Don't think badly of me.
text: He takes Lee into his arms.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: This is not an easy situation.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I know it isn't.
text: They kiss, their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow
text: of the room. Elliot takes Lee's coat off without breaking
text: the kiss. They embrace. They kiss each other lightly, then
text: stronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter.
text: And it's later that night. The harpsichord music begins to
text: play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal
text: Lee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out
text: on the pillows, one arm near her head.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: That was just perfect. You've
dialog: ruined me for anyone else.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I don't want anyone else ever to
dialog: have you.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: I was so worried I wouldn't compare
dialog: with Hannah.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen, laughing)
dialog: Oh, my God.
text: He enters the screen, sitting down on the edge of the bed
text: next to Lee. He holds a cigarette.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: You really do have those thoughts,
dialog: don't you?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (chuckling, touching
dialog: Elliot's arm)
dialog: Oh, all the time.
text: Elliot chuckles; they hold hands.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I know she must be a really
dialog: passionate person.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (looking at their
dialog: clasped hands)
dialog: Yes, she's, she's very warm, but,
dialog: but it-it's me that wants to be
dialog: giving to you. I-I-I want to do
dialog: things for you. Hannah doesn't
dialog: need me as much.
text: (chuckling as Lee laughs)
dialog: I'm being presumptuous. Not that
dialog: you need me.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: I want you to take care of me...
dialog: And I love when you do things to me.
text: Elliot leans down to Lee; they begin to kiss passionately.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE FREDERICK'S LOFT - NIGHT
text: Lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain; she's bareheaded.
text: The streets are dark. A car drives by; a pedestrian passes
text: holding an umbrella. Lee passes a restaurant well lit
text: inside by hanging lamps. The baroque music continues as she
text: enters the loft, her head soaked. She closes the door,
text: touching her soaking hair.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: You're late.
text: Lee walks through the loft's living room area, unbelting her
text: coat, towards the bathroom. She passes Frederick, who sits
text: at a table in the kitchen area, drinking a cup of coffee and
text: reading the paper. A plate with a half-eaten sandwich sits
text: in front of him. The music stops.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (opening the bathroom door)
dialog: Lucy and I kept talking, and I
dialog: didn't realize how late it had
dialog: gotten.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (barely glancing up
dialog: from his paper)
dialog: You missed a very dull TV show
text: about Auschwitz. More gruesome
dialog: film clips...and more puzzled
dialog: intellectuals declaring their
dialog: mystification over the systematic
dialog: murder of millions.
text: As he talks, Lee is seen turning on the bathroom light. She
text: takes off her coat, hanging it on a hook, then begins to dry
text: her hair with a towel.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
text: (turning his head
dialog: slightly in Lee's
dialog: direction and gesturing)
dialog: The reason why they could never
dialog: answer the question "How could it
dialog: possibly happen?" is that it's the
dialog: wrong question. Given what people
dialog: are, the question is
dialog: (swallowing)
dialog: "Why doesn't it happen more often?"
text: Of course it does, in subtler forms.
text: Frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and another sip of
text: coffee as Lee walks out of the bathroom, tossing the towel
text: down on the counter.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (moving her fingers
dialog: through her wet hair)
dialog: I have a little headache from this
dialog: weather.
text: She takes a kettle and fills it with water.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
text: (grunting, sipping
dialog: his coffee)
dialog: It's been ages since I sat in front
dialog: of the TV... just changing channels
dialog: to find something.
text: As Frederick continues his monologue, Lee is busy in the
text: background: striking a wooden match and lighting a burner on
text: the stove for the kettle, taking a glass out of the cupboard,
text: walking into the bathroom for some pills, filling the glass
text: with water in the kitchen sink, and taking her pills.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: You see the whole culture...Nazis,
dialog: deodorant salesman,
dialog: wrestlers...beauty contests, the
dialog: talk show... Can you imagine the
dialog: level of a mind that watches
dialog: wrestling?
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Hmm? But the worst are the
dialog: fundamentalist preachers...third-
dialog: rate con men, telling the poor
dialog: suckers that watch them that they
dialog: speak for Jesus...and to please
dialog: send in money.
dialog: (picking up his sandwich)
dialog: Money, money, money! If Jesus came
dialog: back, and saw what's going on in
dialog: his name, he'd never stop throwing
dialog: up.
text: He takes a bite of his sandwich and a sip of coffee. Lee
text: sets her glass on the kitchen counter and walks towards the
dialog: bedroom area.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (impatiently, her
dialog: hands in her hair)
dialog: Oh, God, Frederick, could you
dialog: please lighten up?! I'm really not
text: in the mood to hear a review of
dialog: contemporary society again.
text: She starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed. Frederick
text: takes off his glasses. He turns and looks at Lee in surprise.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (standing up from the table)
dialog: You know, you've been very nervous
dialog: lately.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: I can't take this anymore.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (walking over to the bed)
dialog: I'm just trying to complete an
dialog: education I started on you five
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (unbuttoning her blouse)
dialog: I'm not your pupil.
text: (sighing, her hands
dialog: at her side)
dialog: I was, but I'm not.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (sitting down on the
dialog: edge of the bed)
dialog: When you leave the nest, I just
dialog: want you to be ready to face the
dialog: real world.
text: He pulls Lee down next to him on the bed.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (putting her hand on
dialog: Frederick's leg)
dialog: Frederick, we're going to have to
dialog: make some changes.
text: She sighs.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
text: (quickly looking at
dialog: Lee, alarmed)
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating!
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (turning away, his
text: hands clasped in
dialog: front of him)
dialog: Oh! Are we going to have this
dialog: conversation again?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yes, we're going to have this
dialog: conversation again. I...I have to
dialog: leave. I have to move out.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (shaking his clasped
dialog: hands intensely)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Because I have to!
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (emotionally)
dialog: What are you going to use for money?!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd
dialog: move in with my parents for a while.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: Tch, oh. I always told you you
dialog: would leave me.
dialog: (looking at Lee)
dialog: But...does it have to be now?
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (hugging her arm with
dialog: her other hand)
dialog: Well, maybe it'll only be temporary,
dialog: but I ha--I have to try.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (taking Lee's head in
text: his hands and looking
dialog: at her)
dialog: Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: Good God! Have you been kissed
dialog: tonight?!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (reacting, pushing
dialog: Frederick's hands
dialog: from her face)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Oh, yes, you have!
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (quickly standing up, defensively)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (raising his voice)
dialog: You've been with someone!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping, running
dialog: away from the bed)
dialog: Stop accusing me!
text: Lee runs into the kitchen, her hands tight around her chest.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I'm too smart, Lee! You can't fool
dialog: me! You're turning all red!
text: Lee, fraught with emotion, briefly puts her outstretched
text: hands on the refrigerator door, then turns around and leans
text: against it, hugging herself, her blouse still unbuttoned,
text: her hair still wet and bedraggled.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Leave me alone!
text: Frederick enters the kitchen area and leans against the
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (leaning against the
text: refrigerator, sighing)
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: Oh, couldn't you say something?
dialog: You have to slither around behind
dialog: my back!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping, her
dialog: voice emotionally raised)
dialog: I'm saying it now!
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: So you met somebody else?
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (sighing, nodding)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Frederick cringes, reacting. He puts his hand to his
text: forehead; he sighs.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (walking into the bathroom)
dialog: But you, God, you knew that was
dialog: going to happen sooner or later. I
dialog: can't live like this!
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: (turning to face Lee
text: in the bathroom, his
dialog: arms crossed)
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (frantically putting
text: things in her purse,
dialog: glaring at Frederick)
dialog: What's the difference?! It's just
dialog: somebody I met!
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: But who? Where did you meet him?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It doesn't make a difference! I
dialog: have to move out!
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: You are, you are my only connection
dialog: to the world!
text: Lee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (gesturing emotionally)
dialog: Oh, God, that's too much
dialog: responsibility for me. It's not
dialog: fair! I want a less complicated
dialog: life, Frederick. I want a husband,
dialog: maybe even a child before it's too
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
text: (reacting, his face
dialog: in his hand)
dialog: Jesus...Jesus!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (gesturing, moving
dialog: closer to Frederick)
dialog: Oh, God, I don't even know what I
dialog: want.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
text: (sighing heavily, reacting)
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (rubbing Frederick's
dialog: shoulder tenderly)
dialog: Tch, oh, what do you get out of me,
dialog: anyway? I mean...
text: (laying her head
text: against his shoulder,
dialog: sighing deeply)
dialog: it's not sexual anymore. It's
dialog: certainly not intellectual. I
dialog: mean, you're so superior to me in
dialog: every way that--
text: Frederick furiously shakes Lee away. He pounds his fist
text: against a cupboard. Lee, gasping, moves away.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: Please, don't patronize me!
text: He puts his hand on his forehead, then turns to the offscreen
dialog: Lee.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: God! I should have married you
dialog: years ago when you wanted to! I
dialog: should have agreed.
text: He walks over to Lee in another area of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Oh, God, don't you know it never
dialog: would have worked?
text: Frederick turns away from Lee. He begins to pace near the
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: FREDERICK
dialog: I told you, one day you would leave
dialog: me...
dialog: (leaning on the counter)
dialog: for a younger man. I--
text: He loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and
text: frustration, then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Hannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book
text: propped up on her knees. A cupboard with some bric-a-brac
text: is mounted behind the night table, which holds a small,
text: white, warm-glowing lamp and some photographs. She turns
text: the page as Elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters.
text: She continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge
text: of the bed and muses. His voice is heard over the screen.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: What passion today with Lee. She's
dialog: a volcano. It was a totally
dialog: fulfilling experience... Just as I
dialog: dreamed it would be.
dialog: (nodding slightly as
text: he takes off his slippers)
dialog: That's what it was. It was like
dialog: living out a dream...a great dream.
dialog: (taking off his bathrobe)
dialog: Now I feel very good and cozy being
dialog: here next to Hannah. There's
dialog: something very lovely and real
dialog: about Hannah.
dialog: (tossing his bathrobe
text: aside and lying down
text: on the bed next to
text: Hannah, his hands
text: crossed over his stomach)
dialog: She gives me a very deep feeling of
dialog: being part of something. She's a
dialog: wonderful woman...and I betrayed
dialog: her. She came into my empty life
dialog: and changed it...and I paid her
text: back by banging her sister in a
dialog: hotel room. God, I'm despicable.
dialog: What a cruel and shallow thing to
dialog: do.
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: I have to call her now and tell her
dialog: what we did was crazy.
dialog: (anxiously)
dialog: It can't ever happen again. I'm
dialog: not that kind of man...and I value
dialog: Hannah too much. I love my wife.
dialog: Now I've betrayed her. Oh, God!
text: Elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (reading, not looking up)
dialog: Where're you going?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a
dialog: phone number in my desk. I forgot
dialog: to phone Mel Kaufman.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (still reading)
dialog: It's so late.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Yeah, I know. I-I can't believe I
dialog: forgot.
text: Elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: What if he answers?
dialog: (turning into the
dialog: doorway leading to
dialog: the living room)
dialog: I'll hang up.
dialog: (walking into the
dialog: darkened living room)
dialog: I'll tell her we can't communicate
dialog: until I terminate my marriage.
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: It's immoral.
text: Elliot switches on the light. He paces back and forth in
text: front of the piano and an accompanying music stand. The top
text: of the piano is filled with family photos; the lamp he
text: turned on illuminates some framed pictures on the wall and
text: the piece of sheet music open on the piano.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (gesturing and whispering)
dialog: Then, time will pass. I won't
dialog: call, and she'll get the idea. I
dialog: gotta stop this before I get in too
dialog: deep. I'd rather hurt Lee a
dialog: little, than destroy Hannah.
text: Elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (whispering, rubbing
dialog: his hands)
dialog: It's one-thirty. She...she can't
dialog: have a conversation with me...with
text: him around. I'm getting hysterical.
text: (putting his hands on
dialog: his hips)
dialog: I'll call her first thing in the
dialog: morning. I'll call her at six.
dialog: (pointing)
text: Frederick goes jogging at six,
dialog: yeah, she'll be alone. And I'll,
dialog: I'll call her and nip it in the bud.
text: The phone rings. Elliot jumps.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (loudly, to the
dialog: offscreen Hannah, gasping)
dialog: I've got it! I've got it! I've
dialog: got it!
dialog: (picking up the
dialog: phone, into the telephone)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (loudly, for the
dialog: offscreen Hannah's benefit)
dialog: Mel!
text: The movie cuts to Lee, standing in the dark in Frederick's
text: loft. She talks softly into the telephone.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (into the telephone)
dialog: I would have hung up if you hadn't
dialog: answered and I promise I won't ever
dialog: do this again, but I just had to
dialog: tell you, I feel very close to you
dialog: tonight. Very, very close.
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: Good night.
text: Lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot,
text: standing in his living room. Stunned, he slowly lowers the
text: phone receiver.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: "The only absolute knowledge attainable by man is that life
dialog: is meaningless." - Tolstoy
text: Jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a
text: university library, the camera focused on a huge replica of
text: Rodin's Thinker before moving to the front entrance. Mickey
text: can be seen emerging from its depths. He wears his raincoat,
text: his hands are in his pockets. He ponders the scene as he
text: walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the
text: sidewalk. Passersby, some holding books, are seen.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Millions of books written on every
dialog: conceivable subject by all these
dialog: great minds, and, and in the end,
dialog: none of 'em knows anything more
dialog: about the big questions of life
dialog: than I do. Ss--I read Socrates.
dialog: You know, n-n-n--, this guy used to
dialog: kn-knock off little Greek boys.
dialog: What the hell's he got to teach me?
dialog: And, and Nietzsche with his, with
dialog: his Theory of Eternal Recurrence.
dialog: He said that the life we live,
dialog: we're gonna live over and over
dialog: again the exact same way for
dialog: eternity. Great. That means I,
dialog: uh, I'll have to sit through the
dialog: Ice Capades again. Tch. It's not
dialog: worth it.
text: The movie next cuts to a sunny day in Central Park. A male
text: jogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by. The
text: camera moves past him, revealing a pondering Mickey walking
text: by the reservoir. He continues to talk over the screen.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: And, and Freud, another great
dialog: pessimist. Jeez, I was in analysis
dialog: for years. Nothing happened. My
dialog: poor analyst got so frustrated.
text: The guy finally put in a salad bar.
text: Several joggers pass Mickey; he continues to ruminate.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Oh! Look at all these people
text: jogging...trying to stave off the
text: inevitable decay of the body. Boy
dialog: (smacking his lips)
dialog: it's so sad what people go through
dialog: with their-their stationary bike
dialog: and their exercise and their...
text: (glancing at a fat
text: woman jogger in a red
dialog: sweatsuit who runs by)
dialog: ...Oh! Look at this one! Poor
dialog: thing. My God, she has to tote all
dialog: that fat around. Maybe the poets
dialog: are right. Maybe love is the only
dialog: answer.
text: Mickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the
text: reservoir. He stops walking and looks out over the water.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Shh--Of course, I was in love with
dialog: Hannah. That didn't work out too
dialog: well.
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: I even took her sister out.
dialog: Remember that?
text: Mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and
text: the distant skyline. A jogger crosses in front of him.
text: It's very quiet; the soft jazz continues.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Remember years ago when Hannah and
dialog: I got divorced and she fixed me up
dialog: with her sister Holly?
text: The film cuts abruptly to Mickey's flashback of his date
text: with Holly, beginning with a rock club performance. The
text: soft jazz becomes loud, pulsating rock. Three punkers--a
text: girl with pink hair, a girl with a spiked mohawk, and a guy
text: with Stevie Wonder braids and sunglasses--watch and bop
text: their heads to the sounds of the offscreen rock band, The 39
dialog: Steps.
text: The camera moves to the stage, revealing a sleazy-looking
text: rock band in the midst of their number.
speaker_heading: THE 39 STEPS
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "I want to be like you
dialog: I said I'm going to fit into your
dialog: group..."
text: As the band loudly plays on, the camera moves across the
text: spellbound audience, sitting at crowded, smoky, small
text: tables, to reveal a stricken Mickey and a mesmerized Holly
text: squeezed together at one of them. A nearby member of the
text: audience swills beer from a bottle. Holly, beating time to
text: the music and enjoying herself, takes a puff of her cigarette.
text: She wears a wristful of silver bracelets. She glances at
text: Mickey impatiently. He's the only one in the place wearing
text: a suit.
speaker_heading: THE 39 STEPS
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "I don't wanna be different
dialog: Said I'm gonna be just like you
dialog: Because I'm gonna buy the records
dialog: That they play on radio...
text: Holly turns back to the band, who are still in full swing.
text: The camera moves down the body of the lead singer, singing
text: into a microphone, from his longish, curly red hair, through
text: his cut-off red shirt and sweaty torso, to his guitar. He
text: wears several silver bracelets on his wrists and gold
text: bracelets on his upper arm. The microphone screeches
dialog: feedback.
speaker_heading: THE 39 STEPS
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "I'm gonna dance at clubs
dialog: Gonna do just what I'm told

dialog: And I'm bleedin' now
dialog: I wanna slip, slip, slip, slip,
dialog: slip
dialog: Into the crowd
dialog: I wanna slip, slip, slip, slip,
dialog: slip
dialog: Into the crowd..."
text: The camera moves back to Holly and the even more stricken-
text: looking Mickey. They are crowded in with people. In the
text: background, a waitress holds up a tray. A man drinks from a
text: glass mug; people chatter indistinctly over the loud band.
text: The club is noisy, smoky, and thick with people. Holly
text: glances at Mickey once again, this time unable to contain
text: her annoyance.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh, why are you making those faces?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (leaning over to
dialog: Holly, gesturing)
dialog: I can't hear you. I can't hear

speaker_heading: HOLLY

dialog: Look, can't you feel the energy?
text: It's tangible energy! The room's

dialog: Holly's shoulder)
dialog: don't, please.
text: While Mickey pleads with her, Holly puts her cocaine vial

dialog: to smoke.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Can we, can we go?
speaker_heading: HOLLY

speaker_heading: THE 39 STEPS
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "...Gonna buy the records
dialog: That they play on the radio..."
text: ...as the film cuts abruptly to outside the rock club. The

speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (enthusiastically)
dialog: I love songs about extraterrestrial
dialog: life, don't you?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Not when they're sung by

speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (impatiently, with annoyance)
dialog: Oh, well, I cannot communicate with
dialog: you! I, you know, I never realized
dialog: you were such a tightass.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I can't understand you. Your

speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Do you mind? I'm-I'm my own person.
speaker_heading: MICKEY

speaker_heading: HOLLY

dialog: Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Now come on, you're be--, 'cause

text: They stop briefly at a street corner and look for oncoming

text: across the street towards the camera.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: I'm not angry! You know, you,

speaker_heading: MICKEY

speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, it was quite an evening.
dialog: Holly with her cocaine...
dialog: (chuckling)
text: She should have been wearing a gold

text: Both a bus and a taxi drive down the street, blocking Mickey

text: A big-band rendition of "You Made Me Love You" begins as the

text: dancing cheek to cheek in the reflection of a mirror over a

text: the dresser; on the other side is a bucket with champagne.
text: Two half-full glasses sit nearby. Elliot and Lee dance into

speaker_heading: ELLIOT

speaker_heading: ELLIOT

dialog: Well, I-I don't think it's a very

speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT

speaker_heading: HANNAH

dialog: How settled can things get?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT

dialog: Connecticut. I-it's all
dialog: very...preconceived.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you

speaker_heading: ELLIOT

speaker_heading: ASSISTANT #1
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: Terrific.
text: The camera has reached the executives in the audience. They
text: are now chattering among themselves, Holly forgotten.
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: (offscreen,
dialog: overlapping the
dialog: executives' chatter)
dialog: April Knox?
text: The film cuts back to the stage, where April, handling the
text: audition pianist some sheet music, prepares herself to sing
text: "The Way You Look Tonight." The stage is very black, stark,
text: except for April and the pianist.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "Someday
dialog: When I'm awfully low
dialog: When the world is cold
dialog: I will get a glow
dialog: Just thinking of you
dialog: And the way you look
dialog: Tonight..."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A STREET OUTSIDE THE THEATER - DAY
text: A theater marquee can be seen on the busy street as Holly
text: and April walk down the street towards the camera, moving
text: closer and closer as they talk. Workmen and various street
text: noises can be heard indistinctly in the background.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I'm telling you, you sounded great.
dialog: You, uh, you may be surprised.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering
dialog: job this week. I'm real low on
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's
dialog: eightieth birthday party on
dialog: Riverside Drive...or Riverside
dialog: Memorial Chapel, depending on his
dialog: health.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Uh, David called me last night, and
dialog: he wants to take me to the opera.
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: I didn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: No, he called late last night.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: I, uh, I'm very surprised.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (chuckling, gesturing)
dialog: He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (looking briefly at April)
dialog: And you, you-you're going?
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say.
dialog: First I said no, but then, he
dialog: pressed it. He said, uh, he'd
dialog: taken you once and he really wanted
dialog: to invite me.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: But I'm seeing him.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I know. I said that, but...
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: he said it was something he really
dialog: felt like doing.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (stopping and facing April)
dialog: Gee, um...
text: (looking off, sniffing)
dialog: I...I don't know what to say.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: Look, it's just an evening at the
dialog: opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in
dialog: accepting?
text: Holly looks away sadly; she shakes her head.
speaker_heading: APRIL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: The big leap.
text: The film cuts to Father Flynn's rectory office. The Catholic
text: priest looks out a simple stained-glass window, then turns
text: to an offscreen Mickey.
speaker_heading: FATHER FLYNN
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Now why do you think that you would
dialog: like to convert to Catholicism?
text: The camera moves back to reveal Mickey, his back to the
text: camera, sitting in front of Father Flynn's desk. A lamp is
text: lit in the background; the Father's desk is neat. The room
text: is comfortably decorated in wood and leather.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Well, uh, because, y-you know, I
dialog: gotta have something to believe in,
dialog: otherwise life is just meaningless.
speaker_heading: FATHER FLYNN
dialog: (pacing behind his
dialog: desk and gesturing)
dialog: I understand. But why did you make
dialog: the decision to choose the Catholic
dialog: faith?
text: The movie cuts to Mickey's face. He's very neat in a tie,
text: sweater, and sports jacket.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Tch. Well, y-you know...first of
dialog: all, because it's a very beautiful
dialog: religion. It's very well structured.
dialog: Now I'm talking now, incidentally,
dialog: about the-the, uh, against-school-
dialog: prayer, pro-abortion, anti-nuclear
dialog: wing.
speaker_heading: FATHER FLYNN
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: So at the moment you don't believe
dialog: in God.
text: The camera cuts back to Father Flynn, who walks over to a
text: leather armchair next to a table set for tea. He begins to
text: pour the tea into china cups.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: No. A-a-and I-I want to. You
dialog: know, I'm-I'm willing to do anything.
dialog: I'll, you know, I'll dye Easter
dialog: eggs if it works.
dialog: (walking over to
dialog: Father Flynn and
text: sitting down in an
dialog: adjacent chair)
dialog: I-I need some evidence. I gotta
dialog: have some proof. Uh, you know, i-
dialog: i-if I can't believe in God
dialog: (gesturing, his
text: raincoat in his lap)
dialog: then I don't think life is worth
dialog: living.
speaker_heading: FATHER FLYNN
dialog: (stopping his tea pouring)
dialog: It means making a very big leap.
text: Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (nodding, fiddling
dialog: with his raincoat)
dialog: Yes, well, can-can you help me?
text: The film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in Mickey's
text: parents' apartment.
text: In the foreground, a section of the living room can be seen,
text: with a bureau holding a lamp and a framed photo. The
text: hallway itself is crowded with pictures and a wall shelf.
text: At the other end of the hallway, in the background, is
text: another bureau, with candlesticks on top and a framed
text: picture on the wall above. Mickey's mother stands in the
text: front of this bureau at the hallway's end, screaming at the
text: top of her lungs, holding her heart dramatically.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Why? Oh, my God!
text: She sobs hysterically, staggering offscreen to the bathroom;
text: she shuts the door. Mickey walks into view, in the living
text: room, looking after his shocked mother, who continues to cry
text: over the scene.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping and gesturing)
dialog: I don't understand.
dialog: (turning to his
dialog: offscreen father)
dialog: I thought that you would be happy.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: How can we be happy?
text: His father walks into view, carrying a teacup and a candy
text: dish. He strides past Mickey towards the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (following his father)
dialog: Well, because I never thought of
dialog: God in my life. Now I'm giving it
text: serious thought.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (offscreen, in the kitchen)
dialog: But Catholicism? Why not your own
dialog: people?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing at the
text: kitchen door to his
dialog: offscreen father)
dialog: Because I got off to a wrong foot
dialog: with my own thing, you know. B-b-
dialog: b-but I need a dramatic change in
dialog: my life.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I know it sounds funny, but I'm
dialog: gonna try.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: But why? We raised you as a Jew.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: So, just 'cause I was born that
dialog: way... You know, I'm old enough to
dialog: make a mature decision.
text: Mickey's father walks into view; he stands by the stove near
text: the kitchen doorway, picking up a dirty glass and some bowls
dialog: to clean.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: But why Jesus Christ? Why, for
dialog: instance, shouldn't you become a
dialog: Buddhist?
text: Holding the dirty dishes in his hand, Mickey's father looks
text: at his son.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: A Bud--? That's totally alien to
dialog: me. Look, you're getting on in
dialog: years, right? Aren't you afraid of
dialog: dying?
text: Mickey's father walks offscreen again, to the kitchen sink.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Why should I be afraid?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (loudly gesturing)
dialog: Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: That thought doesn't terrify you?
text: Mickey's father walks out of the kitchen, past his son, to
text: the living room.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (waving his arm)
dialog: Who thinks about such nonsense?
dialog: Now I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'll
dialog: be dead.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (following his
dialog: father, gesturing)
dialog: I don't understand. Aren't you
dialog: frightened?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Of what? I'll be unconscious.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (turning and walking
dialog: down the hallway)
dialog: Yeah, I know. But never to exist
dialog: again!
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Well, it certainly doesn't look
dialog: promising.
text: Mickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the
text: hallway. He starts to pound it.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Who knows what'll be?
text: Mickey's father comes back on screen; he's carrying a plate
text: of hors d'oeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen.
text: He stops and looks down the hall at Mickey, who's now
text: struggling to open the bathroom door.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (gesturing with his
dialog: hands full)
dialog: I'll either be unconscious or I
dialog: won't. If not, I'll deal with it
dialog: then. I'm not gonna worry now
dialog: about what's gonna be when I'm
text: unconscious.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (pounding on the door)
dialog: Mom, come out!
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (offscreen in the bathroom)
dialog: Of course there's a God, you idiot!
dialog: You don't believe in God?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: But if there's a God, then wh-why
dialog: is there so much evil in the world?
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: What-- Just on a simplistic level.
dialog: Why-why were there Nazis?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (offscreen in the bathroom)
dialog: Tell him, Max.
text: Mickey, reacting, hits his forehead.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: How the hell do I know why there
dialog: were Nazis? I don't know how the
text: can opener works.
text: Mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to:
text: A beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with
text: courtyard and wrought-iron fence. A pedestrian walks by
text: with an umbrella. A church choir sings a soaring hymn over
text: the scene.
text: The music continues as the film moves inside, where the
text: choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold. A
text: fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film
text: cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands
text: underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening
text: to the inspiring music.
text: The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father
text: Flynn in his office.
text: He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his
text: window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his
text: desk, already holding several tomes. Father Flynn puts the
text: books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the
text: top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door.
text: Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the
text: cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression.
text: His eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit
text: them, open and close repeatedly. The hymn plays on, loudly,
text: as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside
text: a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and
text: shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect.
text: Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking
text: Christ. A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby;
text: passing traffic is reflected in the window.
text: Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk
text: down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open-
text: air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving
text: pedestrians.
text: With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly.
text: Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating
text: him. He's just entered his apartment. He closes the door
text: and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag.
text: He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral
text: staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he
text: makes his way to his living room coffee table. Mickey pulls
text: a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on
text: the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art. He
text: then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on
text: top of the crucifix. Then out comes a framed picture of a
text: saint. It too gets put on the growing pile. But the bag is
text: not yet empty. Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and
text: a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise. Mickey sets them on
text: top of the saint.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY
text: Lee is walking down the street, looking around her. The
text: sidewalk is fairly crowded with people; the sounds of
text: traffic are heard. She passes some office buildings, a
text: store's large display window; she stops when she sees Hannah.
text: Her sister is waiting outside the Art Deco façade of a
text: restaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction. Lee
text: taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and
text: gasps.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping Hannah's gasp)
dialog: Hi.
text: The sisters laugh and embrace each other.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Hi. Where's Holly?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Hi. She's auditioning for a
dialog: television commercial. She said
dialog: she's gonna be a little late.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Oh, yeah? How's she doing?
text: She turns and walks towards the restaurant entrance.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (following Hannah
dialog: through the
dialog: restaurant's doors)
dialog: Oh, God, you know Holly. When
dialog: she's depressed, she's manic. I
dialog: think it was a good idea that we
dialog: invited her to lunch.
text: They disappear inside. The camera follows them, cutting to
text: the restaurant's interior at the same time the sisters walk
text: in. It's a chic, trendy place, with an Art Deco design and
text: high ceilings. A waiter in uniform stands near its glass
text: and metal doors, holding a tray to his chest; a few people
text: sit at the bar; a large plant in a vase sits in the
text: foreground. The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area,
text: deep in conversation.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (pulling off her
text: scarf, still on the
dialog: subject of Holly)
dialog: I hope you tell her it was your
dialog: idea...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ...'cause every time I try to be
dialog: helpful, you know, sh-she gets so
dialog: defensive.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (unbuttoning her coat)
dialog: Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just
dialog: embarrassed in front of you, that's
dialog: all.
text: Hannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room.
text: She talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and
text: speaking as well. In the background, a waiter crosses over
text: to the bar, then walks away.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: So how are you?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Oh, me, I'm okay.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Do you miss Frederick?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I can't believe Elliot and I can't
dialog: think of someone nice for you to go
dialog: out with, you know--
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (interrupting, her
dialog: voice slightly
text: higher-pitched as she
dialog: takes off her coat)
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: You know, how's everything? You
dialog: doing okay? How's Frederick?
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I mean, Elliot.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: Y-yeah.
text: Hannah walks out of the coatcheck room without her coat;
text: it's Lee's turn to disappear and check her things. Now only
text: Hannah can be seen onscreen as the sisters talk. In the
text: background, the waiter once again walks over to the bar.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh, he's fine. He's-he's, I guess
dialog: he's fine. I don't know.
dialog: (shaking her head,
dialog: her arms crossed)
dialog: He's been kinda moody lately, the
dialog: last few months.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong
dialog: with him. He's just...kind of
text: distant and difficult.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
dialog: I've been trying to talk to him
dialog: about it. He says everything's
dialog: fine, but I don't know.
dialog: Automatically, you know, I leap to
dialog: the worst conclusions.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Like what?
text: As Hannah answers her sister, Holly can be seen entering the
text: restaurant and walking over to the coatcheck area, an unlit
text: cigarette in her mouth, her sunglasses still on her eyes.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I mean, I don't know, he's seeing
dialog: someone else or something, but...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (walking back onscreen
text: without her coat, reacting)
dialog: Oh, no! I mean, everyone thinks
dialog: things like that.
text: Hannah mumbles indistinctly as Holly walks over to her
dialog: sisters.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (turning, to Holly)
dialog: Hey, hi!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Well, I just came from an audition...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping, leaning
dialog: against the coatcheck wall)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...which I did not get.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Awwww...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, sighing)
dialog: So what's new?
text: She takes off her gloves and scarf, stuffing them in her bag)
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (helping Holly with
dialog: her coat)
dialog: Boy--
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: They said I was too offbeat looking,
dialog: whatever the hell that means.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Oh, what do they know?
text: Holly gives her coat to the coatcheck person.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (to the checker)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (turning to her sisters)
dialog: But guess who was there auditioning?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: April?
text: The hostess appears, peeking around the corner of the
text: coatcheck area. She signals for the three sisters to follow
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (reacting to Holly's news)
dialog: Oh, gosh.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You got it.
text: Holly takes off her sunglasses; her cigarette still dangles
text: from her mouth. Hannah murmurs her sympathy as the trio
text: follows the hostess into the dining room.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I was very polite. I maintained my
dialog: poise.
dialog: (taking out a match
dialog: for her cigarette)
dialog: I said hello.
text: The sisters walk to their seats, at a round table in the
text: middle of the room; the hostess puts down their menus.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Hmm. I never trusted April, you
text: know. She has eyes in the back of
text: her head.
text: They sit down. The hostess leaves. Other diners are seen
text: in the background; a waiter is taking the order of a couple
text: sitting on a banquette; other waiters clear off a table.
text: Diners walk in and out. A low murmur of conversation, as
text: well as the faint clatter of dishes, is heard. The camera
text: moves closer to the three sisters, circling the table as
text: Holly speaks.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Yeah, well, she and an architect
dialog: are now a very definite item, which
dialog: I still cannot believe.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Hmm.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Oh, God...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding her head,
dialog: holding her cigarette)
dialog: Yeah, although it's put an end to
dialog: the Stanislavski Catering Company.
dialog: Which is why I have to speak to you.
dialog: And...
dialog: (gesturing to Hannah)
dialog: you're gonna get impatient, but...I
dialog: have to borrow some more money.
dialog: (putting her cigarette
text: in her mouth and
dialog: picking up the matches)
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Well, that...th-that's fine.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing, her
dialog: cigarette in one
dialog: hand, her matches in
dialog: the other)
dialog: But what I decided to do is some
dialog: writing. Yeah, I think I've had it
dialog: with acting. You know, these
dialog: meaningless auditions at cattle
dialog: calls. And I can't handle another
dialog: rejection.
dialog: (emotionally)
dialog: Now let's face it here. I gotta,
dialog: you know, latch on to something in
dialog: my life. You know--something with
dialog: a future. I'm not sixteen anymore.
dialog: (lighting her cigarette)
dialog: It's just...crazy!
dialog: (puffing her cigarette)
dialog: I've got...an idea for a story.
dialog: More than one. And I just need a
dialog: few months, you know, or, uh, a
dialog: year even.
text: As the camera slowly circles the table, Hannah is seen
text: listening to Holly, her hand on her mouth.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I've picked up a lot about dramatic
dialog: structure from doing my scenes in
dialog: acting class.
text: Lee, her hand on her mouth, glances briefly at Hannah. As
text: Hannah replies to Holly, the camera focuses on Lee's face.
text: She bites her nails; she looks down, involved in her own
dialog: thoughts.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Well, that-that's good. It just,
dialog: uh...it just seems to me that-that
dialog: six months or a year, if-if you
dialog: spent it more productively...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen, the
text: camera still focused
dialog: on Lee)
dialog: Well-well, like what?
text: Lee looks up, her hand still on her mouth, watching Hannah,
text: as the camera slowly moves off her to show Hannah.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Well, I don't know. We'd uh, uh,
dialog: um... Didn't Mom mention there was
dialog: something...something at the Museum
dialog: of Broadcasting?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Yeah, that's clerical.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: No. She, didn't she say it was,
dialog: um...she said it was in the
dialog: publicity department. That-that
dialog: can lead to other things.
text: The camera is back on Lee. She looks around tensely, barely
text: listening to the conversation. She fidgets. An empty table
text: sits in the background.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I'm not! I'm not! I'm trying to
dialog: be helpful. A person doesn't just
dialog: say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm
dialog: finished as an actress. Now I'm a
dialog: writer." I mean--
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen, interrupting)
dialog: Yeah, you mean not at my age.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (shaking her head,
dialog: unable to take much more)
dialog: Oh, please! We all came to have
dialog: lunch, didn't we?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (reacting, now in view)
dialog: Yeah, okay, right. Forget it.
dialog: (puffing on her cigarette)
dialog: What's to eat?
text: Holly abruptly picks up her menu.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (trying to alleviate
dialog: the tension)
dialog: Boy...Holly...Holly.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I just want a salad.
dialog: (to Hannah)
dialog: You really think I'm a loser, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: What do--? You're being ridiculous.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping, reacting)
dialog: You are, Holly. Stop it.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (to Hannah)
dialog: You treat me like a loser.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You never have any faith in my
dialog: plans. You always undercut my
dialog: enthusiasm.
text: She puffs intensely on her cigarette as the camera slowly
text: circles to Hannah's face. She is equally intense, looking
text: at both sisters as she speaks.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: Not so! No. I think I've been
dialog: very supportive. I've...I try to
dialog: give you honest, constructive advice.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Hmm!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I'm-I'm always happy to help you
dialog: financially. I think I've gone out
dialog: of my way to-to introduce you to
dialog: interesting single men. There's
dialog: nothing I would--
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen, interrupting)
dialog: Uh, losers! All losers!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: You're too demanding.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: You know, I could always tell what
dialog: you thought of me by the type of
dialog: men you fixed me up with!
text: The camera, slowly circling the table, is back on Lee's face.
text: While her sisters argue emotionally on her right and left,
text: she is looking down, biting her lip. She is outwardly
text: still, but her face is registering her seething emotions.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: You're crazy! That's not true.

speaker_heading: LEE
text: (interrupting angrily,
text: looking as if she's
dialog: about to cry)
dialog: Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: Oh, now--
dialog: (stuttering)
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (interrupting,
dialog: shaking her head)
dialog: She's going through a really rough
dialog: time right now.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Why are you so upset?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (sobbing and gesturing)
dialog: You know, you've been picking on
dialog: her ever since she came in here.
dialog: Now just leave her alone for a
dialog: while! I'm just suffocating.
dialog: (sniffing back her tears)
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (leaning over to Lee,
text: puzzled, reacting to
dialog: her sister's tears)
dialog: What's the matter with you, Lee?
dialog: Why are you so sensitive all of a
dialog: sudden?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Look.
dialog: (onscreen, as the
text: camera circles around
dialog: the table)
dialog: Listen. Listen.
dialog: (tapping Holly on her
dialog: shoulder and gesturing)
dialog: You want to write? Write.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen,
dialog: overlapping to Lee)
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (flinging her hands)
dialog: Write! Let's just not talk about
dialog: it anymore.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Take...take a year. Take six
dialog: months. Whatever you want. Who
dialog: knows? Maybe you'll, maybe you'll
dialog: be sitting with a good play.
text: She opens her menu, then turns to Lee, reacting suddenly to
text: her sister, who is rubbing her forehead, looking terribly
text: upset.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (to Lee)
dialog: What's the matter? What's the
dialog: matter with you?
dialog: (offscreen again as
dialog: the camera circles
dialog: back to Lee)
dialog: You look pale. You okay?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping, nodding
dialog: and stuttering)
dialog: I'm-I'm okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you
dialog: know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy
dialog: all of a sudden. I'm-I'm...I have
dialog: a headache.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (still rubbing her
text: forehead, looking
dialog: down at the menu)
dialog: I think we need to eat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: Summer in New York.
text: A piano plays "Bewitched" in the background as the film cuts
text: to a large tree, covered with bright white blossoms. The
text: camera moves down the tree to reveal a well-kept, red-brick
text: brownstone on a pleasant, sunny New York City street. A man
text: wearing a summer suit walks by as the film moves inside the
text: building, to Elliot's analyst's office. The psychotherapist
text: sits in a comfortable armchair next to a curtained window.
text: In front of the window sits a table covered with artifacts
text: and a large lamp. The analyst's fingers are touching, his
text: arms resting on the chair, as he listens to the offscreen
dialog: Elliot.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I-I can't seem to take action.
dialog: I'm-I'm like, uh, Hamlet unable to
dialog: kill his uncle.
text: The music stops as the camera moves across the room to
text: reveal Elliot, sitting in a wooden chair. He holds a long,
text: thin cigarette; he wears a gold Rolex watch. He face is not
dialog: yet seen.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (face offscreen)
dialog: I want Lee, but I can't harm Hannah.
dialog: And in no other area am I a
text: procrastinator.
text: Elliot raises his cigarette to take a drag. The camera
text: follows the cigarette up to his face. Elliot looks
dialog: thoughtful as the movie cuts to:
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY
text: Lee, wearing jeans and carrying an armful of books, is
text: running up a broad set of steps in the sunlight, greeting
text: other students as she passes. Elliot continues to talk over
dialog: the scene...
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
text: Meanwhile...Lee has no direction.
text: She's taking courses at
text: Columbia...but just randomly.
text: ...as Lee stops on a portico and turns to greet Doug, a
text: professor, who is running over to her, calling her name.
text: They mouth hello, smiling, and begin to walk off together.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: I try not to call her, but then she
dialog: calls me and then...I call and...we
dialog: try to resist meeting, but...once
dialog: in a while we meet. Sometimes we
dialog: argue because I can't break up my
dialog: marriage. Sometimes we wind up
dialog: making love and...we both feel
dialog: terrible.
text: The film cuts back to Elliot in his analyst's office.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: But it's my fault.
text: Elliot takes a last drag on his cigarette. The camera
text: follows his hand as he crushes it out in a nearby ashtray.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (face offscreen)
dialog: For all my education,
dialog: accomplishments, and so-called
dialog: wisdom...I can't fathom my own heart.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
text: Hare Krishna music is heard over a sunlit view of the
text: Manhattan skyline and the green trees of Central Park. The
text: camera moves down to reveal a large group of Hare Krishnas
text: dancing on the broad green lawn among other New Yorkers
text: enjoying the day. The leader, holding some pamphlets,
text: stands by a chain-link fence, a few feet away from his
text: group, talking to someone on the other side. It's Mickey,
text: as the camera soon shows, wearing a short-sleeved shirt, a
text: paper tucked under his arm.
speaker_heading: KRISHNA LEADER
dialog: What makes you interested in
dialog: becoming a Hare Krishna?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: (gesturing, walking onscreen)
dialog: Well, I'm not saying that I want to
dialog: join or anything, but...but I know
dialog: you guys believe in reincarnation,
dialog: you know, so it interests me.
speaker_heading: KRISHNA LEADER
dialog: Yeah, well, what's your religion?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Well, I was born Jewish, you know,
dialog: but, uh, but last winter I tried to
dialog: become a Catholic and...it didn't
dialog: work for me. I-I studied and I
dialog: tried and I gave it everything,
dialog: but, you know, Catholicism for me
dialog: was die now, pay later, you know.
dialog: And I just couldn't get with it.
dialog: And I, and I wanted to, you know.
dialog: I--
speaker_heading: KRISHNA LEADER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You're afraid of dying?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Well...yeah, naturally. Aren't you?
dialog: I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation,
dialog: does that mean my soul would pass
dialog: to another human being, or would I
text: come back as a moose or an aardvark
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: KRISHNA LEADER
dialog: (handing some Krishna
dialog: literature over the
dialog: fence to Mickey)
dialog: Take our literature...
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (nodding, taking the material)
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: KRISHNA LEADER
dialog: ...read it over, and think about it.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (looking down at the
dialog: material he's just received)
dialog: Well, okay. Thank you very much.
speaker_heading: KRISHNA LEADER
dialog: You're welcome. Hare Krishna.
text: Mickey walks off, the Hare Krishnas still dancing and
text: singing on the other side of the fence. He flips through
text: the literature as he walks, then looks straight ahead,
text: pondering. His voice is heard over the screen.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Who are you kidding? You're gonna
dialog: be a Krishna? You're gonna shave
dialog: your head and put on robes and
dialog: dance around at airports? You'll
dialog: look like Jerry Lewis. Oh, God,
dialog: I'm so depressed.
text: Mickey puts his hand to his mouth as another title appears
text: on a black screen.
dialog: Autumn chill.
text: Bach's Concerto for Harpsichord is heard as the film cuts to
text: the waterfront at dusk. A bench faces some wharf pilings;
text: the water gently laps against them as Lee walks into view,
text: the wind blowing her hair. She stands and faces the water
text: and the distant skyline across the bay. The view is
text: contemplative, beautiful in the dim light.
text: Lee is alone; her hands are in her pockets. Lee, thinking,
text: is heard over the scene; the harpsichord music plays in the
dialog: background.
speaker_heading: LEE (V.O.)
dialog: The nights are really getting
dialog: cooler. Summer went so quickly.
dialog: Soon it'll be fall.
dialog: (walking to the beach
dialog: and sitting down)
dialog: My literature professor really
dialog: likes me. It was fun being out
dialog: with him last night.
text: (staring pensively at
dialog: the water)
dialog: Funny. I feel like I'm betraying
dialog: Elliot...but that's ridiculous.
dialog: Why shouldn't I see Doug? Elliot's
dialog: not free.
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: Just go one step at a time. Let's
dialog: see what the next few months bring.
text: The concerto stops and the movie cuts to Holly, leaning into
text: an open phone booth near a subway entrance. She wears a
text: football jacket, jeans, and sneakers; she holds a manuscript
text: in her arms. It's a busy corner. People rush past Holly
text: towards the subway; others are walking up the station steps.
text: Holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to Hannah.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (into the telephone)
dialog: Hannah? Hi. Listen, um, you'll be
dialog: happy to know that your money has
dialog: not gone completely to waste... No,
dialog: I have an actual first rough draft
dialog: of something I wrote... Yeah. Yeah.
dialog: Yeah, well, I showed it to Lee, and
dialog: she gave me some good pointers.
dialog: And, um, listen, I'm pretty near
dialog: where you live. I wonder if I
dialog: could just drop it off...and, you
dialog: know, when you have time, some
dialog: time, read it, an-and we'll talk
dialog: when I come over at Thanksgiving.
dialog: Okay? All right. Okay. Oh, wait,
dialog: wait.
dialog: (turning her body,
dialog: still on the phone)
dialog: Listen. Listen. I think Lee met
dialog: an interesting guy at Columbia...
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, well, he sounds really
dialog: nice...
dialog: (puffing on her cigarette)
dialog: Yeah. Okay. All right. Well,
dialog: we'll talk at Thanksgiving. Bye-bye.
text: Holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette.
text: She looks off in the distance, smiling, as the film cuts to:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT
text: It's Thanksgiving at Hannah's once again. Guests are
text: crowded together in the living room, surrounding the piano,
text: where Evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music.
text: Norma stands behind him, leaning against a book-laden wall.
text: The guests are chattering, enjoying themselves; a lamp glows
text: on the corner of the piano. A little boy sitting in a chair
text: next to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is
text: leaning over the arm of the sofa. An adult guest talks to
text: the little boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a
text: glass she'd placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns
text: and addresses the group.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Now, here...here's a song that
dialog: Norma sang on that trip we made up
dialog: to the show in Buffalo. And, oh,
dialog: was she beautiful that night!
text: The guests laugh appreciatively. A woman comes over to Evan
text: and hands him some wine.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: Come on.
dialog: (laughing and touching
dialog: Evan's shoulder)
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (overlapping, to the woman)
dialog: Thank you, honey.
dialog: (putting his drink
dialog: down on the piano)
dialog: Oh, yes, you were, dear. Don't you
dialog: remember that night?
dialog: (gesturing and
dialog: pushing back some
dialog: sheet music that was
dialog: starting to fall)
dialog: She was so beautiful...she was so
dialog: beautiful that when men saw her
text: walking along the streets, they'd
dialog: drive their cars right up on the
dialog: sidewalk.
text: He laughs; the guests laugh with him.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (looking back at Norma)
dialog: Isn't that right, honey, eh?
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (tapping his shoulder)
text: A slight exaggeration.
text: The guest continue to laugh; they are charmed.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (overlapping Norma, laughing)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: But only slight.
text: Evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play
text: the piano. A nearby woman toasts him with her drink. The
text: camera moves around the room as he plays, showing the
text: various guests, chattering over the music. Some are in
text: clusters, in private conversations; others listen and watch
text: the offscreen Evan. A couple stands by the window; one man
text: gets up from his chair and walks away. Some guests sip
text: their drinks, smiling, as the camera moves back to the piano
text: and the book-laden wall. Evan is playing the piano with
text: exuberance. Norma, still standing behind him, has a
text: poignant, wistful expression on her face. She mouths the
text: words to the song Evan is playing, "It Could Happen to You."
text: The woman next to her smiles, enjoying the music, as the
text: camera continues its exploration, moving to a man standing
text: in the doorway with a group of children. Mavis the maid
text: walks by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres. The man takes one,
text: mouthing his thanks, as the camera travels past the open
text: bookshelf, past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and
text: munching, to reveal Lee. She is leaning against another
text: doorway, a faraway look on her face as she listens to the
text: music. Mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway. Several
text: people, deep in conversation, stand nearby as Elliot,
text: holding a drink, walks up behind her.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (sipping his drink)
dialog: You've been very cold to me tonight.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (glancing back at
text: Elliot, then turning away)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: Is something wrong?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Oh, not here.
dialog: (touching Elliot's arm)
text: There are too many people around.
text: Lee slips past Elliot and walks away. Elliot looks back at
text: her briefly, then, sipping his drink, he turns and looks
text: offscreen at the crowd in the living room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Holly is standing in the pantry, preparing some offscreen
text: food. Near her is a restaurantlike swinging door with a
text: glass porthole. In the foreground, the kitchen table is
text: crowded with bowls and plates of food. An open cupboard
text: separates Holly from the rest of the room.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (looking offscreen)
dialog: Hey, Hannah? You know, I think Lee
dialog: is really serious about her new
dialog: boyfriend. Yeah, eh, from what I
dialog: understand he sounds really nice.
text: Hannah walks into view, headed for the refrigerator. She
text: carries two tomatoes.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I'm so happy for her. I think
text: she's in love.
text: Hannah opens the refrigerator, totally ignoring Holly.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Hey, what's the matter?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (taking a bunch of
dialog: celery out and
dialog: slamming the
dialog: refrigerator door)
dialog: I'm real upset about what you wrote.
text: Hannah walks over to the table, gathering up more food.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: My script?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: It's obviously based on Elliot and
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh, so loosely.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: No, not "Oh, so loosely"! Real
dialog: specifically! Is that how you see
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (shrugging, walking
dialog: out of the pantry area)
dialog: Well--
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Can I, can I not accept gestures
dialog: and feelings from people? Do I, do
dialog: I put people off?
text: Holly walks over to the sink and washes her hands.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Well, it's a made-up story.
text: She dries her hands as Hannah, her arms laden with
text: vegetables, strides over to her sister.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: No, it's real exact! The-the
dialog: situations, the dialogue, everything.
text: It's-it's full of intimate details
dialog: between Elliot and me!
dialog: Which I don't, I don't see how you
dialog: could even possibly know about. A
dialog: conversation we once had about
dialog: adoption?
text: Hannah storms out a nearby door as Holly turns away from the
dialog: sink.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing, the towel
text: still in her hand, as
text: she speaks to her
dialog: offscreen sister)
dialog: Well, Lee mentioned that to me, so
dialog: obviously you discussed it with her.
dialog: You...
dialog: (pacing around the table)
dialog: I just took the essence and I blew
text: it up into drama.
text: Holly wipes her hand on the towel as Hannah reenters the
text: kitchen, carrying even more vegetables.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: I don't see how Lee could know
dialog: about these things. I don't! I
dialog: don't tell her everything.
text: Hannah strides into the pantry area and flops the vegetables
text: down on the counter. Holly puts the dishtowel down and
text: absently straightens some things on the food-laden table.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (turning to look at Holly)
dialog: You make it sound like, you know, I
dialog: have no needs or something. You
dialog: think I'm too self-sufficient?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (stopping her mindless
text: straightening at the
dialog: table, reacting)
dialog: Now, Hannah, that's not what I
dialog: meant, you know.
dialog: (walking offscreen to
dialog: the sink area)
dialog: Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you
dialog: for so much. "You're so giving.
dialog: It's not a criticism. We love you.
dialog: We're grateful."
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (walking out of the
dialog: pantry to the food-
dialog: laden table)
dialog: You're grateful, but you resent me.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, wow! I don't want to have this
dialog: conversation. I didn't do anything
dialog: wrong.
text: Hannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table; Holly
text: walks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket. She stops
text: at the corner of the table and faces Hannah.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (onscreen)
dialog: Y-you mentioned to me yourself that
dialog: you and Elliot were having some
dialog: problems.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Yeah, we're having some problems,
dialog: but problems that are my
dialog: business...which I don't see how
dialog: you could know about in such detail.
dialog: How does Lee know about these
dialog: things? How? They're private!
text: Hannah picks up a large bowl and carries it, as well as her
text: armload of spices, into the pantry area.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (turning to look at
dialog: her sister as she
dialog: walks past)
dialog: Well, why don't you share them with
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (with her back to the camera)
dialog: I don't...I don't want to bother
dialog: everyone.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (facing her sister's back)
dialog: That's the point. I'd like to be
dialog: bothered.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (turning to look at Holly)
dialog: I don't see how you could know
dialog: about these things unless Elliot's
dialog: been talking to you.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: No, he hasn't. If I offended you,
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Hannah, reacting, puts the spices down on the pantry counter.
text: Holly turns away.
text: The film cuts to the dining room doorway. Guests can be
text: seen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet
text: table in the living room. Lee and Elliot can be heard
text: offscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across
text: the empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an
text: intense conversation. The piano, as well as soft chatter,
text: is heard in the background.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: It's over, Elliot. I don't know
dialog: how to make it any clearer. It's
dialog: over. I can't see you anymore.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: Uh...
dialog: (onscreen, gesturing)
dialog: I-I-I know. I deserve this.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (touching her chest)
dialog: Look, I'm just as much at fault.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
dialog: If-if-if you can believe I have
dialog: such feelings for you!
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I've got to be honest with you. I
dialog: met someone else. I've met someone
dialog: else.
dialog: (turning and walking
dialog: away from Elliot)
dialog: I...I told you I wasn't going to
dialog: wait forever.
text: Lee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: But it hasn't been forever.
dialog: (walking over to Lee
text: at the just-closed door)
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: It's been nearly a year since our
dialog: first time and you're still married
dialog: to my sister, which...I now realize
dialog: is fine because you're probably
dialog: much more in love with her than you
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
dialog: Yeah. Uh, well, sure we did. An-
dialog: an-and in a way you led me on,
dialog: because I truly believed you were
dialog: unhappy with Hannah. Otherwise, I
dialog: would never have let myself be
dialog: drawn in. I was very weak. So
dialog: were you. Now I've met someone else.
text: The door opens and Mavis appears, holding a set of
text: candlesticks. She walks over to the dining room table,
text: which is already decked out with a floral centerpiece,
text: glassware, and china. She puts them down as Lee and Elliot
text: stand awkwardly near the door, waiting for her to leave.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (to Mavis)
dialog: Dinner soon?
speaker_heading: MAVIS
text: About fifteen minutes.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Uh-huh. Good.
text: Mavis leaves. Both Lee and Elliot quickly close the door
text: behind her and immediately pick up where they'd left off.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: And you're in love overnight?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I care a great deal about him, yes.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (trying to put his
dialog: arm around Lee)
dialog: Lee...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (pulling back,
dialog: flinging her hands)
dialog: Ah, it's over! Elliot, I mean it.
dialog: It's over!
text: They look at each other, reacting, as the film cuts back to
text: Hannah's kitchen. Norma's face can be seen in the porthole
text: window on the other side of the pantry's swinging door. She
text: looks around the kitchen, then opens the door and steps
text: inside. Holly stands nearby, working in the pantry area.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (holding the door,
dialog: half in and half out
dialog: of the kitchen)
dialog: Sweetheart, I loved your script. I
dialog: thought it was so clever.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (turning to Norma,
text: smiling, and holding
dialog: a glass of wine)
dialog: Well, you're my mother. Not
dialog: everybody's gonna be such a sucker.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I particularly liked the character
dialog: of the mother. Just a boozy old
text: flirt with a filthy mouth.
text: Holly chuckles.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: I'm so proud!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh, Mom, thanks.
text: Norma steps back out of the kitchen, the door swinging shut
text: behind her. Holly looks at the door, sipping her wine, as
text: the movie cuts back to Hannah's living room. A chubby,
text: friendly uncle sits on a sofa, one child on his lap and
text: several others gathered cross-legged around him on the floor.
text: They lean on the coffee table, which is covered with glasses
text: and a bowl of chips. Other guests mingle in the background;
text: one couple enters the living room, smiling at the scene on
text: the sofa. Mavis crosses the well-lit foyer in the background
text: and opens the door to more guests. The piano plays on.
speaker_heading: UNCLE
dialog: (raising his bottle
dialog: of beer to the children)
dialog: Now here's a toast to Thanksgiving,
dialog: all right?
text: The children mutter their enthusiastic agreement, picking up
text: their "illicit" glasses of beer.
speaker_heading: UNCLE
dialog: Are we supposed to have beer?
dialog: Yeeeah!
text: The uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids'
text: outstretched glasses. They cry indistinctly with excitement.
speaker_heading: UNCLE
dialog: (overlapping the
text: children's squeals of delight)
dialog: Let me at it!
dialog: (to one of the little boys)
dialog: How's that, Fletcher?
text: Laughing, he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap; he
text: clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding, which
text: is almost as big as she is.
speaker_heading: UNCLE
dialog: (to the little girl)
dialog: Doll? To Thanksgiving. Here's a
dialog: little toast, doll.
dialog: (clinking glasses)
dialog: Come on. Bottoms up.
text: The uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the
text: movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in
text: Hannah's bedroom. Her face moves on to the screen.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (to the offscreen Elliot)
dialog: Have you been talking to Holly or
dialog: Lee about us? About our-our
dialog: personal life?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Me? Of course not.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: There's things Holly wrote about in
dialog: her script about us that are
dialog: so...personal they could only have
dialog: come from you.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Look, I've got a splitting headache
dialog: and I don't like being accused.
text: Hannah walks towards Elliot; he's in the bathroom standing
text: over the sink.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I'm not accusing. I'm asking. Do
dialog: you...do you find me too...too
dialog: giving?
dialog: (closing the door of

text: so only she is seen
dialog: on the screen)
dialog: Too-too-too competent? Too-too, I
dialog: don't know, disgustingly perfect or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: No.
text: Elliot walks from behind the partially closed door to an
text: offscreen medicine cabinet.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (following Elliot and
text: gesturing, talking to
dialog: his back)
dialog: Well, what is it then? What? Eh,
dialog: what's come between us? How have I
dialog: alienated you?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (taking a bottle of
dialog: aspirin from the
dialog: cabinet and walking
text: back to the sink, gesturing)
dialog: Hannah, my head is throbbing.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: You never want to talk about it.
dialog: I-- Every time I bring it up, you-
dialog: you change the subject. What is it?
dialog: Do you-- We're communicating less
dialog: and less. You sleep with me less
dialog: and less.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (angrily turning to
dialog: Hannah and pointing
text: as she shouts)
dialog: Hannah, I am very mixed up! Now
dialog: please!
text: Elliot turns back to the sink, once again obscured by the
text: partially closed door.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
text: (reacting, her voice
text: trembling slightly,
dialog: and gesturing)
dialog: Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind
dialog: my back? Do you? You must. They-
dialog: they seem to know so much about us.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (walking towards a
text: towel rack and gesturing)
dialog: Well, maybe I've asked advice once
dialog: or twice or-or made a joke.
text: He dries his hands as Hannah, standing behind him, continues
dialog: to talk.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you
dialog: talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do
dialog: you, do you, do you phone them?
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
text: (whirling around to
dialog: face Hannah, snapping)
dialog: Leave me alone, can you?!
text: He closes the door, briefly obscuring Hannah and himself
dialog: from view.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (continuing in a
dialog: lower tone)
dialog: Jesus, I've told you. I need
dialog: someone I can matter to.
text: The camera moves behind the closed door, into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (reacting, near tears)
dialog: You matter to me. Completely.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
text: (pausing, his voice
dialog: rising again)
dialog: It's hard to be around someone who
dialog: gives so much and-and needs so
dialog: little in return!
text: He opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (gesturing, pleading)
dialog: But, look...I-I have enormous needs.
text: Elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Well, I can't see them, and neither
dialog: can Lee or Holly!
text: He leaves. Hannah watches him go, reacting. She is stunned.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
text: The dark hallway is illuminated by light coming from the
text: offscreen foyer; pictures line the wall. Piano music is
text: still heard very softly in the background as Hannah, hugging
text: herself, walks slowly down the hallway into the living room.
text: She briefly looks around, lost in thought. She sits down
text: heavily, tiredly, on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts
text: to several framed photographs on the mantel. One shows
text: Hannah and Elliot on their wedding day. Another shows
text: Elliot, obscured in the shadows. Yet another has captured
text: Norma as a young girl. The camera, however, moves closer
text: and closer to a photograph showing Hannah, Lee, and Holly,
text: the three sisters, smiling into the camera. There is no
dialog: sound.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The film shows the bedroom night table, holding a small
text: lamp, a wooden box, a cast-iron fire truck, an ashtray, and
text: glasses. Elliot's pajama-clad arm moves into view. He
text: turns off the lamp; the room is now pitch-black.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: It's so pitch-black tonight. I
dialog: feel lost.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: You're not lost.
text: Elliot turns the lamp back on, then turns to Hannah; she is
text: lying on her side of the bed, partially in shadow. He leans
text: over and kisses her.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT
dialog: I love you so much.
text: They begin to kiss passionately as "Bewitched" starts to
text: play in the background.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: Lucky I ran into you.
text: "Bewitched" continues as the film cuts to a busy nighttime
text: New York City street. Mickey, his hands in his pockets,
text: walks along the sidewalk, one person among many other
text: pedestrians. He pulls his coat tighter around him as he
text: walks. "Bewitched" continues to play as he passes Tower
text: Records' neon-lit window. He glances inside...and sees
text: Holly, her jacket flung over her shoulders, looking at some
dialog: records.
text: Mickey walks through the revolving doors of Tower Records,
text: up a few stairs to the selling floor proper, and stops right
text: in front of Holly.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Mmm, I don't know if you remember
dialog: me, but we had the worst night of
dialog: my life together.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (laughing, holding
dialog: some records)
dialog: I remember you.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Yes, you do recall, right?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, smiling
dialog: and nodding)
dialog: I recall you.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I was walking past and I saw you in
dialog: here...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, nodding)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: ...and I thought I'd come in
dialog: and...and we could replay, uh, the
dialog: whole, uh...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (interrupting,
text: laughing and shaking
dialog: her head)
dialog: We didn't hit it off.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping, smiling)
dialog: Oh, that's putting it mildly. We
text: did everything but exchange gunshots.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Good. How are you?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: You look wonderful.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (chuckling, shaking
dialog: her head)
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping,
dialog: scratching his head)
dialog: Yeah, really. You do. You do.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: It was a terrible evening.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Yeah, it was.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
dialog: Remember slamming the cab door in
dialog: my face and..
text: (touching his nose as
dialog: Holly laughs)
dialog: you know, it came very dangerously
text: close to emasculating my nose in
dialog: a...
dialog: (touching his nose again)
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, laughing)
dialog: I'd never do that.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...in a really horrible way.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (smiling, glancing
dialog: away for a moment)
dialog: Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: You look wonderful. You do. What
dialog: happened to you?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: People change...you know.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (touching Holly's shoulder)
dialog: Well, I hope you've changed.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Yeah, I hope you have, too.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I hope so for your sake, because,
dialog: uh, your personality left something
dialog: to be desired...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, shaking
dialog: her head)
dialog: Yeah, and for yours. I'm sure
dialog: you've changed.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...namely a personality.
text: Holly chuckles and turns to look at more records. She walks
text: down the aisle, occasionally glancing at the bins of records.
text: Mickey walks beside her.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: So how are you?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: You didn't answer my question.
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh, nothing much. You know...
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: ...just some stuff. A little of
dialog: this, a little of that, that's all.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Yeah? Is that an embarrassing
dialog: question? Should I have not asked
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Probably not.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Are you, are you out of work or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: No, well...I've been trying to write.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Have you?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (picking up a record
dialog: and looking at it)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Well, that's interesting. Wh-what
dialog: kind of stuff?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (touching her chin
dialog: for a moment)
dialog: Oh...well, you-you're not interested
dialog: in this.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: No, you can tell me.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: No, I am. I am.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Oh, no, millions of people come up
dialog: to you and say, "Hey, I have
dialog: something I just wrote," right?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Nobody ever said it.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: This is it. Yeah. This is really--
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (interrupting,
dialog: turning from the
dialog: record bins to look
dialog: at Mickey)
dialog: Well, wo-would you be willing to-to
dialog: read it? Something...that I wrote?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (nodding his head)
dialog: Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it
dialog: would mean anything to you. I
dialog: don't know why it would.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (laughing, touching
dialog: her face)
dialog: No, the reason I ask is--
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: You've always hated my taste in the
dialog: past.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (pulling her jacket
dialog: off her shoulders)
dialog: No, I haven't.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: You have.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing, looking
dialog: at Mickey)
dialog: I haven't. No, the reason why I
dialog: ask is I think it might make a
dialog: great, uh, television script, and,
dialog: you know, you're so active in
dialog: television, so--
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (chuckling, gesturing)
dialog: I'm not anymore. I haven't, I
dialog: haven't been in television for a
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You're kidding me.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I've done no television whatsoever.
dialog: No.
text: As Mickey continues to speak, Holly walks to another bin of
text: records, reacting to his words. She looks offscreen at him,
text: then down at some records. The camera follows her.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen, continuing)
dialog: I may, I may have to get back into
dialog: it, 'cause my accountant says that
dialog: I'm running out of dollars.
dialog: But...but, um, no, I haven't, I
dialog: just sort of dropped out for a
dialog: year...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, nodding)
dialog: Oh. Oh.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
text: ...which is a long, dull story and
dialog: I won't get into it. But--
text: Mickey walks back onscreen to Holly. The two of them are
text: partially obscured by a large white Jazz sign imprinted with
text: a large red circle as they continue their conversation.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You're okay, though, huh?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I'm-- Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm
dialog: fine. How are you?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (face offscreen,
dialog: obscured by the sign)
dialog: Oh, I'm fine.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: What...what about your script?
dialog: (face offscreen
dialog: obscured by the sign)
dialog: So what's it about?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (face offscreen)
dialog: Well, I'd love it if you'd read it,
dialog: actually, 'cause I really would
dialog: value your opinion.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (face offscreen)
dialog: You have to remember, we-we-we
dialog: didn't agree on one thing.
text: They emerge from behind the Jazz sign, still walking, still
text: talking.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (smiling, gesturing)
dialog: But you have to remember while
dialog: you're reading and you're cursing
dialog: my name, you know, that this is my
dialog: first script. Well, it's not my
dialog: first script.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Hmm.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (touching her face)
dialog: Actually, my first script was about
dialog: Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: ...Hannah read it, she got really
dialog: angry, and... you know, then I felt
dialog: badly, so I--
text: She picks up a record.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Oh, well, God, I can imagine what
dialog: you wrote.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Oh, no! It wasn't anything bad.
dialog: But she just... you know. I don't
dialog: know.
text: Mickey pulls out a record and looks at it.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: So, uh...I threw it out, but I have
dialog: this other one.
text: Holly looks hopefully at Mickey.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Well, you know, I-I-I...you know,
dialog: if you want me to, I'll read it.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
dialog: Oh, gosh, I don't know.
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: Well, could I come over tomorrow
dialog: and read it to you?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
text: Holly laughs, embarrassed, as Mickey puts the record he's
text: been looking at back in the bin.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: You must be joking. I've been
dialog: doing all my own reading since I
dialog: was forty...you know.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (laughing, looking at Mickey)
dialog: Hmm. I think it's lucky I ran into
dialog: you.
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Well, what about me?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (chuckling, waving
dialog: her arm)
dialog: Oh, well.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping, gesturing)
dialog: I should have kept going. I-I have
text: a sneaking feeling, a nagging
dialog: sensation I should've kept walking
dialog: and...
text: Holly chuckles, looking off for a moment.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing, looking
dialog: at Holly)
dialog: ...and not begun this conversation.
text: There is a brief pause and the movie cuts to:
scene_heading: INT. MICKEY'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The screen shows a chaise in Mickey's apartment; an ashtray
text: on a stand sits nearby. The camera moves down the chaise,
text: past several piles of books, to Mickey's coffee table. He
text: sits, picking at his fingers and listening, on the edge of
text: the table in front of Holly, who is sitting cross-legged on
text: the floor, propped up with a pillow, reading her script aloud.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (offscreen, as the
text: camera moves across
text: the room towards her
dialog: and Mickey, reading)
dialog: "We all go through life playing the
dialog: hand we're dealt. Craig: And what
dialog: hand were you dealt?
dialog: (onscreen now)
dialog: "Emily: I'm two high pair, maybe
dialog: even aces up. The problem is,
dialog: you've got three deuces."
text: Holly closes the script and looks up at Mickey.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: That's the end.
text: Mickey smiles and shrugs, not knowing what to say.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: No, you can tell me straight. It's
dialog: okay. Just, you know, tell me what
dialog: you think.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: (shaking his head, shrugging)
dialog: It's great. I swea-- I'm-- I'm,
dialog: tch, I'm speechless. I was...I was
dialog: not in the mood to listen to this
dialog: thing now.
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: I don't know what to say. I'm
dialog: moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I,
dialog: you know, I was on the edge of my
dialog: seat. I just think it's wonderful!
dialog: I'm, I'm totally...stunned. This
dialog: is not an insult. I'm amazed that
dialog: you can...
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: It was-- I just thought it was great.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (reacting)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (grunting and gesturing)
dialog: Yes! I was abso-- And...w-
dialog: what...made you think of that
dialog: climax scene where the, where the...
text: architect is walking home with his
dialog: actress girlfriend and-and the ex-
text: wife who's schizophrenic jumps out
text: of the bushes and stabs him to death?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (laughing and nodding)
dialog: Oh, it just came to me one day.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Well, it was just fabulous! I'm,
dialog: I, you know...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (gasping, hitting her
dialog: forehead with her hand)
dialog: Oh, gosh, you really think I can
dialog: write?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: I thought it was wonder-- There's
dialog: maybe one or two things in there
dialog: that I would do differently myself,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gasping and nodding)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...but who cares? It was just--
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: It was fabulous.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (smiling and shaking
dialog: his head)
dialog: Fabulous, I mean it! I'm so
dialog: impressed.
text: Holly, thrilled with Mickey's overwhelming response, stands
text: up, her hand on her head.
text: Unable to contain herself, she begins to walk up and down
text: the room, holding her script. The camera follows her;
text: Mickey is now offscreen.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Oh, God!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: I am. You-you made my day.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Oh, wow!
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: It was just great. Uh, I was all
dialog: set...I was set to be bored stiff.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: (grinning, looking at
dialog: the offscreen Mickey)
dialog: Uh, gee. Would you like to have
dialog: lunch? Uh, uh...
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: I-I would love to talk to you
dialog: about, uh, that script. I-I, you
dialog: know, I think maybe that we could
dialog: do something with it.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Okay, and listen, I would like to
dialog: hear what made you suddenly decide
dialog: to drop out of life.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (offscreen)
dialog: Oh, who cares?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Y-you used to-- Oh, no! Yeah, I
dialog: care. You used to be so ambitious
dialog: and...
dialog: (pausing, grinning)
dialog: God, you really liked it?!
text: "You Made Me Love You" starts to play as the movie cuts to
text: the street outside Mickey's apartment house, an old building
text: complete with a red entrance door and a gray, weather-beaten
text: façade. Trees line the sidewalk. Holly and Mickey emerge
text: from the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row
text: of similar apartment buildings. They pass a few other
text: people as they walk.
text: The film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and
text: stainedwood café. Through the window, Holly and Mickey can
text: be seen having lunch. Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey
text: takes a sip of coffee. Some people pass by.
text: Next, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central
text: Park, complete, with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered
text: leaves. Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Gosh, you really went through a
dialog: crisis, you know that? H-how did
dialog: you get over it? I mean, when I
dialog: ran into you, you seemed, you
dialog: seemed just perfectly fine. Well,
dialog: you seem fine now.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Well...
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: I'll tell you.
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: One day about a month ago...
text: The film abruptly cuts to Mickey's flashback, a visual
text: counterpoint to the story he is telling Holly. A close-up
text: of a nervous, perspiring, and panting Mickey alone in his
text: apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: ...I really hit bottom. You know,
dialog: I just felt that in a Godless
dialog: universe, I didn't want to go on
dialog: living. Now I happen to own this
dialog: rifle...
dialog: (coughing)
text: Mickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead. He
text: shuts his eyes tightly.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: ...which I loaded, believe it or
text: not, and pressed it to my forehead.
dialog: And I remember thinking, at the
dialog: time, I'm gonna kill myself. Then
dialog: I thought...what if I'm wrong?
dialog: What if there is a God? I mean,
dialog: after all, nobody really knows that.
text: The camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on
text: the wall behind him. Its reflection shows his spiral
text: staircase and some standing lamps. A clock faintly ticks.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: But then I thought, no. You know,
dialog: maybe is not good enough. I want
dialog: certainty or nothing. And I
dialog: remember very clearly the clock was
dialog: ticking, and I was sitting there
text: frozen, with the gun to my head,
text: debating whether to shoot.
text: The gun goes off with a loud bang. The mirror shatters.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
text: All of a sudden, the gun went off.
text: Mickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the
text: shattered mirror. The sounds of his excited neighbors,
text: their shouting, a knocking door, are heard as he continues
dialog: his tale.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: I had been so tense, my finger had
dialog: squeezed the trigger inadvertently...
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR #1
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: What's happening? Wh-wh-what's
dialog: going on?
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...but I was perspiring so much,
text: the gun had slid off my forehead
dialog: and missed me.
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR #2
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: I don't know. I heard a gun. Is
dialog: everything all right?
text: Mickey, still brandishing the rifle, runs into his sunlit
text: living room. He looks around frantically, his shirt loose.
text: Finally, he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the
text: coffee table. The gun goes off a second time. Mickey,
text: standing nearby, jumps, his hands flying to his head. The
text: doorbell rings; the neighbors begin pounding at the door.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: And suddenly, neighbors were, were,
dialog: pounding on the door, and-and I
dialog: don't know, the whole scene was
dialog: just pandemonium. And, uh, you
dialog: know, and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door.
text: Mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: I-I-I-I didn't know what to say.
dialog: You know, I was, I was embarrassed
dialog: and confused, and my-my-my mind was
dialog: r-r-racing a mile a minute...
text: He returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once
text: again around the living room.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: ...and I-I jus knew one thing.
text: The film cuts to a West Side street. It's an overcast day.
text: Mickey, walking slowly along the sidewalk, passes several
text: other pedestrians and numerous storefronts, including
text: Klein's Pharmacy and a "Bar-B-Q" take out. Occasionally, he
text: is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the
text: street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: I...I-I-I-I had to get out of that
dialog: house. I had to just get out in
dialog: the fresh air and-and clear my head.
dialog: And I remember very clearly. I
dialog: walked the streets. I walked and I
dialog: walked. I-I didn't know what was
dialog: going through my mind. It all
text: seemed so violent and un-unreal to
dialog: me. And I wandered...
text: The movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater,
text: with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel.
text: An old publicity photo hangs inside. Mickey's reflection is
text: seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the
text: reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by. His
text: reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues
dialog: his story.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: ...for a long time on the Upper
dialog: West Side, you know, an-and it must
dialog: have been hours! You know, my, my
dialog: feet hurt. My head was, was
dialog: pounding, and, and I had to sit
dialog: down. I went into a movie house.
dialog: I-I didn't know what was playing or
dialog: anything.
text: Mickey walks into the movie house. He is seen through the
text: glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic
text: outside. He makes his way through the lobby into the actual
dialog: theater.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: I just, I just needed a moment to
dialog: gather my thoughts and, and be
dialog: logical, and, and put the world
text: back into rational perspective.
text: The film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white
text: screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the
text: helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live
text: xylophone. The sounds of the "xylophone" are heard as the
text: movie cuts to the darkened theater, where Mickey slowly sits
text: down in a balcony seat. The "xylophone" music stops and
text: changes to "Hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-ho" as sung
text: by the Marx Brothers and ensemble in the movie. The singing
text: continues faintly in the background as Mickey continues his
dialog: tale:
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: And I went upstairs to the balcony,
dialog: and I sat down
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: and, you know, the movie was a-a-a
dialog: film that I'd seen many times in my
dialog: life since I was a kid, an-and I
dialog: always u-uh, loved it. And, you
dialog: know, I'm, I'm watching these
dialog: people up on the screen, and I
dialog: started getting hooked o-on the
dialog: film, you know?
text: The film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as
text: Mickey continues to talk. The Marx Brothers, as well as the
text: hundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup, are kneeling
text: and bowing as they sing "Hidee-hidee-ho." They kick their
text: heels up in the air. They sway back and forth, hands
text: clasped, singing "Oh-h-h-h-h-h..."
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: ...And I started to feel how can
dialog: you even think of killing yourself?
dialog: I mean, isn't it so stupid? I
dialog: mean, l-look at all the people up
dialog: there on the screen. You know,
dialog: they're real funny, and, and what
dialog: if the worst is true?
text: The movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in
text: the dark theater. The Oh-h-h-h-h-h's coming from the
text: offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: What if there's no God, and you
dialog: only go around once and that's it?
dialog: Well, you know, don't you want to
dialog: be part of the experience? You
dialog: know, what the hell, it-i-it's not
dialog: all a drag. And I'm thinking to
dialog: myself, geez, I should stop ruining
dialog: my life...
text: As Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the
text: Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen. The
text: four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting,
text: their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: ...searching for answers I'm never
dialog: gonna get, and just enjoy it while
dialog: it lasts. And...you know...
text: The film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (V.O.)
dialog: ...after, who knows? I mean, you
dialog: know, maybe there is something.
dialog: Nobody really knows. I know, I
dialog: know "maybe" is a very slim reed to
dialog: hang your whole life on, but that's
dialog: the best we have. And...then, I
dialog: started to sit back, and I actually
dialog: began to enjoy myself.
text: As Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the
text: black-and-white screen. The Marx Brothers are sitting on a
text: judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other
text: cast members. They jump down from the bench, still singing.
text: Their voices swell.
scene_heading: MARX BROTHERS &amp; COMPANY
dialog: "Oh, Freedonia
dialog: Oh, don't you cry for me
dialog: They'll be coming around the
dialog: mountain..."
text: The Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the
text: movie cuts back to Central Park. The flashback is over.
text: Mickey and Holly continue their stroll as "You Made Me Love
text: You" begins to play in the background. They pass some
text: people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and
text: the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the
text: camera moves back, farther and farther away from them,
text: showing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Um...look, there's something I've,
dialog: uh, that's been bothering me for a
dialog: long time, and I just thought I'd
dialog: just tell you what it was and just
dialog: sort of clear the deck here, and
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: that's this.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: Oh, yeah? What?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: That I've always regretted the way
dialog: I behaved that evening we went out,
dialog: and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd
dialog: tell you that because I really made
dialog: a fool out of myself.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Oh, don't be silly! No! Don't be
dialog: ridiculous.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: It's all right.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I was the, I was... You know, it
dialog: was my fault. I--
dialog: (inhaling)
text: Holly laughs.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: So, so you want to go out to dinner
dialog: again? I mean, is that, is that...
dialog: Have, you have any interest in
dialog: that, or...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Sure. Sure, uh, yes.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Do you? I mean, are you, are you,
dialog: are you, are you free this evening?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Yeah.
text: They stroll offscreen. "You Made Me Love You" grows louder
dialog: and the film cuts to:
dialog: One year later.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING - NIGHT
text: A large, perfectly roasted turkey on a serving plate briefly
text: fills the screen as the camera moves across the food-laden
text: table in Hannah's kitchen, past an electric mixer, several
text: bowls, spices, tomatoes, and parsley, to reveal Evan walking
text: through the doorway.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (holding a drink)
dialog: I want ice! Who's got some--
dialog: (pointing to an ice
dialog: bucket on the table)
dialog: Oh, there it is.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen, overlapping)
dialog: It's on the table, Dad.
text: The sounds of Thanksgiving guests in the other room are
text: dimly heard; "You Made Me Love You" continues softly in the
text: background. Mavis passes the table, licking some food off
text: her hand. Hannah, in the background, is busy by the stove.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (putting ice into his glass)
dialog: Hey, where's Holly? She's late.
text: As Mavis leaves the kitchen, Lee enters, carrying some empty
dialog: glasses.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: (walking briskly to
dialog: the sink)
dialog: Hey, Hannah, did you read that last
dialog: thing Holly wrote? It was great.
dialog: She's really developed.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (offscreen, in
dialog: another area of the kitchen)
dialog: I know, she...she really writes
dialog: good dialogue.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (turning to the
dialog: offscreen Hannah)
dialog: Yeah. I'll get some ice.
text: Lee walks off, drying her wet hands in the air. Hannah, in
text: a silk dress, moves onscreen, going to the table and pouring
text: herself a glass of wine as Norma enters the kitchen.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: Hannah, can I tell everybody you're
dialog: going to play Desdemona?
text: Norma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a
text: bottle of gin.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (taking a big sip of
dialog: her wine)
dialog: Oh, Mom, it's only television.
dialog: (beginning to mash
dialog: some sweet potatoes
text: in a bowl on the table)
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: (gesturing with the bottle)
dialog: Yes, but it's public television.
dialog: And to me, Shakespeare doesn't get
dialog: any greater than Othello. You with
dialog: some big black stud! I love it!
text: Norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her
text: empty glass as Hannah stops her mashing, reacting.
speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: (gasping and laughing)
dialog: Oh, Mom!
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: (overlapping, reacting)
dialog: Oh, honey!
text: The movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between
text: the dining room and the living room. Upbeat jazz plays over
text: the low din of the party. Two women stand by the partially
text: set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates,
text: as Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink. He passes the
text: women and walks through the doorway into the living room,
text: nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way.
text: He enters the living room, smiling. It is crowded with
text: guests; Hannah's children play in their midst. One of
text: Hannah's boys grabs Elliot's arm. They playfully "spar" for
text: a moment before Elliot laughingly shakes him off, continuing
text: on his way into a connecting room. He stops at the doorway,
text: looking at the crowd. The camera shows his point of view:
text: Guests stand in clusters, enjoying themselves; one woman
text: chats with a little boy; another woman, carrying a drink,
text: walks over to a group of other guests.
text: The film then cuts back briefly to Elliot, holding his drink
text: and looking straight ahead, as it shows his point of view
text: once more. This time he sees a smiling Lee and Doug,
text: talking animatedly; a few guests are seen in the background.
text: Elliot's voice is heard over a close-up of the couple.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, Lee, you are something.
text: Lee and Doug kiss each other. They continue talking.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: You look very beautiful. Marriage
dialog: agrees with you. Everything that
dialog: happened between us
dialog: (pausing)
text: seems more and more hazy.
text: As Lee takes a sip of her drink, the movie cuts back to
text: Elliot, standing in the doorway and still staring straight
text: ahead. The camera moves in closer to his face as he talks
text: over the scene.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: I acted like such a fool. I don't
dialog: know what came over me. That
dialog: complete conviction that I couldn't
dialog: live without you.
text: The film quickly cuts to a brief look at Lee and Doug, still
text: talking animatedly and smiling. Lee gently pushes back
text: Doug's hair.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: What did I put us both through?
dialog: And Hannah...
text: The camera moves back to Elliot.
speaker_heading: ELLIOT (V.O.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...who as you once said, I love
dialog: much more than I realized.
text: After pausing for a moment on Elliot's face, the film cuts
text: to the foyer, where two boys and a girl gather by the door.
text: One boy opens it, revealing Holly. She joyfully enters the
text: apartment, greeting each child with an enthusiastic kiss.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (kissing the children)
dialog: Hi! How are you!
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: Happy Thanksgiving!
dialog: (kissing)
speaker_heading: BOY #1
dialog: Hi!
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I didn't miss dinner, did I?
speaker_heading: CHILDREN
dialog: (overlapping, talking
dialog: at once)
dialog: No!
text: The jazz ends as the record scratches and stops. Evan's
text: rendition of "Isn't It Romantic" is heard on the piano as
text: Holly, shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her
text: shoulder, walks towards the living room. She is stopped by
text: three guests--two women, one of them wearing glasses, and a
text: man--who are coming out of the room.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Huh? Hi, Marge.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST #1
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: You look lovely.
text: They kiss.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST #2
dialog: (overlapping, hugging Holly)
dialog: Hello, darling.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Happy Thanksgiving.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST #2
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Good to see you. Same to you.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (hugging the man)
dialog: Hello.
text: The movie cuts to Hannah, leaning contentedly against a
text: doorway into the living room and listening to the offscreen
text: Evan play the piano. Elliot, holding his drink, walks over
text: to her. They look at each other for a beat; Elliot then
text: hugs Hannah, pulling her towards him. She leans her head on
text: his shoulder, fingering his jacket lapel. They look
text: offscreen together, happily, intimately, at the offscreen
text: guests, as the camera moves across the room, past a few
text: guests, to reveal Evan sitting at the piano. Norma sits at
text: his side, one arm resting on the piano. She holds a drink
text: and looks off in the distance, mouthing the words to "Isn't
dialog: It Romantic."
text: The camera then moves to the doorway in the living room,
text: where a man, holding a drink, enters and joins the happy
text: crowd. Evan can be seen in the background, playing his song.
text: A child plays near the coffee table.
text: The camera continues to move past the doorway, past a huge
text: grandfather clock, to a second doorway leading to the den.
text: Here, more guests are gathered; a child sits in a small
text: chair by the sofa. He sips a soda as female guest #2 enters
text: the room and crouches down next to him, smiling. She waves
text: to him. He waves back as the camera continues to move past
text: the doorway to reveal Holly, standing in front of a hallway
text: mirror, fixing her earrings. Mavis can be seen in the
text: background, through the doorway into the dining room,
text: lighting the candles on the table. She dims the lights,
text: darkening the room and the hallway where Holly stands in a
text: warm candlelit glow. Mavis leaves the dining room and
text: passes Holly.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (still fixing her
dialog: earrings, to Mavis)
dialog: It's beautiful.
text: Mavis walks off. Holly, reflected in the mirror, begins
text: fluffing her hair as Mickey enters and wraps his arms around
text: her from behind. The camera stays focused on the mirror;
text: both Holly and Mickey are now seen in its reflection.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (smacking his lips)
dialog: Now don't get nervous. It's just
dialog: your husband.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Hi.
dialog: (kissing Holly)
dialog: How you doin'?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (nestling against Mickey)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: When'd you get here?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Just a few minutes ago.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (kissing her again)
dialog: You look so beautiful.
text: Mickey continues to kiss Holly. She responds, sighing and
text: closing her eyes.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (kissing Holly's neck)
dialog: You know, I was talking with your
dialog: father before...and I was telling
dialog: him that
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: it's ironic. I-I used to always
dialog: have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and
dialog: I never thought
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: that I could love anybody else.
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: And here it is, years later and I'm
dialog: married to you
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: and completely in love with you.
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: The heart is a very, very resilient
dialog: little muscle.
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: It really is. I...
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: It'd made a great story, I think.
dialog: A guy marries one sister...
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: doesn't work out...
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: many years later...
dialog: (kissing)
dialog: he winds up
dialog: (inhaling)
dialog: married to the other sister. It's,
dialog: you know, it's a...
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (fondling Mickey's
dialog: arm, smiling)
dialog: Tch.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: I don't know how you're gonna top
dialog: that.
text: Mickey continues to kiss Holly's neck; he chuckles.
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: (kissing Mickey's cheek)
dialog: Mickey?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (kissing Holly's neck)
dialog: Mmm, what?
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I'm pregnant.
text: The mirror shows Mickey pulling away slightly, reacting.
text: They look at each other at arm's length, Holly grinning.
text: Mickey in shock, then embrace and kiss passionately, tighter
text: and tighter, as the music swells...
text: And the credits appear, white on a black screen.
