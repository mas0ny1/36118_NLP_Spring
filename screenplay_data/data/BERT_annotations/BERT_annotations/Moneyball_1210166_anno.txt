scene_heading: 1 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 1
text: Static shots: A deserted locker room. Empty showers.
text: Cinder-block tunnels lit with wire-encased lamps like in
text: a coal mine. THREE SECURITY GUARDS watch a game on a TV.
speaker_heading: LEGEND: October 15, 2001
dialog: 
text: We begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the
text: faint voice of an announcer -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENNAMAN V/O
dialog: ... nobody on, two and two to Saenz - who
text: has just three at bats in the series, and
text: none of them hits - as he settles back in
dialog: -
scene_heading: 2 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM -NIGHT 2
dialog: 
text: At the end of a tunnel, the A's empty dugout. The empty
text: diamond. Just a couple of the floodlights are on.
speaker_heading: BRENNAMAN V/O
text: - Rivera looks in for the sign, he has
dialog: it, the pitch, Saenz swings and -
dialog: 
text: The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut
text: off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that
text: wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in
text: fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure
text: seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on:
speaker_heading: STEVE LYONS V/O
dialog: - a ground out to second, Thom, is not
dialog: what the A's were looking for from Saenz -
dialog: down by two in the ninth -
dialog: 
text: The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of
text: peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty
text: diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the
text: baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the
dialog: radio back on -
speaker_heading: BRENNAMAN V/O
text: Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout
dialog: to bat for Menechino -
dialog: 2.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He turns it off again. Calmly eats a peanut. Waits.
text: Switches the radio back on -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENNAMAN V/O
text: - the A's are down to their last strike
dialog: and this Yankee crowd is on its feet -
text: Rivera squints for the sign, he has it,
dialog: delivers and -
text: Again, at the crucial moment, he cuts the radio. Waits
text: just a few moments. Turns the radio back on -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENNAMAN V/O
text: It is bedlam in New York. The Yankees -
dialog: down two games to none - have come back
dialog: to win three, and the Division Series.
dialog: 
text: The outcome of the series seems to have no effect on
text: Billy. He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and
text: climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly
text: hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward
text: an exit, the voice of one of the announcers -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVE LYONS V/O
dialog: This is an exceptional feat not only for
dialog: New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though
dialog: not the kind you can be proud of: Only
dialog: once before has a team lost a Division
dialog: Series after winning the first two games -
scene_heading: 3 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 3
dialog: 
text: It's coming from a small television a night security
text: guard is watching. But when he sees Billy approaching,
text: he quickly shuts it off.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.
dialog: It's no big deal.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: No, it's okay, I don't need to watch it.
dialog: 
text: The guard's eyes consider the baseball Billy absently
text: turns in his hands -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How's Meg?
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: She's good, thanks.
dialog: 
text: - and the glass window of the bar behind him -
dialog: 3.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: And the boys?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: They're good. Everybody's good.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's good.
text: The security guard waits for the baseball to sail through
text: the glass, but it doesn't happen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Night.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Night, Billy. It was a great season.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. COLISEUM - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 4
text: A lone car sits in the parking lot in front of the

speaker_heading: TARA V/O
dialog: They had three times your payroll, Billy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: TARA V/O
dialog: You're not watching them celebrate,
dialog: right?
text: Car's off. Billy sits in the dark on his phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No. That would be, uh--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TARA V/O
dialog: Pointless? Self-destructive? Masochistic?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Are you asking me to pick one?
speaker_heading: TARA V/O
dialog: What you should be doing is thinking
dialog: about what an amazing job you did and how
dialog: great you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'll be honest, right this minute I'm not
dialog: thinking about either of those things.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TARA V/O
dialog: You take a team with that payroll to the
dialog: playoffs? You take the Yankees to a fifth
dialog: game? I'm not even sure the better team
dialog: won.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: They were down two-love and then beat us
dialog: three in a row. Trust me, the better team
dialog: won.
dialog: 
text: BILLY presses a button on his portable radio and is hit
dialog: with sound of sports talk radio--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER V/O
dialog: --while embarrassing the entire city and
dialog: making a mockery of their fans. I'm sick
dialog: of this.
speaker_heading: TARA V/O

speaker_heading: TARA V/O
dialog: Someplace they don't have a baseball
dialog: team.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: How about Oakland?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TARA V/O
dialog: Okay, here are the rules for tonight. You
dialog: can do anything you want but you can't
dialog: give any quotes to the press, go on the
dialog: internet or hurt my car, we have a deal?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TARA V/O
dialog: They had three times your payroll, Billy.
dialog: From the radio we've been hearing shards of "--an

dialog: 
text: Billy gets out of the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Great. I'm on my way.

scene_heading: 5 INT. OAKLAND AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 5
dialog: 
text: Blur of shapes and colors as we move through a crush of

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Is it Boston? You're talking to Boston?
dialog: What are they offering?
speaker_heading: BORAS (ON PHONE)
dialog: What does it matter to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORAS V/O
dialog: I mean -- what does it matter since
dialog: whatever it is you can't afford it.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You don't know that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORAS V/O
dialog: I don't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TICKET CLERK
dialog: You need to hurry.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't know that -- since I don't know
dialog: what they're offering.
speaker_heading: (TO TARA)
dialog: What did she say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TARA

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What did they offer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORAS V/O
dialog: They offered seven and a quarter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Just to be clear -- they offered seven
dialog: and a quarter.
speaker_heading: BORAS V/O
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: As opposed to you said seven and a
dialog: quarter and they're thinking about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORAS V/O
dialog: No, they offered seven and a quarter and
dialog: I'm thinking about it.
dialog: (nothing from Billy)
dialog: And you're thinking -- what.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'm thinking I don't want to lose Damon,
dialog: but I don't pay my whole infield seven
dialog: million dollars.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: We're losing Damon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORAS V/O
dialog: For seven and a half, Billy, you can keep
dialog: Johnny Damon and we can be done thinking.
dialog: I have to go, my plane is boarding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Wait, don't hang up. Don't hang up --
dialog: 
text: Billy drops the phone in a plastic container, steps

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We had a deal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BORAS (V.O.)
dialog: We have a deal. If it's eight million.
speaker_heading: BILLY

dialog: always gonna be a quarter million short?

dialog: 
text: Billy and his scouting department - ten men older than
text: him - all former players and tobacco chewers still, each
text: with his own can of Copenhagen and wastebasket - sitting
text: around a large underground cinder block "war room" whose

text: Two large white-boards dominate a wall, covered with

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: On the left board - every player in the A's organization.
text: On the other, even larger board - every player that may
dialog: be of interest to them from the other organizations.
dialog: 
dialog: It's the most complex chess board you will ever see.
text: But what can be easily discerned are the obvious holes in
text: the A's team - the star players they are about to lose -
dialog: their names set apart from the positions they're
dialog: vacating: Jason Giambi (1B), Johnny Damon (CF), Jason
speaker_heading: Isringhausen (RP).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Alright, guys... we had a great year. We
dialog: won 102 games and we only came a buck
dialog: short in New York. Now the bad news...
dialog: we've got three big holes to fill.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Let's start with who we like for Giambi.
dialog: We'll go around the room. Who you like,
dialog: Matty?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I like Geronimo.
dialog: (approval from the
speaker_heading: OTHER SCOUTS)
dialog: Guy's an athlete. This guy is big, fast
dialog: and talented.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Six foot four.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PITTARO
dialog: Top of my list.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POTE
dialog: Clean cut, good face.
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: Good jaw. He's the real deal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Five tools, good lookin'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Can he hit?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: He's a tools guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Can he hit?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: He's got a great swing. Natural swing.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: So you're saying he can't hit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: He can hit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
text: The ball explodes off his bat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: It's exciting. When he hits it sounds
text: like he's droppin' a firecracker at his
dialog: feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PITTARO
dialog: Down in the pisser you can hear that
dialog: sound.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Sounds like Mays, Mantle, Aaron...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's not what I asked. I asked can he
dialog: hit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: He's a good hitter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: If he's a good hitter, why doesn't he hit
dialog: good?
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: He needs a little work. He'll be able to
dialog: hit. He could be a great hitter.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Right... we put him up against big league
dialog: competition and suddenly he'll be able to
dialog: hit.
dialog: 
dialog: Grady moves on --
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Artie, who do we like?
dialog: 
text: Billy backs off, incredulous as the scouts prattle on --
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: I like Perez. He swings like a man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
text: He swings like a man who swings at too
dialog: much.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: There's some work needs to be done. I
dialog: admit it. He needs to be reworked a
text: little. But he's noticeable.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He's notable?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: No, he's noticeable. You notice him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEOGH
dialog: He's got an ugly girlfriend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: What's that mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEOGH
dialog: Ugly girlfriend means no confidence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Alright. That's true.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PITTARO
dialog: I agree with Art. I like the way he
text: walks into a room. Kid's so confident
text: his dick gets there two minutes before he
dialog: does.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: Passes the eye candy test. He's got the
text: looks, he's ready to play the part. He
dialog: just needs some playing time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEOUGH
dialog: I'm just saying, his girlfriend's a 6.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Billy, if you want to talk about another
dialog: Giambi, this guy could be it.
text: Enough. Billy raises a book above the table, drops it
text: with a dull THUD... STOPPING TRAFFIC.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Is that a suggestion, Billy?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Guys, stop. You're talking like this is
dialog: business as usual. It's not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: We're trying to solve the problem.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Not like this. You're not even looking
dialog: at the problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: We not only have a very clear
dialog: understanding of the problem we now face,
dialog: but everyone in this room has faced
dialog: similar problems countless times before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Good. What's the problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: The problem is that we've lost 3 key
dialog: players that we now have to replace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Uh-uh. What's the problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PITTARO
dialog: The problem is the same as it always is;
dialog: we've got to put a team together with
dialog: what we've got.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Uh-uh. What's the problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: We've got 38 home runs to replace, 120
dialog: rbi's, 47 doubles...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Okay, stop. The problem we're trying to
dialog: solve is that this is an unfair game.
dialog: There are rich teams, poor teams, 50 feet
dialog: of crap and then there's us. And now
dialog: we've been gutted. We're organ donors to
dialog: the rich. The Red Sox took our kidneys
dialog: and the Yankees took our heart. And now
dialog: I'm listening to the same old shit about
dialog: having a good body and being a tools guy
dialog: like you're looking for Fabio. Is there
dialog: another first baseman like Giambi?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Is there?
text: Everyone mumbles "no."
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Then stop looking for one because what
dialog: we'll surely wind up with is the
text: McNuggets version of Giambi.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Look, we're gonna find 25 guys, put `em
dialog: through player development, teach `em how
dialog: to play Oakland A baseball. This is no
dialog: time to push the panic button. This is
dialog: the way we've been doing it for 150
dialog: years. Let us do our job.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: If we try to play like the Yankees in
dialog: here, we're not going to be able to play
dialog: with them out there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: That's fortune cookie wisdom.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No, it's just regular wisdom.
speaker_heading: POTE
dialog: Who's Fabio?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Okay, Billy. Clearly you have something
dialog: on your mind.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Bill James.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: You're not serious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PITTARO
dialog: We're not playing fantasy baseball,
dialog: Billy.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Those aren't new ideas, they disproved
dialog: that years ago.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Bill James was a night security guard at
dialog: the Stokely Van Camp Pork and Beans
dialog: Factory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He thinks differently than anyone in
dialog: baseball.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He's not in baseball. He's in pork and
dialog: beans.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What if we've been wrong this whole time
dialog: about what ingredients manufacture a win?
dialog: What if this whole time we thought it was
dialog: the chicken that made the chicken soup
dialog: taste good when really it was the onions
dialog: that made the chicken soup taste good?
dialog: Onions are a lot cheaper than chicken,
dialog: you see what I'm saying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POTE
dialog: I don't have the first idea what you're
dialog: saying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We gotta start over. We gotta rethink
dialog: this thing. We gotta look where others
dialog: aren't looking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: With all due respect, we've been doing
dialog: this for a long time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That doesn't mean you're doing it right.
dialog: Do you watch nature docs? You know what
dialog: happens to the runt of the litter? He
dialog: dies. I'm open to any solution, as long
dialog: as it's not what the other guys are
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Now, I'm going to Cleveland to poach an
dialog: outfielder named Brandon Garcia --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TBD SCOUT
dialog: Hold on -- You're going to Cleveland for
dialog: a double-A guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Billy, I've seen Garcia. He's got a bad
text: body. It's not a pretty sight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PITTARO
text: Kid wears a large pair of underwear.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEOGH
dialog: That is a big boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: He's not just big, but kind of doughy. A
text: fleshy kind of body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Oh, you mean like Babe Ruth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOUTS (UNISON)
dialog: He's no Babe Ruth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PITTARO
text: When he walks, Billy, his thighs stick
dialog: together. There's enough friction there
text: to start a bonfire.
speaker_heading: KEOGH
dialog: If you saw him, I'm telling you, you
dialog: wouldn't want to go to Cleveland.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Billy, can I make a suggestion? If you
dialog: could get Ricardo Rincon... he'd be worth
dialog: the trip to Cleveland.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That would solve our left handed reliever
dialog: problem.
dialog: 
dialog: Unanimous approval from the scouts --
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOUTS (UNISON)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I should get Rincon?
speaker_heading: SCOUTS (UNISON)
dialog: Definitely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Okay. I'll also come back with Joe
dialog: DiMaggio and Ty Cobb. And who would like
dialog: a Fabergé egg? Guys, you aren't hearing
dialog: me -- in what universe can we afford
dialog: Rincon?
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I'm asking you guys to look at this game
dialog: differently than you've ever looked at it
dialog: before. I'm going to Cleveland.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 25.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: And when I come back, I want you to tell
dialog: me something I don't already know. I
dialog: want to question everything. We've got
dialog: to rethink this game.
dialog: As he exits --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY

dialog: since I've seen a five tools guy, the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTINEZ
dialog: Well, Billy, we're certainly looking
dialog: forward to meeting your folks and talking
dialog: to them as well. And we believe in
dialog: college, but that's something you can do
dialog: in the winter months. You need to know
dialog: the sky's the limit with your ability.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I work for a different team.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I know, but I'm the first person in
dialog: baseball who's ever talked to you this
dialog: long. Right? Why is Garcia undervalued?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay, truthfully, it might not be so easy
dialog: to explain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Really? Why's that Peter?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We might not see the game the same way.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Oh really? What do you mean by that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You've spent your life in baseball and I
dialog: don't have a very traditional view of the
dialog: game.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hey Pete, just say it. I'm not about to
dialog: beat you up. Say what you've always
dialog: wanted to say to a GM.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Baseball thinking is medieval. It's stuck
dialog: in the Dark Ages. I have a more
dialog: scientific view of the game.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Keep going, Peter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There is an epidemic failure within the
dialog: game to understand what's really
dialog: happening. And it leads people who run
dialog: major league teams to misjudge their
dialog: players and mismanage their teams.
dialog: They're still asking the wrong questions.
dialog: People who run baseball teams still think
dialog: in terms of buying players. Sorry to say
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Peter, don't apologize for what you
dialog: believe.
dialog: 34.
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The goal shouldn't be to buy players,
dialog: what you want to buy is wins. To buy
dialog: wins, you buy runs. You're trying to
text: replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look at
text: Johnny Damon and they see a star worth
dialog: seven point five million a year. When I
text: look at Johnny Damon, I see an imperfect
dialog: understanding of where runs come from.
scene_heading: SUDDEN CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: ARCHIVAL VIDEO: The back of Johnny Damon's A's jersey as
text: he walks to the plate to adoring Oakland fans.
speaker_heading: PETER V/O
dialog: His batting average is ignorable. What
dialog: matters is his on base percentage-
dialog: 
text: DAMON swings at the first pitch and knocks it into left
text: field for a single. He leads off first--
speaker_heading: PETER V/O
dialog: - which in 2001 was .324. That's 10
dialog: points lower than league average, and 17
text: points lower than Garcia's.
dialog: 
text: On the next pitch, DAMON takes off for second--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER V/O
dialog: True, he stole some bases. But attempted
dialog: steals in general have to succeed 70% of
dialog: the time before they even start to
dialog: contribute to run totals. In 2001 he cost
dialog: you runs.
text: DAMON's tagged out at second.
dialog: 
text: BACK TO THE GARAGE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He's got a good glove. He's a decent
text: leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's
dialog: not worth the seven point five million
dialog: Boston is paying him. You're lucky to
dialog: have him off your payroll, it opens all
dialog: kinds of interesting possibilities.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You read Bill James, Pete?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes. These ideas and this approach to the
dialog: game aren't all new. In fact, some of
dialog: them have been around for two decades.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: If this approach has been around for so
dialog: long, why isn't anybody in baseball doing
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That's a much more difficult question
dialog: than how to win baseball games. Once you
dialog: begin to pull at that string, your
dialog: understanding of the world might begin to
text: unravel.

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Billy? They're here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONGEWAARD
dialog: Billy... Good to see you again.
dialog: Obviously you're a very special player.
dialog: We'd like to compliment you on your high
dialog: school career, and we're looking forward
dialog: to you being a part of the Mets family.
text: Jongewaard sits at the kitchen table, speaking more to
dialog: Billy's parents than Billy himself --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONGEWAARD
dialog: There's good -- and there's premium.
dialog: Your son is premium. He has it all --
dialog: power, speed, the arm. The Look -- and
dialog: I'm never wrong about that. Which is why
dialog: this is a premium number.
text: He sets a contract on the table. Clipped to its top-
text: sheet is a check. On its left-hand corner is the Mets
text: insignia; on the right, the amount: $125,000. They all
dialog: see it. A lot of money in 1980. Silence. Then --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Billy's been offered a scholarship to
dialog: Stanford.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONGEWAARD
dialog: I know. And that's a great
dialog: accomplishment. I'm sure you're very
dialog: proud of him.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: So he can accept that, go there, and then -
dialog: -
text: Jongewaard is already shaking his head no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONGEWAARD
dialog: I understand how important college is. I
dialog: do. But what I can't do is burn a second
dialog: first-round draft pick on someone who
dialog: can't play for four years -- no matter
dialog: how good he is. Four years is ample time
dialog: for someone to get hurt. It happens all
dialog: the time. So, no. I'm sorry. It has to
dialog: be one or the other. To postpone four
dialog: years is four years he could be in big
dialog: leagues. The sooner he gets there the
dialog: sooner he can reap the benefits.
dialog: 
text: Stanford or The Money. Young Billy regards the check,
text: and then his parents. He really doesn't know what to do.
speaker_heading: JONGEWAARD
dialog: We're going to give him a different kind
dialog: of education. This won't be his life's
dialog: career, it'll be his first career. He's
dialog: going to be a young guy in the business
dialog: world when his baseball career is done.
dialog: He'll still have his whole life ahead of
dialog: him.

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It's Billy Beane.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't care. Would you have drafted me
dialog: in the first round?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: After I left you ran me through your
dialog: computer, right? Would you have drafted
dialog: me in the first round?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You were a good baseball player.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Would you have drafted me in the first
dialog: round?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I'd have drafted you in the ninth round.
dialog: No signing bonus. You'd have passed and
dialog: gone to Stanford.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Pack your suitcases.

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Good evening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Good evening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I asked you to do three.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: To evaluate three available players.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: And how many did you do?

speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: OKAY--

dialog: Here's the number of runs we'll need to

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Let's make sure we're on the same page.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We're going to re-think baseball.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Look for an inefficiencies in statistics.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Examine the ways that runs are scored and
dialog: prevented.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Exploit the fact that unspectacular runs
dialog: are just as valuable as 450-foot bombs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Unspectacular runs are more valuable.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER/BILLY
speaker_heading: (SIMULTANEOUSLY)
dialog: Because they cost less.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We believe there's a river that hasn't
dialog: been fished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We know it for sure.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: And because players have been overlooked
dialog: because they don't rise to the standards
dialog: of traditional baseball thinking, we
dialog: believe that in this river, there are
dialog: fish...fish who--
speaker_heading: (BILLY lost it)
dialog: Help me with--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Forget the fish. In this room is every
dialog: available player at every level of
dialog: professional baseball, and somewhere in
dialog: that group are 25 players that everyone
dialog: has else has thrown out.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 40.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
text: An island of misfit toys. In this room is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yes. But let me ask you this. If our
dialog: theory is right--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Math isn't a theory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: If it's right--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's right.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It sounds right.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It is right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: If math isn't a theory--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It isn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'm gonna punch you in the kidneys if you
dialog: don't let me finish a sentence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: If this is right, why isn't everybody
dialog: doing it? In fact, why isn't anybody
dialog: doing it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Somebody once said, "It's not what you
dialog: don't know that worries me it's what you
dialog: know for sure that's got me scared." In
dialog: the mid-19th Century in Budapest there
dialog: was an incredibly high instance of
dialog: mothers dying shortly after childbirth
text: from a disease called puerperal fever.
dialog: 35%.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Make this story less boring as soon as
dialog: you can.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A doctor named Semmelweiss showed that if
dialog: the attending physicians and nurses
dialog: sterilized their hands before delivery,
dialog: the mortality rate dropped to 1%.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: And he was vilified?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He was institutionalized. For suggesting
dialog: that washing your hands before putting
text: them inside someone else's body was a
dialog: good idea. High functioning people can
text: live under the spell of an inexplicable
text: mental lapse when they think as a group.
dialog: Why isn't anybody else doing it? Because
dialog: they don't think guys who look like you
dialog: are what win baseball games. They know it
dialog: for sure.

speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)

scene_heading: 27 INT. VIDEO ROOM - DAY 27

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hey, Art.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Can I talk to you a second before you get
dialog: started.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I got a lot to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: I know.
text: Whatever it is, Billy knows it can't be as dire as his
dialog: other problems, but also knows that to ignore Art would
dialog: be to insult him.
dialog: 
text: He gestures for Peter to go into the scouting room alone.
text: He'd rather not, but does. The scouts, assuming perhaps
text: he's there to make coffee, ignore him. He finds a place
text: to sit in a corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Who's the kid?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's Peter.
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: I can't manage this team under a one-year
dialog: contract.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Sure you can.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: No I can't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I've got to put a team on the field, then
dialog: I'll deal with your contract.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: How about you deal with the manager's
dialog: contract and then put a team on the
dialog: field?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: At the moment, if a ground ball is hit to
dialog: first base, nobody's going to be there to
dialog: stop it from rolling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: I have to tell you it's not easy doing
dialog: what I do under the cloud of a one-year
dialog: contract.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I know. I been there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: I know you have. And a 1-year contract
dialog: says the same thing to a manager as it
dialog: does to a player: There's not a lot of
dialog: faith there. Which is strange after a
dialog: 102-win season.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: If you lose the last one of the season
dialog: nobody gives a shit about the others.
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: It's on me now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It's on me, Art!

text: leafing through their printouts and notes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Submariner?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's the one. Technically an
dialog: underhander.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: What's his velocity?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Unimpressive.
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: About 85.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Does he have a good breaking ball?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Doesn't have one.

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Let's move on.
dialog: 
text: The scouts aren't sure what to say, and so say nothing.
scene_heading: EVENTUALLY -

dialog: have some ideas for what to do about
dialog: Giambi.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Knock me down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: We trade power for speed. A rabbit for a
dialog: gorilla - We go for an overachiever. A
dialog: big heart in the last year his contract.
dialog: Tend to play hard. We usually get a
dialog: pretty good year out of them. Make up
dialog: for some of the offense we lost.
dialog: (puts more names up)
dialog: Or the other option. Just a thought. We
dialog: go for a high-maintenance guy. A guy
dialog: that's a little difficult but talented.
dialog: A guy like Milton Bradley. Well, not
dialog: like Milton. Milton himself. Which do
dialog: you want to talk about first?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: None of them.
text: Grady looks like a man who can't take much more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You're still looking to replace him;
dialog: you're just saying it another way.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: We got some trades here.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We can't do it. What we can do is

speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: The (what) -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Giambi's on-base percentage was .477.
dialog: Damon's was .324. And Olmeda's - bless

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's what we're looking for. And
dialog: that's what we'll find. Three players
dialog: whose average OBP is -
speaker_heading: PETER
text: Three-sixty-four.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: That doesn't come out right.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You gotta carry the one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
dialog: Still don't look right.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It's right.

dialog: Yes.

dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Who's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's Peter.
dialog: And that's all he's going to tell them about Peter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I don't know how to say this delicately -
dialog: but does - Peter - need to be here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: POLONI
dialog: What's with this on base percentage
dialog: obsession? Is that Bill James bullshit?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You can call it Billy Beane bullshit for
dialog: all I care.
dialog: 
text: Billy takes a Marks-A-Lot, jots down three names on
text: strips, and approaches the board.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: So here's who we want. One.
dialog: 
text: He puts the first strip up. It reads: JEREMY GIAMBI.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Jason's little brother Jeremy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
text: He never comes home from the games.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLONI
dialog: Billy, if I may, he's had his problems on
dialog: the field -- not to mention his problems
dialog: off the field -- not to mention he's
text: getting a little thick around the middle
dialog: -- there's the stuff with the weed. He's
dialog: at strip joints...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: This guy could start the year with an
text: agent and end up with a parole officer
dialog: for Christ's sake.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: His on-base percentage is all we're
text: looking at now and he gets on base an
dialog: awful lot for someone who only costs
dialog: $285,000 a year.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
text: He can't catch a ball in the outfield.

dialog: moonlight.
text: Billy puts up another name: DAVID JUSTICE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: David Justice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Ten years ago he was a big name. He's
dialog: going to really help our season tickets
dialog: at the beginning of the year. But by
dialog: June he's not going to be hitting his
dialog: weight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PITTARO
dialog: He's 36!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTIE
text: His legs are gone. He's a defensive
dialog: liability. I question whether the bat
text: speed is still there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARRY
text: Steinbrenner is so pissed at his decline
dialog: he's willing to eat up half his contract
dialog: to get rid of him.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOPKINS
dialog: He's a fossil. With all due respect,
dialog: bringing these three guys aboard is like
text: putting bubble gum on a flat tire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: And why do we want to be the ones to bail
dialog: Justice out of his contract?
dialog: 
text: Billy points at PETER --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
text: He gets on base.
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: I got 37 free agents who are better than

speaker_heading: GRADY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's good news for us. He's cheap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRADY
dialog: Let me understand this. At first base
dialog: you want a guy who's been cut from half
dialog: of the minor league teams in the country
dialog: due to irreparable nerve damage?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He can't hit and he can't field, but what

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You do not.

speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Head problems.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: He's 37 and he's got three blown saves in
dialog: two weeks. Everytime he winds up he's
text: thinking he's about to throw the last
text: pitch of his life. So he grips it a
dialog: little hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: I appreciate this.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: But I know my bullpen.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yes you do. Yes you absolutely do. No

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 116.
dialog: 116.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: If we have a lead late in the game and

text: see Magnante out of the bullpen.
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: I'll make that decision when the time
dialog: comes.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's what you should do. Baseball's a
dialog: game of situations and you should make
dialog: the decision when the time comes. Except
dialog: you should make it now.
speaker_heading: ART
speaker_heading: LOOK--
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Don't bring Magnante out if we've gotta
text: hold a late lead with runners on. He's
dialog: 37, he's scared shitless of being the guy
dialog: who blows this winning streak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ART
dialog: You think a lot of yourself, don't you?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I......think the regular amount of
dialog: myself. Magnante on the other hand, he
dialog: doesn't think very much of himself at
dialog: all, and when he tightens up we've got
dialog: ourselves an adventure. So I'd like to
dialog: see Chad Bradford out of the pen tonight
dialog: when we're in, let's say, just to make it
dialog: easier for you, any situation.
dialog: Righty/lefty, two outs, no outs, the
dialog: umpires have decided we're going to
dialog: finish the game by playing darts,
dialog: whatever. Bradford's the first guy out of
dialog: the pen.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Okay?
dialog:

text: Through the tunnel, BILLY can hear the crack of the bat

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: PHILLIPS V/O
dialog: I heard the Giants --

dialog: No, the Giants want Venafro. And I told
dialog: them they can have him for Michaelson...
speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: ANDERSON --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: -- but I'd rather deal with you. Because

dialog: Yes, I understand it's impolite to keep

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS V/O
dialog: I'll think about it.

speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: (THINKS)
dialog: Invisibility.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That's what Casey said. Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: No.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Tell him I'll pay it, but when I sell him

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself,

speaker_heading: (back to BILLY)
dialog: We've got espresso, cappuccino, latte,

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's her birthday and I need to get her a
dialog: present but she's usually the one who
dialog: does that for me so do you have any
dialog: ideas?
speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: A scarf?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You mean like wool?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No I meant something that women wear
dialog: with, you know, a decorative --
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sure! Excellent.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: And where would I get something like
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: John, no disrespect, I just lost in five
dialog: for the second year in a row -- give her
dialog: a bowling ball for all I care.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Steve Schott told me he's offering you a
dialog: new contract.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yes he is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So why'd you return my call?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You're the Red Sox, and I think I can
dialog: help you.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 158.
dialog: 158.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I can do something about the
dialog: Curse of the Bambino. I heard you hired
dialog: Bill James.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Why it took someone so long to hire that
dialog: guy is beyond me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Because baseball hates him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Money buys a lot of things. One is the
dialog: luxury to disregard what baseball thinks.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: That must be nice.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: I was grateful to get your call.
dialog: 
text: JOHN looks at BILLY a moment...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You were grateful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: For 41 million you built a playoff team.
dialog: You lost Damon, Giambi, Isringhausen and
dialog: Pena and you won two more games without
dialog: them than you did with them.
text: And we begin a slow push-in on BILLY... this is the first
dialog: person in baseball other than his assistant who doesn't
dialog: think he's crazy.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You won the exact same number of games as
dialog: the Yankees but the Yankees paid 1.4
dialog: million dollars per win and you paid two-
dialog: hundred and sixty thousand. Yes, I want
dialog: you to be my General Manager.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I know you're taking it in the teeth.
dialog: The first guy through a wall always gets
dialog: hurt. But those are dying voices. Any
dialog: GM that doesn't tear down their team and
dialog: rebuild it using your model is gonna be a
dialog: dinosaur.
dialog: 
text: JOHN's taken a piece of paper out of his pocket and

dialog:

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What's this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: My first offer.

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Jesus. What the hell --
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sorry.

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: (THEN)

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Impressive.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're giving me Youkilis, Billy.

dialog:

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why would I ever do that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Come on Billy, Schott's going to want
dialog: something in exchange for letting you out
dialog: of your contract and I want Youkilis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Oh, what is that, your GM voice? You
dialog: can't have him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: And Cash. And a player to be named
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You already have my job. What else do you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't want your job.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why did you take it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You didn't leave me much choice.
speaker_heading: (THEN)

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It doesn't matter.

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Did he make you a good offer?

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It was fine.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What was it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It doesn't matter.

speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: (GENUINELY
speaker_heading: CONFLICTED)
dialog: Do I love the Red Sox?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don't know. I've never heard you say
dialog: you did.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: So why am I doing this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're not doing it for the money.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'm not?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're doing it for what the money says.
dialog: It says what it says to any player who
dialog: gets big money: that they're worth it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: The offer says that. The money itself is
dialog: redundant.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I made one personal decision based on
dialog: money in my life and I swore to never do
dialog: that again.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: So you're not going to Boston?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I haven't decided.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It's all over the news that it's a done
dialog: deal.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Look at this place. What a dump.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I so wanted to win here.
speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It's not much more than a home movie but

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Who is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The Visalia Oaks and their 240 pound
dialog: catcher, Jeremy Brown, who's scared of
dialog: running to second. This was in a game
dialog: six weeks ago.
dialog: 
text: PAUL hits the remote and the tape starts. The quality is
text: poor and the camera is focused only on Jeremy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This guy's gonna start him off with a
text: fastball low and in because he hasn't
dialog: read the book on our guy and doesn't know
dialog: that low and in is where he eats. Jeremy
dialog: takes him to deep center --
text: We see JEREMY BROWN connect and the ball fly off the bat
text: but the camera stays on JEREMY running to first. PAUL
text: slows down the picture with the remote
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: -- and he knows that if he runs it's a
text: stand-up double and he's running.
speaker_heading: BILLY
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Go pal.
dialog: 163.
dialog: 163.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And now he's gonna do something he never
dialog: does. He's gonna round first base, he's
dialog: gonna take the turn.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Please tell me he's safe at second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. Because right here --
dialog: 
text: JEREMY slips and stumbles to the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: -- is what he's always been afraid of.
dialog: It's all he can do to get himself back to
dialog: first.
text: JEREMY has been scrambling in the dirt to get safely back
dialog: to first base.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's the first base coach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why's he laughing? I'm gonna fire that
dialog: guy, why the hell is he --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Everybody's laughing.
dialog: 
text: JEREMY's looking around the field now, looking at his own
text: dugout. We can't see what he sees but he's confused.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And now Jeremy finds out why. Watch his
dialog: face because this is art. He's just
dialog: found out the ball went 60 feet over the
text: fence. He'd hit a home run but he didn't
dialog: know it.
dialog: 
text: And JEREMY's face explodes into a smile. He slaps hands
text: with the first base coach and begins his trot around the
dialog: bases.
text: BILLY stares at this. He takes the remote and backs it
text: up a little so he can see Jeremy's face again.

speaker_heading: PAUL
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: It was a metaph--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I know it was a metaphor.

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That was a hell of a baseball season,
dialog: boss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: The Island of Misfit Toys. Okay.
