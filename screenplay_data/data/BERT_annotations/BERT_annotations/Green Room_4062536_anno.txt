speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: ..-huh?
speaker_heading: PAT

text: Gas TRICKLES then POURS into the canister. Shared grins.
text: A metal CLANK. ECHOES from a cavernous interior.
text: Pat springs up and peers through the TINTED SUV WINDOWS,
text: seeing PARENTS corralling PEE-WEE HOCKEY PLAYERS from a rink

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: What are we doing?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Cover the gas. Get ready to run.
text: Sam hastily covers the gas canister with his jacket as the
text: SUV slows beside them. They look ahead, playing it not-so-

speaker_heading: HOCKEY MOM
dialog: Not safe, what you boys did...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (half-assed)
dialog: We didn’t do anything, ma’am.

speaker_heading: HOCKEY MOM

speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: We’re sorry.
speaker_heading: HOCKEY MOM
dialog: It’s dangerous. If you boys needed

speaker_heading: TAD
dialog: ..-working on anything new?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A few songs. Maybe enough for a
dialog: seven-inch.
speaker_heading: TAD
dialog: Sweet! Will you actually press one?
speaker_heading: REECE
dialog: If we can afford it.
speaker_heading: TAD
dialog: I dig the analogue style. Which
dialog: brings me to the fact: you guys are
dialog: hard to find. Why no social media
dialog: presence?
text: Pat contains a wince. Sam turns to face Tiger.
speaker_heading: REECE
dialog: Because booking more shows and
dialog: selling more records would blow.
speaker_heading: TIGER
dialog: It’s not hard-rock.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Says the one who gets smashed and
dialog: plays Darby Crash at the shows I
dialog: book on my phone...
text: Tiger looks to his plate, eats some eggs.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: No one wants to starve, but if you

speaker_heading: TAD
dialog: What do you mean, texture?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Just- you gotta be there.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Unless you’re Iggy Pop.
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: And good for him. I just don’t

speaker_heading: REECE
dialog: Tiger will. Right?
speaker_heading: TIGER
dialog: I won’t live to be seventy.
text: Reece and Sam blurt out mocking laughs, Pat drifts.
speaker_heading: TAD
dialog: Okay, so this is a good segue into
dialog: one of my traditions. For each of
dialog: you, name your ‘desert island’
dialog: band.
text: Reece rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: TIGER
dialog: Only one?
speaker_heading: REECE
dialog: If I were to say Black Sabbath,

speaker_heading: TAD
dialog: No caveats- just name the band.
text: Sam, Reece, Pat and Tiger size each other up...
speaker_heading: TIGER

speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Ah, man.
dialog: (rubs face)
dialog: Will this be edited?
speaker_heading: TAD
dialog: I'll chop it up a bit.
speaker_heading: TIGER
dialog: Let it go raw.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: When will this air? Shouldn’t we
dialog: plug the show?
speaker_heading: TAD
dialog: (thrown)
dialog: Yeah...
text: He turns off the recorder.
speaker_heading: TAD (CONT'D)
dialog: My last show at the muni center
dialog: didn’t end well. Lots of vomit.
dialog: Some fecal matter.
text: Tiger smiles.
speaker_heading: TAD (CONT'D)

dialog: Let’s not go to jail too.
dialog: (to Tad)
dialog: I think you just ended this tour.
speaker_heading: TIGER
dialog: Fuck yes. Let’s call it.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: TIGER
