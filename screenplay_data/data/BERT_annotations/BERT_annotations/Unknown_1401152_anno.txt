text: a CRASH of THUNDER -- the rain suddenly triples in

text: Martin sets down his case, moves to help the driver...
scene_heading: I/E. TAXI CAB - DAWN

speaker_heading: MARTIN
text: Tegel airport. Arrivals. Quick.

text: relax a little, enjoying this moment of forced calm.
text: He catches sight of the driver in the rear-view. Young,
text: female, shortish hair. Tomboy cute. Smart eyes, older than

text: She glances into the mirror, catches Martin watching her.
speaker_heading: GINA

text: THE SURFACE, starts to recede as the taxi slips underneath,

speaker_heading: SPIEGLER

dialog: Have you contacted your Credit

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No. You don't understand. As I

speaker_heading: BRESSLER

speaker_heading: MARTIN B

text: The mind is like a jigsaw puzzle.
dialog: The pieces fit together to create
dialog: the person we are. With major
text: trauma, the puzzle is shattered.
dialog: But the brain's ability to
dialog: recover is remarkable. The mind
dialog: needs a narrative, an identity...
dialog: a soul. Without memory, without
dialog: a past, we are nothing. In the
text: coma state, memories are rebuilt.
text: In some cases the pieces move.
dialog: In others they go missing. And
dialog: sometimes... completely new
text: pieces are found.
text: The bird flies off. Martin's eyes track... empty.

speaker_heading: JURGEN

speaker_heading: JURGEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sit down...
text: Points Martin toward a battered chair. opens a bottle of

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: That's where Spiegler worked for
dialog: you? The secret police?
speaker_heading: JURGEN

scene_heading: LATER -- SMOKE RISES FROM A CIGARETTE

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: I always have it with me. It was
dialog: a gift from my father...
text: Jurgen flips it open. Notices the inscription, the NUMBERS
text: written inside the front endpaper. A beat.
speaker_heading: JURGEN
dialog: These mean anything to you?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No. It's my wife's handwriting.
speaker_heading: JURGEN
dialog: So, they mean something to her.
text: He looks to Martin. Direct.
speaker_heading: JURGEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Her involvement in this. There
dialog: must have been something... in
dialog: the past... some indication?
text: A beat. Martin shakes his head, at a loss. Jurgen leafs

text: picks it up. Martin's notations from the night before in the
dialog: train: times... dates... places.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: My schedule... for this week.
dialog: It's everything I remember.

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Professor Bressler. He knows
dialog: everything...
speaker_heading: JURGEN
dialog: Including the fact that you were
dialog: going to have a random accident
dialog: that would allow him seamlessly
dialog: to take your place? These people
dialog: may be good, but they're not God.
dialog: The question is, why would they
dialog: want to take your place? What
dialog: could they gain from being you?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: They tried to kill me.
speaker_heading: JURGEN
dialog: Yes, did you a favor I'd say.
dialog: Now you have... Redlichkeit...
dialog: Now you know you are right.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Do you believe me?
text: A beat. Jurgen pours them both another brandy.
speaker_heading: JURGEN
dialog: In the Stasi, we had a basic
dialog: principle: Ask enough questions
dialog: and a man who is lying will
text: eventually change his story. But
text: a man who tells the truth cannot
dialog: change his, however unlikely his
dialog: story sounds. I believe you are

speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: JURGEN
dialog: Doctor Harris...

speaker_heading: JURGEN (CONT'D)
dialog: A loan against your guarantee.
speaker_heading: MARTIN

speaker_heading: JURGEN

speaker_heading: JURGEN
dialog: You said you had something.

text: 'Horticus', turns to the numbers on the end papers.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: These numbers, are a code. The
dialog: first number refers to the page
dialog: of a given book. The second to a
dialog: specific line on that page. The
dialog: third number to words on that
dialog: line. If I didn't have the exact
dialog: edition of the book, the code
dialog: would be unbreakable.
speaker_heading: JURGEN
dialog: (nodding, impressed)
dialog: And what do the numbers refer to?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: That's where it breaks down --

speaker_heading: JURGEN

speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: Help me with my bags, please.
text: The driver goes to fetch the case. Is stopped by its OWNER.
text: Raised voices. Moment's confusion. Then...
text: .the SQUEAL of TIRES. The taxi driver spins around to see

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What the hell Rod! You're my

speaker_heading: COLE

speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No... That's insane. Liz, she----
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: 'Liz'...? Your "wife"? How do

scene_heading: INT. TAXI CAB - SAME
text: Gina, driving through traffic, searching, no sign of the

scene_heading: EXT. TOP STORY PARKING GARAGE - SAME
text: Martin is tossed out onto the asphalt. Picks himself up,

text: Cole approaches, losing it now. Boiling with rage:
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: All that studying... planning.
dialog: Hell, you even had us take out
dialog: that kid after we ripped off his
dialog: thesis. A year of prep and you
dialog: try to screw it up... . we do

text: Smith covers Martin as Cole moves into the van, empties out a
dialog: junkie's works: dropper with needle, bottle top, cotton

speaker_heading: COLE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Wait! WAIT!

scene_heading: INT. CAFE ADLER - MOMENTS LATER
