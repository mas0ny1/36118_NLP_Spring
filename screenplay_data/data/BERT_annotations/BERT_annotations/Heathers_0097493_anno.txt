dialog: Daniel Waters
scene_heading: REVISED SECOND DRAFT
speaker_heading: Registered WGAW
dialog: November 17, 1987
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY
text: VERONICA SAWYER, a sullen seventeen year old beauty is
text: jogging down a suburban street in a stylish running outfit.
text: Evocative female voices can be heard, softly wailing.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--DAY
text: VERONICA lurches into a neighborhood park, running with an
text: increasing sense of desperation. The female voices wail louder.
scene_heading: EXT. PROMENADE--DAY
text: VERONICA whooshes past a series of shops and a movie theatre.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SAWYER HOME--DAY
text: Reveling in her own sweat and agony, VERONICA bounds onto
text: the lawn of her impressive upper middle class home.
text: She painfully rushes closer and closer to the front door as
text: the female moans swell to a deafening summit. The evocative
text: wailing cuts off as she grabs the doorknob.
scene_heading: INY. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY
text: VERONICA zips into a chic, but understated ensemble as she
text: launches into voice-over narration.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: Heather told me she teaches people
dialog: Real Life.
text: Composed and unsweaty, VERONICA fingers her bangs in the
text: mirror then rambles off.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY--DAY
text: Continuing her narration, VERONICA glides through a bustling
text: high school hallway with a frozen smile.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: She said Real Life sucks Losers dry.
dialog: If you want to fuck with the eagles,
dialog: you have to learn to fly.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE CAFETERIA
text: With her back turned to the viewer, VERONICA stands at the
text: outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. The viewer's viewpoint
text: approaches and finally curls around VERONICA to reveal that
text: she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: I said so you teach people how to
text: spread their wings and fly. She
dialog: said Yes.
scene_heading: THE DIARY PAGE
text: VERONICA'S pen sways across the diary page forming the words
text: echoed by her voice-over.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: I said You're Beautiful.
text: A sudden off-screen bark from HEATHER MCNAMARA causes the pen
text: to recklessly rocket across the written words.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)
dialog: God, come on Veronica!
text: VERONICA coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily
text: addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful,
text: trendily coiffed HEATHER MCNAMARA.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What's your damage, Heather? You
dialog: ruined my...
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me,
dialog: blame Heather. She told me to haul
dialog: your ass into the caf pronto. Back
dialog: me up, Heather.
text: From behind HEATHER MCNAMARA emerges a similarly trendily
text: accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, HEATHER DUKE.
text: She is clutching a tattered copy of "The Catcher in the Rye."
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CAFETERIA
text: VERONICA, flanked by HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE,
text: strides into the lunchroom pandemonium.
text: The stunning HEATHER CHANDLER turns from the tray before her
text: toward her incoming comrades. She is dressed stylishly and
text: expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (submissively)
dialog: Hello, Heather.
text: Pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, HEATHER
text: CHANDLER smiles. The content of what Heather says is
text: consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks
text: is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. She is a mythic bitch.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of
dialog: Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge
text: a hot and horny but realistically
text: low-key note in Kurt's handwriting
dialog: and we'll slip it into Martha
text: Dumptruck's lunch tray.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Shit, Heather. I don't have anything
dialog: against Martha Dunnstock.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: You don't have anything for her
dialog: either. Come on, it'll be Very. The
dialog: note'll give her shower nozzle
text: masturbation material for weeks.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'll think about it.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: (looking off)
dialog: Don't think.
scene_heading: POV ON CAFETERIA LINE
text: Unattractive and quite overweight, MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK
text: guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in line.
speaker_heading: CAFETERIA ENTRANCE
text: VERONICA's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the
text: outstretched pen.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Splendid. I'll dictate. Veronica
dialog: needs something to write on.
text: Heather, bend over.
text: Both HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE bend over. HEATHER
text: CHANDLER violently laughs.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: How nice. Two assholes: no waiting.
text: HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE stand erect, embarrassed.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
text: Heather Duke, back down.
text: VERONICA scurries to the contorting HEATHER DUKE.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Dear Martha, you're so sweet..
scene_heading: THE JOCKS' TABLE
text: The traditionally handsome KURT KELLY, the serene black EARL
text: FRAZIER and the massive RAM sit with other stereotypical
text: Jocks taking in VERONICA and the HEATHERS.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: It'd be so righteous to be in a
dialog: Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler
dialog: sandwich. Punch it in, Ram.
text: KURT and RAM raise their right arms and slam their fists
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: Hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on
dialog: my Johnson and just start spinning
dialog: her like a fucking pinwheel.
text: RAM makes a frantic spinning motion. EARL is bored.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Shit. Right.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: Damn right right.
speaker_heading: CAFETERIA ENTRANCE
text: In slow motion, VERONICA finishes the note and rises up
text: along with her makeshift desk, HEATHER DUKE.
text: HEATHER MCNAMARA hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line.
text: VERONICA hands the note to an impressed HEATHER CHANDLER.
text: MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK pays the CASHIER and then,
text: grasping her lunch tray with both paws, moves toward
text: VERONICA and the HEATHERS.
text: HEATHER MCNAMARA excitedly tugs on HEATHER CHANDLER'S arm as
text: MARTHA approaches. With a tranquil smile, HEATHER CHANDLER
text: passes the note to her frantic disciple.
text: In a self-consciously clandestine manner, HEATHER MCNAMARA
text: saunters past MARTHA then wields around to sneakily tuck the
text: note onto MARTHA's tray.
text: The slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles
text: past a magnetic preppie PETER DAWSON and a thin, black,
text: bespectacled DENNIS. The guys are working a large stand
text: which has a cashbox reading THE FAMINE FUND and a banner
text: reading WESTERBURG FEEDS THE WORLD.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Come on people, let's give that
dialog: leftover lunch money to people
dialog: without lunches! Those tater tots
dialog: you threw away today are a delicacy
dialog: in Africa! They're Thanksgiving dinner!
speaker_heading: HEATHERS' TABLE
text: The Girls reach their table with HEATHER MCNAMARA and
text: HEATHER DUKE sitting themselves down first.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: (looking to the stand)
dialog: God, aren't they fed yet? Do they
dialog: even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (low key sarcasm)
dialog: Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater
dialog: tots; it's a real party continent.
text: HEATHER CHANDLER draws up a clipboard.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Sawyer. Guess what today is?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So
dialog: what's the question?
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Yeah, so what's the question?
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: God-damn Heather, you were with me
dialog: in Study Hall when I thought of it.
dialog: Such a pillowcase.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: I forgot.
text: VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER briskly bop away from the table
text: as a wounded HEATHER DUKE retreats to The Catcher in the Rye.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hey, this question wouldn't be that
dialog: bizarro thing you were babbling
dialog: about over the phone last......
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he
dialog: gave me another topic that was
dialog: political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
text: VERONICA shakes her head and looks off. She's suddenly
text: captured by the sight of a JAMES DEANESQUE GUY sitting stark
text: in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a Rebel Without a
text: Cause lunchbox. They make eye contact.
text: Transfixed, VERONICA crashes into seated BETTY FINN, a slightly
text: overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sorry Veronica.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Betty Finn. Gosh.....
text: VERONICA crouches down, embarrassed and rueful.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm really sorry I couldn't make it
dialog: to your birthday party last month.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: That's okay. Your Mom said you had
dialog: a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip
dialog: my own birthday party for a date.
text: VERONICA gently laughs at BETTY's innocent awe.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Don't say that.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh Ronnie, you have to look at
dialog: what I dug up the other day.
text: BETTY pulls from her purse a picture showing a YOUNG BETTY
text: FINN AND VERONICA SAWYER, arm-in-arm, dressed in Halloween
text: costumes: BETTY is an angel, VERONICA is a witch.
text: VERONICA glows at the photo until HEATHER CHANDLER tows
text: VERONICA away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I was talking with someone!
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Color me impressed. I thought you
dialog: grew out of Betty Finn.
text: THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE
text: A coolly coed cabal of Country Club Kids icily eye the
text: approaching VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER. Country Club
text: kid COUTRNEY sourly speaks out.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Oh great. Here comes Heather.
scene_heading: COURTNEY'S FRIEND
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE
text: Alone at a table in the Siberia of the cafeteria, MARTHA
text: finishes a forkful of chicken. She spears her plate again
text: and brings the fork up. The note is wedged inside it.
text: THE COUNTRY CLUB KIDS' TABLE
text: HEATHER CHANDLER, Veronica in tow, hits the Country Club Kids
text: with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling smile.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh,
dialog: let me snare a tater.
dialog: COURTNEY express elation in spite of yourself as HEATHER
text: CHANDLER delicately takes a tot and turns around to face
text: VERONICA. HEATHER CHANDLER inserts her finger in her mouth
text: doing the "induce-vomiting" signal before devouring the tot
text: and turning back around.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Thanks. I just got it last night at
dialog: the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.
text: HEATHER CHANDLER raises her clipboard. VERONICA closes her
text: eyes and shakes her head with a half-smile.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: That's pretty very. Now check this out. You
dialog: win five million dollars from Publishers
dialog: Clearing House, but on the same day Ed
dialog: McMahon gives you the check, aliens
dialog: land on earth and say they're going
dialog: to blow up the world in two days.
dialog: What would you do?
text: A stunned tableau; until Country Club Kid KEITH speaks.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: That's easy. I'd just slide that wad
dialog: over to my father. He's like one of
dialog: the top brokers in the state.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Wake up. In two days, Earth's going
text: up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Man, in two days, my dad could
dialog: double my money. Triple it.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: If I got that money, I'd give it
dialog: all to the poor. Every cent.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're beautiful.
scene_heading: THE FAMINE FUND STAND
text: PETER reaches into the Famine Fund Box and takes some bills.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey
dialog: D.'s and get me a Big Mac and some fries.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: But that's the Famine Fund money.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, even Bob Geldof's got to eat.
dialog: If it makes you feel better, bag the
dialog: fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie.
scene_heading: CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE
text: HEATHER CHANDLER drags VERONICA down a cafeteria lane.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: If you're going to openly be a bitch....
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (submissive)
dialog: I'm sorry, it's just why can't we
dialog: talk to different kinds of people?
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I
dialog: look like Mother Theresa? If I did,
dialog: I probably wouldn't mind talking to
dialog: the Geek Squad.
text: She points to a table of unfashionably dressed and coiffed
text: students. Some wear glasses, some wear braces, some wear both.
scene_heading: THE GEEKS' TABLE
text: The GEEKS react to being pointed at. Their boney leader RODNEY
text: splatters milk over himself.
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: Did you see that? Heather Number
dialog: One looked right at us.
speaker_heading: BIG CYNIC
dialog: It must be love.
scene_heading: CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE
text: VERONICA confronts HEATHER CHANDLER.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Doesn't it bother you that everyone in
dialog: the school thinks you're a pirahna?
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Like I give a shit. They all want me,
dialog: as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped
dialog: at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Pretend you're a missionary saving
text: a colony of cootie victims.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: (giving in)
dialog: Whatever. I don't believe this. We're
text: going to a party at Remington University
dialog: tonight and we're brushing up our
dialog: conversation skills with the
dialog: scum of the school.
scene_heading: MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE
text: Her sweaty lips moving rapidly, MARTHA anxiously reads the note.
scene_heading: THE GEEKS' TABLE
text: The nervous GEEKS fidget and roughhouse each other in an
text: involuntarily immature reaction to their beautiful interviewers.
scene_heading: GEEK WITH BRACES
dialog: No seriously, I'd probably go to
text: the Pyrimads. With a girl.
scene_heading: GEEK WITH GLASSES
dialog: Where you going to get a girl, stud?
dialog: K-Mart?
speaker_heading: BIG CYNIC
text: Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on
dialog: the last day of Mankind. You
dialog: sentimental old fart.
speaker_heading: BRACES
dialog: Geez, forget it.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What about you Rodney?
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: (quietly to the others)
dialog: I told you she knew my name.
dialog: (beat of contemplation)
dialog: I'd change my life. New clothes.
dialog: New haircut. New house. New home.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: How sad! Blowing all your cash on
dialog: two days of trying to be hip.
text: VERONICA tugs HEATHER CHANDLER away from the table.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: If you're going to openly be a bitch....
text: VERONICA again catches sight of the JAMES DEANESQUE GUY.
text: He wraps his fingers around an egg and unfolds them back.
text: The egg is gone. He smiles. VERONICA smiles back.
text: Her trance is broken by a boisterous HEATHER MCNAMARA and
text: HEATHER DUKE who careen into the two pollsters.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: God, scan on Martha Dumptruck.
speaker_heading: POV ON MARTHA
text: MARTHA looks up from the note to the JOCKS' table and KURT
text: KELLY, then flustered, back down at the note.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: This is the part I hate. The waiting.
dialog: I'd say we're like twenty minutes from
dialog: major humiliation. Come on, Veronica.
text: HEATHER CHANDLER floats off. A disturbed VERONICA takes a
dialog: moment to react.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Veronica?
text: VERONICA follows the leader. She calls out.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Damn..
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT
text: VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER march into the school parking
text: lot toward four HEAVY METALERS (one female) hanging out on a
text: car hood. The girls' conversation is heard in voice-over.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: ..you Heather. Deep down all teenagers
dialog: are the same. Didn't you see The
dialog: Breakfast Club?
scene_heading: BETTY FINN'S TABLE
text: VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER set themselves down with BETTY
text: FINN and her LOOK-ALIKE FRIENDS.
speaker_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
dialog: Look at me. I look great. I'm the girl
text: in the commercials and the videos.
speaker_heading: JOCKS' TABLE
text: VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER warily stand at the outskirts
text: of the JOCKS' bastion of vulgarity.
speaker_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
dialog: I'm the blonde in the bikini on the
text: horse holding a Pepsi can.
scene_heading: INT. SMOKE-FILLED HALLWAY
text: In a dark, smoky hallway, VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER
text: cough toward a batch of STONERS in tattered forms of dress.
speaker_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
dialog: I'm the princess being spanked on the
text: throne by Billy Idol's guitarist's guitar.
scene_heading: INT. THE SCHOOL LIBRARY
text: VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER click-click across the school
text: library floor to where an ALL-OUT NERD studies in solitude.
speaker_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER (V.O.)
dialog: What do I get out of being friends
dialog: with losers. I give them a piece of
dialog: a winner and they stain me with loserness.
speaker_heading: PARKING LOT
text: Heavy Metaler MATT grins.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You get five million dollars but
dialog: some Martians are going to zap you
dialog: in two days. You hear that, Clyde?
dialog: That's got to be the most spooky-ass
dialog: question I've ever heard.
scene_heading: BETTY FINN'S TABLE
text: BETTY FINN daintily peeps up.
speaker_heading: BETTY FINN
dialog: I think we should use the money
dialog: for an End-of-the-world get-together.
dialog: We could invite guys.
speaker_heading: JOCKS' TABLE
text: RAM sputters out some chicken to bellow.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: I'd pay Madonna one million dollars
dialog: to ride my face like the Kentucky
dialog: Derby. She should be paying me, though.
scene_heading: STONERS' HALLWAY
text: A FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET starts to speak, then stops...
scene_heading: FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LIBRARY
text: The ALL-OUT NERD lashes out.
speaker_heading: ALL-OUT NERD
dialog: This is important. With taxes, I'd
dialog: be only getting 3.5 million and....
speaker_heading: PARKING LOT
text: Heavy Metaler CLYDE turns from his friend MATT.
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: If you want a good way to go out
dialog: before the aliens land, get a lion
text: from the zoo. Put a remote control
text: bomb up its butt. When the lion starts
dialog: tearing you up, press the bomb button.
dialog: You and the lion die like as one.
text: Two Heavy Metal lovers, JACKIE and STEVE, intertwined against
text: the windshield blankly respond.
scene_heading: JACKIE AND STEVE
dialog: Cool.
scene_heading: CAFETERIA THOROUGHFARE
text: VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER continue their conversation
text: chugging through another busy cafeteria lane.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Just imagine somebody like your
dialog: quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty
dialog: Finn doing a Crest commercial. No
dialog: one would buy Crest.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Don't tell me. Crest would be
text: stained with loserness.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
text: HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEATHER DUKE burst back between them.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Oh God, here we go...
scene_heading: POV ON MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK
text: MARTHA, with awkward apprehension, stumbles toward KURT and
text: the JOCKS. VERONICA and the HEATHERS stop breathing.
text: MARTHA mumbles something unintelligible from where the girls
text: stand. KURT'S head detonates with a terrifying cackle. MARTHA
text: flees the cafeteria in horror. VERONICA spins away from her
text: mirthful friends in disgust and makes eye contact with the
text: similarly disturbed JAMES DEANESQUE GUY.
text: VERONICA lurches away. She brakes against the Foodless Fund
text: stand where PETER DAWSON is hollering away.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: A dime increases the time! A buck
dialog: brings good luck! Hi Veronica. A
dialog: five keeps the neighborhood alive!
dialog: A ten and you die without sen!
text: HEATHER CHANDLER wings a twenty dollar bill into the cashbox.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: (to Veronica)
dialog: You wanted to become a member of
dialog: the most powerful clique in the
dialog: school. If I wasn't already the
dialog: head of it, I'd want the same thing.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: That episode with the note back
dialog: there was for all of us to enjoy,
dialog: but you're determined to ruin my day.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (slapping her knee)
dialog: We made a girl want to consider
dialog: suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Come on you jerk. You know you used
dialog: to have a sense of humor.
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS BATHROOM
text: Combing their hair in the bathroom mirror, the HEATHERS
text: speak in comically whining-and-pathetic imitations of Martha

scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
text: HEATHER DUKE's gentle off-screen voice slices in.
speaker_heading: HEATHER DUKE (O.S.)
dialog: Veronica, could you come back here?
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER AND HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Gross!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
text: A true friend's work is never done.
text: VERONICA reveals her right index finger is cut noticeably
text: short, then walks over to the stalls.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Color me nauseous.
speaker_heading: THE STALL
text: VERONICA stands in a tight stall with an ashamed HEATHER DUKE.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Maybe you should see a doctor.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Yeah, maybe.
speaker_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER (O.S.)
dialog: Come on Heather. We want another
dialog: look at today's lunch.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Geez, don't listen to them.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA (O.S.)
dialog: Did she have the pie or the ice
dialog: cream for dessert?
dialog: (like a game show host)
dialog: And the answer is.
text: HEATHER DUKE holds up her copy of The Catcher in the Rye and
text: makes a bizarrely defiant smile.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in
dialog: the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put
text: up with their bogus nonsense.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Well, you better move Holden out
dialog: of the way or he's going to get spewed.
text: HEATHER DUKE puts down her book and opens her mouth.
text: VERONICA sticks her finger in.
speaker_heading: CAFETERIA ENTRANCE
text: A gnarly melange of chicken and potatoes is scraped off a plate
text: into a cafeteria trashcan as VERONICA and the HEATHERS stroll
text: by outside. VERONICA pauses to peer in at the JAMES DEANESQUE GUY.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: God Veronica, drool much? His name's
dialog: Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Give me the clipboard.
text: As VERONICA walks off, HEATHER MCNAMARA oinks out some amusing
text: sexual noises.
scene_heading: CAFETERIA/JASON DEAN'S TABLE
text: VERONICA saunters to JASON DEAN.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hello Jason Dean.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Greetings and salutations. Call me
dialog: J.D. Are you a Heather?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, a Veronica. Sawyer. This may
dialog: seem like a stupid question....
dialog: J.D.
dialog: There are no stupid questions.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: If you inherit five million dollars
dialog: the same day aliens tell the earth
dialog: they're blowing us up in two days,
dialog: what would you do?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: (suavely)
dialog: That's the stupidest question I've

speaker_heading: JOCKS' TABLE
text: The JOCKS witness VERONICA and J.D.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: Who does that new kid think he is
dialog: with that coat? Bo Diddley?
speaker_heading: KURT
text: Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: Let's kick his ass.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old
dialog: for that crap. Let's give him a
dialog: scare though.
speaker_heading: J.D.'S TABLE
text: An intrigued J.D. laconically answers the question.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Probably just row on out to the

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: How very.
text: HEATHER CHANDLER breaks VERONICA's daze of admiration.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (to J.D.)
dialog: Later.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Definitely.
text: KURT and RAM move into the exiting VERONICA's place.
text: RAM sticks his finger through a piece of pie on J.D.'s plate.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: You going to eat this?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What did your boyfriend say when
dialog: you told him you were moving to
dialog: Sherwood, Ohio?
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: Answer him dick!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria
dialog: have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: It seems to have an open door policy
dialog: for assholes though, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: What did you say dickweed?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I'll repeat myself.
text: J.D. gracefully stands, reaches into his coat, and pulls out a
text: a .357 Magnum. He fires twice at the viewer.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY
text: Croquet wickets have been set up in standard form. VERONICA and
text: the HEATHERS stand at various positions in the yard holding
text: different colored mallets next to matching balls. HEATHER
text: CHANDLER knocks her ball through the middle wicket.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: God, they won't expell him. They'll
dialog: just suspend him for a week or something.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: He used a real gun. They should
text: throw his ass in jail.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No way. He used blanks. All J.D.
dialog: really did was ruin two pairs of
dialog: pants...Maybe not even that...
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: Can you bleach out urine stains?
text: HEATHER CHANDLER knocks her red ball into HEATHER DUKE'S
dialog: green one.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought
dialog: you were giving up on high school guys.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Never say never.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: What are you going to do, Heather?
dialog: Take the two shots or send me out?
text: The Girls look to the doelike HEATHER DUKE with incredulous faces.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Did you have a brain tumor for
dialog: breakfast? First you ask if you can
dialog: be red, knowing that I'm always red...
text: HEATHER CHANDLER places her foot on her red ball. She swings
text: her mallet down hard on the red ball sending the adjacent
text: green one rocketing into a flower bed.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Shit.
text: HEATHER CHANDLER's next shot falls short of the next wicket.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: (to HEATHER DUKE)
dialog: Damn. It's your turn Heather.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
text: No, it's Heather's turn.
text: HEATHER MCNAMARA hits her ball through a wicket and squeals.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Anyway, I can say never to high
dialog: school. I've got David.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: King David.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Maybe when you hit maturity you'll
dialog: understand the diff between a Remington
dialog: University man like David and a
dialog: Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam-
dialog: thank-you-maam" Sweeney.
text: HEATHER MCNAMARA misses her next shot.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Ram's sweet. Yo Heather, you're up.
text: HEATHER DUKE tries to navigate a shot from the flower bed.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: No way, no day!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Give it up girl!
text: As her friends howl, HEATHER DUKE slams her ball out of the
text: flower bed. The ball bounces off a tree and amazingly goes
text: through a wicket. HEATHER DUKE squeals in delight.
scene_heading: VERONICA HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Holy shit! God, that was unbelievable!
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: What. A. Shot.
text: HEATHER DUKE's next shot falls short of the next wicket.
text: VERONICA begins setting up her shot.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: So tonight's the night. Are you
dialog: two excited?
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her
dialog: first Remington Party. Blow it tonight
dialog: girl and it's keggers with kids all
dialog: next year.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (missing her shot)
dialog: Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've
dialog: been set up with? Witty and urbane
dialog: pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Don't worry. David says he's very
dialog: so he's very.
text: HEATHER CHANDLER again hits her ball into HEATHER DUKE'S.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Why?
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Why not?
text: HEATHER CHANDLER slams HEATHER DUKE's ball back into the
text: flower bed. VERONICA'S MOM calls out the back screen door.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Heather, your Mother's here.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Come on whoever wants a ride.
text: As the HEATHERS head into the house, VERONICA picks up HEATHER
text: DUKE'S ball and exuberantly throws it back toward the wickets.
text: Veronica's MOM, carrying a tray of pate, and DAD, carrying a
text: Robert Ludlum book, place themselves around a patio table.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Take a break Veronica, sit down.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: All right.
text: VERONICA sinks into the empty middle deck chair.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: So what was the first week of
dialog: Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Any contestants worth mentioning?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Maybe. There's kind of a dark
text: horse now in the running.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Goddamn. Will somebody please tell
dialog: me why I read this spy crap.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Because you're an idiot.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh yeah, that's it.
text: DAD immediately returns to reading with a wide grin.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: You two....
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Great pate, but I'm going to have
dialog: to motor if I want to be ready for
dialog: the party tonight.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE 7-11--NIGHT
text: A Volkswagen Cabriolet pulls up in front of a 7-11 with
text: HEATHER CHANDLER at the wheel. VERONICA pops out of the
text: car, into the store. HEATHER CHANDLER clamors to her.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Corn nuts!
scene_heading: INT. 7-11
text: Stylishly dressed-to-massacre, VERONICA reaches out to a bag
text: of Corn Nuts as J.D.'s off-screen voice disarms her.
speaker_heading: J.D. (O.S.)
dialog: You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, but if you're nice I'll let
dialog: you buy me a Slurpee. You know
dialog: your 7-11speak pretty well.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I've been moved around all my life;
dialog: Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood
dialog: Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any
dialog: town, any time, I can pop a Ham and
text: Cheese in the microwave and feast on
dialog: a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Really? That thing in the caf
dialog: today was pretty severe.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: The extreme always makes an
dialog: impression, but you're right, it
dialog: was severe. Did you say a Cherry
dialog: or Coke Slurpee?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I didn't. Cherry.
text: VERONICA smiles at her Coolness. J.D. returns the smile.
scene_heading: 7-11 PARKING LOT
text: VERONICA and J.D. slurp by J.D.'s ferocious motorcycle.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Great bike.
text: HEATHER CHANDLER sounds her car horn with a grimace.
text: VERONICA glares at her then turns back to J.D.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Just a humble perk from my Dad's
dialog: Construction company or should I
dialog: say Deconstruction company?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't know. Should you?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: My father seems to enjoy tearing
text: things down more than putting things up.
dialog: Seen the commerical? "Bringing every
dialog: State to a Higher State."
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's
dialog: Fred Dean Construction. Must be
text: rough. Moving place to place.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Everybody's life's got static. Is
dialog: your life perfect?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (gently joking)
dialog: Sure, I'm on my way to a party
dialog: at Remington University.
text: VERONICA grows serious as the car horn sounds again.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: It's not perfect. I don't really
dialog: like my friends.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I don't really like your friends either.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: It's like they're just people I
dialog: work with and our job is being
dialog: popular and shit.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Maybe it's time for a vacation.
text: The car horn blares again.
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY ROOM--NIGHT
text: DAVID, Heather Chandler's fine looking college beau, leads
text: VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER into a cramped, eclectically
text: tacky dorm room. Music pounds the door.
text: The semi-handsome BRAD leans aainst a desk while a WHINING
text: STUDENT talks with COED ONE who sits on the floor.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Throw your coats on the bed, girls.
scene_heading: WHINING STUDENT
dialog: That exam was so bogus.
speaker_heading: COED ONE
dialog: Oh I know. Which exam?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Veronica, this is Brad.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Excellent. Did you girls bring
dialog: your partying slippers?
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Yeah, let's party.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She loves to party.
text: As they head out the door, BRAD whispers something in
text: BRAD'S FRIEND's ear causing the pair to snarl off a laugh.
scene_heading: INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT
text: The viewer is taken back and forth from a shattered post-party
text: VERONICA to the traumatic dormitory party itself. The sobbing
text: monocled VERONICA writes at her desk.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Diary, I want to kill and you
dialog: have to believe.....damn pen!
text: VERONICA frenziedly scribbles, trying to get her pen to write.
text: She throws the pen across the room and pulls out another.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: You have to believe it's for more
dialog: than selfish reasons. More than a
dialog: spoke in my menstrual cycle. You
dialog: have to believe me.
scene_heading: DORMITORY HALLWAY
text: The chaotic hallway rumbles with beer cups and loud music.
text: VERONICA and HEATHER CHANDLER's stylish garb clashes with the
text: laid-back dress of the COLLEGE STUDENTS.
text: BRAD anxiously hands VERONICA a cup of beer as he watches
text: DAVID and HEATHER CHANDLER move through a staircase door.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: So, are you a cheerleader?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (dealing with a jerk)
dialog: No, not at all.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: You're pretty enough to be one.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Gee, thanks.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: It's so great to be able to talk
dialog: to a girl and not have to ask
dialog: "What's your major?" I hate that.
text: They uncomfortably sip their beers. A deadly pause ensues.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: So when you go to college, what kind
dialog: of subjects do you think you'll study?
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S DORM ROOM
text: HEATHER CHANDLER and DAVID sit on the latter's bed, surrounded
text: by a Macintosh and a series of obnoxious Ferrari posters.
text: They kiss. DAVID doing most of the work.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Come on David, let's go back to the party.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (unzipping his pants)
dialog: Don't worry, we will. You're just so
dialog: hot tonight. I can't control myself.
text: DAVID pushes HEATHER CHANDLER's head down.
speaker_heading: DORM HALLWAY
text: BRAD has given up on conversation.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: So what do you say we head up to my
dialog: room and have a real party. I've got
dialog: the best Windham Hill C.D. collection
text: in the dorm.
text: A BIG AMIABLE STUDENT approaches before VERONICA can show disgust.
scene_heading: BIG AMIABLE STUDENT
dialog: Brad-man, Robinson's looking for
dialog: you. He says he owes you for blow
dialog: and he just got some product himself.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: You're kidding. That pecker actually
dialog: scored something on his own?
scene_heading: BIG AMIABLE STUDENT
dialog: (ambling off)
text: He's in Sheila's room, guy. Party up.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Excellent. Veronica, ever do cocaine?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV
dialog: anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't
dialog: drinking and driving?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Hey, don't run away now.
text: With a wink, BRAD squirms off. VERONICA dashes into the room
text: with the coats.
speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM
text: VERONICA rampages through her diary.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: Seventeen is the last year Mom buys
dialog: the Twinkies. When you make the
dialog: jump from working weekends at Pizza
dialog: Hut to thirty years at I.B.M., you
dialog: lose something. Not innocence--power.
text: J.F.K. the cat jumps onto the Diary.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: J.F.K.!
text: VERONICA flings the screeching cat off and continues.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: Christ, I can't explain it, but I'm
dialog: allowed an understanding that my
dialog: parents and these Remington University
dialog: assholes have chosen to ignore. I
dialog: understand I must stop Heather.
speaker_heading: DORM "COAT" ROOM
text: Panting, VERONICA collapses at a desk in the "coat" room.
text: She draws a Vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours
text: some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair.
text: VERONICA lights a match from a 7-11 matchbook. She eerily
text: brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches.
text: With an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the Vodka
text: cup, setting it afire. VERONICA laughs to herself before
text: tossing the flaming cup out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE THE DORMITORY NIGHT
text: The flaming cup lands in a large rusted garbage can filled
text: with other cups and various refuse. The flames spread...
scene_heading: INT. DORMITORY BATHROOM NIGHT
text: A dejected HEATHER CHANDLER walks into a multi-mirror-and-sink
text: bathroom. Using a glass off one of the sinks, she gargles some
text: water and then spits it at her own reflection.
scene_heading: THE DORM "COAT" ROOM
text: VERONICA closes the window as BRAD opens the door.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: How's my little cheerleader? Now I
dialog: know everyone at your high school
dialog: isn't so uptight, come on.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hey really, I don't feel so great.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Let's do it on the coats. It'll
dialog: be excellent.
text: BRAD plops down onto the bed of coats and begins bouncing.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I have a little prepared speech I
dialog: give when my suitor wants more
dialog: than I'd like to give him....
dialog: Gee Blank, I had a nice....
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Save the speeches for Malcom X.
dialog: I just wanna get laid.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You don't deserve my fucking speech!
text: VERONICA yanks up her coat from beneath BRAD on the bed
text: causing him to slide off onto the floor.
speaker_heading: DORM HALLWAY
text: VERONICA storms into the hallway but slows down when she
text: sees she's attracting attention. She notices an incited
text: BRAD slither to the smiling DAVID who chats with some
text: STUDENTS, HEATHER CHANDLER on his arm.
text: BRAD causes DAVID's smile to ever-so-slightly diminish.
text: DAVID whispers to HEATHER CHANDLER who proceeds to set
text: down her beer and walk toward VERONICA.
scene_heading: DORMITORY ALLEY
text: The fire in the trashcan is raging.
speaker_heading: DORM HALLWAY
text: A steel faced HEATHER CHANDLER comes face-to-face with VERONICA.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: What's your damage? Brad says
dialog: you're being a real cooze.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Heather, I feel awful, like I'm
dialog: going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: No. Hell no.
text: VERONICA'S eyes fall shut in a near-faint. She flings
text: herself down off-screen with some ugly retching sounds.
speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM
text: VERONICA savagely scrawls in her diary, tears burning fierce.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: Betty Finn was a true friend and I
dialog: sold her out for a bunch of Swatchdogs
dialog: and Diet Cokeheads. Killing Heather'd
dialog: be like offing the Wicked Witch of the
dialog: West. Or is it East? West! I sound
dialog: like a psycho. Tomorrow I'll be kissing
dialog: her aerobicized ass but tonight let me
dialog: dream of a world without Heather. A
dialog: world where I am free.
speaker_heading: DORM HALLWAY
text: VERONICA rises into view with tinges of vomit on her mouth.
text: A smile breaks across HEATHER CHANDLER's granite puss.
text: VERONICA runs off as STUDENTS laugh in the background.
scene_heading: DORMITORY ALLEY
text: VERONICA charges into the alley. She whips around to face a
text: screeching HEATHER CHANDLER. In back of VERONICA, the
text: trashcan bellows like Mt. Vesuvius.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: You stupid cunt!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You goddamn bitch!
text: The flickering flames cast HEATHER CHANDLER in a demonic light.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: You were nothing before you met me!
dialog: You were playing Barbies with Betty
dialog: Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a
dialog: Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout
dialog: Cookie! I got you into a Remington
dialog: Party! What's my thanks? It's on the
dialog: hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: (totally in control)
dialog: Monday morning, you're history. I'll
dialog: tell everyone about tonight. Transfer
dialog: to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson.
dialog: No one at Westerburg's going to let
dialog: you play their reindeer games.
speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM
text: VERONICA flings her diary across the room where it hits the
text: wall behind the stunning figure of J.D. VERONICA gasps.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (exhaling deeply)
dialog: S'okay....
dialog: J.D.
text: I saw the croquet set-up in the back.
dialog: Up for a match?
text: VERONICA is simultaneously dismayed and exhilarated. She seems
text: ready to burst out all her anxieties but instead....
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Sure. But I'm Blue.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SAWYER BACKYARD--LATE NIGHT
text: The viewer's viewpoint glides through the grass of Veronica's
text: backyard uncovering combinations of wickets and articles of
text: clothing. A pair of girls shoes and a pair of guys shoes rest
text: together by the first wicket.
speaker_heading: J.D. (V.O.)
dialog: Goddamn, no wonder you looked so
text: mangled when I came through the window.
text: Feminine socks and masculine socks lay crumpled by the next wicket.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: I've always treated Heather's teen
dialog: queen power plays as bullshit.....
text: As VERONICA quiveringly pauses, a stylish blouse and a
text: rugged shirt are revealed mingling by another wicket.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: But I'm really scared. Who am I going
dialog: to eat lunch with on Monday? I sound
text: like an Afterschool Special.
text: The viewer's viewpoint moves to a dress and a pair of jeans
text: resting side by side at another wicket.
speaker_heading: J.D. (V.O.)
dialog: That was my first game of Strip
dialog: Croquet, you know. I thank you.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: You're welcome. It's a lot more
dialog: interesting than just flinging
dialog: off your clothes and boning away
text: on the neighbor's swing set.
text: VERONICA'S blue mallet has been staked into the ground. Her
text: panties hang on one end, J.D.'s underwear hangs on the other.
speaker_heading: J.D. (O.S.)
dialog: Well, I don't know. There's
dialog: something to be said for...Ouch!
text: VERONICA and J.D. are finally revealed, entangled in an
text: artful pose upon J.D.'s gunslinger coat. They warmly kiss.
text: VERONICA breaks off to uneasily giggle.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What a night.
text: J.D. gently bites in to VERONICA's neck. VERONICA grooves on
text: it, closing her eyes tightly.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What a life. I almost moved into high
dialog: school out of sixth grade because I
dialog: was some genius. We all decided to
dialog: chuck the idea because I'd have
dialog: trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah.
text: VERONICA slides her head down against J.D.'s chest and
text: gracefully rests on his lap. Gently fighting slumber, she
text: murmurs up to J.D., who showers her face with slow kisses.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use
dialog: my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss
dialog: to wear and how to hit three keggers
text: before curfew. Some genius.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Heather Chandler is one bitch that
dialog: deserves to die.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Killing her won't solve anything.
dialog: J.D.
text: A well-timed lightning bolt through
dialog: her window and Monday morning, all
dialog: the other heathers, shit, everybody
dialog: would be cast fucking adrift.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Well then, I'll pray for rain.
dialog: J.D.
text: See the condoms in the grass over
dialog: there. We killed tonight, Veronica.
dialog: We murdered our baby.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: There's a big difference between
dialog: the most popular girl in the school
text: and dead sperm.
text: They laugh. VERONICA maneuvers herself into a sitting position.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I guess I don't know what the hell
dialog: I'm talking about.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I know exactly what the hell you're
dialog: talking about and you're right, you
dialog: don't know what the hell you're
dialog: talking about. Let's just grow up,
dialog: be adults, and die.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Good plan.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: But before that, I'd like to see
text: Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
scene_heading: INT. HEATHER CHANDLER'S BEDROOM--DAY
text: HEATHER CHANDLER's bedroom is lushly and expensively
text: furnished with a glass coffee table as an eye-catching
text: centerpiece. HEATHER CHANDLER half-sleeps in twisted
text: bedsheets as MRS. CHANDLER sticks her head in the door.
scene_heading: MRS. CHANDLER
dialog: We are leaving soon for your
dialog: grandmother's. If you care to join us...
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Bag that.
scene_heading: MRS. CHANDLER
dialog: Is that a "No" in your lingo?
text: As the door closes, HEATHER CHANDLER raises her arm and
dialog: gives her departed Mother "the finger."
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Lingo this.
scene_heading: INT. THE CHANDLER KITCHEN--DAY
text: The sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before
text: VERONICA and J.D. burst through the door.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Trust me. She skips the Saturday
dialog: morning trip to Grandma's even
text: when she's not hungover.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Then let's just concoct ourselves a
dialog: little hangover cure that'll induce
text: her to spew red, white, and blue.
text: VERONICA opens the refrigerator. J.D. opens the cupboard
text: beneath the sink.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What about orange juice and milk?
dialog: What's the upchuck factor on that?
text: J.D. holds up a bottle of Pine-Sol.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Don't be a dick. That stuff'll
dialog: kill her.
text: VERONICA and J.D. make queasy eye-contact. VERONICA descends
text: back into the refrigerator with some worked-up enthusiasm as
text: J.D. suavely pours bits of various toxic containers (detergent,
text: scouring powder) into a glass beer mug.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put
dialog: it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it
dialog: be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Man Veronica, pull the plug on that
dialog: shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
text: J.D. raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue
text: liquid. VERONICA stares at the glass, scared by her own thoughts.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: What are you doing? You just
dialog: can't go.....Besides, she'd never
dialog: drink anything that looks like that.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Okay we'll use this. She won't be
text: able to tell what she's drinking.
text: J.D. pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the
text: poisonously blue beer glass contents into it. An eerie pause
text: ensues. VERONICA takes out a milk carton and a container of orange
text: juice. She struts back to the counter in anger, icily muttering.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Just give me a cup, jerk.
text: J.D. sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup. VERONICA
text: tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange
text: juice into the cup.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe
dialog: we could cough a phlegm globber in
dialog: it or something.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Yeah, great.
text: They both start coughing harshly.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll
dialog: do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Chick-en.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're not funny.
text: J.D. turns on his heel and slinks away. VERONICA glares down at
text: the mess of toxic containers. With both arms, VERONICA clumps
text: the toxic containers together and drops beneath the sink to put
text: them away. J.D. swaggers back into the kitchen as VERONICA bobs
text: back into view.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: J.D. kisses the back of her neck. VERONICA closes her eyes
text: with a grudging smile.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Bonehead.
text: VERONICA dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups.

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Morning, Heather.
text: Like a lion, HEATHER CHANDLER rouses herself up.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle
dialog: surprise. Hear about Veronica's
dialog: affection for regurgitation?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: We both said a lot of things we
dialog: didn't mean, last night.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Veronica knew you'd have a hangover.
dialog: So I whipped this up. Family recipe.
text: J.D. holds out the ceramic cup. HEATHER CHANDLER snorts.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Did you put a phlegm globber in it
dialog: or something? I'm not drinking that piss.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I knew this stuff would be too intense.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Intense? Grow up. You think I'll drink
dialog: it just because you call me chicken.
dialog: They do. They're right.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Just give me the cup, jerk.
text: HEATHER CHANDLER rises from the bed and struts to J.D. in anger.
text: She takes the cup, slams her head back and downs it all. She then
text: launches her head forward, her face contorted in agony.
scene_heading: HEATHER CHANDLER
dialog: Corn nuts!
text: HEATHER CHANDLER'S eyes slam shut and her limp body crashes
text: through the glass coffee table. VERONICA and J.D. freeze.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Something tells me you picked up
dialog: the wrong cup.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No shit, sherlock. I can't believe
dialog: it. I just killed my best friend.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: And your worst enemy.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
text: VERONICA staggers to a desk. J.D. laughs out of shock.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: What are we going to tell the cops?
dialog: "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Stop kidding around. I'm going to
dialog: have to send my S.A.T. scores to
dialog: San Quentin instead of Stanford.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I'm just a little freaked, all right?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You got what you wanted, you know.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: It's one thing to want somebody out
dialog: of your life. It's another thing to
text: serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
text: VERONICA stares off as J.D. paces like a caged animal. He
text: scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees
text: Cliff Notes for The Bell Jar plus a magazine proclaiming
text: "THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN TEEN" sticking out from beneath
text: HEATHER CHANDLER's body.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime.
dialog: But if this was like a suicide thing.....
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Like a suicide thing?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Adolescence is a period of life
text: fraught with anxiety and confusion.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (calming down)
dialog: I can do Heather's handwriting as
dialog: well as my own.
text: VERONICA takes some stationery from the desk and begins
text: writing, calling out her words.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: "You might think what I've done is
dialog: shocking..."
dialog: J.D.
dialog: "To me though, suicide is the
dialog: natural answer to the myriad
dialog: of problems life has given me."
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: That's good, but Heather would
dialog: never use the word "myriad."
dialog: J.D.
dialog: This is the last thing she'll ever
dialog: write. She'll want to cash in on as
dialog: many fifty-cent words as poss.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: She missed "myriad" on a vocab
dialog: test two weeks ago, all right?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: That only proves my point more. The word
text: is a badge for her failures at school.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're probably right..."People think
dialog: just because you're beautiful and
dialog: popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody
dialog: understood I had feelings too."
dialog: J.D.
dialog: "I die knowing no one knew the real me."
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: That's good. Have you done this before?
text: VERONICA's smile dies as she looks to HEATHER CHANDLER'S corpse.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY
text: At the head of a long conference table is the bearlike
text: PRINCIPAL GOWAN. Circling the table is the gray-haired but
text: savvy MRS. POPE, the black counselor PAUL HYDE, the yuppie math
text: teacher KEVIN STAPLES, and most noticeably, the eccentrically
text: dressed MS. PAULINE FLEMING. Coats are in chairs and cigarette
text: smoke is in the air, as the group batters their way through a
dialog: morning mourning conference.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL GOWAN
dialog: Any other Principal would take the same
dialog: position. Keep things business as usual.
speaker_heading: COUNSELOR HYDE
dialog: Heather Chandler's not your everyday
dialog: suicide. She was very popular.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL GOWAN
dialog: I let the kids go before lunch and
text: the switchboard'll light up like a
dialog: Christmas Tree.
speaker_heading: KEVIN STAPLES
dialog: The parents will be sympathetic, sir.
dialog: These are troubled times for the young.
speaker_heading: MRS. POPE
dialog: I must say I was impressed to see
dialog: that she made proper use of the word
dialog: "myriad" in her suicide note after
text: brutalizing it in a vocabulary test.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: (dramatically cutting in)
dialog: I find it profoundly disturbing that
dialog: we are told of a tragic destruction
dialog: of youth and all we can talk about
dialog: is adequate mourning times and
dialog: misused vocabulary words.
text: A collective sigh goes across the room.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL GOWAN
dialog: Oh Christ.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: The school, meaning both students
dialog: and teachers, must revel in this
dialog: revealing moment. I suggest we get
text: everyone into the cafeteria and
dialog: just talk. And feel. Together.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL GOWAN
dialog: Thank you, Ms. Fleming. Call me
dialog: when the shuttle lands...Now is
dialog: this Heather the cheerleader?
speaker_heading: COUNSELOR HYDE
dialog: That would be Heather Mcnamara.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL GOWAN
dialog: Damn. I'd be willing to go half a
dialog: day for a cheerleader.
speaker_heading: KEVIN STAPLES
dialog: Let's just pack it in an hour early.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL GOWAN
dialog: Done. I hate Mondays.
scene_heading: INT. PAULINE FLEMING'S CLASSROOM--DAY
text: The desks of the classroom have been maneuvered into an
text: amusingly chaotic position by PAULINE'S PUPILS. She is furious.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget
dialog: it! Just sit down. I'm just so thrilled
dialog: to be given an example of everything
dialog: I've taught you. That example is
dialog: Heather Chandler. I have the note!
text: PAULINE melodramatically lifts the suicide note. The class AAAHS.
speaker_heading: MALE STUDENT
dialog: All right!
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'll pass the suicide note around
dialog: the room so you can feel its tragic
dialog: beauty for yourself. Let us share
dialog: together the feelings the suicide has
dialog: spurred in us all. Who wants to begin?
speaker_heading: FEMALE STUDENT
dialog: I heard it was really gnarly. She
dialog: drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and
dialog: stuff then she smashed....
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Now, now, we're not here to rehash
dialog: the coroner's report. Let's talk emotions.
scene_heading: THE ALL-OUT NERD
dialog: Are we going to be tested on this?
text: A stunned PAULINE glares until preppie PETER DAWSON speaks.
text: The note continues to be breathlessly passed around.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Heather and I used to go together,
dialog: but she said I was boring. I realize
dialog: now I wasn't really boring. She was
text: just dissatisfied with her life.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: That's very good Peter.
text: VERONICA lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by
text: putting her hands over her face.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Dear Veronica, Heather was your
dialog: soulmate.....Share.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Heather was cool, but cruel. The good
dialog: looks and bad manners gave her power,
dialog: but it could not give her happiness.
text: The class stares to VERONICA as the suicide note is passed to
text: her. She acknowledges it in horror, passes it on, then continues,
text: realizing her ability to create truths for a captive audience.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: She realized the only way she could
dialog: be happy was to give up her power and
dialog: the only way she could do that was death.
text: PAULINE cries. The PUPILS applaud. VERONICA queasily smiles.
scene_heading: INT. THE GIRLS LOCKER ROOM--DAY

text: HEATHER DUKE gnaws on a chicken leg as she speaks.
speaker_heading: VERONICA

speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: (belching)
dialog: Fuck it.
text: HEATHER MCNAMARA pulls a Swatch from one of the lockers.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Look, heather left behind one of her
dialog: Swatches. She'd want you to have it,
dialog: Veronica. She always said you couldn't
dialog: accessorize for shit.
text: HEATHER MCNAMARA tosses the watch to a spooked VERONICA who
text: stands up and solemnly puts it on. The FEMALE STONER IN ARMY
text: JACKET stops next to their bench.
scene_heading: FEMALE STONER IN ARMY JACKET
dialog: I'm sorry about your friend. I thought
dialog: she was your usual airhead bitch.
dialog: Guess I was wrong. Lot of us were.

speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA

speaker_heading: SQUEALING GIRL

scene_heading: INT. THE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: Let's see some pussy!
text: MATT pulls a curtain revealing a semi-overhead view of the

speaker_heading: THE SHOWER

scene_heading: THE GIRLS' COACH'S LOCKER ROOM OFFICE
text: Cautiously quiet pandemonium.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Does this have something to do with

speaker_heading: CLYDE

speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Oh God, Veronica. My hair! My clothes!
text: HEATHER MCNAMARA moans, vibrates, then suddenly races toward

scene_heading: INT. THE DEAN LIVING ROOM--LATE AFTERNOON
text: A massive T.V. set shows the image of HEATHER DUKE

speaker_heading: HEATHER DUKE (T.V.)

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Yeah. Scary stuff.

dialog: J.D.
dialog: Why son, I didn't hear you come in.
text: J.D.'s father FRED DEAN, stands before them, handsome

speaker_heading: FRED DEAN
dialog: Hey Dad, how was work today?
text: FRED DEAN slams down his rowing machine and straddles it
text: before answering his own question. He rows as he speaks.
text: The Brady Bunch sputters on the T.V. screen before him.
speaker_heading: FRED DEAN
dialog: It was miserable. Some damn tribe of

dialog: to terminate that fleabag hotel. All

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (awkwardly standing)
dialog: My Mom's making my favorite meal

speaker_heading: FATHER RIPPER (O.S.)
dialog: I blame not Heather but rather a

dialog: J.D.
dialog: Another fucking Heather.
dialog: (harshly laughs)
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior
dialog: tonight. Seven high schools in seven
dialog: states and the only thing different
dialog: was my locker combination. We've broke
dialog: through the peer pressure cooker. So
dialog: what if we had to kill Miss Popularity..
text: VERONICA clumsily high heels it up the hill.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.

text: takes his hand. Their bodies disappear over the hill.

scene_heading: INT. NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY
text: In a cluttered school workshop, Editor DENNIS and a YEARBOOK
text: GIRL, wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, confer over a layout sheet.
text: Dennis's Famine Fund partner PETER DAWSON pouts behind them.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: I'm not belittling the Famine Fund
dialog: Peter, but we're talking teen suicide!
dialog: Westerburg finally got one and I'm
dialog: not going to blow it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Great. Heather gets the headline and I
text: get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.
text: VERONICA breezes in.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hi Guys. I came to check on this
text: week's lunchtime poll topic.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Don't worry about it, Veronica,
dialog: sit down. That funeral yesterday
dialog: must have been really rough.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh. Sure.
speaker_heading: YEARBOOK GIRL
dialog: We were, uh, wondering if maybe you
dialog: had some poems or artwork that
dialog: Heather did that we could put in
dialog: the Heather Chandler yearbook spread?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: YEARBOOK GIRL
dialog: Take a look. We'll have a two page
dialog: layout with her suicide note up
text: here in the right hand corner.
speaker_heading: DENNIS
text: It's more tasteful than it sounds.
text: Country Club COURTNEY and COURTNEY'S FRIEND come in giggling
text: and whispering. Seeing VERONICA, they stop dead, then slide
text: into chairs, laughing softly.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't know. This thing leaves a
dialog: bad taste in my mouth.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: Like last night, Veronica?
text: COURTNEY and COURTNEY'S FRIEND explode in laughter.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm sorry? I don't get it.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: You did last night.
text: More laughter.
scene_heading: COURTNEY'S FRIEND
dialog: Kurt told us of your little date.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Yeah. And? I left him drunk and
text: flailing in cowshit.
speaker_heading: COURTNEY
dialog: I don't know. He was really detailed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Shut up, Courtney.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Don't shut up. I'd like to know just
dialog: what I did.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (gesturing to the door)
dialog: Let me show you that lunchtime
dialog: poll topic, Veronica.
text: HALLWAY OUTSIDE WORKSHOP
text: PETER tells VERONICA.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I rarely listen to Neanderthals like
dialog: Kurt Kelly bu-ut he said you were
text: bent over like a coffee table with
text: Kurt going in one end and Ram coming
dialog: in the other. Pardon the pun.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (dazed)
dialog: Pardon the pun. Son-of-a-bitch.
text: Dizzy, VERONICA hands a clump of dollar bills to PETER.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Thanks Pete, for the Famine Fund.
text: PETER cheerfully pockets the cash as VERONICA drifts off.
scene_heading: INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--DAY
text: VERONICA arousingly speaks into her phone.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I
dialog: didn't expect to be calling either. I
dialog: guess my emotions took over. I was
dialog: wondering if you wanted all those
dialog: things you've been saying to really
dialog: happen. It's always been a fantasy of
dialog: mine to have two guys at once......
dialog: Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum.
text: Revealed to be lounging on her bed, J.D. laughs out loud.
text: VERONICA throws a book at him.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: That's right, tonight. In the woods
dialog: behind the school. Don't forget Ram.
scene_heading: INT. THE KELLY KITCHEN--DAY
text: KURT hangs up with an amazed expression on his face.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Women.
speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM
text: VERONICA and J.D. load guns on VERONICA's bed. VERONICA
text: breaks into a laugh.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I don't get the point of me writing
dialog: a suicide note when we'll just be
text: shooting them with blanks.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Get crucial. We won't be using
text: blanks this time.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You can't be serious? Hey listen,
dialog: my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
text: VERONICA drops her gun in revulsion and launches off her bed.
text: With a patient smile, J.D. pulls her back down.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Do you take German?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: French.
text: J.D. flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: These are Ich Luge bullets. My
text: grandfather snared a shitload of
dialog: them in W.W. Two. They're like
dialog: tranquilizers only they break the
dialog: surface of the skin, enough to
dialog: cause blood, but not any real harm.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: So it looks like the person's been
dialog: shot and killed when they're really
text: just unconscious and bleeding.
text: J.D. nods then stands to pace the room, his mind whirring.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look
text: like they shot each other. By the time
text: Kurt and Ram regain consciousness,
dialog: they'll be the laughingstock's of the
dialog: school. The note's the punchline.
dialog: How'd it turn out?
text: VERONICA clumsily extracts the note from her purse. She also
text: plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of Kurt's handwriting of
text: the opening note-forge scene. She proudly displays both
dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: First tell me this similarity is
dialog: not incredible.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: (warmly)
dialog: Incredible similarity.
text: VERONICA pulls back the note and reads.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Ram and I died the day we realized
dialog: we could never reveal our forbidden
text: love to an uncaring and ununderstanding
dialog: world. The joy we shared in each other's
dialog: arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet
dialog: we were forced to live the lie of Sexist-
dialog: Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Exquisite, but I don't think
dialog: ununderstanding is a word.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: We don't want to make them out to be
dialog: too secretly eloquent. Why would the
dialog: Germans invent a bullet that doesn't
dialog: kill people? I mean it was World War
text: Two, not a school play.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: (rapid-fire)
dialog: They used them on themselves to
dialog: make it look like they were dead.
dialog: Really quite a brilliant device, but
text: too flamboyant to seriously produce.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
text: VERONICA swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable
text: tabby entering the room. J.D. rips it away from her.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: It doesn't work on small animals!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Uh well hey, let's take a look at the
dialog: homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now,
text: prepare to be a little disappointed.
text: J.D. lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the
text: contents on the bed.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a
text: Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You must have had fun.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot.
dialog: The one perfecto thing I picked up...
text: J.D. reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly
text: raises out two bottles of Perrier water.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Perrier water!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh come on. Lots of people drink
dialog: Perrier. It's come a long way.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: This is Ohio. If you don't have a
dialog: brewsky in your hand after dark you
dialog: might as well be wearing a dress.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (mock-seductively)
dialog: Oh, you're so smart. How about a
dialog: little heterosexuality before we go?
text: J.D. laughs then climbs onto VERONICA for a hugging kiss.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT--NIGHT
text: A tense KURT and an excited RAM, playing air guitar, walk
text: through the parking lot toward the woods.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever
dialog: need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello
dialog: Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Shut the fuck up, all right.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: Lighten up, dude. In those woods is
dialog: some of the finest pussy in the school
dialog: and we don't even have to buy it a
dialog: hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
text: KURT feebly slams knuckles with RAM.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING IN THE WOODS--NIGHT
text: VEONICA stands in the middle of a clearing in the woods.
text: She nervously tucks the gun in the back of her dress as KURT
text: and RAM emerge into the clearing from a path in the woods.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Hi Veronica.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (forced cheerfulness)
dialog: Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.
text: RAM smacks his hands together.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: So do we just start fucking?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I've made a circle on each end of
dialog: the clearing. Ram, you come over here.
text: KURT steps into the scratched-in-the-dirt circle next to him.
text: A confused RAM walks past VERONICA and steps into a circle at
text: the opposite end of the foggy clearing.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: When you get in the circle, strip.
text: The guys pause, then slowly start taking off their clothes.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I was hoping you'd rip my clothes
dialog: off me, sport.
speaker_heading: RAM
dialog: Oh. Good idea.
text: KURT and RAM awkwardly stand at opposite ends in their undies.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Count of three, guys.
text: RAM giggles in anticipation.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: One.
text: KURT finally cracks a smile.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Two.
text: J.D. suddenly moves next to VERONICA holding a gun in his
text: right hand and the feminine shopping bag in his left.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Three.
text: J.D. almost non-chalantly shoots RAM in the forehead.
text: VERONICA rips out her gun and swings it toward KURT. Using
text: both hands, she fires, but misses completely. KURT runs
text: away onto the path. VERONICA throws down her gun with a smile.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Shucks.
text: J.D. races to VERONICA in a white sweat.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Did you miss him completely?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth
dialog: it just to see the look on....
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Don't move! I'll get him back!
text: VERONICA's laughter cuts off like a faucet. Suddenly trembling
text: and confused, she watches J.D. bolt into the woods.
speaker_heading: THE PATH
text: A panicked KURT runs on the path through the woods.
speaker_heading: OFF THE PATH
text: J.D., with a cold efficiency, weaves through trees.
speaker_heading: THE CLEARING
text: VERONICA turns toward Ram's collapsed body.
speaker_heading: THE PATH
text: KURT sees the opening at the end of the woods. J.D. suddenly
text: moves into the light at the end of the woods and raises his gun.
text: KURT runs back the other way with a strangled moan.
speaker_heading: THE CLEARING
text: VERONICA approaches Ram's body with increasing shivers. He
text: does not look bleeding and unconscious. He looks bleeding
text: and dead, dead, dead.
text: KURT barrels into the clearing as J.D. howls from the woods.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Now!
text: In a burst of frightened, animal instinct, VERONICA whips
text: around and fires her gun right into KURT's chest.
text: SQUAD CAR IN SCHOOL PARKING LOT
text: Two cops, MILNER and McCORD, smoke marijuana in a squad car
text: already filled with smoke. After a coughing fit, MILNER shouts.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I heard it that time!
speaker_heading: McCORD
dialog: Wha?
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Another gunshot! From the woods!
speaker_heading: McCORD
dialog: Shit, let's roll.
text: The two officer explode out of the car.
speaker_heading: THE CLEARING
text: J.D. puts his gun in RAM's right hand while VERONICA
text: zombiesquely does the same with KURT and her gun.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
text: Kurt doesn't look too good.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Remember he's left-handed.
text: A quivering VERONICA puts the gun in KURT's left hand.
speaker_heading: MILNER (O.S.)
dialog: Keep going until you hit the clearing!
text: J.D.'s head snaps forward. He yanks up VERONICA. They both run
text: into the woods behind RAM's body as the two Cops charge into
text: the clearing, guns raised. Seeing the Jocks, they stop.
speaker_heading: McCORD
dialog: Mother of Shit!
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Call in!
text: MILNER looks toward where VERONICA and J.D. ran out.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: I heard something out there. I'm
dialog: checking it out.
text: MILNER runs off as McCORD shouts into a walkie-talkie. He is
text: holding the pulse of KURT KELLY.
speaker_heading: McCORD
dialog: This is Officer McCord and I've got
text: two dead bodies in the woods behind
dialog: Westerburg High. Oh my God, one of
text: them's Kurt Kelly, the quarterback.
text: IN THE WOODS
text: VERONICA and J.D. flow through the trees. An Owl hoos.
scene_heading: ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS
text: MILNER blindly barrels through the woods.
text: JUST OUTSIDE THE WOODS
text: VERONICA and J.D. come out of the woods and start running up
text: a grassy hill toward VERONICA's car which is parked on top.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Faster!
text: IN THE WOODS
text: MILNER is jolted by an OWL-HOO, then continues moving.
speaker_heading: THE HILL
text: VERONICA and J.D. reach the car, panting.
text: MILNER races out of the woods just as VERONICA and J.D. slam
text: the car doors closed behind them. MILNER huffs up the hill.
scene_heading: THE SAWYER CAR
text: VERONICA and J.D. somersault into the backseat and begin
text: taking off their clothes.
speaker_heading: THE HILL
text: MILNER continues to move up the hill.
scene_heading: THE SAWYER CAR
text: VERONICA and J.D., stripped down to their underwear, embrace.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE CAR
text: MILNER approaches the car and peers in. His crackling walkie-
text: talkie startles him.
speaker_heading: McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)
dialog: Milner, can you hear me? What's going down?
text: MILNER moves away from the car, then speaks into his walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Think what I heard was just a
dialog: stinking owl. All I got is two kids
text: making out in the backseat of a
dialog: car. Should I pry them apart?
speaker_heading: McCORD (O.S./walkie-talkie)
dialog: Forget it. I got all the answers
dialog: back here, partner.
scene_heading: THE SAWYER CAR
text: Seeing the cop move away. VERONICA and J.D. stop kissing. They

speaker_heading: THE CLEARING
text: MILNER runs back into the clearing.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: What's the deal?
speaker_heading: McCORD
text: Suicide. Double Suicide. They shot
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: That's Kurt Kelly!
speaker_heading: McCORD
dialog: Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Oh my God, suicide? Why?
speaker_heading: McCORD
dialog: Does this answer your question?
text: McCORD reaches in the feminine shopping bag and pulls out the
text: bottles of Perrier water.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Oh man, they were fags!
speaker_heading: McCORD
dialog: Listen up, "We could never reveal our
text: forbidden love to an uncaring and
dialog: ununderstanding world."
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Ah Jesus H. Fuck. Kurt was a Parade
dialog: magazine Honorable Mention...
text: MILNER shakes his head slowly then suddenly looks up.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Wait a second. How did they shoot
dialog: each other if we heard two separate
dialog: sets of gunshots?
speaker_heading: McCORD
dialog: Shit, I always hear gunshots when I'm
dialog: high. Life is one crazy bitch. Don't
text: try to analyze it. The quarterback
dialog: buggering the linebacker. What a waste.
speaker_heading: MILNER
dialog: Oh the humanity.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CONFERENCE ROOM--MORNING

dialog: After every touchdown or whatever,

speaker_heading: PAULINE (O.S.)
dialog: Shut up.
text: The elderly MRS. POPE shakes her head at the suicide note.
speaker_heading: MRS. POPE
dialog: Look at this. "Ununderstanding."
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Will you shut up! We were in a
dialog: similar position Monday and I
dialog: thoughtfully suggested that we get
dialog: the students together for an
text: unadulterated emotional outpouring.
dialog: You took the suggestion as an
dialog: opportunity to play yet another round
dialog: of "Let's laugh at the Hippie."
speaker_heading: COUNSELOR HYDE
dialog: Pauline, if you want a tryout
dialog: for the school play....
text: PRINCIPAL GOWAN hoarsely breaks in.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL GOWAN
dialog: Shut up, Paul. I've seen a lot of
dialog: bullshit--angel dust, switchblades,
dialog: sexually perverse photography
dialog: exhibits involving tennis racquets,
dialog: but this suicide thing....I guess
text: it's all on Pauline's wavelength.
dialog: We're just going to write off today,

scene_heading: EXT. STUDENT PARKING LOT--MORNING
text: VERONICA's car is the lone vehicle in the student parking lot.
scene_heading: THE SAWYER CAR
text: A battered VERONICA climbs into the front seat, pulling on her

text: from the back as other cars begin to fill the lot.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: We killed them, didn't we?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Of course.
text: VERONICA tugs out the car lighter and savagely brands the palm
text: of her hand. J.D. hurdles into the front seat and bats the
text: lighter away. He lights a cigarette off the scorched flesh
text: of VERONICA's hand as she wails away.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot!
text: J.D. drags on his cigarette. School buses are pulling in
text: outside of the parking lot, in front of the school.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You believed it because you wanted
dialog: to believe it. Your true feelings were
dialog: too gross and icky for you to face.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I did not want them dead.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Did to.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Did not.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Did to.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Did not.
text: J.D. launches into a rapid-fire rendition of "did-to's".
text: VERONICA responds by holding her hands over her ears and

text: get louder causing VERONICA to bang on the horn.
speaker_heading: PARKING LOT
text: HEATHER DUKE and a vegged out HEATHER MCNAMARA stop sauntering

scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: (incredulous, but amused)
dialog: No way!
scene_heading: THE SAWYER CAR
text: J.D. pulls VERONICA off the horn and warmly places an unlit
text: cigarette in her mouth. As he speaks, VERONICA wearily takes
text: the cigarette from her mouth and puts it in her blazer pocket.
dialog: J.D.
text: Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt
dialog: and Ram had nothing to offer the school
text: but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (looking to her burnt hand)
dialog: Sure. Can we make an ice run

speaker_heading: MR. KELLY
dialog: If there's any way you can hear me,
dialog: Kurt buddy, I don't care that you

dialog: I love my homosexual son. My son's

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Your son's dead and you love him.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: How do you think Mr. Kelly would

dialog: with a pulse?
text: They quietly laugh. VERONICA sees a LITTLE GIRL staring at her.

scene_heading: INT. SAWYER LIVING ROOM--NIGHT

speaker_heading: VERONICA

speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: The most popular people in the school
dialog: are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a
dialog: good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather
dialog: depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I
dialog: gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing
dialog: but what really frightens me is that
dialog: I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do
dialog: next. It's God versus my boyfriend

dialog: I'm just so thrilled to announce that
text: Whitney James of WETC News is taping a
dialog: rap session with students from area
dialog: high schools including Westerburg.
text: Cheers raucously emerge from the enlivened students.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Let's show the world Westerburg is a
dialog: diverse happy home, not Suicide Central!
dialog: (shrewdly)
dialog: You know there's some people who say
text: Westerburg is too weak and wimpy a
dialog: school to be on T.V. Is that true?
text: The STUDENTS make loud, scattered rumblings of the word "No."
text: PAULINE hungrily unbuttons her paisley blazer.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No or Hell No?
speaker_heading: STUDENTS
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Hell no!
text: Frightened and flustered by the fanatic camaraderie around her,
text: MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK quakes for a moment then crawls
text: underneath her table.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I can't hear you....
text: Fingering her bangs in an attempt at composure, VERONICA steps
text: into the cafeteria and her fellow students boom.
speaker_heading: STUDENTS
dialog: HELL NO!
text: As a blown away VERONICA takes in the panorama of students
text: from different cliques chanting to the beat of PAULINE's
text: gospel recital, PAULINE's voice is replaced on the
text: soundtrack by the evocative female moanings of the opening scene.
text: J.D., also wearing a black armband, stalks VERONICA from
text: behind. His hand unzips her dress.
text: The female voices swell louder as a glowing VERONICA takes in
text: glorious images. Geek BRACES and a JOCK chant together, standing
text: on chairs. HEATHER MCNAMARA and HEAVY METALER MATT look to each
text: other dubiously then mindlessly shout out. A MORRISONESQUE
text: STONER dances on a table of cheering BETTY-FINN-A-LIKES.
text: J.D. slides his hand through the opening in Veronica's dress.
text: The female voices cut off as the spell over VERONICA breaks.
text: She swings her elbow into J.D.'s stomach.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Can't you see this is a special moment?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I was just making it more special.
speaker_heading: PAULINE (O.S.)
dialog: Veronica, there you are!
text: VERONICA spins to an electric PAULINE FLEMING glistening in the
text: mouth of the cafeteria, flanked by HEATHER DUKE and PETER DAWSON.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: You people are in charge of getting
dialog: delegates from every clique in the
dialog: school to be on the Whitney James
dialog: Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special.
dialog: Let's be able to say we were the ones
dialog: who put peer pressure out to pasture.
text: J.D. looks out through the cafeteria. He sees Martha poke her
text: head out from beneath her lunch table then dart back under.
text: J.D. moves away from the chattering group.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Westerburg? A happy family?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: I'm sure you'll work something out.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: (wickedly)
dialog: Don't worry. We'll work something out.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Yes. Yes. We'll work something out.
dialog: I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
scene_heading: MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK'S TABLE
text: MARTHA slithers from under the table up into her seat, and head
text: down, trys to finish off a bowl of soup. She slowly looks up and
text: freezes. J.D. is revealed to be seated across from her, behind his
text: Rebel Without a Cause lunch box. He smiles warmly.
dialog: J.D.
text: Greetings and salutations.
scene_heading: INT. J.D.'S LIVING ROOM--NIGHT
text: VERONICA beams and babbles over the room while on the couch,
text: J.D. restlessly works his channel changer.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms.
dialog: Fleming wants to redefine the high
dialog: school experience.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: She wants to ignore the high school
dialog: experience. Our way's better. We
dialog: scare people into not being assholes.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Don't even talk about that stuff!
text: J.D. comically cups his hands together to holler.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You mean the time you blew Kurt
dialog: Kelly's ass away!
text: VERONICA throws the first thing she can get her hands on, a
text: framed picture of a woman, at the roaring J.D.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You can be so immature!
dialog: J.D.
dialog: (looking off)
dialog: You kids are making too much damn noise.
text: FRED DEAN is revealed to be standing in the front doorway,

speaker_heading: FRED DEAN
dialog: We beat the bitches.
speaker_heading: VERONICA

dialog: Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home.
speaker_heading: FRED DEAN
dialog: Judge told em to slurp shit and die.
text: FRED DEAN crams the cassette in his V.C.R. and hefts up a chest
text: exerciser. He begins pumping away as the image of a shabby
text: building appears on the massive T.V.
speaker_heading: FRED DEAN
dialog: I put a Norwegian in the boiler room.
text: Masterful. When that blew, it set off
text: a pack of thermals I'd stuck upstairs.
text: The building blows up. FRED DEAN cackles. J.D. politely
text: applauds. FRED pops out the videocassette and bounces away.
speaker_heading: FRED DEAN
dialog: It's great to be alive!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Do you like your father?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Never given the matter much thought.
dialog: Liked my mother.
text: J.D. picks up the framed picture that Veronica threw.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: They said her death was an accident.
dialog: But she knew when the explosives were
text: set to go off. She knew...
text: VERONICA slowly sits down next to J.D. with dazed concern.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming
dialog: has given us a chance to atone for...
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Our sins? What sins? If you put a
text: Nazi in a concentration camp, does
dialog: that make you a Nazi?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Maybe.
text: J.D. exhales in frustration and changes some more channels.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Whoa! Amazing!
scene_heading: THE T.V. SCREEN
text: A music video flashes on the Dead T.V. screen. THREE GORGEOUS
text: WOMEN, stylishly furnished, evocatively wail the female moans
text: heard throughout the film. The video viewpoint then pans to
text: two overly gorgeous young men wearing trendy hair and trendy
text: clothes. They sing/shout before an all-white background. A

speaker_heading: BIGFUN (T.V.)
text: TIMES ARE MEAN FOR A TEEN--WE KNOW!
scene_heading: PARENTS IGNORE, TEACHERS BORE--WE KNOW!
dialog: J.D.

scene_heading: VIDEO: INT. A GIRL'S BEDROOM--DAY
text: Now in full screen, the video viewpoint cuts to a very depressed
text: and very cute, white, female VID VICTIM ONE sitting at her
text: dressing table. She pours a bottle of pills into her hand.
speaker_heading: BIGFUN (V.O.)
text: BUT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO GO!
text: BIGFUN magically materialize next to VID VICTIM ONE. The pills

speaker_heading: BIGFUN
text: TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
text: TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
text: J.D. pulls out a gun with an ethereal expression on his face.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: We've made MTV.
text: J.D. fires into the radiant image of BIGFUN, destroying the
text: T.V. and disgusting VERONICA, who bolts off the couch. He
text: raucously crawls after her.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: We're breaking up. I am out!
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Wha-at? Come on, there's another
dialog: T.V. in the kitchen. You know
dialog: you used to have a sense of humor.
text: J.D. playfully tackles VERONICA. This calms rather than angers.
text: She turns on her back. J.D. follows suit.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're getting too cool for me, J.D.
dialog: I don't know how to talk to you.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Our relationship's moving fast, I know,
dialog: but I have real, real respect for you.
text: VERONICA sighs, then rolls over into a crawling position and
text: eventually into a walking-out-the-door position.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline
dialog: thing work. Lines of communication
dialog: between the cliques. You were a phase....
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Phase my ass! You'll be back! I'm
dialog: storming Normandy beaches and you're
text: running in place with Pauline Fonda's
text: airhead peacenik exercise program.
dialog: Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
text: J.D. bounds up to a kitchen counter and flicks on a small T.V.
text: BIGFUN can be heard booming their song. J.D. broods.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM--DAY
text: J.D. moves to an empty row of desks. He turns the first desk as
text: to face the second. HEATHER DUKE warily lowers herself into the
text: second desk as J.D. flops a manilla envelope onto it. HEATHER
text: DUKE opens the envelope and pulls out a stack of 8 by 10's.
text: She gasps.
text: The first shot shows a YOUNG HEATHER DUKE in a summer camp
text: uniform that vibrantly reads HEATHER, She is holding one end
text: of a large poster board drawing of two Eskimos rubbing noses.
text: Holding the other end, in a summer camp uniform vibrantly
text: reading MARTHA, is a YOUNG MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: What the.....
text: With a harsh laugh, she takes in the next photograph. It has

text: marshmallows off each other's sticks.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: (trying to stay clam)
dialog: Where did you get these?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Oh, I just had the nicest chat with
dialog: Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's
dialog: scary how everyone's got a story to
dialog: tell....Would you care to see the
dialog: canoeing shots?
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: What do you want from me?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy
dialog: togetherness, it needs a leader.
dialog: Heather Chandler was that leader but...
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: But she couldn't handle it.
text: J.D. laughs. She's on the ball.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye
dialog: Holden says his ideal job'd be making
dialog: sure some kids don't fall off a cliff.
dialog: He doesn't realize if you pay too much
dialog: attention to the kids, you'll back off
dialog: the cliff yourself.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Very very. The photographs?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a
dialog: favor. You'll get the negatives and
dialog: everything back then.
text: J.D. launches away from his desk with a grin. He places a
text: red ribbon on HEATHER DUKE's desk.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: In the meantime, strength, And hey,
dialog: there's a little gift.
scene_heading: INT. THE GIRLS BATHROOM
text: A spooked HEATHER DUKE splashes water on her face and looks up
text: into the mirror. In a trance, she pulls her hair back Heather
text: Chandler fashion and ties it with the ribbon J.D. gave her.
text: A BETTY FINN-A-LIKE moves up to the sink beside her. Two CHIC
text: BABES enter the bathroom with pouting expressions. Seemingly
text: in a trance, HEATHER DUKE bends over and wipes off her wet
text: hands using the oblivious BETTY FINN-A-LIKE's dress. HEATHER
text: DUKE winks to the now-giggling CHIC BABES and saunters off.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: HEATHER DUKE bursts through the bathroom door to wickedly
text: strut down the hall. She scowls/smiles in perfect Heather
text: Chandler fashion to various passers-by.
scene_heading: EARL FRAZIER'S LOCKER
text: VERONICA genially lobbys the big black EARL FRAZIER.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Let me get it clear, Veronica. You
dialog: want yourself a sweet homeboy for
dialog: this T.V. show so you can show
dialog: everybody what a loose, Martin Luther
dialog: Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: Something like that. Will you do it?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I just want to show different kinds
dialog: of people can get together and it
dialog: doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't
dialog: get treated badly here do you?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: I don't get treated at all, but hey,
dialog: don't worry about it. I'll do your
dialog: thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
text: VERONICA hands him a Guest Pass tag.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Things are going to change, Earl.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: HEATHER DUKE impishly blinds VERONICA with her hands.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Guess who?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Heather.
text: HEATHER DUKE lets go with a small giggle. VERONICA turns to
text: face her Heather Chandler-looking friend and her smile dies.
text: VERONICA violently pushes HEATHER DUKE away and storms off.
scene_heading: INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT
text: Lying on the floor, VERONICA concentrates on her phone. With
text: a deep sigh, she pushbuttons out a number. She pauses, then...
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Ouch. Your machine's got the most
dialog: obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry.
scene_heading: INT. HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM
text: VERONICA's voice drones through HEATHER DUKE's answering machine.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (O.S./machine)
dialog: I'm just calling to say you can
dialog: wear your hair any way you want to.
text: A Male hand picks up the phone. It's College boy DAVID.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on
dialog: anybody's carpet lately?
speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM
text: VERONICA cringes.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Is this David? Heather's David?
dialog: What are you doing....
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What can I say? I was pretty broken
dialog: up by Heather C.'s suicide. I needed
dialog: somebody super-sensitive like Heather D.
speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm delirious for the both of you.
dialog: Can you put Heather on?
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM
text: DAVID proudly looks down off-screen to his lap.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: She can't really talk right now.
speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM
text: VERONICA slams down the receiver and pulls up a sleek leather
text: address book. She severely scans through it. Tossing it away,
text: VERONICA then descends into the sundry junk of her night
text: table drawer and draws up another address book; this one is
text: frayed and pink polka-dotted. She peruses it and dials.....
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hello, Betty.....
scene_heading: EXT. SAWYER BACKYARD--DAY
text: BETTY FINN hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in
text: delight. VERONICA has a motherly smile on her face.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't believe it. I'm winning.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Don't get cocky, girl.
text: BETTY bends down to shoot then raises her body back up.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I missed you. I know I'm not as, as
dialog: exciting as your other friends.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: That's bullshit. Just shoot.
text: BETTY once again bends and raises.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (warmly)
dialog: Shoot.
text: BETTY finally shoots. Feebly.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Betty, your daydreams are a lot
dialog: better than my realities, believe
dialog: me. I'm afraid though it's time to
dialog: get your butt kicked.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Ronnie!
text: VEONCIA gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. And instead
text: hits BETTY's ball. Disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she
text: determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from BETTY's.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Hey, you're not settling for the two
dialog: shots are you? Knock me out girl.
dialog: It's the only way.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: It's not my style, okay?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Nice guys finish last. I should know.
text: VERONICA sighs then knocks BETTY's adjacent ball sailing
text: toward the porch and a statuesque HEATHER DUKE who does
text: not budge as the ball whizzes past her.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Brav-o!
speaker_heading: BETTY FINN
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: I've got to get going, Veronica.
dialog: See you at the studio.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Sure. See ya.
text: HEATHER DUKE walks toward the girls followed by a meandering
text: desultory HEATHER MCNAMARA, who picks up a green mallet and
text: fragilely swings it; her early robustness a forgotten memory.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Croquet won't be the same without Heather.
text: HEATHER DUKE hustles back toward a passing BETTY FINN.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Oh Betty, wait. I almost forgot...The
dialog: Whitney James Teenage Suicide
dialog: Prevention T.V. Special isn't going
dialog: to be taped at the studios. It's
dialog: going to be done in the Park.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: But I thought...
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: (heading back)
dialog: It's going to be like a big picnic.
dialog: Bring some potato salad...HEY, I'M RED!
scene_heading: LATER IN THE GAME
text: HEATHER DUKE's red ball slams into HEATHER MCNAMARA's green one.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: So did you call people to tell them
dialog: how to get to the studio tonight?
text: HEATHER DUKE savagely "sends" HEATHER MACNAMARA's ball into
dialog: the flower bed.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Back off. I called everyone, even that
dialog: Stoner slut. Felt like giving my phone
dialog: a bath. I told Betty just now...Damn!
text: HEATHER DUKE's shot swerves wide of the wicket.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're so polluted. Talking down to
dialog: people, making fake notes....
text: VERONICA blows her shot.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: I don't see what gives you the right
dialog: to lecture, Ronnie. You were
dialog: soulmates with Betty Finn until you
dialog: realized you're the cover of
dialog: Seventeen magazine and she's the
text: before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad.
text: HEATHER DUKE bashes her ball into VERONICA's and prepares
dialog: to send it.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Some people just don't matter. Why
dialog: should those who do carry their
dialog: weight? Am I right?
text: As HEATHER DUKE swings down her mallet, VERONICA steps on her
text: own ball. When HEATHER DUKE's mallet makes contact, the two
text: balls slam against each other, unmoving, with a loud smack.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No, you're wrong. It's not even
dialog: your turn.
text: The depressed and disoriented HEATHER MCNAMARA, laying
text: against a tree, pipes in.
speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: She's right.....Boy, croquet's not
dialog: the same without Heather.
scene_heading: INT. WETC T.V. STATION--DUSK
text: In a sleek WETC station hallway, VERONICA SAWYER, a Guest Pass
text: affixed to her heart, holds her hand in a spurting drinking

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Ich Luge bullets. I'm such a jerk.
text: PETER DAWSON beams toward her, wearing a Guest Pass.
speaker_heading: PETER DAWSON
dialog: Veronica, I thought we lost you.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I was waiting for my friend Betty.
text: VERONICA looks at her watch then joins PETER's march down the hall.
speaker_heading: PETER DAWSON
dialog: Teens talking it out on T.V.! Would it be
dialog: pretentious of me to attach a videocassette
dialog: of the show on my Princeton application?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Shucks, that's a great idea, Pete.
text: They burst through the studio double doors.
speaker_heading: STUDIO
text: VERONICA and PETER take in a panorama of attractive, clean-cut
text: STUDENTS from various schools chatting near Wine and Cheese
text: tables set up to the side of an impressive, elevated,
text: circular stage. All STUDENTS are wearing pink armbands.
speaker_heading: PETER DAWSON
dialog: This is excellent, but I thought we
dialog: were going to get equal representation
dialog: on this thind: Geeks, Gearheads...
text: Out of nowhere, a bubbling HEATHER DUKE knots a pink armband
text: around PETER's arm with a giggle.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: They're probably just being
text: fashionably late.
text: PETER DAWSON prances off with a raucous laugh. VERONICA stares
text: dumbfounded at the wicked homogeneity of the STUDENTS as HEATHER
text: DUKE ties a pink armband on her.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Is this very or what? Oh, you've
dialog: gotta meet Whitney James! Come on!
text: HEATHER DUKE tugs VERONICA across the crowded studio floor to
text: where the WETC news set is situated. Smoking casually in her
text: anchor's chair is the beautiful WHITNEY JAMES.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Whitney, here's my friend.....
speaker_heading: WHITNEY JAMES
dialog: Ah please sit down.
text: HEATHER DUKE glides away. VERONICA uncomfortably steps onto
text: the news set and moves down next to WHITNEY JAMES.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY JAMES
dialog: I got a confession to make. My name
dialog: used to be Heather, too.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: But my name's not...
speaker_heading: WHITNEY JAMES
dialog: People just don't take the name Heather
dialog: seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
scene_heading: WINE AND CHEESE TABLE
text: HEATHER MCNAMARA surreptitiously picks up a bottle of wine and
text: with a sad expression, proceeds to down it.
speaker_heading: THE NEWS SET
text: VERONICA apologizes to a blissfully oblivious WHITNEY JAMES.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there
dialog: were going to be different kinds of social
dialog: and psychological types at this gathering.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY JAMES
dialog: Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather.
dialog: The minute you try to deal with the actual
dialog: teenagers who have contemplated suicide
dialog: you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand
dialog: filled with bad complexions, bad grades,
dialog: bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of
dialog: doody nobody wants to hear let alone
text: bend down to clean up.
text: WHITNEY JAMES tears open a bag of Corn Nuts and showers some
text: into her mouth. She speaks as she sucks and chews.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY JAMES
dialog: I'm not knocking teen suicide. It's
dialog: exciting stuff. My personal faves
dialog: are those kids from loaded families
text: grabbing the mike to whine how even
dialog: though they bagged a B.M.W. on their
dialog: birthday, they're still quote-unquote
dialog: depressed. It's ridiculous. People who
dialog: say money can't buy happiness don't
dialog: know where to shop.
text: WHITNEY JAMES titters. VERONICA is a statue of mortification.
scene_heading: EXT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK--TWILIGHT
text: In the neighborhood park, gloomy members of various cliques sit
text: in silence at picnic tables. All are ludicrously wearing
text: Guest Passes. BETTY FINN mumbles down to her potato salad.
text: EARL FRAZIER stoically stares off into space. Heavy Metaler
text: CLYDE holds an absurdly large picnic basket.
speaker_heading: CLYDE
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: NEWS SET
text: Completely flabbergasted, VERONICA manages a light tone.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: The world wants winners, I guess.
text: Not people stained with loserness.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY JAMES
dialog: Stained with loserness. Oh, I like
dialog: it. Can I use that. It'd be
text: dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll
dialog: excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
speaker_heading: WHITNEY JAMES
dialog: Sure. Ciao.
speaker_heading: STUDIO FLOOR
text: Sickened, VERONICA stumbles onto the studio floor. Studio
text: lights suddenly pop on, momentarily blinding her. PAULINE
text: grabs VERONICA by the arm and shouts into the air.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
text: Everyone take their places on the stage!
dialog: (to Veronica)
dialog: Isn't this thrilling?!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: What, the wine? I realize you're all
dialog: under 21, but it seemed like such a
dialog: perfect touch.
dialog: (shouting upward)
dialog: Could we get some more light up here?
speaker_heading: THE STAGE
text: The pink armbanded Aryan youths form a circle on the circular stage.
text: Pauline moves to a microphone at the center stage beside a
text: seated WHITNEY JAMES who's tuning her electric guitar.
text: VERONICA helplessly stands between the circle of STUDENTS and
text: the two female hosts as the cameras go on. PAULINE sings/speaks
text: into the microphone while WHITNEY JAMES strums her guitar.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Our schools have been torn apart by
dialog: tragedy. Let's fuse them back together
dialog: through love. Let's clasp hands and
dialog: connect ourselves in one mighty circuit
text: like a dove.
text: The students sthereally reach out to each other and clasp
text: hands. VERONICA quivers for a moment then bursts through
text: a handholding HEATHER DUKE and HEATHER MCNAMARA and off the stage.
speaker_heading: PAULINE (O.S.)
dialog: Let's begin a new happiness...
text: VERONICA swaggers past a seated TECHNICIAN. He pushes up a
text: console lever causing the outer edge of the stage, where the
text: circle of hand-holding students is, to slowly spin around
text: the singing PAULINE and the strumming WHITNEY JAMES.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: ...with no more suicide...
speaker_heading: STUDENTS
dialog: (eeriely)
dialog: Oh yeah...
text: Ripping off her pink armband, VERONICA freezes. Standing at
text: the wine and cheese table, gunslinger coat and all, is J.D.
text: He turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Holy traumatic experiences, Batman.
dialog: I'm sorry you felt you had to put
dialog: yourself through all that shit. I
dialog: told you it wouldn't...Hey, it's in
dialog: the past already, right?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: No more problems....
text: Devastated, VERONICA sways back toward the TECHNICIAN's console.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: VERONICA slams the lever back down forcing the spinning circle
text: of handholding, pink-armbanded STUDENTS to crash to the ground
text: around a taken-aback PAULINE and WHITNEY JAMES.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Cute.
text: WHITNEY JAMES playfully lets off a Hendrixian riff before
text: coolly leaning over to her microphone.

scene_heading: OUTSIDE STUDIO DOORS
text: VERONICA bursts through the studio doors, panting rapidly. She

text: station hallway, weaving through various REPORTER-types.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE T.V. STATION--TWILIGHT
text: VERONICA pops out the studio door, running faster.
scene_heading: GRAVELLY ROAD
text: She sprints down the side of a road. Her bare feet pound
text: against sharp pebbles.
scene_heading: THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARK
text: VERONICA now barrels through the neighborhood park. She looks
text: to her outcast classmates. In tableau, they stare back. BETTY
text: FINN on a park carousel spins in and out of view.
speaker_heading: PROMENADE
text: VERONICA speeds past the shops and the movie theatre. The viewer
text: remains at the theatre ticket booth as MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK
text: wearing a BIGFUN T-shirt, pushes three dollars through the
text: ticket window to a bored female cashier.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
text: Bargain matinees are for the first

scene_heading: INT. SAWYER FAMILY/T.V. ROOM--NIGHT
text: VERONICA huffs and puffs into her family room where her MOM and
dialog: DAD are watching T.V.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage
dialog: Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Color me educated. I learned high
dialog: school happiness is for members only,
dialog: Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality
dialog: if it lived in her uterus, and reality's
dialog: name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a
dialog: major creep.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about, honey, but can it wait a bit.
dialog: We're watching this special program
dialog: on Teen Problems.
text: VERONICA half-bitterly laughs at the irony.
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATRE
text: The light of the screen flickers on an overwhelmingly sullen
text: MARTHA. She moves her leg and knocks a large Coke across the
text: floor. She tragically stares at the Cola pool.
scene_heading: SAWYER FAMILY/T.V. ROOM
text: A DAN RATHER VOICE booms from the T.V. The SAWYERS stare.
speaker_heading: DAN RATHER VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Oh sure, I'll bet even back when I
dialog: went to school there were drugs, even
dialog: sex, but they were simpler times. The
dialog: Sherwood suicides tell the bitter

text: VERONICA snaps off the T.V.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Turn that back on!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: This condescending junk makes suicide

dialog: feel like shit! Get the respect in
dialog: death you'll never get in life.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: If we're not going to watch that

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Are you trying to tell me it is not

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Everybody cares for youth but nobody

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I'm lost. You don't get enough
dialog: attention, you get too much attention.
dialog: Which is it? Where are your shoes?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: All we want is to be treated like
dialog: human beings, not like guinea pigs
dialog: to be experimented on and not like
text: bunny rabbits to be patronized.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I don't patronize bunny rabbits.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Treated like human beings? Is that
dialog: what you said little Miss Voice of
dialog: a Generation? Just how do you think
dialog: adults act with other adults? You
dialog: think it's all just Doubles Tennis.
dialog: Adults can be horrible to other adults.
dialog: When teenagers complain that they
dialog: want to be treated like human beings,
dialog: it's usually because they are being
dialog: treated like human beings.
text: VERONICA leans against the wall with a melancholy smile.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I guess I picked the wrong time to
dialog: be a human being.
text: MOM is embarassed for getting so involved. She meekly

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You'll live. Want some pate?
text: HEATHER DUKE suddenly breezes in the room.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica,

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (repulsed)
dialog: Is she dead?
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
text: That's the punchline. She's still
text: alive, in stable condition. Another

text: VERONICA slaps HEATHER DUKE in the face.
scene_heading: INT. VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

speaker_heading: VERONICA

scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE

scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE

scene_heading: TROUBLED MALE VOICE (Radio)
dialog: I know it's supposed to be funny

speaker_heading: VERONICA (V.O.)
dialog: Yes, Dear Diary, I've cut off Heather

scene_heading: GIRLS BATHROOM

scene_heading: GIRLS BATHROOM

speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA

speaker_heading: HEATHER MCNAMARA
dialog: Suicide is a private thing.

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You're giving your life away to

dialog: Hey, just sign the petition!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Don't talk to me like that.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE

speaker_heading: VERONICA

scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (jokingly but caustically)
dialog: I was thinking more along the lines

text: open and making it look like a suicide.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I could be up for that. I've already

text: in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye,
dialog: if you know what I mean. So are we on?
text: VERONICA somberly steps forward to J.D., grabs his elbows, then

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You have been depressed lately. Oh,

speaker_heading: VERONICA

speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)

speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOUSE--NIGHT
text: J.D. laconically leans against his motorcycle with his legs

speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM

dialog: J.D.
dialog: Nice. It's got that Catcher-in-the-Ryey-
dialog: I-hate-the-world-and-the-world-hates-me-

speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Get off my bed, you sick psycho!
dialog: You think you're a rebel! You're

dialog: "You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's
dialog: call the whole thing off...Hold it!
text: VERONICA freezes and J.D. reaches up to her hand where she
text: holds the Catcher in the Rye. Her index finger is curled into
text: the book. Sitting up, J.D. carefully opens the book at that
text: place and peers in.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I

scene_heading: INT. THE DUKE KITCHEN--NIGHT

dialog: This knife is filthy.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: What in the hell do you think I'm
dialog: doing? Taking out her tonsils?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: I think I know Heather a bit better
dialog: than you, okay? If she was going to
dialog: slash her wrists, the knife would
dialog: be absolutely spotless.
text: J.D. grabs a dishtowel and vigorously wipes off the knife.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: How's this? Can you see your
dialog: fucking reflection?
text: She can and so can the viewer. Tears well in VERONICA's eyes.
text: She begins to shudder, a shattered smile quaking on her face.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Tomorrow someone else will move
dialog: into her place. That person
dialog: could be me.
text: (suddenly deliriously defiant)
dialog: Ha, there's only one of us who knows
dialog: Heather's handwriting and if you think
dialog: I'm doing another suicide note.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You don't get it, do you? Society
text: nods its head at any horror the
dialog: American teenager can think to
dialog: bring upon itself. We don't need
dialog: gloves and does anyone really
dialog: care about exact handwriting?
text: J.D. tears his gloves off with a giggle. He takes a pen from
text: the kitchen counter and paper from a cutesy memo pad. He
text: shoves the pen in VERONICA's hand and grabbing her hand,
text: forces her to scribble LIFE SUCKS on the paper.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Perfecto. Man, I've even got a
text: marked-up Catcher in the Rye.
dialog: What else does a suicide need?

dialog: J.D.
dialog: (raising the knife)
dialog: If you'll excuse me......
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: No-o!
text: J.D. hops in the adjoinging room and slams the door. VERONICA
text: races to the door wailing. She maniacally rattles the doorknob
text: trying to open the locked door.
scene_heading: INT. AN ANOYNYMOUS T.V.
text: The sound of the rattling doorknob subtly turns into wild
text: African music thundering on the soundtrack as WHITNEY JAMES,

scene_heading: INT. NEWSPAPER/YEARBOOK WORKSHOP--DAY

scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME--DAY

speaker_heading: FATHER RIPPER
dialog: Eskimo.
text: FATHER RIPPER lets the word hang in the air, then holds up
text: the copy of The Catcher in the Rye.
speaker_heading: FATHER RIPPER
dialog: Heather Duke underlined a lot of
dialog: things in this copy of The Catcher
dialog: in the Rye, but I believe the word
dialog: Eskimo, underlined all by itself is
text: the key to understanding Heather's pain.
text: VERONICA stands in a corner with an "Oh brother" look on her face.
speaker_heading: FATHER RIPPER
text: On the surface, Heather Duke was the
dialog: vivacious young lady we all knew her
dialog: to be. But her soul was in Antartica,
dialog: freezing with the knowledge of the way
dialog: fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way
dialog: parents can be unresponsive, and as she
text: writes so eloquently in her suicide note,
dialog: the way life can suck. We'll all miss
dialog: Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope
text: she's rubbing noses with Jesus.
text: HEATHER CHANDLER moves next to VERONICA holding a plate

dialog: Is this turnout weak or what? I had

text: in, VERONICA's tightly closed eyes snap open in a sweat as her
text: mother's voice continues to filter through the door. It's all
dialog: been a dream...........
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: Dinner! Veronica! Dinner!
text: VERONICA closes her eyes and holds her heart. She suddenly
text: launches to her desk, opens her diary, shoves on her
text: monocle, catches her breath, and begins writing.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (O.S.)
dialog: Dear Diary, no one can stop J.D. Not
text: the F.B.I., the C.I.A., or the P.T.A.
dialog: That is to say, no one but me. I know
text: where J.D. is coming from and where
dialog: he is heading. He's wrong, but I'm going
dialog: to teach him what's right. I'm going
dialog: to stop J.D....If it's the last thing
dialog: I do.
text: VERONICA leans back in her chair, sweating. She reaches in the
text: pocket of a blazer draped over the back of the chair and pulls
text: out the cigarette J.D. had given her eariler in the film. She
text: puts it in her mouth unlit then takes it out and puts it back
text: in the blazer.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE SAWYER HOME--NIGHT
text: J.D. remains laconically leaning against his motorcycle with
text: his legs suavely crossed as he was before Veronica began
text: dreaming. J.D. finishes his cigarette and pulls out a gun. He
text: checks the bullets, puts the gun back in his coat, and heads
text: toward the house.
speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM
text: VERONICA hugs J.F.K. the cat then rips down the hanging Barbie.

speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM

text: rafter, neck in a noose of bedshoots, is VERONICA.
scene_heading: INT. THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE
text: MOM sets a glass of milk at VERONICA's place, distressed.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Honey?
speaker_heading: VERONICA'S BEDROOM
text: J.D. paces the room, sweating and ranting, waving a gun in
text: one hand, the Barbie doll in the other.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I can't believe you did it. I was
dialog: teasing. I loved you. Sure, I climbed
dialog: up here to kill you, but first I was
dialog: going to try and get you back. With
dialog: amazing petition.
text: J.D. throws the gun on the bed and pulls from his coat the
text: computer printout sheet petition, then savagely rolls it out
text: on the floor. It is filled with signatures of different
text: sizes, styles, and colors. J.F.K. blinks.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: It's a shame you can't see what our
dialog: fellow students really signed.
text: J.D. flicks open a switchblade. He runs the blade beneath
text: the typed paragraph at the top causing it to peel off,
text: reavealing another typed paragraph.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Listen. "We students of Westerburg
dialog: High will die. Today. Our burning
dialog: bodies will be the ultimate protest
dialog: to a society that degrades is. Fuck
dialog: you all." Not that subtle but neither's
dialog: blowing up the school. Talk about your
dialog: suicide pacts. When our school explodes
dialog: tomorrow, it's going to be the kind of
dialog: thing that infects a generation. A
dialog: Woodstock for the 80's. Damn, we
dialog: coulda toasted marshmallows together.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: Honey, are you all right in there?
text: J.D. swiftly picks up the petition and heads out the window.
text: MOM enters the room and, seeing her hanging daughter,
text: launches into frantic screams.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my
dialog: baby back! I should have let you keep
dialog: that job at the mall. I was just afraid
dialog: of you coming home alone at night!
text: VERONICA opens her eyes.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I made your favorite! Spaghetti!
dialog: Lots of oregano!
text: VERONICA undos the noose around her neck but still remains
text: hanging for the rope runs all the way down her back beneath
text: her blazer and is tied around her waist. She undos the waist-
text: knot and lands on her bed. She quickly puts a small pillow
text: over the left-behind gun, unnoticed by her dazed MOM.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hey Mom, why so tense?
scene_heading: THE SAWYER DINNER TABLE
text: Montage music plays as VERONICA rears up from her dinner
text: plate to see her stonefaced PARENTS and her CAT staring at her.
scene_heading: INT. J.D.'S BEDROOM--NIGHT
text: J.D. tools with a bomb at his desk. A KNOCK on the door. J.D.
text: turns down his stereo (and the Montage music).
speaker_heading: FRED DEAN (O.S.)
dialog: I need some help with my homework...
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Sorry tiger, I'm a little busy....
text: J.D. turns back up his stereo (and the Montage music).
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF WESTERBERG HIGH--MORNING
text: The Montage music continues as school buses arrive in front

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT--MORNING
text: STUDENTS come out of their cars.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY--MORNING
text: Typically hectic start-of-another-day-opening-and-slamming-of-
text: locker-action. VERONICA darts through the thoroughfare to her locker.
text: A passing PAULINE FLEMING screeches to a halt, grabbing VERONICA
text: as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee.
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: Veronica! J.D. told me you
dialog: committed suicide last night!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Where is he? Where's J.D.?
speaker_heading: PAULINE
dialog: We have to talk. Whether to kill
dialog: yourself is one of the most important
dialog: decisions a teenager has to make.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Get a job.
text: VERONICA storms away to her nearby locker. She swirls her locker
text: combination and opens it. She glances down the hall and freezes.
text: In the distance, J.D. moves mechanically down the hallway
text: carrying a large gym bag, wearing a Walkman.
text: VERONICA climbs into her locker. She closes it until it is
text: barely perceptibly ajar. J.D. strides past the locker and into
dialog: the Boys bathroom.
scene_heading: BOYS BATHROOM
text: J.D smoothly moves into a stall and closes the door. He
text: turns off his Walkman and ends the Montage music.
speaker_heading: THE HALLWAY
text: The hallway slowly clears as STUDENTS go to class. The bell
text: rings. A LATE STUDENT races through the empty hallway.
text: VERONICA carefully hatches out of her locker. She treads down
text: the hallway as if something were about to jump out at her.
speaker_heading: THE GYM
text: A group of cheerleaders including HEATHER MCNAMARA are lazily
text: doing cartwheels on the gym floor. On a small stage set up
text: beside them, other STUDENTS are putting up folding chairs.
text: PRINCIPAL GOWAN says "Testing" into a microphone.
text: J.D., toting the gym bag, quietly opens the gym door and slips
text: inside. He swiftly moves unnoticed to a position underneath
text: the bleachers.
speaker_heading: THE HALLWAY
text: VERONICA peers around a corner to see an empty hallway.
scene_heading: UNDER THE BLEACHERS
text: Using heavy black masking tape, J.D. tapes a thermal bomb to a
text: steel support beneath the bleachers. Other thermal bombs can
text: be discerned taped to other supports.
scene_heading: THE EMPTY HALLWAY
text: VERONICA cautiously treads down the empty hallway, trying to
text: keep in control. Suddenly, packs of STUDENTS burst from
text: classroom doors behind VERONICA. The excited swarms of
text: STUDENTS move toward and past VERONICA, who has braked her
text: troubled treading to stiffly contemplate her passing peers.
text: She latches onto Geek RODNEY in a panic. RODNEY looks down at
text: his clutched arm with a nervous smile.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Rodney, where's everybody going?
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: It's Friday.....
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Oh my God, the damn pep assembly....
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: Yeah, these things are pretty artificial,
dialog: but at least we all get out of class...
text: VERONICA ignores RODNEY's amiable attemots at conversation to
text: inquisitively move forward through the crowd.
speaker_heading: THE GYM
text: J.D. darts from out underneath the bleachers to the gym doors.
text: He pops the doors open and sees the crowd of STUDENTS move
text: toward the gym. He suavely pauses then dashes down a nearby
text: set of stairs.
text: THE HALLWAY LEADING TO THE GYM
text: VERONICA continues to tensely surf the tidal wave of STUDENTS
text: heading for the gymnasium. She stops to watch her classmates
text: file into the gym like lemmings with increasing sense of
text: dread. She again latches onto a passing RODNEY.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Rodney, what's underneath the gym?
text: RODNEY (unconsciously) dramatically stops, turns to VERONICA.
dialog: and says........
speaker_heading: RODNEY
text: The boiler room.
text: VERONICA blanches then lunges through the crowd. She topples a
text: couple disgruntled STUDENTS before careening down the
text: staircase beside the gym.
scene_heading: HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BOILER ROOM
text: J.D. walks by the firm glass windows of the boiler room,
text: eyeing the pounding generators inside. He stops at a heavy
text: steel door. Placing down his gym bag, J.D. proceeds to swiftly
text: pick the lock. He swings open the steel door.
speaker_heading: VERONICA (O.S.)
dialog: May I see your hall pass?
text: J.D. weilds around. A sweating VERONICA moves toward him,
text: pointing the bedroom gun at him.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I knew that loose was too noose! I
dialog: mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Like father, like son. A serious-as-
dialog: fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll
text: set off a pack of thermals upstairs.
dialog: Okay, so let's start by slowly putting
text: the bomb down on the ground.
text: J.D. looks down at the gym bag already on the ground. He
text: folds his arms and smiles. VERONICA forcefully moves closer.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that.
dialog: Put your hands on your head.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You didn't say Simon Says.
text: J.D. suddenly kicks out into VERONICA's stomach, doubling her
text: over and causing her to drop the gun. J.D. gracefully
text: retrieves it.
speaker_heading: THE GYM
text: The pep assembly is in full swing with rowdy STUDENTS in the
text: bleachers earthily shouting, giggling cheerleaders making
text: swaying pyramids, valiant band members struggling to be heard.
text: Various Jocks, including EARL, stand on the stage with
text: PRINCIPAL GOWAN as a YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER flashes away.
text: THE HALLWAY BEFORE THE BOILER ROOM
text: VERONICA bends over quivering and clutching her bruised ribs.
text: J.D. raises the gun to her head.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Live by the sword...
text: VERONICA swings her left arm up knocking J.D.'s gun hand
text: upward. She then sails her right fist into his face. The blow
text: annoys him more than it hurts him but J.D.'s momentary loss of
text: composure allows VERONICA to come in with another much harder
text: right hook. The blow sends J.D. stumbling back against the
text: boiler room, jarring the gun loose.
text: They simultaneously lunge for the gun. VERONICA, having the
text: better grip, pulls so forecfully that after wrenching the gun
text: from J.D., she loses control of it, flinging it down the hall.
text: VERONICA pops up to retrieve it but J.D. moves his legs
text: scissors-style around her and trips her.
scene_heading: THE PREP ASSEMBLY
text: The assembly mindlessly blares on. Cheerleader HEATHER
text: MCNAMARA rah-rah-rahs. RODNEY and the other Geeks pass around
text: a pair of opera glasses, all intensely scoping out the
text: cheerleaders. A group of STONERS toke away beneath the
text: bleachers, one of them lackadaisically leaning against a
dialog: thermal bomb.
text: THE BOILER ROOM HALLWAY
text: A snarling J.D. stands up, pulling VERONICA with him.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You think just because you started
dialog: this thing, you can end it?
text: J.D. violently kisses/bites VERONICA. While kissing, VERONICA
text: sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. She closes her eyes then
text: savagely knees J.D. in the groin. VERONICA bolts to the alarm
text: and pulls it down. Nothing happens. J.D. gasps.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You, really didn't think I'd, forget,
dialog: forget, to disconnect the....
text: VERONICA rockets her body down and picks up the gun. J.D.
text: grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door.
text: A jostled VERONICA raises the gun. J.D. howls then bounds
text: toward VERONICA, causing them both to careen down the steel
text: steps of the boiler room. At the same time, he inadvertently
text: kicks the gym bag/bomb down along with them. The gun spins
text: from VERONICA's hand and slides away. The bomb flies out of
text: the bag onto the boiler room floor. A digital clock on
text: the bomb clicks on at 5:00....4:59....4:58...
scene_heading: THE PEP ASSEMBLY
text: The frenzied pep assembly crowd is now doing "The Wave". BETTY
text: FINN and her similar co-horts deliriously get into the act,
text: all sit in a circle at the bottom rows of the bleachers,
text: pouting as STUDENTS bounce up and down around them. EARL and
text: the other Jocks stand on the stage grinning and preening
text: before the crowd.
scene_heading: THE BOILER ROOM
text: VERONICA and J.D. are in a heap at the bottom of the boiler
text: room steps. VERONICA faintly works into a semi-sitting
text: position and gives an astonished glance to the bomb, its
text: digital clock clicking to 3:00. VERONICA crawls to the gun and
text: levels it at a rousing-up J.D.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do
dialog: you turn it off? Tell me!
text: Fully standing, J.D. flicks open his switchblade. He gives
text: VERONICA "the finger," screaming in exploded saliva...
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Seething, VERONICA shoots up at J.D. blowing off "the finger."
text: Shrieking in pain, J.D. drops the knife to hold this sudden
text: geyser of blood. VERONICA achingly stands, pointing the gun.
text: The bomb clicks down to 2:25.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You want to wipe the slate clean as
dialog: much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am
dialog: killing everyone in the school
dialog: because nobody loves me. You have a
dialog: purpose though! Remember? Let's face
dialog: it, the only place different social
dialog: types can genuinely get along with
dialog: each other is in heaven.
text: VERONICA fires the gun at J.D.'s feet. The bomb clicks to 1:49.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: How do you turn the fucker off?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You're not listening. People are
text: going to look at the ashes of
dialog: Westerburg and say there's a school
dialog: that self-destructed not because
dialog: society didn't care, but because
dialog: that school was society. Is that
dialog: deep or what? I'll let you put it in
dialog: your diary, babe. Free of charge.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: The bomb, asshole!
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Just push the red button twice.
dialog: That's what stops it. If that's
dialog: what you want, babe?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: You know what I want, babe?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: What?
text: VERONICA fires the gun twice into J.D.'s throat. Coughing and
text: moaning, he splatters against a generator.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Cool guys like you out of my life.
text: VERONICA saunters to J.D.'s writhing body.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: But babe, don't worry, these here
dialog: were Ich Luge bullets.
text: J.D. closes his eyes and slumps to the ground. VERONICA turns
text: to the bomb and crouches over it. A lit green light is next to
text: a green button. Above it, an unlit red light is next to a red
text: button. The bomb's digital clock clicks to 00:17. VERONICA
text: presses the red button twice, turning on the red light and
text: stopping the clock. VERONICA falls back into a sitting
text: position and sorely exhales, tears streaming down her face.
scene_heading: THE PEP ASSEMBLY
text: A cheerleader does a cartwheel in slow motion as eerie music
text: plays. The manic crowd in the bleachers vibrates in slow
dialog: motion as well.
text: At normal speed, VERONICA walks to the doors of the Gym and
text: peers in. The panorama of roaring students, posing jocks, and
text: prancing cheerleaders continues to unfold in slow motion.
text: VERONICA walks away from the gym.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL DAY
text: VERONICA wearily pushes open the front door and emerges
text: outside of the school. She closes her eyes to therapeutically
text: bask in the sun's rays. A slight smile trembles onto her face.
text: A strange voice kills it.
speaker_heading: J.D. (O.S.)
dialog: Color me impressed.
text: J.D. stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting
text: from his throat onto his gunslinger coat. He painfully speaks
text: through his assasinated vocal cords.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You really fucked me up, Veronica.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: (vertigo city)
dialog: I thought I...you..
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You've got power, Veronica. Power I
dialog: didn't think you had. The slate is
dialog: clean.
text: J.D. pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to
text: his torso. The green light is on and the clock says 00:10..00:09.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Pretend I did blow up the school. All
dialog: the schools. Now that you're dead,
dialog: what are you gonna do with your life?
text: VERONICA takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and
text: puts it in her mouth. She then folsd her arms.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Perfecto.
text: J.D. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks
text: to 0:00. Nothing happens. An annoyed J.D. breaks out of his
text: crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.
scene_heading: THE PEP ASSEMBLY
text: The sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up-and-
text: down pep assembly into chaos. Wailing students pour out of the
text: bleachers screaming less out of fear than a "Whoa Dude" sense
text: of excitement.
text: THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL
text: VERONICA stands in the same position in front of the school
text: with her arms still folded. Only now her cigarette is lit and
text: her face and clothes are blackened in ash. Flames flicker in
text: bushes behind her. VERONICA drags on the cigarette and turns
dialog: to go inside.
scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT HALLWAY
text: VERONICA strolls into the school and into a hallway of howling
text: students, some of whom are tearing down Prom banners for the
text: thrill of it. HEATHER DUKE rushes up to VERONICA and grimaces.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: Veronica, you look like hell.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Yeah, I just got back.
text: VERONICA tosses away the cigarette. She then grabs HEATHER
text: DUKE by the shoulders and forcibly turns her around.
scene_heading: HEATHER DUKE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Heather, my love, there's a
text: new sheriff in town.
text: VERONICA takes off HEATHER DUKE's red ribbon and ties it
text: around the hair of her own head. She kisses HEATHER DUKE on
text: the cheek, leaving a black stain. VERONICA calls off.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: Hey, Martha, wait up.
text: MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK revealed to be in an electric
text: wheelchair, brakes to a stop and looks to Veronica, confused.
text: VERONICA walks up beside her. MARTHA starts up her wheelchair
text: and accompanies VERONICA away into a deserted hallway.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: My date for the prom kind of flaked
dialog: out on me, so I thought if you
dialog: weren't doing anything that night
dialog: we could go to the video store and
dialog: rent some new releases or something.
dialog: Maybe pop some popcorn.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I'd like that.
speaker_heading: VERONICA
dialog: So would I.
text: VERONICA and MARTHA continue gliding down the hall
dialog: Bogart/Rains style.
