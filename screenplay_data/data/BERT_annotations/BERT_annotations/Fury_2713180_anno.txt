scene_heading: OVER A BLACK SCREEN:
text: April 1945 -- The Allied Armies strike at the heart of
dialog: Germany. In four weeks the Third Reich will be no more...
scene_heading: EXT. FARMER'S FIELD - PREDAWN
text: Thick morning fog blankets all. A faint glow in the East.
text: It’s quiet save for the DISTANT RUMBLE of artillery.
dialog: Super title: Somewhere in Nazi Germany...
text: A Spanish Arabian STALLION emerges from the fog. A wasp
text: waisted German Army LIEUTENANT erect in its saddle. His
text: disciplined horse elegantly picks its way over the furrowed
text: soil. A dark hulk looms in the mist -- Horse and rider
dialog: approach...
text: IT’S A BURNED OUT TANK -- An American Sherman. Still
text: smoldering. Steel armor ripped open like tin foil.
text: The Lieutenant moves on. Encounters another charred tank. Its
text: entire turret blown off. A small fire still burns inside.
text: Around it are the blackened twisted shapes of burnt shrunken
dialog: men.
text: He moves on. Another hulk emerges from the mist -- This tank
text: looks like a scrap heap -- Sandbags, railroad ties, sloppy
text: steel plate, cases of wine, rations and ammunition. Battered,
text: scarred and seemingly abandoned.
text: The Lieutenant guides his horse in a slow circle around the
text: armored vehicle. He HEARS a faint CLINK -- And draws his
text: Luger from its shiny black holster -- THEN:
text: An AMERICAN SOLDIER hiding BEHIND THE TURRET leaps on him...
text: Tearing the German from his horse. The two men CRASH to the
text: ground. The American stabs the Lieutenant in the face --
text: THWICK-THWICK-THWICK! Fast, violent, shocking...
text: The American then carefully slides the knife blade behind the
text: German’s eye - Piercing his brainpan with a CRACK. The German
text: convulses for a moment. And dies...
text: The American retrieves his knife. Wipes it clean on the
text: German’s uniform and scans the area with burning primal eyes.
text: This is DON “WARDADDY” COLLIER. Late twenties he looks middle
text: aged. A light beard and hollow cheeks. Years of combat have
text: ground him into something hard and sharp.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: With the mechanical clumsiness of exhaustion, Wardaddy cuts
text: the map case from the German’s belt. Then rips the large
text: Knight’s Cross medal from the dead man’s neck.
text: Wardaddy stands to his full impressive height in his oil
text: blackened overalls. He crosses to the horse. He grabs the
text: beautiful animal’s bridal and looks at it for a moment...
text: Eye to eye. Connection with the animal. With incredible
text: gentleness he rubs its muzzle. And kisses it...
text: Then he pulls his knife -- The horse jerks back, but Wardaddy
dialog: holds it firm. He knows horses...
text: THWICK! - He cuts off the bridle, slips the bit from its
text: mouth. He unbuckles the saddle and drops it to the soil.
text: Wardaddy looking at the horse. Then it heads back the way it
dialog: came - Now without ride and tack.
text: Wardaddy climbs aboard his tank -- Her name is “FURY” -- It’s
text: painted on her cannon.
scene_heading: INT. FURY - PREDAWN
text: Dark. Cramped. Crowded. A filthy machine with filthy men.
text: There’s two main areas - THE TURRET BASKET -- A big
text: cylindrical cage that spins with the turret.
text: And the BOW -- The front of the tank where the driver and a
text: machine gunner sit. The sound of piss hitting tin...
text: BOYD “BIBLE” SWAN is draped casually across the cannon
text: breech. A pastor’s kid from Des Moines, he’s serious, calm,
dialog: centered. You’d never guess he’s killed a thousand men. He
text: finishes urinating into an ammo can.
text: TRINI “GORDO” GARCIA sits in the driver’s seat sipping wine
text: from a bottle. A Mexican butcher from Chicago. He’s been
dialog: drunk since 1942. He once went into combat sober - And vowed
dialog: never to do it again.
text: Next to Gordo, the transmission housing between them, is the
text: body of RED. A blood soaked jacket pulled over his head. His
text: blood spattered inside the tank.
text: GRADY “COON-ASS” TRAVIS, a good-old-boy from Arkansas, is
text: wedged into the battery compartment fixing a short. He’s
dialog: cunning, viscous and World wise.

speaker_heading: BIBLE
dialog: Gordo. Stop. Leave him rest.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: He’s dead. Or did you forget? Drunk
dialog: damn fool.
text: Gordo shoots them a dirty look. Keeps whispering to his dead

speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddammit. Ain’t you done?
speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: Keep ridin’ me.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: I’m not riding you. If I was, you’d
dialog: know it. More where he came from.
text: Wardaddy tosses Bible the Knight’s Cross - Bible hangs it in
dialog: the turret - Where more German combat decorations hang like
dialog: Christmas ornaments.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You get some canned bacon for this?
text: He tosses Gordo the dead Officer’s Luger. He inspects it.
speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: For this? Yeah. A case or two.
text: Wardaddy lights a cigarette. Then scratches another notch in
text: his knife with his GI can opener. It’s tense - They are
text: behind German lines and acutely aware of the danger they’re
text: in. But danger becomes routine. After years of it...
text: Coon-Ass smirks - KNOWING he’ll get a rise...

speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: You know what it’s for.

speaker_heading: WARDADDY

speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: Here’s my tool of war.
text: Bible realizes this isn’t about horses or Spanish. It’s about
text: Red -- The man with his head blown off in the Bow Gunner's
text: seat. Bible hands Wardaddy some coffee he warmed on a Coleman
dialog: stove.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Thanks Boyd.
speaker_heading: BIBLE
dialog: Stop ragging on everyone. You

speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: That’s true. But I sure didn’t keep

speaker_heading: BIBLE
dialog: His number came up. That’s all.
dialog: We've been lucky. Until now. Settle
dialog: down.
text: Wardaddy adds sugar to his coffee. Stirs it with a greasy
text: callused finger. He opens the German’s mapcase -- Discovers
dialog: several maps...
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Thank heavens. We got a map.
text: Wardaddy studies a German map...
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: His finely tuned instincts kick in. Wardaddy drops back

speaker_heading: THEN:
text: The sound of ROARING LOCOMOTIVES -- An Artillery barrage is
dialog: on the way...
text: BOOM-BOOM-KABOOM! -- Shells explode around the tank. Rocking
text: it. For the moment the men are safe in their steel cocoon.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Coon-Ass? Anytime, sweetheart.

speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: I'll whip your Alabama ass with my

text: Gordo pushes the starter button. Expectant faces. The engine
text: RUMBLES but doesn’t catch.
text: MORE EXPLODING SHELLS -- Incredibly loud. Shrapnel PINGS off
text: the hull. They endure it with their trademark stoicism.
dialog: They've been through it before - But a direct hit can kill
dialog: them...
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
text: Choke’er up. She’s cold.
text: Gordo opens the choke. Tries again. The engine rumbling.
text: Doesn’t start. Worried faces.
speaker_heading: GORDO

text: key and businesslike, they don their headsets - It’s now
text: unbelievably loud in the tank. Coon-Ass joins Wardaddy and
text: Bible in the turret basket.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Move out!
text: Gordo double-clutches and shifts into first. The tank
text: lurches. Bible presses his eye to the gunsight...
text: Wardaddy rotates the turret with his THUMBSWITCH, looking
text: outside through a PERISCOPE.
text: BEHIND GORDO -- We see the turret basket rotating, the legs
text: of Wardaddy, Bible and Coon-Ass standing inside - It’s an
dialog: impressive sight...
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Forward! Pick it up! Forward!
text: The tank RATTLES. CLANKS and SHUDDERS. Ammo cases, weapons, C-
text: rations vibrate. We are in the belly of the beast.
text: KABOOM-BOOM-BOOM! -- Shells explode dangerously close. The
text: tank shudders. Gordo clutches, shifts into second. Stomps the
text: gas. The tank builds speed. Wardaddy SEES the road...
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Drive! Left. Left. Left.
text: ON GORDO - Turning the tank with the two big steering levers.
text: He whips it onto the road, upshifts into third gear. The tank

text: Gordo can sure drive a tank. Eyes riveted to his periscope.
text: Gas, oil, blood and piss sloshing over his boots. Red’s body
text: in the seat next to him.
text: Leaving the CRASHING artillery behind...
text: Out of immediate danger, Wardaddy opens his hatch and takes
text: his normal position - Exposed from the chest up in the
text: commander's hatch. He grips a captured German assault rifle,
text: grimly scanning for threats with his cold hard eyes.
text: The Fury has escaped. Her crew is neither grateful or
text: relieved. There is work to do. The war is not over...
scene_heading: EXT. BATTALION AREA - DAY
text: A farmer's field has been overrun by a travelling circus of
text: death - An American Armored Battalion. A couple thousand men.
text: A couple hundred vehicles. The TIRED MEN load TIRED VEHICLES
text: for another day on the attack. Months of spearheading into
dialog: Germany have taken their toll.
text: A BOOMING ARTILLERY BATTERY pumps rounds into German targets
text: miles away. The BLACK DRIVERS of the Redball Express Trucks
text: unload heaps of supplies from their trucks.
text: MECHANICS, CLERKS, COOKS and MPs move with purpose.
text: INFANTRYMEN clean weapons. A CHAPLAIN gives last rites
text: outside the surgery tent as MEDICS line up more litters of
scene_heading: WOUNDED MEN.
text: A hundred GERMAN PRISONERS sit listlessly behind barbed wire.
text: A BULLDOZER plows a heap of dead Germans into a pit.
text: A ROW OF FIFTEEN SHERMAN TANKS -- Their busy CREWS ready them

text: HERE COMES THE FURY -- Driving up fast, it deftly spins and

text: DAVIS, commander of the Lucy Sue shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SGT. DAVIS
dialog: Thought you were dead Collier.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY

speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)

text: Two Platoon Soldiers are hit and drop - The Machine gun is

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: WARDADDY

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Sure, Sergeant. It wasn’t nothing.

dialog: 55.
scene_heading: INT. GERMAN TOWN - NAZI HEADQUARTERS - DAY
text: Wardaddy pushes the door open. He and Norman gaze upon a

speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: They knew we were coming. So they

scene_heading: INT. GERMAN TOWN - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Wardaddy quickly charges up the stairs...
text: Norman follows. They reach an apartment door on the top

text: on her face is plain as day.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Who's in here?
speaker_heading: IRMA
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Just me.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Bullshit.
text: Wardaddy forces his way inside.
scene_heading: INT. GERMAN TOWN - WOMAN’S APARTMENT - DAY
text: It has surprisingly modern furniture and decor. Wardaddy
text: quickly searches the place. Norman follows his around like a

text: SOMEONE is hiding underneath.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Get out of there. Right now. Hurry
dialog: up.
text: Norman watches a gorgeous young lady slide out from under the

speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Get me some hot water. For shaving.
dialog: (to Norman)
dialog: Sit the fuck down. Put the gun

speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Emma, you know how to cook?
text: The girl nods: yes. Wardaddy reaches in his musette bag. Digs

text: Precious rare eggs.
text: Then he takes out a can of coffee. And a can of bacon. He
text: offers the rare treasures to Emma. Her eyes light up and she
text: joyfully accepts them. As a bonus Wardaddy gives her two
text: packs of smokes. She happily joins Irma in the kitchen.
text: Norman relaxes. Wardaddy isn’t here to rape and kill them.
text: Norman takes off his helmet. And takes off his jacket.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: INT. GERMAN TOWN - WOMAN’S APARTMENT
text: In the kitchen - Irma savouring an American cigarette as she

dialog: The first in years.
text: Norman is asleep on the couch. Wardaddy stands before a pot

text: steaming cup of coffee. Norman smiles at her. He likes her.
text: She smiles back. She likes him. She sits next to him. Thigh
dialog: to thigh.
text: Norman SEES Wardaddy’s burns and REACTS - Embarrassed by
text: them, Wardaddy puts his shirt back on.
text: Emma holds Norman’s hand. Then tries to pull him off the

text: shakes his head: no.
text: Wardaddy slides a fresh blade in his safety razor.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: She's a good clean girl. You don’t
dialog: take her in that bedroom, I will.
text: Emma intuits what Wardaddy has said and clings to Norman's
dialog: arm.
text: Norman looks at Wardaddy. At the girl. Wardaddy doesn’t
text: really want her. But Norman doesn’t know that. Norman makes
text: his decision. He leads Emma into the bedroom. She shuts the

text: Wardaddy smiles. Like a proud big brother. He works up a good

text: NEW ANGLE - Irma steps out of the kitchen, arms crossed, with

speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: (in German)

dialog: was sixteen. And looked just like
dialog: you. With the same “I’m smarter

dialog: was on fire. Yep, like a real
text: shithead. Pedal to the mat. Hit an
dialog: ice patch and flipped it. I got

scene_heading: EXT. HAY FIELD - DAY
text: KABOOM! - the round punches through the soft armor in the

text: The ammunition insides EXPLODES. The Tiger shudders to a

text: The DRIVER tries to escape. But the flames are too intense.
text: He’s incinerated right before Wardaddy’s eyes...

speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Radio’s are eighty-sixed. We’re on
dialog: our lonesome until Baker Company

speaker_heading: GORDO

speaker_heading: COON-ASS

text: Coon-Ass wasn’t trying to be funny. He’s shaken to his core.
text: Wardaddy lets them vent. He passes Gordo a bottle of brandy.
text: Gordo takes it and downs a long swig.
text: Wardaddy SEES Norman sitting there quietly. Covered with
text: hydraulic oil and blood. Staring into space.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Having a good time, kid?
text: Norman looks at Wardaddy and shakes his head thinking “What

speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BIBLE

speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: We got a job to do. We can sit here

dialog: about it there. I don’t see a hell
dialog: of a lot of difference, do you?
speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: That's real inspiring. Shit, now I
dialog: wanna storm the gates of Hell and
text: snatch Satan off his throne by his
dialog: balls.
text: Norman turns to Wardaddy and deadpans:
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: That’s not really true. He just
dialog: said it to be an asshole.
text: Norman just took the sarcasm to another level. The veteran
text: tankers stare at Norman -- He is becoming one of them...
scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - DUSK
text: The sun is setting. The Fury moves up the road approaching
text: the rural tree lined intersection with an OLD HOUSE and a
text: BEER HALL - There isn’t a soul in sight.
text: Wardaddy scans the terrain with his binoculars. He’s looking
text: for a good spot to park the Fury for the night. The tank is
text: moving through the intersection.
text: BOOM! - The Fury runs over a mine - The explosion lifts the
text: tank and drops it. The broken left track falls off the drive
dialog: wheel...
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. FURY (MOVING)
text: It was a damn hard whack -- Dust and smoke fill the interior.
text: Rations and ammunition spill from its racks. SPARKING
dialog: electrical shorts.
speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: Fuck! Another Tiger!
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Calm down. It’s a mine. We hit a
dialog: mine is all.
text: Gordo shakes it off. The engine stalls. He restarts it. Puts

speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: We threw a track.
scene_heading: EXT. FURY - DUSK

speaker_heading: COON-ASS

dialog: too.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: You fix it?
speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: Yeah. Why not?
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Norman! Get out here!
text: Norman exits his hatch - He’s afraid to jump down to the
dialog: road...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What about mines?
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: They're for vehicles. You ain’t

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

scene_heading: INT. OLD HOUSE - DUSK

text: Both men freeze...
text: WHAT THEY SEE - The interior of the house is filled with
text: mines. Big round anti-tank mines to be exact. Stacks of them.
text: It’s being used as a munitions depot.
text: Coon-Ass slowly backs out of there...
speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: Don’t touch nothin’.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Not planning on it.
scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - DUSK
text: Gordo and Bible have started unbolting a section of track
text: from Fury’s side. Coon-Ass shouts to Wardaddy:
speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: Whole thing’s full of mines. Good
dialog: thing you didn’t shoot the shit out
dialog: of it or we'd be drinking whiskey
dialog: with Jesus.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Maybe I will anyway. I could use a
dialog: drink. Keep going. What’s in the
dialog: other house?
scene_heading: INT. BEER HALL - DUSK
text: WHAM! Coon-Ass kicks the door. Enters with Norman.
dialog: This place is disturbing in a different way. There is dried
text: blood everywhere. Bandages. Medical supplies. Cut off bloody
text: uniforms and boots. Amputated limbs. Flesh. Organs. And a
text: half-dozen DEAD GERMAN SOLDIERS who succumbed to battle
text: wounds. This was a temporary field hospital.
speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: At least there ain’t no live Krauts

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Can we go now?
scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - DUSK
text: Coon-Ass and Norman return to the Fury. Gordo uses a track

speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: Naw, nothing.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Kid, head up by those trees. You go

text: Norman nods and heads up the road.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD SENTRY POSITION - NIGHT
text: Norman sits in the roadside ditch. He checks his greasegun.
text: It’s loaded. He sets it in his lap.
text: He adds drink powder to his canteen. Shakes it. He opens a
text: can of crackers with his little GI can opener. He chews the
text: hard crackers and washes them down with his canteen.
text: He yawns widely. He’s physically and emotionally drained from
text: his first day as a US Army tanker.
text: After being in a tank he feels so alone and exposed out here.
text: He HEARS something. Scared, he raises his ugly black weapon.
text: It’s just an OWL in the trees. Norman relaxes. He can’t keep
text: his eyes open. His head falls toward his chest. His heavy
text: eyelids close. And he falls asleep.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD SENTRY POSITION - NIGHT
text: LATER - Norman startles awake. Gasping for breath. Dreaming
text: he was shot. He checks himself for holes. And relaxes - It
dialog: was just a dream...
text: He berates himself for falling asleep. He gets on his knees.
text: To a less comfortable position.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Then he freezes. And his eyes grow wide.
text: WHAT NORMAN SEES - Moving toward him along the dark road is a
text: long column of silhouettes.
text: GERMAN SOLDIERS - Marching toward him. A lot of them. More
dialog: than he’s ever seen. There are several hundred. And there’s
text: something about the way they move. Theses aren’t shuffling
text: demoralized conscripts. These are health, well equipped
text: combat troops - And they are heading his way...
text: Norman thinks for a moment. He has to warn the others...
text: He gets low and slowly backs down the ditch...
scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT
text: Gordo, Coon-Ass and Bible work on repairing the track.
text: Wardaddy sits in the turret, a deadly alert sentry with big
text: machine gun. He can’t see the approaching men.
text: Here comes Norman at a full run...
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Why good evening, Norman. Why
dialog: aren’t you at your post?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: They're coming.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Who's coming?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: The Germans
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: More than I can count.
text: Wardaddy climbs down from the turret.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: I’m sure it’s some bums looking for
dialog: someone to surrender to.
dialog: (to Coon-Ass)
dialog: Keep working. I'll be right back.
text: Wardaddy and Norman head up the road...
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD SENTRY POSITION - NIGHT
text: Wardaddy and Norman move low along the ditch. Wardaddy SEES
text: the approaching troops - Silhouettes in the darkness. He can
text: just hear their hobnailed boots CRUNCHING the road.
text: He grabs Norman’s arm and drags him out of there.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: -+. C'mon...
scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT
text: Wardaddy and Norman come running.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: There’s a goddamned SS battalion

speaker_heading: GORDO
dialog: Bullshit.
text: Bible sees he’s dead serious...
speaker_heading: BIBLE
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Marching this way.

speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: Let’s get out of here. They’1l

dialog: pass through.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: We’re not running. We’re fighting

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: No I don’t want to. But it’s what

text: Wardaddy climbs aboard the Fury. His jaw tenses. It’s okay
text: with him. He double checks his .50 Cal.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on. Get outta here.
text: Norman looks at the other guys. Then at Wardaddy. He crosses
text: to the Fury and stands by it, looking at the others with
text: crossed arms.
text: With that show of bravery, Gordo, Coon-Ass and Bible have no
text: choice but to follow suit. The three men approach the Fury.
dialog: No one has any illusions - This somber, sober choice means
dialog: their deaths.
text: Wardaddy smiles. As much of a smile as he can muster. Then
dialog: he’s all business.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re gonna play dead, like we’ve
dialog: done before. Let ‘em march right
dialog: up. Then open up with all we got
text: and splatter the assholes all over
dialog: the road.
dialog: (to Coon-Ass)
dialog: Grab us one of them dead Krauts.
speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: We gonna have a pig roast?
speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Something like that.
text: Coon-Ass rushes off toward the Old House...
text: Wardaddy grabs his knife and cuts several packs and
text: dufflebags off the tank. He hands Norman a gas can...
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Give ‘em a good soaking.
text: Norman pours the gas on them. Gordo grabs extra boxes of ammo
text: from the storage racks and shoves them into the tank.
text: Bible is in the turret singing a hymn. He resets the fuzes on
text: the cannon shells for close-in work. He wipes the main gun
text: breech down. Cleans his optics. Oils the machine gun.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Here comes Coon-Ass dragging a body...
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hurry up with that sack ‘a shit.

text: of the tank. Pulls off his jacket and puts it on the body.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Toss me that helmet.
text: Norman tosses him an American helmet. Wardaddy straps it on
text: the corpse’s head. He grabs the gas can from Norman. Splashes
text: the body with it. Wardaddy lights a smoke with a match. Then
text: tosses the match on the body - FWOOMP!
text: Wardaddy lights another match and tosses it on the packs in
text: the road - FWOOMP! Satisfied, he surveys his work.
speaker_heading: WARDADDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now they ain’t gonna see nothing
text: but a shot-out tank with a blown
dialog: track. Get it. Button up.
text: The men slip into the Fury and close the hatches. It looks
text: like a bigger shit pile than when we first saw it, bathed in
text: the firelight of the burning packs and the German corpse.
text: Debris scattered around it, a broken track...
scene_heading: INT. FURY - NIGHT
text: Norman lines up boxes of ammunition for his machine gun. He
text: wipes the gun with a rag. Gordo loads his submachine-gun.
text: Stacks up extra magazines.
text: He opens a case of grenades and removes their safety clips --
text: Pausing to swig from his bottle of brandy. Coon-Ass organizes
text: the main gun rounds.
speaker_heading: COON-ASS
dialog: We got four rounds of cannister.
dialog: Four Willy Petes. Twenty three

speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: Might as well get a little tight.

speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: God that’s better than good. Like
text: warm honey dripping on my heart.
text: He offers Bible the bottle. Bible takes it. He meditates on
text: the demon liquor a beat. Then:
speaker_heading: BIBLE
dialog: I know you hate me preaching, but
dialog: what we're doing is a righteous
dialog: act. There’s a bible verse I think
dialog: about sometimes. Then I heard the
dialog: voice of the Lord saying, “Whom
dialog: shall I send? And who will go for
dialog: us?” And I said, “Here am I. Send
dialog: me.”
text: That resonated. Bible sees it on the faces of the men.

speaker_heading: BIBLE

scene_heading: WARDADDY'S PERISCOPE POV - The column of SS TROOPERS is

scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. FURY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: WARDADDY
dialog: I’m sorry, Boyd. I did my best.

scene_heading: EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SS OFFICER
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Let’s go! We’re behind schedule!
dialog: Move it! Hurry up! Let’s move!
text: The Young Trooper turns off the light. He stands and walks

text: Norman tries to be one with the roadbed.
text: The Trooper lays down - CLICK - Shines the light directly in
text: Norman’s face. He’s been discovered.
text: ON THE YOUNG TROOPER - Now we see his face. He’s a kid,

text: There’s Wardaddy. Sitting there. The grenades have made a

text: something he already knew. Then he sets it down.
text: Norman finds Wardaddy’s knife on the floor of the turret
text: basket. He picks up the knife and runs his thumb along all
