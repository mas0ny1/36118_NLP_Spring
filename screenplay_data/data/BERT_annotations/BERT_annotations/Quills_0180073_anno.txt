speaker_heading: IN THE BLACKNESS
dialog: The hypnotic voice of a master story-teller:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Reader...I've a naughty tale to
dialog: tell, plucked from the pages of
dialog: history. Tarted up, true, but
dialog: guaranteed to stimulate the senses...
speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
text: A STORM-TOSSED SKY Rising into the frame, a YOUNG WOMAN's
text: FACE. Her hair whips about in the wind; her face is
dialog: brittle...beautiful...and as engimatic as St. Theresa. Is
dialog: she in ecstasy, or in pain?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (V.O.)
dialog: The story of Mademoiselle Renard, a
dialog: ravishing young aristocrat, whose
dialog: sexual proclivities ran the gamut
dialog: from winsome to bestial. Who doesn't
dialog: dream of indulging every spasm of
dialog: lust, feeding each depraved hunger?
text: MALE FINGERS appear at MADEMOISELLE RENARD's collarbone;
text: they start to trace the delicate curve of her neck; her
text: decolletage...MADEMOISELLE seems to writhe, to twist...
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Owing to her noble birth, Mademoiselle
dialog: Renard was granted full immunity to
dialog: do just that, inflicting pain and
dialog: pleasure with equal zest, until one
dialog: day--
text: Suddenly, ANOTHER FACE enters the frame; a BRUTISH FIGURE
text: WITH A NEANDERTHAL FACE in a roughly sewn leather hood.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Mademoiselle found herself at the
dialog: mercy of a man whose skill in the
dialog: Art of Pain exceeded her own...
text: The WOMAN's eyes flare with fear. There's no question as to
text: her emotion now; she is terrified. The DARK FIGURE forcefully
text: pulls down her dress, revealing the pale skin of her
dialog: shoulders.
text: ANGLE ON: THE WOMAN'S HANDS. The MAN secures them behind her
text: back, and tightens leather bindings around her arms; they
text: cut into her flesh. He gathers her hair gently in his gloved
text: hands, then--viciously--he yanks her head back.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 2
text: ECU: THE WOMAN'S FACE. She gasps, her eyes thrust upward.
text: She's in a courtyard of some kind. And--in an enormous tower,
text: standing behind a barred window, the SHADOWY FIGURE OF A
dialog: PRISONER, his hands in irons.
dialog: TITLE CARD: "Picpus Prison outside Paris. 1794."
text: TIGHT SHOT: The eyes of the PRISONER, watching the grisly
dialog: proceedings below.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: How easily, dear Reader, one changes
dialog: from predator to prey! And how swiftly
dialog: pleasure is taken from some and given
dialog: to others!
dialog: ANGLE ON: THE WOMAN as the MASKED MAN--her executioner--
text: lowers her head into the grooved block of the guillotine.
text: WOMAN's POV: Rows and rows of faces are stare up at her, the
text: jaunty red caps of the JACOBINS interspersed throughout. The
text: CROWD is eerily silent. They seem to be waiting like vultures,
dialog: ready to descend once blood is shed.
text: Near-by, the BODIES OF FRESHLY KILLED ARISTOCRATS are tossed--
text: like refuse--into a cart. MEN stand among the dead, foraging
dialog: for stray riches. An OLD HAG wrestles to pull a gold ring
text: off a wayward, stiff hand.
text: CLOSE UP: THE WOMAN'S FACE in shock. A DROP OF BLOOD lands
text: on her cheek from above..The CAMERA sweeps UP, UP, UP, past
text: the looming EXECUTIONER, all the way to the GLINTING BLADE
dialog: OF THE GUILLOTINE, blood from the previous victim dripping
dialog: from its edge.
scene_heading: TOP SHOT OF THE WOMAN, HER HEAD POISED FOR DECAPITATION
text: The basket waits below; blood seeps through the wicker onto
text: the cobblestones and beneath the FEET of the THRONG.
speaker_heading: THE PRISON TOWER
text: The PRISONER turns away from the grisly proceedings below.
text: MASTER SHOT: THE GUILLOTINE LOOMS ABOVE THE CROWD
text: ANGLE ON: QUILLS, RIPPLING IN THE BREEZE
text: Through a tiny window, THE PRISONER sits with his back to
text: us, hunched over his desk in a silk dressing gown. A lush
text: wig trails in ringlets down his back. He writes, furiously.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 3
scene_heading: ANGLE ON: THE BLADE, TREMBLING, READY TO FALL
text: THE EXECUTIONER jiggles the rope, and--with a terrible,
text: rumbling gravity--the blade breaks free--wobbling wildly--
dialog: accelerating in speed--
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: THE PRISONER'S QUILL
text: as he dips it into a crimson ink-well. Issuing from the depths
dialog: of his soul, an odd sound indeed; a little tune with the
dialog: sing-song cadences of a children's nursery rhyme:
text: Claire de la Lune. Outside his window, the BLOODTHIRSTY ROAR
speaker_heading: OF THE MASSES.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: THE GUILLOTINE
dialog: The blade falls--down, down, down--aiming right for the woman--
dialog: the tender flesh of her exposed neck---faster--faster--until:
text: THE SCREEN SPLASHES BLOOD RED. A SICKENING CRUNCH, followed
speaker_heading: by a dull THUD.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CHARENTON.
text: A DIAGONAL PATCH OF RED SLIDES OPEN, AND WE SEE THE EYES OF
dialog: A YOUNG GIRL, staring straight at us:
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Your linens, please.
dialog: CARD: "The Charenton Asylum for the Insane; Years Later."
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUED
text: MADELEINE, on tip toe, stares through the peephole of a cell
text: door, her laundry basket on her hip. She's a sweet faced
text: naif with a dirt-smudged face and plenty of spirit.
text: A trap in the lower half of the door opens, and through it
text: an unseen hand pushes a bundle of dirty bedsheets.
text: MADELEINE gathers them in her basket and moves to the next
dialog: cell.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Your linens.
text: VALCOUR, the asylum's prefect, leads a bald, effeminate
dialog: lunatic named PITOU from his cell for a morning
dialog: "constitutional." MADELEINE skirts past them both.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 4
speaker_heading: VALCOUR
speaker_heading: (to MADELEINE)
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: G'morning.
text: She reaches the last door, and glances anxiously up and down
text: the hallway before sliding open the peephole.
dialog: MADELEINE'S POV: The PRISONER--over a decade older--is still
text: hunched over his desk, composing to his heart's content. His
text: silk robe is tattered, and his wig is thin with age.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Pss. 'S me.
text: A bundle of sheets tumbles out the trap. MADELEINE kneels.
dialog: There's something bulky hidden in the cloth: a manuscript,
text: written in an ornate hand.
speaker_heading: VOICE OF THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
dialog: (mellifluous and low)
dialog: Careful. The ink's still wet.
text: The peephole slides open from inside; a single eye stares
text: out, bloodshot and reptilian.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Now hurry.
text: MADELEINE smiles a mischievous smile, then moves on her way.
scene_heading: INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: She empties the dirty sheets into an enormous pile, then
text: plucks the manuscript from the bottom of the basket, and
text: conceals it under her shawl. Her MOTHER--an older woman with
text: milky white eyes--stands over a steaming vat of boiling lye.
text: She stirs a twisted mass of linens with her long, forked
text: laundry pole. Blindness prevents her from seeing MADELEINE,
dialog: but she hears her nonetheless:
speaker_heading: MADAME LECLERC
dialog: That you, Maddy?
text: MADELEINE hoists up a basket of clean, wet laundry. She says
dialog: with feigned innocence:
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Yes, Mother. Just taking the bleached
dialog: ones out to dry.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 5
scene_heading: EXT. CHARENTON COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hanging sheets, two chambermaids: MICHETTE and CHARLOTTE,
dialog: the first as comely as the second is dour. Hastily, MADELEINE
text: drops off her basket of wet linens.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Aren't you going to lend us a hand,
dialog: then?
dialog: But MADELEINE's already disappeared.
scene_heading: EXT. CHARENTON--THE TERRACE AND GROUNDS
text: MADELEINE dodges past PATIENTS, basking in the morning light,
text: clutching the hidden manuscript tightly to her breast. PITOU
text: combs imaginary locks with a silver hair-brush; OTHER LUNATICS
text: toss a leather ball in a game of catch.
text: As MADELEINE careens around an enormous hedge, she practically
text: runs into THE EXECUTIONER from the opening sequence: BOUCHON.
dialog: His grim duties during the Terror have since landed him in
dialog: the madhouse. MADELEINE can feel the manuscript slipping
text: under her shawl and scrambles to catch it before it drops.
text: When she tries to dodge BOUCHON, he blocks her way.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Bouchon!
dialog: MADELEINE looks up to see--sure enough--the ABBE de COULMIER,
text: the asylum's administrator. He's surprisingly young with
text: lustrous eyes and a handsome face.
dialog: He calls to the LUNATIC, sternly:
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Remember your manners.
text: BOUCHON offers a shy smile, sans most of his teeth. Then--
text: with great solemnity--he bows low for MADELEINE to pass.
text: She mouths "thank-you" to COULMIER, then scurries on.
text: ANGLE ON: THE ABBE DE COULMIER, watching MADELEINE go. He
text: gazes out at the Elysium spread before him. He can't disguise
dialog: his satisfaction; Charenton is a good place, a happy place.
text: EXT. A PAVILION ON THE EDGE OF THE GROUNDS - MORNING.
text: Out-of-breath, MADELEINE reaches the front gate. She glances
text: nervously to and fro, then slips the manuscript through the
text: bars to a waiting HORSEMAN.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 6
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Here it is; the last chapter.
speaker_heading: HORSEMAN
dialog: Monsieur Masse says he'd like another
dialog: manuscript, quick as you please.
dialog: He's got himself three presses, and
dialog: he can't print 'em fast enough.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: I'll pass the word on, then.
speaker_heading: HORSEMAN
dialog: I'll pay you another visit, with a
dialog: share of the profits, once its sold.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: I'll be waiting.
speaker_heading: HORSEMAN
dialog: (grinning flirtatiously)
dialog: Maybe someday you'll tell me your
dialog: name.
text: MADELEINE coquettishly arches an eyebrow. The HORSEMAN rears
text: his steed, then charges away in a cloud of dust.
speaker_heading: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
speaker_heading: CU: A HUGE WOODEN CRATE.
text: A BLACK MARKETEER pries the lid off with a crowbar.Inside,
text: stacks of newly-bound volumes embossed with the title Justine.
speaker_heading: BLACK MARKETEER
dialog: This just in; the very latest from
dialog: the Marquis de Sade!
text: WELL-DRESSED CUSTOMERS snake their way down the grimy street.
dialog: The MEN hide their faces behind high collars; the WOMEN wear
text: veiled hats. Money changes hands; books fly from the box.
dialog: Trade is brisk.
scene_heading: EXT. FOP STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: A CROWD has secretly gathered: a MILLINER, a BLACKSMITH, a
text: BUTCHER, and a SOCIETY FOP, to name a few. A STREET URCHIN
text: keeps an eye out for passing police. The FOP reads from the
dialog: book in a loud whisper:
speaker_heading: FOP
dialog: "Our story concerns a nymph named
dialog: Justine, as pretty a maid as ever
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 7
speaker_heading: FOP (CONT'D)
dialog: entered a nunnery, with a body so
dialog: firm and ripe, it seemed a shame to
dialog: commit it to God..."
scene_heading: INT. THE EMPEROR'S PALACE - DAY
text: CLOSE UP: THE BOOK as THE FOP'S VOICE bleeds into another,
dialog: more stentorian ONE:
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: "One morning, the Bishop placed his
dialog: hand upon her thigh. 'Holy Father!,'
dialog: cried she, 'I've come to confess my
dialog: sins, not commit them anew!'"
speaker_heading: PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
text: A CABINET MINISTER--MONSIEUR Delbené--reads aloud.
text: NAPOLEON listens, surrounded by his retinue: MINISTERS,
text: GUARDS, a PAINTER, a SCULPTOR and TWO GAUNT TAILORS--mouths
dialog: rimmed with pins--who trim his ermine cape.
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ
dialog: "heedless, the old priest turned her
text: over on his knee and lifted her skirts
dialog: high above her hips, exposing the
dialog: pink flesh of her backside. There--
dialog: between the orbs of her dimpled ass--
dialog: lay a blushing rosebud, begging to
dialog: be...plucked."
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ clears his throat.
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ (CONT'D)
dialog: "Before Justine could wrestle from
dialog: his grasp, this most ungodly man
dialog: took a communion wafer--the body of
dialog: our Lord Jesus Christ--and placed it
dialog: on the girl's twitching orifice--"
dialog: Must I, Your Majesty?
text: The PAINTER, THE SCULPTOR and THE TAILORS are on tenterhooks;
speaker_heading: NAPOLEON merely arches an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ (CONT'D)
dialog: "As he loosened his manhood from
dialog: beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered
dialog: a Latin prayer. And then--with a
dialog: mighty thrust--drove it into her
dialog: very entrails--"
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 8
speaker_heading: NAPOLEON
dialog: (interrupting at last)
dialog: Enough!
text: THE EMPEROR grabs the book from Delbené.
speaker_heading: NAPOLEON (CONT'D)
dialog: Seize every copy; we'll torch them
dialog: all on the palace lawn, in full public
dialog: view.
text: NAPOLEON tosses it into the fireplace. For a blistering
dialog: moment, we see the book's title: Justine, by Anonymous. It
text: explodes into a ball of flame.
speaker_heading: NAPOLEON (CONT'D)
dialog: As for the author...shoot him.
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ
dialog: A word of caution, Sire: we all
dialog: remember what happened to Robespierre,
dialog: Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to
dialog: death, and history might even regard
dialog: you as a despot.
speaker_heading: NAPOLEON
dialog: But I am history.
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ
dialog: Of course, Your Highness.
dialog: Nevertheless...cure the Marquis de
dialog: Sade...succeed, where countless
dialog: physicians and priests have failed...
speaker_heading: NAPOLEON
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ
dialog: (sly)
dialog: No one can fault Napoleon for merely
dialog: bringing a man to his senses.
dialog: NAPOLEON gets it; he smiles. This DELBENÉ is clever; very
text: clever indeed. DELBENÉ smiles back; it's a plan.
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ (CONT'D)
dialog: Might I suggest that we order an
dialog: appraisal of the Charenton Asylum,
dialog: and the rather notorious inmate in
dialog: her care. I've the perfect candidate
dialog: for the job: Doctor Royer-Collard,
dialog: the distinguished alienist. He's a
dialog: staunchly moral man of impeccable
dialog: character and iron resolve--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 9
scene_heading: INT. TREATMENT ROOM AT THE HOTEL DIEU
text: CLOSE UP: A BLITHERING MADMAN with wild eyes and a drooling
text: lower-lip. With a LURCH, he tips backwards. His head is
text: submerged in a pool of icy blue water. He puckers and gasps
dialog: for air.
text: Reflected in the pool, the face of DR. ROYER-COLLARD, an
text: immaculately groomed gentleman, in his fifties with a square
text: jaw. He looks down at the waterlogged LUNATIC with chilling
dialog: satisfaction.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: My colleagues have called me old-
dialog: fashioned; even barbaric.
speaker_heading: PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
text: The LUNATIC is strapped into a chair with a collapsible back.
text: When ROYER-COLLARD gives the signal--an imperious nod--a
dialog: POCKMARKED ATTENDANT--the DOCTOR'S footman, GAILLON-- cranks
text: the lever, and the LUNATIC flips backward into a "calming
dialog: pool." The effect is anything but. As the MADMAN flounders,
dialog: ROYER-COLLARD explains to Delbené:
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor
dialog: an...aggressive...course of treatment.
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ
dialog: Quite.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: I don't seek popularity or renown,
dialog: Monsieur Delbenè. Mine is a higher
dialog: mission.
text: ROYER-COLLARD gives the signal again. GAILLON raises the
text: lever, and the GOON surges upright, his ribcage heaving.
text: ROYER-COLLARD strides up to the PATIENT and regards him with
text: sanctimony. The MADMAN quivers under his gaze.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: To take God's tiny blunders...those
dialog: He has forsaken...and condition them
dialog: with the same force...the same
dialog: rigor...you would employ to train a
dialog: feral dog or wild stallion.
text: Another nod, another crank, and--with a scream of protest--
text: the LUNATIC is again lowered into the pool.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 10
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: It may not be pretty, but it is mercy
dialog: just the same.
text: Splashing and gurgling; Delbené shouts above the tumult:
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ
dialog: It's the Emperor's dearest hope that
dialog: you might bring your expertise--your
dialog: proficiency--to the Charenton asylum--
text: ROYER-COLLARD tastes the idea for a moment.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Charenton? The administrator there
dialog: is quite well-loved, is he not?
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ
dialog: I'm afraid so; he's an idealist.
dialog: You'll have to be politic.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Do you know how I define "idealism,"
dialog: Monsieur Delbenè?
text: Delbené waits for an answer; the DOCTOR's eyes twinkle.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Youth's final luxury.
text: ROYER-COLLARD emits a knowing laugh. Delbené joins him.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SINISTER GATES OF THE HOTEL DIEU - LATER
text: They swing open with a deafening clang, and a DARK CARRIAGE
text: bursts forth. Riding atop it, a pock-marked footman named
text: GAILLON. Its curtains are drawn and it moves at a hell-bent
dialog: pitch. Strapped to the back, the "calming" chair.
scene_heading: INT. CHARENTON CHAPEL - DAY
text: ONE HAND, GENTLY GUIDING ANOTHER over script written on
dialog: parchment. COULMIER teaches MADELEINE penmanship; together,
dialog: they copy a page from St. Augustine's City of God.
text: MADELEINE can't help glancing at COULMIER from the corner of
text: her eye: such a virile man dressed in the chaste robes of a
dialog: monk. An intriguing contradiction.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Of course, we mustn't just copy the
dialog: words; it's important that we know
dialog: what they mean. St. Augustine tells
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 11
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: us that angels and demons walk among
dialog: us on the earth; that sometimes,
dialog: they jointly inhabit the soul of a
dialog: single man...
text: MADELEINE can feel his breath on her neck. She turns to him
dialog: and asks with innocent eyes wide:
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Then how can we know who is truly
dialog: good, and who is evil?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: We can't. All we can do is guard
dialog: against our own corruption.
text: Self-conscious now, COULMIER draws back.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll practice reading tonight on
dialog: your own? For me?
dialog: MADELEINE nods. Indeed she will.
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - CHARENTON - NIGHT
dialog: Lollygagging in straw, FOUR RIPE ADOLESCENTS: GUERIN, the
text: stable boy, his shirt open in the heat from the near-by
dialog: laundry vats; MICHETTE, the scullery maid, tumbling out of
dialog: her corset; LOUISON, the groundkeeper's son, in his
text: nightshirt; CHARLOTTE, primly buttoned to the neck; and
text: MADELEINE. As she "practices reading" from a few stray sheets
dialog: of parchment, the OTHERS listen enrapt:
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: "And so the Professor lifted Colombe's
dialog: skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me
dialog: be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the
dialog: ways of love.' With that, he slid
dialog: her pantalettes down, down, down
dialog: over her knees, and there--nestled
dialog: between her.legs--as pink as a tulip,
dialog: as slick as an eel--"
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: We oughtn't be reading his nasty
dialog: stories--
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: No one's forcing you to listen.
text: The TWO GIRLS lock eyes; CHARLOTTE burns with humiliation.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 12
text: Slowly, she sinks back to her place on the ground. Even she
dialog: can't resist THE MARQUIS' prose.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (with satisfaction)
dialog: Very well then.
dialog: MADELEINE re-settles, resuming her story:
speaker_heading: MADELEINE (CONT'D)
dialog: "...he gazed upon Her Venus mound;
dialog: her flaxen quim; the winking eye of
dialog: God."
text: GUERIN nuzzles MICHETTE's neck; CHARLOTTE glances at LOUISON
text: hopefully; he ignores her. She pouts, then interrupts again:
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: You've been to his quarters, haven't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Once or twice.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I hear he's got a whetstone and
dialog: chisel, and he uses them to sharpen
dialog: his teeth.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: He's a writer, not a madman.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: Then what's he doing here?
speaker_heading: LOUISON
dialog: Murder.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: That's not so!
speaker_heading: LOUISON
dialog: He writes books so wicked--so black
dialog: with evil--that one man killed his
dialog: wife, after reading 'em...
speaker_heading: GUERIN
dialog: And two young mothers miscarried
dialog: their babies!
speaker_heading: LOUISON
dialog: I'd say that's murder enough.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 13
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: If you're going to slander him, then
dialog: you don't deserve to hear his stories--
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: (an accusation)
dialog: I think she's sweet on him, that's
dialog: what I think.
text: GUERIN--meanwhile--has groped beneath MICHETTE's blouse and
text: now fondles her breast. She purrs and glances at MADELEINE
dialog: with a little half-smile:
speaker_heading: MICHETTE
dialog: It's not the Marquis she's sweet on;
dialog: Is it, Madeleine?
text: MADELEINE gives MICHETTE a playful slap, and the TWO GIRLS
dialog: burst into giggles.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON: THE LINEN PANTRY, A FEW FEET AWAY
text: In the wall, the discernible shape of an old wooden door
dialog: with wrought-iron hinges. Clearly, it was once a portal,.but
dialog: it was plastered shut long ago. In its knotty, rotting wood--
text: where the hinge meets the stone--a tiny gap. Peeping through
text: it--spying on the FOURSOME--BOUCHON. A low GRUNT as he
dialog: pleasures himself in the dark.
scene_heading: EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
text: The HORSES' HOOVES of the DOCTOR's carriage cut into the
text: dirt; mud flies as it barrels on its way.
scene_heading: INT. A CORRIDOR IN CHARENTON - THE NEXT MORNING
text: MADELEINE is slipping fresh linen through the traps in each
text: cell door. She reaches the last one.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Fresh linens.
text: A HAND reaches out to grab hers. It's heavily powdered, and
text: wears an amber ring with an arachnid trapped in stone.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
dialog: I'm hungry for a proper visit.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: (holding her own)
dialog: Don't start--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 14
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
dialog: Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it
dialog: through my tiny hole...
text: The HAND lets her go. MADELEINE rises, cautiously looking
text: about. She reaches into her apron pocket and pulls out a
text: key. She inserts it in the lock; it turns.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: MADELEINE enters. Upon first glance, it's less like a hospital
text: room than the apartment of a faded aristocrat. On the walls,
text: sketches of courtesans in erotic poses, culled from Justine
dialog: and Juliette. On the bookshelf, medical volumes: The History
dialog: of Madness, Lateau's Illustrated Anatomy, and Diseases of
text: the Bowel. In the corner, a foot-stool carved from human
text: bone. And--atop an ornate wooden desk, mottled with ink-stains--
text: an explosion of quills. But no sign of the MARQUIS.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Marquis? Where'd you get to, then?
text: Tentatively, MADELEINE proceeds toward the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT/BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A large canopied bed--its velvet drapes closed-- beckons to

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Well....?
text: MADELEINE whirls around to face the MARQUIS. He steps into a
dialog: halo of light. Given his years of incarceration, he's still
text: dressed in the finery of Louis XIV, though its become frayed
text: and off-color. His wig is immaculately coifed but thin with
dialog: age. Still, there's something sensual about him; perhaps
text: it's the odor of decadence, which lingers over him like
dialog: perfume.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Did I frighten you?
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: You? Frighten me? That's a good one!

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: I suppose you want to know about
dialog: that silly book of yours.
text: MADELEINE can't restrain herself any longer; she smiles, and
text: pulls a small bag--heavy with coins--from her apron pocket.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE (CONT'D)
dialog: It sold like the devil, 'fore they
dialog: started burning it.
text: She tosses the bag to THE MARQUIS, who catches it and grins:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: The peril of composing such incendiary
dialog: prose...
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: I put myself at life and limb. Surely
dialog: that's worth a few louis.
text: The MARQUIS rummages in the pouch for some money.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: If only these coins purchased your
dialog: other talents, too.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: There's something else I want from
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: You've already stolen my heart, as
dialog: well as another more prominent organ,
dialog: south of the Equator...
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Your publisher says I'm not to leave
dialog: without a new manuscript.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I've just the story...inspired by

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Is it awfully violent?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Most assuredly.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Is it terribly erotic?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Fiendishly so.
text: MADELEINE squeals with delight.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: But it comes with a price.
dialog: MADELEINE's face pales a bit. What might that be?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: A kiss for each page.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Must I administer them directly, or
dialog: might I blow them?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (cooing low in her
dialog: ear)
dialog: The price, my coquette, is every bit
dialog: as firm as I am...
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: (with a nervous giggle)
dialog: Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
text: She blows a wayward curl from her face, and leans in to kiss
text: THE MARQUIS. A quick peck. He passes her a single page.
text: She takes it, shuts her eyes, and puckers her lips again.
text: This time, THE MARQUIS traces her lower lip with his
text: forefinger. MADELEINE trembles, partly in fear, partly with

speaker_heading: COULMIER

scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT/BEDROOM - MEANWHILE
speaker_heading: AN EVER-GROWING PILE OF PAPERS

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: It's a long story, this one.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: The climax comes at a higher cost;

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: You demand a lot from your readers,
dialog: you do.
text: She gathers her skirts, and crawls into his lap. As she

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: The story's thrilling conclusion
dialog: comes at a premium.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: What's that then?

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (low and hypnotic:)
dialog: Your maidenhead. And then you must

text: MADELEINE wriggles out of his grasp, and SLAPS him, hard.
text: The MARQUIS is stunned, but impressed by her gumption.

dialog: Mademoiselle Leclerc.
text: COULMIER stands in the doorway, looking none too pleased.
text: Quickly, MADELEINE shoves the manuscript under her blouse.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: You're in the nick of time. This old
dialog: lech forgot himself. He thought I
dialog: was a character in one of his nasty

text: She heads out the door, clutching the manuscript against her

scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT/DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: COULMIER

speaker_heading: MADELEINE

speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: The next time you feel the urge to

text: Glug, glug, glug as the MARQUIS pours two glasses of wine.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a rare vintage from an obscure
dialog: village in Bordeaux. Rather than
dialog: crush the grape underfoot, they place
dialog: the fruit on the belly of a bride
dialog: and reap its juices when the young
text: husband steers his vessel into port.
text: He sniffs his glass rapturously, then passes one to COULMIER:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: A full-bodied flavor with just a
dialog: hint of wantonness? Bottom's up!
dialog: COULMIER takes the glass. THE MARQUIS watches; will he gag?
text: Will he spit it out? COULMIER sips. He swallows. Finally:
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: It's from our own cellar. I recognize
dialog: the taste.
dialog: THE MARQUIS' face falls.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I should've told you it was the blood

speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: We treat you well enough here, don't

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS

speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I'm not a beautiful young prospect,

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Don't be so sure.
text: COULMIER's amused in spite of himself. THE MARQUIS laughs,
text: too, only with a slightly sinister edge.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge
dialog: these wicked thoughts of yours on

dialog: chastises one LUNATIC who's chewing on his brush:
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Please don't eat the paint, Pascal.
text: Next, he steps forward to inspect a painting by DAUPHIN, a
text: cheery fellow with severe burns on much of his face. The
text: canvas depicts a grisly scene; a desperate father shepherds
text: his children out of a burning house, his robes ablaze.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Bravo, Dauphin. It's far better to

scene_heading: INT. CHARENTON - CHAPEL - MINUTES LATER

speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: It's a formality; truly.
speaker_heading: COULMIER

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Have you tried bleeding him with

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I write of the great, eternal truths
dialog: that bind together all mankind! The
dialog: whole world over, we eat, we shit,
dialog: we fuck, we kill and we die.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: But we also fall in love; we build
dialog: cities, we compose symphonies, and
dialog: we endure. Why not put that in your
dialog: books as well?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: But isn't that the duty of art? To
dialog: elevate us above the beast?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I thought that was your duty, Abbe,
dialog: not mine.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: One more trick like this, and I'll
dialog: be forced to revoke all your

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS

speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: (blurting the truth)
dialog: More than your writing's at stake.
dialog: The Ministry has threatened us with
dialog: closure.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: They can't be serious.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Our future lies in the stroke of
dialog: your pen.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (impressed, even
dialog: flattered)
dialog: Mightier than the sword indeed.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Put yourself in my place. I've your
dialog: fellow patients to consider. If
dialog: Charenton falls, they've no place to
dialog: go. No manner in which to clothe or
dialog: feed themselves--
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and
dialog: pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets,
dialog: as Nature intended.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: You among them?
text: This gives THE MARQUIS pause; COULMIER has a point.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: (his most passionate
dialog: plea yet)
dialog: If ever I showed you a kind hand,
dialog: Marquis....If ever I granted you
dialog: walking privileges on a Spring day,
dialog: or slipped an extra pillow beneath
dialog: your door...if ever I shared your
dialog: wine, laughed at your vulgarities,
dialog: or humored you with argument...then
dialog: you will oblige me now. For your
dialog: sake, and for all Charenton.

speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: (undaunted)
dialog: Do I have your word?
text: THE MARQUIS catches MADELEINE's reflection in his mirror.
dialog: In her face, the question: "What on earth are you going to
dialog: do?" He winks at her.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Have no fear, Abbe.
text: He turns back to COULMIER. He has the open, honest eyes of a
dialog: Spaniel, but his words are double-edged:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I swear; all that Charenton has given
dialog: me, I'll repay a hundred-fold.
text: MADELEINE's eyes grow wide with wonder at the prospect.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: If you only mean to dupe me again--
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (indignant now)
dialog: Honestly! You cut me to the core!
dialog: What's the point of all your valiant
dialog: attempts at rehabilitation if--when
dialog: I finally succumb--when at long last,
dialog: I pledge myself to righteous conduct--
dialog: you regard me with nothing but
dialog: suspicion? Have you no faith in
dialog: your own medicine?

speaker_heading: COULMIER

dialog: Thank-you.
scene_heading: INT. THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE MARQUIS' CELL - MEANWHILE

speaker_heading: COLLARD.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: My, my. At Charenton, even the walls

speaker_heading: to see the DOCTOR.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I spoke to him with reason and
dialog: compassion; the tools which serve us
dialog: best here.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: And---?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: He's sworn to obedience.
dialog: The DOCTOR--ever doubtful--mutters "tsk, tsk, tsk," and turns
dialog: to leave; COULMIER calls after him, insistent:
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: He's more than a patient, Doctor;
dialog: the Marquis is my friend--
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: You keep strange company, Abbe. But
dialog: if you truly have matters in hand
dialog: here--
speaker_heading: COULMIER

scene_heading: EXT. THE PANTHEMONT CONVENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: ROYER-COLLARD stands beneath the convent's trellis, and pounds

speaker_heading: SISTER NOIRCEUIL
dialog: We'd not expected you for some time.
dialog: Simone has not yet come of age.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: I've taken a new post at Charenton;
dialog: I need the succor only a wife can
dialog: provide.
text: They arrive at the room of the convent's ward, SIMONE.
scene_heading: INT. PANTHEMONT CONVENT - SIMONE'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS
text: They interrupt the GIRL in prayer before a porcelain figure
text: of the MADONNA; she rises. With her doe-like eyes and cherubic
dialog: skin, SIMONE could be the DOCTOR's daughter as readily as
dialog: his wife.
speaker_heading: SISTER NOIRCEUIL
dialog: You remember Dr. Royer-Collard.
text: SIMONE blushes, and casts her eyes downward.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I'd not forget the man to whom I was

speaker_heading: SISTER NOIRCEUIL
dialog: He's come to collect you.
speaker_heading: SIMONE

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE PANTHEMONT CONVENT - MINUTES LATER
text: SIMONE stands in her traveling cape, clutching her MADONNA,
text: ROYER-COLLARD beside her. A CLUSTER of NUNS has gathered to

text: SISTER ROSE FATIMA. The MOTHER SUPERIOR hands SIMONE a small
dialog: valise:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 35
speaker_heading: SISTER NOIRCEUIL
dialog: Be grateful, child. It's my experience
dialog: that most poor girls who are orphaned
dialog: never wed; They wind up spinsters,
dialog: or worse still... nuns.
text: She takes SIMONE by the chin; her fingers are talons.
speaker_heading: SISTER NOIRCEUIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank God that Fortune has spared
dialog: you from such a Fate.
text: SISTER NOIRCEUIL bows her head toward ROYER-COLLARD, giving
text: him permission to go. He extends his arm to SIMONE.
text: Hesitantly, she takes it. He guides her toward the waiting
text: carriage. SISTER NOIRCEUIL is grimly pleased. SISTER FLAVIE
text: and SISTER ROSE FATIMA exchange a look of grave concern.
speaker_heading: SISTER ROSE FATIMA
dialog: Good-bye, Simone.
speaker_heading: SISTER FLAVIE

scene_heading: INT. THE DOCTOR'S CARRIAGE
text: ROYER-COLLARD sits stiffly by his new bride; she stares out
text: the window. Looming on the horizon, a towering chateau.
text: SIMONE's eyes grow wide with wonder. TWO MEN stand outside,
dialog: waiting to greet them, with their own carriage and driver
dialog: standing by.
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ (O.S.)
dialog: The Emperor wishes to ensure your

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU - CONTINUOUS

dialog: The DOCTOR assesses his new home up-close; it's fallen into
text: grave disuse. Practically a ruin. Delbené gestures to MONSIEUR
text: PROUIX, a dimpled young fellow, nattily dressed.
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ (CONT'D)
dialog: Monsieur Prouix is the court's most
dialog: promising young architect; he's at
dialog: your disposal.
text: MONSIEUR PROUIX offers a friendly grin; the DOCTOR gives him
dialog: the cursory once-over.
scene_heading: INT. THE CHATEAU - ATRIUM
text: The THREE MEN enter, SIMONE a few paces behind. An opulent
dialog: space, fallen into desuetude: a marble floor with matching
text: columns, a domed ceiling, and an expansive staircase.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: (drily)
dialog: It has possibilities, yes. Simone?
text: SIMONE flinches, surprised the DOCTOR is addressing her so
text: publicly. She says in a voice hushed with awe:
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I'm to live here?
text: ROYER-COLLARD moves toward the stairs; something catches his
text: attention. Underfoot, a huge, crimson stain, rimmed in yellow.
text: The DOCTOR gets down on his haunches and runs a hands over
text: it. He glances up at Delbené, his face a question mark.
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: The place hasn't been occupied since
dialog: the Terror; it belonged to the Duc
dialog: de Blangis, an avowed monarchist.
dialog: The Jacobins were most... unforgiving.
text: Lying askance, a moldy old shoe with a cracked heel.
dialog: Delbené sidles up to ROYER-COLLARD and says confidentially:
speaker_heading: DELBENÉ (CONT'D)
dialog: His wife was trying to escape; they
dialog: caught her on the stair, and set
dialog: upon her with bayonets.

dialog: Royer-collard stands and turns to Prouix:
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: We'd best quarry fresh marble, don't
dialog: you think?
text: PROUIX dutifully makes a note.
scene_heading: INT. THE CHATEAU - UPPER ATRIUM
text: ROYER-COLLARD coaxes PROUIX aside for a confidential
dialog: conversation:
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: You're to humor my wife in all things.
dialog: If she wants Venetian glass, she's
dialog: to have it. Italian tile, Dutch
dialog: velvet; spare no expense.
dialog: (lowering his voice
dialog: to a whisper)
dialog: But in her bedchamber, see to it
dialog: that the door locks from the outside.
dialog: And on her windows....an iron grate.
speaker_heading: PROUIX
dialog: Bars, sir?
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: In the convent, Simone was spared
dialog: the world's temptations. I won't
dialog: have her falling prey to them now.
text: ROYER-COLLARD glances over the railing, down below; SIMONE
text: stands, overwhelmed, in the enormous atrium. Over her head,

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: She's a rare bird; I intend to keep

speaker_heading: SISTER ROSE FATIMA
dialog: It's a scandal, truly. Him, pretending
dialog: to be a God-fearing man!
speaker_heading: SISTER FLAVIE

speaker_heading: LOUISON and GUERIN exchange a grin.
speaker_heading: INT. LAUNDRY - LATER

speaker_heading: MICHETTE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: GUERIN

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: --he's old enough to have fathered

text: THE MARQUIS' eyes spark with inspiration.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Why, the hypocrite. It has all the

dialog: straightaway, and tell Franval to
dialog: cancel rehearsal...
scene_heading: CLOSE UP: A MAGNIFICENT WHITE QUILL PEN.
text: As he blithely hums "Claire de la Lune," THE MARQUIS dips
text: the quill into his ink well; the liquid shoots up the
text: feather's shaft, turning it a deep purple color.
dialog: On his PARCHMENT, in calligraphic script, the words "The
dialog: Crimes of Love: A Play in Several Lascivious Acts..."
text: THE MARQUIS' little tune rises all the way to symphonic tones,
dialog: and we fade up to...
scene_heading: EXT. CHARENTON TERRACE - EVENING
dialog: Tonight the place looks less like a madhouse and more like
dialog: the Comèdie Francaise. Mingling on the steps, bejeweled
text: DOWAGERS and GENTLEMEN in frock-coats. Flanking COULMIER,
scene_heading: two GRAND DAMES: MADAME BOUGIVAL and MADEMOISELLE CLAIRWIL,

dialog: (appraising the ABBE)
dialog: Mmm. Yes. I'm sure.
text: COULMIER notices ROYER-COLLARD mounting the steps with SIMONE.
text: In her finery, SIMONE looks less like a society bride, and
text: more like a child playing dress-up. COULMIER gives the DOCTOR
text: a cordial wave. ROYER-COLLARD nods, curtly.
speaker_heading: MADAME BOUGIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that the new Doctor? You must be

scene_heading: CLOSE UP: A PLACARD FOR "THE HAPPY SHOEMAKER"
text: A hand crumples it; tears it up.
speaker_heading: FRAME WIDENS
dialog: and we see it's THE MARQUIS. He's in the linen pantry, which
dialog: has been jerry-rigged as a BACKSTAGE AREA for the evening's
dialog: Little Theater Performance, which will take place in the
dialog: laundry. Poised near him, the Stage Manager for the evening,
dialog: MADELEINE. They exchange a conspiratorial glance; tonight's

dialog: I hope he'll remember forever...
text: The CAST gives a rallying cry; THE MARQUIS turns and peers
dialog: out the tattered velvet curtains.
speaker_heading: MARQUIS' POV:
dialog: The catacombs have been converted into a make-shift theater-
dialog: in-the-round. The place has a slightly sinister feel; one of
text: Dante's lower circles. A primitive platform stage has been
text: erected in the spot customarily held by MADAME LECLERC's
dialog: vat.
text: The SOCIETY FOLK sit on benches alongside the FEEBLE and the
text: DAMNED. THE LUNATIC QUARTET plays its bizarre instruments:
text: 18th century curled horns, and home-made strings. A grinning
text: DAUPHIN lights the torches that will illuminate the stage.
text: From the AUDIENCE, excited twitters.
dialog: A grand night for slumming among the loons! A bacchanal!
text: He sees RENEE PELAGIE take her seat, and lower her hood,
text: craning her neck for a sight of the man she loves. Next, he
text: marks ROYER-COLLARD, sitting on a newly-erected dais next.to
text: his lovely wife SIMONE. COULMIER sits at the DOCTOR's

speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil--
dialog: and of course--the Marquis' wife--
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: (evincing interest)
dialog: Oh indeed?
text: Meanwhile--backstage--FRANVAL nervously taps the MARQUIS on
dialog: the shoulder:
speaker_heading: FRANVAL
dialog: Begging your pardon; it's time to
dialog: begin.
dialog: THE MARQUIS drops the curtain, and reminds FRANVAL:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: The dedication, word for word; it's
dialog: every bit as crucial as the play
dialog: which follows--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: FRANVAL
dialog: (his voice quavering)
dialog: Madames and Messieurs, there's been
dialog: a change in tonight's program.
text: ANGLE ON: COULMIER, who stiffens with apprehension.
dialog: This is an unexpected development.
speaker_heading: FRANVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: We will not be performing The Happy
dialog: Shoemaker.
text: From the AUDIENCE, stirs and murmurs. Perhaps a few
text: disappointed sighs. From the wings, THE MARQUIS gestures for
text: FRANVAL to take a few significant steps forward, toward THE
speaker_heading: DOCTOR.
speaker_heading: FRANVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Instead, we'd like to premiere a new
dialog: play in honor of the newly-appointed
dialog: Dr. Royer-Collard and his lovely
dialog: bride, married nary a week today--
scene_heading: ANGLE ON: ROYER-COLLARD AND HIS WIFE.

dialog: polite smattering of applause.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: FRANVAL
speaker_heading: FRANVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: --a comedy entitled...
dialog: He dries up. From backstage, THE MARQUIS hisses:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: The Crimes of Love!
speaker_heading: FRANVAL
dialog: ...The Crimes of Love, written by
dialog: one of Charenton's very own wards!
text: FRANVAL glances back at THE MARQUIS. THE AUDIENCE follows
dialog: suit. The moment they see SADE, they break into even louder
dialog: applause than they gave ROYER-COLLARD. The asylum's most
dialog: notorious inmate! Right here, before their very eyes!
text: In a show of false modesty, THE MARQUIS blushes, steps out
text: from behind the curtain, and gives a cursory little bow.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 43
text: ROYER-COLLARD glances back at COULMIER as if to say "What's
dialog: this?" COULMIER starts fingering his rosary in nervous
text: anticipation. RENEE PELAGIE just closes her eyes.
text: ANGLE ON: THE STAGE AS THE BAND PLAYS
text: A LUNATIC dressed as an ANGEL sits high atop one ladder, and
text: a DEVIL on another. Together, the TWO start pummeling the
text: stage with artificial snow. BOUCHON stands in the wings,
text: heaving a giant set of bellows, creating the North Wind.
text: INT. BACKSTAGE.
text: MADELEINE rushes to ready the cast; DAUPHIN is dressed as a
text: MOTHER SUPERIOR; he looks markedly like Sister Noirceuil of
text: the Panthemont Convent. Behind him, PITOU is the FEMALE
text: INGENUE; a veritable Simone. He cries out for his bonnet:
speaker_heading: PITOU
dialog: My hat, my hat!
text: MADELEINE affixes his hat, hands PITOU and DAUPHIN each a
text: hobby horse, and pushes them toward the STAGE.
speaker_heading: ANGLE: ONSTAGE

text: linen pantry onto the wooden stage.
speaker_heading: INGENUE
dialog: Oh Sister Saint-Fond, whither do we
dialog: go? Passing o'er rivers, canyons
dialog: and snow?
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR
dialog: Hurry, Eugenie, for we must not tarry;
dialog: I deliver you now to the man you
dialog: shall marry!
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: SIMONE
text: Her girlish face alive with pleasure, charmed by the spectacle
dialog: before her.
speaker_heading: MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Once you have rested, at your leisure--
dialog: he'll coach you in the ways of
dialog: pleasure.
text: A RIPPLE through the AUDIENCE; tonight's performance is

dialog: BOUCHON collects their hobby horses.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 44
text: TWO LUNATICS enter, covered in ornate vines. They form an
text: ARCHWAY. With a drum roll and a thunder-clap, CLEANTE rises
text: from the AUDIENCE--just a few seats away from ROYER-COLLARD--
text: and hops onstage to assume the role of THE LIBERTINE. GASPS
text: of SURPRISE from the crowd. He wears a coat and hat that
speaker_heading: match the DOCTOR's.
speaker_heading: PITOU and DAUPHIN re-enter from the wings.
speaker_heading: LIBERTINE
dialog: At last she arrives, my hard-won
dialog: bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry
dialog: inside. There you'll find such
dialog: treasures await you; Marzipan and
dialog: meringue to sate you!
speaker_heading: INGENUE
dialog: Such gallantry in men is--sadly--a
dialog: rarity; How lucky I am to receive
dialog: his charity!
text: The INGENUE ducks through the HUMAN ARCHWAY into the imagined
text: CHATEAU. The LIBERTINE passes the MOTHER SUPERIOR a comically
dialog: large purse.
speaker_heading: LIBERTINE
dialog: Thank you, dear Sister, for abetting
dialog: me so; Bringing her here to this
dialog: secluded Chateau! Little does she
dialog: know the terrors in store; when I
dialog: tutor her in--
dialog: He leans into ROYER-COLLARD for this last bit:
speaker_heading: LIBERTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...les crimes de l'amour!
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: ROYER-COLLARD.
text: He glances all the way past the play, through the AUDIENCE
text: seated in the opposite bank.
text: There--looming in the back row against the wall--THE MARQUIS,
text: who grins; the poison arrow has hit his mark. The DOCTOR--
text: ever composed, grins back. An even-handed challenge that
dialog: says "I know what you're up to; you're only dooming yourself."
text: Slyly, THE MARQUIS slips behind a column, disappearing from
dialog: view.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD whispers to SIMONE:
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD

speaker_heading: SIMONE

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: THE DOOR
text: As SIMONE and GAILLON slip toward the exit, THE MARQUIS stands
text: waiting for them. He casts a knowing glance at SIMONE, then
speaker_heading: wisecracks to GAILLON:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Leaving so soon? Oh, but of course!
dialog: You've seen it before.

speaker_heading: ANGLE: ONSTAGE
text: The play continues, full-throttle: BOUCHON pushes a bed
text: onstage. The INGENUE cowers on the mattress; the LIBERTINE
dialog: leaps upon her.
speaker_heading: LIBERTINE
dialog: Quickly, my suckling, out of your
dialog: clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid
dialog: it grows!
speaker_heading: INGENUE
dialog: Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say!
dialog: You're not my lover; you're a
dialog: monstrous rouè!
text: The LIBERTINE yanks up the INGENUE's legs and dives beneath
text: her skirts. From beneath the fabric, a host of VULGAR SOUNDS.
speaker_heading: LIBERTINE
dialog: Do as I say! Stick your legs in the
dialog: air! It's true, I'm a pig and you've
dialog: truffles down there--
text: This is all COULMIER can bear; he rises from his seat, in
text: pursuit of THE MARQUIS. He aims for the door, but THE MARQUIS
text: has already disappeared. COULMIER starts scanning the crowd,
text: hoping to find him in the sea of faces.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: RENEE PELAGIE
text: She turns, aware of her husband's presence somewhere behind
text: her. MADAME BOUGIVAL says loudly to MADEMOISELLE CLAIRWIL:

dialog: p. 46
speaker_heading: MADAME BOUGIVAL
dialog: Who do you suppose is to blame? The
dialog: author...or his Muse?
text: RENEE's face falls, stricken. MADAME BOUGIVAL and MADEMOISELLE
text: CLAIRWIL titter behind their fans.
speaker_heading: ANGLE: ONSTAGE
dialog: THE LIBERTINE continues to pleasure THE INGENUE with his
dialog: mouth:
speaker_heading: INGENUE
dialog: (her tone changing)
dialog: Good heavens, what's this? Such a
dialog: wicked sensation! A feeling somewhere
dialog: between shame and elation! Yes!
dialog: That's the way; use your tongue like
dialog: a wand in much the same manner as
dialog: Sister Saint-Fond!
speaker_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE
text: MADELEINE scurries about, readying the LUNATIC CAST for the
scene_heading: Second Act: A FAUX NAPOLEON, A MALE NUN, FRANVAL, DAUPHIN
text: and a LOON DRESSED AS JESUS CHRIST.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Quickly; the second act!
text: They exit onto the stage. MADELEINE is alone now backstage.
text: Or so it seems, until BOUCHON looms up behind her in the
dialog: darkness.
speaker_heading: BOUCHON'S POV: MADELEINE
text: peering through the curtains at the performance. He admires
text: the nape of her neck; her soft shoulders. Meanwhile--onstage--
dialog: the play moves apace:
speaker_heading: THE LIBERTINE
dialog: I had a suspicion the Sister was
dialog: Sapphic!
speaker_heading: THE INGENUE
dialog: I'd tell you more, but it's simply
dialog: too graphic. Suffice it to say, she's
dialog: a preference for lasses! Even at
dialog: Vespers, she always made passes---
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 47
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: MADELEINE
text: Suddenly, BOUCHON's hands appears around the base of her
text: neck; his finger flicker across her cheek. Her face fills
text: with shock, and she disappears behind the curtain.
speaker_heading: LIBERTINE
dialog: My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel!
dialog: Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
speaker_heading: INGENUE
dialog: Was ever a man more risquè? He wants
dialog: to take me every way!
speaker_heading: ANGLE: BACKSTAGE
text: BOUCHON yanks MADELEINE behind a curtain, and pushes her--
text: hard--against a stone wall. With a visceral grunt, he gropes
text: her beneath her petticoat. She gives a sharp yelp, and reaches
text: for an iron, still red-hot from the day's work.
text: She presses it--hard--against BOUCHON's cheek. His flesh
dialog: sizzles.
speaker_heading: BOUCHON
dialog: Ahhhhhggggg....
speaker_heading: ANGLE: ONSTAGE
dialog: The obscene pantomime gets wilder by the minute:
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: THE AUDIENCE
text: COULMIER hears BOUCHON's tortured cry, and lurches from the
text: dais, marching directly across the stage. VALCOUR leaps up
text: from his own aisle seat, and follows the PRIEST. The
dialog: rollicking play continues onstage:
speaker_heading: LIBERTINE
dialog: I'll plunder every lovely pore until
dialog: you're weak and cry "no more!"
speaker_heading: INGENUE
dialog: I tremble with fear! You're bound to
dialog: pound the quivering lips of my Venus
dialog: mound!
speaker_heading: LIBERTINE
dialog: And then--to prove your truly mine--
dialog: I'll plunder you, darling, from
dialog: behind!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 48
speaker_heading: INGENUE
dialog: What of my lips, will you soil them
dialog: too? When you've broken every other
dialog: taboo?
speaker_heading: LIBERTINE
dialog: I'll fill every slippery hollow; if
dialog: you're obliging, then you'll swallow!
text: COULMIER rips aside the backstage curtain, revealing MADELEINE--
text: still out of breath--and BOUCHON, grabbing his face in pain.
text: The AUDIENCE--giddy and oblivious--starts to peal with
dialog: pleasure; they're certainly getting their money's worth
dialog: tonight!
speaker_heading: VALCOUR seizes BOUCHON roughly.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Take him to the infirmary for a
dialog: plaster, and an ice bath. That'll
dialog: cool him.
text: VALCOUR drags a quivering BOUCHON away.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Has he hurt you?
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: (bravely)
dialog: His stinking breath caused my eyes
dialog: to run, that's all.
text: COULMIER kisses her on the forehead. She clutches him in a
text: hug, and dissolves into tears. COULMIER looks up to see THE
text: MARQUIS standing nearby. The TWO MEN lock eyes for an
text: instant; a flicker of jealousy passes between them.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: You mean to take us all down with
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (with mock innocence)
dialog: Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
text: COULMIER glances past THE MARQUIS to see ROYER-COLLARD rise
text: from his seat, and--imperiously--gather his hat and coat.
text: Their eyes meet for an instant; ROYER-COLLARD shoots daggers.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the audience now,
dialog: expansively)
dialog: It's only a play!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 49
dialog: The AUDIENCE is on its feet now; some cry "Bravo!" Others
text: hurl insults at the stage. Frantic, FRANVAL gestures to the
dialog: STAGE HANDS to bring the curtain down.
scene_heading: EXT. CHARENTON - TERRACE - MINUTES LATER.
text: The DOCTOR flings open the door of his carriage, where SIMONE
dialog: waits for him.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: It was fiction, of course.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: (brusquely)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: It was not inspired by circumstance.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: No. It most certainly was not.
dialog: He boards, slamming the door shut with finality:
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You ought to be ashamed, Abbe.
dialog: Exploiting those drooling, pathetic
dialog: cretins for financial gain--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: That's not our intent--
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: --a veritable freak show for tourists
dialog: and curiosity seekers. Charenton is
dialog: a sanatorium; she is not a circus.
dialog: The theater is henceforth closed. As
dialog: for your avowed friend--playwright
dialog: emeritus of the madhouse--
dialog: COULMIER swallows; he knows what's coming.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I'll do everything in my power--
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: (cutting him off
dialog: abruptly)
dialog: Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced
dialog: to report to the Ministry that the
dialog: inmates are indeed running the asylum.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 50
text: The carriage screeches away, leaving Coulmier alone in the
dialog: night air.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT - SHORTLY THEREAFTER
text: COULMIER bursts into the MARQUIS's quarters to find him
text: enjoying a late-night snack of fricandeau, a napkin tied
dialog: around his neck.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I hope you're satisfied; he's shut
dialog: down the theater.
text: THE MARQUIS plucks the napkin from around his neck, and tosses
text: it haughtily onto his plate.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: He can't do that to me.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: How can one man possibly be so
dialog: selfish?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: We held a mirror up to the Doctor,
dialog: and--apparently--he didn't like what
dialog: he saw.
text: COULMIER charges to THE MARQUIS' desk and plucks a hand-full
text: of quills from the ink stand.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (dropping his fork)
dialog: What the devil--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: If you won't be true to your word,
dialog: then you've left me no choice.
text: COULMIER grabs quills off the window-sill, the side-board
dialog: and the secretary. THE MARQUIS realizes COULMIER means
text: business; he lunges for the ink stand. It spills, sending
dialog: ink all over his desk.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: But I kept my promise! I didn't
dialog: publish--
dialog: COULMIER shoots a glare that says "Oh, please."
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 51
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Perhaps--in time--you'll earn them
dialog: back through good behavior--
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: You can't--! You mustn't--! I've all
dialog: the demons of hell in my head; my
dialog: only salvation is to vent them on
dialog: paper--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Try reading, for a change. The writer
dialog: who produces more than he reads? The
dialog: sure mark of an amateur.
text: He snares a Bible off the shelf, tossing it to THE MARQUIS.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Start with the Bible; it's cheerier,
dialog: and more artfully written.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (spitting on its cover)
dialog: That monstrous God of yours? He strung
dialog: up his very own son like a side of
dialog: veal; I shudder to think what He'd
dialog: do to me.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: You know what sacrilege is, don't
dialog: you? The last refuge of the failed
dialog: provocateur.
text: COULMIER yanks open the desk drawer. In it, bottles of ink.
text: He starts to fill his pockets.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (truly frightened now)
dialog: I'll die of loneliness! I've no
dialog: company but the characters I create--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Whores and pederasts? You're better
dialog: off without them.
text: The MARQUIS abruptly switches gears; he has a new idea.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I have a proposition.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: You always do.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 52
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Madeleine. She's besotted with me;
dialog: she'd do anything I ask. She could
dialog: pay you a midnight visit--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I don't know who you insult more;
dialog: her or me.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: "Part the gates of heaven," as it
dialog: were--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: That's enough.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: You're tense, darling. You could use
dialog: a long, slow screw.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Good day, Marquis.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
speaker_heading: THEN BUGGER ME!
text: COULMIER exits, locking the door behind him.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: GOD DAMN YOU, ABBE! HAVE YOU NO TRUE
dialog: SENSE OF MY CONDITION? OF ITS GRAVITY?
dialog: My writing is involuntary, like the
dialog: beating of my heart! My constant
dialog: erection! I can't help it!
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: From inside his cell, the MARQUIS pounds on the door.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
speaker_heading: MAGGOT!
text: COULMIER pauses. He hears the sliding of the peep-hole in
text: the door. He turns back to see the MARQUIS staring at him
dialog: through the tiny slit.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Where there's a will, there's a way.
dialog: And a maniac is matchless for
dialog: invention.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 53
text: The peephole slams shut.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT - SOMETIME LATER
dialog: VALCOUR admits the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN from the theater, THE
text: MARQUIS' WIFE, RENEE PELAGIE. The MARQUIS stares out his
dialog: cell window without acknowledging her.
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: I've done just as you bade me; I've
dialog: paid a visit to the woodcarver. He
dialog: laughed and called me a whore, but
dialog: took my money just the same.
text: She sets a satchel down on his desk, and unwraps it.
text: Inside, two wooden prods, each about nine inches long. One
dialog: is ebony; the other rosewood.
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what brings you more
dialog: pleasure; the objects themselves, or
dialog: the humiliation I endure procuring
dialog: them on your behalf.
text: Next, she proffers a small box tied with a gold bow:
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: And--last but not least--I've brought
dialog: you aniseed drops and some chocolate
dialog: pastilles.
text: This gets his attention; he turns.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Did you now, Madame?
text: His face softens, and he says with a suggestive lilt:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: They're filled with cream, yes? You
dialog: know I shan't touch them, unless
dialog: they're positively bursting--erupting--
dialog: with cream.
text: RENEE PELAGIE blushes happily, delighted that she's pleased
text: him. THE MARQUIS crosses to her; en route, he notices
text: VALCOUR, spying through the peephole. He snaps it shut.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 54
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What else have you brought that I
dialog: might nibble upon?
text: He presses her against the wall, cupping her breast, and
text: kissing the tip of her nose. She offers faint protest:
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: Oh, Donatien...you mustn't..
text: He licks the rim of her ear as he whispers:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: (helpless with giggles)
dialog: ....shame on you, truly...
text: Suddenly--savagely--he slaps her; she reels, stunned.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm
dialog: to sit here, gorging myself on useless
dialog: trifles, sucking down your little
dialog: sweetmeats, when what I truly need--
dialog: what I truly require--are a few quill
dialog: pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: Forgive me, I beg you---
text: He pulls the drawers from his desk, and hurls them to the
dialog: ground; they splinter.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Don't you see? I've been raped! Far
dialog: more egregiously than any of my
dialog: wretched characters---
text: RENEE PELAGIE breaks away from him, and says in a voice
dialog: cracked with emotion:
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: How was I to know, my darling?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: How was I to tell you? By writing a
dialog: letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
text: RENEE PELAGIE backs herself into a corner, a safe distance
dialog: from her husband, and implores:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 55
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: I beg you, Donatien...as your
dialog: wife...your only ally...you must
dialog: stop making such a monstrous spectacle
dialog: of yourself.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: You've come to lecture me?
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: To flaunt your deviance in public?
dialog: Upon a stage?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: They've put you up to this, haven't
dialog: they?
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: You ought to court the Doctor's favor,
dialog: not his contempt.
text: THE MARQUIS tears open the box of candy, and pops one into
dialog: his mouth. He chews:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I ought to carve my name into his
dialog: backside, and fill the wounds with
dialog: salt--
text: RENEE PELAGIE's eyes well; she dabs them with a handkerchief.
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: You're here--safe--surrounded by
dialog: brick and mortar; but my prison is
dialog: far crueler. It has no walls.
text: She starts speaking in a mad rush, tripping over her own
text: words, frantic to spill it all out before he cuts her off:
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Everywhere I go, they point and
dialog: whisper! At the opera, they hiss at
dialog: me when I take my box. When I went
dialog: to church...the priest refused to
dialog: even hear my confession; he said I
dialog: was already damned! Why must I suffer
dialog: for your sins?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: It's the way of all martyrs, isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 56
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: Give me back my anonymity, that's
dialog: all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
text: THE MARQUIS explodes now, his eyes spinning with rage.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Tell me; have you done anything to
dialog: secure my release? NO! Have you
dialog: petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought
dialog: audience with the Emperor--
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: He refuses to be seen in my company!
dialog: He blanches at the mention of your
dialog: name--
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: It's a convenience, isn't it, having
dialog: your husband locked away! You no
dialog: longer have to hold your tongue, or
dialog: hoist your skirts! Or crack your
dialog: mouth, so I can put it to its one
dialog: pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE,
dialog: NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS,
dialog: AREN'T YOU?
text: RENEE PELAGIE starts to sob, convulsively. VALCOUR--hearing
dialog: the commotion--re-enters the cell.
speaker_heading: VALCOUR
dialog: What in the name a' God--
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Take this cow away; I can't look at
dialog: her.
text: VALCOUR escorts a fragile RENEE PELAGIE from the room.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps you'll find a place for her
dialog: in the West Wing, eh? AMONG THE
speaker_heading: HYSTERICS?
text: As they lumber out, THE MARQUIS bellows after them:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: LOCK HER UP AS WELL, SO SHE KNOWS
dialog: HOW IT FEELS! THE GORGON! THE SOW!

scene_heading: INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S CHATEAU - SHORTLY THEREAFTER
text: In the rear of her carriage, RENEE PELAGIE. She's dried her
text: tears, and now bears a look of fierce resolve: a woman imbued
dialog: with a mission.
scene_heading: INT. CHATEAU - THE ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: CRAFTSMEN buzz about the place like flies, carrying gilded
text: mirrors, uncrating sculpture, fitting wall sconces, etc.
text: GAILLON stands by at the door. ROYER-COLLARD AND MONSIEUR
text: PROUIX are at one end of the room, in rapt consultation.
text: Swatches, marble samples, and blueprints litter their table.
speaker_heading: MONSIEUR PROUIX
dialog: For a woman of humble origin, your
dialog: wife certainly has refined tastes!
dialog: When I suggest granite for the foyer,
dialog: she's quick to counter with Peruvian
dialog: marble. Peruvian marble! It costs a
dialog: fortune to import!
text: SIMONE wafts past on the balcony above; she glances down at
text: them, smiles. ROYER-COLLARD assumes the smile is meant for
text: him; he offers a tiny wave.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: Whatever her heart desires, Monsieur
dialog: Prouix.
text: MONSIEUR PROUIX assumes the smile is his; he offer his own
dialog: toothsome grin.
speaker_heading: MONSIEUR PROUIX
dialog: I'd like nothing better, sir, than
dialog: to grant her every wish.
dialog: (sotto voce, to the
speaker_heading: DOCTOR)
dialog: But on the modest sum you've accorded
dialog: me--I'm an architect, not a magician--
dialog: RENEE PELAGIE brushes past GAILLON with gale force:
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: I must see the Doctor at once. It's
dialog: a matter of dire urgency...
text: ROYER-COLLARD spies her instantly; their eyes lock.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 58
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: It is customary to write first, and
dialog: request an appointment--
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: Desperation has driven me past
dialog: etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: My schedule is not subject to the
dialog: whims of lunatics.
text: RENEE PELAGIE removes her hat, indicating her intention to
dialog: stay.
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in
dialog: a madhouse. Your every waking moment
dialog: is governed by the insane.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: (with a sigh)
dialog: I pray you: be succinct.
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps
dialog: you're not yet familiar with my
dialog: husband, and his unusual case.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: With all due respect, Madame, all
dialog: France is familiar with your husband.
speaker_heading: (to MONSIEUR PROUIX)
dialog: Grant us a moment alone, won't you,
dialog: Monsieur Prouix?
speaker_heading: MONSIEUR PROUIX
dialog: Happily, sir. Your servant, sir.
text: He gestures for the CRAFTSMEN to follow him out. The room--
text: a veritable hive of activity--is now silent. DR. ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: offers RENEE PELAGIE a seat.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Madame, please.
speaker_heading: RENEE sits.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 59
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest
dialog: hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed
dialog: forever, and that when at last he
dialog: perishes in the dank bowels of your
dialog: institution, he be left as carrion
dialog: for the rodents and the worms.
dialog: The DOCTOR's somewhat taken aback:
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: I stand corrected, Madame.
dialog: Now that she's alone in the DOCTOR's company, the full force
dialog: of RENEE PELAGIE's despair issues forth:
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: If you can't cure him--truly cure
dialog: him-- then--at least--I beg you--
dialog: harness the beast that rages in his
dialog: soul.
text: The wheels in ROYER-COLLARD'S brain begin to turn; he idly
dialog: fingers a swatch of fabric.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: It's not so easily done, Madame.
text: He rises, circling RENEE PELAGIE.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: You're aware, are you not, that it
dialog: costs a great deal to house your
dialog: husband at Charenton...
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: I pay his stipend every month, far
dialog: more dutifully than I should.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: That barely covers the cost of his
dialog: room. There's nary a penny left over
dialog: for appropriate treatments. Opiates
dialog: to quell his temper. Restraints to
dialog: chasten him when he misbehaves.
dialog: RENEE PELAGIE can sense the direction of the conversation;
text: she blushes, and stares at her hands in her lap.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps if you were to buttress your
dialog: entreaties with the means to oblige
dialog: them...

speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: But you've a pension, haven't you,
dialog: from the sale of his books?
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: It's tainted money, Doctor.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: What thought is that?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: That ill-gotten funds, borne of his
dialog: degeneracy, might now effect his
dialog: salvation.
dialog: RENEE ponders the thought; it has a certain righteous
dialog: symmetry.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: If you're truly determined to step
dialog: out of the shadow of your husband's
dialog: celebrity--
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: Oh, but I am!
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: --words alone are insufficient.
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: It's beyond perversity. That honor

dialog: The DOCTOR rises and crosses to her:
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Imagine; old friends once again
dialog: deigning to kiss your hand.
dialog: (kissing her hand,

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Now is the time to secure your
dialog: epitaph: The benevolent Marquise,

speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: I am eternally in your debt.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD

scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' BEDROOM - MEANWHILE.
text: THE MARQUIS lies against his pillow, his eyes flickering
text: malevolently in the candlelight. He hears the tinkling of
text: dinner china outside his door.
scene_heading: INT. A CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: MADELEINE carries a dinner tray for THE MARQUIS. She reaches
text: his cell. He slides open his peep-hole. His voice has the
dialog: desperate rasp of a man in withdrawal:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Madeleine, my sweet...can you smuggle
dialog: a paper and quill to me?
text: MADELEINE shoves the tray under his door; she glances down
text: the hall to see VALCOUR stationed there.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: I don't dare. The Doctor's got his
dialog: eye on you, sharper than ever now.
text: She gives him an apologetic look, and ambles on her way.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT/DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The MARQUIS plops his tray down on his desk. Wine from the
text: carafe sloshes out; a few drops land on his napkin. He stares
text: at the pattern of the burgundy drops against the white of
text: the linen. He traces a finger along the splotch.
text: His face lights up; an idea. He grabs the carafe in one hand.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: He steps into the room. In front of him, his bed. The sheets
dialog: are stretched against it immaculately: not so much as a
text: wrinkle. Inch after inch of white; a beautiful blank page.
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP: A ROAST CHICKEN
text: The MARQUIS rips into the meat with his hands; he ferrets
text: out a bone. Next, he takes a tiny carving knife, and whittles
text: away at it, sharpening its point and hollowing its marrow.
text: Voila. A make-shift quill. He dips it into the carafe. Next,
text: he tries a few strokes on the pillow-case over his desk. It
text: makes a clean, bold line. His eyes fill with grateful tears,
text: and he hugs himself in the night air.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CHARENTON ASYLUM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S CHATEAU - THE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: An enormous table separates ROYER-COLLARD from SIMONE.

text: SIMONE reads from a thin book. ROYER-COLLARD has had more
dialog: than his share from the carafe of wine; he's feeling
dialog: "expansive" tonight.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: We've ceiling beams en route from

dialog: Very much.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD

speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: I'd rather read, thank-you.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Good evening, then. I hope you enjoy

scene_heading: INT. CHATEAU - BEDROOM - A SHORT WHILE LATER
text: The canopy around the bed is closed. Behind it, a comely

scene_heading: NEW ANGLE: INSIDE THE CANOPIED BED - CONTINUOUS
text: Dressed only in a night-shift, SIMONE holds a book in one
text: hand and a candle in the other. She hears footsteps; the
text: door opens. SIMONE blows out her candle. Through the curtain,
text: she sees the looming shadow of her husband, carrying a taper
text: of his own. ROYER-COLLARD parts the drapes.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: I apologize if I took a severe tone.
text: He plucks the book from her hands, and regards its title for
text: a moment: A Lady's Garden of Verse. He smiles, bemused.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't be blamed for your naivetè,
dialog: not when it's chief among your charms.
text: He climbs into bed next to her; she rolls on her side, facing
text: away from him. He presses himself hard against her back and
dialog: whispers hoarsely in her ear:
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps the Sisters failed to instruct
dialog: you in the ways of marriage; the
dialog: nightly duty of a wife to her husband.
text: He takes the hem of her night-shift in hand, and with a
text: wrenching rrrriiiippp starts to tear it up the rear.
dialog: SIMONE--terrified at what's to come--seeks solace from the
dialog: room's only comfort: the porcelain MADONNA from the Panthemont
text: Convent sitting on her nightstand. The VIRGIN exudes a holy
text: light that illuminates SIMONE, even as she's violated by her

speaker_heading: MADELEINE (V.O.)
dialog: Your linens!

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: MADELEINE pounds again, glancing nervously at the ever-present
speaker_heading: VALCOUR.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Now or never!
text: The trap opens, and sheets pour out. MADELEINE gathers them,
text: and notices something odd. Her face lights up with amazement.
text: She unfurls the top sheet. It's covered in script. She stuffs
text: it down in her basket, and scurries past VALCOUR.
scene_heading: INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM - THAT NIGHT
text: MADELEINE sits by the fire. She unfolds THE MARQUIS' bedsheet
dialog: with loving care; like his pillowcase, its covered in words.
text: She starts to transcribe it. MADAME LECLERC sits near-by in
text: her rocking chair, knitting, her hands nimble in spite of
text: her blindness. She hears the "scratch, scratch" of a quill
dialog: tip across parchment.
speaker_heading: MADAME LECLERC
dialog: If you won't read it to your own
dialog: Mama, then perhaps you ought not to
dialog: be reading it at all.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
speaker_heading: MADAME LECLERC
dialog: Come now, darling, give it a read.
text: She clears her throat, and begins to read:
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: "Monsieur Bouloir was a man whose
dialog: erotic tastes might discreetly be
dialog: described as 'post-mortem.'"
text: MADAME LECLERC can't help it; she smiles a naughty smile.

scene_heading: INT. THE LAUNDRY - SHORTLY THEREAFTER
text: MADAME LECLERC sinks the scribbled sheets into a steaming

text: stick. The water turns red.
scene_heading: EXT. CHARENTON - COURTYARD - LATER
text: CHARLOTTE and MICHETTE are pulling the sodden sheets from
dialog: their baskets in order to hang them. They exchange a look;
text: something's askance. The sheets have an odd crimson hue.
dialog: "Off-color" indeed.
scene_heading: INT. THE LAUNDRY ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Steam rises thick as soup from the laundry vats. With a
text: flourish, ROYER-COLLARD unrolls a ruddy bedsheet for
text: MADELEINE's inspection. COULMIER stands by. MADAME LECLERC
text: creaks back and forth in her chair, anxiously.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Your mother may be blind as a bat,
dialog: but you've a keen pair of eyes,
dialog: haven't you?

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD

speaker_heading: COULMIER

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Perhaps your kettles are stained
dialog: with rust. Maybe the lye's turned
dialog: rancid. Or maybe...just maybe...
text: He plucks a candle from the wall sconce, and holds it behind
text: the sheet; bleeding through the fabric, traces of cursive.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: ...these sheets once belonged to our
dialog: friend, The Marquis.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: We've over two hundred beds. They

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Such a fine thread-count? Decorated

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
text: She's lying. It shows in her face.

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE THE MARQUIS' CELL
text: Stacked in the hallway, THE MARQUIS' furnishings; his chaise

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: So! The Doctor cracks the whip, and
dialog: you dance!
text: He gestures toward the barren space in the center of the

speaker_heading: COULMIER
speaker_heading: (gesturing to GUERIN)

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS

speaker_heading: COULMIER

speaker_heading: VALCOUR and LOUISON cart out the

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: And we mustn't forget Mary, sweet

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
speaker_heading: WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Because your writing continues,

speaker_heading: I ONLY RECORD IT!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: COULMIER

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Morbid gratification? NO! I write
dialog: what I've seen; the endless procession
dialog: to the chopping block. We're all
dialog: lined up at the guillotine, waiting

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Suppose you only put it in her mouth---
text: Suddenly, COULMIER lunges at the MARQUIS, pinning him to the
text: wall by his neck. VALCOUR, ORVOLLE, GUERIN and LOUISON all
text: freeze, ready to pounce. PITOU and DAUPHIN have emerged from
text: their cells, curious about the clammer. CLEANTE watches from
dialog: his peephole.

speaker_heading: FADE TO:
speaker_heading: C.U. THE MARQUIS' REFLECTION
text: Suddenly, it shatters, splintering like ice. THE MARQUIS has
text: slammed his own fist into a lone mirror. He picks up a shard
text: of glass and braces himself. With a grimace, he slashes his
text: finger. He winces, a sound lodged somewhere between pleasure
text: and pain. Next, he holds his finger over the ink well, and
text: squeezes. Blood starts to dribble--one drop at a time--into
dialog: the tiny bottle.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT: THE CHARENTON ASYLUM - MORNING

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: What have they done to you now?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Tortures so arcane, so medieval,
dialog: even I haven't the words to describe

scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: THE MARQUIS stands before MADELEINE, looking absolutely

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: My newest book begins at my right
dialog: cuff, continues across my back, and

dialog: Maybe "nipple." MADELEINE can't help it; she blurts a giggle.
text: THE MARQUIS joins her. Soon, they're both helpless with

dialog: goes silent.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Take your leave, quickly, so you
dialog: won't be blamed for my misbehavior.

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: A man after my own heart...
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: What in God's name am I to do with
dialog: you? The more I forbid, the more
dialog: you're provoked!
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I could be convinced to abandon my
dialog: writing, quite voluntarily.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: What on earth would that require?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: A night spent with the partner of my
dialog: choice.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
text: The MARQUIS blows a kiss in COULMIER's direction; COULMIER
dialog: turns a fiery red.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS

speaker_heading: I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex
dialog: without flirtation is merely rape!
speaker_heading: COULMIER
speaker_heading: NOW STRIP.
text: The MARQUIS begins to undress, hurriedly. First his tailcoat,
dialog: then his waistcoat.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: My shoes; they're naught but
dialog: punctuation.
text: COULMIER just glares. THE MARQUIS kicks them off, too. He
text: twists the amber ring off his finger.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: My jewels, family or otherwise?
text: Once again, COULMIER refuses to be roped into THE MARQUIS'
text: little game. THE MARQUIS seizes the ring in his teeth, and
text: proffers COULMIER a gritted, ugly smile. COULMIER plucks
text: the ring out of his maw. THE MARQUIS now stands in nothing
dialog: but his stockings and trousers.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Your breeches as well.
text: THE MARQUIS unhooks the first button on his breeches, then
text: waits, expectantly, for COULMIER to do the rest.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: You started this little game; you
dialog: finish it. Or haven't you the courage?
text: COULMIER falters; he wasn't expecting this.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (snorting derisively)
dialog: I thought not.
text: He lets his trousers drop. In the dim shadows, the MARQUIS
text: is naked now, except for his hair. He sidles up, close, to
dialog: COULMIER, his breath in the priest's ear:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it?
dialog: Power over another man.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Your wig. Remove your wig.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 78
text: The MARQUIS slides off his wig, and places it over his
text: privates, swinging it, like the tail of a horse. COULMIER
text: reaches out and grabs it away.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll no longer spread your insidious
dialog: gospel, where art's magnitude is the
dialog: breadth of its depravity! FROM NOW
dialog: ON, YOU WILL NOT EVEN WRITE YOUR OWN
speaker_heading: IGNOMINIOUS NAME!
dialog: So much anger seethes between them, it's electric.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Are your convictions so fragile that
dialog: mine cannot stand in opposition to
dialog: them? Is your God so flimsy? So weak?
dialog: For shame!
text: The thinnest trace of a smile dances on COULMIER's lips;
dialog: he's won this round, and he knows it.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Don't flatter yourself, Marquis.
dialog: You're not the Anti-Christ. You're
dialog: nothing but a malcontent who knows
dialog: how to spell.
text: With that, COULMIER exits with THE MARQUIS' clothing in his
text: arms. THE MARQUIS is left alone, naked and pathetic, in an
dialog: empty cell.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - MEANWHILE.
text: ROYER-COLLARD storms down the hall toward MADELEINE's

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: I saw her with my own eyes. She put

dialog: as you please--
scene_heading: EXT. CHARENTON - COURTYARD
text: Madeleine's head, framed against the sky
text: Reminiscent of the GUILLOTINE VICTIM in the film's opening
text: sequence. A SECOND HEAD looms into frame. Only--instead of
text: belonging to an EXECUTIONER--this one belongs to VALCOUR.
speaker_heading: PULL BACK TO REVEAL
text: VALCOUR ties MADELEINE's wrists to the posts of the well in
text: the center of the yard. With scissors, he slowly cuts the

dialog: p. 79
text: laces up the back of her corset, exposing her back. Next, he
text: raises a steel-tipped martinet, poised to whip.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE'S POV:
text: She singles out faces: ROYER-COLLARD, who watches imperiously
text: from a window above, GAILLON at his side. CHARLOTTE, who
text: watches the proceedings with smug satisfaction. MADAME
text: LECLERC, whose foggy eyes are filled with tears. MICHETTE,
text: LOUISON, GUERIN and ORVOLLE, all faces ripe with sympathy.
dialog: And--separated by a fence--the LUNATICS--FRANVAL, PITOU,
speaker_heading: CLEANTE, and DAUPHIN among them.
text: BOUCHON, a hideous scar on his cheek from the iron, all but
text: drools in anticipation.
dialog: VALCOUR looks to ROYER-COLLARD for permission to strike;
text: coolly ROYER-COLLARD grants it. MADELEINE flinches in
text: anticipation of the blow. It comes down, hard.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: ROYER-COLLARD
text: As MADELEINE shudders in pain, the DOCTOR can't help himself;
text: he quivers--ever so slightly--with pleasure. An angry welt
text: appears on MADELEINE's skin. Then another.
text: She chokes back tears, enduring her punishment with dignity.
speaker_heading: COULMIER bursts forth from the CROWD.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
speaker_heading: FREE HER. NOW.
text: VALCOUR stops short; he turns to ROYER-COLLARD. THE DOCTOR
dialog: stands, menacingly.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: He'll do no such thing.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: It's a weak man who tests his mettle
dialog: on the backs of children--
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: This child let loose the beast from
dialog: its cage--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Madeleine's not wicked. It's the
dialog: Marquis who's corrupted her. That's
dialog: not her fault; it's mine.
text: COULMIER turns to VALCOUR, and whispers urgently:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 80
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Your dagger. Give me your dagger.
dialog: VALCOUR looks to the DOCTOR; which superior should he honor?
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
speaker_heading: LEAVE HER DULY STRUNG.
text: COULMIER reaches out and slides the dagger from VALCOUR's
text: belt. He slices through the rope that binds MADELEINE; she
dialog: grabs him for support, and whispers urgently:
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: I was wrong to free him, but so are
dialog: you--for taking all his treasures--
dialog: his quills and his ink--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Not now, or we're both done for.
text: COULMIER turns back to ROYER-COLLARD and shouts:
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: If only blood will appease you, then
dialog: shed mine.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: You'd suffer in her stead?
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Abbe, no--
text: COULMIER proffers both fists to VALCOUR.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Go ahead. Bind them. Bind them.
text: Reluctantly, VALCOUR ties Coulmier's hands together. Next,
text: he hikes them over the whipping post. He loosens COULMIER's
text: vestments, stripping them to the waist. Next, he raises his
text: martinet and turns to ROYER-COLLARD for permission to strike.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: That won't be necessary.
text: A sigh of relief from the CROWD. As VALCOUR frees him,
text: COULMIER rubs his wrists. ROYER-COLLARD stares at him with
dialog: steel eyes.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: If you want to martyr yourself, Abbe,

dialog: Now put your clothes back on.

scene_heading: INT. CHARENTON - INFIRMARY - LATER THAT DAY
text: MADELEINE sits on the examining table, her bodice pulled
text: down around her waist. A severe-looking NUN prepares salve

dialog: folding screen--for modesty--and talks to MADELEINE; it takes
text: considerable strength of will to keep from peeking at her.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Had I known your taste in novels, I

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Don't say that; reading's my

speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: But why must you indulge in his

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: It's a hard day's wages, slaving
dialog: away for madmen. What I've seen in
dialog: life, it takes a lot to hold my
dialog: interest.
dialog: The NUN presses a sponge against a particularly nasty gash;
speaker_heading: MADELEINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: But why heap such ghastly fantasies
dialog: atop an already ghastly existence?
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: I put myself in his stories. I play
dialog: the parts. Each strumpet, each
dialog: murderess.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Why not act the role of heroines
dialog: instead? Queen Esther from the Bible,
dialog: or St. Joan?
speaker_heading: MADELEINE.(SIMPLY:)
dialog: If I wasn't such a bad woman on the

scene_heading: INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S CHATEAU - ATRIUM - LATER
text: ROYER-COLLARD sits at a table, ledger before him, MONSIEUR
text: PROUIX on one side, GAILLON on the other. Lining up for
dialog: payment, various CRAFTSMEN: a BRICKLAYER, perhaps, A
text: CARPENTER, A GARDENER. The DOCTOR hands a small sheath of

text: surprising sight: an incensed RENEE PELAGIE.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Good God, Marquise--
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my

dialog: you?
text: ROYER-COLLARD glances behind her; more MEN await payment.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: This is neither the time nor the

speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: If only you'd remained true to our
dialog: contract! Opiates, for his nerves!
dialog: Restraints! The man warrants a bed
dialog: of nails--
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: (sotto voice)
dialog: I can say, with the utmost sincerity,
dialog: that every franc you've given me has
dialog: been put to sterling use.
text: RENEE PELAGIE glances about the room, taking inventory of

speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Gentleman, if you'll excuse us...only

text: Amidst grumbles, GAILLON clears the room, closing the door
text: behind him. MONSIEUR PROUIX hovers behind it, listening.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You've no right to assault me in
dialog: this fashion; I'll call for my
dialog: footman. I'll have you removed--
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I
dialog: be betrayed by every man I meet--
text: SIMONE appears on the balcony above. She's overheard the
text: commotion, and senses something is amiss. The DOCTOR shifts
text: his gaze, staring up at her; RENEE PELAGIE notices that the

speaker_heading: face SIMONE.
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah! This must be the little Madame.
text: SIMONE offers a faint, uncertain smile.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: How do you do?
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: I must confess, I envy you.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Envy me? But why?
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: Your husband's name brings you honor,
dialog: doesn't it? You can walk down the
dialog: street without insult; without falling
dialog: debris.
text: RENEE PELAGIE's brow darkens with sinister pleasure; she
dialog: gestures at the riches in the room:
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: But suppose the whole world knew

speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
text: Public scorn carries a terrible sting.
dialog: Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
speaker_heading: RENEE PELAGIE
dialog: And why not? My fortune, siphoned
dialog: away. My reputation, past repair.
dialog: I've nothing left to lose.
dialog: (her eyes narrowing)
dialog: Silence my husband, or you'll come

scene_heading: EXT. A SEEDY BACKSTREET - PARIS
text: A YOUNG WOMAN navigates the winding streets. In her elegant
dialog: attire--notably the broad-brimmed hat which conceals her
dialog: face--she's clearly out of place in this neighborhood.
text: VENDORS in cramped shanties and make-shift stalls cry out to
text: THE WOMAN as she passes. Their VOICES fade in and out of one-
text: another, like a demented chorus. The FIRST is a hairy,
dialog: toothless bag o' bones:
speaker_heading: FIRST VENDOR
dialog: Psst...Mademoiselle....I've only a
dialog: few doses of Spanish fly left...
text: The WOMAN continues on her way, without glancing back. Her

dialog: jackal indeed.
speaker_heading: SECOND VENDOR
dialog: Cat-o'-nine-tails here, guaranteed
dialog: to raise a welt...
dialog: The THIRD--a feisty little DWARF--has nothing but herself to
dialog: sell. She coos to the WOMAN:
speaker_heading: THIRD VENDOR
dialog: Curious, aren't you? If I can pleasure
dialog: me-self, I can pleasure you, too...
text: At the end of the line, the WOMAN reaches the most decrepit

speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: (covertly)
dialog: I'm in search of a book; perhaps you

dialog: regards her warily.
speaker_heading: PAWNBROKER
dialog: I've only got copy left; rescued it
dialog: me-self from the bonfire.
text: SIMONE bats her eyes, hopefully. The PAWNBROKER sighs, reaches

dialog: shelf for the hidden key.
speaker_heading: SIMONE
dialog: Please hurry. My husband locks the

speaker_heading: SIMONE

text: GAILLON gives another YANK, dunking THE MARQUIS again with a
text: loud SPLASH. When he rises, THE MARQUIS hisses at GAILLON:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It thrills you, doesn't it, to hurt
dialog: me thus? Look, you're solid as bone,
dialog: you're straining your trousers--
text: Another dunk, another splash. THE MARQUIS tries a new tact:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop, I beg you! I'll write dainty
dialog: stories! Odes to Virtue! If even
dialog: your God will forgive me, so should
dialog: you--
dialog: Dunk, splash. Now, THE MARQUIS roars:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
scene_heading: EACH ABUSE--EACH TORMENT--ONLY
dialog: CALCIFIES MY RAGE! DON'T YOU SEE,
dialog: YOU MORON? YOU SELF-RIGHTEOUS FUCK!
speaker_heading: THE LONGER YOU CONTINUE YOUR

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: THE DUNGEON DOOR
dialog: We see the recipient of THE MARQUIS' spleen: peering through
text: the peephole, ROYER-COLLARD. In his eyes, some small measure
text: of vengeance, sated. He slips out of sight.
scene_heading: INT. MADELEINE'S ROOM - THAT NIGHT
text: MADELEINE tosses and turns on the straw mattress she shares
text: with her mother; perspiration plasters her hair to her face.
text: Finally, she crawls out of bed, and slips out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Torches light the way as MADELEINE moves down the corridor.
text: In the distance, we hear sounds previously unassociated with
dialog: Charenton: the clanking of chains and the wailing of inmates.
text: Perhaps GAILLON thunders down the hall, PITOU and DAUPHIN
text: under each arm. At last, MADELEINE reaches the ABBE's

speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: You shouldn't be calling on me, not
dialog: at this hour; suppose the
dialog: nightwatchman saw you, or the cook--
text: COULMIER sticks his head out the door, glancing to and fro,

speaker_heading: seeing MADELEINE.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: (cutting him off:)
dialog: Don't turn us out, Abbe.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: "Turn you out?"
text: Somewhere, a patient wails in the night; another pounds his

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: It's a sin against God for me to
dialog: refuse your kindness. But my heart's
dialog: held fast here...
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: By whom? The Marquis?
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: (with a rueful little
dialog: laugh)
dialog: Mother's not half so blind as you.
dialog: COULMIER understands the magnitude of MADELEINE's confession;
dialog: he also knows--all to well--its futility:
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Madeleine, I....there are certain
dialog: things...feelings...we must not voice.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: They incite us to act. In ways we

speaker_heading: COULMIER

dialog: With no choice before him, he lies:
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I love you, Madeleine, as a
dialog: parishioner--as a child of God--
text: COULMIER swings open the door. He summons all his willpower:
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: My vows are mine and mine alone. So
dialog: are my failings. Forgive me.
text: Stung, MADELEINE stifles a sob. She gives COULMIER a final

text: to walk off his arousal, circling the room like a prisoner
text: in a cage. Impulsively, he goes to the door and opens it

scene_heading: INT. THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE COULMIER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: COULMIER

speaker_heading: INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR
text: MADELEINE, still smarting from COULMIER's rejection, walks

scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT

speaker_heading: MADELEINE

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS

speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: He's a man of God; he's true to his

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: First and foremost, he's a MAN. You

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't you see, my sweet? In us, they

scene_heading: INT. EXT. THE CHARENTON ASYLUM - THAT NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. THE LINEN PANTRY - A SHORT TIME LATER.
text: MADELEINE swings open the door and sets down her laundry

text: with an orange glow. She closes the door behind her. Next,
text: she clears a space for herself on a small sewing table,
text: pushing aside a pin-cushion, bolts of thread, and a heavy
text: pair of scissors. She lifts a sheet off the top of the basket.

speaker_heading: INT. BOUCHON'S CELL

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: CLEANTE!
speaker_heading: INT. CLEANTE'S CELL
text: CLEANTE springs into action, rushing to the opposite side of
text: the room and perching on a chair. He whispers through a hole
dialog: by a beam in the ceiling:
speaker_heading: CLEANTE
dialog: "Fanchon was a prostitute with a
dialog: tight and downy fissure between her

speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (O.S.)
dialog: ...the most finely cleft ass...

dialog: Madeleine! Madeleine! Madeleine!
speaker_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: DAUPHIN runs up and down the hall, VALCOUR's keychain in
text: hand, unlocking cell after cell. The LUNATICS pour out.
text: They pick up the sing-song cry, screaming Madeleine's name
dialog: at a hideous pitch.
speaker_heading: LUNATICS
dialog: Madeleine! Madeleine! Madeleine!
speaker_heading: INT. COULMIER'S QUARTERS
text: COULMIER's awakened by the sounds of the LUNATICS crying
dialog: "Madeleine! Madeleine!" He starts pulling on his vestments
dialog: with trembling hands.
scene_heading: INT. THE SERVANT'S CORRIDOR/MADELEINE'S ROOM
text: COULMIER rushes down the hall and glances into MADELEINE's
text: QUARTERS. MADAME LECLERC lies alone in the bed she shares
dialog: with her daughter.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Madeleine--
text: MADAME LECLERC stirs, reaching out for her child, patting
text: the lumpy mattress, hoping to touch her.
speaker_heading: MADAME LECLERC
dialog: Maddy? Where are you now? Maddy?
scene_heading: INT. CHARENTON - MAIN STAIRCASE (LUTON HOO)
text: A burning pillow cascades down, trailing straw. As COULMIER
text: bounds downstairs, he catches sight of a figure: a
speaker_heading: CHAMBERMAID, rushing past.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Madeleine--
text: He follows her, dodging MADMEN brandishing broomsticks,
text: bedsheets, and the splintered remnants of furniture.
scene_heading: INT. CHARENTON - INFIRMARY
text: The CHAMBERMAID enters the infirmary; COULMIER races after
dialog: her. He has to fight his way past Charenton's MOST DIRE CASES,
text: who lurch toward him in the smokey haze like zombies.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 108
text: An aging MADMEN with elephantiasis; a WITHERED OLD CRONE in
text: a stolen nun's habit with a hideous grin, her hands thrust
text: under her own skirts; ONE AILING MADMAN carries ANOTHER
text: through the murk; a demented pieta. In the background,
dialog: curtains blaze.
text: COULMIER catches sight of the CHAMBERMAID. He makes a bee-
text: line for her, grabs her by the arm, and swirls her around.
dialog: It's not MADELEINE at all, but CHARLOTTE. COULMIER can't
text: help it; his face betrays dismay.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: It's her fault the Devil's unleashed
dialog: himself upon us...it's her fault...
text: COULMIER thrusts CHARLOTTE aside.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Madeleine! Madeleine!
text: From outside, a horrible scream. COULMIER's eyes fill with
dialog: alarm.
scene_heading: INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S OFFICE
text: ROYER-COLLARD empties the last dregs from his wine bottle; a
text: pitiful little puddle in the bottom of his glass. Before
text: him, the asylum record books in grave disarray. GAILLON
text: lounges in a near-by chair. As the DIN of the RIOT grows
dialog: around them, they exchange a look; one that says "We knew
dialog: this would happen. How could it not?"
scene_heading: EXT. CHARENTON - TERRACE.
text: COULMIER, soaked in the rain, searches the courtyard. All
text: around him, WARDS--like pagans--are stripping off their
text: clothes, dancing in the storm. PITOU rides atop GUERIN's
text: shoulders; LOUISON tries to beat him off with an andiron.
text: The scream again; COULMIER whirls around, expecting to see
text: MADELEINE. Again, his hopes are dashed. It's MICHETTE, pinned
text: to the wall, set upon by a group of LASCIVIOUS WARDS, their
text: limbs all intertwined in an orgiastic frenzy.
text: ONE BESTIAL MAN turns to look at COULMIER, his eyes wild, a
text: scrap of MICHETTE's clothing dripping from his mouth, like a
dialog: flap of flesh.
text: COULMIER dives in to rescue her, but--instead--he's set upon
text: by more MISCREANTS, who tug at his robes and paw at his hair,
dialog: like creatures turning on their Master.

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROYER-COLLARD'S OFFICE
text: From above, the insistent, demonic chanting of Madeleine's
text: name. GAILLON bursts from the office and makes for the
text: stairs; ROYER-COLLARD strides out after him, glancing
dialog: imperiously this way and that.
scene_heading: INT. THE MARQUIS APARTMENT
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (a desperate howl)
speaker_heading: MADELEINE!
scene_heading: EXT. CHARENTON - TERRACE
text: Still fending off MADMEN, COULMIER bellows at the sky:
speaker_heading: COULMIER
speaker_heading: MADELEINE!
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE LINEN PANTRY
text: As he passes, ROYER-COLLARD hears a scuffle from within.
text: He pauses, and reaches for the knob. Just then, he hears
text: COULMIER and THE MARQUIS in the distance, each crying out
dialog: for Madeleine. From the pantry, her Voice:
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Abbe? Is that you?...He means to
dialog: kill me...save me as you have
dialog: before...I beg you...I'm sorry for
dialog: all that I said...please...oh,
dialog: please...
text: ROYER-COLLARD's face calcifies with hate. From inside, a
text: heart-piercing scream. He feels a surge of victory in his
text: chest, and lifts his hand from the knob.
scene_heading: INT. THE GRAND STAIRCASE AT CHARENTON
text: Cinders fall from above. Poised along the stair, ORVOLLE,
text: VALCOUR and GAILLON. They're passing pails of water upward
text: in an effort to quell the flames. ROYER-COLLARD joins the
text: line, passing a sloshing bucket from ORVOLLE to VALCOUR
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Quickly now! Altogether men, as one!
text: ORVOLLE looks at him, surprised to see the aloof DOCTOR
dialog: suddenly so pro-active.

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
text: QUICKLY! Before it reaches the rafters
dialog: on the upper floors--
text: GAILLON gazes at his BOSS with glowing admiration. Coming
dialog: down the stairs--disoriented in the smoke and the melee--
text: MADAME LECLERC. With one hand, she clings to the railing.
text: With the other, she grasps at the air.
speaker_heading: MADAME LECLERC
dialog: Maddy! Where are you, child? Maddy!
dialog: The LUNATIC QUARTET--in their night drawers, their faces
text: blackened with ash--trundle after her, playing a jaunty tune.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE THE MARQUIS' APARTMENT
text: COULMIER--his cassock torn and soaked through, his face
text: scratched--races down the stairs THE MARQUIS, meanwhile,
dialog: screams bloody murder from the peephole in his cell:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Let me out your morons! Let me loose!
text: COULMIER catches his eye, and shoots an accusatory glare.
dialog: "You've played a part in this, haven't you?" he seems to be
text: asking. THE MARQUIS turns silent, even stony, staring back
text: at COULMIER with lethal eyes. COULMIER moves on.
speaker_heading: INT. BOUCHON'S CELL
text: COULMIER races through the room. He sees the dismantled door,
text: lifted off its hinges, lying sideways against the wall.
scene_heading: INT. THE LINEN PANTRY
text: COULMIER's eyes dart feverishly about; the linens are drenched
text: in blood. He glances down at his feet; he sees a few pieces
text: of parchment. He picks up a sheet. The last sentence reads
dialog: "tear out her tongue" before trailing off the page. He
text: recognizes the curve of MADELEINE's script.
text: His heart pounding, he moves toward the laundry room,
text: terrified of what he might find. Underfoot, a growing pool
dialog: of water.
speaker_heading: COULMIER'S POV:
text: At the far end of the laundry room, BOUCHON, dripping wet,
text: his lower lip quivering like a naughty child, recedes into
text: the shadows. Meanwhile, MADAME LECLERC emerges from the
text: smoke, clutching her stirring stick like a pike for
text: protection. THE SOUND OF WATER SLOSHING.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 111
text: She turns, her face full of dread.
dialog: ANGLE ON: THE LAUNDRY VAT.
text: Water cascades down the sides of the vat. MADAME LECLERC
text: climbs atop her pedestal, inserts her stick into the brew,
dialog: and begins to stir.
text: COULMIER stands, dizzy, the room spinning around him in a
dialog: mad whirl that becomes...
text: THE SWIRLING WATERS OF THE LAUNDRY VAT. Rising to the surface
text: like a phantom from the mist, MADELEINE. Her skin is
text: translucent blue. As her corpse rolls in the water, we see
text: that it is riddled with scissor gashes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CHARENTON/PAVILION - THE NEXT DAY - DAWN
text: The sun turns the horizon a feverish red. In the distance, a
text: cock crows. ORVOLLE and LOUISON nail wooden planks across
dialog: Charenton's windows; WORKMEN fortify the grounds with
text: barriers. The asylum stands, like an injured beast, too
dialog: obstinate--and now, too cruel--to die.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: THE PAVILION.
text: The HORSEMAN waits, but there's no one to greet him with a
text: manuscript. A final, lingering look and--dejected--he turns
text: to leave. His horse rears up on its hind legs in distress,
text: then gallops away through the morning mist.
scene_heading: INT. BOUCHON'S CELL - THAT AFTERNOON
text: The door swings open, and light illuminates BOUCHON. As soon
text: as he sees VALCOUR and GAILLON in the doorway, he scuttles
dialog: under his cot.
speaker_heading: VALCOUR
dialog: Now, now. Don't be shy. We've a nice
dialog: surprise just waiting for you...
text: BOUCHON peers out from beneath the bed.
speaker_heading: VALCOUR (CONT'D)
dialog: That's a good boy.
scene_heading: INT. THE DUNGEON - MINUTES LATER
text: Sweat trickles in tiny rivulets down BOUCHON's forehead. We

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 112
speaker_heading: PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
text: VALCOUR and GAILLON, soldering shut the iron dummy. BOUCHON's
text: eyes bulge as he's encased--forever--in a sarcophagus made
dialog: of steel.
speaker_heading: PULL BACK EVEN FURTHER TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROYER-COLLARD'S OFFICE -MORNING
text: ROYER-COLLARD closes the door to the dungeon, and cracks his
text: knuckles with barely-controlled fury. COULMIER sits, his
dialog: head bowed.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Of course, we mustn't blame Bouchon;
dialog: he's merely one of Nature's
dialog: experiments, gone awry. No discipline.
dialog: No conscience. No morality.
dialog: He rears up from behind his desk:
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: In fact, it is our duty to provide
dialog: those things on his behalf. Is it
dialog: not?
text: COULMIER raises his head. His eyes are red from crying, but
dialog: he's resolved not to lose his temper before the DOCTOR.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: As you say, Doctor.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: He was so impressed with the Marquis'
dialog: tale that he chose to re-enact it,
dialog: yes? Upon a certain chambermaid.
text: COULMIER nods. ROYER_COLLARD blithely sticks the knife in
dialog: and gives it a turn.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind
dialog: me of her name...
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
speaker_heading: HER NAME, ABBE.
dialog: COULMIER chokes back a sob and manages:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 113
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Madeleine.
text: THE DOCTOR tosses MADELEINE's bloody manuscript onto the
text: center of the desk, and lays into COULMIER savagely:
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: So tell me: when you're called before
dialog: God, how will you answer for
dialog: Madeleine's death?
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - SHORT TIME LATER
text: COULMIER blazes down the hall, torch in hand.
scene_heading: INT. A PIT - CONTINUOUS
text: COULMIER climbs down a spiral stair built along the parameters
text: of an enormous pit. In its center, a LUNATIC, crouched in a
text: feral pose. He wears a heavy iron collar with four long
text: chains, each strapped to a different wall in the room. He no
text: longer resembles a man; he looks like a beast, trapped in a
text: stone cage; it's THE MARQUIS. He peers into the gloom with
dialog: wolverine eyes.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Murderer!
dialog: THE MARQUIS blurts, defensively:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Your words drove Bouchon to--
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to
dialog: do? Police my readers as you police
dialog: me? Suppose one of your precious
dialog: wards had attempted to walk on water
dialog: and drowned? Would you condemn the
dialog: Bible? I think not!
speaker_heading: COULMIER
text: An innocent child is dead.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: (icily)
dialog: So many authors are denied the
dialog: gratification of a concrete response
dialog: to their work. I am blessed, am I
dialog: not?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 114
text: This flagrant disregard for MADELEINE cuts through COULMIER.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: It's no secret that you loved her.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Oh, that's rich--coming from her
dialog: lapdog--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I saw the longing in your eye--
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: --that was lust--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: --the passion in your heart--
dialog: THE MARQUIS grabs his own crotch:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Don't confuse one organ with another--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I know, because I felt it myself--
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
speaker_heading: COULMIER
speaker_heading: AND DID YOU?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: You're no stranger to rape, Marquis;
dialog: and yet with her, you cooed. You
dialog: courted. You begged.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Go to hell!
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Why was it you never took her by
dialog: force?
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Who's to say I did not?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Was it impotence?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 115
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
speaker_heading: NEVER!
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Then it must've been love--
text: The MARQUIS chokes on COULMIER's last word.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN
dialog: EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE,
speaker_heading: SHE PLEAD FOR MORE--
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: (triumphant)
dialog: We inspected the body, Marquis. She
dialog: died a virgin.
text: A stunned pause. The MARQUIS cracks--a tiny cry at first,
text: which erupts into genuine sobbing. He sinks to his knees,
text: and claws the dirt with his hands. Finally, he whispers:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Give her a proper burial. In the
dialog: churchyard, at my expense. Do not
dialog: inter her sweet body in the same
dialog: ground as the devils who inhabit
dialog: this accursed place.
dialog: Pause, and then:
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Your terrible secret, revealed. You're
dialog: a man, after all.
text: Suddenly--savagely--THE MARQUIS spits in his face.
text: COULMIER wipes away the indignity. He stands, severe now.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: All that remains now is your
dialog: punishment.
dialog: THE MARQUIS extends his arm:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one
dialog: of us will bleed?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 116
dialog: For once, THE MARQUIS' balks.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT.OPERATING THEATRE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP: THE MARQUIS' LEFT HAND
text: VALCOUR manacles it to an operating table.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP: THE MARQUIS' RIGHT HAND.
text: VALCOUR cuffs it, too. Next, GAILLON splays the MARQUIS'
text: feet, and clamps them in irons. He buckles leather restraints
text: around the MARQUIS' torso. The MARQUIS cranes his head, and
text: glances at the table beside him. On it, primitive medical
text: instruments, laid out ominously in a row. A RAT scurries
dialog: across them.
text: GAILLON sharpens his blade on a stone. COULMIER watches.
speaker_heading: GAILLON
dialog: I've opium to numb the pain.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: (crisply:)
dialog: Our intention here is punitive. If
dialog: we numb the pain, what's the point?
text: The MARQUIS twists his neck to find the PRIEST:
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Abbe de Coulmier!
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I'm here.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Surely you'll grant me a final word.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: (terse)
dialog: Of course.
text: The MARQUIS' eyes flash with malevolence.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS
dialog: Would that I were so easily silenced.
text: COULMIER wrenches his hand free. GAILLON raises his scalpel,
dialog: and looks to COULMIER for permission to begin.
speaker_heading: COULMIER nods.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 117
text: INT. OUTSIDE THE OPERATING THEATER
text: From within, an animal cry. COULMIER walks down the corridor,
text: away from the grisly proceedings. On his face, a tiny flicker;
dialog: perhaps--somewhere deep down in his soul--he feels the thrill
dialog: of victory.
scene_heading: INT. CHARENTON. ROYER-COLLARD'S OFFICE - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: The DOCTOR is knee-deep in paperwork; COULMIER bursts into
text: the room. He slams a glass jar down on the DOCTOR's desk.
dialog: Bobbling in alcohol, THE MARQUIS' tongue, so long and
text: serpentine it's wrapped around a dowel.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: My, my. You have exceeded my
dialog: expectations.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: And my own.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: How is the patient faring?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Poorly.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: And you? It must've been an ordeal.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I'm not the first man God has asked
dialog: to shed blood in His name. I will
dialog: not be the last.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Will you sleep soundly tonight?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: (faltering)
dialog: No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect
dialog: to sleep again.
scene_heading: INT. CHARENTON - CHAPEL - LATER.
text: On a slab in the center of the chapel lies MADELEINE, draped
text: in white silk. A CREAK as the door opens. COULMIER approaches
text: the body, and places a wreath of newly-cut flowers at
text: MADELEINE's head. He kneels to pray. In a voice choking with
dialog: emotion, he mumbles:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 118
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: "In nomine patris et filii et spiritu
dialog: santu..."
text: A bead of sweat trickles down COULMIER's face. He takes the
text: hem of MADELEINE's death shroud, and wipes the droplet away.
text: The shroud slides off MADELEINE's face. She lies dormant.
text: Her skin is rosy, and her lips are slightly parted. Unable
text: to resist, COULMIER tugs the shroud off further, exposing
text: her shoulders. COULMIER marvels at her breasts, sloping
text: beneath the fabric. His heart pounds like a kettle drum.
text: Impulsively, COULMIER pulls the shroud all the way off.
text: MADELEINE lies before him, flawless. There are no wounds, no
dialog: sign of the gore which accompanied her death.
text: He gazes at her with an almost child-like wonder. Slowly, he
text: circles the body. Tentatively, he reaches out his finger to
dialog: touch her lips; to trace the white porcelain of her
text: collarbone; perhaps even graze his hand across her breast.
text: He hesitates, then he leans down to kiss her. It's an almost
text: chaste moment, but it stuns her awake.
text: MADELEINE lives. COULMIER leaps back, alarmed. But MADELEINE
text: wraps her arms around his neck. She returns the kiss,
dialog: passionately.
dialog: It's all the encouragement COULMIER needs; he crawls astride
text: her on the slab. Soon, he's running his hands in and out of
text: her rounded thighs, feeling each hollow, each moist crevice.
text: His touch grows from gentle to frantic as desire mounts.
speaker_heading: MADELEINE
dialog: Ah!
text: Roughly, COULMIER parts her legs. She grabs his back, her
text: nails digging into his skin, as though she were hanging on
dialog: for dear life. With a guttural sound--his Id, at last
text: unleashed--COULMIER grimaces with pleasure and enters her.
text: One savage thrust; then two. His eyes light on the crucifix
text: hanging across from him on the wall.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: THE CRUCIFIX.
text: CHRIST's forehead is pierced through with nettles, and blood
text: flows in tiny rivers down his face. He stares at COULMIER.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON: COULMIER
text: who shudders and glances down at the body beneath him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 119
text: COULMIER's POV: The lifeless corpse of MADELEINE bearing the
dialog: wounds which killed her, desecrated, on the cold marble.
speaker_heading: ABRUPT CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COULMIER'S QUARTERS -NIGHT
text: COULMIER's eyes bolt open. He lurches upright, and tries to
text: stay the bile rising in his throat. A loud knocking at his
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: VALCOUR (O.S.)
dialog: Abbe! You'd best come quick.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: VALCOUR and COULMIER move down the hall like bullets down
dialog: the barrel of a gun.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT - CONTINUOUS
text: VALCOUR unlocks the wrought-iron gate, and they enter.
text: Gasping for breath, VALCOUR covers his face with a
text: handkerchief. He raises his lantern. In the din--flickering
text: orange--words. Everywhere, words. On the ceiling. Written on
text: the floor. Etched on the walls. It's as if the TWO MEN have
dialog: stumbled into the tomb of Tutankhamen, with its glyphic texts,
dialog: or a Sanskrit monument covered in symbols.
speaker_heading: VALCOUR
dialog: He spat into his own filth. Made
dialog: himself a kind of paint.
text: COULMIER stares, awe-struck. He can't help but be impressed;
dialog: the effort is nothing less than Herculean.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Dear God.
text: COULMIER glances down to the pit's base. There, the MARQUIS
text: lies, his face pale and his breathing shallow. In spite of
text: his decrepitude, there's the look of triumph in his eyes. A
dialog: look which says, "I persevered."
text: COULMIER rushes to him. He feels for his heart-beat; it's
text: faint. The MARQUIS tries to speak, but the soiled bandage
text: across his mouth prevents him. He can only murmur. COULMIER
speaker_heading: calls up to VALCOUR.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Free his mouth.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 120
speaker_heading: VALCOUR
dialog: Mustn't do that, sir.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: I must grant him his last rites.
speaker_heading: VALCOUR
dialog: I don't take my orders from you; not
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
text: Sullenly, VALCOUR tosses his knife down to the ground, then
text: recedes into darkness. COULMIER tenderly cradles the MARQUIS'
text: head in his lap, and mops his brow. He takes the knife and
text: delicately snips the bandage; it falls away.
text: Slowly, painfully, the MARQUIS parts his lips. He coughs for
text: air. He tries to speak, but--sans his tongue--he can't form
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Shhh...shhh...
dialog: (praying softly)
dialog: Dear Heavenly Father. Prove Your
dialog: infinite mercy, and open Your gates
dialog: to this man, no less Your child than
dialog: any other.
text: COULMIER kisses the MARQUIS' forehead. He makes a painful
dialog: admission for the first time:
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: There is...in each of us...such
dialog: beauty... and such abomination.
dialog: No...man...is ...exempt.
text: The MARQUIS tries to smile. COULMIER smiles, too, his eyes
text: brimming with tears. The old affection between the two men
dialog: is evident, even now.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Forgive him. Forgive us all.
text: COULMIER places the small ivory crucifix of his rosary over
speaker_heading: the MARQUIS's mouth.
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
dialog: There now. Kiss the cross.
text: A flicker of life in the MARQUIS's eyes; a remnant of his
text: old self. He opens his mouth savagely, and grabs the crucifix
dialog: in his teeth.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 121
text: COULMIER tries to wrest it out, but the MARQUIS clamps down
text: tighter with his teeth. The chain breaks; rosary beads go
text: streaming across his face, bouncing across the stone floor.
text: With concerted effort--almost gagging--the MARQUIS swallows.
dialog: COULMIER watches, appalled. We see the shape of the cross--
text: in relief--as it inches down the MARQUIS' gullet, beneath
text: his skin. Finally--with a last gulp--the crucifix goes down;
speaker_heading: The MARQUIS has ingested Christ.
text: THE MARQUIS' pupils roll back into his lids. He stares at
text: COULMIER with a lifeless gaze. COULMIER finally breaks; he
dialog: lets loose with a primal cry:
speaker_heading: COULMIER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
scene_heading: INT. DAUPHIN'S CELL - MEANWHILE
text: DAUPHIN is shackled to the wall; his skull has been trephined,
dialog: and bears the trace of his own barbaric surgery.
text: He hears the scream, echoing down the corridor. His face

text: ROYER-COLLARD greets ABBE DU MAUPAS, a youthful priest with

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
speaker_heading: ABBE DU MAUPAS
dialog: I'm pleased to have the new post,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: I'm afraid that our endowment has
dialog: shriveled to a mere pittance; we're
dialog: the laughing stock of all France.
dialog: But--on a happier note--
text: The DOCTOR smiles, and pats the ABBE jovially on the arm.

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: The Charenton Press, Abbe.
text: ROYER-COLLARD waves toward a bank of printer's desks, where
dialog: a few PATIENTS--FRANVAL among them--are setting type, their

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: The compulsive inmates set the type--

speaker_heading: ABBE DU MAUPAS
dialog: It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients

speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: They've the satisfaction only a hard

text: ABBE DU MAUPAS notices the title page: Opus Sadicum.
speaker_heading: ABBE DU MAUPAS
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: I don't believe it. The Marquis de

dialog: novels?
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Ever since his unfortunate death,
dialog: there's been a surge of interest in
dialog: his work. I'll use the profits to

speaker_heading: A WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, Doctor.
dialog: It's CHARLOTTE. No longer a common chambermaid, she looks

speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: You've a meeting with Herr Becker at
dialog: four o'clock. He wants to publish a
dialog: Swiss edition--on gilded paper, bound
dialog: in calfskin.
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: Thank-you, Charlotte.
dialog: CHARLOTTE turns coquettish; she and the DOCTOR exchange a
dialog: telling smile; theirs is more than a professional alliance.
speaker_heading: CHARLOTTE
dialog: My pleasure. Truly.

text: ABBE DU MAUPAS steps forward to get a look at the MADMAN
text: inside; A FIGURE stands with his back to us. His hair is
dialog: long and unkept. The PATIENT speaks:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: So you're my successor. Yes?
text: Slowly, the speaker turns around. It's COULMIER. The ABBE--
dialog: startled-- exchanges a look with ROYER-COLLARD; who is this
dialog: haunted figure?
speaker_heading: ABBE DU MAUPAS
dialog: My successor?
text: COULMIER barks a scabrous laugh, then abruptly changes his
text: tone. He presses himself against the door, and implores DU
speaker_heading: MAUPAS:
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Listen to me, Abbe, and listen well.

speaker_heading: defy ROYER-COLLARD:
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Prove you've an ounce of Christian
dialog: charity...Bring me parchment...ink...
dialog: and a quill.
dialog: ABBE DU MAUPAS looks to the DOCTOR; what should he do?
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: You'll do no such thing. This patient
dialog: poses a grave danger, to himself and
dialog: to others.
text: With lightning speed, COULMIER reaches through the peephole,
text: grabbing ROYER-COLLARD by the collar. He yanks him, hard,
text: against the door, strangling him with his own cravatte. The
text: DOCTOR's face starts turning purple.
dialog: ABBE DU MAUPAS pauses for a moment; who should he honor?
dialog: His employer, or the mad prophet in the cell? Impulsively he
text: acts, loosening COULMIER's grip on the DOCTOR. ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: gasps for air.
speaker_heading: ABBE DU MAUPAS
dialog: Are you all right, sir?
speaker_heading: COULMIER
dialog: Don't you see--
speaker_heading: ROYER-COLLARD
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Don't you see, Abbe?
dialog: A pause, and then contemptuously:

speaker_heading: INT. COULMIER'S CELL
text: Discouraged, COULMIER slides down to the ground, defeated.
text: He hardly notices when the trap opens, and a bundle of sheets
text: tumbles forth. Hoping against all hope, he folds the top
text: sheet back. There--nestled in the fabric--an ink well,
text: parchment, and a quill. He leaps to his feet, and slides
text: open the peephole. Staring back at him: the milky eyes of
speaker_heading: MADAME LECLERC.
speaker_heading: MADAME LECLERC

dialog: COULMIER scribbles away with all the fervor--the mission--
text: of a man frantic to impart his story to the world.
speaker_heading: THE MARQUIS (CONT'D)
dialog: "Be forewarned: its plot is
dialog: bloodsoaked, its characters depraved
