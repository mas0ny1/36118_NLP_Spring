speaker_heading: STUMP
dialog: Yes! The muse has left me
text: stranded here like a beached
dialog: whale -- only one phrase, one
dialog: word, from finishing the greatest
dialog: essay I've ever written! One
dialog: word, the right word -- Flaubert
dialog: called it 'le mot juste' -- I
dialog: ever tell you that?
text: Lucille is a longsuffering saint.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: 'Le mot juste' -- the exact right
dialog: word the writer needs to tell his
dialog: story. Yessir, you've mentioned
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: STUMP
dialog: Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce --
dialog: they all searched for 'le mot
dialog: juste' until they cried, until

speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Yessir.
speaker_heading: STUMP
dialog: What is this essay about again?
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Fishing.
speaker_heading: STUMP

speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: You said it was about the quote

speaker_heading: STUMP (V.O.)
dialog: The 'facts' -- and public
dialog: perception of those 'facts' --
dialog: frequently bear little

text: Onscreen (B&amp;W) -- Cobb in action -- His demon fury gives

speaker_heading: STUMP (V.O.)

speaker_heading: STUMP (V.O.)

dialog: with the same old guys, the same

speaker_heading: COBB
dialog: (suddenly bellowing)
dialog: Jameson! Get your ass up here!
text: Cobb grabs another bottle of booze and swigs deeply,

speaker_heading: STUMP

speaker_heading: COBB

speaker_heading: COBB

speaker_heading: STUMP
dialog: So I'm taking notes?
speaker_heading: COBB

speaker_heading: STUMP
dialog: I ain't writing it.
speaker_heading: COBB
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: STUMP
dialog: It's horseshit. It's a third

speaker_heading: COBB

speaker_heading: COBB
dialog: They give me Darvon for the

speaker_heading: STUMP

speaker_heading: LOUIS PRIMA

text: playing a faggot game in their

speaker_heading: COBB
dialog: 'Course the Globetrotters are

speaker_heading: COBB

speaker_heading: OFFSTAGE
text: The Casino Manager winces and consults.
speaker_heading: CASINO MANAGER

dialog: the pitch... you let the bat do
dialog: the work... it's all rhythm and
dialog: flow...
