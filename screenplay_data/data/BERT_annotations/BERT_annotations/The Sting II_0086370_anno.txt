scene_heading: EXT. ATLANTIC CITY NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
text: It's a balmy night in August, 1940. We open on the exterior
text: of a swank Atlantic City nightclub, its dazzling facade
text: illuminating a passing parade of hipsters, which stops like
text: a freeze dance every time the club door opens and allows a
text: few bars of the music within to escape. It's the dream of
text: every hipster that a party of fifteen will come out, keeping
text: the door open long enough perhaps to hear Ziggy Elman's
dialog: entire trumpet solo on "Body and Soul'.

text: This time, however, only a couple emerges, accompanied at
text: best by a few diminished eighth notes. The man, elegantly
text: dressed and refined in manner, is immediately recognizable

text: As Twist leans forward to give instructions to the cabbie,
text: he fails to notice that the woman slides right out the other
text: side. He turns to find that her place has been taken by a
text: huge hulk of a man who says nothing and stares straight
text: ahead. Twist has seen that look before and moves to get out
text: the way he cam in, only to find that there is now a thug on
text: the other side of him too. This one closes the door beside
text: him and assumes the same pose as his friend. Twist realizes
text: that he's in trouble. The cabbie pulls out with no word
text: from the thugs. It doesn't matter. He knows better than

text: amusement park across the street. The only sound in the
text: room comes from an unseen fan. The camera stops when we're
text: close enough to realize that the man is Doyle Lonnegan the

text: room. It looks like an expensive suite in any luxury hotel,

text: 2. shadow boxing in front of a mirror;
text: 3. practicing his crossing punches on the âpunch
dialog: catchers' held by The Big Ohio;
text: 4. working the speed bag. He has a little trouble
text: with this last one, as his timing is not yet sharp.
dialog: All of this training is done under the supervision of The Big
text: Ohio, who seems to be very knowledgeable about fighting.
scene_heading: INT. GOLDING'S GYM - DAY - ON HOOKER 125
text: We come out of the montage with Hooker throwing combinations
text: into the heavy bag. lorff (in black face and the ivory
text: suit) and The Big Ohio are watching him. Hooker is sweating
text: profusely and obviously getting a little tired. The rest of
