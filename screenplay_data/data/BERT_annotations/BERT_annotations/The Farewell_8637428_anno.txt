text: A PAINTING displays an idyllic landscape, bathed in

text: sounds of a Chinese announcement amidst other bustling
text: hospital sounds.
text: A phone buzzes, answered by an authoritative female voice.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (0.S.)
dialog: [Hello?]
dialog: [*Note: All Chinese Mandarin dialogue in brackets. Other
dialog: languages will not be subtitled. ]
text: NAI NAI (80) walks into frame holding a cell phone. A head of
text: neatly-permed white hair, this woman is the consummate
dialog: matriarch.
speaker_heading: BILLI (0.S.)
dialog: [Nai Nai. Hi!]
text: Hearing her granddaughter’s cheerful voice, Nai Nai breaks
text: into a warm smile.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: (Billi! It’s the middle of the
dialog: night there, why aren’t you
dialog: sleeping? ]
speaker_heading: BILLI (0.S.)

speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [Seven at night?]
scene_heading: EXT. NYC - EVENING
text: Horns BLARE as BILLI WANG (30) walks quickly through the
text: kinetic streets of New York City. She’s in her element here.
text: Her movement is effortless, even as she switches between
text: speaking Mandarin and English.
text: WE INTERCUT BETWEEN THEIR PHONE CONVERSATION.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [Yea, it's always twelve hours time
dialog: difference! Isn’t it seven in the
dialog: morning in China?]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [It’s almost seven thirty!]

speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [Is it cold there? Are you wearing
dialog: enough? Cold travels through the
dialog: head! Are you wearing a hat?]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: {I am.]
dialog: (she’s definitely not)
dialog: [Stop worrying about me! ]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [You have to be careful. I read
dialog: that in New York there are men who
dialog: steal your earrings. They rip them
dialog: out! And then you have to go to the
dialog: hospital to get your ears stitched
dialog: up!]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [I’m not wearing earrings, Nai
dialog: Nail]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: (Ah. So you heard too. ]
text: A loud Chinese ANNOUNCEMENT blares through the phone.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [Hey, what’s that sound? Nai Nai,
dialog: where are you?]
text: The announcement continues.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: (Me? I'm... I'm at your great
dialog: aunt’s house. ]
text: Clearly in a hospital, Nai Nai tells this lie with total
dialog: ease.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [What are you doing? ]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [I’m heading to Mom and Dad's for
dialog: dinner...]
text: Before Billi can finish, a STREET CANVASSER interrupts with
dialog: performative cheerfulness.
scene_heading: STREET CANVASSER
dialog: Hi! Do you have a minute to save
dialog: the polar bears?
text: Billi stares blankly, annoyed by the interruption.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: I really wanna say something
dialog: snarky, but I used to have your
dialog: job.
scene_heading: STREET CANVASSER
dialog: (still smiling)
dialog: So you know how important it is to
dialog: support us!
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: I know your job sucks.
text: Suddenly sympathetic, Billi stops.
speaker_heading: BILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: [Hold on, Nai Nai...]
text: She pulls out her wallet. All she has is a dollar. She hands
text: it to the stranger, who eyes it cynically.
scene_heading: STREET CANVASSER
dialog: Lemme guess, you got fired?
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: (feigns being offended)
dialog: I quit!
dialog: (beat, with a laugh)

speaker_heading: BILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: [Sorry, Nai Nai.]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: (What was that?]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: (Nothing. Just um... a friend...]
text: Another announcement blares through the hospital speakers.
speaker_heading: BILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: (Hey, Nai Nai, what is that? What’s
dialog: going on?]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [It’s nothing. I’1l call you back
dialog: later, OK?]
text: Nai Nai’s abruptness catches Billi slightly off-guard.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Uh, OK...
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [I’1l call you back granddaughter!
dialog: I promise I’1l1 call you back!]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: OK. [Call me la...]
text: The line clicks before Billi can finish. It’s odd, but Billi
text: shrugs it off and descends into the subway station.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, CT SCAN MACHINE - DAY
text: The bed slides out of the machine. A RADIOLOGIST helps Nai
text: Nai sit up.
speaker_heading: RADIOLOGIST
dialog: [You can get dressed. ]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [Where's my sister?]
speaker_heading: RADIOLOGIST
dialog: [She’s with the doctor. ]
scene_heading: INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, DOCTOR WU'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Little Nai Nai sits alone across from DOCTOR WU. Though we
text: don't hear their conversation, Little Nai Nai absorbs what is
text: clearly terrible news.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - DAY
text: Little Nai Nai is overwhelmed with grief, but there’s no time
text: for this. Her mind races. Then, with a deep breath, she makes
dialog: her decision. Yes, it’s clear what she must do.
scene_heading: INT. THE PEOPLE’S HOSPITAL, WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: Little Nai Nai approaches her distressed sister in the
text: waiting room. She musters up a believable smile.
speaker_heading: LITTLE NAI NAI
dialog: (OK, let's go.]
text: Her voice is light and bright.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [Did you talk to the doctor?]
speaker_heading: LITTLE NAI NAI
dialog: [Yep. You're in full health. ]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: (Really? What about the CT scan?
dialog: What about the spots they saw
dialog: before? ]
speaker_heading: LITTLE NAI NAI
dialog: [It's all clear. Turned out to be
dialog: nothing. Just... benign shadows. ]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [Benign shadows? What's that mean?]
speaker_heading: LITTLE NAI NAI
dialog: (shrugs nonchalantly)
dialog: [That's just what the doctor said.]
text: Nai Nai seems uncertain as she looks at her sister’s beaming
text: smile. Little Nai Nai helps her stand, still radiating with
dialog: optimism.
text: As they leave the hospital, Nai Nai seems sufficiently
dialog: convinced.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN (0.S.)
dialog: (prelap)
dialog: «++. and one day the wife goes out

text: HAIYAN WANG (late 50’s), also known as DAD, smiles with self-

dialog: joke.
text: Billi watches her father adoringly, sipping brandy around the
text: remains of their dinner.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: The wife gets very upset, you know?
dialog: She says to her husband, how can
dialog: you be so insensitive? You just
dialog: tell me so abruptly like this?
dialog: Despite his slight Chinese accent, Haiyan's a natural
dialog: storyteller.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Her husband is you know, confused!
dialog: He says to his wife... OK, how do
dialog: you want me to tell you in the
dialog: future? She says, “You have to not
dialog: be so direct. It’s too sudden.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: HAIYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to, you know, be more
dialog: gentle in delivering the news. For
dialog: example, ease me in with something
dialog: like ‘Listen, honey... your cat...
dialog: it got on the roof...’”
text: A few scattered chuckles from the table. JIAN LU, also known
text: as MOM (late 50's), enters with plates of cake.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Oh my gosh, I’m stuffed. I don’t
dialog: know if I have room for dessert.
text: Haiyan is slightly irritated by the interruption.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: Come, sit down...
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Come, Mom.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: Where was I? Oh right... A few
text: months go by. The wife goes out of
text: town again. When she returns home,
text: her husband’s there to greet her
dialog: again. This time, he learned his
text: lesson. When his wife comes through
dialog: the door, he says, "Listen, honey,
dialog: you know, your Mom... she got on
dialog: the roof...”
text: The table bursts into laughter. Even Billi and Jian chuckle,
dialog: despite having heard the joke a million times.
scene_heading: INT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Sound of KEYS in the dark as Billi lets herself in. She’s
text: greeted by a LOUD CRASH - like a vase shattering. Billi drops
text: her mail, suddenly on guard. She’s scared, but ready to
dialog: defend herself.
text: Something FLIES overhead, knocking items off a shelf. Billi’s
text: eyes dart across the room, spotting the culprit.
text: A SMALL HOUSE BIRD on the windowsill. Billi’s eyes meet the
text: bird's. Both parties are equally stunned. As she collects
text: herself, she realizes all the windows are closed.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: How'd you get in here?
text: The bird stares up with its beady eyes. Billi opens a window
text: to let it out. The traumatized bird doesn’t move.
text: Billi’s phone buzzes.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (0.S.)
dialog: (Hi Billi. Sorry I hung up
dialog: earlier. ]
speaker_heading: BILLI

scene_heading: INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT - MORNING
scene_heading: INTERCUT BETWEEN BILLI AND NAI NAI FOR PHONE CONVERSATION
text: MR. LI (80's) shuffles past Nai Nai carrying a THERMOS of
text: tea. Mr. Li is the kind of man that wears the same cap
text: indoors, outdoors, even at weddings.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: (genuine relief)
dialog: (Nothing, nothing. I’m OK. You
dialog: don’t have to worry, child. ]
text: Nai Nai notices the trail of water following Mr. Li.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [It’s leaking! ]
text: He’s oblivious. Nai Nai taps him, then shouts louder.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [It’s leaking! ]
text: Mr. Li shuffles unhurriedly back into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [This old man! So careless! ]
scene_heading: INT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Billi picks her mail off the ground.
speaker_heading: BILLI

speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [I never should've gotten together

speaker_heading: BILLI

speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [It’s OK, he’s going deaf. He can’t

speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: (Why are you still with him?]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: [It’s been so many years. We get
dialog: by. Anyway, it’s better than living
text: alone. At least there’s a live body
dialog: in the house. Otherwise, when you
dialog: get up to go to the bathroom, all
dialog: you see are your own shadows.
dialog: Listen, do you have a friend yet,
dialog: my child? ]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [I um... I have lots of friends.
dialog: Nai Nai...]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [I mean a special friend. I worry
dialog: about you on your own. In a big
dialog: place like New York. ]
scene_heading: INT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - EVENING
text: Billi opens an envelope, pulls out a letter. A rejection from
dialog: the Guggenheim Foundation.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (0.S.)
dialog: (Billi? Is everything OK?]
text: She's deflated, overwhelmed by the sense of failure.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [I’m fine. I’m uh... I’m just
dialog: tired. ]
text: And suddenly, she does seem tired. Spiritually, that is.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [If you're tired, go to bed!]
text: Billi nods to herself, too familiar with the way these things
dialog: get lost in translation.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: OK...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I love you Nai Nai...
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: I lauf you, I lauf you!
text: These are the only words Nai Nai knows. As broken as they
text: sound, she says it with all her heart. Billi summons a weak
text: smile, just in case Nai Nai can hear her smile.
text: She looks back at the windowsill. It's empty. The bird is
dialog: gone.
scene_heading: EXT. BILLI’S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Billi marches out of her apartment holding an ENVELOPE. It’s
text: a new day. She enters the laundromat just downstairs from her
dialog: apartment.
scene_heading: INT. NEIGHBORHOOD LAUNDROMAT - DAY
text: Billi stands across from SHIRLEY (20's), folding stacks of
text: laundry for customers. Her first-generation immigrant mother
text: attends to customers nearby. She is the LAUNDROMAT OWNER (and
dialog: landlord of the building).
speaker_heading: LAUNDROMAT OWNER
dialog: (in another language)
dialog: Late again! She’s always late, and
dialog: she didn’t even pay last month!
text: Billi looks between Shirley and her mother, anxious.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: I wrote a couple pieces for this
dialog: stupid web company and they screwed
dialog: me on the payment, but look it’s
dialog: all here.
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY
dialog: For what month?
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: (confused)
dialog: This one? May?
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY
dialog: And what happened to April’s rent?
dialog: My mom says you didn’t pay April
dialog: yet.
text: Billi is blind-sided as she realizes her error.
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know if you moved out, we could
dialog: double the rent right now?
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD LAUNDROMAT - DAY
text: Billi steps outside, realizes she’s still holding her
dialog: laundry.
scene_heading: INT. WANG FAMILY HOME - DAY
text: Billi bursts through the door carrying the laundry.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Ma! Ba! Hello?
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: Shhh! What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: I've been calling, why didn’t you
dialog: guys pick up?
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: We busy. Have you eaten? I’1l make
dialog: you some wontons.
text: As Jian heads to the kitchen, Billi heads into the laundry
text: room and puts clothes into the washer.
speaker_heading: JIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: So what, you broke? That’s why you
dialog: come. I know you... You need money,
dialog: right?
text: Billi tries to deflect with humor.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: No, I just love an excuse to come
dialog: see you.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: What’s going to happen to you? Are
dialog: you always going to live like this?
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Poor but sexy? I hope so.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: Why you not save? You should change
dialog: your expensive lifestyle!
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Seriously, Mom. If you’re gonna
dialog: give me shit every time I come
dialog: home, I won’t come back anymore!
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: Lower your voice. Dad’s sleeping!
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: It's six o'clock. What’s wrong with
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: JIAN
text: Nothing. He’s just resting.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Is he OK?
text: Jian turns away from Billi and grabs frozen wontons from the
text: freezer. Her body language is evasive.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: He’s fine. We just very busy.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Doing what? What’s going on?
speaker_heading: JIAN
text: (lets out a sigh)
dialog: Hao Hao’s getting married, so we
dialog: have to go to China.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: What? Since when? Didn’t he just
dialog: start dating this girl a few months
dialog: ago?
text: Jian doesn’t respond, intently focused on chopping scallions.
speaker_heading: BILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t go to China right now, Mom.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: You don’t have to go.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: He’s my only cousin, shouldn’t I be
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: No one expects you to go.
dialog: Billi considers this suspiciously.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: You think he knocked her up?
text: Jian silently continues cooking.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: How many wontons you want?
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Um... Five.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: Only five? That's not enough.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Then make a dozen.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: I think ten's good.
text: Billi looks around - the house is eerily quiet. Something's
dialog: not right.
scene_heading: INT. WANG FAMILY HOME, HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Billi stares at the closed door. The light is on inside. She
text: knocks gently and opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. WANG FAMILY HOME, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Haiyan sits on the edge of the bed, facing away from Billi.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Dad?
text: His stillness, his silence - it’s eerie.
speaker_heading: BILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong, Dad?
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Did you and Mom get in a fight?
text: Haiyan fights back tears.
speaker_heading: BILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you been drinking?
text: More silence. Terror.
speaker_heading: BILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you please talk to me? You're
dialog: scaring me.
text: Billi looks up to see Jian at the door.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: BILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: What's going on?
text: More silence. Billi’s insides are shrieking.
speaker_heading: BILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: (raises her voice)
dialog: Something's going on! Just tell me
dialog: what's going on!
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: (dry, to-the-point)
text: Nai Nai's dying. She has lung
dialog: cancer. It's stage four.
text: Billi’s heart drops. She collapses onto the bed, sitting
text: beside her father.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: What? I just spoke to her, she
dialog: didn’t say anything...
speaker_heading: JIAN
text: She doesn’t know yet.
text: Billi’s mind races.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: How long does she have?
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: Doctor says three months, but you
dialog: never know. Could be faster.
dialog: Billi reels.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: I need to call her...
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: No, Billi...
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: I need to see her!
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: You can't do that.
text: Haiyan puts aside his own grief momentarily. His words are
dialog: measured.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: She doesn’t know... And the family
dialog: thinks it’s better not to tell her.
dialog: So you can’t say anything.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: I don’t understand. She needs to
dialog: know, right?
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: There’s nothing they can do, so
dialog: everyone decided it’s better not to
dialog: tell her.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Why is that better?
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: Chinese people have a saying. When
dialog: people get cancer, they die...
dialog: Billi squints - what the fuck?
speaker_heading: JIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: -.. it's not the cancer that kills
dialog: them. It's the fear.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: What about the wedding?
text: Jian joins her family on the bed.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: That was your Dad’s idea. If
text: everyone rushed back to see her
dialog: right now, she would wonder why.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: So you're throwing a fake wedding
dialog: to lie to her?
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: It’s an excuse for everybody to see
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: When were you planning on telling
dialog: me all of this?
text: We're back to silence.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BILLI (CONT'D)
dialog: (accusatory)
dialog: How could you let me find out like
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: How should I have told you? ‘Oh,
dialog: your grandma’s on the roof?
text: This doesn’t get a laugh, but Jian wasn’t expecting one.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: I need to go see her...
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: You can’t.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: Everyone thinks it’s better if you
dialog: don’t go. Look at you. You can’t
dialog: hide your emotions! Nai Nai will
dialog: know right away!
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: I need to say goodbye. What if she
dialog: dies and I don’t get a chance to
dialog: say goodbye?
text: The very thought of this makes Billi break down. Tears stream
text: down her face.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: You can go later. If you go right
dialog: now you’ll give it away. You can’t
dialog: help it.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY, NYC - NIGHT
text: Billi stares out the window, past her own reflection, her
text: grief apparent. Her laundry bag sits beside her.
scene_heading: INT. FRIEND'S HOUSE, BROOKLYN - DAY
text: Lit candles on a birthday cake. Everyone sings ‘happy
text: birthday’ for their friend TONY. Billi’s mind is clearly
text: elsewhere, even as she sings along.
text: Her mother’s right - she’s no good at hiding her emotions.
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. NYC SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT
text: An ELDERLY CHINESE WOMAN waits for her train across the
text: tracks on the opposite platform. As Billi watches her, she
text: fights back emotions.
text: As the train arrives, we see Billi’s grief transform into
text: determination. She knows she must go.
text: As the train whisks the elderly woman away...
scene_heading: INT. CHANGCHUN AIRPORT, CHINA - DAY
text: A sea of Chinese faces. The ceiling is low, the floors are a
text: glossy white marble. It takes a few moments before we spot
text: Billi in the crowd. CHINESE VOICES echo around her.
text: Billi gets shoved into a stranger. As a reflex, Billi says
text: ‘I’m sorry’ in English. The stranger responds with a flurry
text: of Chinese. Billi reacts, trying to orient herself.
scene_heading: EXT. CHANGCHUN AIRPORT, CHINA - DAY
text: A group of TAXI HUSTLERS target Billi, invading her personal
text: space. They inundate her with questions: “Do you need a
dialog: taxi?” “Where are you going?”
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - DAY
text: Billi stares out the window. Construction cranes dot the
text: skyline, wide streets interrupted by the skeletal frames of
text: unfinished buildings.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI, ALLEY - DAY
text: The DRIVER honks repeatedly as he pulls down a narrow alley.
text: Pedestrians and rickshaw peddlers make way for the car to
dialog: pass.
scene_heading: EXT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The taxi pulls up to a complex of PEACH BUILDINGS.
text: Billi gets out. She stares up at the looming building, not
text: sure she’s prepared for the challenge she’s about to face.
scene_heading: INT. NAI NAI'S APARTMENT, STAIRWELL - DAY
text: Billi climbs the stairs. The narrow staircase is dimly lit by
text: a single bulb. She KNOCKS. We immediately hear barking. As
text: Billi waits, the automatic light goes off, leaving her in the
text: dark for a few brief moments.
dialog: 17.
text: Mr. Li opens the door, letting out a shaft of cold
text: fluorescent light from inside the apartment.
speaker_heading: MR. LI
dialog: [Who's that?]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: (Mr. Li? It’s me, Billi.]
speaker_heading: MR. LI
dialog: [Who? ]
text: Mr. Li shouts his words, as one does when they’re losing
dialog: their hearing, and perhaps even their mind.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Billi!
speaker_heading: MR. LI
dialog: (Billi? What are you doing here?
dialog: Come in, come in!]
speaker_heading: BILLI

dialog: [Nai Nai?]
scene_heading: INT. NAI NAI’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: As Billi moves into the living room, everyone reacts. Nai
dialog: Nai, Haiyan, Jian.
text: There’s also UNCLE HAIBIN (early 60's), distinguished grey
text: with black-rimmed glasses. AUNTIE LING (60), quiet but
dialog: shrewd.
text: The pimple-faced and sheepish cousin is HAO HAO (early 20's);
text: ‘on the brink of tears’ is his eternal state of being. AIKO
text: is his sweet but confused Japanese bride.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI

speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: Why'd you come?
speaker_heading: LITTLE NAI NAI
dialog: [What are you doing here? We all

speaker_heading: JIAN

speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: (Billi! Billi! What are you doing
dialog: here you stupid child?]
text: Nai Nai approaches Billi, analyzing her.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [Let me look at you. Oh you’re not
dialog: that skinny! Your Mom said you got
dialog: skinny, but you’re not that
dialog: skinny! ]
text: Nai Nai embraces Billi. Billi’s throat swells shut. Her mouth
text: quivers as tears flood to her eyes.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [Oh my granddaughter! Why didn’t
dialog: you tell me you were coming? I've
dialog: been trying to call you all week! ]
text: A deer in headlights, Billi doesn’t speak, as if the secret
text: would spill out if she opened her mouth. Family members
text: observe her carefully, exchanging looks of concern.
text: Nai Nai kisses her all over her face. Billi fights for
dialog: control of her emotions.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [Your mother said you were too busy
dialog: to come! ]
text: Billi opens her mouth and still, nothing comes out.

speaker_heading: HAIYAN

speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: I’m fine.
text: Before Billi can continue, Gu Gu approaches, also in pajamas.
text: She's accompanied by a MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST.
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [All set, let’s go.]
scene_heading: INT. MASSAGE PARLOR, HALLWAY - DAY
text: Billi, Gu Gu and Haiyan walk down the hallway.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: [Sis, you’re too generous. ]
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [You’re family. It’s so rare for

scene_heading: MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST
dialog: [What kind of treatment would you
dialog: like, ‘mei nu’?]
text: Gu Gu clocks Billi’s confusion.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [She’s from America. Her Chinese
dialog: isn’t great. Just give her the full
dialog: body massage. ]
scene_heading: MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST
dialog: [Cupping too?]
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [The whole package. ]
scene_heading: MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST
dialog: [You want the same thing, ‘mei
dialog: nu’?]
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [I don’t need cupping. ]
text: Gu Gu speaks too fast for Billi to understand. She turns to
dialog: her father for a translation -
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: What’s ‘mei nu’?
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: It means ‘beauty’.
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [Always beauty, beauty. They call
dialog: everyone that in China these days.
dialog: Old or young, beautiful or ugly,
dialog: everyone’s a beauty! It’s so
dialog: stupid. ]
text: The MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST turns to Haiyan.
scene_heading: MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST
dialog: [Sir, what about you?]
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: (jokes )
dialog: [Oh you can call me beauty. I don’t
dialog: mind. ]
scene_heading: MASSAGE PARLOR RECEPTIONIST
dialog: (doesn’t crack a smile)
dialog: [I meant what kind of treatment
dialog: would you like, sir? May I
dialog: recommend our bath and massage
text: package? The tub is filled with
dialog: herbs and you can soak in it.]
text: Gu Gu and Billi watch Haiyan. He's indecisive.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: (to Gu Gu)
dialog: [What do you think?]
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [Why are you asking me? It's your
dialog: massage! Do you want to soak in a
dialog: tub? ]
text: Haiyan contemplates this carefully, as if the right treatment
dialog: might cure his grief.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: [Can you show me the tub?]
text: The receptionist leads Haiyan down the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. MASSAGE PARLOR, MASSAGE ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: You don't know this phrase? You're

dialog: you this stuff.]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: What’s it mean?]
dialog: 
text: Gu Gu covertly demonstrates a jerking-off motion, giggling.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [You know, it shoots so high he
dialog: could hit an airplane! ]
text: Despite herself, Billi laughs. Haiyan appears at the doorway.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: [The bath looks nice. I think I'll
dialog: do that.]
text: Billi and Gu Gu burst out laughing.
speaker_heading: HAIYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: INT. MASSAGE PARLOR, MASSAGE ROOM - LATER
text: Lying on her stomach, Billi stares down at the masseuse's
text: feet in nylon stockings inside white pumps. She cringes as
text: the masseuse lights a cup on fire and places it on her back.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [It hurts! Gu Gu, you said it was a
dialog: massage. ]
speaker_heading: BILLI’S MASSEUSE
dialog: [A little pain is normal. Otherwise
dialog: it doesn’t work. Just relax. ]
text: Billi turns to Gu Gu, who’s absorbed in her cell phone while
text: getting a foot massage.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [Gu Gu... Don’t you think we should
dialog: tell Nai Nai?]
text: Gu Gu’s attention stays on her phone.
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [Tell her? What for?]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [What if she has things she wants
dialog: to take care of?]
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: (matter-of-factly)
dialog: [She doesn’t have anything like
dialog: that... Ow!]
text: Gu Gu yanks her foot back from the masseuse.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: GU GU (CONT'D)
dialog: (That hurt, what was that?]
speaker_heading: GU GU’S MASSEUSE
dialog: [That’s your stress point. Have you
dialog: been anxious lately? You must try
dialog: to relax. ]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [But... what if she wants to say
dialog: goodbye? ]
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [Say goodbye? That’s so painful!
dialog: What’s the point of that?]
text: Billi winces with pain, her entire back covered with cups. Gu
text: Gu seems very pragmatic and matter-of-fact.
speaker_heading: GU GU (CONT'D)
dialog: [You see her for yourself. She
dialog: seems fine, right? Just like a
dialog: normal person...]
text: Billi realizes this is valid.
speaker_heading: GU GU (CONT'D)
dialog: [If you tell her, you’1l ruin her
dialog: good mood. ]
dialog: Billi considers this.
scene_heading: INT. WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, SETUP 1 - DAY
text: Aiko and Hao Hao pose in front of a backdrop, dressed in
text: elaborate wedding attire. They're as stiff as the plastic
text: bride and groom toppers on a cake.
text: A PHOTOGRAPHER adjusts the couple's positions.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: [Get a little closer. Even closer. ]
text: The cake toppers don’t know where to put their hands. It’s
text: all very forced and awkward.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [Get closer! What's wrong with this
dialog: girl? Can't you look like a normal
dialog: couple in love?]

speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [Put your head on his shoulder. Put
dialog: your hand around her. And smile! ]
text: Aiko looks to Hao Hao for a translation, but he’s too busy
text: figuring out how to smile. Nai Nai directs her disapproving
dialog: look to Billi.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [That girl is so unaffectionate.
dialog: Nothing like our family. I have to
dialog: yell at her just to hug him or put

dialog: wonder what they do in the bedroom
dialog: when I'm not there! ]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [She seems really sweet, Nai Nai.]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [I don’t like her. She’s dumb. She
dialog: doesn’t understand anything! ]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [She doesn’t understand, because
dialog: she doesn’t speak Chinese...]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [No, it’s because she’s dumb. ]
text: On cue, something on set falls, making Aiko trip. Everyone
dialog: reacts.
text: Against the chaos of the photo shoot, Nai Nai calmly shifts
text: her attention to her granddaughter. Billi is clearly the
dialog: better bride in her eyes - if only she’d find someone to
dialog: marry.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [Look at you. Smart. Beautiful. You
dialog: should have someone take care of
dialog: you. ]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [I take care of myself, Nai Nai.]
scene_heading: INT. WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, SETUP 2 - DAY
text: The conversation is seamless, but in the background, the
text: bride and groom pose against a different backdrop.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [You’re still young. But as you get
dialog: older, it’s good for you to have
dialog: someone to take care of you.]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [Does Mr. Li take care of you?]
text: Nai Nai looks away. She takes a beat before answering.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [It’s also good to be independent.
dialog: A woman needs to be self-
dialog: sufficient. ]
text: The woman’s got a response to everything. Billi laughs as Nai
text: Nai presses her cheek against Billi’s.
text: Meanwhile, on set, Aiko stumbles in her impossibly high heels
text: and Auntie Ling rushes to her assistance.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [Stupid child. You are too lovable.
dialog: I’ll never forget when your parents
dialog: brought you to my house the summer
dialog: before you turned two. You were so
dialog: small, so skinny. You had that
dialog: horrible nanny who stole your eggs
dialog: and she’d take you all over the
dialog: city and only feed you popsicles.
dialog: Do you remember this?]
text: Billi shakes her head.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [Why did she steal my eggs?]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [Eggs were rationed back then. Your
dialog: parents saved theirs so you could
dialog: have at least one a day.]
scene_heading: INT. WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, SETUP 3 - DAY
dialog: Billi considers this sacrifice, internalizing the complicated
text: mix of love and guilt.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [You poor thing, I felt so bad for
dialog: you. You had terrible digestion,
dialog: from too much dampness trapped
dialog: inside, so you’d have diarrhea all
dialog: the time, everywhere... all over
dialog: the floor. ]
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [I’m sorry I pooped on your floor. ]
text: And she does seem sorry. Behind her, the young couple hold up
text: flutes of fake champagne for a photo.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [It wasn’t your fault! I told your
dialog: mother to leave you with me so I
dialog: could fix you. Spending that year
dialog: with me, you became fatter, the
dialog: color returned to your cheeks. ]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [You fixed me! ]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [You were just a happy child.
dialog: Everyone loved you. You were so
dialog: open, always smiling. My child,
dialog: there’s been so much going on this
dialog: trip, we haven’t been able to talk
dialog: much. ]
text: On cue again, a LOST BRIDE waddles onto set from a back door.
text: Suddenly, there are two brides against the backdrop, causing
text: momentary confusion. The BRIDE HANDLER immediately pulls her
text: back out, apologizing.
text: Nai Nai is unfazed by all this, her attention fixed on Billi.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [This event is very important.
dialog: There will be a lot of relatives
dialog: and friends who haven’t seen you
dialog: since you were little. I know you

dialog: Be courteous! ]
scene_heading: INT. WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO, SETUP 4 - DAY

speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [When you see people, you should
dialog: loudly say 'hello auntie! Hello

speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: ['Nio nio ne ne?’]
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [You don't know ‘nio nio ne ne’?
dialog: You know... like this...]
text: Nai Nai demonstrates the phrase comically. Billi chuckles.
speaker_heading: NAI NAI (CONT'D)
dialog: [That's 'nio nio ne ne'. Very

speaker_heading: BILLI

speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [Come, let’s toast. Welcome home,

speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: [Sis, thank you for everything...]

speaker_heading: GU FU
dialog: [We're all one family. No need to

speaker_heading: SUN AO

speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [My dad quit.]
speaker_heading: UNCLE HAIBIN
dialog: [Really?]

speaker_heading: UNCLE HAIBIN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Billi)
dialog: [I don’t think so. I think he just

text: Sun Ao sees that Nai Nai didn’t finish her beer.
speaker_heading: SUN AO

speaker_heading: NICO
dialog: [Hey Billi, you ever think about

speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: (Um... a long time. ]
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [Really? It’s very easy in China. ]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: [Money is not the most important.

speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [Look at my granddaughter! She’s so
dialog: wise! ]
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [But if you get rich, first you buy

text: Jian is triggered by this.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: [YuPing, if you can get rich in

dialog: send Bao to America for college?]
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: [For more opportunity...]
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: [What kind of opportunity? Money-
dialog: making opportunity? After studying
dialog: in America, maybe Bao also won't
dialog: care about money. Just like Billi.
dialog: She's got different values. ]
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Mom, can you not talk about me?
speaker_heading: GU GU
dialog: (trying to make peace)
dialog: [You guys don’t have to worry. When

speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: [So raising a kid is like playing

speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: (to Dad)
dialog: What’s that mean?
speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: They're saying you’re a stock
dialog: investment and you'll make us rich.
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: But I can’t expect that from you,

speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: [These American kids are only

speaker_heading: SUN AO
dialog: [Nowadays, Chinese kids are that
dialog: way too!]
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: [But in America, they actually have

speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: You're kidding right? You think
dialog: everyone in America has equal
dialog: opportunity?
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: [You know, the first year we moved
dialog: to America, our friend Henry
dialog: introduced us to an American
dialog: church. The first time we went, we
dialog: were really nervous, didn’t
dialog: understand anything. After the
dialog: service, we walked past the piano
text: and Billi stood in front of it,
text: staring. She reached her hand out
dialog: and Haiyan stopped her. The pastor
text: came over to introduce herself.
dialog: Haiyan explained to the pastor that
dialog: Billi used to study piano in China.
dialog: She stopped after we moved and
dialog: really missed it. We couldn't
dialog: afford it. The pastor didn’t say
dialog: anything, but came back moments
dialog: later and handed me a key. She
dialog: said, “This key opens every door on
dialog: this property. Come anytime and
dialog: Billi can play the piano.”]
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [Really? They really did that?]
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: [I didn’t speak English so I

speaker_heading: HAIYAN
dialog: [They even got her a piano teacher
dialog: for free. ]
speaker_heading: LITTLE NAI NAI
dialog: [Look at that. That would never

speaker_heading: NICO
dialog: [But China has China’s benefits!

speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: [Yea, the roast duck is still
dialog: delicious! ]
text: Jian’s the only one laughing at her own joke again.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Mom. That one church is not

dialog: We have so many problems -
dialog: healthcare, guns, public
dialog: education...
speaker_heading: JIAN
dialog: (suddenly defensive)
dialog: If you think China’s better, then
dialog: why don’t you move here?
speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [That’s enough. You listen to me!

speaker_heading: JIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: But even with the risk that he

speaker_heading: BILLI

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BEST, BILLI’S ROOM - MORNING
text: Billi wakes to voices echoing through the hallway. She opens

speaker_heading: NAI NAI
dialog: [I have this lingering cough from

dialog: but it didn’t feel like a good
dialog: thing when you and Dad fought all
dialog: the time because we didn’t have
dialog: money and I was the weird Chinese
dialog: girl in school who didn’t speak
dialog: English and had no friends or
dialog: anyone to talk to. I wanted to
dialog: believe that it was a good thing,
