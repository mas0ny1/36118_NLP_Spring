text: AND SOME "OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS
scene_heading: SOFT COPY.
scene_heading: EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST - DAY
scene_heading: BEGIN TITLES OVER:
text: It is early morning and already hot. INSECTS drone, crackle,
text: and scurry for shade. PRAIRIE DOGS burrow to escape the sun.
text: We can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the Earth.
text: On a dusty highway, a pair of VULTURES dine on a dead coyote.
text: One of them snags an intestine and tugs a few feet of it out of
text: the carcass.
text: In the distance, where a long, dusty road meets the horizon, a
text: small shape appears -- a Sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang
text: convertible, its top down. Its candy-apple red burns like a
text: brilliant fireball under the sun. As the car drifts closer, we
text: see steam escaping from under the hood. Sammi Smith's "Please
text: Help Me Get Through The Night" plays on the car's radio.
scene_heading: INT. BOBBY COOPER'S MUSTANG - DAY
text: At the wheel, ignoring impending disaster, BOBBY COOPER, young,
text: good-looking, fiddles with the RADIO dial, annoyed only to find
dialog: country stations. He's been driving since noon yesterday and it
text: shows -- along with a heavily-bandaged left hand resting on the
text: steering wheel. He finds something by Pearl Jam or Smashing
text: Pumpkins and he cranks it. He pops a Percodan with his good hand
text: as, in the shimmering distance ahead, he sees black shapes in
text: the road and lays on the horn.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Get off the goddamn road!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY
text: As the MUSTANG powers by, the VULTURES move off the shoulder,
text: silently watching.
scene_heading: INT. MUSTANG - DAY
text: The RADIO blares as BOBBY fights to stay awake. His attention is
text: caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane. He
text: sits up as the POLICE CAR (SHERIFF POTTER inside) closes
text: quickly. The SIREN starts faintly, then SCREAMS as the cruiser
text: roars past at speed.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Fuck you!
text: There is a loud pop from the front of the Mustang and a thick
text: cloud of steam now pours from the hood. The temperature gauge
text: now starts rising.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No!...Not now!...Shit!
text: A couple of SEMIS roar past in the opposite direction,
text: buffetting the Mustang with their air waves.
scene_heading: EXT. FORK IN THE ROAD - DAY
text: The car rolls into a fork in the road, limping with the droop of
text: an animal that won't make another hundred yards.
text: One sign on the larger road says "GLOBE" is 29 miles away. The
text: other sign, on the lesser road, tells us "SUPERIOR" is only 2
text: miles. A third sign confirms his destiny with "Gas, Food, 1
dialog: Mile."
text: BOBBY seems to have no choice. He aims the car down the lesser
dialog: road towards "Superior, Arizona."
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSKIRTS SUPERIOR - DAY
text: The car rattles on its last legs, as BOBBY mutters incantations,
text: noticing a old, ghostlike MINING COMPANY at the base of the
text: mountains overlooking the TOWN. It's deserted now, no one
text: visible, the gates shut, but in its vast, dark bulk, we sense
text: the ancient richness and power of this town. Bobby moves on.
scene_heading: EXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - DAY
text: Down the road from the MINING COMPANY, BOBBY'S CAR pulls into a
text: small GAS STATION, made of weather-beaten wood, its windows long
text: since dusted over. The pumps themselves look to have been
text: manufactured in the early fifties. Above the station is a sign
text: so faded it's barely readable: HARLIN'S.
text: Bobby gets out of the car and with great care, favoring his
text: bandaged left hand which seems to give him a great deal of pain,
text: he opens the hood. A plume of steam hits him in the face.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh shit!
text: Bobby looks around for someone, anyone. After a few moments he
text: reaches into the car and blows the horn. He waits, then blows
text: it again. From out of the station walks DARRELL - a
text: slow-looking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty. He
text: looks the part of a yokel.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You Harlin?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Nope. Darrell.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Harlin around?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
text: He's up at the Look Out.
text: Darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Will he be back soon?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a
dialog: cemetery.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You own this place?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Then why do you call it Harlin's?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: 'Cause Harlin used to own it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: But he's dead.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: So?
text: Bobby is confused, but chooses to drop the matter.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You want to take a look at my car? I think
dialog: the radiator hose is--
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Damn. Gonna be another hot one today.
dialog: Sometimes I don't even want to get out of
dialog: bed. Course don't want to get out for the
dialog: cold one's neither. Then of course the
text: clouds come in...
text: Darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag. It doesn't so much
text: wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Darrell--
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look
text: at my radiator hose. It's busted.
text: Darrell is clearly upset at being cut off. He leans into the
text: car and looks at the engine.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: It's your radiator hose. It's busted.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I know it's busted. What did I just tell
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Well, you know so much why don't you just
dialog: fix it yourself?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: If I could do you think I'd be standing
dialog: here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or
dialog: do I have to go somewhere else?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Somewhere else? Mister, somewhere else is
dialog: fifty miles from here. Only other gas
dialog: station down in town closed 3 years ago
dialog: when the mine got shut...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you
dialog: fix it, or not?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Yeah, I can fix it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Great!
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can
dialog: find a hose like this one, or close enough.
dialog: Gonna take time.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: How much time?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Time.
text: BOBBY (rewinds his watch)
dialog: What time is it now?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
text: Twenty-after-ten.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be
dialog: ninety already.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Ninety-two. Course half hour from now
text: might be seventy-two. These clouds move
text: around a lot.
text: Bobby wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: What happened to your hand?
text: Self-consciously Bobby quickly drops his hand to his side.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Accident.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: You got to be more careful. Hands is
dialog: important. Let me show you something. When
dialog: I was a kid, now I don't know if you can
text: still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a
dialog: lawnmower.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm very interested in this but is there
dialog: someplace...
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Diner up a piece. Not much, but us simple
dialog: folk like it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be
dialog: careful with her, will you?
text: Darrell slams down the hood.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
text: Just a car.
text: Bobby reaches into the car, pulls out a small ugly gym bag which
text: he slings onto his shoulder and moves to the trunk, pops it open.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: It's not just a car. It's a sixty-four and
dialog: half Mustang convertible. That's the
dialog: difference between you and me, and why you
dialog: live here and I'm just passing through.
text: The trunk lid rises in the air, partially blocking Bobby from
text: Darrell, acting as a partition between them.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff
text: out of the trunk.
text: He throws the car key to Darrell who takes the hint, spits
text: grotesquely into the dirt, scratches his nuts, and walks back
text: to the shack.
text: Concealed by the trunk lid, Bobby pulls out a GUN (a .9mm black
text: Baretta), wrapped in a t-shirt, from the top of the bag. Perhaps
text: we see a flash of green money, lots of it. Sports pages and
text: betting sheets are piled inside. With a look around, Bobby takes
text: the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk.
text: Briefly we notice a towing ROPE under the mat. There is a small
text: travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percodan,
text: quickly taking two, as well as the sports page.
scene_heading: INT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - DAY
text: DARRELL watches out of the darkened office through the front
text: window, as BOBBY slams the trunk and starts walking down the
text: road, with the bag on his shoulder.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - LATER
text: BOBBY walks along a dusty patch of road into town past a sign
scene_heading: saying "SUPERIOR - HOME OF THE GOLDEN DOOR RETIREMENT
text: COMMUNITY." As he walks on, a pair of MOTORCYCLERS roar past on
text: their Harleys blanketing him in a cloud of DUST. He shouts
text: after them, but his words are lost under the whine of the cycle
dialog: engines.
scene_heading: EXT. SUPERIOR MAIN STREET - DAY
text: BOBBY hits town, such as it is: The Freeway left here a few
dialog: years back. There are only a few little stores: A general
text: store, a catalog outlet, a post office that doubles as a bus
text: depot. All of them built for the desert heat. The busiest spot
text: in town seems to be the truckstop/diner with a few 18 wheelers
text: parked outside it.
text: At the corner of one street sits an old BLIND MAN dressed in
text: raggedy clothes, perhaps an Indian. His SEEING-EYE DOG lies next
text: to him. He's talking to TWO OLD MEN, veterans perhaps, Indian or
text: Spanish. They both have missing limbs and slide off with furtive
text: alcoholic looks as Bobby passes. The Blind Man yells out in an
dialog: American Indian accent.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Hey! You there!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You want something, old man?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Don't call me old man. Ain't you got
dialog: no respect, boy?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You want something?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Yeah I want something. I want you to run
dialog: over to that machine and get me a pop.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You can't do that yourself?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm
dialog: blind. Can't you see that?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm sorry, I didn't--
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: What'd you think I was doing out here
dialog: with these glasses on? Sunnin' myself?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't know. I thought you were keeping
dialog: the sun out of your eyes.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: I ain't got no eyes. You want to see?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Christ no!
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam. Lost them
dialog: fighting the commies. Fought the war and
dialog: lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so
dialog: you can come around here and make fun of
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I said I was sorry.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Don't be sorry. Just run over there and
dialog: get me my pop before I die of thirst.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, sure. You got change?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Change? You want my change? I fought the
dialog: war and lost my eyes just so I could give
dialog: you my change?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: All right, old man. Christ.
text: Bobby walks across the street to a very old soda machine; it has
text: bottles instead of cans. The blind man shouts to Bobby.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Get me a Dr. Peppa! I don't want no Colas.
dialog: Colas ain't nothing but flavored water.
text: Bobby puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of Dr.
text: Pepper. He starts back to the blind man.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Don't forget to open it for me. I can't be
dialog: opening my own bottle.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Christ!
text: Bobby goes back to the machine and opens the bottle, then walks
text: back to the old man who pours a splash on the ground.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: A little for Mother Earth. I'm about fifty
dialog: percent Indian, you know. To all our
dialog: relations.
text: He takes a hearty swig of the soda.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Ah! Just what I needed! Want some?
text: The blind man holds the bottle out to Bobby. A string of saliva
text: runs from his lips to the bottle's neck.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'll pass.
text: Bobby reaches down and pets the old man's dog. Flies buzz around
text: both the dog and the Blind Man.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.
text: He looks sick.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: That's 'cause he's dead.
text: Bobby jumps back.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh, Jesus.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What the hell are you keeping a dead dog
dialog: around for?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: He's only just dead. What was I supposed
dialog: to do with him? I can't take him away
dialog: anywhere. And nobody wants to take him for
dialog: me. Do you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hell no!
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: See. Ain't nothing I can do but keep him
dialog: here beside me. That's where he belongs
dialog: anyways. Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not
dialog: anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals
dialog: since the war when I lost my eyes. He was
dialog: just a pup then... a companion that's
dialog: loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no
dialog: matter how much you kick him...I miss him.
dialog: (as Bobby moves away) I'll see ya later,
dialog: unless I come across something worse.
text: Bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street, GRACE McKENNA,
text: compulsively turns and catches up to her. She is dressed better
text: than the usual t-shirts and tank tops of this town -- perhaps a
text: mail-ordered dress or a mother's hand-me-down. With her raven
text: hair and caramel skin, it is obvious she is Native American. Her
text: arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm just going to my car?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's right on my way.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: My mother told me never to accept offers
dialog: from strangers.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: My name is Bobby. Now I'm not a stranger
dialog: anymore. See how easy it is for us to get
dialog: to know each other, beautiful?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Do you have to call me that?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't know your real name.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Maybe I don't want you to.
text: Grace stops walking.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would
dialog: have kept on walking.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I like that about me, beautiful.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's Grace.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: May I carry your package, Grace?
text: Grace hesitates, then gives the package to Bobby. He has
dialog: trouble with it himself.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You sure you can manage?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I got it.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
text: Bobby blurts out emphatically.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No!
text: He catches himself, and softens a bit.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, I've got it.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What happened to your hand?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Accident.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You should be more careful.
text: They start walking towards Grace's car.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's very nice of you to help me. That
text: package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No trouble at all, really.
text: They get to a car and Bobby puts down the package.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Wasn't nothing.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh, this isn't my car. It's down a ways.
dialog: I should have parked closer. I just didn't
dialog: think it would be so heavy. I could drive
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's all right. I got it.
text: Bobby takes up the package and they begin walking again. The
text: package seems to have gained weight.
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: It's just new drapes and curtain rods. If
dialog: I had known it was going to be so heavy I
dialog: would have had them delivered up to the
dialog: house.
text: Bobby struggles with the package. Sweat starts to sheet his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (panting)
dialog: That a fact?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I just got tired of looking at the old
dialog: drapes. My mother made them. Had them long
dialog: as I can remember. You ever seen something
dialog: and just knew you had to have it?
speaker_heading: BOBBY (straining)
dialog: Yes, I have.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: 'Course they cost a little more than I
dialog: should really be spending. But, damn it, I
dialog: don't hardly ever do anything nice for
dialog: myself. I deserve nice things.
dialog: BOBBY (can hardly talk)
dialog: I ... can't ... argue ...
text: They arrive at a JEEP SAHARA.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: This is it.
text: Bobby practically drops the package. He is covered with sweat.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Thank you, Bobby.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You're welcome, Grace.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You're not from around here, are you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Why you say that? Just because I help a
dialog: lady with her package?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You don't have that dead look in your eyes
dialog: like the only thing you live for is to get
dialog: through the day.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I just drove in this morning.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Drove into Superior? What for?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Didn't have a choice. My car overheated up
dialog: the road.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You're lucky you didn't break down in the
dialog: desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no
dialog: time. When you leaving?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Not until my car's fixed. I don't know how
dialog: long that's going to take.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
text: Grace steps to Bobby and places her hand against his chest. She
text: rubs away some of the sweat. They look at each other a beat. A
text: POLICE CAR, seen earlier, pulls up beside them from behind and
text: idles. SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER is a weathered, handsome,
text: middle-aged man with suspicious eyes, black haired in contrast
text: to Bobby's sandiness.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Morning Grace.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Well it's about time. Looks like you found
dialog: yourself a helper too.
text: Bobby wants to shrink behind the drapes.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Well, he offered, and I just couldn't
text: refuse. His car overheated.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Oh?
text: Bobby turns to the Sheriff and forces a smile.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Morning, officer.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Son.
dialog: (beat, to Grace)
dialog: Little excitement out at the reservation
dialog: this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were
text: up drinking all night and then Wayne starts
text: chasing Dale around the desert with his
dialog: shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for
dialog: backup.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Anybody hurt?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's
text: sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he
dialog: didn't kill his own danged self.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting
dialog: you, son.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Same here, officer.
text: The Sheriff drives on. Pause. They look at each other.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Well, I guess I could use some help
dialog: getting this box into the house. Not far.
dialog: You could shower, get something cool to
dialog: drink.
text: Bobby considers the offer, but there's not much considering to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, I could use something cool.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY
text: BOBBY rides along with GRACE in her JEEP.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Where you coming from?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just
dialog: lately Dallas.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You've been around.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I guess I've got wander in my blood.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Where you headed?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't know. I have to make a stop in
dialog: Vegas. Business to finish. Then maybe
dialog: I'll head to Santa Barbara. I might be
text: able to pick up some action there.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: So, what is it you do, Mister...?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever
dialog: pays best. Little bartending, used to teach
dialog: tennis, played a little competition ...
dialog: (drops it).
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I never played tennis. You just travel
dialog: around Bobby-- no direction, no steady
dialog: work. You must like taking chances.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: If you're going to gamble, might as well
dialog: play for high stakes.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What happens when you lose?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I pack up and go somewhere else.
dialog: GRACE (wistfully)
dialog: Somewhere else. I've never been anywhere
dialog: else. Just once. Years ago. Went to the
dialog: State Fair. It was nice, but it wasn't
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I couldn't stay in this place. I wouldn't.
dialog: I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do,
dialog: and get out.
text: Grace looks to Bobby and smiles.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Sometimes I feel the exact same way.
scene_heading: INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - LATER - DAY
text: BOBBY, naked, steps into the shower and turns on the water. It
text: shoots from the shower head and cascades over his body. As the
text: water falls over him we hear a Russian accented voice:
speaker_heading: VOICE(V.O.)
dialog: I want my money.
text: Bobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady
text: himself. His hand is curled in such a way we cannot see his
text: pinky or ring finger. Bobby leans back in the shower. Just as
dialog: he does:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
text: It is raining hard. Matching the backwards motion of the last
text: scene BOBBY is thrown violently against a brick wall, facing
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: VOICE(V.O.)
dialog: I want my money.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Look, I'll get the money! You don't want to
dialog: do this!
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Take two for now. One a week, punk...
text: Bobby is being pressed against the wall by two muscular GOONS.
text: Another MAN stands partially hidden behind the goon's frame.
text: With one hand one goon flattens Bobby's hand against the brick,
text: with his other he clips two fingers off with a GARDEN SHEAR. We
text: see Bobby's face in agonizing pain, then he slides screaming to
text: the ground until he is framed between the legs of the men.
text: As Bobby clutches his left hand the rainwater runs in streaks
text: down his ashen, blank face.
scene_heading: INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: We see BOBBY's face reliving the experience as once again we
text: hear the voice.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Two weeks, asshole. Get the money or you
dialog: gonna lose your nose and ears.
text: Bobby has slumped to the floor of the shower, looking to his
text: left hand, almost crying, unable to tolerate it. As a streak of
text: blood snakes down the white tile we see that the pinky and ring
text: FINGERS have been cut off at the joints.
scene_heading: INT. GRACE'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - DAY
text: BOBBY, his hand rebandaged, is putting on his clothes.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (to himself)
dialog: You're still lucky.
text: As he does he looks at himself in the mirror. He bends to pick
text: up his shirt which is draped over the gym bag. As he lifts it we
text: can see, perhaps more closely than at the garage, that the bag is
text: 3/4 filled with money. He closes the bag and stands. In the
text: MIRROR, hidden in the doorway, he sees GRACE watching him. Bobby
text: slows perceptibly, but does not try to hide himself. After a
text: moment Grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Thought you might like a refill on your lemonade.
text: Bobby takes the lemonade and drinks it down. He rubs the glass
text: against his forehead.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's good. Cools you right off.
dialog: (tentatively) I saw you watching me.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I didn't say it bothered me.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Did you like it; me watching you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I guess. I've got an ego same as any man.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
text: Bobby gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant. Grace slides
text: an ice cube from the glass between her lips. He notices a framed
text: picture of GRACE and an OLDER MAN.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nice place.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Thank you.
text: Grace sits on the edge of the bed. Bobby indicates the picture,
dialog: ironic.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Who's that, your father?
speaker_heading: GRACE (without much thought)
dialog: Stepfather...
speaker_heading: BOBBY (coy)
dialog: Got a boyfriend?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No. Not really.
text: Bobby senses she's lying but plays along.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Must get kind of lonely for a woman living
text: by herself in a big house.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I guess it must.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What do you do anyway?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: A little of this, a little of that. Mostly
dialog: I tell fortunes.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Where'd you learn to do that?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: From my father. He was the tribe's shaman.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: A medicine man?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Those are white words, not ours.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nice house for a shaman's daughter. You
dialog: must be good.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Come here.
text: Bobby goes to Grace and kneels before her. She takes his head
text: in her hands and looks deep into his eyes. Her voice goes
text: thick, but soft, like a morning fog.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: There's something in your past; something
dialog: you want to keep hidden. There's a pain.
dialog: Something ... someone you can't forget.
dialog: And there is something you want very badly.
dialog: It seems very far away to you, but you are
dialog: determined, and you will do what you must
dialog: to get it.
text: Bobby closes his hands on Grace's and takes them from his face.
text: He is more than slightly spooked by the accuracy of Grace's
dialog: reading.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: My face tell you all that?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It tells me what every face tells me.
dialog: Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and
dialog: they have something they want.
dialog: (seductively) What is it you want?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: The same thing you do.
text: They silently stare into each other's eyes.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Really? I want to hang drapes.
text: Grace walks from the room. For a moment Bobby stares after her.
text: He takes an ice cube from his glass and crunches it in his
dialog: teeth.
scene_heading: INT. GRACE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: GRACE is standing on a step ladder trying to hang the drapes.
text: BOBBY notices a photo of Grace with an older INDIAN WOMAN, her
dialog: mother?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Hold me.
text: Bobby stands behind her, gently places his hands on Grace's
dialog: waist.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Tighter. I won't break. You know girls are
dialog: a lot tougher than men think.
text: Bobby holds her tighter as she finished hanging the drapes. His
text: eyes are transfixed on her ass.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: There. All done. Lift me down.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Lift me down.
text: Bobby lifts Grace down from the ladder. He holds her, his hands
text: around her waist.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You can let go of me now. I'm safe.(with
dialog: a wicked smile) How do they look?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Like you.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Beautiful?
speaker_heading: BOBBY (kidding)
text: Like they're made of polyester.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I like them. I was sick of looking at this
dialog: room. I think they add a little life.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nothing like a little liveliness.
text: With a sexy pout Grace loads the next question.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No more drapes to hang. Now what should
dialog: we do?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I have an idea.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: And what would that be?
text: Bobby steps close to Grace and takes her by the shoulders. He
text: pulls her to him and presses his lips hard to hers. Grace
text: doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: All right, Grace. No more games.
speaker_heading: GRACE (innocently)
dialog: Games?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You flirt with me, then you run cold. You
dialog: lead me on, then slap me down. I don't go
dialog: for being jerked around.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Really? And what game did you want to
dialog: play? You carry my box for me, and I fall
dialog: into bed with you?
text: Bobby grabs up his pack.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I think I can find my own way back to
dialog: into town.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Maybe I like to find out about a man first.
dialog: Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a
dialog: few memories of bad women; just like most
dialog: guys. But you already know that. You read
dialog: my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
text: Bobby turns to leave.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You never did answer my question.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Still playing?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: That's not an answer. What is it you want?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You know what I want.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
text: For a beat Bobby stands and stares hard at Grace. His pack
text: slides from his shoulder and thuds on the floor. With great
text: determination, like a beast closing for the kill, Bobby moves
text: for her. Grace stands firm, ready for him; her head tilts back.
text: Her breath comes deep and hard.
text: Just as Bobby is about to reach her, just as he is about to take
text: her, he is stopped dead by the booming voice of JAKE McKENNA.
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: Grace!
text: Bobby turns to face Jake: An older man, still large and
dialog: formidable for his age.
speaker_heading: GRACE (nonplussed)
dialog: Jake. I thought you...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Who the hell is this!?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm her husband.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (shocked whisper)
dialog: Husband ...?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Now who the hell are you, and it better be
dialog: good, or God help me I'll break you in
dialog: half.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife.
dialog: I met her in town. She needed a hand with
text: her drapes. That's all.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Didn't much look like you were hanging
text: drapes.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I swear to you that's all that happened. I
dialog: haven't so much as set foot in your
dialog: bedroom.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: A lot that means.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Grace, tell him.
text: Grace says nothing. She picks up a glass of lemonade and sips
text: at it coolly.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Damn it, Grace! Tell him.
speaker_heading: GRACE (coyly)
dialog: If he says that's what happened, Jake, it
dialog: must be true.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh yeah, and I suppose you didn't have
dialog: anything to do with it Grace, he just
dialog: wandered up here by hisself. I got a mind
dialog: to put you over my knee and paddle your
dialog: ass raw!
speaker_heading: BOBBY (to Grace)
dialog: You bitch! Is this what it's all about? You
dialog: sucker me up here so you can watch the two
dialog: of us beat the shit out of each other over
dialog: you? You both... Forget it! (heads for the
dialog: door)
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Where you going!
speaker_heading: BOBBY (exiting)
dialog: 'Scuse me, you want to take my head off,
dialog: mister. I won't even try to stop you. I
dialog: deserve it for being an idiot. But if
dialog: you're not, I think I'll be on my way...
dialog: Ow!
text: Jake punches him in the nose.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You can't just walk in here and walk out,
dialog: you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new
dialog: asshole!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You broke my nose!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It ain't broke.
text: It probably isn't, but it bleeds. Bobby feels the blood and then
text: sees it on his shirt.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Goddamn it! I'm... you're lucky I don't sue
dialog: you.
text: JAKE (opens the door)
dialog: Get goin' Junior.
text: Bobby glares back at Grace who gives him a maddening little smile.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You people are crazy!
text: He storms out holding his nose.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - LATER - DAY
text: BOBBY, holding a handkerchief to his nose which has stopped
text: bleeding, hauling his bag on his shoulder, walks back to town
text: along the side of the road. Already he is caked with a mixture
text: of sweat and dust, looking up at the relentless sun that beats
text: down on him.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Fuckin' shithole!
text: A CADILLAC slows beside him, JAKE driving.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What the fuck do you want?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be
dialog: walking... People die out here, y'know.
text: Bobby continues walking.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Aw, you're not still upset about that love
dialog: tap, are you? If I meant you real trouble,
dialog: I'd have given it to you by now. Get in,
dialog: lad. Come on. Get in.
text: Bobby gets in.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I
dialog: got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants
dialog: to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it
dialog: instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that.
dialog: It's a funny thing, women.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Say, what happened to your hand?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Accident.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You've got to be--
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, I know. More careful.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I guess we've never been introduced proper.
dialog: Jake McKenna.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's a solid name.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm a solid man.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Bobby Cooper.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: "Bobby Cooper." What brings you to
dialog: Superior, Coop?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: An overheated car.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Darrell's a moron.
dialog: JAKE (laughs)
dialog: Yeah, he sure is a character. You need any
dialog: help with that car now?... Where you
dialog: headed?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: California...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Live there?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Got work. I know a man who's got a boat.
dialog: Wants me to sail it for him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You a sailor man? That'd be the life.
dialog: Drive across the country, step on a boat
dialog: and just sail away. A man could pretty
dialog: well disappear like that. Just sail away
dialog: until all he was was a memory. I guess a
dialog: little place like this would just be a dot
dialog: on a map to you after awhile.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I hope so. (beat) Listen, McKenna about
dialog: your wife: If I had known she was
dialog: married--
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It wouldn't have made a difference to you,
dialog: now would it? Not a wit. Do you know why?
dialog: Because you're a man without scruples.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Wait a second--
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Ah, I can smell it on you.
text: Jake wipes his hand across the back of Bobby's neck and holds it
text: to his nose.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an
dialog: honest bone in his body. Don't be
dialog: offended, lad. A man who's got no ethics
dialog: is a free man. I envy that. Beside, how
dialog: can I blame you? That Grace sure has a
dialog: mind of her own, and a body to match, don't
dialog: she? Eh?
text: Jake nudges Bobby who smiles a nervous smile.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: She does at that. I knew when I married
text: her she was a free spirit. A woman with
dialog: her looks and a man my age; what was I to
dialog: expect? But you see a woman like that in a
dialog: town like this and you don't think, you do.
dialog: So, I married her. What are you to do, eh?
dialog: Women.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Can't live with them, and you can't shoot
dialog: 'em.
text: Jake looks at Bobby, his lips curled into a sly smile.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: "You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.
dialog: (laughs) I bet she led you on good, didn't
dialog: she? Taking you up to the house to hang
dialog: drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had
dialog: you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your
dialog: face. I bet you just wanted to pull down
text: her pants and hog her out. Then me busting
dialog: in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a
dialog: fire going under you.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Like you don't know.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were. I
dialog: can tell you got a temper on you.
text: Bobby gives a little laugh.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Bet you just wanted to snap her neck right
dialog: then, didn't you? Bet you just wanted to
dialog: kill her.
text: Bobby starts to laugh heartily. Jake joins in, then stops
text: abruptly.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Would you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Would I what?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Would you kill her?
text: Bobby starts to laugh. Bobby stops laughing.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Because I'm sick and tired of her little
dialog: games. Because you could do it and drift
dialog: away on your boat and no one would ever see
dialog: you again. Because I've got a
dialog: fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy
dialog: on her, and I would be more than happy to
dialog: give the man who does her in a good chunk
dialog: of it.
text: For a moment Bobby sits in silence not sure of what to make of
dialog: the offer.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I've done a few things but I'm not a
dialog: murderer, Mr. McKenna.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How do you know if you've never tried?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: This is a joke, right? You just want to
dialog: rattle me. Right?
text: They reach town and Jake stops the car near a small GROCERY
speaker_heading: STORE.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's right. Nothing but a joke. That's
dialog: all.
text: Bobby gets out of the car. With a big smile Jake says:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Enjoy your stay, lad.
text: Jake speeds away. Bobby looks after him.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Who are these people?
scene_heading: INT. SMALL GROCERY STORE - LATER
text: The store is small and dark and empty save for a tiny, older
text: Mexican WOMAN who is behind the counter. BOBBY enters.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Got any cold soda?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Eh?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Soda. You got any soda?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es
dialog: bien.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Soda. You know.
text: Bobby cups his hand and brings it to his mouth pantomiming.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh. Something to eat. Si.
text: She holds up a pack of Twinkies.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Not eat. Drink. What the fuck is drink in
dialog: Spanish ... uh, agua?
text: The old woman's eyes widen. She starts to scream, but quickly
text: clamps her hands over her mouth. For a moment Bobby thinks the
text: woman is screaming at what he has said. Then, as if he feels a
text: presence behind him, Bobby turns slowly to face the TWO
text: tough-looking, unshaven, tattoo-covered BIKERS. One holds a
dialog: gun.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: That's right, lady. Keep it in you and
dialog: nobody gets hurt. That goes for you too,
dialog: stud. Gimmie the money. Now!
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Eh?
speaker_heading: SECOND BIKER
dialog: The dinero, Senora. Hand it over.
text: Bobby shifts his weight trying to hide his pack behind his back.
text: The woman goes to an old-fashioned cash register and rings it
text: open. She hands the money to the biker.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: That's it? Lady, I got kids to put through
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Es all I have.
text: The biker turns to Bobby.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Okay, pal. Whatcha got? Give it, now.
text: Bobby pulls a thick wad of cash ($1,000 plus) from his pant
text: pocket, tosses it on the counter.
text: BIKER (thumbing through it, impressed)
dialog: Nice...Just who are you beautiful? What
dialog: else you got for papa?
text: Bobby makes a show of pulling out his wallet, flings it to him.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Better...you're getting tasty. Now toss the
dialog: bag, sweetie.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It's just books.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: I'm a reader. Toss it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (an entreaty)
dialog: It's personal things...family things.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: How touching...I like family values. Give
dialog: it to me.
text: Bobby takes an unsteady breath.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: SECOND BIKER
dialog: Hey man, forget it. Come on.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Senor, give him the bag.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: That's all right. He doesn't want to give
dialog: me the bag...
speaker_heading: SECOND BIKER
dialog: He's fucking with you man. Shoot him.
speaker_heading: BIKER (cont'd)
dialog: ...he doesn't have to give me the bag.
text: The biker grabs Bobby's bag. Bobby flinches in anticipation of a
text: shot but refuses to let go of the bag. The biker swings the gun
text: hard, clipping Bobby across the forehead. Bobby falls against
text: the counter and to the floor. The woman starts to scream. The
text: biker grabs up the pack, then, looking back at the woman, sees a
text: ring on her finger. He grabs her hand and pulls at the ring.
text: The woman screams wildly.
speaker_heading: SECOND BIKER
dialog: Let's go, man.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: A little extra never hurt, Benji, would you
dialog: just relax.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: No! No! My wedding ring.
text: He pulls the ring from the woman's finger and pushes her back.
text: With Bobby's bag slung over his shoulder he turns to leave.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Now we go.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You go to El Diablo!
text: From beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun. The woman
text: fires A SHOT that rips through the bag and into the back of the
text: biker. He falls to the ground, very dead, amid a shower of
text: blood and shredded money.
speaker_heading: SECOND BIKER
dialog: Bugger! You bitch!
text: The Second Biker now sees the money floating all over the place
text: out of the torn bag. His eyes go big with greed as he FIRES at
text: the old woman, who ducks behind the counter.
text: The Biker grabs for the bag and what's left of the money, not
text: expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her SECOND
text: BLAST into him and the bag.
text: Whatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to
text: shreds along with the bag and the Biker who is very dead.
text: Bobby is staggered, crawls towards the shreds.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (cursing in Spanish)
dialog: Hijos de puta. Bayan a comer su propia
scene_heading: mierda en el infierno. (TRANSLATION: Sons
dialog: of bitches. Go eat your own shit in hell).
text: She comes around the counter to his side as he grabs his wallet
text: and the $1000 cash roll from the dead biker's pants.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I call the sheriff.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No! No police.
text: Bobby gives her a hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: A hundred dollars? No police?
text: Bobby gives her some more cash. She looks at him. Finally he
text: gives her the entire wad.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No police until I leave.
text: Bobby stumbles from the store as the screen burns a bright white.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER
text: BOBBY, dazed and holding his head, sits on the ground next to a
text: SPIGOT that is dripping water. He cups his hands under the
text: water and splashes it against his face, lightly wiping the cut
text: above his eye. The SHERIFF'S CAR goes wailing by on the main
text: drag. Recoiling from being spotted, Bobby tries to take another
text: drink. A SCORPION crawls out of the faucet. He jumps back.
scene_heading: EXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - LATER
text: DARRELL is leaning under the hood of a car working on its engine
text: as BOBBY walks up.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Hey, your ... what the hell happened to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Don't look like nothing.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Just banged my head. It was an accident.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Another accident? You got to be more
dialog: careful.
text: Bobby rolls his eyes. Then notices the front fenders have been
dialog: removed.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What the hell happened to my car?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
text: Bottom hose was shot too. Rotted clear
dialog: through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like
text: a dream now.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (suspicious)
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Well ... you got your parts, you got your
dialog: labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty
dialog: bucks.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: How much!?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Hundred-fifty.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
text: A goddamn radiator hose in a
dialog: sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang. You know
dialog: how long it took me to find that hose?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: About an hour and a half, because that's
dialog: all the longer I've been gone.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Actually, it's been about three hours.
dialog: You're the one thinks that car's so damn
dialog: fancy. What you expect but fancy damn
dialog: prices?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to
dialog: tell me no one else in this shit hole
dialog: drives a Ford?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: "That's not just a Ford, that's a
text: sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living
dialog: here and you're just passing through." Now you
dialog: owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It might as well be fifteen-hundred
dialog: dollars, because I don't have the money.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Then you ain't gonna have the car.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Listen, man. I got rolled half an hour ago
dialog: for everything I had.
text: Bobby digs through his bloodied wallet, trying to hide it from
text: Darrell. He fishes out a five dollar bill. Then digs out a
text: bloody one dollar bill from his pocket.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I've got five...six dollars.
text: Darrell snatches the five from him and adds it to a thick wad of
text: greasy bills he carries in his overalls.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in
dialog: the hole. You can keep that dollar. Now
dialog: why don't you just take your American
dialog: Express Gold Card, and call that guy with
dialog: the big schnooz on TV and have him send you
dialog: the money lickity split.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't have a goddamn credit card.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Now that's too bad. I sure hope you know
dialog: how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause
dialog: you're gonna have to work this one off.
text: Bobby proffers his Movado watch.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Look, I got a Movado. It's worth at least
dialog: seven, eight hundred. You could sell it for
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: DARRELL (studying it)
dialog: Who the hell to? Shit, can't see no
dialog: numbers.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You don't need numbers. That's why it's
dialog: expensive. Look at the gold.
text: Darrell doubts that, shake his head.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: ...got no day, got no date. Probably ain't
dialog: worth a duck's fart (proffers his own
dialog: watch). This one here cost me $3.75 and
dialog: it's got every doodad you can imagine. No
dialog: sir I'll stick with this (walks away).
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers
dialog: shut you down.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: You ain't got no credit card but you got a
dialog: lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want. Didn't
dialog: you read the sign? It says...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
text: Bobby stands his ground for a moment as if deciding whether or
text: not to fight for the car, then wheels and walks away.
text: Darrell looks at him, smirks.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP/DINER - LATER
text: It is a little worn diner-type stop one would find on most any
text: open road: Counter with stools, laminated menus, a Wurlitzer in
text: the corner belching out country TUNES. Business is slow but
text: it's the only restaurant in town. There is a SHORT ORDER COOK in
text: the kitchen, and FLO, a hard-looking waitress is behind the
text: counter. A couple of regular drivers, ED and BOYD, are seated
text: on the stools, Boyd is flipping a coin.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: One-hundred-thirteen degrees. That was
dialog: back in July of forty-seven. That afternoon
dialog: it dropped down to forty three! True story.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: One time last year I remember it went from
text: 98 to 23 same day. Wind, black clouds come
dialog: out like...
text: BOBBY comes out of the men's room and sits at the end of the
text: counter. He has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a
text: mess. He buries his face in the menu.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You got a beer?
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: What kind?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Beck's.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Heineken?
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: No, we ain't got no Heineken. We got
dialog: Miller.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Genuine Draft?
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: No. Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can

dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
scene_heading: SHORT ORDER COOK
dialog: Flo, cheeseburger bleedin'.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: I'll be right back with that beer.
text: Flo moves off.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: ...and a waitress named Flo. Christ.
text: As Bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him, he
text: hears, from somewhere outside the diner, the sound of a POLICE
text: RADIO crackling. He now feels something against his foot. He
text: looks down and sees a CAT rubbing against his leg. He gives it
text: a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Fucking cat.
text: In the background, two teenagers sit at a booth. TOBY looks the
text: part of a local, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt. His hair is
text: cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school. His
text: girl, JENNY, is nondescript, neither ugly nor beautiful. She is
text: the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look.
text: Toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom. After he
text: is gone Jenny walks to Bobby.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter for the
dialog: juke?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a
dialog: quarter?
text: Bobby looks at Jenny, then picks a quarter from his winnings and
text: flips it to her. He can't resist putting a little charm into it.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What happened to your hand?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more
dialog: careful.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Got any requests?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That country shit all sounds the same to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: How about I pick one out for you?
text: Bobby half smiles. Jenny plays a song. Patsy Cline's "Your
text: Cheatin' Heart." Jenny takes up a stool next to Bobby's.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You like Patsy Cline? I just love her.
dialog: How come, I wonder, she don't put out no
dialog: more new records.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Cause she's dead.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I've had time to get over it.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You're not from around here, are you?
dialog: Where you from?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oz.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that movie.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You're too quick for me.
text: Toby walks back into the room. He looks at Jenny. He looks at
text: Bobby. He looks at Jenny talking to Bobby. He loses it.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: No....No....No I'm seeing but I'm not
dialog: believin'...Stop the wedding. This can't
dialog: be. Hey! What are you doing with my girl?
text: Bobby says nothing, ignoring Toby.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I axed you a question.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was
text: just talking.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You shut your mouth, girl, and get back
dialog: over to our table. (to Bobby) Now, I'm not
dialog: going to axe you again, Mister. What were
dialog: you doing with my girl?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I wasn't doing anything.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: That's not the way it looked to me. Looked
dialog: to me like you was trying to make time with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Make time? Is everybody in this town on
dialog: drugs?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Honest, Toby. I just axed him for a
text: quarter for the jukebox.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man's
dialog: business to take care of. I ain't never
dialog: taken no drugs, mister, and ...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I
dialog: wasn't making a play for your girl.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You expect me to believe that?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't care what you believe as long as
dialog: you leave me alone.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Mister, I'm calling you out.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What? You want to fight? Over her?
text: Bobby looks Jenny over.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: Toby, you go finish your soda and leave the
dialog: man alone.
speaker_heading: TOBY (to Bobby)
dialog: You know who I am? Toby N. Tucker.
dialog: Everyone round here call me TNT. You know
dialog: why?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: 'Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I
text: go off, somebody gets hurt.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Fine. I was making time with your girl.
dialog: Now I'm scared to death and I learned my
dialog: lesson. Now can you go away?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Christ, I don't believe this!
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Stand up.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I wasn't hitting on your girl!
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where
dialog: you sit.
text: Bobby sits for a beat. he doesn't need a fight with Toby now
text: with his damaged hand nor does he need to be noticed either. He
text: sits there.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: Toby, you stop it now! Can't you see he's
dialog: got a hurt hand?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Don't you never mind, Flo. This is gonna
dialog: be over real quick.
text: Reluctantly Bobby rises, facing off against Toby, each clenching
text: their fist and waiting for the other to make the first move.
text: The tension builds. We see it on the faces of Jenny, Flo and
text: the regulars. Just then the record on the juke ends and the
text: needle scratches off. There is the crackle of a police radio as
text: the door to the diner opens and SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER walks in.
text: The tension eases. Toby, mindful of the sheriff, steps closer to
text: Bobby and whispers menacingly into his ear.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You're lucky, Mister. Don't think it's
dialog: over. I called you out and I'm gonna see
dialog: this through. You hear me? (to Jenny)
dialog: Come on, girl. I got half a mind to make
dialog: you walk home.
text: Toby takes Jenny by the arm and pulls her out of the diner.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil,
dialog: has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: What was that all about?
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: You know how that Toby is. Thinks every
text: man he sees is after his Jenny.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: More like Jenny is after every man she
dialog: sees.
dialog: FLO (to Bobby)
dialog: You pay Toby no mind. He just likes to
dialog: show off for his girl. Give him a couple
dialog: of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that
dialog: beer?
text: BOBBY (tense, seeing the Sheriff)
dialog: I'll take it to go.
text: Bobby holds his hand to his face to cover the cut on his
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How's it with you, Sheriff?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
text: Already started out bad. Couple of bikers
text: from out of town tried to knock over
dialog: Jamilla's grocery store this morning. It
dialog: was a real shootout.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: The old witch killed 'em both.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Holy shit!
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: Poor thing. Is she all right?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Sure, when the sons of bitches tried to
dialog: steal her wedding ring. That's when she
dialog: started shooting. Can't blame her. The
dialog: ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
dialog: Store's a mess.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: It's the desert. That's what it is. The
dialog: desert makes everybody crazy. Ain't that
dialog: right, Sheriff? People go crazy out here.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Come on, Boyd. I've got to make tracks.
dialog: That yogurt's got to make Santa Fe before
dialog: it spoils.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Dr. Pepper don't have that problem.
text: Ed and Boyd toss a few bills on the counter and exit. Flo
text: stands near the cash register with Bobby's beer.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: I can't open off-sale for you, sugar.
text: Bobby pays for the beer ($1.75). Flo opens the register.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: Let me get your change.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill
text: on the coffee.
text: The Sheriff reaches around the counter for the pot.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: You be careful now, Virgil.
text: Just as the words leave Flo's mouth the Sheriff spills the pot.
text: It shatters against the floor spilling hot coffee everywhere.
text: Flo runs over to him.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Son of a bitch!
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: Virgil! Now look at what you done! Are
dialog: you all right?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I think I burned my gun hand!
text: As Flo bends to wipe the counter, Virgil touches her intimately.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF (Cont'd)
dialog: How 'bout we put something soft on it
dialog: later? (a look)
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: (quietly) I could put some butter on it,
dialog: hon'. (Her normal abrasive voice) It'd
dialog: serve you right, you asshole. Put it under
dialog: some cold water. Joe, run get a mop and
dialog: clean this fuckin' mess up.
text: While everyone is distracted Bobby notices that the register
text: drawer has been left open. He looks around to make sure he is
text: not being watched. Slowly he eases his hand towards the drawer.
text: It gets closer and closer. As he is about to grab the money
text: there, the cat - the same one he kicked away earlier - hisses
text: and claws at his hand. Bobby jumps back startled.
speaker_heading: FLO
dialog: Shasta! Now why'd you go and scare the
dialog: nice man like that? Sorry about that,
dialog: mister. Let's see, you want $3.25. (gives
dialog: it to him) You try to have a nice day now,
dialog: would you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sure, I'll try.
text: With the Sheriff occupied, and the Mexican Jose mopping the
text: floor, Bobby exits.
scene_heading: EXT. PHONE BOOTH - STREET - DAY
text: BOBBY begs on the phone.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Cici? Cici, it's Bobby...Bobby
dialog: Cooper...Yeah, look, I know it's been a
dialog: while, but I'm kind of in a
dialog: jam...yeah...One-hundred-fifty
dialog: dollars...That's a lie. I called you on
dialog: your birthday..Two years ago...I can't help
dialog: it if you didn't get the message. Cici,
dialog: honey, I don't want to argue. I need you to
dialog: wire me the money...Because they're fucking
dialog: going to KILL ME! I didn't steal your
dialog: CD's...Yeah, well where's my Mr. Coffee.
dialog: Cici...Cici...
text: Bobby slams the phone.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Bitch. Cunt.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SAME PHONE BOOTH - STREET - DAY
text: BOBBY is on another call, circling a local sports page betting
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: 73-11, this is Pluto. What's the line on
dialog: Dallas?
speaker_heading: GAMBLER'S VOICE
text: Pluto. Fucking deadbeat. We head about
dialog: you. You owe "the commie" 13 dimes, why you
dialog: tryin' to get in my office? Lose this
dialog: fuckin' number.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Mike...Mike...you asshole.
speaker_heading: GAMBLER'S VOICE
dialog: Mike who?
dialog: (hangs up)
text: Bobby, frustrated, clicks off.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MR. ARKADY'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: It is the kind of cheesy, temporary office one would expect to
text: find in a Las Vegas apartment building overlooking the DOWNTOWN
text: STRIP. MR. ARKADY, dressed in a silk suit with conspicuous
text: jewelry, sits behind his desk eating lunch and cleaning his
text: nails. SERGEI, his goon in a shiny polyester shirt, hovers over
text: his boss helping feed and manicure him. These are the TWO MEN
text: from Bobby's earlier FLASHBACK. They are dangerous in an
text: endearing way. Sergei answers the phone. In the background is a
text: very voluptuous female, obviously from the Middle East. SOFIA.
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: Da?
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: Sergei, what are you, a Neanderthal? How
dialog: many times do I have to tell you? You
dialog: answer a phone "hello," not "da."
speaker_heading: SERGEI (nods yes)
dialog: Sorry, Mr. Arkady.(into phone)"Hello?"
speaker_heading: OPERATOR(V.O.)
dialog: I have a collect call from Bobby Cooper.
dialog: Will you accept the charges?
speaker_heading: SERGEI
text: Mr. Arkady, deadbeat Cooper's calling.
text: Mr. Arkady doesn't acknowledge him.
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: He's calling collect.
text: At this Mr. Arkady's head springs up. He snatches the phone
dialog: from Sergei.
dialog: MR. ARKADY (overly sweet)
dialog: Bobby, what a surprise. I expected to be
dialog: seeing you, not talking to you over the
dialog: phone.
scene_heading: INTERCUTS TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PHONE BOOTH - STREET
text: BOBBY on the phone.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I know, Mr. Arkadin. I know. I was on my
dialog: way to you, it's just ... what a day I've
dialog: had. I know I'm coming up with a highly
dialog: improbable story, and I know you're not
dialog: going to believe this, but this ...is...
dialog: what happened. I had the money, I swear I
dialog: had it. I was on my way to Vegas when my
text: car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
text: Mr. Arkady cleans his nails completely disinterested in what
text: Bobby is saying.
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: That's a shame, Bobby. A real shame.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: And that's not the half of it, Mr.
dialog: Arkadin...
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: "Arkady"
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half
dialog: of it. I got your money, and I go into this
dialog: little grocery store in this hicktown to
dialog: get something to eat and then... well, it
dialog: gets robbed!
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: ...And let me guess. This robber -- he
dialog: gets your money.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they both
dialog: get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: The old lady?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: With a shotgun! She kills both of 'em,
dialog: and... and the money in my bag gets all
text: shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is
dialog: left alive. I mean, what are the odds?
scene_heading: MR. ARKADY (beat, dry)
dialog: Pretty long, Bobby.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta
dialog: there before the cops showed. So now I
dialog: don't have a cent to my name. I can't even
dialog: get my car out of the garage. I tell you,
dialog: Mister... (pause) if it weren't for bad
dialog: luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at
dialog: all, you know? (beat, waits) So, I was
dialog: wondering if you could wire me a hundred
dialog: fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of
dialog: this garage, see? The bus depot here has a
dialog: Western Union thing. And of course I'll
dialog: pay it back with the rest of the money.
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY(V.O.)
dialog: Which you don't have.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: But which I can get. No problem. Look, I
dialog: can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's
dialog: worth 16 at least. I just need the 150,
dialog: uh...
text: Sergei looks like he's ready to pound heads.
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY (pause)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY (hopeful)
dialog: Uh...a little shithole in Arizona called
text: Superior. About 200 miles east of Phoenix.
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY (pausing, V.O.)
dialog: Superior, hunh?
text: Bobby suddenly feeling suspicious.
speaker_heading: BOBBY(V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, if you could send it care of...
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: ...Now, let me get this straight. Two years
dialog: you give me problems with your fuckin'
dialog: payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand
dialog: dollars, you call me - collect - then ask
dialog: me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars
dialog: just so you can get your car fixed.
speaker_heading: BOBBY(V.O.)
dialog: A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: A hundred and ... Now you listen to me
dialog: you deadbeat little punk: I don't care if
dialog: you got hit by a truck and run over by a
dialog: steamroller. You owe me thirteen-thousand
dialog: dollars and I want it. I don't care how
dialog: you get it, or where from, but I want it on
dialog: my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what
dialog: real bad luck is.
text: Sergei snaps a pencil he's holding in his hand, which goes
text: flying by Arkady's head, forcing him to duck.
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: Do you understand me you little fuck?
speaker_heading: BOBBY (snaps)
dialog: Oh, fuck you too!
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: What'd you say to me!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the
dialog: strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of
dialog: strain here.
text: There is a sharp silence at the other end. Bobby waits.
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: Bobby, you owed me that 'bread' 4 weeks
dialog: ago. Now you tell me you want another week.
dialog: That's 5 weeks, Bobby. That's also 5
dialog: fingers, cause you and I know it's a finger
dialog: a week Bobby. So you got balls. Good--now
dialog: you come here tomorrow and you talk to me
dialog: real nice and maybe I don't take the other
dialog: 3 fingers you owe me, you see? Tomorrow --
dialog: and Bobby, don't make me come look for you,
dialog: okay...have nice day.
text: He hands the phone back to Sergei.
speaker_heading: SERGEI (into phone)
dialog: You got that? -- have nice day (hangs up).
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: The nerva that piece of shit! And look at
dialog: you, you Neanderthal -- don't you fuckin'
dialog: break pencils, you goombah!
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Finger? What are you, a faggot? In my
dialog: country a man don't pay we cut off his
dialog: head.
text: Arkady motions Sergei to come close.
speaker_heading: MR. ARKADY
dialog: Get your ass down to this Superior,
dialog: Arizona. Bring me this Bobby Cooper. I
dialog: don't think he got the lesson. This is your
dialog: last chance, Sergei.
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: Da.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: BOBBY, desperate, stares at the bandage of his wounded hand. It
text: throbs, holding the hand to his ear.
text: We hear an OPERATOR'S VOICE:
speaker_heading: OPERATOR(V.O.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: OPERATOR(V.O.)
dialog: Are you finished with your call?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR(V.O.)
dialog: Please deposit an additional seventy-five
dialog: cents.
text: Bobby slams the phone against the hook.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Goddamn rat's ass fuck! Shit! Damn! Damn!
dialog: Damn!
text: He marches from the phone booth, past an old HARDWARE STORE. The
text: phone falls from the hook and we hear a recorded voice:
speaker_heading: VOICE(V.O.)
dialog: Thank you for using AT&amp;T.
text: In the store window, Bobby notices a set of garden shears for
dialog: sale.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY STREET - LATER DAY
text: BOBBY walks a bit going nowhere in particular. Looking at his
text: watch thinking of Mr. Arkady, he shields himself with one hand
text: from the sun. At the side of an old building, in the bit of
text: shade it throws, he twists at the beer cap which sticks and
text: won't turn. Bobby tries again twisting harder -- too hard -- as
text: the cap jerkily twists off, cutting into his hand as it rotates.
text: Bobby yells in pain. At the same time the beer comes foaming
text: from the bottle and spills onto his sleeve. The bottle slips
text: from his wet fingers and crashes on the ground, emptying. He
text: clutches his bleeding hand, pissed.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I hate this fuckin' town!
dialog: I hate it! Do you hear me?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Get me outta here, please. I gotta get out
dialog: of this place.
text: As if in answer, a JEEP drives by on the main street. GRACE
text: looks pretty hot up there in the driver's seat, her eyes, behind
text: sunglasses, flicking over him but not acknowledging him as she
text: keeps going.
text: Bobby's eyes throw back his own hostility at her, but
text: unfortunately she misses it, as he now notices -- across the
text: street -- a well-kept building with the most modern decor and
text: signage, reading "McKenna's Realty Co."
text: He thinks about it, in a quandary.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY/CAR - DAY
text: In a rented convertible, we now see SERGEI racing across the
text: desert. His jacket off, a man with a mission. He glances at his
text: watch, eager to get to this "fucking hole in the wall" which is
text: somewhere on this incomprehensible American map he holds in one
dialog: hand.
scene_heading: INT. JAKE'S REALTY OFFICE - DAY
text: BOBBY squats, looking at a real estate model of a desert
text: development. JAKE smiles.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What can I do for you, lad?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I was hoping we could talk.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Talk? About what?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: About things. About your wife.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sweet Grace? What about her?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: About what you said this morning.
text: Jake shakes his head as if he doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You said you had an insurance policy out on
dialog: your wife. Fifty-thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You said you'd cut that up with the man who
dialog: did her in.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I did?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a
dialog: betting man. You want me to spell it out
dialog: for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in
dialog: on the money.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way
dialog: you're rambling on.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm not rambling.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You're talking like a madman.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well then, I guess that qualifies me for
dialog: citizenship in this town. You're the one
dialog: brought it up. This morning. In your car.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband
dialog: gettin' pissed off. I don't want anybody
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: A man doesn't always mean the things he
dialog: says.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You meant it.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What makes you say that?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Because you're a slimy bastard who would
dialog: have his wife killed just to get his hands
dialog: on some money.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And what does that make you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: The slimy bastard who's going to do it for
dialog: you... (pause) You're a jealous man Jake.
dialog: If you can't have Grace to yourself...well,
dialog: you're not the sharing kind.
text: For a moment Jake stares quietly at Bobby.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Well, I guess I have what you call a
dialog: love-hate relationship with Grace.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You love her, but you hate her?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of
dialog: person she is. I hate having to tolerate
dialog: the little "games" she plays. Like fucking
dialog: half of the town behind my back and
dialog: laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to
dialog: play. She wants me to hit her and when I
dialog: hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But
dialog: she's family. She's my little girl. My
dialog: baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes
text: roll back in her head as she sucks her last
dialog: breath, or to see her pretty pink brains
dialog: spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you?
dialog: You got the killing in you, boy...How much
dialog: you want?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Make it twenty.
dialog: JAKE (stressed, paces)
dialog: Twenty-thousand? I don't have that kind of
dialog: money. I won't get the insurance until
dialog: months after she's dead. I don't imagine
dialog: you'll want to be stickin' around after
dialog: poor Grace's demise. Twenty-thousand;
dialog: that's more money than I could ever get my
text: hands on.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: How much could you get?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Maybe ... ten-thousand. And that's a
dialog: maybe.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I need thirteen.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's a bit much.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We're not talking about buying a car Jake.
dialog: We're talking about killing your wife. It's
dialog: thirteen, or it's nothing.
text: For a moment the two men stand silent. All we hear is the
text: ticking of a grandfather CLOCK that stands in the corner.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You drive a hard bargain, but I had a
dialog: feeling you were my boy when I met you.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm not your boy. I don't like you. I got
dialog: no choice but to do business with you.
dialog: Let's just call this a nasty little
dialog: marriage of convenience.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Don't say that. I had a marriage of
dialog: convenience with Grace, and look where
dialog: that's lead... Well, looks like we got
dialog: ourselves a contract.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (sarcastic)
dialog: Do we shake hands?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: If you can't trust the man you've hired to
dialog: kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got
dialog: to look like an accident; that's the thing.
dialog: If it doesn't, then it's no good. I won't
dialog: get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on
dialog: the chopping block while you're living it
text: up somewhere.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: How do you want it?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How the hell should I know? I've never had
dialog: a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! You
dialog: want this job, you don't know how to do
dialog: this? I guess I should have hired a
dialog: professional.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You want to do this yourself? I don't have
dialog: to do this, you know.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Be quiet, boy. I got to figure this thing.
dialog: I'm thinking. It can't be done at the
dialog: house. It should be...
text: Jake walks the office thinking.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Come to think of it, how 'bout some money
dialog: upfront?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane
dialog: ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I
dialog: know you...
dialog: (then)
dialog: This is what you do: Go to the house to
dialog: see her.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And tell her what?
scene_heading: EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER DAY
text: BOBBY stands on the porch talking to GRACE through the screen of
text: the front door. The look on his face is sincere. Hers is
text: skeptical. We see the action take place as we hear Jake's V.O.:
speaker_heading: JAKE(V.O.)
dialog: ...I don't know. Tell her you had to see
dialog: her. Tell her you don't care if she's
dialog: married or not, you had to be with her.
text: Sweet talk the woman. A young buck like
dialog: you must be good at that. Then ... maybe
dialog: shift the conversation. Get her thinking
dialog: about that jeep of hers. She loves that
text: thing. Maybe the only thing she does love.
dialog: She'll want to take you for a ride.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I know you're not surprised I'm back here,
dialog: cause you can read my mind and all.
text: She's not surprised.
dialog: GRACE (seeing his new cut)
dialog: That's some cut. I told you to be more
dialog: careful.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta
dialog: you say we get out of here, take a drive
dialog: somewhere, talk...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: How do you know he's still not here?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: GRACE'S JEEP cuts hard across the desert. Grace has a wild,
text: excited look on her face. BOBBY sits next to her looking
text: somewhat nervous.
speaker_heading: JAKE(V.O.)
dialog: She'll take you out somewhere in the
dialog: desert. She loves it out there; ridin'
text: through the red rock and the mesas. So do
dialog: I. I guess we got that in common. She'll
dialog: ride you out someplace quiet. Someplace
dialog: deserted.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - LATER DAY
text: GRACE has stopped the JEEP on a plateau. BOBBY sits beneath its
text: shade while Grace walks in the sun seemingly unaffected by the
text: heat. VULTURES swoop above.
speaker_heading: JAKE(V.O.)
dialog: There won't be anyone for miles around.
dialog: Just the two of you and some prairie dogs.
dialog: That's all. You can sweet talk her a
dialog: little if you like. Makes no difference to
dialog: me. Just put her at ease, make her feel
dialog: relaxed -- then do it.
text: JAKE'S V.O. ends. The scene is now synch with real time.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Are there snakes out here?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: They hear you comin'. They won't bother
dialog: you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Doesn't the isolation bother you?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a
dialog: reservation. The sun, the desert; they
dialog: like a religion to us. Jake's the same
dialog: way. He loves the desert. I guess we're
dialog: alike that way. That's about the only way.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You love him?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Did you ever?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Depends on what you call love. I grew up on
text: a reservation. A patch of desert in the
dialog: middle of nowhere. That's where they stick
dialog: Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us
dialog: to die. My brother killed himself when he
dialog: was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore.
dialog: There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket
dialog: out. Mom and me.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Is that why you're with him?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I let him think he was courtin' me, but I
text: reeled him in like a fish on a line. I
dialog: wanted him. I wanted what he could give me,
dialog: and I would've done anything to get him. Is
dialog: that love?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm guessing no.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yeah, I guess you're right.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I take it things didn't much work out the
dialog: way you planned.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
text: Grace sweeps her hand before her across the expanse of the
text: desert. The vultures are very much a part of this landscape.
speaker_heading: GRACE(CONT)
dialog: All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake
dialog: like it gets to me. He says he don't mind
text: being nothing but a big fish in a small
text: pond. More like a little fish in a dried
text: up watering hole.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You could leave him.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I don't know how.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Walk away.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's not that easy. Maybe you can take
dialog: chances; maybe you can wander around like
dialog: some stray wherever you please. I can't.
dialog: I don't want to be alone. I need to know
dialog: I'm going to be taken care of.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You need a meal ticket is what you mean.
dialog: Some guy you can latch onto just long
dialog: enough for him to get you out of here.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't
dialog: try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway.
dialog: I mean, I would ... do things for him. I
dialog: guess I'm no good that way. I guess I
dialog: tried to sucker you along like that. Do
dialog: you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you
dialog: if you did. But maybe it's like you said:
dialog: You just got to do whatever it takes to get
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (soft echo)
dialog: Whatever it takes.
text: Grace steps to the edge of the plateau.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I wish I was a bird. I know it's stupid.
dialog: Every child says that. When I was growing
dialog: up some of the old ones on the reservation
dialog: believed people could actually change into
dialog: animals. I wish I could.
text: We see Bobby behind Grace. He stares at her standing on the
text: edge of the plateau. He rises and walks towards her slowly, but
text: with deliberation.
speaker_heading: GRACE(CONT)
dialog: If I was a bird I would fly to Florida; to
dialog: Disney World. I always wanted to go there.
dialog: I'd fly to New York. Maybe. I guess New
dialog: York isn't the best place to be a bird.
dialog: I'd fly to St. Louis, then New Orleans, all
dialog: over Texas. Then I'd fly to California. I
dialog: guess by then I'd have seen it all and I
dialog: could die.
text: Bobby now stands a few feet behind Grace. She kicks a rock and
text: watches it sail over the lip of the cliff into the nothingness
dialog: below.
speaker_heading: GRACE(CONT)
dialog: They say you don't feel anything. The
dialog: shock kills you before you hit the ground.
dialog: I don't know how they would know that. But
dialog: I heard it's just like flying; straight
dialog: down into the ground. I guess if it
dialog: doesn't hurt it's a beautiful thing.
text: Bobby tenses himself. Sweat forms on his brow as he stands
text: directly behind Grace with his hands extended before him. They
text: hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push forward.
text: Suddenly Grace wheels. Startled by Bobby she almost falls over
text: the edge. Bobby grabs her, her weight still going back.
text: Grace's life is literally in his hands. She looks down at the
text: ground far below, then up into Bobby's eyes. She shows no fear,
text: but instead wears a curious smirk.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Hate's a funny thing. Right now I bet you
dialog: don't know if you want to kill me, or fuck
dialog: me.
text: Bobby hesitates, then pulls Grace close and kisses her with
text: great ardor on the lips.
scene_heading: EXT. APACHE LEAP - DAY
text: On a blanket on the ground, BOBBY and GRACE make love quickly,
text: hotly, her dress pulled up, his pants down. But Grace is
text: troubled and pulls out, further frustrating Bobby.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No...Stop! I can't!
text: Her eyes withdraw into another dimension, as she hikes her dress
text: back up. Bobby comes out of his own head, feels the distance
dialog: between them.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What's the matter?...Grace?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Don't feel like nothing.
text: He finishes relieving himself behind a tree, puts his pants back
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you
dialog: can.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Grace, I've been fucked over too many
dialog: times, by too many women. You're becoming
dialog: the queen of hot and cold.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You'd never understand.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Try me.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nothing I understand better than a mess.
dialog: GRACE (in great tension)
dialog: Jake was with my Mom after my real Dad
dialog: died.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You mean the Shaman?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: He was a Shaman...in the mine. We had
dialog: nothin' after he died. Jake took us in,
dialog: gave us a little money. He used to call me
dialog: his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on
dialog: the side y'know, cause he was married
dialog: someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I
dialog: think, no one knew him around here...but
dialog: the thing was...you see...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: ...he was raping me the whole time...for
dialog: years. He loved to do things to me. Believe
dialog: it or not, he used to say he was in love
dialog: with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a
dialog: woman's ass?
text: The dominoes are tumbling for Bobby.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You're sick too...he loved to do things to
dialog: me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up
dialog: cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She
dialog: become alcoholic...and the funny thing is--
dialog: I liked it. I liked being controlled by
dialog: Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as
dialog: he got, I wanted more. I wanted to go all
dialog: the way. Women say they don't want to be
dialog: taken like, really taken -- that's bullshit
dialog: -- they do. The first time he finished with
dialog: me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14.
dialog: Then he started crying like a baby...wanted
text: me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to
dialog: hate someone so much for so many years, but
dialog: still want to hold him, comfort him... They
dialog: found my Mom right down there (points) at
text: the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus
text: needles stuck all over her body and
dialog: Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk
dialog: and went insane. But I'll never believe she
text: ran off that cliff by accident. She was
dialog: born on this earth and she loved it. She
dialog: was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
text: Bobby is quietly stunned. A whole world has opened up to him;
text: and he isn't sure yet where the story ends. There is some force
dialog: at work here, beyond his control.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: After he got his divorce, he forced me to
dialog: marry him...but when I saw her body, I
dialog: swore to her on my soul that some day I'd
dialog: get Jake for what he did to her...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?
dialog: (shrugs, stoic) Have you ever been to
dialog: California?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah.
text: GRACE (as if in a dream)
dialog: Is it far from here?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Is it pretty?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches.
dialog: Blue water and clear skies as far as you
dialog: can see.
dialog: GRACE (like a little girl)
dialog: Would you take me with you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY (pause)
dialog: I wish I could.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we
dialog: get there you can dump me. I don't care. I
dialog: just want to get out of here.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Honey, baby, I can't. I can't even get out
dialog: of here myself. Believe it or not, I need a
dialog: lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car
dialog: back from that crazy mechanic...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Darrell? You know he and Jake are...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You don't have any money put away, do you?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at
dialog: a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't
dialog: want me goin' anywhere...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: ...you could get me money. I'll get you
dialog: out of here.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: There's money. A lot.
text: The words hang there, thick between them.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In
text: the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit
dialog: there and count it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: At night. He just sits there and laughs and
dialog: talks to himself and counts it. I heard
dialog: him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert
dialog: thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
text: Bobby's eyes widen in hope.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: In cash?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He
dialog: don't trust banks. He keeps the money in
text: the floor right under the bed. He loves it
dialog: so much, he wouldn't think of spending any
dialog: of it on me. I never seen it but I know
dialog: he's got more than a hunnert thousand at
dialog: least...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: One-hundred-thousand!? That son-of-a-bitch.
speaker_heading: GRACE (puzzled)
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: BOBBY (ignoring her)
dialog: If it's in a safe we'd have to get the
dialog: combination--
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: It takes a key. He keeps it on himself all
dialog: the time. I mean all the time. It
dialog: scratches up against me when we do it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Kill him.
text: Spoken almost innocently, it hangs there between them. A
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's
dialog: had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he
dialog: wouldn't even have to feel it...
dialog: (seductively) I mean, sometime in the
text: middle of the night, when it's quiet...when
dialog: he's asleep, you could just come up behind
dialog: him when he's pounding on me and...
text: Grace lays her hands on Bobby, starting to caress him. He
text: bristles and freezes with fear and disgust.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Shit! Listen to you... Are you crazy,
dialog: Grace?
text: He abruptly pulls away.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Jesus Christ! I think this place is making
dialog: me crazy. I was crazy to come back here and
dialog: see you. I'm crazy for listening to anyone
dialog: in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy
dialog: if I spent another minute with you.
text: Grace rises, covering her nakedness, shooting a hand to his
text: face, like she did when she read his fortune.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: But it's in you, Bobby. I see it. I see
dialog: Death. It's in your heart. Let it out for
dialog: me. Let it out...
text: He's mesmerized. Then:
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Do it for me, Bobby, you'll never regret
dialog: it. I promise you. I'll do anything for
dialog: you. Anything.
text: Bobby pauses, terribly torn.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I...take me back to town...
text: He turns away, towards the jeep. Grace has a tone of desperation
text: in her voice.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You need the money, Bobby. It's a lot more
dialog: than $100,000. A lot more. How are you
dialog: going to get out of here? You need the
dialog: money. Whatever it takes, Bobby, remember?
text: Bobby walks past the jeep, on his way back to town alone.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Where you going? I'll give you the
dialog: ride...Come back! Bobby? It's three miles.
text: Bobby doesn't look back. Her eyes drift backwards into her
dialog: solitude.
speaker_heading: GRACE (to herself)
dialog: Bobby?...Whatever it takes.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT/ALONG THE ROAD - LATER DAY
text: BOBBY walks through the desert parallel to the road, still in a
text: rage. Desert insects produce a cacophony of drones, buzzes, and
text: clicks. A rattlesnake darts off a rock into the brush. A VOICE
text: whispers to him.
speaker_heading: JAKE (V.O.)
dialog: You've got the killing in you, boy.
text: Bobby turns and looks around. Just desert. He continues.
speaker_heading: JAKE (V.O.)
dialog: Next time you'll do just fine.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No!
text: The screen burns a bright white.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
text: In a news pot, further down the street from where he was first
text: seen, the old, BLIND MAN sits with his dead DOG, speaking as if
text: into camera, sipping on a Dr. Pepper.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: It's the desert that makes you crazy. The
dialog: loneliness out here. Nobody to talk to.
text: People on the run. Trailer parks. White
dialog: trash. I seen some peculiar things on a hot
dialog: day. I seen a scorpion sting itself to
text: death. It just keeps driving its tail into
text: its body again and again. A little killer
text: killing itself. Seen a coyote kill itself
text: too. Just kept on biting and tearing at
text: its own legs. Near tore one clean off
dialog: before it bled to death. And what a white
dialog: man'll do when it's freezing one moment,
dialog: hot as hell the next. A man could get
dialog: hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders
text: with another (smacking his lips) kiss kissy
dialog: kiss. Nice pussy y'see, see it coming. I
dialog: don't know what it is about the desert. I
dialog: figger it's sort of like putting a kettle
text: of water over a fire. People is mostly
dialog: water. We boil when it's hot. 'Cept when
dialog: we boil the water's got no place to go. It
dialog: just churns inside of us until we can cool
dialog: off. If it's not too late.
text: BOBBY is now revealed standing next to the blind man, and we
text: realize the blind man has been talking to him all along. Bobby
text: sips a Dr. Pepper as well.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I
dialog: can't see.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That a fact?
text: Bobby noticing now all the little NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that the
text: Blind Man keeps around him in a sort of inchoate stall.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: I can see just fine. For example: You're
text: a young man who thinks he's got someplace
dialog: to be.
text: A POLICE RADIO crackles, Bobby tensing.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Maybe I do.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Or maybe you just think you do. Just
dialog: another small town. One guy chasing you.
dialog: You go big town. Just gonna have four guys
dialog: after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets
dialog: down to one thing -- are you a human being
dialog: or are you one of those hungry ghosts out
dialog: there never satisfied with nothing? Cause
dialog: you gotta remember you can run just as far
dialog: as you can, but wherever you go, that's
dialog: where you gonna be.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I think I've heard that before.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: What do you want for free?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Seems like I do but only cause end of the
dialog: day we're all eyes in the same head. And
dialog: everything is everything.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: ...And everything is nothing too.
text: BOBBY (shakes his head)
dialog: Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner
dialog: and spout wise.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Think you'll live that long?
text: Bobby is clearly unnerved by this. Suddenly the blind man
text: stands, pissed and powerful, sniffing the air with the police
text: radio in it.
text: As SHERIFF POTTER cruises by, glancing at Bobby shrinking. The
text: car goes on up the street.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you.
dialog: Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see
dialog: him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But
dialog: that ain't mean I don't know what's going
dialog: on around here. They're all cursed. Yes
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Who's cursed?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: All them miners last century. Hungry
text: ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at
dialog: the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think
dialog: I'm fooling around here. White sky was on
text: fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a
text: flash, then darkness descended upon me.
dialog: They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I
dialog: cursed them. White people can't seem to
text: stay away from Indians (grabs his bandaged
dialog: hand, smelling the blood). You gotta watch
dialog: where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy
text: pussy, Indian pussy.
text: It sounds demented. Bobby, checking him out to see if he's
text: really blind, walks quietly around him during this monologue and
text: peeks over his glasses trying to see the blind man's real eyes.
text: Although he thinks the Blind Man thinks he's on the other side
text: of him, the Blind Man fools him by suddenly swivelling around
text: and cranking a gob of spit into Bobby's face as if Bobby were on
text: the other side.
text: Bobby, pissed, wipes the spittle from his face.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN (finishing)
dialog: ...but they gotta know you don't fuck
dialog: around with Indians.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I thought you said you lost your eyes in
dialog: the war?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: So now you're going to tell me where I lost
dialog: my eyes. You don't think I know where I
dialog: lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them.
dialog: I lost them in the war. The war in the
dialog: joint. There's always wars in the joint.
dialog: Cause I was a code talker in the joint and
dialog: in the war too.(sniffs) Mmmm, nothing like
dialog: the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here
dialog: in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's
dialog: the curse. The mines done it. All that
dialog: uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium,
dialog: assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got
dialog: a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You
dialog: don't rip up the Earth and take everything
dialog: out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says,
dialog: "the more you eat, the more you
dialog: want...."...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I got things to do.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN (offended)
dialog: Oh well, go do 'em. You don't see me
dialog: stopping you...
text: Bobby starts to walk away. The Blind Man rattles his tin cup.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: ...But ain't you got a little something for
dialog: the infirm?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you
dialog: next time.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: BOBBY, depressed, is heading towards Harlin's gas station,
text: passing JENNY sitting on a corner drinking a soda, almost as if
text: waiting for him. She runs to him, and follows him, as somewhere
text: a POLICE RADIO crackles and buzzes.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted
dialog: to thank you.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: For defending my honor this afternoon.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I
dialog: wasn't defending you.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: But you was going to fight for me.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I wasn't going to fight for you. I was
dialog: just going to beat the shit out of your
dialog: boyfriend.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: He's not my boyfriend. I mean, I let him
dialog: take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken
dialog: for. Not yet that is.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Get it through your head, little girl; I'm
dialog: not going for you. If this Toby likes you,
dialog: then if I were you I'd marry him. You're
dialog: not going to get much better in this town.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: That's what I thought until you came riding
dialog: in. I saw your car over at the gas
dialog: station. It's a cool car. Want to take me
dialog: for a ride? Desert's kind of lonely this
dialog: time of day.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: How old are you?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in
dialog: two years, but that don't mean you can't
dialog: take me for a ride if you want.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, I don't want to take you for a ride.
dialog: What I want is for ... Hey, you don't
dialog: think you can get $150 from your parents,

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: That's right, Mister. You better be

dialog: I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.
dialog: Would you please tell him?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You're too late, Toby. We're going to get
dialog: in his fancy car and ride off and leave you
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What the hell are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: What's your name anyway?
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Oh, that tears it, Mister. I'm gonna bust
dialog: you up but good. I'm gonna bust you into a
dialog: million pieces and then ... and then bust
dialog: those pieces up, and then ... and then
dialog: spread them all around. That's what I'm
dialog: gonna do. You don't know what you're
dialog: dealing with, Mister. I'm crazy. I'm
dialog: psycho crazy.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, I know. You're TNT. Just like
dialog: dynamite. When you go off somebody gets
dialog: hurt. (at his wit's end) All right. Let's
dialog: do this.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you
dialog: beat him all up and knock out all his teeth
text: and he's just drooling and bleeding all
dialog: over hisself, 'cause we love each other and
dialog: we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his
dialog: love child.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Will you shut up!
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You gonna pay for that, Mister.
text: Toby and Bobby square off, sizing each other up and preparing
text: for a violent confrontation. Just as the two are about to clash
text: we hear the voice of SHERIFF POTTER from OFF CAMERA.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF(O.C.)
dialog: Toby!
text: The two men freeze in their tracks, as Potter drives up fast.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Hey, Sheriff Potter.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF (tough)
dialog: Toby, I just came from your mother's place.
dialog: She's worried sick about you. She says she
dialog: ain't seen you since this morning.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: That ain't true, Sheriff. I was home for
dialog: lunch.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Boy, I'm not trying to hear nothing from
dialog: you except that you're heading home. Now
dialog: run along.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yes, sir. Come on, Jenny.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: I want to stay.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I said come on!
text: Toby grabs Jenny by the wrist and literally pulls he along. As
text: she goes she yells back to Bobby.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Bye, Mister. Don't go nowhere without me.
dialog: I wanna have your love child.
text: Toby points a vicious finger at Bobby.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Next time, Mister. Next time.
text: Toby and Jenny exit leaving Bobby and the Sheriff alone. Bobby
dialog: would also like to exit fast.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Where ya goin'?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Harlin's.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Get in.
text: Bobby has no choice. He gets in.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Seen you popping up a little bit of
dialog: everywhere today. You're not planning on
dialog: staying are you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if
dialog: that's what you're worried about.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: That's a nasty cut you got there.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad
text: as it looks.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
text: There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's
dialog: today when it got hit. Way she tells it he
dialog: got whacked around good by one of the
text: robbers.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sounds like it. I wish I could help
dialog: Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and
dialog: get on up the road.
text: JAKE drives up in his GOLD CADDY. His windows whirr down.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Everything all right, Virgil?
text: He eyes Bobby.
dialog: SHERIFF (a little nervous)
dialog: Just fine, Jake. Where you going?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I was just up at Darrell's. How's the wife?
dialog: That little eskimo baby walkin' yet?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Oh just fine.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You haven't seen Grace around, have you?
dialog: I'm looking for her.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: No. But if I do, I'll tell her you're
text: looking for her, Jake.
text: JAKE (looking at Bobby)
dialog: Whatcha got there, some trash?
text: He drives off. The Sheriff drives on.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
text: Peculiar, how things happen. A man's car
text: breaks down. There's a hold up. People die
dialog: and all that money -- and now old Jake out
dialog: looking for his young wife. And then you
dialog: show up...
text: The Sheriff looks right through Bobby, who knows this is more
text: than a conversation. He pulls up to Harlin's garage. Bobby gets
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Time's running out, son. I'll be seeing you
dialog: in the morning...
text: With this thinly veiled threat, the Sheriff drives on. As Bobby
text: watches, feeling the pressure to get out now while he can.
scene_heading: EXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - LATER DAY
text: DARRELL is cleaning his tools. Bobby's MUSTANG sits prominently
text: in the car bay, washed and gleaming, as BOBBY walks up.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Hey there. I was beginnin' to think you
dialog: wasn't comin' back... You don't look so
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a
dialog: bit.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: One of those days you feel like you been
dialog: runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer
dialog: to where you tryin' to get than when you
dialog: started?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You've been there?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade
dialog: with a whippin' dog. Ain't much you can do
dialog: when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You believe that?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: You think bad, and bad is what you get.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: No charge.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty
dialog: bucks for the car, as soon as I get where
dialog: I'm going I swear I'll--
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Two-hundred.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You said this morning the hose was going to
dialog: run me one-fifty.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Yep. For the hose. But while you was gone
dialog: I replaced a gasket. That's going to run
dialog: you another fifty.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Yeah, but it was shot.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to
dialog: do it! You can't just do unauthorized
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Well, now, you just know all there is about
dialog: bein' a mechanic, don't you? Didn't you
text: read the sign.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What sign?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do
dialog: unauthorized work? What am I suppose to
dialog: do? Just let you ride out of here with a
dialog: bad gasket. Then you get in an accident
dialog: and get killed. Or worse. Who they gonna
dialog: blame then? They gonna blame me, and there
dialog: goes my reputation.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What reputation? You're nothing but an
text: ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Is that an insult? Are you insulting me.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe
dialog: me money, and this car ain't going nowheres
dialog: until I get it. And if you take another
dialog: five hours I'll find another fifty dollars
dialog: worth of work to do on it. Is that clear?
dialog: Now get out of here 'fore I call the
dialog: Sheriff, who knows me.
text: Bobby is in a rage. He turns to leave and walks a few paces.
text: He sees a WRENCH lying on a table. For a second his mind reels,
text: then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to smash it down
text: on Darrell's head. He stops cold. Because ol' Darrell holds a
text: CROWBAR in a batter's stance ready to smash it onto the Mustang.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: You want to play, Mister? I'll play with
dialog: you. You want to smash something? So do
dialog: I.
text: Darrell pulls back the crowbar, ready to swing.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No! Okay! Okay!
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: What's the matter? The fight gone out of
dialog: you? I'm just gonna smash a headlight.
dialog: Maybe two.
text: BOBBY (pleading, almost crying)
dialog: Please, just leave the car alone!
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Mister, you already pissed me off but good.
text: Darrell lays the tip of the crowbar on the hood of the car, and
text: drags the tip of the bar across the hood leaving a long scratch.
dialog: BOBBY (about to lose it)
dialog: Goddamn you! You son of a bitch!
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: There you go, sweet talking me again.
text: Darrell begins to laugh. Bobby, desperate, looks to the trunk,
text: thinking of his gun in there.
text: His POV -- the trunk. A FLASHBACK of the GUN goes through his
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Look, Harlin.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Darrell.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just
dialog: have to get something out of the trunk.
text: Using his TRUNK KEY, he tries to open it but realizes the lock
dialog: has been changed.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to
dialog: pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk
dialog: key.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: And you had to go into the trunk, didn't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: When I work on a car, I work on a car.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (snaps)
dialog: You motherfucker! (etc.)
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: You can't help yourself, can you mister?
dialog: You're out of control.
text: Darrell starts to laugh. It is a repetitive, almost demonic
text: laugh that grows louder as the camera slowly dollies in on
text: Bobby's anguished face.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: As BOBBY steps out into the glaring sun, he notices down at the
text: other end of the town, GRACE'S JEEP parked right outside the
text: SHERIFF'S OFFICE, empty.
text: Presently, GRACE and the SHERIFF walk out TALKING, and she gets
text: in, says a few last words and drives away.
text: Bobby backs around a corner into a sidestreet. Is she selling
text: him out? He's very confused, turbulent.
scene_heading: INT. BUS DEPOT - LATER DAY
text: BOBBY enters the BUS DEPOT. The interior is poorly lit. There
text: are a few benches for people to wait on, but they sit empty.
text: Old, faded travel posters hang on the wall. A bored FEMALE
text: CLERK is behind the counter.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I need a ticket.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Out of here.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: But, in particular?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I ... Mexico. You got a bus that goes to
dialog: Mexico? That's where I have to go.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico
dialog: would you like--
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't care, just get me there.
text: The clerk is a little put off by Bobby. He seems delirious. She
text: goes through her schedule looking for a bus.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a
dialog: local, arrives in two hours, and transfer
dialog: in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the
dialog: border.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: One way, or round trip?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: One way.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: 30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
text: Bobby counts his money.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Twenty-seven, fifty. That's all I got.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: The ticket is 30.55.
text: BOBBY (rifling his pockets)
dialog: I bought a beer. That was a dollar
dialog: something. Then I gave that girl 25 cents
dialog: for the juke box. And the blind man...the
dialog: soda...I..I'd have 30 if...if...
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I'm sorry, sir. It's $30.55 for the
dialog: ticket.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (to himself)
dialog: Yeah. Just a little short. Figures. I
dialog: just wanted to get out, that's all.
text: Bobby starts to walk away. Suddenly he turns, runs back at the
text: clerk, proffers his money, half-crazed, near tears.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Please, ma'am, you don't understand! I have
dialog: to get out of here. They're going to come
dialog: looking for me. They're going to kill me.
dialog: If I can't get this ticket then I'm going
dialog: to have to do things to get out of here.
dialog: You know what I mean! I don't want to hurt
dialog: anybody, I just want to leave. Please. I
dialog: can't...I can't.
text: He's so desperate and in her frightened but neutral expression,
text: Bobby experiences the only compassion he ever finds in this
dialog: whole town.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Okay, I'll give you the ticket, sir,
dialog: but...just...just, please calm down,
dialog: please!
text: her sane tone reminds Bobby of how far down he's come. He
text: shrinks, suddenly ashamed of himself. She takes the cash on the
text: counter, hands him a ticket.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Keep your change. Bus three-twenty-three.
dialog: Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm sorry. It's just ... you know ...
text: She nods, puts a "closed" sign in the ticket window, disappears.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS DEPOT - LATE DAY
text: We hear the crackle of the same POLICE RADIO again, OFF CAMERA,
text: as BOBBY walks out of the depot. ticket preciously held in his
text: hand, and suddenly reels as he sees SERGEI, about a 100 yards
text: down the main stretch, slowly rolling into town in his
text: convertible, looking for guess who.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Holy shit!
scene_heading: INT. SERGEI'S CAR - SIMULTANEOUS
text: BOBBY turns away, but not fast enough. SERGEI spots him, hits
dialog: the pedal.
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: Got you, shitface! Bobby Cooper. Bobby
dialog: Cooper...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - SIMULTANEOUS
text: BOBBY, ducking around a corner, hears the brief "Whoop" of the
text: sheriff's POLICE SIREN. He glances back.
text: His POV - sure enough, the SHERIFF'S having a field day. He's
text: just pulled SERGEI over. At this distance, we catch snippets of
text: conversation as the Sheriff ambles from his car, checking
text: Sergei's out-of-state plates.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how
dialog: they work things in Nevada, but we got
dialog: speed limits in this state.
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am
dialog: looking town. I not even moving.
text: We pop in closer to their conversation -- Bobby relishing this
text: in his mind's eye. Sergei is constantly looking off to where he
text: last saw Bobby. But the Sheriff, strangely, pays no attention to
dialog: these looks.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Whoa, what kind of accent you got there?
dialog: You one of them Russians?
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: I am Russian, da! I am also rich Russian,
dialog: da? Maybe we work something out, my friend
dialog: Sheriff?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just
dialog: cause you Russians ain't commies anymore,
dialog: don't think money can buy everything...
text: Down the street, Sheriff Potter is holding up a concealed GUN.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
text: What's that? (He grabs the gun)
dialog: ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this
dialog: town, Ivan. You know anything about
dialog: Jamilla's grocery store?
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: What fuckin grocery store, you fucking
dialog: shithead idiot! You call yourself a
dialog: police...
text: Sergei looking Bobby's direction.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Get out of the car, spread them. You can
dialog: jawbone all you want or you have the right
dialog: to shut the fuck up! You commie
dialog: motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to
dialog: the can.
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: I want my lawyer!
text: Sheriff cuffs Sergei and sticks him in the police car.
text: Bobby can't help smiling as he turns away to the SODA MACHINE
text: seen in an earlier scene.
text: He comes up with the change the bus clerk left him and, dying
text: for a drink in this heat, inserts the coin. Though still under
dialog: considerable pressure from all sides, this lucky break with
text: Sergei seems like it might be the beginning of something new
dialog: today -- some luck.
text: The icy cold soda bottle shoots out. Bobby raises it to his
text: lips, about to taste it, about to relax for once. Violently it
text: explodes out of his hands as he doubles over in blinding pain
text: from a KIDNEY PUNCH. He stumbles forward into the soda machine,
text: gasping. The legs of his assailant are close to him, but the
text: face is unseen.
text: Bobby doubles his agony as his bandaged left stump takes the
text: brunt of the blow into the machine, re-opening the wound. Blood
text: starts to seep through the bandage.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Ow!
text: Bobby crumples to the ground as TOBY now towers over him with
text: his fists curled and a snarl on his lips.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Get up, Mister! Don't ever let it be said
dialog: Toby Tucker beat the living shit out of
dialog: someone without giving them a fair chance.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (gasping)
dialog: What the hell are you doing? You fucking
dialog: psycho!
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I'm doing what any man would do if he'd
dialog: been offended. I'm stompin' your ass.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You idiot! You don't even know what you're
dialog: fighting over!
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.
dialog: Now get up off the ground, or do I have to
dialog: whoop you where you lie?
text: JENNY comes running up the street.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Toby! Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: You stay away, Jenny. I aim to mess him
dialog: up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to
dialog: see.
text: Jenny runs to Bobby and cuddles him where he lays.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Don't be afraid of him none. I don't care
dialog: what he does to you, we can still be
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Get away from me!
text: Bobby sees his bus ticket on the ground. He grabs for it, but
text: Toby beats him to it.
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Now, what's this?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Give it to me!
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Mexico? You going to Mexico?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm leaving. You never have to see me
dialog: again. Just please, give me the ticket!
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: This means something to you? Jenny means
dialog: something to me.
text: Toby sticks the ticket in his mouth and chews it up whole.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Nooo!
speaker_heading: TOBY (between bites)
dialog: I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be
dialog: eatin' nothing but soup the erst of your
dialog: days. Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than
dialog: you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up
dialog: so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.
dialog: I'm gonna ...
text: Toby's words drift to Bobby from a million miles away. The
text: world around him is like a dream, or a nightmare. A primal rage
text: wells inside of Bobby that rises up in a howl as he swings the
text: soda bottle up out of nowhere across Toby's head, smashing him
text: backwards. Then he lands blow after blow with his right hand on
text: the boy's face and head.
dialog: Jenny screams:
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: Stop it! You're killing him!
text: Jenny grabs Bobby's arm, literally hanging all her weight on it,
text: stopping him from striking Toby again.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You're killing him! Toby!? Toby!?
text: Jenny sinks to the ground and cuddles Toby. Bobby stands. He
text: looks at Toby, then at his bloodied knuckles in disbelief. His
text: bandage is soaked with his own blood, but his adrenaline numbs
dialog: the pain.
speaker_heading: JENNY
dialog: You killed him! You killed him!
text: She wails in the background as he backs away, around the corner,
text: into Main Street, crossing to where the PHONE BOOTH is.
scene_heading: EXT. PHONE BOOTH - LATE DAY
text: BOBBY is on the phone.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hello, Grace? It's Bobby.
scene_heading: INTERCUTS TO:
scene_heading: INT. MCKENNA HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS
text: GRACE, in the kitchen, is also on the phone.
speaker_heading: GRACE (coolly)
dialog: I thought you'd be on your way to Vegas by
dialog: now. Is there something you wanted?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I wanted to talk.
speaker_heading: GRACE(V.O.)
dialog: I don't think we have anything to talk
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What about us?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: There is no us, remember?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Except I can't get you out of my head,
dialog: Grace.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Stop it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (V.O.)
dialog: Why? Am I making you hot, or does the
dialog: truth scare you?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Because I know you're full of shit.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I mean it, Grace. I'm getting out of here,
dialog: and I want to take you with me.
speaker_heading: GRACE (V.O.)
dialog: I thought you couldn't get your car.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I could if I had Jake's money.
speaker_heading: GRACE (V.O.)
dialog: Is that what changed your mind? The money?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't give a damn about the money. I
dialog: want you, and I want to get us out of this
dialog: shithole. There's only one way to do that.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Are you sure?... About me, I mean?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I came back for you; this morning I came
dialog: back. Before I even knew about the money.
dialog: You're what I want.
dialog: (then)
dialog: The only reason I stormed off is because
dialog: you spooked me talking about Jake. But
dialog: I've had nothing but time to think about
dialog: it. It keeps coming back to you and me and
dialog: us getting the hell out of here. But we've
dialog: got to get the money, baby. We get the
dialog: money, I get the car, then we get the hell
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You said you couldn't kill anybody.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We don't have to kill him. Just knock him
dialog: out and tie him up 'till we get away.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It was your idea, remember? I'm doing this
dialog: for you. I'm doing this so you can
dialog: fly...fly like a bird.
text: Grace bites at a nail and fidgets, but says nothing.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (V.O.)
dialog: Grace ... Grace?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: After dark. I'll leave the back door
dialog: unlocked.
text: She quickly hangs up the phone.
text: Bobby also hangs up the phone, an unreadable expression on his
dialog: face.
scene_heading: INT. MCKENNA LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY
text: JAKE sits in an easy chair reading a paper. Puffs of smoke from
text: his pipe rise from behind the paper and hang like a cloud over
text: his head. GRACE stands in the doorway, body stiff and arms
text: crossed, staring at him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Who was that on the phone?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Wrong number.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You spent a long time talking for a wrong
dialog: number. But then you make friends so
dialog: easily. Don't you, Grace?
text: Grace has no answer for that, so she says nothing. A long
dialog: moment passes, then:
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I put up new drapes, Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I know. I was here when your apprentice
dialog: was helping you. Remember?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You never said anything. About the drapes.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: They look nice.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You haven't even looked at them once.
text: Jake lowers the paper, looks at the drapes.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: They look nice.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought
dialog: you would like the colors.
text: JAKE (softly, admiring)
dialog: You look just like your mama when you move
dialog: like that against the light.
text: Grace stares at the CHAIN now visible around Jake's neck that
text: disappears under his shirt. She knows that hidden there is a
text: key, and she fixes on it intently.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What the hell you looking at, girl?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - EVENING

scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Well, that's it. Sun's going down. People

dialog: They'll talk about the day, about the heat,

dialog: do it all over again.
text: BOBBY now appears next to the blind man holding two Dr. Peppers.

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: The day wasn't so bad. We all got through

scene_heading: BLIND MAN (giving back the change)
dialog: Keep it.

text: coming back with the night. His humour is enhanced by his POV
dialog: down the street:
text: As DARRELL, with his dilapidated truck, readies SERGEI'S
dialog: convertible for towing.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN (OVER)
dialog: Ain't over yet. Night is part of day;
dialog: separate, but equal. Night is when you let
dialog: your guard down; when you see things in the
text: shadows and hear things in the dark.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Difference between you and me, old man, is
dialog: I see the glass half full, you see it half
text: empty.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Night is when you want to sleep, but the
dialog: dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.
dialog: It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high
dialog: in the sky so you could see what it is
dialog: you're afraid of.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You afraid of the dark?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Afraid of it? Boy, I live in the dark. All
dialog: cause of a woman who made me this way.
text: People are afraid of what they can't see.
dialog: I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same
dialog: to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy
text: kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp,
text: slurp, the kiss of death (he makes a
dialog: strange sound). It's all the same to me.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: So, we're all just floating along like
dialog: twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. Is
dialog: that it?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: More or less.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Not this twig, friend. I got plans.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder
dialog: than a man's plans. We all got plans. I
dialog: planned on seeing all my life. I know you
dialog: didn't plan on straying into town.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No and I don't plan on sticking around
dialog: either.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Well, don't say I didn't warn you when
dialog: things go your way.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You got a lotta philosophy in you, old
dialog: timer but you don't fool me for one second
dialog: with all this blind man crap. One minute
dialog: you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's
dialog: the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to
dialog: you.
text: The Blind Man slowly lifts his glasses, showing his EYES at
text: last. Where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh. An ugly
text: sight that even takes Bobby back a step.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Used to be a young smartass like you. Then
dialog: I got smart with the wrong man's daughter.
dialog: Got some acid poured on my peepers for my
dialog: trouble. You know human beings ain't always
dialog: just human -- they got animals living
dialog: inside 'em too...People give spare change
dialog: to war heroes not fools. All fools get is
dialog: pity. May not have eyes, but I see. And
dialog: you, boy?
text: The Blind Man puts his glasses back on.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: You got my pity.
dialog: BOBBY (doesn't believe him)
dialog: Hope she was worth it.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Oh, she was worth it. She was worth every
dialog: black minute since.
text: Bobby looks at his watch, gets ready to go, drops a coin into
text: the Blind Man's cup.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Things ain't always the way they seem. You
dialog: got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day
dialog: comes Earthmaker is going to look in your
dialog: fucking heart! Then you better know what it
dialog: is you're doing. Are you a human being --
dialog: or just one of them hungry ghosts out there
dialog: floatin' around?
text: Bobby walks away, smiling.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You are crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: You know I won't be seeing you.
text: The Blind Man lifts his sunglasses and peers into the cup as if
text: he sees. We don't really know. He reaches into the cup and pulls
text: out the coin Bobby tossed in.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Cheap bastard. Gives me back my own
dialog: money... Well, Jesse, time's up, let's go
dialog: for a walk.
text: The Blind Man now stands up and pulls the seeing-eye dog's
text: harness. The DOG struggles to its feet and they walk off down
text: the street together.
scene_heading: INT. MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT
text: GRACE stands by the back door staring at the bolt lock. JAKE
text: yells to her from another room.
speaker_heading: JAKE(O.C.)
dialog: What the hell you doin', Grace? Are you
dialog: coming to bed, or aren't you?
text: For a moment Grace's hand wavers above the lock. Suddenly, like
text: a snake striking, her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt.
text: Just as quickly she turns from the door and heads to the
dialog: bedroom.
scene_heading: EXT. YARD - MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A LIGHT is on in the bedroom window. After a moment it dims and
text: the house is dark, silhouetted against the horizon by moonlight.
text: BOBBY steps into frame, carrying an iron pipe.
scene_heading: INT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
text: We start close on GRACE -- a KEY slapping against her buttocks
text: as bedsprings groan. We reveal Grace copulating on all fours
text: with JAKE from behind.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You
dialog: like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta
dialog: go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but
dialog: you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't
dialog: you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my
dialog: heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You
dialog: betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't
dialog: no forgivin' ya, girl!
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's
dialog: heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it
dialog: away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause
dialog: your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost
dialog: baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No! No! Please!
text: He hits her. Harder.
text: In a strange flashback of his mind, he now sees Grace's MAMA
text: beneath him, receiving his punishment.
text: He stops, abruptly. He can't go on. Fear coming into his eyes.
text: He starts to whimper, begging for his punishment and/or
dialog: forgiveness.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh baby, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry...
dialog: (he starts to cry)
dialog: I didn't mean to hurt you so bad. It
dialog: just...got away...
text: He drops down, burying his face between Grace's legs.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Forgive me, baby, forgive me!
text: He hides there from the world that he has created, crying to
dialog: himself.
text: Grace has an unreadable expression, but that's certainly not a
text: new occurrence in their strange relationship.
scene_heading: INT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BACKDOOR - NIGHT
text: The knob of the backdoor twists and the door opens. BOBBY slips
text: quickly through the space and into the house quietly closing the
text: door behind him. It is nearly pitch dark, and he has no
text: bearings. He steps gingerly through the hall, but in the
text: darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a lamp only
text: to catch it just before it crashes into the floor.
scene_heading: INT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
text: JAKE hears the noise. He raises his head and cocks an ear to
text: the air. She knows who it is, and is concerned; he's too early.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You didn't hear something?
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my
dialog: ass.
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: There's someone in the house.
speaker_heading: GRACE (nervous)
dialog: Maybe...maybe the wind blew something over
dialog: (encouraging him to continue). Come on
dialog: baby, keep going.
text: Jake climbs out of bed, throwing on some pants, reaching into a
text: drawer in the chest of clothes, pulling out a small dark
text: metallic OBJECT.
speaker_heading: GRACE (realizing)
dialog: What's that? Jake -- where's you get that?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Relax baby. Stay here.
text: He goes to the door. She follows, tries to block the door.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared
dialog: of things...
text: He maneuvers her aside and slips out the door into the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM/MCKENNA HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS
text: Crowbar in one hand, BOBBY makes his way slowly through the
text: living room, banging against the edge of a table. He hops
text: silently in pain, then waits at the door to the next room and
text: listens. Hearing nothing he slowly pokes his head into the
text: darkness. A moment later Bobby backs from the door and we see
text: the barrel of his own black .9mm BARETTA pressed against his
text: forehead. JAKE appears now, backing him into the living room.
text: He switches on a LAMP.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Well, well. As I live and breathe. I
dialog: didn't expect to be seeing the like of you
dialog: again. Thought you'd be long on your way
dialog: by now.
text: Jake continues to press the gun to Bobby's head.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's my gun...(then) That fucking
dialog: Darrell!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I like Darrell. He may be an idiot, but
dialog: he's my half brother. We own Harlin's
dialog: together, yeah, that little redneck manages
dialog: to get paid no matter how things work out.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (realizing)
dialog: You been workin' me the whole time.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I guess this is what they call "ironee"?
dialog: Hunh?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It's not what you think, Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No, but it don't matter anyway when you're
dialog: lying there with your brains all over my
dialog: carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about
dialog: this drifter, didn't have enough money to
dialog: fix his car. And Darrell happened to find
dialog: his gun, and through maybe this drifter
dialog: heard old Jake got some money stashed away,
text: and figgered he might try to break in and
dialog: steal it!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Wait a minute. Just listen to me...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: ...And he thought he'd clock old Jake
text: McKenna and turn his brains into wall
dialog: paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or
dialog: $20,000, or $200,000...
speaker_heading: BOBBY (very serious)
dialog: That's not the reason I'm here, Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: There's another reason? It better be good.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
text: GRACE makes her way down the hall in a nightgown, and now hides
text: in shadow, listening.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (V.O.)
dialog: I came for Grace.
speaker_heading: JAKE (V.O.)
dialog: You came to take my wife from me?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
speaker_heading: BOBBY (sincere)
dialog: No. I came to kill her.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: GRACE'S eyes get real narrow and angry.
speaker_heading: JAKE (V.O.)
dialog: Shhh! Liar.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (V.O.)
dialog: It's the truth, Jake.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's a thick change of heart from this
dialog: afternoon.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Maybe I don't like being played, like she
dialog: played us today. Maybe I don't like that
dialog: at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe
dialog: I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to
dialog: kill me, and if it comes down to me or
dialog: Grace, then I pick Grace. You were going
dialog: to give me thirteen-thousand. Give me
dialog: two-hundred. I'll kill her and dump the
dialog: body where no one will ever find it. She
dialog: showed me the perfect place. There won't be
dialog: enough left for an autopsy. But I need the
dialog: the money. I've got to have the money.
text: Jake is silent. He takes his time thinking. Finally:
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: She's in the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: GRACE, distressed, starts backing off towards the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: BOBBY stares at the automatic in JAKE's hand.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Wanna give me my gun?
text: Jake laughs, a "don't even think about it" look.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: A strangling'll do just fine. Go to work.
text: Bobby holds up his eight fingers with a "you try" look. Jake
text: shrugs. Bobby points to the crowbar on the carpet.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: How 'bout the pipe?
speaker_heading: JAKE (sarcastic)
text: She's got a slender neck.
text: Bobby turns and walks towards the bedroom. Jake follows into an
text: adjoining room.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hold on a second! Come here!
text: Bobby turns to Jake, who is suddenly extremely upset.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How the hell did you know where the
dialog: bedroom's at?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What are you talking about!
dialog: JAKE (getting closer)
dialog: This morning when I came in on you and
dialog: Grace, you swore you hadn't been near the
dialog: bedroom. Now you make straight for it.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: GRACE returns to listen. This thing is like a seesaw battle of
dialog: wills.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (V.O.)
dialog: Come on, Jake --
speaker_heading: JAKE (V.O.)
dialog: Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You
dialog: probably didn't even make it out to the
dialog: desert this afternoon...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: JAKE has come right up on BOBBY in a rage.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: ...Or did you just ply the afternoon away
dialog: between my sheets putting your lips all
dialog: over her, you little horndog...
speaker_heading: BOBBY (changing tactics)
dialog: What difference does it make if I slept
dialog: with her? We're gonna kill her.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You're right! I don't give a damn about
dialog: her. But killing her's one thing. Fucking
dialog: her behind my back, that's another!
text: Suddenly Jake swings his arm, clipping Bobby across the side of
text: the head with the pistol and opening another bloody gash.
text: Bobby crumbles to his knees, crying out.
text: Jake suddenly grabs Bobby by the hair, forcing his face back and
text: smearing his lips with his own in a vengeful kiss. The blood
text: from Bobby's wound runs down to his lips and mixes with Jake's
dialog: lips.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Now you've tasted both of us!
text: He pulls back the hammer on the gun and levels it at Bobby's
text: head. Bobby sees it coming, plays his last card on his knees.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: O.K.! I admit it! I fucked her! But it's
dialog: her you have to worry about, not me! She
dialog: wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead
dialog: and she wants your money.
speaker_heading: JAKE (hesitates)
dialog: What are you babbling about?
dialog: BOBBY (talking fast)
dialog: Think about it! How do you think I got in
dialog: here? Did you hear any glass break? Did you
dialog: hear a door splinter?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
text: GRACE listening.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (V.O.)
dialog: How did the evening end? After you went to
dialog: bed did she linger a bit? Maybe just long
dialog: enough to leave the door unlocked? Is that
dialog: what happened?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
text: Like an old rag, JAKE gradually soaks all this up becoming
text: heavier with the weight of the knowledge.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You'd tell me anything to save your
dialog: pathetic life.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake.
dialog: You know how badly she wants to get the
dialog: fuck out of Superior. What's she to you,
dialog: Jake; a woman who wants you dead? Let me
dialog: kill her. All I want is two-hundred
dialog: dollars to get out of here with.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Two-hundred dollars?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it! I'll
dialog: kill her!
text: A beat. Jake stares down at Bobby on the floor.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sweet Christ, I'd be doing the world a
dialog: favor, ridding it of the likes of you. Get
dialog: your miserable ass off the floor. You're
dialog: positively pathetic... Go on, go kill
dialog: Grace.
text: Bobby slowly stands.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm not letting you walk for nothing. Two
dialog: hundred dollars. Do it, boy. Kill her.
dialog: Bobby goes.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
text: GRACE bolts back to the bedroom, the camera following her as she
dialog: flies.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
text: BOBBY walks it. His POV -- the door. Every step seems freighted.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
text: GRACE is in a quandary. How many seconds before Bobby walks in
text: to kill her? Or can he really kill her? She's not sure.
text: She looks around the room frantically. Picks up a lamp, puts it
text: down. She looks quickly through her closet, rummages below in
text: the boxes. Suddenly she finds it.
text: A dangerous looking Indian HATCHET with a feather hanging off
text: its bindings. It's a formidable piece of iron, quite capable of
text: splitting a skull or impaling flesh.
text: Grace hears the footsteps just outside the door. She runs behind
text: the door.
text: A moment later, the bedroom door creaks open and BOBBY quietly
text: enters, approaching the bed. We sense the doubt in his eyes as
dialog: to whether he can kill her.
text: In a reverse POV, Bobby sees the outline of Grace in the bed as
text: victim...closer, closer. He now lifts the edge of the bedcover
text: but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure.
text: He suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her
text: presence. He spins.
text: She's directly behind him, hatchet raised. His life is in her
dialog: hands.
text: His eyes, locked in an eternal moment.
text: Her eyes, the hatchet.
speaker_heading: SNAP CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
text: As JAKE, anxiously torn, waits, there is a LOUD CRASH, followed
text: by SOUNDS of struggle, of murder, of death. Then...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Jake!
text: It is a desperate cry for help. Jake can't help himself. He
text: breaks into a roaring run down the hall to save his beloved.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Grace!!
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
text: JAKE bulls into the bedroom. It's a mess, furniture overturned,
text: sheets and blankets all over the floor. The lights broken.
text: Waiting for him, face down on the floor, is BOBBY'S BODY in a
text: pool of liquid. A broken bottle lies nearby. Bobby's body heaves
text: in its final death throes, and then shudders quiet... Over
text: there, by the bed, is GRACE, who still clutches the HATCHET.
text: The look on her face is pure shock.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Well...looks like you got him, Grace.
dialog: That's good...that's real good. He must of
dialog: slipped past me, but you got him. Looks
dialog: like that drifter from this morning. Got
dialog: to be careful who you make friends with,
dialog: sweetheart.
text: Jake eyes the weapon in Grace's hand.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why don't you put that down? It's all over
dialog: now. Put it down.
text: Grace eyes the gun in Jake's hand.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Go on, girl. Put it down.
text: What choice does Grace have? She lets the hatchet clank to the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Aww, that's my Grace: Not about to let
dialog: someone get the best of her. That's what I
dialog: love about you. As dangerous as you are
dialog: unpredictable.
text: behind Jake, the lifeless BOBBY rises up from the floor, very
text: much alive, and clobbers Jake with a golf club. Jake is
text: staggered, but he's one tough old customer as he manages to spin
text: slowly, gun still in one hand, as if to fire.
text: Before he can, Grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and
text: drives it straight into his back.
text: He gurgles, stunned from both sides, but it's like trying to
text: kill Rasputin. He still has the gun as Bobby jumps him from the
text: rear, trying to get his neck in a chokehold. The gun FIRES once,
text: discharging into the wall. The hatchet is ripped from his back.
text: Grace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged
text: rodeo-type fight, Jake seeking to dislodge Bobby off his back.
text: An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes.
text: Finally the two men go crashing to the ground, rolling around,
text: Bobby maintaining his stranglehold, but calling to her, his
text: hands full.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Grace, goddamit, do something!
text: Jake's eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale, pleading for
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Grace...?
text: She commits. Jumping into the fray, it's not clear whose side
text: she's really on as the three of them roll across the floor,
text: strangling, biting, hitting, spitting, scratching, gasping. It's
text: a Guignol, but the pressure from Bobby's forearm is taking its
text: toll on Jake. Trying to bite Jake, Grace bites Bobby instead,
text: but then she scratches Jake's face. Jake is grabbing her hard as
text: Bobby chokes him, trying to use her to leverage himself away.
text: But she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on
text: her knees across the floor.
text: She grabs the hatchet. And stands, moving back towards the two
text: men locked on the floor. Bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand,
text: no longer sure which way she'll go.
text: Jake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping
text: from his mouth, looks at Grace with some inner certainty that
text: she will help him. He gasps the words.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Help me, Grace, help...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Like you helped her, Jake?
text: Grace stands there, deciding, the power of the hatchet in her
text: hands. She raises it suddenly over the two men.
text: It flashes downwards. Deep into the gut of her husband Jake,
text: almost transfixing him to the floor.
text: In the silence that follows, Jake's eyes roll up to meet hers.
text: But all she has for him is a cold, distant stare.
text: Jake's head drops as the life rushes out of him. Bobby falls
text: back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What the hell'd you wait for?
text: She doesn't answer, turbulence in her face. He rolls Jake's body
text: off, upset. She may have made it a murder, but he was part of
text: it, and he feels the shift in himself. They're both in new
text: territory, feeling an apartness between them.
text: Suddenly JAKE gasps, still alive! It is too much for Bobby. He
text: grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on Jake, silencing him one
dialog: last time.
text: Grace is pushing the bed away from the wall, slipping down on
text: her knees and prying open several floorboards.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: The money's right here! Get the key!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No! You get it!
text: He doesn't want to get close to Jake. Grace coldly runs over to
text: his corpse, ripping the chain, key and all, from the neck. The
text: action pulls Jake's head up, then she lets it thump back on the
text: floor. She runs back to the floorboards.
text: The top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed.
text: Bobby watches -- his whole life, it seems, hanging on the
dialog: outcome.
text: With the key, she opens the safe. Inside are rolled-up bundles
text: of cash -- in hundred dollar denominations. She looks up at him,
text: offering it as she reaches in for more. Bobby also gets down on
text: his hands and knees and grabs more and more, sucked into the
dialog: fever of freedom, far more money than he lost at the grocery
text: store, overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom.
text: They see each other.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Didn't I tell you?
text: BOBBY (plunging into the cash)
dialog: There must be 150, 200 thousand here!
dialog: Goddamnit Grace, you were right!
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: We done it, Bobby. Oh my God!
text: They laugh excitedly and start kissing, rolling in the stacks of
text: cash, some of which sticks to Bobby's sweating back. The day
dialog: didn't turn out so bad after all for Bobby.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Fuck me baby!
text: BOBBY (looking at Jake)
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Let him watch. I want him to know what he's
dialog: missing.
text: As they consummate their violent relationship for the first
text: time, Jake's lifeless eyes watch them.
scene_heading: EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER NIGHT
text: The LIGHT in the bedroom window is low candlelight, but we sense
text: something watching them. GRACE's silhouette moves across a
dialog: window.
text: BOBBY now comes out of the house, cautious, walking down the
dialog: driveway.
text: He stops, thinks, and walks back to open the hood of GRACE'S JEEP.
text: He reaches into the ENGINE and disconnects something, then
text: closes the hood and walks on.
scene_heading: EXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - NIGHT
text: BOBBY walks up to the SHACK near the garage and bangs on the
text: door. A light goes on in the window. DARRELL shouts out.
speaker_heading: DARRELL (O.C.)
dialog: What you want?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Open up!
speaker_heading: DARRELL (O.C.)
dialog: We're closed. Come back when the sun comes
dialog: up.
text: Bobby, in a hurry to get back should Grace pull any tricks,
text: bangs and kicks against the door. Darrell yanks the door wide.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: What the hell ... oh, it's you. Might've
dialog: figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming
dialog: over. What do you want?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I want my car.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: You got the money?
text: Bobby pulls the money from his hip pocket and hands it to
text: Darrell. The mechanic fingers it suspiciously.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar
dialog: bills. And this morning you was broke.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's none of your business. Get the keys.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: I don't want no dirty money. I run an
dialog: honest business.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
speaker_heading: DARRELL (pause)
dialog: Well, there's a $50 overnight storage
dialog: charge we got to talk about.
text: Bobby is ready at first to explode, but then just laughs out
text: loud. You got to give it to a guy like Darrell. He holds up a
dialog: $100 bill.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how
dialog: much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
text: Bobby pulls the hundred back from Darrell's grasp.
dialog: DARRELL (going to get the keys)
dialog: Don't know nothing about no gun.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Course you don't. Tell me something
dialog: Darrell. Forty thousand people die every
dialog: day! How come none of them are you?
text: DARRELL (throws him the keys)
dialog: I think you know where to find her.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: And the trunk key.
text: DARRELL (pulls out the trunk key)
dialog: Topped off the tank for you. No charge.
dialog: Just my way of doing business.
text: BOBBY (jovial, confident now)
dialog: Listen up good, Darrell. I'm getting outta
dialog: this shithole. You're staying! And one
dialog: little peep outta you -- remember that gun
dialog: makes you part of the food chain. Your
dialog: prints are all over it. I'd be awful
dialog: careful whose rectum I was pointing my
dialog: finger in, Darrell.
text: Bobby hops in the car, a free man. As Darrell glares at him,
text: bewildered and frightened at the same time.
scene_heading: EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT
text: BOBBY turns the MUSTANG up the drive. THE HEADLIGHTS cut the
text: darkness and land on an empty patch where Grace's jeep had been
text: parked. Bobby jumps from the Mustang and runs around
text: frantically. His look is devastated. He falls to his knees,
dialog: about to sob when:
text: GRACE opens the front door and pokes her head out, putting out
text: several suitcases.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Bobby? What the hell's the matter with
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on
text: a rock. Hurt like hell.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I got the money all packed. I put the jeep
dialog: and his caddy in the garage. People'll
dialog: think maybe me and Jake went away. Buy us
dialog: some time...I know a back road we can take.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: Good thinking. (looking at her four bags)
dialog: What's all this?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm not coming back.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (accepting)
dialog: Awright, let's go. I want to be fifty miles
text: from here before the sun comes up.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Funny thing; the jeep wouldn't start. I had
dialog: to push it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (dryly)
dialog: Funny thing... I'll get the bags.
scene_heading: EXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER NIGHT
text: Bobby's MUSTANG is backed towards the front of the house. We
text: see a silhouette of BOBBY and GRACE carrying something wrapped
text: in a BLANKET and dumping it in the trunk.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: A lone pair of HEADLIGHTS illuminate the night as the Mustang
text: cruises through the dark. As the lights brighten the screen we:
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. MUSTANG - NIGHT
text: GRACE sits next to BOBBY peering out the windshield, clutching
text: the money in a backpack. She's humming an Indian song.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I can't see it.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It should be just up ahead. Hold on ...
dialog: there! There it is!
text: A SIGN illuminated by the HEADLIGHTS. It reads: YOU ARE
scene_heading: LEAVING SUPERIOR. THANKS FOR VISITING.
text: Grace lets out a scream of joy, leans over and hugs him.
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: Oh, God! I can't believe it. I'm out.
dialog: I'm finally out!
text: The MUSTANG begins to swerve along the road.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Hey! Take it easy. Want to get us killed?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You don't know what it feels like to be
dialog: free of that place.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't know about that?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my
dialog: entire life there. I feel like someone just
dialog: took a million pounds off my shoulders.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I want a place where only the vultures will
dialog: find him...(then) It'll be over soon,
dialog: Grace.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Then will you take me on your friends' boat
dialog: with you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'm not sailing his boat.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: But I thought --
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We're going to buy a boat of our own baby,
dialog: and sail it wherever we want to go.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Anywhere?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've
dialog: dreamed of going there and just lying on
text: the beach while the water licked up against
dialog: my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You already have.
text: She gives him a funny look.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You know I thought you'd left me back
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BOBBY (emotional)
dialog: When I got back from the garage, and your
dialog: jeep wasn't there, I thought you'd gone and
dialog: left me and taken the money.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: ...Cause I never had any luck with women,
dialog: Grace. You don't know what I been through.
dialog: The shit I've taken. I thought you were
dialog: like the rest of 'em... but when you came
dialog: out of the house... well you're here Grace
dialog: and we might be starting in the shit but
dialog: we're starting where I never been --
dialog: together with someone -- together with you
dialog: Grace.
text: She responds with a luminous smile.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I love you Bobby.
text: He looks back at her with trust and love in his eyes.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We're gonna pull this off, Grace.
text: Just then a HEADLIGHT rakes them from the rear as we hear,
text: again, the ominous crackle of a POLICE RADIO and the short
text: brutal "Whoop" of the siren, as Sheriff Potter's VEHICLE rolls
text: up quickly behind them. Grace's face is caught like a surprised
text: deer in the headlamps.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh, my God!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Don't stop!
text: Bobby is in a bind. The siren whoops again. The lights flash to
text: highbeam.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: He must've seen us swerving on the road,
dialog: that's all, just gonna give us a ticket for
dialog: swerving...
text: But even Bobby has trouble believing that as the POLICE VEHICLE
text: pulls out sharply alongside his and SHERIFF POTTER motions to
text: him aggressively to pull over on the shoulder.
text: SHERIFF (into loudspeaker)
dialog: Pull over, goddamnit, pull over!
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Keep going!
text: She seems to be panicking. Bobby pulls over.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Fuck this!...Just shut up, Grace. We done
dialog: nothing! Be cool. Let me do the talking. He
dialog: doesn't know anything.
text: His vehicle pulled up on the shoulder in front of them, the
text: Sheriff gets out, shining his power flashlight into their faces.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (starts)
dialog: 'Evening Sheriff, sorry bout that but this
dialog: jackrabbit...
text: Bobby has no time to react as the Sheriff is suddenly there at
text: his window, jerking his door open, angry. A GUN in his hand,
text: pointed at them, his eyes on Grace.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: You had to fuck him, didn't you!
speaker_heading: GRACE (nervous cool)
dialog: I would never do that to you, baby... He
dialog: killed Jake -- said he'd kill me if I
dialog: didn't come with him. All he wants is the
dialog: money.
text: Bobby looks at her. He cannot believe what he just heard.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: What!
text: SHERIFF (flipping, yelling)
dialog: Don't lie to me!
text: Grace knows the jam is up.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: OK...but he never made me cum! Really
dialog: Virgil, I was only doing what I had to do
dialog: so we could be free. Just like we talked
dialog: about. It meant nothing.
text: A pause. Virgil wants to kill her, but he also wants her back
dialog: badly.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You fucking him too Grace? Is everybody
dialog: fucking everybody in this town?
text: She ignores him. Her attention on the backpack with the money
text: between her legs -- the gun is there, inside an outer flap of
text: the bag.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: You fuck this guy -- get him to do your
dialog: dirty work and you think you can take the
dialog: money and dump me?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No baby, you got it wrong.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where
dialog: were you going to meet me?
text: His flashlight on the four suitcases in the backseat. She
dialog: doesn't have an answer to that one.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's not like that it... Look, Virgil, I
dialog: got the money here.
text: She gets out of the car on her side, comes around to him, the
text: pack of money slung on her shoulder, hard to see in the dark.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF (hurt)
dialog: Oh Grace, you can say what you want...but,
dialog: I watched you fuck that pervert for years
dialog: while you're telling me you loved me? What
dialog: happened to going to Milwaukee together?
dialog: You and me -- gonna open up the finest
dialog: sporting goods store that city ever did
dialog: see? Get us a place on the north shore, by
dialog: the lake? Season Brewer tickets! Just you
dialog: and me, Grace. What happened?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: All talk, that's all you did was talk, and
dialog: all I did was sit around getting older
dialog: waiting for you to free me! You never did
dialog: nothin' Virgil, you're weak! (pointing to
dialog: Bobby) He did!
text: The Sheriff, deeply wounded, casts a hot vicious gaze on Bobby.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: This is some girl you and me got here
dialog: Bobby, yessir, an excellent cocksuck too,
dialog: wouldn't you say? (back at Grace)... Course
dialog: you had a lotta practice haven't you
dialog: darling, going way back to your crazy mama!
speaker_heading: GRACE (deadly)
dialog: Shut up, Virgil! Take your share of the
dialog: money. It's not so bad.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not
dialog: gonna give up everything I got for a lousy
dialog: 50,000 dollars. It's you. You Grace or
dialog: nothing. The whole thing... I want you to
dialog: be my wife...(hopeful). What do you way
dialog: Grace?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You sound just like Jake... I did see into
dialog: the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it.
dialog: Go back to your family. They love you.
text: Bobby gets out of the car, misunderstanding the situation.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (misunderstanding)
dialog: Look, we got more. We got $200,000 at
dialog: least. Split it three ways, we all walk
dialog: away...
text: The Sheriff snaps and smashes Bobby with his flashlight,
text: knocking him to the ground, kicking him again and again,
text: gathering the psychic force to murder him. Grace tries to
dialog: approach.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Shut up, boy! You don't know shit round
dialog: here! (to Grace) Get back. Did she tell you
dialog: that story about the bird flying away?
text: BOBBY (rolling on the ground)
dialog: Ow! Look, I ... ow!
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Stop! Stop it!
text: SHERIFF (kicking again and again)
dialog: Were you going to help her fly away,
dialog: asshole? What'd you think, you were the
dialog: first boy to drift through this town she
dialog: came on to? She tell you the story about
dialog: old Jake forcing her to marry him? That's a
dialog: good story... How he killed her crazy Mama?
text: Bobby in bloody agony. Grace stunned that Virgil would reveal
dialog: this now publicly.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Goddamnit Virgil, stop! Don't!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: ...But I bet the story she didn't tell you
dialog: was the best story of all. How old crazy
dialog: Jake was really her Papa. And she liked
dialog: fucking Papa! And now she's killed the
dialog: sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill
dialog: you!
text: Grace plunges into the pack, pulls the gun and shoots Virgil
text: across the car in the gut.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No...you! You!
text: The Sheriff flies back onto the road, stunned, not realizing
dialog: what's happened.
text: Bobby watches unbelieving as Grace quietly steps up over the
dialog: Sheriff.
text: She puts the next round in his nuts, a modern fury enacting
dialog: ancient wrath.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Grace. No!
text: The Sheriff is wide-eyed, dying in shock. Grace then fires right
text: at his head in a coup de grace that blows his brains out the
text: back of his head.
text: Grace and Bobby both stare, then Grace jumps into action,
text: dragging the body. She snaps to Bobby.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Help me get him off the road. Into the car!
dialog: We'll ditch his car... Get the fuck up!
text: Bobby stares at her.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT
text: They're driving. GRACE and BOBBY, wordless, each thinking in
text: separate worlds. Grace wipes her hands. The bag with the money
text: between her legs. The Baretta is back in the bag.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (finally)
dialog: Jesus, did you have to kill him?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: He was in love with you Grace. He would've
dialog: done what you wanted, you could've made a
dialog: deal and ...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: The only deal he had in mind was killing
dialog: you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me
dialog: into sucking his dick for the rest of my
dialog: life... no thanks.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: He was a cop, Grace, they never stop
dialog: looking for you when you kill a cop...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: He was a scumbag!... He wanted me, Bobby.
dialog: These guys don't let go! Even when they're
dialog: dead... (softer) You don't know what it was
dialog: like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
text: A silence. The oncoming road.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: So, aren't you going to ask me?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Ask you what? You mean what kind of
dialog: horrifying sick shit is coming next?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Don't you want to know...? I bet it's
dialog: burning a hole in your brain just now?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a
dialog: past...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my
dialog: Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't
dialog: you want to know that?
speaker_heading: BOBBY (shouting)
dialog: What do you want me to say!
text: She's yelling, emotionally out of control.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yes! I was! I was fucking Daddy! And I
dialog: married him!... I married him...okay?
text: She looks at Bobby, forces him to look at her. Finally:
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I don't know why!
text: She drops back in her seat. Tears come.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: All I wanted was to be a kid... He took
dialog: that from me... They all did... (very
dialog: quietly, dangerously) They treated me like
dialog: meat. A piece of meat. Fuck me. Blow me.
dialog: Bend over. Stick their fingers up my ass...
dialog: Fuck them! Fuck the whole town! They
dialog: deserved to die!
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: And us Grace? What do we deserve?
text: GRACE (crying quietly to herself)
dialog: "Nin chonk, nin chonk," my Mama used to say
dialog: in Apache. "Your worst is doing this to
dialog: you," she said, "your worst has killed
dialog: you." And "Be go tsee" -- "you will find
dialog: out the result of what you have done..."
dialog: Just when you think it's over, when you've
dialog: gotten away, it begins. Cause you never get
dialog: away.
text: Bobby stares straight ahead at the oncoming road. Can he still
text: love her? She seems to be reading his thoughts, like she said
dialog: she could.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's easy to judge someone else when you
dialog: don't know nothing about it... I'm Apache,
dialog: Bobby. You don't eat what I eat. You don't
dialog: see what I see. Don't judge me.
text: A silence. Two former lovers in the dark of a car moving through
text: the strangeness of an Arizona desert at night.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't want to think anymore.
speaker_heading: GRACE (quietly)
dialog: Then drive...
text: The lights of the car fade until there is nothing but darkness.
text: THE SUN COMES UP:
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON - END SPOT - DAWN
text: In the vast reaches of a deserted canyon, where VULTURES circle
text: in a hot white sky, we find the MUSTANG parked at the edge of a
text: drop. We hear the SOUND of a body being dragged.
speaker_heading: D.J. (V.O.)
dialog: ...Nobody's sure where it was heading so
dialog: fast but the way it hit the semi, it won't
dialog: be getting home now! Hey area weather is
dialog: gonna be hot! Hot! Hot! Then cold! Cold!
dialog: Cold! Just like yesterday. Just like every
dialog: day. Some surprise, huh? So if you're
dialog: planning on anything, don't. You don't like
dialog: the weather, just wait one minute. Got any
dialog: brains, get up to Alaska and get yourself
dialog: some trailer park where you don't see no
text: desert for miles and miles...
speaker_heading: BOBBY (over)
dialog: Right there... Drop it there. I got it.
text: BOBBY is giving GRACE instructions as they drop SHERIFF VIRGIL
text: POTTER'S corpse over a drop onto some rocks 30 yards below.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: See ya, Virgil. God bless.
text: Bobby pushes him over, his hand hurting. The body crashes below.
text: It's hard work. They head back for the Mustang, to retrieve
text: JAKE'S body in the popped trunk. But Grace notices Bobby
text: glancing at the Baretta now tucked in her waist.
text: The silence is tense between them, the rocks and gravel
text: crunching under their shoes as they walk.
speaker_heading: GRACE (indicates the gun)
dialog: Is this what's bothering you Bobby?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You think now that Jake's dead, there's all
dialog: that money there and I don't need you
dialog: anymore, and I might just sneak up behind
dialog: you sometime and...pop!
text: She pulls an imaginary trigger on Bobby, mimicking the recoil of
text: a gun. Bobby is nervous.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted
dialog: to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You could give me my gun back.
text: Grace smiles.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Why don't we just finish what we started.
text: She stares down at Jake. She can't help feeling some old
text: feelings. As Bobby walks back to the front of the car, turns off
text: the annoying radio. He watches as she softly prays over Jake,
text: whose face is concealed by the blanket in which he is rolled.
dialog: GRACE (after a moment with Jake)
dialog: What do you think happens to someone's
dialog: spirit when they die?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I think nothing happens. You're dead meat.
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You don't believe in anything do you,
dialog: Bobby?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I believe in this moment, that's all. There
dialog: is nothing else.
dialog: (lifting Jake by the shoulder)
dialog: Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
text: Grace leans into the trunk to take his boots when he makes his
text: move, quickly, closing on her when she's off guard. He slams her
text: hard in the face, coldly sending her sprawling to the ground,
text: dazed.
text: He steps over her and grabs the gun in her waist, checks it.
text: She puts her hand to her mouth, feels the blood on her finger
text: tips. She looks at him and laughs a wild crazed laugh that cuts
text: into Bobby like a knife.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You hit me, Bobby? You hit a woman, you
dialog: motherfucker! Didn't your Momma ever teach
dialog: you anything...?
text: Her eyes go to the gun in his hand and she stops laughing. Her
text: calm is extraordinary, as if expecting to die.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Well?
text: For a moment, Bobby does nothing, then he slips the gun through
text: his belt.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the
dialog: money, then you're on your own.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Don't leave me. I want to say with you,
dialog: Bobby.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Why? So when the cops catch up with us you
dialog: can sell me out again?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to
dialog: tell him that to get his guard down. Just
dialog: like you told Jake you was going to kill
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies.
dialog: Your mother, your father, what story are
dialog: you on now? How come the town didn't know
dialog: you was his daughter?
speaker_heading: GRACE (in pain)
dialog: Cause my Mom slept around. A lotta men!
dialog: Anybody could've been my father. But we
dialog: knew.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (not listening)
dialog: Well you got what you wanted all along by
dialog: fucking me. I wish you had told me the
dialog: goddamn truth in the first place!
speaker_heading: GRACE (screws out)
dialog: I didn't want you to know! Don't you...
dialog: unnerstand?
dialog: Bobby's got a headache now. It's too much to understand, too
dialog: much talk. Too much history has taught him to doubt.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: When you're finished with me, I'm next! I
dialog: been there, baby. I been there with other
dialog: cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you
dialog: as far as California. If we can make that.
dialog: After that you're on your own. Try Mexico.
dialog: With all this bread, you can live like a
dialog: queen.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby!
dialog: Please, I really want to be with you. Don't
dialog: blow this. Don't you think I care about
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I think you're a lying, back-stabbing
dialog: psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me.
dialog: But it's nice to know you cared...
text: The expression on Grace's face changes as rapidly as the desert
text: weather, a coldness passing over and through her.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You don't know your own mind. It blocks
dialog: your heart.
text: Keeping a wary eye on Grace, Bobby starts hauling Jake out of
text: the trunk.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Give me a hand.
text: He wrestles Jake up to a sitting position. He grabs a can of
text: beer from a warm six-pack in the trunk and shoves it into a
text: pocket of Jake's coat.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: Poor old Jake, a few drinks, a fight with
dialog: the sheriff over his wife. And both of 'em
dialog: ended up dead.
text: Grace takes his boots.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Time to go for a walk, Jake.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: My mother died in this canyon.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It
dialog: doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
text: They lift the corpse, and with great effort, haul it towards the
text: edge of the drop. As they pause on the way, Bobby, wary of
text: Grace's strange coldness, tries to soften the blow of
dialog: separation.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Look, it's not so bad we split up. It might
dialog: be months before they find these guys. If
dialog: at all. I mean with the mountain lions
dialog: around here. Remember, if they can't find
dialog: no bodies, there's no crime... (She doesn't
dialog: respond.) We'll be in Phoenix by noon. Lose
dialog: this car, get another one. Texas, Mexico
dialog: are big countries, all that money Grace,
dialog: you'll meet someone else, you know, there's
dialog: a lot of hope with a $100,000...
text: They lift Jake again, and move to the edge.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Hope is a four-letter word.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: But we all need that too. Hold him.
text: He props Jake at the edge, standing, and transfers the weight
text: onto Grace. Jake's head is on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You make a pretty couple.
text: It seems he might push them both over but instead takes the gun,
text: wipes it of his prints, and slips it through Jake's belt.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Won this in a poker game in Reno. God knows
dialog: who it's registered to. You shoulda been
dialog: more careful, Jake. See you later.
text: As he takes Jake's weight off Grace and pushes it over the drop.
text: Grace watches him go, her eyes shifting to Bobby, his back
text: momentarily to her, also watching. She moves towards him.
text: Bobby turns, slips on the edge.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Now all we got to do is try and--
text: He feels a blur of motion, almost like a bird, and he is
text: falling...falling, his life coming to an end.
text: Grace is standing somewhere up above, briefly seen. Did she push
dialog: him? He doesn't know.
text: He's stunned as he falls on the rocks next to the bodies of Jake
text: and Virgil. He screams out in sharp pain. His leg feels broken.
text: But he is alive.
text: Grace walks away, cutting it all off, deeply shaken. She must
dialog: get away from the past and all these hollow men. She closes the
text: trunk of the Mustang, gets in the driver's seat, reaches for the
text: ignition key. Her hand fumbles for it a moment. It isn't there.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Shit!
text: She sits there. Bobby is calling from below.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Grace! Help me, Grace...! We been through
dialog: too much together. We've only had one day,
dialog: but you and me have been through more than
dialog: most people ever will. I know you were
dialog: angry at me, and, you know, you were right!
dialog: I'm sorry I hit you. I was wrong about
dialog: leaving you. You don't belong in Mexico.
text: She finally gets out and walks back to the edge of the cliff,
text: looks down.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you
dialog: wouldn't leave me, Grace.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Bobby? Are you all right?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I busted my leg!
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Can you make it back up?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow
dialog: rope. It should reach down here. Go get it,
dialog: throw it down.
text: She looks. Of course the trunk is closed. She closed it.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Bobby, the trunk...it's locked. Throw the
dialog: keys up to me. I'll get the rope.
text: Bobby's eyes pass over Jake a few feet away, his eyes staring
text: upwards in death. They take in the gun still attached to his
text: waist. He knows the trunk wasn't locked when they took Jake out.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I can't throw that far. You got to climb
dialog: down here and get the keys. You can make
dialog: it. It's the only way Grace.
text: Grace looks down at the drop. It's a tough descent but she
dialog: knows she could make it and get back up as well.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Grace!...Please, Grace! You have to help
dialog: me.
text: Grace takes a look around.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Okay. I'm coming. Calm down!
text: She starts down the cliff face. As she descends, he talks
text: deliriously.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (off)
dialog: I knew you'd help me. I knew you wouldn't
dialog: leave me baby, cause we're tied together
dialog: too close. We belong together always.
text: Grace makes it to the bottom of the drop, and walks cautiously
text: towards Bobby.
text: GRACE (yelling back, echoing)
dialog: Bobby! Don't flip out on me. I can't do
dialog: this alone. I know you don't trust me, but
dialog: you gotta pull yourself together, I'm not
dialog: gonna leave you...I never wanted it to go
dialog: down like this. It was different with you
dialog: Bobby. You had dreams like me. You
dialog: listened... I would've gone anywhere with
dialog: you, Bobby. We can make this work. I'm
dialog: sorry...I really am. I didn't wanna hurt
dialog: you.
text: Can he believe her? She sounds so sincere this time.
text: She's heading for the body of Jake. And the gun. Bobby knows
text: that and is already crawling there.
text: BOBBY (as he crawls)
dialog: They're right here, Grace. The keys. Come
dialog: get me out of here... Know why else I could
dialog: never leave you?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: 'Cause I love you.
text: Inching closer.
text: Closer. They meet at the apex of Jake's corpse.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: And I love you too.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: And love's a funny thing. Sometimes I
dialog: don't know if I want to love you...
text: Grace leans close to Bobby. He dangles the keys out in front of
text: her, but she doesn't reach for them. Her eyes go to Bobby. She
text: reaches for him. At that instant Bobby's hands shoot out and
text: clamp hard around her. A sharp gurgle is all that escapes Grace
text: as Bobby twists the life from her, as Jake leers up at them.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: ...or kill you.
text: Grace twists and flails in Bobby's hands, but in spite of his
text: bleeding stump, he holds her like a bear trap holds a grizzly.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I love you Grace, but I just can't trust
dialog: you!
text: She looks at him, trying to protest, shaking her head. Grace's
text: flailing goes into overdrive. Somewhere in his semi-delirious
text: state, Bobby's eyes might notice the gun at Jake's waist is no
dialog: longer there.
dialog: Grace manages one word:
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Jake...
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: He can't help you now, honey!
text: Bobby is in agony as he kills her, part beast, part lover, he
dialog: kills that which he loves.
text: Suddenly, a SHOT is heard. Bobby buckles with the blast, hit in
text: the side. He kills her with one last wrenching thrust of his
text: hands, breaking her neck.
text: Bobby looks down at Jake's gun, which she clutches in her hand,
text: and sees the hole in his side and the river of blood that flows
text: from it. He manages to stand, looks at Jake; their bodies lying
text: side by side.
text: Bobby, with great difficulty, claws his way back up the rocks to
text: the car, his fast-flowing wound staining the white rocks with
dialog: blood.
text: He makes it to the top and, losing more blood, climbs into the
text: driver's seat. He checks the money in the bag. All there. All
dialog: his.
text: As he pulls a huge clot of blood from his side, the vultures
text: circle. Perhaps one, smarter than the others, lands close by. It
text: spooks Bobby but he's okay. He looks in the mirror.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You're still lucky.
text: He puts the key in the ignition, the engine comes to life.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (waves back)
dialog: Adios --
text: Suddenly, the RADIATOR HOSE Darrell installed blows apart
text: loudly. Bobby knows exactly and immediately what it is as a
text: cloud of steam now rolls from under his hood. He shakes his
text: head, frustrated.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (sighs)
dialog: Oh shit!...(then) Arizona.
text: He can't help but laugh at his bad luck. As we rise off the
text: desert floor and take flight with the vultures, eventually
text: leaving them all as specks of earth in the vast empty canyons of
dialog: Arizona.
speaker_heading: THE END
