dialog: “LET ME IN”
speaker_heading: BLACK SCREEN
text: We HEAR the DREADFUL MOANING and HOWLING of ARCTIC WIND.
text: FADE IN very slowly, TO DISCOVER we are HIGH ABOVE:
scene_heading: A SNOWY, RURAL LANDSCAPE - NIGHT
text: An empty TWO-LANE HIGHWAY snakes through massive pines;
text: MOUNTAINS loom in the distance. A BLIZZARD rages all around.
speaker_heading: HOLD.
text: HAZY GLOWS of FLASHING RED and BLUE LIGHT suddenly appear,
text: way down the highway. It’s a SMALL MOTORCADE. We make out
text: two POLICE CRUISERS, an AMBULANCE. The wind is so fierce, we
text: can’t even hear the sirens yet.
text: Through the swirling VEIL OF SNOW, the image looks surreal;
dialog: it could almost be a painting... or a dream...
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE MOTORCADE
text: SIRENS BLARING as they race through the blizzard.
scene_heading: THROUGH THE AMBULANCE WINDSHIELD
text: We SEE the HEAVY SNOW HURTLING toward us, obscuring the road
text: ahead. The STROBES from the roof periodically FLASH, and the
text: SNOWFLAKES suddenly appear to FREEZE in mid-air for a
text: blinding instant. It is completely disorienting. We HOLD on
text: this, as we HEAR TWO PARAMEDICS in the front seats (0.S.):
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC ONE (0.S.)
dialog: Jesus, I can’t see -- I can’t see a
dialog: fucking thing --
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC TWO (0.S.)
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: One three one to dispatch, come in!
scene_heading: IN THE BACK - QUICK, TIGHT SHOTS:
text: THREE MORE PARAMEDICS, wearing long RUBBER GLOVES work
text: feverishly on a completely naked PATIENT, whose face is
text: obscured from our view. The Unseen Patient THRASHES
text: VIOLENTLY as they work, in complete agony --
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
scene_heading: UNSEEN PATIENT’S POV - HANDHELD:
text: Twisting and turning, looking straight up at the Paramedics
text: as they struggle fiercely to hold him down --
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC THREE
dialog: Hold him down! Get his arms! Get
dialog: his arms!
dialog: The Unseen Patient GASPS and GAGS --
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC THREE
dialog: I need an irrigation lens and a
dialog: 1000cc’s of saline -- !
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC FOUR
dialog: Got it!
text: As he reaches for the Patient’s eyes -- right at CAMERA --
scene_heading: the GASPING ACCELERATES -- AND --
scene_heading: THE PATIENT’S WRIST
text: swings up into FRAME, in panic -- it snaps short suddenly
text: with a CLANG! It is HANDCUFFED TO THE GURNEY.
speaker_heading: UP FRONT
text: The RADIO CRACKLES to life as we watch the strobing blizzard:
speaker_heading: RADIO (V.O.)
dialog: Go ahead one three one!
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC TWO (0.S.)
dialog: This is one three one! We have a
text: male, mid-fifties with burns over
dialog: nine to nine and a half percent of
dialog: his body! Prior to our arrival on
dialog: scene, patient apparently doused
text: his head, neck and face with some
dialog: sort of highly concentrated acid!
dialog: Patient’s airway is severely
dialog: compromised due to fume inhalation!
dialog: Vital signs unstable! Please
dialog: advise! Patient is a criminal
dialog: suspect! We’re coming in with a
dialog: police escort right now!
speaker_heading: IN BACK
text: The Paramedics wrestle with the Unseen Patient --
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC FOUR
dialog: OK -- it’s in! The lens is in!
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC THREE
dialog: Irrigate!
scene_heading: UNSEEN PATIENT’S POV -- HANDHELD:
text: MORE EXCRUCIATING GASPING and CHOKING sounds as our view
text: FLOODS with SALINE -- the IMAGE LITERALLY RIPPLES -- and WE --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A MOVING SHOT, DOWN A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: We're FOLLOWING ON THE BACK of a PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN as he
text: makes his way towards a HOSPITAL ROOM DOORWAY. As he
text: arrives, a PRIEST is on his way out. The Policeman stops,
text: allowing the Priest to pass. The Priest nods to him gravely.
text: We FOLLOW the PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN INTO:
scene_heading: THE DARK HOSPITAL ROOM
text: where a HEAVYSET NURSE attends to a bed on the other side of
text: the room, her body blocking our view of the Patient’s face.
text: She turns, hearing the Policeman; approaches. HUSHED TONES:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Can I talk to him?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: He can’t actually talk...
text: The Policeman LOOKS OFF SCREEN, past her, sees the Unseen
text: Patient for the first time; whatever he sees, it knocks the
text: wind out of him. He nods, utters under his breath, shaken:
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: I see. Jesus...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Alright, well... can I... just
dialog: have a few minutes?
text: The Nurse nods and leaves the room. The Policeman moves
text: toward the UNSEEN PATIENT’S BED slowly, apprehensive --
scene_heading: FROM THE UNSEEN PATIENT’S POV:
text: We finally get a CLOSE LOOK at the Policeman’s face as he
text: steps up. He’s mid-40s, with soulful but determined eyes. A
dialog: small town sense about him. From his haunted expression, you
dialog: get the feeling he’s never seen anything quite like this.
text: MACHINE NOISE surrounds us: A RESPIRATOR HISSES ominously...
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: The Policeman unzips his jacket, takes a POLICE NOTEBOOK out,
text: opens it, places it in front of the Unseen Patient; he takes
text: out a PEN, carefully places the Patient’s FINGERS around it.
text: Then he looks up, RIGHT INTO CAMERA, struggling a bit:
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: We, uh... We wanna know who you are.
text: Beat. His eyes drift down to THE PATIENT’S HAND, gripping
text: the pen. There is a fresh ACID SCAR across the top of it.
text: The hand remains perfectly still, no intention of writing...
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN (CONT ’D)
dialog: We'll find out, you know. Sooner or
dialog: later. You could save us some
dialog: legwork by communicating with us now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I just got off the phone with the
dialog: Federal Bureau of Investigation.
dialog: Guess there’s an idea you been
dialog: involved in a whole lot more than
dialog: just what’s been going on around
dialog: here. Like maybe this all goes way
text: back. Other states. Other cities.
dialog: (stares at him)
dialog: Is that true?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Are you a Satanist? You in some
dialog: kind of cult? Coz if there are
dialog: others involved, we'll find them
dialog: too, believe me.
text: The PACE of the HEART MONITOR speeds up a bit. The Policeman
text: turns, noticing; he turns back, trying to gauge the reaction:
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN (CONT ’D)
dialog: What’s the matter? Is that it? Is
dialog: there someone you wanna tell me
dialog: about? People you’re involved with?
dialog: (beat; then)
dialog: Look, I’m gonna be honest with you.
dialog: Your prognosis here... it’s not too
dialog: good. What you did, it’s a real...
dialog: shock to your system. There may not
dialog: be a lotta time left. So maybe...
dialog: Maybe you got some things here you
dialog: wanna tell me. Things that are
dialog: weighing heavy. On your heart.
dialog: Maybe you could write ‘em down for
dialog: me. Clear your conscience.
dialog: 
text: The Nurse appears again in the doorway:
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I’m sorry. The Nurse at reception
text: downstairs is on the phone. She wants
dialog: to talk to you. Says it’s urgent.
text: The Policeman turns to her, nods; then turns back, stares
text: INTO CAMERA, cautious, searching, wondering if maybe he is on
dialog: the verge of something here...
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: I’ll be right back... Okay?
text: He turns to go; and we CUT FOR THE FIRST TIME TO REVEAL:
speaker_heading: THE PATIENT
text: Under bandages is a viciously acid-ravaged face -- almost
text: unrecognizable as human anymore. Haunted eyes stare out from
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: mangled flesh, gazing after the Policeman with a sense of
text: fear. After a beat, he looks down in front of him at:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE POLICE NOTEBOOK
text: where his hand rests, holding the pen, motionless. We HOLD
text: FOR A VERY LONG BEAT. Finally, fingers trembling, he lifts
text: the pen, begins to WRITE...
dialog: 
scene_heading: NURSES STATION - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Policeman is on the phone. BEHIND HIM, RONALD REAGAN
text: silently gives a speech on TV -- the sound is off.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: His daughter? When was this -- is
dialog: she still here...?
text: Suddenly, a BEEPING ALARM sounds from behind the station --
text: the heavyset Nurse checks the bank of patient monitors -- she
text: quickly starts for the suspect’s hospital room -- the
text: Policeman notices, growing concerned; we SLOWLY PUSH IN:
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: (into phone; distracted,
dialog: eyes following Nurse)
dialog: Well did she leave any information,
dialog: a phone number...?
text: The response on the phone suddenly focuses him again --
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN (CONT ’D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What do you mean a little girl?
dialog: How little...?
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: JUST THEN, a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM erupts (0.S.) from the
text: hospital room! The Policeman drops the phone and rushes --
text: BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ROOM
text: WIND SWIRLS. The Nurse is standing next to the OPEN WINDOW,
text: horrified, her head in her hands. THE HOSPITAL BED IS EMPTY.
text: The Policeman moves over to LOOK --
scene_heading: OUT THE WINDOW:
text: THE PATIENT'S DEAD BODY LIES TWISTED SICKLY ON THE SNOW-
text: COVERED GROUND, TEN FLOORS BELOW!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: (utters, breathless)
dialog: Jesus, Mary, and Joseph...
text: IN THE EMPTY BED
text: The POLICE NOTEBOOK lies open, it’s pages fluttering gently
text: in the wind. On top, written in the dead Patient’s TORTURED
text: SCRAWL are the words: “Abby... I’m sorry...” HOLD; then --
speaker_heading: TIMECUT TO:
text: A WIDE TABLEAU SHOT OF THE FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: We are INSIDE THE LOBBY, LOOKING OUT through massive GLASS
text: WINDOWS. POLICE CARS and FORENSIC TEAMS have gathered.
text: CRIMSON SNOW drifts serenely over everything, ILLUMINATED by
text: the SPINNING RED EMERGENCY LIGHTS on the vehicles.
text: A SMALL CROWD -- the Policeman included -- watches as the
text: Patient’s body is zipped into a body bag...
text: In the FOREGROUND, over this, we see AN OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE OF
text: RONALD REAGAN continuing his speech -- it’s a REFLECTION from
text: the LOBBY TV, on the window in front of the body. Down here
text: the sound is on -- it’s the “Evil Empire” speech:
scene_heading: RONALD REAGAN ON TV
dialog: There is sin and evil in the world,
dialog: and we’re enjoined by scripture and
dialog: the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all
dialog: our might. Our nation, too, has a
dialog: legacy of evil with which it must
dialog: deal. The glory of this land has
dialog: been its capacity for transcending
dialog: the moral evils of our past...
text: The Policeman lifts his hand -- there’s something in it: it’s
text: the POLICE NOTEBOOK; he stares at it... haunted...
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
scene_heading: SUPER the TITLE CARD: “LITTLETON, COLORADO. MARCH, 1983.”
text: A NURSE steps up behind the Policeman, starts to say
text: something, and just as he turns we:
text: CUT TO BLACK. THE SOUND WASHES AWAY INTO SILENCE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLD.
text: After a long beat, we start to HEAR a CHILD’S VOICE, QUIETLY
text: SINGING; there’s something mournful about it... EERIE...
speaker_heading: CHILD'S SINGING
dialog: Eat some now, save some for later...
dialog: Eat some now, save some for later...
text: ANOTHER SUPER TITLE FADES UP: “TWO MONTHS EARLIER...”
text: A DISTANT TRAIN HORN CRIES as we SLOWLY FADE IN TO REVEAL:
text: A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY, HIS BACK TO US, SEATED ON A JUNGLE GYM
text: We're PUSHING IN ON HIM as he sings to himself, completely
text: hidden in a HOODED, METALLIC SILVER WINTER JACKET; BREATH
text: STEAMS around his head in the dim, blue TWILIGHT. SNOW
text: BLANKETS the ground underfoot. No one else is around.
text: As we CREEP CLOSER, the Boy reaches into his pocket, pulling
text: out candies, unwrapping them, and popping them into his
text: mouth, one by one, in a constant stream. The rhythm of his
text: song is periodically interrupted by the need to chew.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (singing absently, hushed)
dialog: Now and Later... the really tasty
dialog: treat... Now and Later... the
dialog: flavor can’t be beat...
text: Suddenly, a WOMAN’S VOICE ECHOES distantly:
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE
dialog: Owwwwen...?
dialog: The Boy keeps on singing:
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Look at all those...
dialog: (chews; then: )
dialog: ..-pieces... Flavors that are wow...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE
dialog: Owwwwen...?
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: We STOP in CLOSE UP on the BACK of the BOY’S HEAD -- and he
text: finally TURNS TO US, in the direction of the Woman’s Voice:
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (annoyed, mouth full)
dialog: This is OWEN.
text: On the verge of thirteen, his face still has a delicate, pre-
text: adolescent androgyny. He looks innocent, almost fragile.
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE
dialog: Dinner time, honey...!
text: As Owen gets up to go, he pulls a fistful of candy wrappers
text: from his pocket, dumps them on the ground, buries them in the
text: snow with his foot. CUT WIDE to SEE we are in:
scene_heading: A MASSIVE 1960'S ERA APARTMENT COMPLEX - COURTYARD - TWILIGHT
text: The jungle gym sits in a meager playground at the center of
text: the deserted courtyard. Tall buildings surround us. As Owen
text: trudges away through the snow toward his building we CUT TO:
scene_heading: LONG LENS CLOSE ON OWEN - AT THE DINNER TABLE - NIGHT
text: Owen sits, head bowed, holding his MOTHER’s hand as she says
text: grace in the F.G., SOFT FOCUS. HOLD on OWEN throughout:
speaker_heading: OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
dialog: Bless us O Lord, and these Thy gifts,
dialog: for which we are about to receive,
dialog: from Thy bounty, in the name of Jesus
dialog: Christ, our Lord, Amen.
text: As they release hands, Owen’s mother’s ARM reaches over,
text: pours Chablis into a WINE GLASS in the F.G. -- OWEN’S EYES
text: flit a bit anxiously to the glass as it FILLS...
speaker_heading: OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
dialog: How was school today?
text: Owen scrunches his face, shrugs a shoulder. She laughs:
speaker_heading: OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
dialog: That good, huh?
dialog: (notices he’s not eating)
dialog: Hey, what’s this -- you didn’t go
dialog: and spoil your dinner on me now,
dialog: did you? Owen? Sweetie, you
dialog: promised me...
text: He guiltily stabs a forkful of his Kraft mac and cheese:
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: ..-MNo... What? I didn’t...
text: The PHONE RINGS. She stands, and we FLEETINGLY GLIMPSE for
text: the first time she wears a POWDER BLUE NIGHTGOWN and ROBE --
speaker_heading: OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
dialog: Eat. Please, honey.
text: She musses his hair affectionately, EXITS FRAME, ANSWERS PHONE:
speaker_heading: OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (she quiets, darkens)
dialog: What. No, what?
text: Owen turns, watching her OFF-SCREEN with growing anxiety...
speaker_heading: OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
dialog: Look... Look, I’m not -- I’m not
dialog: gonna discuss this now, okay?
dialog: We're eating dinner.
text: Owen’s EYES discreetly FOLLOW as she reaches into FRAME, grabs
text: her WINE, then paces 0.S. -- the PHONE CORD stretches TAUT...
speaker_heading: OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
dialog: Well, we had an agreement, George.
dialog: Okay? We agreed...
dialog: (then)
dialog: You know what? I think maybe you
dialog: better call my lawyer, okay...? Yes.
dialog: Right. Because you know he’d never
dialog: let you get away with this shit.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Don’t talk to me like that -- I will
dialog: not. Be spoken to. In that way!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay, I’m going now, George, okay?
dialog: «What? He’1ll call you back.
dialog: We're eating, George.
text: She SIGHS, re-enters FRAME, holds out the phone:
speaker_heading: OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
dialog: Your father wants to talk to you...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (into phone, uncomfortable)
dialog: Hello? ...Hi... I’m okay...
text: Owen steals a final look at the WINE GLASS as his mother sets
text: it down again in the F.G., RE-FILLS it...
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. OWEN’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Owen gingerly sets his plate in the sink, which is piled with
text: dirty dishes. He peeks THROUGH THE DOORWAY INTO:
scene_heading: THE DARKENED LIVING ROOM
text: Where his mother, partially obscured by the door jam, sits
text: with her wine glass, watching ranting televangelist, Dr. Gene
text: Scott on TV. We HEAR the sound of her CRYING.
text: Owen turns away, hopeless. He is about to go when he SEES:
scene_heading: A LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE
text: Lying on the counter. His eyes linger on it...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: A model of the SPACE SHUTTLE hangs from the ceiling. There’s
text: a TELESCOPE by the window. Posters of the planets. STAR
text: WARS toys. “Beth” by KISS plays softly from a cheap RADIO.
text: OWEN’S BARE FEET stalk slowly though the chaotic, clothes-
text: strewn mess on the floor... We HEAR his BREATHING...
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE
text: As it pierces the air, creeping forward threateningly...
speaker_heading: OWEN (0.S.)
dialog: (very quiet, menacing)
dialog: Hey little girl...
text: REVEAL Owen as he steps up to his dresser MIRROR. He’s
text: stripped down to his underwear, holding the knife, and
text: wearing a PLASTIC, SEMI-TRANSPARENT HALLOWEEN MASK which
text: completely obscures his expression. It’s a disturbing image.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (staring down his “victim”)
dialog: Are you a little girl...?
text: Just then a WOMAN’S SHRIEK echoes distantly. Owen turns as
text: LIGHT SPILLS onto his ceiling from outside his window. There's
text: a MAN'S VOICE too. Owen sets down the knife, moves to:
speaker_heading: HIS WINDOW
text: Across the courtyard, framed in one of the other apartment
text: windows, a COUPLE, having just come home, are ARGUING
text: passionately. We can’t make out what they’re saying.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 11.
text: They are LARRY and VIRGINIA, early 30s.
text: Owen watches them, motionless. He turns his telescope
text: towards them, cautiously presses his eye to the eyepiece...
speaker_heading: THE TELESCOPE
text: FOCUSES on Virginia as she yells at Larry. She’s hot-tempered.
text: Has a somewhat trashy, small town sexiness. Larry tries to
text: calm her to no avail, reaches for her wrist; she pulls away.
text: At their feet, a tiny LAP DOG BARKS incessantly.
text: Owen just stares from behind the mask. Slowly BREATHING...
text: Finally, he turns the telescope... starts to peep into other
dialog: windows... He finds:
scene_heading: A FORTY-ISH, SHIRTLESS MAN (JACK)
text: lying on a BENCH in his cramped living room, lifting weights.
text: His CHEST is OVERLY DEVELOPED.
text: Owen pulls his eye from the telescope, pushes up his mask.
text: He looks down at his own scrawny chest, ashamed. Then he
text: notices something: the courtyard is QUIET again. He looks
text: up, swings the telescope back toward:
scene_heading: LARRY AND VIRGINIA’S APARTMENT
text: Virginia has calmed. Larry, contrite, rubs her arm
text: apologetically... He tries to kiss her, but she turns away.
text: He touches her face, tries again; grudgingly, she lets him...
text: Owen watches with morbid fascination as the KISS builds...
text: turns SEXUAL, as Virginia gives in... Larry starts to grope
text: her, reaches into her shirt, exposing her breast, WHEN --
scene_heading: VIRGINIA’S STARTLED EYES SUDDENLY MEET THE TELESCOPE --
dialog: 
text: OWEN backs away, terrified -- ducks behind his curtain. He
text: stands there frozen, heart racing. HOLD.
text: Finally, he PEEKS back: Virginia is closing the drapes.
text: Humiliated, Owen starts to turn away when he SEES --
scene_heading: A SILHOUETTED U-HAUL MOVING TRUCK
text: RUMBLE into the driveway between buildings. A FIGURE climbs
text: out, disappears behind the truck. After a moment, he re-
text: emerges, struggling with SEVERAL VERY LARGE SUITCASES along
text: the passenger side.
text: He stops, looks up into the cab, panting, his breath misting
text: up into the freezing air. He waits. Finally, ANOTHER MUCH
text: SMALLER FIGURE emerges, climbing down. Owen LOOKS:
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 12.
text: THROUGH THE TELESCOPE
text: It is A TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL. Wrapped in a dark poncho, she
text: has mysterious, somewhat coarse features, like a gypsy. She
text: doesn’t even acknowledge the Figure waiting beside her. She
text: just starts into the courtyard.
text: The Figure -- a BALDING, WEARY MAN IN HIS MID-FIFTIES --
text: finally follows with the heavy luggage, looking almost like
text: her servant. Or maybe her father.
text: Owen watches as they make their way toward his building. As
text: they get close, he notices something through the telescope --
text: despite the snowy ground, THE GIRL IS COMPLETELY BAREFOOT.
text: Owen cranes to look straight down out his window, as, right
text: below him, the pair disappear into the entrance to his building.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A NARROW VIEW THROUGH OWEN’S PARTIALLY OPENED FRONT DOOR
text: We look out at a STAIRWELL at the end of the EMPTY HALL.
text: Approaching FOOTSTEPS ECHO. Just as the TOP of the GIRL’S
text: HEAD starts to appear, climbing up the stairs --
text: OWEN quickly and quietly SHUTS his front door. He waits,
text: pressed against the front door as the MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS grow
text: LOUDER. Finally, he gets the courage to PEEK --
text: THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE
text: Just as the Girl and the Man pass, distorted and obscured by
text: the LENS’ FISHEYE EFFECT. We HEAR OWEN BREATHING RAPIDLY...
scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: The DOOR SLOWLY OPENS a crack, and OWEN peers cautiously out
text: to SEE the BALDING MAN, setting down the luggage, starting to
text: open the door to the apartment RIGHT NEXT DOOR.
text: Owen stares down again at the Girl’s bare feet as she waits,
text: her face turned away. Finally, she steps inside. The
text: Balding Man picks up the luggage, steps in after her.
scene_heading: INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Owen lies on his bed, eating Now and Laters, LISTENING to the
text: SOUNDS of his new neighbors coming through the wall. There’s
text: a STRANGE, EERIE GROANING... a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING...
text: We MOVE IN ON OWEN as he leans close to the wall, trying to
text: make out the INTENSE SOUNDS with a building sense of dread...
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 13.
text: We’re CLOSE on HIS WIDE OPEN EYES when we hear a SUDDEN LOUD
text: BANG FROM THE WALL -- and we FLASHCUT TO A HAUNTING VISION:
scene_heading: AN AQUA BLUE FIELD -- VERY SHALLOW FOCUS
text: CRIMSON-COLORED CLOUDS BILLOW and GROW disturbingly -- it
text: looks like BLOOD POURING into PURE, CLEAR BLUE WATER...
text: We HOLD -- THEN SEE THREE LIGHTENING FAST CUTS OF TIGHT SHOTS:
dialog: -- FLESH TEARS -- !
scene_heading: — VICIOUS DEMONIC EYES STARE -- !
scene_heading: -- BLOOD SPRAYS -- !
dialog: 
text: OWEN GASPS, sits up with a START! CUT WIDE to REVEAL we are:
scene_heading: INT. OWEN’S ROOM —- MORNING
text: Owen sits in bed, in exactly the spot we left him last night,
text: having just awakened from a nightmare. He starts to get his
text: bearings, looks around him at the room in the morning light.
text: Finally, he stares at the wall. Everything is quiet now.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - MORNING
text: Owen steps out of his building wearing his heavy jacket and a
text: BACKPACK. He starts across the courtyard when he SPOTS: A
text: BARE FOOTPRINT in the snow. He turns back, looks up... in_
text: the apartment next to his, the WINDOWS have been COMPLETELY
text: BOARDED UP from the inside with NEWSPAPER AND CARDBOARD.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As he stares, we start to hear:
speaker_heading: CHILDREN’S VOICES
dialog: I pledge allegiance... to the flag...
dialog: of the United States of America...
scene_heading: INT. OWEN’S MIDDLE SCHOOL HOMEROOM - MORNING
text: We’re MOVING PAST about 30 STUDENTS, giving the pledge:
speaker_heading: STUDENTS (CONT’D)
dialog: And to the Republic... for which it
dialog: stands...
text: FIND OWEN, hand over his heart, reciting with the others --
speaker_heading: STUDENTS (CONT’D)
dialog: One Nation... under God...
text: SPLAT! A huge SPITBALL slaps onto Owen’s jacket. He turns
text: to see one of the students smiling cruelly. This is KENNY.
text: Resigned, Owen starts to scrape the mess off, and we CUT TO:

dialog: 14.
scene_heading: INT. INDOOR MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL - MORNING
text: Pre-class chaos. KIDS IN BATHING SUITS scream, splash, push
text: each other into the pool. Still fully dressed, Owen walks up
text: behind his Serbian P.E. teacher, MR. ZORIC, says meekly:
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Mr. Zoric...?
text: Mr. Zoric turns, sees Owen is not in his bathing suit:
speaker_heading: MR. ZORIC
dialog: Owen -- c’mon, serious... again?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: I have a cold. My mom wrote me a note.
text: He holds out THE NOTE: clearly in Owen’s own handwriting,
text: misspellings and all, it reads: “PLEASE EXSCUSE OWEN FROM
dialog: SWIMING. HE HAS A COLD.”
text: Mr. Zoric stares at Owen for a long beat; takes pity on him:
speaker_heading: MR. ZORIC
dialog: Okay. Go sit in bleecher.
text: Owen sits, looks out at THE POOL, a bit miserably, SEEING:
speaker_heading: KENNY
text: who, along with TWO COHORTS, circles and accosts a GIRL WITH

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Hey little girl...

speaker_heading: KENNY

speaker_heading: KENNY
dialog: That’s why he won’t go swimming --
dialog: he doesn’t want everyone to see what
dialog: a little fucking girl he is --

scene_heading: OWEN’S POV - HANDHELD:

dialog: Hold him down! Get his arms! Get

text: Owen SQUIRMS FRANTICALLY for an excruciating moment, until

dialog: Jesus! Fucking freak!

text: OWEN’S HAND GRABBING FIVE PACKS OF NOW AND LATER CANDIES

scene_heading: INT. LITTLETON VIDEO ARCADE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Owen waits in line at the pay counter. The after school
text: crowd is here, and the DIN from the games is DEAFENING.
text: Owen looks over at a TENTH GRADE COUPLE making out by the MS.
text: PAC-MAN machine, their tongues deep in each other’s mouths.
text: Owen stares, when suddenly he BARELY HEARS the VOICE of the
text: SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD COUNTERMAN calling him over the cacophony.
text: Embarrassed, Owen places his candy and a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
text: on the glass counter. As the Counterman grabs the money,

text: an OPEN PEN KNIFE among some knickknacks; HIS EYES FIX ON IT.

text: The two STARE at each other for an eerie, suspended moment.
dialog: 
text: Owen attempts a smile; but the Balding Man just picks up the

scene_heading: EXT. WAL-MART PARKING LOT - LONG LENS SHOT - NIGHT

text: the F.G. -- we HEAR the familiar “FLIT-FLIT-FLIT” of the BIC
text: LIGHTER again; SMOKE rises INTO FRAME, and we realize we are
text: now WATCHING from the BALDING MAN’S POV, over his shoulder...
dialog: 
text: A BEATEN-UP DATSUN B-210 pulls into the lot, parks. A BARELY
text: SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KID gets out, heads toward the store...
text: HEAR a LONG EXHALE; a STREAM OF SMOKE blows into F.G. view...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE DATSUN’S DRIVER DOOR
text: Seen from the shoulders down, the Balding Man’s GLOVED HANDS
text: slide a tow truck driver’s “SLIM JIM” down the car’s window

text: The SIXTEEN YEAR OLD approaches. We HEAR the VERY FAINT

text: HOLD as the Kid gets in, starts the engine, drives out...
text: After a few moments, we NOTICE something BLURRY moving very
text: subtly in the F.G.; the Kid does not... CUT AROUND TO:
speaker_heading: THE REVERSE ANGLE
text: past the Kid as he drives. Right behind him, just visible in
text: shadow, is a FIGURE (the Balding Man) in a primitive looking
text: CLOTH MASK with the eyes cut out. The Figure WAITS,
dialog: 
text: motionless, poised, for a very long, disturbing beat... We
text: HEAR a PASSING TRAIN getting CLOSER... LOUDER...
text: Then, as the Kid brakes -- a TRAIN HORN BLARES -- and the
text: Figure LUNGES forward, JAMS the gear shaft into park with one
text: gloved hand -- uses the other to MASH a WET COTTON PAD over
text: the startled Kid’s nose and mouth! It’s messy, brutal --
text: CLOSE ON the FIGURE’S IMMOBILE, MASKED HEAD as the KID FLAILS
text: MADLY (0O.S.)! The utter terror in the Kid’s muffled SCREAMS
text: is excruciating -- like the primal squeal of an animal
text: experiencing the sudden, incomprehensible realization it is
text: being slaughtered. It goes on way too long. Finally, he
text: QUIETS; from behind the mask we hear HEAVY, RAPID BREATHING --
text: as the breathing starts to slow, we CUT TO:
scene_heading: HIGH ANGLE - OUTSIDE THE CAR - AT A TRAIN CROSSING
text: AN AMTRAK TRAIN finishes passing in front of the Datsun,
text: stopped on a sleepy, two lane road; no other cars are around.
text: The CROSSING GATES LIFT, but the car doesn’t move... CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE ABANDONED DATSUN - LATER
text: On a SECLUDED, MOUNTAIN ROAD; the driver door is ajar. PAN
text: SLOWLY to a SNOWY HILLSIDE WOOD beside the road. We HEAR
text: RUSTLING SOUNDS from within the TREES up the steep incline...
speaker_heading: IN THE WOOD
text: Partially OBSCURED BY TREES, we SEE the SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KID
text: SUSPENDED BY HIS FEET on a ROPE, SLUNG over a TREE BRANCH.
text: Now in a CLEAR, PLASTIC RAIN SLICKER, still wearing his mask,
text: the Balding Man finishes hoisting the boy’s body, pulling the
text: rope with all his strength, grunting, panting hard --
text: CLOSE ON the DUFFLE: The Man reaches in, pulls out a FOLDING
text: HUNTING KNIFE(looking a lot like a much scarier version of

text: CLOSE PROFILE ON the UP-SIDE-DOWN, SILHOUETTED HEAD of the
text: BOY: BREATH steams gently from his nostrils; he is still
text: alive, but heavily sedated. The Man ENTERS FRAME, crouched
text: on his knees, moves in close to the Boy’s face. He opens the
text: knife, presses it delicately against the Boy’s neck -- then,
text: all at once, THRUSTS the knife upward, PUNCTURING an artery!
text: We watch in SILHOUETTE as BLOOD DRAINS in a THICK, THROBBING
text: STREAM... TIP DOWN to see it FILLING the PLASTIC JUG below.
dialog: 
text: Nearby FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH in the snow -- startled, the Man
text: turns to see A DEER, watching him. They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: TIMECUT TO:
scene_heading: THE WOOD - MINUTES LATER
text: The Man is carefully re-packing his duffle. He has removed
text: the cloth mask; his face is red, sweaty, his eyes have a far
text: away look. He looks numb. Bitter.
text: He reaches down, picks up the plastic jug, now filled with
text: blood. Walking back toward the duffle, he gently pulls the
text: funnel out of the jug, just starts to screw on a lid WHEN --
text: HIS LEG SINKS SHARPLY through the snow into a hole hidden
text: below -- he loses balance, DROPS the JUG -- it goes TUMBLING
text: DOWN the HILLSIDE -- ! He scrambles up, and runs lamely down
text: the hill after it; he EMERGES ONTO --
scene_heading: THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN ROAD
text: near the Boy’s abandoned car. The mostly EMPTY JUG sits on
text: its side in the street, BLOOD POOLING around it. The Man
text: stares at it, devastated, out of breath, in pain, AS --
scene_heading: DISTANT HEADLIGHTS
text: appear way down the road -- the Man turns to see A SNOW PLOW
text: heading this way. Panicked, he hobbles over, grabs the jug,
text: and clambers back up the hill, DISAPPEARING into the woods
text: OVER THIS we HEAR as HUSHED, MENACING VOICE:

scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - NIGHT

text: As he lunges forward with the knife, we PAN with him to
text: reveal his “victim” -- A TREE. He THRUSTS his knife into the
text: bark with all of his might. Again. And again. Finally, he
text: stops. As he catches his breath, he suddenly feels a chill,
text: as if someone is there -- he turns to see:
text: THE NEW NEIGHBOR GIRL, standing on the jungle gym, watching
text: him, expressionless. Up close, her face looks tired, a
text: bit... malnourished. Her hair looks like it hasn’t been
text: washed in a very long time. Her clothes look old, ill-
dialog: fitting, like they could have come from the Good Will.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (suddenly embarrassed)
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: (then)

text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: I live next door.

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Just so you know, I can’t be your
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: ...Why? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Does there have to be a reason?
dialog: That’s just the way it is.

text: But she’s already gone into the building.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Owen sticks his key in the front door lock when he hears
text: FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairwell; they have an ODD CADENCE.
text: Owen turns as the Balding Man appears, LIMPING up the steps
text: with his duffle. Their eyes meet briefly. Then Owen opens
text: his door, disappears inside.
text: The Man continues towards us; as he passes Owen’s door, he
text: STOPS for a moment, stares at it... then moves on; CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR
text: Owen has his eye pressed to the peephole, breathing through
text: his mouth, trying to be very quiet. He slowly backs away,
text: LISTENING to the Man’s IRREGULAR FOOTSTEPS... the door next
text: door CREAKS OPEN... then THUDS SHUT.
scene_heading: INT. OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Owen is taking off his jacket, when he starts to hear
text: MUFFLED, INDECIPHERABLE YELLING coming through the wall from
text: the neighbors’ apartment. He jumps slightly as he hears a
text: SUDDEN, STIFLED CRASH, and a THUD. The YELLING CONTINUES.
text: Concerned, Owen moves apprehensively toward the wall, PRESSES
text: HIS EAR TO IT... The yelling becomes a bit more intelligible
text: -- but it is not clear whose voice it is -- there’s something
text: unsettling, almost FEROCIOUSLY INHUMAN about it -- maybe it’s
text: just acoustics, or the way it distorts through Owen’s wall:
speaker_heading: VOICE (THROUGH WALL)
dialog: (near-hyperventilation)
dialog: ..-SUPPOSED TO DO? AM I SUPPOSED
text: TO GO OUT AND DO IT MYSELF?! HUH?!
dialog: (long pause; then:)
dialog: SAY SOMETHING!!!
text: Owen listens, on pins and needles, as the argument goes
text: SILENT for a LONG MOMENT... we can just barely make out
text: someone HYPERVENTILATING...
speaker_heading: HOLD.

text: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL
text: We are CLOSE on the Balding Man, who sits at a table, looking
text: down, quietly despondent; all of the gear from his duffle --
text: including the empty, blood-stained jug -- is scattered across
text: the floor behind him like it has been hurled there. We are
text: shooting PAST THE ARM of an OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE (could it be
text: the GIRL???), standing in FOREGROUND -- the Figure is
text: HYPERVENTILATING, waiting for a response.
text: The Balding Man glances up at the Figure, then looks down
text: again, bitterly ashamed. Finally, almost inaudibly, he says:
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: ..-Forgive me.
text: Exasperated, the Figure STORMS OFF, WIPING THROUGH FRAME...
dialog: We CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: OWEN
text: his ear still against the wall, anxiously waiting for more.

scene_heading: A MOVING SHOT, DOWN A CROWDED MIDDLE SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING
text: We're WITH OWEN as he passes through THRONGS of ARRIVING
text: STUDENTS -- there’s a HUSHED EXCITEMENT coursing through the

text: gathering in CLUSTERS outside the ADMINISTRATION OFFICE,
text: whispering to each other, spying into the windows --
text: As Owen reaches them, he PEERS, with the others, INTO THE
text: OFFICE WINDOWS: in the waiting area are several UNIFORMED
text: POLICE OFFICERS. Their expressions are grave. One talks to
text: a woman who looks like she could be the PRINCIPAL. Behind
text: the counter, SECRETARIES are crying.
text: A MAN’S VOICE interrupts, from behind the kids:
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: ‘Scuse me, fellas -- can I get
dialog: through here?
text: Owen turns -- IT’S THE SMALL TOWN PLAINCLOTHES COP FROM THE
text: OPENING OF THE FILM. The group parts to let him into the

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL (V.O.)
dialog: As some of you may have heard, there

text: The ENTIRE STUDENT BODY listens to the PRINCIPAL as she speaks
text: at a podium. The PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN stands behind her
text: with the other UNIFORMED COPS and VARIOUS FACULTY on stage.

dialog: I know many of you knew Scottie. He

text: ON OWEN, in the crowd, his backpack cradled in his lap:
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
dialog: The police assure me that everything
dialog: possible is being done to find those
dialog: responsible for this tragedy, but in
dialog: the mean time, we should all be on the
dialog: lookout for any suspicious activity...
text: Owen HEARS a STRANGLED LAUGH -- he peeks behind him to see
text: KENNY, MARK and DONALD, a couple rows back; they’re quietly
text: joking around, unmoved by the proceedings. Donald suddenly

text: DOWN in his seat, hiding from their view --
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
dialog: Your safety is our number one concern.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A FRONT PAGE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE ABOUT THE MURDER

speaker_heading: OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
dialog: And I don’t want you going outside
dialog: the complex when you get home
dialog: either -- not until they catch this

text: OF BLOODY, SEVERED HEADS, with names scrawled underneath:
text: “KENNY”, “MARK”, “DONALD”; he smiles.
speaker_heading: OWEN’S MOTHER (0.S.)
text: Finally, Owen finds an empty page -- he slips the new article

speaker_heading: THE COURTYARD

text: WINDOWS of the apartment next to his... no signs of life...
scene_heading: JUNGLE GYM - LATER
text: Owen sits by himself, playing with a RUBIK’S CUBE, struggling
text: with it. After a long beat, A FIGURE comes up quietly behind
text: him, sits on the jungle gym. It’s the GIRL. Owen can tell
text: she’s there, but doesn’t turn. Finally, she speaks:
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Oh, it’s you again, huh?

speaker_heading: GIRL

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: -..This?
text: She nods, defensive. He looks at her like it’s so obvious:
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: It’s a Rubik’s Cube.
dialog: (then, is she nuts?)
dialog: You don’t know Rubik’s Cube?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Is it a puzzle?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Yeah... Wanna try?

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: .+-You smell kinda funny.
text: And she looks quite ill. So pale. Frail. She glances up,

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (eyes on the puzzle)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I dunno. I don’t really get cold.
text: Beat. He watches her, so absorbed in the Cube. After a

text: So he starts to walk away... watching her... tentative...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: ...See you tomorrow then...
text: And as Owen heads off, WE STAY WITH THE GIRL, totally focused

text: doubles over, in excruciating pain... We HOLD on her, as she

text: Finally, she lifts her head. BLOOD STREAMS DOWN HER FACE.
text: She looks haunted, disturbed. Then, in one swift move, she
text: reaches down, and TWISTS HIS HEAD SHARPLY, SNAPPING HIS NECK.
text: She gets up, looks around to see if anyone has seen. No one
text: is around. And she runs off, her body again moving just like
text: a little girl’s -- seeming frightened, vulnerable, fragile...

scene_heading: JACK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

text: we start to HEAR MUFFLED ARGUING -- REVEAL:
speaker_heading: OWEN
text: He takes his eye away from the telescope, and turns toward
text: his BEDROOM WALL. The new neighbors are fighting again. He
text: moves closer, climbing onto his bed to listen, concerned.
text: This time it definitely sounds like THE FATHER is the one
text: YELLING... the words are INDECIPHERABLE. As Owen presses
text: his ear to the wall, he can BARELY make out a FEW FRAGMENTS:
speaker_heading: BALDING MAN (THROUGH WALL)
dialog: ...EXPECT ME TO CLEAN IT UP NOW,
dialog: DON’T YOU...!
speaker_heading: (more INDECIPHERABLE
dialog: WORDS; then:)
dialog: .. BITCH!
text: There’s a SUDDEN LOUD BANG! Owen jerks away from the wall,

text: gets up slowly, moves to THE WINDOW, PEERS DOWN AT:
speaker_heading: THE COURTYARD
text: After a moment, there is ANOTHER BANG (a DOOR SLAM) at the

scene_heading: A FROZEN LAKE - NIGHT
text: Large, expansive, still... We HEAR WATER TRICKLING; PAN TO:
text: THE SHORELINE. Where fresh water from a SMALL AQUEDUCT PIPE
text: flows into an opening in the ice... The Balding Man DRAGS
text: JACK’S BODY through the snow toward the opening... it’s tough
dialog: work with his bad leg, and Jack was a big man. Finally, the
text: Balding Man HEAVES THE BODY into the water. It FLOATS.
text: Winded, angry, the Balding Man finds a LONG STICK, and
text: presses it into Jack’s chest. He limps precariously along
text: the edge of the shore, GUIDING the FLOATING BODY with the
text: stick toward the SOLID ICE...
text: As it reaches the perimeter, the Balding Man THRUSTS the
text: stick against the body, attempting to submerge it under the

text: CLOSE ON THE RUBIK’S CUBE. It rests on the jungle gym,
text: covered in fresh snow. Owen picks it up, brushes it off to
text: see, IT IS COMPLETELY SOLVED. Owen is stunned. He looks up
text: at the BOARDED UP WINDOWS. Turns back to the Cube, OVERJOYED.
scene_heading: EXT. OWEN’S MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING
text: We TRACK with OWEN as he walks along the CHAIN LINK FENCE

dialog: You have to start with the

text: Paying no attention to the movie, Owen sits, copying
text: something out of a BOOK: it’s the MORSE CODE ALPHABET. He
text: writes out the dots and dashes for each corresponding letter
dialog: with a certain intensity, an urgency...
text: Across the room, Kenny sits with a long, broken-off
text: RETRACTABLE CAR ANTENNA in his hand -- smiling slyly, he
text: stretches the antenna out to its full length, reaches over,
text: taps the shoulder of A CHUBBY GIRL WITH GLASSES in the next

text: Girl turns, annoyed, can’t figure out who’s tapping her...
text: Pleased, Kenny turns, looking for his next victim, when he
text: spots Owen, on the other side of the room, copying... The
text: sight of Owen so deeply immersed in something somehow irks
text: Kenny; he stares at him darkly, wondering what he’s up to...
text: HOLD on Owen as he writes... He starts to bounce his leg,
text: anxious, excited... He pinches his crotch reflexively...

text: There is a KNOCK at the stall door... Owen remains perfectly
text: still... Then, a loud BANGING... Finally, Owen flushes,
text: unlocks the door, opens it, steps slowly --

text: As he sees Owen, the Balding Man slows to a stop, stares

speaker_heading: BALDING MAN
dialog: You know... I was like you once...
text: Owen stares at him, uncomfortable. Then, even more quiet:

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: ...Is... Abby home...?

scene_heading: THE CANDY COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Abby stands VOMITING VIOLENTLY, bent over against the side of

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: -.-Sorry.
text: Owen looks at her there, seeming so thin, so frail, so broken

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: I dunno... I guess so...
text: As she listens, Abby’s EYES DRIFT to OWEN’S BARE NECK -- so_
text: tantalizingly close to her mouth... Her PUPILS WIDEN subtly,

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: ...Why?
text: She smiles sadly, recovering; looks down at her shoes, shakes

speaker_heading: HOLD.

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: ..-May I come in...?

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I don’t... know what to do...

dialog: What would you like me to do...?

text: then... KNOCKS forcefully. He waits, heart racing...
text: Nothing. He turns away, maybe relieved... until... a KNOCK

scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
text: Abby opens the door slowly, looking healthier than she has

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Can I come in...?
text: She smiles, a bit wary, nods. He is about to enter; then:
speaker_heading: OWEN

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yeah... Maybe... Looks like a guy

speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Did he have a daughter? Like the
dialog: girl you described?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I don’t... I don’t know. I’ve

speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT’D)
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: You think this is related to the

dialog: But then... slowly... something starts to happen... her

dialog: No! Stop! You can come IN!
text: Abby suddenly relaxes her muscles, relieved. Panicked, Owen

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: What if I didn’t say anything...?
dialog: Would you have just kept bleeding...?

speaker_heading: POLICEMAN (0.S.)
dialog: HELLO...?!
text: The Policeman appears in the doorway to the kitchen, RIGHT
text: NEXT to where Owen’s back is pressed -- we can see them both,
dialog: but they cannot see each other...!
text: Owen holds his breath, can feel the Policeman standing
text: nearby... The Policeman GAZES in... then... moves on...
dialog: 
text: Owen listens as he passes... then, he gathers courage, darts
text: his head near the door jam and PEEKS:
text: INTO THE DINING ROOM
text: where the Policeman continues his sweep... He spots BOXES on
text: the side of the room, peers in, but it’s too dark to see...
text: Owen watches with just one eye past the door frame as the
text: Policeman takes a hand off his gun, and reaches up to the
text: cardboard and blankets covering the window -- he YANKS a
text: small section away, LETTING SOME LIGHT into the room...
dialog: 
text: The Policeman looks back in the boxes, sees the WALLETS,
text: WATCHES, and CASH... Then he sees SOMETHING BALLED UP on the
text: floor, nudges it into the light with his foot -- it’s ABBY’S
text: BLOOD DRENCHED CLOTHING; the Policeman looks at the blood
text: with growing alarm, imagining the worst -- he puts both hands
text: firmly back on his gun -- fear creeping into his voice:
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: HELLO...?!
text: Owen watches in horror as --
speaker_heading: THE POLICEMAN

speaker_heading: OWEN
text: LEANS his head out into the darkened hallway, watching the

speaker_heading: AT THE DOOR
text: The Policeman listens for noise from inside, hears nothing...
text: He reaches a hand down to the KNOB, gently grips it... tries
text: to TURN it slowly... it MOVES...
text: ALL AT ONCE, he FLINGS OPEN THE DOOR, GRIPS HIS GUN IN BOTH
dialog: HANDS, AND GAZES IN -- !
text: It’s even DARKER inside... He REACHES A HAND IN, feeling
text: around for a light switch -- finds one, FLICKS IT: nothing...
text: So finally, he STEPS ABRUPTLY --
speaker_heading: INSIDE
text: looks around, trying to see in the darkness... As his eyes
text: adjust slightly, he can just make out --
scene_heading: AN OLD, STAINED BLANKET
text: spread over the top of the BATHTUB... He leans in closer,
text: still holding the gun... the STAINS look like BLOOD.
text: He reaches a hand free from his gun, and quickly LIFTS off
text: the blanket... underneath are MORE BLANKETS, wrapped around
text: something in the tub -- something shaped like a BODY...
text: The Policeman quickly PEELS those back too -- revealing ABBY.
text: He stares at her, moves his face close, cannot tell if she is
text: dead or alive... He glances above the tub, now able to see
text: that the BATHROOM WINDOW is thoroughly covered with CARDBOARD
text: and BLANKETS, SEALED along the sill with ELECTRICAL TAPE...
text: He reaches a hand up, feeling for the edge of the tape --
text: finds it -- and -- JUST AS he STARTS TO TEAR IT BACK --
text: LETTING A TINY BIT OF LIGHT IN -- A VOICE CRIES OUT -- AT THE

scene_heading: BLOOD SPRAYING as ABBY FEASTS GRUESOMELY, VICIOUSLY --

scene_heading: OWEN’S HELP -- !

text: to the HORRIBLE SCREAMING AND BANGING from behind the door...
text: It’s unbearable -- he TURNS AWAY, TREMBLING...
text: Finally, he has to cover his ears...

text: Abby walks up behind him, puts her arms gently around his

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Thanks...
speaker_heading: TIMECUT TO:
scene_heading: THE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Owen... I have to go away...
text: Owen looks at her, at a loss, vulnerable... knows she’s
dialog: right... but can’t even nod...
text: She stares into his eyes... it’s excruciating...
text: Then, she leans slowly toward him, and for the first time,
text: despite her blood-drenched lips, they KISS... a long, last,
dialog: tender embrace...
text: Finally, they part, blood now on Owen’s lips too... He stares
