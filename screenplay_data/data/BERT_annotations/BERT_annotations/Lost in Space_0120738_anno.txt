speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What are you grinning at?
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: I just found an upside to this

speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: Major, you are aware Earth's resources
dialog: are severely limited.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Every schoolchild knows our recycling

speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: What I am about to tell you is
dialog: classified. Every schoolchild
dialog: has been lied to. The recycling
dialog: technologies have failed. In
dialog: less than two decades Earth will be
dialog: unable to support human life.
speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: We spun the ad campaign to give the
dialog: mission a friendly face, keep people
dialog: from panicking in the streets. We
dialog: partnered with Coke because the 900
dialog: billion this mission cost would have
dialog: bankrupted the government. The
dialog: SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth
dialog: as well as we do. They hope to reach
dialog: Alpha Prime first - And if they do,
dialog: I guarantee you, they will not share
dialog: the Dimondium with Western Demons like
dialog: us. our crops will wither. We will be
dialog: left to die.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: ...Captain Daniels doesn't have the

speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: Daniels was murdered in his apartment

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Dan was a good pilot. A good man.
speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: Your rescue stunt over Mars was

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: You endangered a one billion dollar

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: The cryosleep systems are running at

speaker_heading: GENERAL

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Doctor Smith is base physician. I am

speaker_heading: GENERAL
dialog: Absolutely, Doctor.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Judy, I'd like you to meet Major

speaker_heading: DOCTOR

speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: (to Smith)
dialog: Thank you.

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: You are a good woman, Maureen. Any man

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: MAUREEN

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Judy? Where's Judy?
text: Just then Judy emerges through a door, zipping up her flight suit.
speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JUDY
text: Vitals are normal. Pulse and

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JUDY

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: WEST

speaker_heading: WEST
text: It's gone.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No. Go back in front of it.
scene_heading: EXT.-JUPITER TWO
text: As the ship moves back in front of the portal, the hole in space is

speaker_heading: JOHN
text: It's a hole in space. A doorway.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: A doorway to where?
speaker_heading: JOHN

text: On its hull, under the legend PROTEUS, an American flag.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: I've never seen a design like this.
dialog: what are those scales on her hull?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: How could Earth launch a ship this

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: These scanners are damaged, I'm
dialog: getting inconsistent life signs but

speaker_heading: JOHN

scene_heading: EXT.-SPACE
text: The Jupiter Two heads towards the giant ship.
scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Can you give me some light on the

text: A smaller docking ring is illuminated on the viewscreen.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: What do you make of that?
text: Attached to the starboard docking ring is another, smaller craft. Its

speaker_heading: MAUREEN

scene_heading: EXT.-SPACE

speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Crush! Kill! Destroy!

text: He pulls a tiny mic from his deck. Lifts it to his lips.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Crush. Kill. Destroy.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Crush! Kill! Destroy!
text: Will points to several jury-rigged modifications.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I hacked into his CPU, bypassed his

text: All stare at him. Penny finally speaks.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Show off.
scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO-CREW QUARTERS-LATER
text: Penny stands guard, a rifle in her hand, talking into her recorder.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: And so the Space Captive finds
dialog: herself helping the Robinsons by

text: Penny's VOICE trails off. Stares out the porthole. Endless space.
speaker_heading: PENNY
text: She finds that out here, in the dark
text: and cold, she's scared, and she's
dialog: kind of glad they're all together.
text: Just then Don approaches, a silver bundle under his arm.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Identify yourself, soldier.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: West, Major, United Space Force,

text: Penny steps aside.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Proceed Major West.

speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Ouch. Could he be cuter? I don't
dialog: think so.
scene_heading: INT.-SMITH'S CELL
text: Actually a med-lab. Smith turns to face Don an he ENTERS.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: These quarters are totally

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: We're going to check out the probe
dialog: ship. Maybe we can figure out how
dialog: they got here. And how to get home.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Ta-ta. Have a wonderful trip.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: You're coming with us.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Out of the question. I'm a doctor not
dialog: a space explorer. You and-
text: But Don is in his face in a heartbeat.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: What you are is a murderous saboteur
dialog: and I am not leaving you on this ship
dialog: so you can do more harm than you've
dialog: already caused.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I absolutely refuse-
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: (closer)
dialog: Give me an excuse to kill you.
dialog: Please.
text: Smith stares at him a beat. Then he smiles, looks to the flight suit.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Silver always was my color.
scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO-LOWER DECKS
text: Will stands in front of the Robot, polishing a blast mark clean.
speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: GUN
text: Voiceprint confirmed. Rifle is

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You did a good job up there son. You

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Thanks.
text: An awkward silence hangs between them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I know I haven't around much these
dialog: days.That we haven't had time to-
speaker_heading: WEST (OVER)
dialog: Professor, we're ready.
text: John looks at his boy Will in silent.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Will, you're the most important thing
dialog: in the world to me. I hope one day
dialog: you'll be able to see that.
text: With that, John walks out. Will stares after him. Faces the Robot.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Take care of my dad, okay Robot?
text: Will works his remote, sending the Robot towards the bridge.
scene_heading: INT.-PROBE SHIP
text: A long dark corridor. Slowly the ambient lights come up. A door opens
text: to reveal Smith, John, Don, Judy and the Robot, stepping out of the
text: docking chamber, the airlock closing in the b.g.
speaker_heading: JUDY
text: The air is stale. Old.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: That's the smell of ghosts.
text: Don walks to a computer panel set into the wall. Begins typing.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: I'm interfacing with the on board
dialog: computer... Odd.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Not working?
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: No, it's just, I don't know, too
text: fast. Most of the systems are down.
text: The Robot rolls deeper into the alien ship. The others follow. More
text: lights flicker into life, illuminating the long corridor ahead.
speaker_heading: JUDY
text: Motion sensors are still working.
speaker_heading: WEST (OVER)
dialog: What do you make of this?
text: Smith, John and Judy join Don at one of the bulkhead walls.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: Some kind of hieroglyphics.
text: WALL-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphics are scrawled on the hull wall.
text: The sketches tell a story.
text: HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The alien craft docks with the giant ship.
text: SECOND HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE-A trio of inhuman bipedal stick figures enter
text: the giant ship.
text: THIRD HIEROGLYPH-CLOSE. The shape of a sun or a disc, from which juts

speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: If I didn't know better I'd say this

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I know an omen when I see one. I
text: suggest a hasty retreat.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Just imagine we're retreating in the
dialog: opposite direction. Now, move it.
text: Don shoves Smith forward with the butt of his laser rifle, the group
text: heading deeper into the quiet ship.
scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO
text: Will watches through the Robot's POV, toggling to move the automaton
text: forward. A readout marked AUDIO flashes. Will turns up a volume
text: control. (OVER) the sound of a slow, steady DRIP.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Dad, do you....
scene_heading: INT.-PROBE SHIP
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: ... Hear something?
text: The Robot turns, begins heading further down the corridor. (OVER) now
text: DRIPPING can be heard by all.
speaker_heading: SMITH
text: Like the drip, drip, drip of blood..
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: You really need to shut up.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Here.
text: THE CEILING shows a jagged hole, covered with some kind of viscous
text: membrane, leading to the dark of a service tunnel above. The membrane
text: DRIPS steadily onto the floor below.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: That material appears biological.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Nothing good will come of this.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: What makes you such an expert?
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Trust me, Major. Evil knows evil.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Let's find the bridge. Maybe we can

speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Damn.
scene_heading: INT.-SHIP-WALKING
text: The boarding party stand at the end of the corridor. Don presses a
text: wall panel. The giant doors hiss open to REVEAL...
scene_heading: INT.-MAIN BRIDGE
text: Immense. Empty. And battle torn. Sections of the controls have been
text: blown away. Blast scoring mars the walls.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: What the hell happened in here?
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Some kind of fire fight. Look at this
dialog: technology. I've seen some of this
text: before. On the drawing boards.
text: Smith has moved off slightly, wandered over to a STORAGE ALCOVE.
text: Within, a row of docked Robots, larger and sleeker then ours.
text: John and Don are powering up the Com, console lights coming on.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Can you bring up the Captain's log?
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: The data has degraded. I'm going try
dialog: and gather any fragments I can. There
dialog: isn't much, but ... here we go.
text: MAIN SCREEN-CLOSE. Fills with snow. Then a figure can be seen. It's

speaker_heading: JEB

speaker_heading: JEB

speaker_heading: WEST

dialog: totally corrupted.
text: IN THE ALCOVE, Smith frees a power pack from one of the robots. Slips
text: it into the sleeve cuff of his field suit.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: This doesn't make sense. How could
dialog: they launch a rescue mission for us
dialog: when we've only been lost a day?
text: Judy stands by the life sciences panel.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I've got something here.
text: A turning holograph appears over the console panel. A degraded image
text: of a trembling, viscous pouch. Tiny shapes move within.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: They brought it up from the planet's
dialog: surface. It's seems to be some sort
dialog: of egg sack.
text: Don notices Smith's standing in the storage alcove.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Smith, step away from there.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Happy to oblige, Major. Although I
dialog: don't think it's me you should be

scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO
text: Will is at his station, watching Don and John via the Robot's POV.
speaker_heading: WILL

scene_heading: INT.-PROBE SHIP BRIDGE

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: After it. Move.
dialog: (to the Robot)
dialog: Bring Smith.
scene_heading: INT.-PROBE SHIP-CORRIDOR
text: Don races down the corridor. The walls are matted with flowering
text: plants. Vines twist into a carpet covering the metallic floor.
text: THE SCURRYING SHAPE, about the size of a small dog, shoots out from
text: behind a bulkhead, disappearing into the lush greenery.
text: Don pushes forward through the ever deepening brush until he comes to
text: a door. A plaque reads HYDROPONICS LAB. He races inside.
scene_heading: INT.-HYDROPONICS LAB
text: A jungle. John and Judy arrive behind Don.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: This explains where all the plants
dialog: came from.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Growth like this would take decades.
text: The Robot arrives through the lab door, carrying Smith in one claw.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Unhand me, you mechanical moron.
text: Don's eyes fix behind Smith's head.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Don't move.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I am sick of your terrorism. If you
dialog: are going to kill me, be done with
dialog: it. Otherwise I will insist you treat
dialog: me with the respect and-
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: (like steel)
dialog: I said don't move.
text: Smith is suddenly silent. Don's hand shoots out, just missing Smith's
text: head, disappearing into the brush behind him, leaves flying, as-he
text: pulls from its hiding place a small creature.
text: About the size of a large stuffed bear, spiny skin going from leaf
text: color to red, shaped like a rhesus monkey but covered with the scales
text: of a tiny dragon and bright yellow cat's eyes.
scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO
text: Will is watching through the Robot's eyes.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Neat.
scene_heading: INT.-PROBE SHIP-HYDROPONICS GARDEN
text: West stares down at the creature in his hand, now a calmer and more
text: friendly blue. Judy approaches.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Well, who do we have here?
text: As the beast struggles in Don's hand it changes color, chameleon like,
text: trying to hide. No luck. Don holds fast.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Easy there, little buddy. No one's
dialog: going to hurt you.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: How do you know it won't hurt us?
text: Don has begun stroking the creature's head. After a beat, the small
text: beast begins to COO and emit small BLIPPING sounds.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Looks like you've made a friend. You
dialog: have a good bedside manner, Major.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: I'm going to let that one go.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: How charming. Doctor Dolittle of
dialog: outer space.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Where do you think it came from?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It's possible this is one of the
dialog: creatures represented in the
text: hieroglyphs we saw on the wall. It
dialog: must have been their ship attached to
text: the other docking ring.
text: The beast has moved onto Don's shoulder, is now clutching there,
text: burying its tiny face into his neck. Don can't help but LAUGH.
speaker_heading: WEST
text: It looks like a child.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: If so, my dear Major, what do you
dialog: suppose happened to its parents?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Let's get back to the bridge.
text: As they leave, a dark shape skitters across the ceiling in the

speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: That's strange.

speaker_heading: PENNY

scene_heading: INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE
text: John is at the Com.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I've tapped into the internal sensor

speaker_heading: SMITH
text: A ghost ship.
text: Don is sitting with the tiny creature. He pulls a ration pack from his
text: pocket. Turns it over in his hand.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: And the flavor of the day is ...
dialog: banana/beef. Who thinks up these
dialog: combinations?
text: The creature stares at him intently as he tears open the foil lip,
text: sucks a bit LOUDLY. Judy can't help but smile at him.
speaker_heading: WEST
text: MM. Good.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Major West, I highly recommend you
dialog: never breed. That by the way is my
dialog: medical opinion.
text: Don glares at him, hands the tiny creature the pouch. The creature

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Little thing was hungry.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Good Lord, who will - spare us the

speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Do you hear something?
text: Suddenly the creature begins to SCREAM, leaping on Smith's back,
text: clinging to his neck for dear life.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Get this infernal creature off me.
text: The WHINE is growing louder. it seems to be coming from above.
text: THE CEILING-CLOSE. There, in the corner, the membrane covering the

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: This can't be good.

scene_heading: EXT.-PROBE SHIP

scene_heading: INT.-PROBE SHIP-BRIDGE
text: The lizard monkey's SCREAMING has reached new heights of hysteria. A

text: What bursts in is a monster out of nightmare. Nearly half the size of
text: a human, shiny metallic body from which wet, spider-like limbs extend.
text: A fang covered vAw opens below ravenous, green eyes.
text: Don draws his laser and FIRES, but the blast only reflects off the

speaker_heading: JOHN

scene_heading: INT.-PROBE SHIP
text: The Robot is holding up the rear, its torso swiveled backwards so it
text: can retreat and FIRE simultaneously.
text: The Robot's plasma BLASTS have more effect than-the lasers, blowing
text: the spiders into tiny pieces of inhuman flesh and metal.
text: But more monsters are pouring through the holes in the corridor
text: ceiling, some giving chasing, others swarming injured comrades.
text: Judy watches as several spiders devour their fallen brethren.
speaker_heading: JUDY

scene_heading: DON-CLOSE. Impressed.

scene_heading: INT.-PROBE SHIP-DOCKING BAY
text: Don activates the airlock to the Jupiter, the batch slowly opening.
text: The Robot stands in the doorway to the docking bay, FIRING at the

text: towards them now like a single, shifting mass of death.
speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: WEST

scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO

scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO-AIRLOCK
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Seal it. Now!

text: dropping airlock door. Smith recoils from the swiping talon.
text: SMITH'S BACK-CLOSE. A tiny rand and beneath, a razor thin incision.
text: THE DOOR drops, the spider's arm, still twitching, severed inside the

scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Get this cloying gargoyle off of me.

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Get it off me. Get it off.
text: Penny in frantically wiping the hair from her face. The tiny creature

text: Don releases the docking ring, glances at the Monitor. The hull of the

speaker_heading: WEST
text: Initiating separation.
text: LIZARD MONKEY'S EYES widen in terror as the ship SHAKES, burying its

speaker_heading: WEST

scene_heading: EXT.-JUPITER TWO
text: The hull glows with electricity. The spiders fly off into space, their

speaker_heading: WEST
text: And the crowd goes wild.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Recall your nightmares from
dialog: childhood, Major. Monsters are rarely

text: ON SCREEN-The spiders shoot webs from their bellies, attaching to the

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Persistent bastards.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Can you hit them again?
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Every time I electrify the hull, I'm

speaker_heading: SMITH

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: About half the core material is

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Come on, Professor, give it a rest. I
dialog: was technically still in command.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Don't hand me that. I'm commander of
dialog: this mission.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Look, no offense, but you're an
dialog: egghead with an honorary rank. No one
dialog: ever intended you to handle combat
dialog: situations. You're spouting some
dialog: nonsense about- time travel while
dialog: those spiders posed a continuing
dialog: threat. I made a judgement call and
dialog: if I have to I'll make it again.
dialog: Hell, you of all people should
dialog: understand that. If your father were
dialog: here-
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: My father is not here. My father is
text: dead, killed in one of his combat
dialog: missions you so admire. My family is

dialog: Am I interrupting something?
text: WIDER. Maureen stands in the doorway.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: No. Really. I think you two should go

dialog: contest. So please, go for it. I'll
dialog: have Judy down here in a heartbeat to

speaker_heading: JOHN WEST

speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Not another word.

speaker_heading: PENNY

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: ...My God Smith, you're right. How

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Sarcasm is the recourse of a weak

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: I'm hiding the pain. Really.

speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I assure you, Major West. Your pain

dialog: right man for the job.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But solving the world's problems
dialog: doesn't leave much time for the
dialog: people you love, does it?
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Did you get any time with Will?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Now he's decided he can rebuild the
dialog: robot. Wants to show me his designs.
dialog: I've got too much to do-
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Funny creatures, men. You try so hard
dialog: not to be your fathers, end up making
dialog: the same mistakes. Will adores you.
dialog: He needs your attention.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We can't get off this planet much
dialog: less back on course. I don't have
dialog: time to...
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: John, just listen to him. it doesn't
dialog: matter what he's saying. Just listen.
dialog: Sometimes, at least in the eyes of
dialog: their fathers, little boys have to
dialog: come first.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: As soon as we get back into space,
dialog: we're going to spend some real time
dialog: together. I promise.
text: Maureen looks out the window. A long beat. Then she smiles.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: It's nice to have our family under
dialog: one roof. Even if we had to go half
dialog: way across the galaxy to manage it.
text: John presses a button, the blast shield opening to reveal the stacked
text: orbs of three glowing moons. Maureen smiles.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: How would you feel about a little
dialog: late night tutorial, Professor?
text: John moves to her, begins pulling her down, out of FRAME.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Mm. That's new. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Going for extra credit.
scene_heading: EXT.-JUPITER TWO-NIGHT
text: The ship sits on the alien landscape.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN (OVER)

speaker_heading: JOHN (OVER)

dialog: CHAPTER 17: The Core
scene_heading: --------------------
scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO-BRIDGE-MORNING
text: Will comes up on the elevator, rubbing his eyes, first awake in the
text: morning. He stumbles to the viewscreen.
text: WILL-CLOSE. His eyes widen with shock.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh man.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: A giant portal shimmers at snow's edge about 100 yards from the ship.
text: Beyond it, a sun-stained field of towering plants and trees.
scene_heading: INT.-BRIEFING ROOM
text: The crew gathers at the table. (OVER) a RUMBLING. The ship shakes.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: What are those rumblings? They've
dialog: been happening all morning.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: How can half the landscape have grown
dialog: up overnight?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Okay, let's get settled. Maureen?
text: MAUREEN'S MONITOR-CLOSE. A geothermal analysis shows the giant plates
dialog: that make up this world appear mismatched.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: It's impossible. But this planet's
text: geothermic plates don't match up.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I was afraid of this.
text: Al1 eyes turn to John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I think these tremors are the result
text: of opening and closing doorways.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Doorways to where?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The future.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Perhaps the Professor was hit on the
dialog: head when we landed.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Remember the portal that lead us to
dialog: the probe ship? What if we crossed a
dialog: into a time years after Earth sent a
dialog: rescue mission.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: You're not serious? Time travel is
dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No it's not. It's just improbable.
dialog: Like hyperdrive was a hundred years
dialog: ago. Nothing's really impossible.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This world could be riddled with
text: doorways to the future.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So if we walk into that forest
dialog: outside, we're really just walking
dialog: into this crater years from now.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Geological plates from different
dialog: times wouldn't fit together. That
dialog: would explain the tectonic mismatch.
dialog: But doorways in time, John?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: If these portals are opening and
text: closing, part of some cascading,
dialog: natural phenomenon, they could be
dialog: tearing this planet apart
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: These portals are exactly what I
dialog: predicted my time machine would do.
dialog: What if the doorways aren't natural?
dialog: A machine that bends space, like our
dialog: hyperdrive, could be modified to bend
dialog: time as well. What if someone on this
dialog: world has built a device?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Son, I appreciate your input but now
dialog: isn't the time for flights of fancy.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You never listen to me. Not ever.
text: And with that Will storms out. John stares after him a beat, sorely
text: wanting to follow. (OVER) another RUMBLE.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: There's no telling how long before
dialog: this planet breaks up entirely.
dialog: (rising).
dialog: Don and I are going to locate the
dialog: radioactive material for the core.
dialog: Get the ship ready to go. We may have
dialog: very little time.
scene_heading: INT. -BRIDGE
text: John, suited up, heads for the open front hatch when he spots Will
text: sitting alone in the Com chair, tinkering with his deck.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Aren't you coming out to say goodbye?
text: Will just shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You're always leaving. What if...
text: Will looks away, finally giving voice to his worst fear.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What if one time you don't come
dialog: home...
text: John stares at his son, unsure what to say, the boy's anguish so deep
text: and apparent. He reaches into his shirt, takes off his dog tags.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Whenever your grandfather went away
dialog: on a mission, held leave these with
dialog: me. For safe keeping. And when he got
dialog: home I d always be waiting to give
dialog: them back.
text: He lifts the chain and places it around the boy's neck.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm coming back Will. I promise.
text: Will is silent. John touches the boy's hair, then walks out. A beat.
text: Will looks up after his father, fingering the dog tags.
scene_heading: EXT.-JUPITER TWO
text: The Robinsons, all except Will, stand-gathered around the front of the
text: ship. Don has a small tracking device in his hand.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: I've got a fix on the radioactive
text: material. It's through the portal.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We'll just have to hope the doorways
dialog: remain stable.
speaker_heading: JUDY
text: These crater walls are disabling the
dialog: com-links. You won't be able to
text: communicate with the ship.
text: (OVER) the ground shakes again.
dialog: Maureen
dialog: Come home to me, Professor.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I love you, wife.
text: John kisses her. Don looks at Judy.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I'm going to regret saying this, But
text: try to get back in one piece.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: This is kind of a kiss for luck
dialog: occasion, wouldn't you agree, Doc?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: See. I'm regretting it already.
dialog: (coy)
dialog: Kisses have to be earned. Say
dialog: goodbye, Blip.
text: Blip reaches up and touches John's face. Then her CHIRPS form a rough
text: approximation of the words Penny taught her.
speaker_heading: BLIP
dialog: Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You take care of her, Penny.
dialog: (kisses her head)
dialog: Take care of you too, baby.
text: Then the two men bead off, towards the portal and forest beyond.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL
text: Smith stares out the cabin window. PUSH IN as
scene_heading: INT.-SMITH'S CELL
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Yes, enjoy your moments of trite
dialog: familial bonding.
text: He turns, heads back to his table, transformed now, into a makeshift
text: lab, the stolen control bolt in mid-modification.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Because they will be your last.
scene_heading: INT.-WILL'S CABIN
text: The beginnings of Will's home-made robot sits on the table. WILL is in
text: the f.g. riffling his PERSONAL CARGO container.
text: Penny ENTERS, an assortment of small electronic devices, hairclips,
text: and other metal and electronic objects. Dumps them on the table.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: That's everything even close to
dialog: nonessential. Even my bellybutton
dialog: ring.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Thanks, Pen.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: You want to come on a land survey?
text: But Will just shakes his head, sulky.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Look, what does dad know? Maybe
text: someone did build a time machine.
text: She ruffles his hair. Disappears. Will activates a CPU speaker.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
text: Robot is on line.
text: (OVER) a KNOCKING has begun. WILL looks up, puzzled.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It sounds like old morse code.
dialog: Chapter 18: Danger Will!
scene_heading: ------------------------
scene_heading: INT.-CORRIDOR
text: Will walks down the corridor. (OVER) The KNOCKING continues. Will
text: follows the SOUND until he comes to the door of Smith's prison.
text: Smith is visible through the door window, sitting at a table,
text: hammering out the code with his boot. He beckons Will inside.
text: Will shakes his head. Smith begins TAPPING again.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (sounding out the code)
dialog: Danger.
scene_heading: INT.-SMITH'S CELL
text: The door slides open and Will ENTERS, a laser pistol in hand.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You said someone is in danger.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: We all are. You are wise to arm
dialog: yourself.
text: Smith eyes the weapon, moving towards the boy.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: This gun is set to fire for me only
dialog: so don't try anything funny.
text: Smith barely misses a beat as he adjusts, passing the child, going
text: instead to the window and opening the blast shield.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: William, you misjudge me. I only want
dialog: to help you.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Help us? You tried to kill us all.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: But now our fates are intertwined. if
dialog: your father and that idiot West fail,
dialog: I will have no chance of getting
dialog: home. It is in my best interests they
dialog: succeed. And I always follow my best
dialog: interests.
text: Smith gazes out at the exotic terrain. (OVER) an inhuman WAIL.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: What monsters roam these alien wilds?
dialog: Fools. To set off blindly across this
dialog: savage land. Much as I hate to admit
dialog: it, it will be harder to manage
dialog: without them.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What are you talking about? They'll
dialog: be back. They'll be okay.
text: Smith is silent. A long, lethal beat.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Someone should go after them.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Will, I forbid it. You're a boy. A
dialog: clever one, certainly, but a child
dialog: nonetheless. This planet is likely
dialog: full of predators. Even if you found
dialog: them, what if they're hurt, ravaged,
dialog: dying, what good could you do?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But you're a doctor.
text: Smith turns away, hiding his smile.
scene_heading: EXT.-JUPITER TWO-DAY
text: Judy and Maureen are hanging on repelling lines before the crater
text: wall, shipping away ore that glitters like diamonds.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: It's impossible.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Not really. Geologists have
dialog: speculated that Dimondium might be
dialog: naturally occurring in many older
text: worlds. Part of a biosphere's way of
text: rejuvenating itself.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: This one is ten times more powerful
dialog: then that on Alpha Prime. There's
dialog: enough here to save Earth.
text: Penny stands in the f.g. with Blip on her arm, taking plant samples,
text: talking into her video recorder.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: After much deliberation, the Space
text: Captive has decided to accept her new
dialog: role as member of the crew. The
dialog: Robinsons, after all, can obviously
dialog: use her help...
text: Blip jumps up on Penny's arm, knocking her recorder to the ground.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: (flaring)
dialog: Now look what you've done. Stop
dialog: hanging all over me.
text: Blip stares at her, frightened by her tone, begins backing away to the
text: edge of the forest. She looks at Penny, then disappears into the thick
dialog: brush..
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Blip. Wait. I'm sorry. Damn.
text: Penny heads after the creature. HOLD on her recorder. Forgotten.
dialog: CHAPTER 19: A Different Future
scene_heading: ------------------------------
scene_heading: EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY
text: Will and Smith are walking down a forest path. The boy has a radiation
text: tracker in his hand.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I've got a fix on Dad's suit beacon.
text: Dead ahead is a field of beautiful, alien flowers, their purple leaves
text: moving in the wind like an azure sea.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Wow, that's Mom's favorite color.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: How droll.
text: (OVER) a tremendous RUMBLING. The WIND ROARS. Suddenly, the air in the
text: distance begins to twist, a rushing distortion sweeping towards them,
text: flowers growing, landscape aging rapidly within.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Run, child, run.
text: Smith turns, begins to flee, pulling Will with him, away from the
text: rushing warp. Smith trips, falls, closes his eyes, waiting for the
text: distortion to overtake him. A beat. He opens his eyes.
text: SMITH-POV. A glowing, stationary portal shimmers behind him, revealing
text: beyond a forest ever older, darker, more overgrown.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Will? Will?
text: No sign of the boy. Then, from behind a tree, Will appears.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Wow!
text: The field across the portal has is now a mass of giant plants, the
text: flowers a deep red. Will rushes across the rip in space.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: William, wait!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: See, over here I'm in the future.
dialog: (steps back towards Smith)
dialog: Here I'm in the past. Don't worry.
dialog: If my theories are correct, these
dialog: doorways should remain stable, for
dialog: a while anyway.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I can barely contain my glee. Why
dialog: aren't you aging like the plants?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's just an effect of the portals
dialog: forming. Once they stabilize you can
dialog: cross from one time to another
dialog: just like stepping between two
dialog: rooms.
dialog: (off his tracker)
dialog: Dad's signal is this way. Come on,
dialog: Doctor Smith.
text: Will takes Smith's hand, pulls him across the threshold.
text: SMITH-POV. Where he stands is now lush, the sky overhead a glowing
text: crimson. Yet behind him, the path in as it originally appeared.
text: Younger. The sky, bright. Will has run deeper into the brush.
text: Smith notices something by his feet. He clears away the brush,
text: revealing shapes beneath the foliage. His expression darkens.
speaker_heading: WILL (OVER)
dialog: What did you find?
text: Will has returned.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Come, come, son, no time for
dialog: distractions. Let's move on.
text: Smith shoves Will on, the boy unable to see what Smith saw.
text: PAN DOWN. Headstones. Each bears a marking, the names still legible.
text: Maureen, Penny and Judy Robinson.
scene_heading: EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-DAY-PRES
text: John and Don emerge from the brush. They have come to one of the
text: crater walls. John looks from the rock face to his tracker.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Damn? Damn is not good.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The radiation signature we've been
dialog: tracking. it's a ghost. A
dialog: reflection from the Jupiter Two
text: bouncing off the ore in these walls.
dialog: There's no core material here.
text: (OVER) a sudden RUMBLING. The ground shakes. The ROAR of WIND. A time
text: portal rushes towards them like a glittering maw, the side of the
text: crater aging and crumbling in it's wake.
text: John and Don race away from the distortion, ducking falling trees,
text: roll clear as the portal stabilizes, now a fixed doorway to a darker,
text: more deserted future.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The ship's back that way. we have to
dialog: go through.
scene_heading: EXT.-BRUSH-DAY-PRESENT
text: Penny is pushing through the forest.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Blip? I'm sorry. Blip?
text: She spots the tiny creature ahead in the distance. Blip SNIFFS the
text: ground, runs a few steps. SNIFFS again. Looks up. There, before Blip
text: is another glittering hole in time. The forest beyond is far thicker,
text: the sky red. Blip steps through the portal.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Blip, wait.
text: Penny goes to the edge of the portal, stares at the monstrously tall
text: trees beyond. A beat. Then she steps through, following.
scene_heading: EXT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE
text: Penny pushes through dwindling brush to a series of rocky overhangs
text: and caverns cut into the crater wall.
text: BLIP is standing over a large circular stone, hopping up and down,
text: CHIRPING and BLIPPING madly.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Blip, you can't run off like that.
dialog: (closing on the stone)
dialog: What the-?
text: THE STONE-CLOSE. A series of hieroglyphs are painted on the giant
text: rock, their images the same style as those on the probe ship.
text: HIEROGLYPH ONE-CLOSE. A mighty battle in space is depicted.
speaker_heading: PENNY (OVER)
text: Some kind of fight, in space. It
text: almost looks like the probe ship
text: Major West blew up.
text: HIEROGLYPH TWO-CLOSE. A fiery star falls to the planet's surface.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: That could be the Jupiter Two crash
dialog: landing.
text: HIEROGLYPH THREE-CLOSE. Here a dark haired beauty holds a single
text: lizard monkey aloft, her face remarkably like Penny's.
text: Suddenly BLIP begins to SHRIEK. (OVER) RUSTLING leaves.
text: SHAPES are moving in the trees, the vague outline of camouflaged forms
text: dropping to the ground. Five figures suddenly de-camouflage. Lizard
text: monkeys, two large, two smaller.
text: Directly in front of Penny, the largest monkey de-camouflages. Fully
text: grown, the beast is nearly twice Penny's height. Around the creature's
text: wrist is something odd. An old, tattered green ribbon.
text: BLIP begins to SCREAM and SHRIEK.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Blip, no!
text: Too late. Blip leaps on the giant creature, grabs the ribbon. The
text: beast could slap Blip away like a fly. But the creature doesn't
text: resist, just stares down at Blip with something akin to tenderness.
text: Blip looks at the ribbon in his hand. Then at the one around her
text: wrist. Save for their age difference., the ribbons are identical.
text: The giant monkey moves forward, closing on a petrified Penny, paw
text: reaching out, touching her face. The beast begins stroking Penny's
text: cheek in a familiar gesture of comfort.
speaker_heading: GIANT BLIP
dialog: Nice girl. Pretty girl. Nice.
text: Penny stares up in stunned wonder.
scene_heading: EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE
text: Don and John are crossing the brush. The terrain in growing ever more
text: desolate, desert like. The double suns hang on the horizon.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We should be able to see the ship.
text: Something catches the light on the ground beside them. Don reaches
text: down and lifts a small metal fragment in his hand.
text: METAL-CLOSE. On it is the familiar logo of the United Space Agency.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Could these be from the probe?
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: Corroded. This metal is decades old.
text: Don finds another piece of wreckage, turns it over in his hand.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: It's not possible.
text: WRECKAGE-CLOSE. The fragment bears a simple legend: Jupiter Two.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: What kind of nightmare is this?
dialog: Where the hell are we?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No, Major, when the hell are we?
text: Suddenly Don is hit in the chest with a plasma charge, goes flying.
text: John ducks and rolls, FIRING his laser from behind the cover of a
text: rocky mound. John goes up to take another SHOT, is bit with a powerful
text: electrical blast, falling hard. Still.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Rolling out from behind him, claws extended in attack Position and
text: apparently many years old, is a rebuilt Robot.
scene_heading: EXT.-PLANET'S SURFACE-EVENING-FUTURE
text: Will and Smith are crossing the alien terrain. The plants have given
text: way to desert. The suns hang low in the crimson sky.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I feel like we got turned around.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Just follow your father's signal,
dialog: young William.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh shit.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: A boy of your intelligence shouldn't
dialog: swear.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Look.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Oh. Shit, indeed.
text: REVERSE ANGLE. At the edge of the crater wall sits the wrecked hull of
text: the Jupiter Two. The lower sections are gone, the hull scarred, open
dialog: to the sun.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: JOHN-CLOSE. Stirring to consciousness.
speaker_heading: WIDER
scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO BRIDGE-FUTURE
text: Or what is left of it. Dark. The occasional COMPUTER panel flickers
text: Shattered monitors. An awful history-told in torn metal. John is
text: slumped in a corner, Don still on the floor beside him.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OVER)
dialog: Well, well. All things really do
dialog: come to he who waits.
text: A FIGURE sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What is this place?
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Why Professor, the shock must have
dialog: scrambled your brain. Look around
dialog: you. Don't you recognize the spot?
dialog: You've come home.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: This can't be...
text: But even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What have you done to the ship.
dialog: ...Where's my family?
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Your family is dead. Dead and in the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: What fickle consort in memory. Time
text: dims certain images while others
text: shine clear and bright as yesterday.
text: The figure stands, light hitting his face. Late thirties. Long blond
text: hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. Eerily familiar.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: I'll never forget that morning.
dialog: Twenty years ago. What was it you
dialog: said? I'll be back. I promise. But I
dialog: knew better. You never came home.
text: The figure walks to one of the burned out panels.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Without you, your family never had a
dialog: chance. A few spidersv survived the
text: destruction of the probe ship. They
dialog: reached the planet and attacked. I
text: can still hear the women scream.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Who are you?
text: The figure walks forward, into the light. Stands there a moment. Then
text: he lifts something hanging around his neck. Tarnished metal, old but
text: familiar. John's father's dog tags.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Don't you recognize me, Dad? It's
dialog: me. I'm your son. Will.
scene_heading: EXT.-CRATER CAVES-DAY
text: Maureen and Judy, lasers drawn, are pushing through the brush.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Penny? Penny?
text: The four lizard monkeys are kneeling in a circle around Penny.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Penny? Baby, are you alright?
text: Penny rises, steps forward, carrying Blip. The other beasts hang back,
text: their faces genuflecting, almost reverential.
speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: It's okay, Mom. They're not going to
dialog: hurt us. it's like they think I'm
dialog: their princess or something.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT.-CRATER CAVES -EVENING-FLITURE
text: Judy is examining the palm of the largest beast as Maureen scrutinizes
text: the images graven into the giant stone.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Best as I can tell this whole clan
dialog: was spawned by this single creature.
dialog: (to the beast)
dialog: We've been a busy girl haven't we?
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Speak, doctor.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Each creature seems to have unique
text: corpuscular patterns on their palms.
dialog: As individual an fingerprints, no
dialog: two alike. Except...
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Except the prints on this giant
dialog: creature and our little Blip
dialog: match exactly. Don't they?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: How did you know?
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Because, I think Blip and our friend
dialog: here are actually one and the same.
text: Penny and Judy stare at her in wonder.
scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE
text: The Robot, shoving John with one claw, carrying Don in the other,
text: follows Older Will into the giant room.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: Father, I give you ... eternity.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: War torn and pirated. A pit of molten lava bursts through the floor
text: above which floats a giant ball of silvery liquid held suspended by
text: the pulsing field of the hyper-drive. Tendrils of fire strain towards
text: the bubble. As they EXPLODE into the silver liquid, images form within
text: the sphere, nearly coherent, then gone.
text: A tracked gantry stretches from the floor, leading out over the
text: bubble. At the end of the track a crow's-nest of COMPUTERS SHOOTS a
text: single laser down into the center of the bubble.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: (coming to)
dialog: . . .ouch. Who ordered me that last
dialog: drink? What the hell is going on?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I think we crossed into our own
dialog: future. We've come back to the
dialog: Jupiter Two decades after we left.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: Look father, what my flights of
dialog: fancy have wrought. I used your
dialog: hypergate to build my time machine.
text: Will moves to a control console at the base of the giant gantry.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: Over the years I have struggled in
dialog: vain to harness the awesome power of
dialog: time. All my experiments at creating
text: a stable doorway have been futile.
dialog: Until now. Today you will witness my
dialog: ultimate triumph.
text: Will hits a button. A generator opens, revealing a glowing cylinder of
text: core material incrementally descending into the console.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: The core material. if we could get
dialog: that back to our Jupiter Two...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: The doorways in time that led us
dialog: here must be a side effect of his
text: machine coming on line. Like streams
dialog: running into the ocean....
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: Once this core material in fully
text: introduced into the control console,
dialog: I will open a doorway stable enough
dialog: for one person to take one trip
text: through time and space as well.
dialog: Today, I will change history.
text: Will turns a switch on the control console. (OVER) More TREMORS. The

dialog: I'll stop us from taking off. I'll
dialog: do what you never could. I'll save

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Look around. Your machine is ripping this planet
dialog: apart. What if the force
dialog: wave you ride home has the same
dialog: effect on Earth? What if, in getting
dialog: home, you destroy Earth in the
dialog: process?
text: A beat. Then Will turns away, goes back to work.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: I'm going home. I'm going to save
dialog: the family.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Will, I'm your father. You've got to
dialog: listen to me-.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: Let me tell you about my father. My
dialog: father was a walking ghost. Never
dialog: there when I needed him. He dragged
text: his family into deep dark space and
dialog: lost them there. My father is not

text: Will and Smith are closing on the battered ship. Smith puts his hand
text: on the boy's arm, holding him back.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We've got to go inside.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Slow down, now. We can't know what
text: waits inside that ravaged craft. But
dialog: we can be confidant it is nothing
dialog: good. And I for one am frightened.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But Dad's in there.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Will, listen to me. I have crossed
dialog: this world with you, found your
dialog: father as promised. But I can't let
dialog: you go in there unarmed.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But I've got a gun.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: If we go forward, the barer of that
dialog: weapon must be ready to kill. Murder
dialog: is a skill, one which I have
dialog: developed and, luckily dear boy, you
dialog: have not. Look inside your heart,
dialog: Will. Are you truly capable of
dialog: taking a life? If not, then I ask
dialog: you now, put your faith in me. Give
dialog: me your trust. Give me that gun.
text: Will stares him. Pulls free the pistol. Thumbs the lock pad.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Enable gun for all users.
speaker_heading: GUN
dialog: Voiceprint confirmed.
text: Will hands Smith the gun.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Finally.
text: Smith grabs Will by the neck, pressing the barrel to his temple.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: A brief lesson in survival on this
dialog: world or any other. Never trust
dialog: anyone. Remember it into your old
dialog: age, should you have one.
dialog: (shoving him forward)
dialog: Now move!
scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE
text: John stands facing older Will. Don is in the b.g., edging towards the
text: control panel and the descending core material.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We can go back across the portals to
dialog: the past, to the functioning Jupiter
dialog: Two, where your mother and sisters
dialog: are still alive. We can use this
text: core material to escape together.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: And then what? All of us lost in
dialog: space. Don't you see? I can do what
dialog: you never could. I can save us all.
text: Don has edged his way to the descending core material.
speaker_heading: SMITH (OVER)
dialog: I'm afraid not.
text: Through the doorway comes young
text: Will, Smith walking behind him, hand
text: on his shoulder, gun to his head.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Never fear. Smith is here.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Will, I. . .
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Don't move, Professor Robinson or
dialog: this rather peculiar family reunion
dialog: will be tragically brief.
dialog: (off Don)
dialog: I'll ask you to step away from that
dialog: console, Major.
text: Don stares at him a beat. Then obliges, walking over to join John.
text: Smith approaches the Robot.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Well, well, some of us just don't
dialog: know when to stay dead.
text: Smith goes into his tunic and removes his modified control bolt.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: I borrowed this from the probe ship
dialog: in hopes of taking over the helm
dialog: once we were in flight. But I seem
dialog: to have found a better use instead.
text: Smith slaps the bolt on the Robot's CPU. The automaton's arms go up,
text: then fall limp. Docile.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Let's try this dance again. You are
dialog: the puppet. I am the puppeteer. Do
dialog: get it right this time.
text: Smith activates the bolt. The Robot powers up once again.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Robot, enable electric disrupters.
text: The Robot's claws begin to glow with electricity. Smith smiles.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Now that's a good gargantuan.
text: Smith walks to Older Will, puts the gun to his head.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: Say goodbye to your past. You're
dialog: future lies with me. I'm going home
dialog: in your place.
text: Smith starts to pull Older Will away when Will comes forward, staring
text: at the time machine, eyes wide with awe.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You did it. Just like I imagined.
dialog: Re-routed the hypercore. But the
dialog: natural power source, the delivery
dialog: system. I never thought of those.
text: Older Will's smile is bittersweet as he places his hand on his younger
text: self. Touches his hair.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: You will. The future is never what
dialog: it looks like when you're ten.
speaker_heading: SMITH
text: Heartwarming. Nauseatingly
text: sentimental but heartwarming.
text: Smith shoves the boy back to his father, turns to Older Will.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: We certainly could have aged better,
dialog: I must say Now, show me how your
text: little time machine works.
text: But Will just smiles.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: An odd moment for mirth, don't you
dialog: think? What are you grinning at?
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: Look around you, Doctor. At this
dialog: hostile world. Do you really think a
dialog: boy could have survived all alone?
text: SMITH-CLOSE. Puzzled. Unseen, the boulder behind him seems to be
text: moving, shifting. A VOICE comes, alien, yet terrifyingly familiar.
speaker_heading: VOICE (OVER)
dialog: Never fear, Smith is here.
text: The shape behind him unfolds, coming up now, long spindled arms and
text: legs, ten feet tall, a hybrid monster, half spider, half Smith.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Hello, Doctor, how nice to see me
dialog: again after all these years.
text: Smith stands petrified as the creature approaches him on spindled
text: legs, goes down on its second knee joints, coming eye to eye.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
text: The spider's sting had some
dialog: unexpected side effects.
text: Spider Smith flexes his three jointed arm.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: But my unique gifts gave me an
dialog: advantage in this quarrelsome world.
text: Spider Smith reaches out and caresses Will's cheek. Turns to John.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: After the women were savaged, I
dialog: became the father Will never had.
text: He grabs Smith's arms and begins to move him about like a marionette,
text: engaging in a bizarre dance with himself.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: (bending him)
dialog: But you, Doctor. Your crude ambition
text: fills me with self-loathing.
dialog: (twisting him)
dialog: You see I have looked within me and
dialog: what I see is you.
text: With that Spider Smith lifts Smith over his head and hurls him like
text: torpedo through a torn hole in the hull, towards the rocks beyond.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: I never liked me, anyway.
text: Spider Smith turns to face the Robot.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Kill them all.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: But my dear boy, once the doorway in
dialog: time stabilizes, this planet is
text: going to come apart at the seams.
text: Smith throws the back of one hand over his forehead in a parody of a
dialog: twenties starlet.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: I am willing to perish here on this
dialog: world for the sake of your most
dialog: noble mission. But your selfish
dialog: father will only try to stop you.
text: His head comes forward, neck elongating so he faces WILL.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Once your mission is complete, none
dialog: of this will have happened anyway.
dialog: So why not just dispose of them?
text: But Will's gaze is impassive. Spider Smith actually SIGHS.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Very well. Robot, take them inside
dialog: the ship and keep them there. If
text: they move, then kill them.
scene_heading: ECT.-CRATER CAVES-FUTURE
text: Maureen and Judy are examining the heiroglyph stone. The ground
text: shakes. Birds SCREAM. (OVER) RUMBLING.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: We've got to get to the ship. Penny?
text: She turns. The clearing is empty. No Blips. No Penny. Blip runs cut
text: before them, grabs Maureen's hand, trying to pull her forward.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Where is she, girl?
text: In Blip's hand, a mass of colored ribbons from Penny's wrists. Blip
text: waves them in the air, then races off. A beat. The women follow.
scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM-FUTURE
text: The pulse laser is increasing its intensity, the corridor of images in

speaker_heading: PAN DOWN
text: Spider Smith stands with Will, watching as the Robot shepherds the
text: crew towards the body of the ship.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Well, it would seem the time is upon
dialog: us. Off we go, William.
text: Spider Smith starts climbing the gantry, truly like a spider, up
text: towards the bridge and crows nest hanging over the bubble.
text: Will walks to the control console platform, the platform now beginning
text: to rise on the gantry, towards the bridge above.
text: JOHN-POV. Something hangs from below the climbing Spider Smith's back.
text: It's an egg pouch of the kind they saw on the probe ship log.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (shouting)
text: Will, it's a trick. Smith's carrying
dialog: an egg sack. If he's willing to stay
dialog: on this world and die, why is he
dialog: about to spawn? He's going through
dialog: the portal himself.
text: The Robot FIRES a charge between its claws.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Proceed to the ship or be destroyed.
text: ON THE RISING CONTROL PLATFORM.
scene_heading: OLDER WILL-CLOSE. Frowns.
text: Suddenly, Smith's head drops INTO FRAME. The creature is hanging
text: upside-down. He smiles.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Hurry, boy. Time waits for no man.
scene_heading: EXT.-GANTRY SYSTEM-WIDE SHOT
text: The platform bearing Will reaches the top of the gantry and begins

scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO-ENGINE ROOM CONTROL PLATFORM-FUTURE
text: Spider Smith drops into place beside Older Will as the control
text: platform comes to a stop on the crow's-nest.
text: The core cylinder continues sinking into the console. Smith looks out
text: over the platform. Beneath them, imagine of infinity flicker.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: It's almost time. I really am a
dialog: word-smith.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: Once the core cylinder is fully
dialog: injected, the planet will begin to
dialog: come apart and the time doorway will
text: stabilize. Then I jump in.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: A leap of faith. How fitting.
text: TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. In the circle made by the laser, the images are not
text: yet stable, but discernable. Earth the day before the launch.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: Tell me again, old monster, how did
dialog: the girls die?
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: We've been over this before, son.
dialog: The spiders attacked the ship
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: In all the years since, the spiders
dialog: have never re-surfaced. Why?
text: Smith stares at him. Then he smiles. A horrible sight.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Let's forget the past.
text: Will turns a switch. The laser generated aperture narrows.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: Focusing the aperture. Remember, the
text: energy around the portal will rip a
dialog: man to pieces.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Isn't the doorway too small?
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: Not for me.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: But then I'm not going, am I? The
dialog: spiders didn't kill the girls. It
dialog: was you. I just never let myself see
dialog: it. You kept me alive because you
dialog: needed me. Because I could build
dialog: this for you. You killed my family.
dialog: Destroyed this world. And I helped.
dialog: You became mad as the spiders.
dialog: ...And I became you.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Poor, poor boy. Did you really think
dialog: I would let you go home? Let all
dialog: that I have become vanish? Look at
dialog: me. I am no mere man. I am a God.
text: Spider Smith opens his pouch, revealing a thousand tiny spiders.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Your father was right. Within me
dialog: roil the growing needs of a master
dialog: race. We WILL descend upon helpless
text: Earth. An entire planet to rule.
text: His arm whips out, grabbing Will, bringing him close, opens his mouth,
text: bearing venomous fangs.
speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
text: An entire planet on which to feed.
scene_heading: INT.-MODIFIED JUPITER TWO-FUTURE
text: John and Don talk in the holding area. The Robot stands guard. (OVER)

speaker_heading: ROBOT (OVER)
dialog: Halt or Robot will destroy.
text: The men look up. In the b.g., Will has approached the Robot.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you remember what I taught you. A
dialog: long time ago. About friendship?
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Friendship means acting with your
dialog: heart not your head.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That's why I rebuilt you. Because I
dialog: wanted us to be friends.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Logic error. Friendship does not
dialog: compute.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Forget logic. Act with your heart.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Robot has no heart. Robot is powered
dialog: by a fusion pulse generator
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Every living thing has a heart.
text: The Robot stares at him a beat.
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Any attempts to override command
dialog: protocols may result in fused
dialog: processors in my neural net.
text: The floor trembles again. The planet is coming apart at the seams.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Please, Robot, if you don't let us
dialog: go, we're all going to die. I'm
dialog: asking you now, will you help us?

text: At the last minute, the Robot jerks his hand upward, BLOWING away a

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: JOHN

text: John bites back a bittersweet smile. (OVER) another RUMBLING.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I could use a weapon.

speaker_heading: SPIDER SMITH
dialog: Goodbye.
text: Smith hurls Will over the rail towards the time pool below.

text: JOHN-CLOSE. A man who has lost everything he ever loved.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I couldn't save them.
text: Will stares at his father and beyond him. There, in the time doorway,
text: a young Will walks towards the entrance to Mission Control in the
text: morning sun, innocent with no knowledge of the future.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL (OVER)
dialog: So many years ago and I can still
dialog: feel it. Our sun. Our Earth. It's
dialog: all I've thought about. Going home.
text: Will reaches forward and touches the control console. The images in
text: the laser generated doorway begin to change.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: A long time ago, you told a small
dialog: boy that one day he'd understand how
dialog: precious he was, how much his father
dialog: loved him. Today is that day.
text: TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. Instead of Earth we now see this planet's surface,
text: the Jupiter Two rising as it did just moments ago.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: All I could see was your need to go
dialog: forward at any cost. What you never
dialog: showed me was your love. I lost
dialog: that. Robbed by time. I could never
dialog: see how much you cared. Until now.
text: TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The Jupiter Two tries in vain to dodge the fire

speaker_heading: MAUREEN

dialog: Goodbye my love.
speaker_heading: PENNY

text: The bridge of the Jupiter Two is visible in the laser generated
text: doorway. Older WILL looks to his father.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL

scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO
text: The ceiling becomes water an John drops into the ship. Maureen cradles
text: her husband. Then she looks up. Will is still visible through the

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Come with us.
text: But the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the
text: world of the engine room EXPLODES in the b.g.
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL

dialog: for one person, one trip, remember?
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Will?
speaker_heading: OLDER WILL
dialog: It's good to see you again, Mom.
dialog: It's good to see you alive.
dialog: (fading)
dialog: Sorry about all the monkey business.
text: Maureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands
text: almost touching before Will is gone, the portal closed forever.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: He sacrificed everything for his
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: (fighting tears)
dialog: He had a good example.
text: Maureen holds him close. A small figure walks up beside them. Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Dad?
text: A beat, then Will reaches up, hands him his dog tags.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm glad you came back.
speaker_heading: JOHN

scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: I'm going to try to reach escape
dialog: velocity. Maybe we can break the
dialog: gravitational pull.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No. We don't have the core material.
dialog: The gravity wells will drag us down.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: We might-
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We won't make it. Trust me. I know.
dialog: We've got to go down.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: That's insane.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don't have time to argue. I'm
dialog: giving you a direct order, Major.
text: Don and John stare at each other a beat. Then Don smiles.
speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: Yes Sir.

scene_heading: INT.-JUPITER TWO
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: WEST
dialog: So, I earn that kiss yet?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: (a peck on the cheek)
dialog: You earned that.

speaker_heading: MAUREEN
