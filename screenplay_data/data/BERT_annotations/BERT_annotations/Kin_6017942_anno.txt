dialog: You don't get to choose family.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You don’t. And just cause someone's
dialog: family, it doesn’t mean they can’t

scene_heading: EXT. DETROIT CITYSCAPE - DAY
text: ANGLE: straight down and moving. An infinite patchwork of
text: blasted cityscape in cubes and rectangles.
speaker_heading: YOUNG VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: All you can do when it comes to the
dialog: people you love is brace yourself.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's just how it is.
text: The tops of buildings from way far up. Rolling out before us
text: like a gargantuan concrete blanket spattered in greenery.
scene_heading: INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - UNSPEC - DAY
dialog: 
text: ANGLE: we come in on a set of youthful shoulders. A KID,
text: seated, facing away from us. Beyond, behind a desk, is an
text: AGING WOMAN, dressed in conservative attire.
text: This boy is ELI (12), black, handsome. Quiet.
speaker_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: How would you say the year has
dialog: been, overall?
text: Still facing away from us, Eli shrugs.
speaker_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: Good? Bad?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Normal. I think.
speaker_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: Normal for you, or for a regular
dialog: school year?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: For a school year.
speaker_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: How was your year?
text: Eli is quiet for a moment. Doesn’t answer that question. And
text: as he holds this silence -- we BEGIN TO TRACK around him --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Fine.
text: The Guidance Counselor doesn’t push any harder on this.
speaker_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: And things at home? How’s your dad?
dialog: How’s he doing?
text: Another shrug.
speaker_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: What about plans for the summer,
dialog: any vacations in the works?
text: Eli shakes his head. And now we’ve gotten our first good look
dialog: at him. Handsome for sure. Wise-beyond-his-years...
text: ... the Guidance Counselor takes in his face and smiles,
text: pleasant. But there’s something preoccupied lingering.
speaker_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: It’s okay to talk to me, Elijah.
dialog: (beat)
text: It is. Sitting across from me I see a
dialog: young man who’s creative, and smart --
dialog: (then)
dialog: -- but who doesn’t want to be seen.
text: The Guidance Counselor waits another beat for Eli to take
text: this in. When he stays quiet, she lets him go --
speaker_heading: GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
dialog: Be good out there. We’ll see you in
dialog: September.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Okay.
text: And over this -- we HEAR THE SOUND OF A SCHOOL BELL -- the
text: FERVOR of EXCITED STUDENT VOICES transitioning us into --
scene_heading: EXT. ST. FLORIAN’S - PARKING LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: ON ELI as he moves. Apart from his CLASSMATES, celebrating
dialog: and WHOOPING as the school year ends --
text: SOME race for BASKETBALL COURTS, GIRLS Eli’s age flutter in
text: and out of GOSSIPY CIRCLES, OTHER KIDS opt for TRICKS on
text: SKATEBOARDS -- CUTTING past Eli -- who moves on his own.
text: Wading through all this. We see it clear as day. Eli doesn’t
text: gel with his peers. He’s not one of them. Setting out instead
text: for the neighborhoods beyond. Determined.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAY
text: A rusty garage door is YANKED open. Eli, with a backpack over
text: his shoulder, enters and crosses for --
text: -- a weathered BMX bike.
scene_heading: EXT. HAMTRAMCK - CITY STREETS - DAY
dialog: 
text: PEDALING. Sunshine. Wanderlust. Spokes WHIP past, as does a --
text: -- hodge-podge of low-rent signage in this heart of DETROIT's
dialog: former industrial corridor. Polish, Bangladeshi, Arabic and
text: more. Eli WEAVES westward up Caniff -- skids to a STOP at --
scene_heading: EXT. PRELLA METALWORKS - SCRAPYARD - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: HASAN, a tattooed Arabic teen with a cigarette lit, sees Eli
text: coming, sweeping out front --
speaker_heading: HASAN
dialog: You got another haul for us or what?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Almost there. What’s copper at?
speaker_heading: HASAN
text: Copper and aluminum radiators.
dialog: Seventy cents a pound this week.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (re: up the street)
dialog: L & J says they’1l do 80.
text: Hasan looks at Eli. Beat. Then drags and smiles.
speaker_heading: HASAN
dialog: That's what they said?
dialog: (Eli nods)
dialog: I'll talk to my uncle. Bring what
dialog: you got here first, okay?
dialog: (in Arabic)
dialog: Little thief.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHLAND PARK - DETROIT - DAY
text: Eli makes his way across the 1-75 OVERPASS now. Into wide
text: swaths of DERELICT CITY which follow. Open expanses of VACANT
text: LOTS, ABANDONED HOMES and FACTORIES. Remnants of a different
text: era. Epic. Dystopic. Eli a SPECK in this wild.
scene_heading: EXT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - DAY
text: Interconnected shells of buildings TOWER past barb-wire gates.
text: Abandoned. Busted glass, scorched pavement and litter.
text: Eli SWOOPS PAST into view, stashes his bike near an overpass,
text: peels back a section of perimeter fencing --
scene_heading: INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY
dialog: 
text: Almost cathedral-like. Eli enters. Ahead, a wide section of
text: the roof has collapsed under decades of heavy snow.
text: Vines and greenery swallow fossilized machinery guts now in
text: the hot and humid months. Dancing across ruin.
scene_heading: INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - SECOND BUILDING - DAY
dialog: 
text: ECHOES. Eli uses a CROWBAR from his bag to CHIP away at
text: walls. He slows -- peers into the hole he’s just burrowed.
text: He knew it. Begins TUGGING out dirty COPPER WIRE. Begins
text: excavating ALUMINUM PIPING next. Piece by piece. An expert.
text: ANGLES: stuffing his backpack. Searching. Hacking. REPEATING
scene_heading: the process. AGAIN. AGAIN. AGAIN. His haul growing...
scene_heading: INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - THIRD BUILDING - DAY
dialog: 
text: SHIMMYING beneath a half-collapsed door. Further inside now.
text: Eli sets his nearly-full backpack down for a beat --
text: -- and reaches into his pocket to grab an INHALER. A PUFFER
dialog: we recognize as the type carried for asthma. Eli uses it.
text: Takes a deep BREATH reaches for his CROWBAR --
text: Then stops. Beat. His breath is visible. It's cold in here.
text: Eli turns. Spots a DARKENED CORRIDOR ahead. A small frozen
text: wind brushes past. Eli removes a MAGLIGHT from his backpack.
scene_heading: INT. DARKENED CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: MOVING through total blackness. Eli clicks on the flashlight
text: as -- KKAA-RRUUNG. A NOISE faraway -- dust shakes loose above.
text: -- Eli LOOKS. Listens a beat. Nothing follows.
text: His breath FOGGING the air thicker. It’s summer outside. It
dialog: should be an oven in here.
text: Eli shines his light -- crystalline formations of ice are
text: visible along the floor at his feet and along walls. He moves
text: around a final bend, frost crunching underfoot, into --
scene_heading: INT. MASSIVE FROZEN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: A MASSIVE DERELICT CHAMBER. Enters. Cautious --
text: Eli sees something that takes him -- and us -- a moment to
dialog: process. This cavernous space like all the others except:
text: Whispers of light snow levitate past --
text: Adding an ethereal aura to what looks like DAMAGE done by
text: some kind of WEAPONS FIRE. Slits of natural light cut through
scene_heading: BLAST HOLES EVERYWHERE.
text: Not done by bullets. Something else.
text: Eli, heart beginning to thunder -- steps forward. And sees --
text: BODIES. A half-odd dozen of them or more --
text: All in ADVANCED, MENACING, OTHERWORLDLY ARMOR -- lying strewn
text: about the space in varying configurations of carnage.
text: Eli has somehow wandered into the aftermath of an O.K. Corral
dialog: scenario. Only we can’t be sure the players are from Earth.
scene_heading: HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.
text: This was an ugly fight too. Eli turns. Half expecting sirens
dialog: or some adult to burst into the room and take charge...
text: Only silence and frozen wind call back. Eli hesitates. Wades
dialog: even closer...
text: ..-- from the look of these ARMORED BODIES, there were TWO
text: DISTINCT SIDES. ONE has sleeker-looking ARMOR, the SECOND is
text: rough-etched. Utilitarian beneath bits of battered garb.
text: Both sides WEAR MECHANIZED HELMETS. Concealing their features.
text: Eli sloooowly approaches the closest MOTIONLESS BODY, splayed
text: out across a pile of RUBBLE -- he stares at the helmet and
text: carefully wipes away a thin layer of frost from the visor --
text: -- and slows. At Eli’s feet: IS SOME KIND OF METALLIC DEVICE.
text: One of theirs. Its contours sleek and other-worldly. Eli
text: leans down... grips it. Cautious. Lifts it to INSPECT --
text: -- and the gesture ACTIVATES something. The device CHIMES.
text: Some kind of PROMPT, as though it’s POWERING UP. As it does --
text: -- the device OPENS. Or rather, the OUTER LAYER DOES. A self-
text: retracting SHIELD. Revealing the CONTOURS of what’s clearly a
scene_heading: SHOTGUN-SIZED ALIEN WEAPON beneath --
text: -- then the MOTIONLESS BODY he was just examining MOVES. Its
text: helmet turns, looks right at Eli --
text: -- and the ARMORED FIGURE THRUSTS A DYING HAND TOWARDS ELI.
text: Eli RECOILS. SLIPS on ice. FALLS. DROPS everything --
text: MAGLIGHT gone. THE WEAPON-SHAPED DEVICE TOO. It goes SLIDING
text: away from Eli and -- DOWN INTO an open ELEVATOR SHAFT --
scene_heading: INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - THIRD BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Eli SCRAMBLES. Slip-sliding. FUMBLES for his BACKPACK.
scene_heading: EXT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - DARKENED CORRIDOR - DAY
dialog: 
text: PIECES of piping clang and roll down the street as Eli PEDALS
text: away. Backpack not zipped up. RACING like FUCKING HELL --
text: PANTING. HYPERVENTILATING. PANIC. EYES WIDE -- only once he's
text: cleared a good few blocks does Eli skid to a stop --
text: GASPING. Sheer. Utter. Absolute. Disbelief. He reaches once
text: more for his INHALER, and as he does, USES it -- BREATHES --
text: Staring back at the ABANDONED COMPLEX -- we CUT TO:
speaker_heading: B AG M A N
scene_heading: EXT. HAMTRAMCK - CITY STREETS - LATE DAY
dialog: 
text: Eli pedals, ghostly pale, scanning every passing face. Folks
text: concerned with daily commutes, deliveries -- the mundane...
scene_heading: EXT. HROBSKY HOME - DAY
text: Eli ushers his BMX up the drive of a tiny, sturdy home. Built
text: originally for auto-workers in the 1920s. Stashes his bike.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF THE GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: And moves for the back of the garage to an overturned WHEEL-
text: BARROW. Lifts it to reveal a BOX FILLED with SCRAP metal. Eli
text: deposits what’s left in his backpack and --
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - LIVING ROOM - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Eli. Quiet. Motionless. Mind still churning. Replaying events
text: in his head atop a sofa in this working man's living room.
text: HEADLIGHTS of an early nineties PICKUP TRUCK pull into the
text: driveway outside. Booted FOOTSTEPS approach --
text: HAROLD HROBSKY, or HAL (late 50s), white, enters. A battered
text: old Polack. Face and hands like granite. Hard lines. Wearing
text: a well-used Red Wings jacket.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Finish your homework?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Summer break started.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (recollects, looks around)
dialog: And now you've, what? Forgotten how
dialog: to read?
text: Hal points to a NOTE. Hand-scrawled in bossy all-caps: DO
dialog: YOUR CHORES!
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Get your shoes on, I need help with
dialog: something.
scene_heading: EXT. HROBSKY HOME - DRIVEWAY/GARAGE - DUSK
text: Eli straining, helping Hal move a shitload of cut lumber from
text: his truck to the garage in the dark. This sucks.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: -- that rush gig in Corktown. They
dialog: change their minds every day last
dialog: minute, had to -- pick all this up
dialog: for tomorrow --
text: They set down the last piece. Eli realizes --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: We gotta load all this back in?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: At six thirty a.m. That is correct.
dialog: (off Eli’s look)
dialog: Somebody’'11 steal it.
text: Hal passes en route for the garage. Eli silently protesting --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Who’s gonna steal a buncha wood?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (sends him a look)
dialog: You seen my maglight?
dialog: That would be the flashlight Eli abandoned earlier. Oops.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Not lately...
text: Hal CURSES in Polish, scans the place one more time in vein
text: and crosses back to the truck for invoice slips.
text: Sits on the lift-gate. Squints and scribbles. Eli quiet.
text: Clearly annoyed and looking to slip back inside --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: What’s with you today? Huh? You
dialog: forget your chores, I can see you
dialog: giving me lip --
text: Hal looks at Eli. Regards him. Motions him over.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You know if I’m hard on you, it's
dialog: cause the world’s hard. I’ve seen
dialog: that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And a good man? Accounts for himself.
dialog: He shoulders responsibility, even
dialog: when he doesn’t want to.
text: Eli nods, but it’s to get Hal off his back. Hal holds on that
text: a moment. Shifts. Preoccupied with something unsaid...
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: We need a third place for dinner.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your brother's on his way.
text: Hal HOLDS on Eli. Says this next part with significance.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Be careful around him.
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - VARIOUS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sizzling frying pans and simmering pots fog the air as Hal
text: COOKS. Eli removes a new plate and utensils from a cupboard --
text: The DOORBELL RINGS. Eli turns to Hal, who nods. Get it. Eli
text: goes. Opens the front door to get our first look at --
text: JIMMY HROBSKY (20s), white, handsome with a dash of scumbag.
text: Stands on the stoop, lean, tattooed and cool with a bag slung
text: over his shoulder.
text: Jimmy bears a familial resemblance to Hal -- genetic only.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Eli.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Man. Six years didn’t seem like
dialog: such a long time until just now --
text: Jimmy brushes past. Rustles Eli’s hair as he goes -- Eli
text: wincing. Jimmy enters the living room, looks around as though
text: sizing it up, and slows. Then.
text: Jimmy sees, crosses toward Hal in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Pops.
text: Hal looks up, eyes his son standing in the doorway. Wary --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: This is just for a week or two.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I know.
text: An unspoken sentiment hangs thick between these two. Hal
text: cautiously nods.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Eli can set you up in the office.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Office?
speaker_heading: HAL
text: Upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: ANGLE: a completely empty bedroom with a desk in it. Barren.
text: Jimmy shakes his head. Tosses his bag onto a dusty futon and
text: turns to Eli. Looks him over.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So. What's your deal these days?
text: Eli shrugs. Beat. Jimmy does the gesture right back.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That? That’s your deal? You
dialog: remember me at all?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How old were you when I left?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Which time?
text: Jimmy snickers. Looks Eli over and grins. A mischievous glint
text: flashing. Jimmy then pushes past Eli into --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Let’s see what you did, huh? To my
dialog: digs.
text: ELI'S ROOM. Enters without permission. Jimmy scans walls of
text: space charts, original artwork and drawings, sketches of
dialog: other planets and maps... huh...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Wow, okay...
text: .-». he turns to Eli’s CLOSET. Eli watches, cautious, as Jimmy
text: spots a set of NOTCHES. HEIGHT MARKS with corresponding DATES
text: scribbled to measure the growth of a child. Written atop is:
speaker_heading: ELI.
text: Jimmy turns to a second set of NOTCHES on the opposite frame.
dialog: 11.
text: JIMMY. He regards them a moment, looks down -- then --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What the hell are those?
text: He’s pointing at Eli's sneakers on the floor.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: My shoes.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You wear those in public?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I’m saving up for new ones.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: With what? Dad’s five-dollar-a-week-
dialog: allowance?
text: Jimmy slows. Notes the way Eli stays quiet --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh. You got a side thing going.
dialog: Little lemonade stand?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Good for you. I can respect that.
text: Jimmy throws an honor-among-thieves smile at Eli.
text: Eli nods.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Tell you what. I got some Chucks
text: somewhere around here in a trunk.
dialog: You can have em. They’re almost new.
dialog: Won't stink as much as those do.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Sound good?
dialog: There’s an outlaw charm to Jimmy.
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jimmy, cleaned up -- takes in the space of the living room.
text: Catholic and Polish decor. Sayings in the latter.
text: Jimmy turns, eyes a full roster of RED WINGS BOBBLE HEADS on
text: a dusty shelf. Narrows in on an YZERMAN and BOB PROBERT.
text: Hal crosses out of the kitchen nearby. Bringing SERVING
text: DISHES to the table. Corn, baked potatoes and Golabki --
dialog: Hal looks
dialog: Hal turns
dialog: the shelf
speaker_heading: a YOUNGER
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (points)
dialog: Still got the bobble-heads, huh?
text: up, regards the shelf a moment...
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Your mother liked em. So.
text: back into the kitchen. Leaving Jimmy to consider
text: a moment longer. Just past them -- is a PICTURE of
text: HAL with his arms around JIMMY’S MOTHER.
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Eating in silence. Routine for Hal and Eli, but -- Jimmy sips
text: from his bowl -- slows -- revels in the moment.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Golabki. You guys got no idea, man.
dialog: None. Don't even get me started.
dialog: (to Eli)
dialog: Think you could ever miss the taste
dialog: of a baked potato? And I mean. Not
dialog: special. Just made right, like this,
dialog: with a little butter.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You get locked away you got no idea
dialog: the kinda shit you’1ll miss. If
dialog: somebody gave me a blue light right
dialog: now and some ice cream, there'd be a
dialog: high probability of me breaking into
dialog: tears like a little bit-
text: Jimmy sees Hal’s expression and stops just shy. Eli grins.
dialog: Hal nods,
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Glad you like.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I do. So, uh. How's business?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Fine.
text: sips. Jimmy waits for him to elaborate.
text: Doesn't happen. So Jimmy nods. Chews.
text: Looks to Eli. Who’s watching both of them, eating. Beat.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You talk too much. Anyone ever tell
dialog: you that? Huh?
text: Eli grins again. Hal watches the way Eli sparks to that --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: -- those are new. On your hands.
text: Hal motions. Stern. To a pair of Jimmy’s small prison tats.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah? Like em?
dialog: (taps each)
dialog: This one wards off evil spirits,
dialog: and this one wards off Mexicans.
text: Eli abruptly SNORTS into his stew.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You think that’s funny?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Eli does.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: He’s twelve.
text: Hal turns his gaze on Eli. Face buried in his meal.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sorry. It’s not. Look --
dialog: (exhales )
dialog: I'm happy to be home, okay? I just
dialog: wanna talk and laugh and catch up
dialog: like a family. I don’t mean anyt-
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: This isn't a reunion.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I know --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You were just released. You’re here
dialog: cause you gotta sort your life out.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And I’m gonna --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: So you wanna talk, let's talk about
dialog: that. What’re your next steps?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'll get a job.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Where? What kinda job?
text: Jimmy wavers. On the spot. Eli looks from Hal to Jimmy, then
dialog: back to Hal...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: To be honest? I was thinking that,
dialog: with coming back, putting in some
dialog: time for --
dialog: (here goes)
dialog: Us to bond, show you I'm straight --
dialog: Maybe you could put in a good word
dialog: at whatever site you're working.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I can’t do that.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Cause I can't clear an ex-con. It
dialog: doesn’t work like that.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: But I'm your son -- I mean, you
dialog: just tell em --
text: Hal sends a look at Jimmy. This isn’t gonna be discussed.
text: Jimmy wavers. Hal stares right back. Beat. So Jimmy grabs his
text: fork. Fishing through his meal. STABBING carrots --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Great. So. Six years gone, no word,
dialog: no visit --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I visited.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Once. To let me know ma passed. Six
dialog: years! I come home, no complaints,
dialog: ask for one favor and it turns out
dialog: you'd rather see me flipping
dialog: burgers --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: It’s a start.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Flipping burgers?!
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Anything's better than being a
dialog: thief. A low life.
text: Jimmy halts. That stung. Looks at Hal, staring back.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I think I'm gonna step out. Got a
dialog: few people to see.
text: Jimmy slides his chair back LOUD, brings his plate to the
text: sink. Grabs his coat, a spare key, and he's gone. Eli, head
text: still low, waits a moment... looks to Hal...
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (growls)
dialog: Chores. Then bed.
scene_heading: EXT. TATTERED HOUSE - WESTLAND - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: WESTLAND. Just shy of Canton. Called wasteland by locals for
text: a reason. A downriver sprawl transformed by River Rouge plant
text: runoff into a hick meth paradise. A CAB pulls past us --
text: Jimmy gets out -- crosses the street. A group of TEENAGERS
text: across the street is going at it -- a BRAWL on a LAWN --
text: Two dead-eyed CONS lean off a stoop ahead. Tattoos depicting
text: valknots and the numbers 14 and 88. The SCARIER one eyes
dialog: Jimmy’s approach --
speaker_heading: SCARY
dialog: What you looking for, man?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Just finished a bid out in Jackson.
dialog: Uh. Taylor's expecting me to come
dialog: through... he here?
scene_heading: INT. TATTERED HOUSE - WESTLAND - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A SHIT HOLE topped off with a brand new PS4 and FLAT-SCREEN.
text: Cigarette-burned furniture everywhere. JUNKIES loiter like
text: zombies. Filthy. Swimming in drug paraphernalia. Cheery MUSIC
text: plays loudly.
text: Jimmy's led by a YOUNG GRUBBY WOMAN. Either sleep-deprived or
text: high -- through a gross KITCHEN, passing YOUNG TEENS counting
text: CASH out on a folding table. To a STAIRWELL --
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. TATTERED HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jimmy, doing his best calm walk, descends into an unfinished
text: cement dungeon. Oddly packed with SHIPPING CRATES and --
text: -- prying each one open with a crowbar is TAYLOR BOLEK (30s).
text: a grimy Aryan con with a leaning gate and cleft lip.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Hrobsky! Welcome home, man -- you
dialog: remember my brother Dutch?
text: Jimmy nods to DUTCH (30s), seated atop a crate nearby -- the
text: bigger, Cro-Magnon version of Taylor. Staring murder.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah. How’s it goin, I uh --
text: Jimmy's spotted this basement's THIRD OCCUPANT. A SHIRTLESS
text: GUY, beat to shit -- FACING the corner, bleeding from his
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Oh that’s Renny. Don't worry about
text: him, he's in time-out.
text: The guy wobbles. The recipient of a very recent beating --
speaker_heading: RENNY
dialog: Tay man, come on --
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Hey! What'd I tell you??
speaker_heading: RENNY
dialog: -- my ear's bleeding, man...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: PUT YOUR NOSE back in that corner
dialog: right fuckin now, you hear me??
dialog: Contemplate your shitty attitude.
text: Jimmy watches this exchange -- looks again to DUTCH -- who’s
text: GLARING at Jimmy. Taylor turns back to the shipping crate --
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: So Jimmy. You wanna toast a spliff
dialog: or get right to it?
text: Taylor RIPS the top of the crate off -- pulls a MACHINE GUN
text: out into open view. This crate is FULL of them. Isreali-made.
text: Jimmy chokes out a tense smile --
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Not quite time to toast yet for me -
dialog: - I know, I uh. I owe you guys
dialog: money, which -- I'm taking real
dialog: serious...
text: The temperature of the room seems to drop a few degrees.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: So you don’t got the sixty?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No, but -- I want you to see, I’m
dialog: not dodging you guys --
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Man. That's a real bummer.
text: Taylor begins loading machine guns into smaller boxes labeled
text: SALSA -- where Dutch looks ready to take Jimmy’s head off.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: See, Jimmy -- me and my brother --
dialog: (lots and lots of guns)
dialog: We don’t, ah. Project illusions
dialog: about who we are and what we do,
dialog: you know? We made it clear from day
dialog: one, post charges or what have you,
dialog: how we operate on loans, cause
dialog: there are guys who do business like
dialog: you, and guys who do business like
dialog: us --
dialog: (turns )
dialog: Jail can be a nasty place. You

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: There some funny language about

text: CLICK-CLACK. The MACHINE GUN in Taylor's hands is loaded now.
text: He takes a step in toward Jimmy --
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: TAYLOR

speaker_heading: TAYLOR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: -- Taylor. Man.

text: LIGHTS, unearthly, glow in abstract -- HUMMING. Brighter.

scene_heading: INT. ELI'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: ANGLE: Eli wakes up. Lying in bed. The HUMMING still ringing
text: lightly in his ears...
text: After a moment -- he sits up, unable to shake the dream...
scene_heading: EXT. DETROIT - CITY STREETS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Eli PEDALS. A DUFFLE BAG slung over his shoulders. ADRENALINE
text: spiking. A kid who shouldn’t be out in a neighborhood this
dialog: tough this late. Scary --
text: A TRIO of HOODS CALL OUT from a GAS STATION as he passes,
text: faces lit only by the cherries of dragged cigarettes --
speaker_heading: HOODS, ETC
dialog: Yo -- 1il man! Hey! Come here real
dialog: quick -- Yo!
scene_heading: EXT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Eli skids to a stop. No one’s visible in sight. Street lights
text: don't work out here. VACANT STRUCTURES linger now like creaky
text: monsters dozing in hunkered down silence. Haunting.
text: The MASSIVE ABANDONED COMPLEX is right where we left it.
dialog: 19.
scene_heading: INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: Eli enters. Moving through the MASSIVE SPACE. Every step an ECHO
text: in the black. Eli wades further --
scene_heading: INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - O.K. CORRAL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: ANGLE: HAL'S MAGLIGHT. Right where it was dropped. Eli picks
text: it up. CLICKS it on and TURNS, SCANS the open air and --
dialog: The aftermath of what we witnessed earlier is 100% GONE.
text: No ice formations. No strange, FALLEN ARMORED ALIEN SOLDIERS.
text: Like no one was ever here. Eli WHIRLS. Aims his flashlight at
text: the walls, the ceiling, the floor -- SCORCH MARKS and HOLES
dialog: left by the WEAPONS’ FIRE remain, but if we're being honest --
dialog: A naysayer could call those anything.
text: Eli turns to THE OPEN ELEVATOR SHAFT. Where THE WEAPON went
text: SLIDING... he crosses -- leans over the edge --
text: Three stories straight down into shadow. Eli wavers... GRIPS
text: his DUFFLE. CLIMBS down and in. SCALING.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Eli DROPS to a safe landing, into decades of dust and debris.
text: Pitch black. Eli fumbles. CLICKS on the MAGLIGHT. Lighting up
dialog: the bottom of this space around him --
text: SEES THE WEAPON DEVICE. Still down here. Lying in the dirt.
text: Eli reaches for it -- but before he can touch it, LIGHTS
text: illuminate across the DEVICE. Eli recoils, startled for a
text: second, then -- slowly -- he reaches... picks it up.
text: Once again, it CHIMES. As though this thing has recognized
text: him -- THE WEAPON COMES TO LIFE.
text: Lighting up the darkness down here with an OTHERWORLDLY GLOW.
text: THE OUTER SHIELD OPENS.
text: RECONFIGURING. PIECES of its EXTERIOR RETRACT AND FOLD BACK
text: on their own to REVEAL a TRIGGER, BARREL -- a 3D TARGETTING
text: system flickers into view, glowing, summoned out of thin air.
text: Impossibly cool. The weapon HUMMING. Talking to him. Eli

dialog: 20.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - MOVING - NIGHT
text: ANGLE: that DUFFLE BAG NOW FULL. Slung over Eli's shoulders

scene_heading: EXT. HROBSKY HOME - UP THE BLOCK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Eli comes RACING up the street. SWERVES for cover behind
text: bushes as -- a CAB pulls up to Hal's house ahead --
text: Jimmy. Eli watches Jimmy get out, his footsteps a tipsy
text: march. Climbing the front stairs of the house...
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - NIGHT
text: Jimmy enters. Sees HAL. Still up watching Red Wings
dialog: highlights. Beat.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Where'd you go?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Ended up at the Polish Sea League,
dialog: um. Knew the bartender from ham
dialog: high, she --
dialog: (drunk, smiles)
dialog: Bought me some celebratory shots.
text: Another beat. Jimmy's fumbling a little with the sleeves of
text: his coat. Hal, watches this -- and --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You need anything?
text: Jimmy slows. Hal’s looked up from the TV at him. Jimmy’s
text: unprepared for the civility. Cautious.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Erm. Water? Tylenol?
scene_heading: EXT. HROBSKY HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: THE FOLLOWING IS ALL ONE SHOT: Eli silently walks his bike up
text: the driveway, DUCKS as Hal crosses past in the window above --
text: -- holds. Eli stashes the bike and crosses, climbs a nearby
text: garden stoop. Up along the back of the house. Up. Up. Up. Eli
text: reaches, grips the gutter above --
text: AND FREEZES. As Hal re-emerges in view. Slows to a STOP in
text: the window above the sink. Goes. Once he’s gone, Eli looks --
dialog: 21.
text: Scales the rest of the way up to his bedroom window --
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Hal returns to Jimmy with the glass of water, offers it along
text: with two tablets of store brand ibuprofen. Jimmy accepts...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Gonna need, uh --
text: He fumbles. Smiles again. Stuffs the pills into his pocket.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: -- these bad boys in the morning.
text: And Hal watches his own son. Drunk. Making hangover jokes...
text: something stirs deep down. Just trying to put it right.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Jimmy. I wanna help you, okay? I
dialog: do. But you got a decade’s worth of
dialog: bad decisions under your belt, and
dialog: you gotta make up for that first.
dialog: You gotta be ready to work jobs you
dialog: don’t like, earn experience, earn
dialog: trust --
text: Jimmy nods. Bleary. Pounding the glass of water. Hal eyes
dialog: this -- maybe now’s not the time.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: But, uh. Let’s talk in the morning.
text: Hal nods, moves for the stairs. And as he goes --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No. We should talk now.
text: Hal slows. Something was different in Jimmy's voice right
text: there -- he turns back...
scene_heading: INT. ELI'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Eli slides the DUFFLE BAG with THE WEAPON under his bed --
text: rises. Hearing VOICES in the living room below...
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Jimmy thumbs that empty water glass a moment -- shaky... and
text: he looks back at Hal. For the first time in a while. Jimmy’s
text: eyes are glassy. With more than booze.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sixty K. I need to borrow sixty K.
dialog: Sorry but it’s gotta be you.
text: Jimmy's eyes are glassy with fear. Hal’s unsure how to react.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: From me? Are you kidding? Jimmy I
dialog: don’t have that kind of --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It’s a whole thing. It's the reason
dialog: I'm alive right now. You gotta hear
dialog: me out —-
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: -- no. I don't.
text: Hal’s interrupted Jimmy. He holds on his son.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Not in my own home. Whatever this
dialog: is, I’m not interested. Not anymore.
text: Hal turns again. Moves determined up the stairs now --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What about the safe?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The one you keep at work sites.
dialog: -- and Hal STOPS.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: One time, cash goes missing. I'll
dialog: never ask you for a thing again, I
dialog: can even pay it back over time --
text: Hal MOVES decisively back down the stairs --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: What exactly are you saying to me?
dialog: You want me to do what, exactly?
dialog: (approaching)
dialog: Steal for you? Let you steal?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It’s not for me, that’s what I’m-
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Who's it for then? Huh? Let’s hear.
dialog: Go ahead --
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Dangerous people. Okay? For when I
dialog: was inside.
dialog: (imploring)
dialog: The kind you don't not pay back.
dialog: People who won't just stop with me,
dialog: you -- you --
dialog: (dire)
dialog: Understand what I'm saying to you?
dialog: I’m trying to protect you guys here!
text: UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS: Eli, now back in his pajamas, quietly
text: approaches the top of the STAIRCASE -- there’s silence, then:
speaker_heading: HAL (0.S.)
dialog: Get the hell out. Now.
scene_heading: DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS: Hal’s anger now barely controlled --
text: jabs his finger at the door. Jimmy, plea still ringing in his
text: eyes, examines this -- and turns. Sets down the water glass --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It’s funny. Cause I came in here --
dialog: marvelling at this place like the
dialog: house time forgot, but you made
dialog: changes, didn’t you?
text: He grabs his jacket, moves for the door and slows. Motions.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (fumbles with his coat)
dialog: I don’t see myself in any a these
dialog: pictures -- not a one. My room?
dialog: It’s gone. You’ve got your
dialog: replacement son up there in my bed.
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS: Eli, hearing Jimmy refer to him like
text: this, blinks -- and pauses. Those words hurt.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (0.S.)
dialog: You erased every trace’a me. Didn't
dialog: you? That how proud I make you?
dialog: Would Mom’ve wanted that?
speaker_heading: HAL (0.S.)
dialog: Your mother’d be disgusted right
dialog: now. Get the fuck outta my house.
dialog: I’m not telling you again.
text: DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS: Jimmy nods. Some father. SLAMS the
text: door as he GOES. Leaves Hal to watch him trail away alone...
text: We HOLD on Hal here. His face. All of this familiar.
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: EXT. HROBSKY HOME - PRE-DAWN
text: Eli STRAINS again. Loading lumber back into Hal's truck. Hal
text: slams a piece into place. Visibly grumpier than usual.
text: Hal hands Eli a piece of paper en route to closing up the
text: garage. SLAMMING it shut.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Here. Things I need done today.
dialog: Before I get home.
text: Eli looks. It's a LIST of chores like a million miles long.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Today? Ever since Jimmy --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: -- Jimmy's got nothing to do with
dialog: it. I'm keeping you out of trouble.
text: Hal climbs into his truck without another word, starts up and
text: pulls away. Eli watches him go a moment. What the hell?
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - BEDROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: IN THE HALLWAY: We HEAR THE WEAPON power to life behind Eli’s
text: closed bedroom door. PULSATING.
text: ANGLE: ELI in his room. Holding it up now. Its SIGHTING
text: SYSTEM flickers into view. He grins, inspecting its contours
dialog: up close...
text: And moves to a STANDING MIRROR ahead. MUGS at his reflection
text: with THE WEAPON. MASSIVE in his hands. Eli poses with it a
text: few times -- and grins. Begins QUICK-DRAWING with the SPACE
text: WEAPON on his own reflection. SHWIP! SWHIP! SHWIP!
text: He stops. Beat. Listening for the sound of Hal’s truck, and --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: What’d you say?
speaker_heading: (DRAWS REAL FAST)
dialog: Want summa this, huh?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: One of those dumps along 8 mile near Woodward. Jimmy, hungover
text: at the edge of a shoddy bed -- eyes the ibuprofin Hal gave
text: him. Looking like death. Searching the air for options.
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - LIVING ROOM - DUSK
dialog: 
text: The place is spotless. Eli’s watching TV when Hal ENTERS --
text: CROSSES and DROPS an arm-load of SCRAP METAL onto the CARPET.
speaker_heading: Eli JOLTS --
speaker_heading: HAL
text: My maglight mysteriously reappears
dialog: right where it's supposed to be --
dialog: and I'm not gonna get curious? Took
dialog: me all of five seconds to find that
text: stash behind the garage. Explain.
text: Eli’s trapped. Locks up -- debates denying it until he sees
text: the look on Hal’s face -- thinks better of it.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: ... there’s a couple scrap yards
dialog: that pay money for --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: -- scrapping? You're scrapping?
dialog: Where did all this come from?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: A place off Grand River.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Did this place, like my lot, have a
dialog: fence around it that said stay out?
scene_heading: EXT. HROBSKY HOME - DUSK
text: Eli STOMPS down the stairs of the front stoop behind Hal.
text: Both of them headed for Hal's truck --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I've got a directory of property
dialog: developers at the site. You're
dialog: gonna call every single one you've
dialog: broken into, tell them what you did
dialog: and pray to God they accept your
dialog: apology --
text: And Eli STOPS. In disbelief of how bad Hal is freaking out --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: WHY? It’s just a bunch of old metal --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: -- that wasn’t yours, Elijah! None
dialog: of it.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: HAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Now get in the truck, or do I call
dialog: the police instead? Your decision.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. HAL'S TRUCK - WOODWARD AVE - NIGHT
text: Hal and Eli ride. Eli not speaking. Angry, humiliated. After
text: a moment, he GRUMBLES something as we JOSTLE with potholes...
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: What'd you say?
text: Eli doesn’t respond.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I catch you stealing but I’m the
dialog: bad guy? That’s it?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I didn't hurt anybody -- it’s stuff
dialog: that’s been sitting there for years --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Everything that’s ever been stolen
dialog: ever was something that was just
text: sitting there.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I don’t even know why I listen to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You don’t have a choice, I’m your
dialog: father --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: No you’re not. Only reason I’m here

dialog: replacement kid --
text: Hal looks at Eli. HOLDS. Driving. Throws on his blinker.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CORKTOWN - NIGHT
text: The epicenter of Detroit’s more recent gentrification. Hal
text: pulls up to a CONSTRUCTION SITE. A condo high-rise for rich
text: kids moving in from the burbs. His TRUCK rumbles to a stop --
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Where’d you hear that? Someone tell
dialog: you that?
text: Eli doesn’t answer.
dialog: 27.
text: Hal puts it in park. Collects himself.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I’m gonna say this to you once, and I
dialog: want you to hear me. You are nobody's
dialog: replacement.
text: Hal goes quiet a moment. Chooses his words carefully, but
dialog: with conviction.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You're not somebody’s guilt trip.
dialog: You're not some booby-prize.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You’re our son. But your mother’s
dialog: gone now, so it’s my job to pull you
text: as far back from the ledge’a bad
dialog: decisions as possible -- and I’m
dialog: doing the best I can without her.
dialog: This may not always make us best
dialog: buddies, but hopefully it’1l mean
dialog: the difference between you turning
dialog: out okay -- and you not. That’s why
dialog: we're here. That’s why I’m hard on
dialog: you.
text: Beat. Eli softens -- but only a little. Hal holds on him.
text: Silence passes. Eli’s unmoving. Hal shakes his head. EXHALES.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CORKTOWN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Hal and Eli get out, crossing up the street towards a sign
text: labeled SOUTH ENTRANCE. Hal pulls out HIS KEYS --
text: -- and sees the CHAIN around the GATE has been CUT. The
text: PADLOCK dangles imperceptibly off to the side.
text: Hal slows. Grave. Intercepts Eli, directs him back to the
text: truck. Hands him the keys.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Wait in the truck a minute.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Go. I‘’1l be back.

scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

text: scratching out Joni Mitchell’s copacetic hymnal: HELP ME.
dialog: Hal moves for this, fast and --
scene_heading: INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MANAGER'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: -- opens the trailer door. It SWINGS open and Hal lays eyes
text: on JIMMY and the SIX-ODD SHADY CRIMINALS in here with him.
text: A SAFE behind Hal’s desk has been BROKEN OPEN. The last of
text: the CASH that was in his safe is being stuffed into a BLACK
speaker_heading: GARBAGE BAG --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Dad -- what the FUCK --

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: This is dad? Hey dad.
speaker_heading: HAL

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: It isn’t?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Please -- Dad --
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Shh. Jimmy. Your father’s talking.

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You were saying?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I don't have a gripe with you.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: But we gotta put this money back.

speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: -- Yeah.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Huh.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: NO --

dialog: We can argue, but -- does that mean
dialog: he can’t call me when an emergency
dialog: comes up? We’re family, we can set

speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Why are you all sweaty?
dialog: Jimmy stalls a second --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: -- cause I raced down there to get
dialog: you, smart ass. You know none’a these
dialog: neighborhoods are particularly great
dialog: for leaving kids around unsupervised
dialog: and shit.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Am I right?
text: Eli holds a moment. True. But wary. Jimmy returns attention
text: to the road ahead. PUTS the PEDAL to the floor --
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Silence. Jimmy's tending to his injuries. Trying to. The
text: facade is dropped in here. And Jimmy's reeling --
text: He looks to his expression in the mirror. Stems the tide.
text: His heart won’t stop POUNDING. Jimmy chokes back on emotion.
text: Tries to straighten. Next moves. Next moves. Next moves...
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

dialog: guess so. Okay.
dialog: (nods to Eli)
dialog: Yeah, he's here. Wanna talk to him?
dialog: Oh. Yeah. Okay. Sounds good.
text: Jimmy fake hangs up. Clicks his tongue as though digesting.
text: He’s had some time to work on his aura of calm now, but the
text: cracks are still slightly visible. He paces to the fridge --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: This is gonna blow your mind.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It's fucked up down there. Like --
dialog: all hands on deck bad. This spill?
dialog: It’s gonna take like four to six
dialog: days to clean up. That’s pulling
dialog: round the clock shifts --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Did they catch the guys?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ELI
text: The guys who broke in.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh. Uh. No. I dunno. But listen.
dialog: Dad's gonna be down there all night
dialog: tonight and non-stop -- the next
dialog: couple days working on this.
dialog: Eli takes this in. Huh. Considering what this means...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And he says. This is what he said
dialog: to me -- he doesn’t want you around
text: here unsupervised causing a bunch
dialog: of trouble. Won’t have it.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Yeah, that sounds like Dad --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: He was talking about doing some,

dialog: after-school type thing for you --
dialog: like a daycare thing --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Daycare?? I’m twelve, I’m not --
dialog: Jimmy HOLDS up a finger --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I talked to him. It wasn’t easy, as
dialog: you know -- cause he’s not exactly
dialog: super happy with me either.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I tied it into our whole thing. Me,
dialog: him and you. We’re in a state.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: And in terms of family now, it’s
dialog: just us. Like. I’ve been away,

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I said maybe it’d be good for us to

dialog: now. It took him a second -- but he’s pretty convincing...
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Like. All of us?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah, man! Me you and dad. Well.
dialog: Just you and me at first -- since
dialog: he’s got his thing to deal with,

speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Meet us where?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You remember that cottage we all

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Heads up, though -- I think I might
dialog: just go either way. I’ve been

dialog: for too damn long.
dialog: (then)
dialog: So you want adventure or chores?
dialog: Your call.
text: Moment of truth. Eli eyes the phone in his hands...

speaker_heading: THE WEAPON.
scene_heading: INT. HROBSKY HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT

dialog: 
text: Silence. And we return to this MONSTROSITY of a structure.

text: Silent. Eerie. Hard to make out in the darkness --
text: ONE OF THEM tosses a fistfull of what look like MARBLES into

text: FAN OUT. ILLUMINATING the darkness. And WE REVEAL:
text: The two FIGURES are wearing the same type of OTHER-WORLDLY
text: ARMOR we saw on the ALIEN BODIES Eli discovered here earlier.
dialog: We'll call these figures THE CLEANERS. And we can take a
dialog: guess as to what they're looking for.
text: They move through the space, each using SCANNING DEVICES as
text: they go. One slows -- keys a command in and --
text: FOOTSTEPS in gravel and dust illuminate. Eli's footsteps.
text: SEVERAL of the marble-like devices SWOOP IN overhead, slow --

dialog: 40.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. HAL'S TRUCK - FREEWAY - IOWA - LATER

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Rise and shine. Welcome to Iowa...
text: Eli looks up. Sees infinite expanses of farmland. That's it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

scene_heading: INT. SUPER TRUCK STOP - DAY

text: All-in-one trucker paradise coves.
dialog: These places are really weird but

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Most importantly though --

speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: Fully functional old school arcades.
scene_heading: INT. SUPER TRUCK STOP - ARCADE - DAY

dialog: remember it. Don't even lie. Jimmy's enthralled...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You gotta picture coming up to this
dialog: thing in 94 at like a roller rink
dialog: or something -- a game that had
dialog: Machine guns you could use to shoot
dialog: evil cyborgs --

speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Really?
text: Jimmy shoves a fist full of quarters into Eli’s hand.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Here. Take over. I’ve gotta grab
dialog: something from the truck --
scene_heading: EXT. SUPER TRUCK STOP - DAY
text: Jimmy's HOISTED a clunky toolbox out of Hal’s extended cab.
text: Reaching for a SCREWDRIVER, he crosses the lot -- cautious.
text: He moves for a CAR parked in silence around the side --
text: -- leans down fast and begins unscrewing its PLATES.
scene_heading: INT. SUPER TRUCK STOP - CHECK-OUT - A SHORT TIME LATER
dialog: 
text: Jimmy now grips a carton of smokes, energy drinks and a bag
text: of chips on the counter. He turns as Eli walks up --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What'd you get?
text: -- Eli tosses in a bag of combos and a 20 oz coke. Jimmy pays
dialog: hurriedly with a new hundred dollar bill --
text: Eli idles, meanwhile, looks into a nearby dining area --
text: Where A FAMILY OF FOUR, a MOTHER, FATHER and TWO SONS right
text: around Eli’s age, are eating together. Gabbing.
text: Very likely also on vacation. But in a way that tells us:
text: This is a happy, functional family. The moment’s INTERRUPTED
text: as Jimmy slaps Eli’s combos and soda into his hands --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: C’mon -- the open road is calling.
scene_heading: INT. TATTERED HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: ANGLE: we’re moving up the short hallway en route toward’s
text: Taylor’s gross and disgusting kitchen.
text: TAYLOR -- with his leg crudely bandaged, is seated atop his

dialog: 42.
text: The curtains are closed. Light from outside fights its way in
dialog: via JAGGED SLIVERS here and there --
text: What sounds at first like LOUD BREATHS coming from Taylor
text: become SOBS. Weird whimpers GASPING out between --
text: WE MOVE around him now until we can see his face. Tears and
text: hurt and loss swilling outward past bloodshot eyes and a
text: tweaker’s stare. Taylor STANDS, PACES -- movements erratic.
text: Growing moreso. Caged. Until he turns, EXPLODES -- FLIPS his

scene_heading: INT/EXT. HAL'S TRUCK - IOWA FREEWAYS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Jimmy and Eli DRIVE. TRAVERSING the featureless endlessness

dialog: again, and then --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So. You got a girlfriend?
text: Eli looks at him. Shrugs.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's either the best or worst

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you really not know?
text: Eli looks at Jimmy.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: It's none of your business.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: But I'm family. You can share that
dialog: shit with me --
dialog: (Eli stays quiet)
dialog: Don't get me wrong -- I'd be up for
dialog: telling you about my love life, but
dialog: I just got out of prison. All my
dialog: shit ranges from uncomfortable to
dialog: downright terrifying. No?
dialog: (still nothing)
dialog: Suit yourself -- so there was this

speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Named Rafi -- who kept sneaking me

dialog: You don’t wanna hear the rest a’my
dialog: story? It’s got a happy ending --
dialog: (beat, grinning)
dialog: -- get it? Are you old enough to

text: and grins. Outside, they pass a SIGN: WELCOME TO NEBRASKA!
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - RURAL NEBRASKA - DUSK
text: ANGLE: We're parked. Carefully around the side out of view
text: from the road. Jimmy reaches into his satchel for the BLACK

speaker_heading: JIMMY (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Go to town. Sky’s the limit.

speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: You know all this stuff is bad for

dialog: nutritional value here --
text: -- Jimmy's distracted. Listening to the sound of POLICE
text: SIRENS in approach. Holding until they pass. Jimmy watches a
text: HIGHWAY PATROL CAR RACE by the hotel -- and it’s GONE.
text: Jimmy sees that Eli noticed the whole thing. Offers a smile.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Old habits.
dialog: (then, turns)
dialog: Alright. Fine. Kid wants a Kale salad
dialog: apparently. Let’s go, Jenny Craig.

speaker_heading: ELI

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No, like -- I'm talking about in a

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Now's your chance, man. Go, go, go!
text: Eli smiles, beat.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Twenty bucks if I make it to six.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Pssh. Fifty.
text: Eli accepts. Crosses -- and BEGINS DOING CARTWHEELS across

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: With the shower running, Eli's brought the DUFFLE BAG into the
text: bathroom. THE WEAPON is out and TURNED ON. Eli’s using the
text: TARGETING SYSTEM to take aim at different objects --
text: -- Eli's hand grazes the trigger a moment. Doesn't pull.
text: Curiosity growing. Eli eyeballs THE WEAPON in his hands.
dialog: What are you?
text: On the left side of the gun, along the lower barrel, Eli
text: spots a blinking GREEN NODE. Not a trigger, something else --
text: -- cautiously, he runs his finger across it --
text: KR-SHRRR-VRRRP. The WEAPON JOLTS in his hands as he does. Two
text: sleek appendages extend sideways like recoil dampeners --
text: -- the BARREL SHORTENS. Like a SAWED OFF SHOTGUN --
text: Eli holds a moment in awe of this thing’s self-adjusting
text: design. Tries it AGAIN -- and THE WEAPON takes on YET ANOTHER
text: CONFIGURATION. Different MODES. Insane.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: Eli exits the bathroom, THE WEAPON inside the duffle again.
text: Washed up, ready for bed. He looks --
text: Jimmy's passed out on his bed. The empty fifth now dangling
text: from his fingertips. BUT -- left out on the table stand:
text: Is a pair of CHUCK TAYLORS maybe one size too big. Beat. Eli
text: looks this gift over -- a note on hotel stationary reads:
text: HOOKED YOU UP AS PROMISED. BIG BROTHER.
text: Eli grins. Looks to Jimmy -- and spots his packed satchel at
text: the base of nightstand. Poking into view is the corner of a
text: framed PICTURE. Eli moves closer and pulls it into view...
dialog: 46.
text: ... it’s a familiar FRAMED PHOTO. The image of a YOUNGER HAL
text: with his arms around Jimmy’s MOTHER. Jimmy must've swiped it
text: from the living room before they left.
text: Eli looks to Jimmy, passed out -- why would he have this?
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ROOMS - WANDERING - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Eli moves through the space in early morning light. Weaving
text: through modest corridors of closed doors -- Eli slows --

text: the hotel’s tiny pool. The GROUNDSKEEPER looks up, sees Eli.
speaker_heading: GROUNDSKEEPER
dialog: Morning. Up with the sunrise, huh?
text: Eli shrugs. The Groundskeeper eyes him a moment. Smiles.
speaker_heading: GROUNDSKEEPER
dialog: There’s never enough time in the
dialog: day, am I right?
text: The Groundskeeper goes back to his work -- Eli watches him
text: go, then sits, his legs dangling through the railing --
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATE MORNING
text: Piercing WHITE LIGHT stabs through windows even with the
text: curtains drawn. Eli's shaking Jimmy to wake up.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Jimmy. Jimmy.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hmmmm? Wha?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: We're supposed to check out twenty
dialog: minutes ago.
text: Dammit. Jimmy mumbles, incoherent. Fumbles for the truck keys.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Uh. Kay. Pull the truck around and
dialog: I'll be right out.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I can't drive.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: No. Like -- I don't know how.
text: Jimmy opens one eye at Eli, wiping away an eyelash booger.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT LOT BEHIND THE HOTEL - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Jimmy, looking like death behind his sunglasses -- smokes and

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Now the trick to perfecting the
dialog: neutral slam --
text: Eli's BEHIND THE WHEEL of Hal's truck just ahead. REVVING it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Is not panicking when you drop it

dialog: left, and keep your foot on the gas
dialog: no matter what! Don’t be scared!
dialog: (re: engine revving)
dialog: No matter what happens! More!
text: Eli does. He's in NEUTRAL. Revs the engine into the red --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Like this?? Are you serious?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Just trust me, okay?! HOLD IT AND --
text: Eli looks to the dash. HAL'S TRUCK ENGINE like a snarling
dialog: monster at the brink --
speaker_heading: ELI JIMMY
dialog: NOW? NOW!
text: Eli throws it into DRIVE. HOLDS the WHEEL LEFT as the truck
text: LUNGES FORWARD and SPRAYS GRAVEL -- FISHTAILING away --
text: Jimmy, behind him, dodging the CLOUD of dust that's kicked up
text: in Eli's wake as he TEARS away behind the wheel.
dialog: 48.
text: Doing 40 mph DOUGHNUTS. A CLOUD of DUST KICKING UP around the
dialog: truck.
text: ANGLE: Eli at the wheel of Hal's truck. The world a whirling

text: while gripping the wheel.
scene_heading: EXT. WYOMING - RURAL FREEWAY - DAY
text: Hal's truck, covered in dust now, SAILS past a SIGN: WELCOME

text: to Jimmy. He calls over his shoulder--
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What do you think of performance
dialog: art? You like that kinda thing?
scene_heading: EXT. MINESHAFT - SIDE LOT - NIGHT
text: Pulsing MUSIC echoes. Eli stands alone in a parking lot lit
text: by neon SIGNS. Jimmy, standing across the lot at the side
text: door of what’s obviously a STRIP CLUB, is discretely COUNTING
text: OUT a FEW HUNDREDS and handing it all over to a BOUNCER TYPE.
text: After a moment the guy nods. Opens the door wider for Jimmy,
text: who WHISTLES to Eli and waves him over...
scene_heading: INT. THE MINESHAFT - STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
dialog: This place is everything you'd expect a place named the
text: MINESHAFT to be. Local digs and local dregs.
text: Mountain girls with curvy, freckled edges and smiles pass a
text: wide-eyed ELI. NONE are wearing clothes.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Are you sure this is okay?
text: Jimmy, with the satchel at his side, takes a shot with a beer.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Definitely a million percent.
text: Eli looks around, there are maybe FIVE CUSTOMERS in here max.
text: That and a BOOTH of COWBOY-TYPES in the faraway corner.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Here.
text: Jimmy's pulled out a large wad of singles. Winks. Hands them
dialog: to Eli.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: For the girls!
text: Eli accepts, confused, not sure what exactly he’s supposed to
dialog: do with this money but playing as though he does.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (grins)
dialog: You do know that’s the whole point
dialog: of this place, right? You give the
dialog: money to the girls. Or your
dialog: favorite girl --
text: A scantily clad redhead strolls up --
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You want a dance, honey?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Just getting settled, maybe ina
dialog: minute?
text: She nods, departs, Eli sheepish as she passes, takes out his
text: INHALER and PUFFS as he watches her to go -- Jimmy grins --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You okay there?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: It’s my asthma.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Your heart rate’s up. It happens.
text: Jimmy maintains his grin, Eli defensively hides the INHALER.
text: Aware of the fact that it doesn’t help his street cred. He
text: looks, pockets the cash Jimmy just gave him --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Dad would not be happy about this.
dialog: (re: around)
dialog: You talk to him today?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (watching the dancers)
dialog: We texted. He was crashing out, had
text: -- two back-to-back all-nighters.
dialog: He says hi and that we'd better be
dialog: behaving. I told him we were...
dialog: (smiles to a passing girl)
dialog: +. drink your coke, man. Watch the
dialog: show, it's what we're here for.
text: Above, the lights dim for the next act. MUSIC STARTS.
text: AHEAD: the battered contours of this building give way to an
dialog: antiquated stage. Perfect for what happens next -- as a YOUNG
text: WOMAN steps into view -- the kind that shuts you up.
dialog: 52.
text: It’s MILLY. From the earlier scene. A pistol in go-go shorts
text: now, in costume, her eyes electric under stage-lights.
text: Moving under the sway of the music -- her clothing departs
text: one article at a time. And so it goes. And she sees --
text: Eli and Jimmy. Watching her, stupefied. Jimmy -- finishes his
text: beer, signals for another, watching -- he looks at Eli --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (over the music)
dialog: I like her! She seems nice!
scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE BOOTH - IN BACK - LATER
text: cuT TO: a private dance. Milly and Jimmy up close. Jimmy's
text: buzzing, Milly's green cat eyes working their charm --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: So who’s that with you?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: My little brother.
dialog: (she eyes this)
dialog: Adopted. Obviously. But -- brother.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: He’s been out there himself a while --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: He's a twelve-year-old surrounded
text: by an endless supply of pop and
dialog: half naked women, he’s just fine --
dialog: (grins)
dialog: -- what's your name?
text: She smiles back. Not even about to tell him that.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No wait. I can guess. Sparkles.
dialog: Milly maintains that grin.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sparkles? I’m Jimmy.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Hi Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'm gonna be direct with you,
dialog: Sprinkles, I have a lot of money on
dialog: me.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tonight I'm gonna get really drunk
dialog: and my brother’s gonna get really
dialog: caffeinated and it'd be awesome if
dialog: you'd join us.
text: Milly maintains her smile. Doesn't say anything back, but...
scene_heading: INT. THE MINESHAFT - NIGHT
scene_heading: SHOTS. SHOTS. SHOTS. COCA-COLA for Eli. Milly's joined Jimmy
text: and Eli in their booth. Jimmy's flying, toasts --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Cheers! To the Hrobsky brothers. On
dialog: the road and making new friends!!
text: The commotion Jimmy's causing starting to draw attention.
text: That group of COWBOY-TYPES in the faraway booth are getting a
text: good look at him...
text: WE HONE IN: on one particular guy in their midst. Built. This
text: is LEE (50s), rugged with deep-sunk eyes.
text: cuT TO: Jimmy doing another round. This time with nearly
text: EVERY DANCER in here. A whole LINEUP of scantily clad women --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: To the ladies of The Mineshaft!
scene_heading: INT. THE MINESHAFT - JIMMY & ELI'S TABLE - LATER
dialog: 
text: While Jimmy drinks and flirts with ANOTHER DANCER, Milly
text: chats up Eli. She’s thrown a shall across her shoulders. Both
text: are now sipping cokes.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Seventh grade. Next year.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: That's a big year --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Where'd you go to school?
text: Milly looks Eli over. Likes this kid, the old-soul quality
text: about Eli. Emerging now that he's gotten used to this place.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Where I'm from.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Colorado?
dialog: 54.
text: Milly's accent is more Carolina-bent.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I'm passing
dialog: through like you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where you guys going?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: A cottage. Near Tahoe. We used to
dialog: go there before my mom died.
text: Milly regards that, nods. Looks. At Jimmy --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: And your dad let you get in a car
dialog: with this crazy guy?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I guess --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (overheard that)
dialog: I will let you know this is only
dialog: his first gentleman's club -- he’s
dialog: here to become a man. We’re doing
dialog: life lessons.
text: Jimmy throws that imperceptible wink at Eli again. Grins. The
text: other dancer reels Jimmy back in -- Milly looks at Eli...
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Is it working? You feel manly now?
text: Eli smiles, but no. Milly nods. Approves of this kid now --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: I'll let you in on something.
dialog: (leans in close)
text: Walking into a strip club never
dialog: made anybody a man, ever. Your
dialog: brother's fun but he's just as much
dialog: a boy as you are. Don't tell him I
dialog: said that.
text: Eli looks to Jimmy. Laughing at some joke. Doing yet another
text: shot -- a VOICE calls out to Milly. She's up again next song.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: (smiles at Eli)
dialog: Be good.
text: Eli blushes. Milly turns to go --
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Oh. Hey!
text: Milly slows, looks back -- to see Eli’s pulling the cash
text: Jimmy gave him out of his pocket. All in a big tangled wad.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: This is for you.
text: Eli gives Milly the clump of money -- in her hands -- and the
dialog: transaction is exactly as awkward as you can expect.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: ... thanks.
speaker_heading: OTHER DANCER
dialog: (leaves as well)
dialog: I’1l be back.
text: Jimmy nods. He and Eli alone again for a moment.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Having fun?
text: Eli nods. Watching Milly go. Jimmy lights up a cigarette and
text: lets the music take hold of the scene a beat. A comfortable
text: silence in the tradition of Vincent and Mia.
text: Then. Eli looks at Jimmy, curious about something.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: How come you went to jail?
text: Jimmy looks at Eli mid-drag, considers. EXHALES and ashes.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Grand theft auto. It’s got a ring
dialog: to it, huh?
dialog: (Eli nods)
dialog: That and a few other things.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Stuff you’re too young to hear.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: According to you, I’m old enough to
dialog: be in here --
text: Jimmy grins. Touche. But still -- he’s not saying. So. Eli --
text: after a moment... looks to Jimmy and...
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I don’t got a girlfriend.
text: Beat. Jimmy perks up. Smiles. Breaking down barriers. Ashes.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: The girls at my school are. They’re
dialog: nice. But. Um.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t know. I just don’t talk to
dialog: many kids in my grade.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Lone wolf, huh?
text: Eli shrugs.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I don’t know. I just -- never felt
dialog: like I fit in... anywhere.
text: Jimmy slows. Stews on the implication of that. Toasts small
text: in his rapidly accelerating drunk state.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: Cheers to that.
dialog: Beat. He lets the topic go --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: What’s with you and dad?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: With us?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: He never talks about you much. When
dialog: he does he’s always grumpy. And he
dialog: never took me to visit you.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Would you have wanted to?
text: Jimmy looks at Eli who shrugs. Jimmy adjusts in his seat.
text: Picks at his coat as though searching for lint a moment...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The trouble between me and him, you
dialog: know, it goes back to before you
dialog: were even in the picture...
text: Jimmy looks at Eli. Slows. Smiles a little more and shrugs...
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don’t think he ever saw himself
dialog: in me. He was on one level, I was
dialog: on another --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: -- me having a thing for getting
dialog: into trouble only made it worse.
text: Jimmy sends Eli a look. The liquor now shining in his eyes.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: By the time I was in my teens we
dialog: had our whole thing -- I mean the
dialog: entirety of our relationship --
dialog: down to a sad science. It was
text: arguments and screaming and
dialog: throwing shit with mom crying --
dialog: (Jimmy slows)
dialog: Telling him to go easy on me, then
dialog: him throwing me out of the house,
dialog: calling me a lost cause and whatnot.
text: His eyes suddenly searching inward now. He slows. Toasts.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: «+. until one day I woke up a long
dialog: way from home and I was one. We
dialog: just couldn’t’ve been --
dialog: (bumps fists)
dialog: -- more different.
text: Jimmy stops. Emotion rattles up in his gaze. Beat. He looks
text: away. Silence. Forces a smile but -- he’s angry.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What are we even talking about this
dialog: shit for? We're on vacation -- why
dialog: are we digging up a buncha depressing
dialog: shit from back home? I’m --
text: MUSIC STARTS...
text: Jimmy's searching for distraction. Sees. Milly. Back on stage.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (pounds his drink)
dialog: Perfect. Sprinklers is up. I'm
dialog: gonna go cut a fuckin rug with her.
text: Jimmy JOLTS up out of his chair -- Eli's perplexion over this
dialog: response turning to worry as --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Jimmy --
dialog: 58.
text: UP ON STAGE: Milly looks, sees Jimmy staggering this way.
text: Eyes dead set on joining her --
text: Jimmy moves to climb up the low seats to the stage when --
text: He’s GRABBED. By TWO OF THE COWBOY TYPES from the booth.
text: Pulling Jimmy down and whirling him right into the face of --
text: LEE. Who's giving Jimmy a perplexed but unnerving smile --
text: Beat. Jimmy looks at him. Sloppy now. Smiles right back --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Fuck me, it's Lyle Lovett --
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Lee, actually. I own this club.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Nice place, Lyle. Do you mind? I'm
text: trying to join the lady on stage --
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: We don't allow Johns on the stage.
text: Beat. Jimmy eyes him a moment. Grins. Winks at Lee --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Ah. I get you --
dialog: (reaches )
dialog: Well how about --
text: Jimmy proffers a crumpled, gnarled HUNDRED. Drunk. Wands it
text: around in Lee's face like an asshole --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You and your friends just look the
dialog: other way. Go on. Buy yourselves a
dialog: nice round of sarsaparillas --
text: Eli -- across the room, can’t hear what’s being said but can
text: sense the energy turning bad -- cautiously getting up --
text: Milly, on stage, has approached to assert calm --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Lee, I got it -- he'll siddown --
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Shut your fuckin mouth, Milly.
dialog: And that's a scary order that's just come from Lee. He's dead-
text: staring Jimmy now. All the cordiality gone. Danger visible...
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Look at you. Making jokes like that
dialog: in my bar. How big’re your balls,
dialog: son? Pretty large?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Let me on stage and I’1l show you.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What if I just kicked your teeth in?
dialog: Okay. This is real. This is about to happen -- and Jimmy --
dialog: it’s scary to say, but in a way, he wants this fight.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You could. You really could...
dialog: (thinking on it...)
dialog: «+. won't help you with that sting
dialog: above your nose, though.
text: Jimmy LURCHES FORWARD and HEAD-BUTTS Lee between the eyes.
text: Lee SCREAMS and goes TOPPLING BACKWARDS and immediately --
text: -- the BEATING COMMENCES. FIVE COWBOY TYPES SWARM Jimmy and --
text: BEGIN PUMMELLING HIM. Eli's jaw DROPPING. Already cautiously
text: approaching, Eli comes RUSHING up. Milly tries to intervene,
text: gets KNOCKED DOWN as a result --
text: Jimmy's GANG STOMPED -- a total shitshow broken out --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: STOP! STOP! Let him g --
text: Eli's grabbed. Hoisted into the air and carried. KICKING and
text: SCREAMING for Jimmy -- Eli’s able to watch as his brother
text: vanishes behind a flurry of BOOTS and PUMMELLING --
speaker_heading: ELI
scene_heading: Let me GO! Get OFF ME -- LEMME -—-
text: Eli's jettisoned from the bar. The door SHUTS. And we remain
text: in here with Jimmy as he’s brutalized -- CUSTOMERS WHOOP --
text: Dancers recoil -- Jimmy’s hoisted up onto his KNEES -- Lee,
text: blood streaming down his face from the headbutt, steps in and
dialog: starts WORKING Jimmy over --
text: An ugly scene getting WORSE and WORSE until --
text: The sound of THE WEAPON POWERING UP is heard over the music.
text: Heads turn. Jimmy barely conscious -- looks up to see --
dialog: 60.
text: ELI. Having re-entered. THE WEAPON is in his hands. Powered
text: up and HUMMING and MENACING.
text: Silence. Every face in the bar now taking in the sight of
text: what looks like a kid with some kind of VIDEO GAME TOY --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Let him go. Right now.
text: Eli's shaking to pieces. Terrified. But holds his ground...
text: Lee spits, smiles. Turns -- a couple snickers follow. Eli
dialog: takes this in, looks to Jimmy --
text: Swivels THE WEAPON toward a POOL TABLE AND ---
speaker_heading: BLAAAAAAAMM !
text: LITERALLY EXPLODES THE FUCKING THING. BLASTING its FIERY GUTS
text: straight through a nearby wall -- AN ENERGY BLAST. SCREAMS
scene_heading: ERUPT -- Everyone THROWN -- even Eli RECOILS --
text: -- backward in flabbergasted shock. Flaming debris spews --
dialog: music STOPS --
text: Eli’s got their attention now -- gripping a WEAPON the likes
dialog: of which these people have never seen -- and --
text: Jimmy is DROPPED. Collapses to the floor -- heaving, a mess --
text: MILLY springs forward. HELPING Jimmy up in shocked silence --
text: Lee watching angrily as the trio hobbles for the exit --
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: (to Milly)
dialog: Bitch, where the hell do you think
dialog: you're going?
scene_heading: EXT. MINESHAFT - MINUTES LATER
text: HAL'S TRUCK STARTS UP, pulling out FAST -- Milly's at the
text: wheel and Eli, still gripping the gun, watches as --
text: -- the OTHER DANCER who was sitting with them earlier races
text: out into the lot. Gripping Milly’s GYM BAG. She HURLS it into
text: the back of HAL’s truck as it ROARS PAST out of THE LOT --
speaker_heading: OTHER DANCER
dialog: Hope you know what you’re DOING,
dialog: Mill!
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKIES - BACK ROADS - NIGHT
dialog: And HAL'S TRUCK RACES PAST --
speaker_heading: JIMMY (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Stop -- stop the truck -- now --
scene_heading: EXT. BACK COUNTRY - GRAZING FIELD - COLORADO - NIGHT
text: Headlights break the surreal silence of high-mountain cattle
text: country -- Milly pulling over...
text: The extended cab door JOLTS open and Jimmy, looking like half-
text: mashed shit, tumbles out. White as a sheet -- stumbles off a
text: few steps. Stops. Milly following Jimmy out, Eli too --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Hey! Get back in, we gotta --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: You need to get to a hospital --
text: Jimmy's staring at Eli -- points -- to THE WEAPON --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What the fuck is that?!?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: It's a gun.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That is not a gun. Guns shoot
dialog: bullets -- that thing just exploded
dialog: a goddam pool table --
dialog: (freaking out)
dialog: What is it?? Where did you get it??
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I found it. In this old warehouse
dialog: where I'd been going for scrap...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You found that in a vacant?
dialog: (nevermind, crosses)
dialog: Let me see.
text: Jimmy grabs THE WEAPON and yanks it away before Eli can
text: protest. Still wobbling. He begins fiddling with it --
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Jimmy. You're drunk and you might
dialog: have a concussion -- I don’t think --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'm f-fine. Just wanna look --
text: Jimmy hoists THE WEAPON up. Aims sloppily at a nearby HAY
dialog: ROLL used for cattle grazing -- pulls the trigger --
text: instantly, the weapon seizes -- MAKES AN ALERT SOUND --
text: -- glows a BURNING RED and --
text: Jimmy SCREAMS. YELPS. Drops the weapon. Throws it down --
text: hands singed -- waving them off fast, cursing --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
speaker_heading: The HELL --
text: Jimmy looks at Eli. Not understanding. Then to Milly --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Maybe it doesn’t like you.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You try then.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: I'm not touching that thing.
text: Beat. Jimmy's rubbing his hands. Eli crosses, slow and --
text: picks it up again. Sotto. Looks at Jimmy. Unburned.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So it likes you just fine, huh?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I told you, I just found it. I
dialog: didn't even know what it could do
dialog: until back there.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Had a pretty good idea though, didn't
dialog: you?
text: Beat. Jimmy holds there in stunned disbelief. Turns. Eyes
text: large HAY-ROLL...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Don’t just stand there, let’s see
dialog: it again -- in action. Go on.
dialog: his
dialog: the
dialog: 63.
text: Eli blinks. Looks to Milly then back to Jimmy. Activates the
text: weapon, aims -- and BLOWS the HAYROLL into a sky-born TUFT of
dialog: EMBERS, some of the HAY on FIRE -- fucking awesome --
text: Jimmy recoils, and despite his injuries and state -- whoops.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (points to another)
dialog: Well don’t stop there, man --
text: Eli takes in his older brother’s floored but wowed expression
text: and grins as well. Okay. Takes aim and BLASTS THE HELL out of
text: another one -- Jimmy cackles -- looks at Eli, impressed --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I can't believe you just left that in
dialog: the back of the truck --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: What? You want me walking around
dialog: with it?
text: Beat. And Jimmy HALTS mid-thought. Remembers -- WHIRLS,
text: looking back down the road -- begins stumbling --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh no. Please, no, no, no, no, no --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: What? Jimmy! WHAT?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: My bag. The satchel I was carrying.
dialog: All my money's in it -- I left it
dialog: at the table --
text: Everyone exchanging looks.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: How much are we talking?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I dunno -- 60? 70? Thousand...
text: Eli looks to Jimmy -- surprised --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Thousand?? In a satchel?
scene_heading: EXT. THE MINESHAFT - NIGHT
text: Smoldering smoke still wafts out of this place now.
text: A CRIME SCENE. FIREMEN linger but appear to be wrapping
text: STATE TROOPERS loiter, trying to look badass.
text: MORGAN HUNTER (40s), poised, dressed up as though for a
text: out on the town -- pulls up in an unmarked crown vic.
text: She gets out. High heels clicking. Badges an officer to
text: past police tape. Her badge is FBI. A MAN approaches --
dialog: (30s), her partner.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I was on a date, you know that?
dialog: First one since New York.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Was it going well?
text: Morgan eyes him. Scans the setting --
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: We cooking meth on the dance floor?
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: Statements recount an argument with
text: a disgruntled customer that led to
text: a fight -- and ended with gunfire.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Of some kind.
dialog: (points)
dialog: The most consistent description of
text: what was fired has been a bazooka.
dialog: Perhaps a rocket launcher. Which is
dialog: why we’re here.
text: Morgan looks at him. Perplexed. Rocket launcher?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Any casualties?
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: Just a pool table.

speaker_heading: JAKE
text: Jake nods to an AMBULANCE nearby. LEE, flanked by peers, his

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: See him? That’s Lee Jacobs. Owner
dialog: of this place. Guys got a rep.
dialog: Prostitution, gambling, suspected
dialog: of worse.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: This can be a scary place for a
dialog: girl to work -- which is why I’m
dialog: not surprised that none of their
text: security cameras are hooked up.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're looking good in that dress
dialog: by the way...
text: Morgan snickers. Asshole. And the two step forward into --
scene_heading: INT. THE MINESHAFT - CONTINUOUS
text: -- the aftermath of Eli's damage. The remains of the pool
text: table are everywhere -- mostly visible through the scorched
text: WALL behind the spot where it used to be.
text: Morgan taking in the scope of this. Steps up to the damage.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Wasn’t a rocket launcher. Maybe
dialog: something home-made, but --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's a scary thought. See these
dialog: burns... the way they --
dialog: (points)
dialog: -- ebb like that, consistent stop
dialog: and start patterns -- no clear
dialog: projectile entry point, just --
dialog: (then)
text: Almost looks like a chemical burn,
dialog: but -- no residue, noxious fumes --
text: Okay. This has its hooks in her. Morgan looks to Jake.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: This is the part where I pray that
text: a room full of people in a strip
dialog: club with no working cameras --
dialog: were at least able to provide
dialog: descriptions of the shooter.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: The shooter was a boy. 12-ish. If
dialog: you can believe that. African
dialog: American -- with --
dialog: (checks his notes)
text: An older male, late 20s, Caucasian.
text: And apparently a dancer on staff,
dialog: also 20s, left with them.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Hostage?
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Seems she went willingly.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: That'll make em distinct as far as

text: She turns. Eyes the damage one more time --
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: See what you can dig up on the
text: pair. The two males.
dialog: Both of them moving to leave --
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: We'll need this area sealed off. No

text: Their faces, bio-signatures and vital stats are LOGGED --
text: REVEAL: we're watching this through the POV of THE CLEANERS.

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - COLORADO - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: It'll be 46.82.

text: -- sitting out and open on the bed nearby, silent, until --
text: -- SHRK-CLACK! It JOLTS into STANDBY MODE. She JUMPS. The
text: HARDENED SHIELD exterior snaps into place over it --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: It does that. Here.
text: Milly looks up. Eli’s offering her some more of the SPRITE
text: they're splitting. She nods --
text: He pours. As he does -- she spots -- the ugly scar on Eli’s
text: forearm. Beat. Then she motions.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Where'd you get that? On your arm.
text: Eli looks. Down to his forearm. Covers it, awkward.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: From my parents. Original ones.
text: Milly's smile drifts a minute -- but maintains. Polite.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Mom or dad?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I don’t know. I was a baby --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: (re: Jimmy)
dialog: And that’s how you wound up with --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (nods )
dialog: -- from a shelter. They got me when
dialog: I was a couple months old.
text: Milly nods. Can sense the residual heartache in that. Shifts,
text: tugs at the sleeve of the hoodie she's borrowed from Jimmy --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: (pulls it back)
dialog: My parents gave me these for
dialog: crying... I was about three.
text: She's revealed a small set of dime-sized scars on the back of
text: her hands. Cigarette burns. Beat.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Sometimes people who aren’t ready
dialog: to have kids have em anyway.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You’re adopted too?
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Just a regular old runaway. I left
dialog: home when I was about... three
dialog: years older than you? Been on the
dialog: move ever since.
dialog: (holds up two fingers)
dialog: My whole life, I’ve had to say
dialog: peace to pretty much everyone I
dialog: meet. Sad, but. The way it goes.
text: Eli’s quiet. Doesn’t know what to say to the thought of that.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: (shrugs, re: Jimmy)
dialog: Is this step-dad of yours like him?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: No. No way. He's like -- always
dialog: serious, but. He's okay.
text: Milly leans in closer, moves Eli’s hand from blocking it --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Never hide a scar. It’s proof
dialog: you've been places. Done things.
text: Eli smiles. Small. Jimmy EXITS the bathroom. Showered and
text: having made shoddy attempts to bandage his face --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: (grins, shakes her head)
dialog: Bad. Should've let us take you to
dialog: the hospital.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No. No hospitals.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Well -- you look hideous.
dialog: (rises)
dialog: Let me have a go.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Milly’s cleaning and re-dressing Jimmy’s wounds. One above
text: his eye-brow, another on the side of his face, a few more
text: atop his head -- Jimmy sits still, letting her work --
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So it’s Milly, huh? Is that what
dialog: your boss called you?
text: Milly stays quiet. Looks at him. Jimmy smiles. Nods. A
text: thought comes to him -- looking Milly over...
speaker_heading: JIMMY (PRE-LAP)
dialog: So what’s your angle?
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jimmy and Milly smoke outside on their room’s shoddy stoop.
text: Jimmy’s blotting his face with a plastic bag of hotel ice.
text: Milly looks at him --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Don’t get me wrong. You seem nice,
dialog: you're nice to my brother... but
dialog: you can’t tell me you joined our
dialog: little party here out of the
dialog: kindness of your heart.
text: Milly grins. Still eyeing him. Shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: You got me. The plan was to rip you
dialog: off and bail in the middle of the
dialog: night. Oh wait. You’re broke.
dialog: (obvious beat)
dialog: All my evil plans were for nothing.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I’m just saying you wouldn’t be the
dialog: first girl to --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: That happens to you a lot?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No, just --
dialog: (changes subjects, motions)
dialog: -- we got wheels. You could be
dialog: after that.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Ah. That’s right. Your Michigan
text: truck with Nebraska plates on it.
text: Jimmy slows. Milly’s pointing his tone right back at him.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Remind me. Which of us should be
dialog: worried about the other having an
dialog: angle?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I’m just looking, okay -- for an
dialog: honest answer as to what you’re
dialog: after so we can both be on the same
dialog: page.
dialog: (then)
dialog: That’s all.
text: Beat. Milly looks Jimmy over. A long moment. Considers...
text: ++. and she nods. Something in Milly quiets a moment.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: I was stuck there, alright? No car,
dialog: no way out. Lee has ways of getting
dialog: girls he likes to stay as long as
dialog: he sees fit. Understand?
dialog: (pointed)
text: The two-a ya. Walking in and
dialog: handing it to em was the first time
dialog: I'd seen that happen and I figured
dialog: I better not waste the opportunity.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Did he hurt you? I mean, ever --
text: Milly looks at him. Non-plussed. This is exactly what she
dialog: didn’t want to get into.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: You wanted an honest answer, and I
dialog: gave you one. But I’ve got zero
dialog: interest in being either saved or
dialog: pitied by you. Hear me?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Plus I jumped in cause you’re not
dialog: scary. As in. If you did try
dialog: anything funny I’m pretty sure even
dialog: I could take you in a fist fight.
text: Jimmy takes in the sight of her. Can’t help but admire it.
text: Raises his hands in mock surrender -- reaches for the small
text: cup of sprite he’s brought out with him. Toasts.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: To us bad apples.
text: Milly eyes him, but obliges.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: That thing in there, your brother
dialog: has? You should be calling someone
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Look. We can’t go calling people
dialog: about it for the same reason I
dialog: can’t go to the hospital, which is
dialog: the same reason there are Nebraska
dialog: plates on our truck. Follow?
text: She looks Jimmy over a long moment --
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: (re: Eli)
dialog: He’s a smart kid. Whatever it is
dialog: you've gotten him into -- he’s
dialog: gonna figure it out. Hope you're
dialog: ready for that.
text: Silence. He knows she’s right. Shifts in his footing. And for
text: a moment, the weight he’s holding is visible --
text: She spots it. Acquiesces. Scans the lot -- a thought hangs in
text: her eyes. An angle. Quiet. Debating whether to say.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: What if I knew a way to get your
dialog: money back?
text: She wavers a moment. Looks back to Jimmy...
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: And maybe more.
dialog: (holds )
dialog: If I tell you though, and this is
dialog: if you even want to do it, because
dialog: it won’t be easy -- I want a cut of
dialog: everything you get over the money
dialog: you need returned -- and you guys
dialog: give me a ride west.
text: Milly holds. She's serious.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How far west?
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Until I tell you to stop and let me
dialog: out. No questions asked. Whatever
dialog: it is you’re up to or running from?
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: MILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t want to know, and I expect
dialog: the same courtesy.
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: You ever robbed anybody?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: A couple gas-stations and a three
dialog: series -- the latter’a which I just
dialog: finished a six year bid on.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Comforting. What about card games?
dialog: Lee runs one outside Leadville
dialog: every other week. Next one’s
dialog: tomorrow and if he's got your
dialog: money, it’1l be there.
text: And now, Jimmy's digesting that. Very seriously so.
speaker_heading: MILLY
dialog: Oh. And there’s one other thing I'd
dialog: need.
dialog: OFF Jimmy listening, we --
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - COLORADO - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Eli and Jimmy are unloading bags from the truck -- Milly is
text: visible through windows ahead. Pacing, brushing her teeth.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don’t get the weirdness here --
dialog: I’m asking you to do the same thing
dialog: you did earlier back at that club --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: That’s different --
text: Eli's very, very unsure. Jimmy sees this --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No it's not. This is getting back
dialog: what they stole from us -- what they
dialog: stole from us by beating me up which
dialog: is what forced you to think fast,
dialog: which forced us to run. How’re we
dialog: supposed to be okay with that?
dialog: Beat. Jimmy spun that good -- but Eli’s still wary --
text: Eli is silent, debating.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I just don’t wanna hurt anyone.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: We won't. That’s what I’m saying.
dialog: Scout’s honor. We scare em, but we
dialog: don't hurt em. Promise. Promise.
text: -- and Eli HOLDS. Now weighing this. Considering. Nervous.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hey. We’ve got a giant ray gun.
dialog: They'll be pissing in their pants.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - COLORADO - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAWN
text: Eli wakes. He's on a roll-away cot. Able to see through slats
text: in the blinds. The sun's not yet up. Eli sits, mind churning,
text: looks -- Milly's on one bed, Jimmy’s on the other.
text: Eli sees -- Jimmy's cell and keys on the bed-stand. He
text: quietly reaches for them.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - COLORADO - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAWN
text: Eli's in the driver’s seat. Cell phone in hand. Through the
text: windshield, MOUNTAINS roll away into forever. Eli dials
text: Jimmy’s cell. Waiting -- hoping for an answer.
speaker_heading: HAL'S VOICEMAIL
dialog: This is Hal. Try the office or
dialog: leave a message.
text: Eli's features droop a little, but he listens for the BEEP.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Uh. Hey dad. Jimmy says you're still
dialog: busy. Hope everything’s okay.
dialog: (turns )
dialog: We’re in Colorado, so. There’s
dialog: mountains everywhere. Crazy. I
dialog: guess, see you in Tahoe.
text: Eli pauses. A thought coming to him.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: I'm sorry. About me stealing, if.
dialog: You know, you’re still mad, and you
dialog: still want me to make those phone
dialog: calls I will. Okay. Miss you.
dialog: 74.
text: Eli considers a bit longer. Hangs up. He looks down to the

scene_heading: INT. THE RIPWIRE - DIVE BAR - MORNING

text: of Viking funeral. Taylor’s up front, giving a eulogy.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: He had demons, bad habits... but he
dialog: spent every day of his life doing
dialog: exactly what he wanted to do. He put
dialog: fear in his enemies, lived and worked
dialog: alongside his family, and he never
dialog: compromised. He stepped on the
dialog: throats of those he felt deserved it.
dialog: (emotion ringing)
dialog: My brother Dutch lived his life --
dialog: pure. Which is more than I can say
dialog: for anyone else in this room.
text: Pure vitriol and rage are brimming up Taylor’s gaze. So much
text: so that even as he speaks -- the effect becomes disquieting.
scene_heading: INT. TATTERED HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: YOUNG GRUBBY WOMAN
dialog: The cell you took off the dead guy.
dialog: It rang while you were out.

text: Taylor dismisses the pistol. Kills the oven heat and crosses.
text: Walking now and from here forward with a visible LIMP --

speaker_heading: TAYLOR

speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (re: the hardcopies)
text: Zero comps. At all. So. They leave

text: in close quarters that has the

text: Morgan looks at Jake, who nods. Morgan’s clearly exhausted.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So look. You're going home at a

speaker_heading: MORGAN
text: Back out to the strip club.
speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: If you want to meet a good dude --
speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: MORGAN

text: Jimmy and Milly ride upfront. Milly's at the wheel. Jimmy
text: grips his pistol -- Eli eyes this.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So I can look scary like you.

scene_heading: INT/EXT. HAL'S TRUCK - LIVESTOCK CENTER - NIGHT
text: A massive auction complex. Scuzzy. Huge. Hal's truck KILLS

scene_heading: EXT. LIVESTOCK CENTER - CONTINUOUS
text: Approaching. Balaclavas on. Eli gripping THE WEAPON. Slowing

text: Through the SHIPPING lot. TRUCKS with a company emblem
text: loiter. Silent.
text: Skirting to a stop at the shipping doors, a BACK ENTRANCE.
text: Jimmy moves for a nearby WINDOW --
text: BREAKS it. GLASS PANES fall inward to the floor. Jimmy and
text: Eli HOLD -- waiting to see if there's a response --
text: Nothing. So Jimmy motions Eli to stay put, shimmies inside,
text: vanishes. Eli alone, Heartbeat climbing --
text: SHK-CLICK. The hardbolt UNLATCHES on the nearby door. Jimmy
text: appears, motions Eli in, PROPS the DOOR OPEN with a rock.
scene_heading: INT. LOADING GARAGE - LIVESTOCK CENTER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It's dark. The TARGETING SYSTEM on Eli's weapon the only

scene_heading: INT. PROCESSING - LIVESTOCK CENTER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: ROWS and ROWS of bovine. Cows huddled in pens in the dead of

text: MOVING through this massive corridor of fenced-off sections
text: toward -- a SOURCE OF LIGHT ahead... a DOORWAY...
text: Jimmy, pistol out, inches the door OPEN. VOICES UP THE

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hey Lyle -- tell all your buddies
dialog: about what happened at the club?
dialog: You let us know if you need another

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Clever. Here's how this goes -- me
dialog: and this guy are gonna walk to the

dialog: And the rest of you are gonna play
dialog: the FUCKING STATUE GAME. Clear?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Lyle. I’d like my money back. On

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LIVESTOCK CENTER - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Where we going? Tell me first
dialog: before you do shit.
speaker_heading: LEE
text: There's a safe. Under the sink.
text: Moving for an INDUSTRIAL SINK against a nearby wall. Slow.
text: Lee has to crouch to get at the cabinet doors below, to
text: reveal -- sure enough -- there’s a SAFE. Lee moves --
text: -- and Jimmy inches the barrel up to the back of Lee's head.
text: Takes a DEEP BREATH.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I'm just gonna open it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Two things first. One. I told you
dialog: tell me before you make any moves.
dialog: Do that again I'll blow your head
dialog: clean off. Two. My barrel's staying
dialog: right here until I see my money
dialog: coming outta that thing only. If.
dialog: If -- from one thief to another --
dialog: you've done what I’d do if I were
dialog: you -- and there's a pistol stashed
dialog: in there for just this occasion? I
dialog: want you to know: your life is
text: right now, at very serious risk.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now. I can give you a way out of
dialog: that scenario -- but you gotta let

dialog: can work out a plan. So. Think real
dialog: hard about your buddies in there,
dialog: about any family you got -- and
dialog: tell me:
dialog: (another beat, re: safe)
dialog: Is there a pistol waiting for you?
text: Lee's quiet for a long moment. We can see a world of thought
text: churning in his expression...
text: WITH ELI: the pock-marked face of the room's SCARIEST PLAYER
text: is GLARING at Eli now. Clearly debating a MOVE for something
text: at his waistline -- the SILENCE BUILDING --
text: WITH JIMMY & LEE: Hovering over the safe...
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: There’s a 38.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (nods, beat)
dialog: Okay. Dial the combo -- unlock it,
text: but don't pull back the door.
text: WITH ELI: The SCARIEST PLAYER'S hand FLINCHES. Eli sees it.
text: Looks at the player. Who glares right back. Without a word --
text: a mutiny is beginning to swell in this room... OTHERS saw
text: that gambit -- now contemplating moves of their own...
dialog: «+. without a word, we know it. Eli's losing control.
text: WITH JIMMY: The safe POPS open. Lee doesn't open it. He
text: slowly stands and steps aside. Able to see the pistol. Lee's
text: eyes waiting for Jimmy to make a false move so he can lunge --
text: But Jimmy doesn't take his eyes or aim off Lee. He maneuvers
text: and reaches backward with his free hand for the safe until
text: he's able to GRIP the PISTOL. Jimmy JAMS it into his coat
speaker_heading: POCKET --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Take the bag behind you. Step back
dialog: over here and fill it.
text: -- Lee's expression now GLARING.
text: WITH ELI: Someone’s gonna reach for a WEAPON.
text: WITH JIMMY: watching Lee fill the bag with --
dialog: There's A LOT of money coming out of THAT SAFE. More than
text: what was taken from Jimmy. A LOT MORE. Jimmy HOLDING ON --

text: OFFERS the TAKE OUT BAG to Jimmy. Murderous.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (motions)
dialog: I'll take that hat on your head
dialog: too.
text: WITH ELI: unspoken messages are now being conveyed everywhere

text: Eli nervously adjusts his aim -- from one heavy to another --
text: -- the SCARIEST PLAYER slowly and quietly easing a PISTOL out
dialog: from his waistline --
dialog: 82.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Nothing's changed, folks! Keep em
dialog: UP! UP! UP!
text: -- Jimmy shakily nods to Eli. Sends Eli the all-good wink and
text: nods. Go first. Eli begins BACKING AWAY. Toward the exit --
text: And HAULS it. A fast walk down the exit hallway as Jimmy
text: ditches the Scariest Player’s gun and PUSHES Lee forward
text: toward Eli's former position at the door...
text: WITH JIMMY: Holding a pistol in each hand now. Jesse James
text: inspired. Staring down the room of SCARY CARD PLAYERS.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Now, sorry for the interruption,
dialog: fellas...
text: Jimmy keeps his gun aimed. Having given Eli enough of a head
text: start. Every second more and more terrifying. Jimmy looks to

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: One last thing, Lyle. Milly sends
dialog: her love.

speaker_heading: MILLY

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I dunno -- ah -- you tell me?

text: Goes fishing into his pockets for the INHALER --
speaker_heading: MILLY

dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

dialog: We’re just gonna chill -- we're

text: coming back to him -- a surge of relief TEARS through Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: There he is. That’s my brother --
dialog: that’s my brother right there --
text: Jimmy plays back the emotion. He has to, as though all of

scene_heading: INT. THE MINESHAFT - NIGHT
text: We're BACK in the DECIMATED STRIP CLUB turned CRIME SCENE.
text: MARBLE-SIZED DEVICES float through the air. ACTIVATING and
text: ILLUMINATING the scorched space. They SWIRL overhead.
text: THE CLEANERS are here. Stepping forward into this rubble.
text: The marble-sized devices flutter like mechanical bees. The
text: two Cleaners fanning out, SCANNERS in hand --
text: Approaching the POOL TABLE wreckage --
text: -- and setting up THREE BATTERED NODES in formation around
text: it. A CLEANER punches a command into his SCANNER --
text: SHUNG. And the THREE NODES activate. GLOWING with life --
text: Before our eyes -- the POOL TABLE and rubble are scanned and
text: mapped. Waves of light fanning out, measuring...
text: Followed by the location where Eli stood when he pulled the
dialog: trigger -- the height and angle of the weapon when fired,
dialog: then...
text: FOOM. The open space before THE CLEANERS explodes with LIGHT.
text: As though LIT BY THE BLAST that came from THE WEAPON at the
text: exact moment when Eli pulled the trigger. A moment frozen.
text: We can see feint depictions of Milly, Jimmy, Lee, his cronies
dialog: right where they were the moment THE WEAPON was shot --
dialog: -- but the clearest face we can see is ELI. Closest to THE
text: WEAPON’S discharge. The contours of his face recognizable.
text: The CLEANERS wade closer to Eli. Passing right through the
text: holographic image, leaning down to stare him in the face.
text: Threatening. Taking in the image of Eli holding one of their
scene_heading: POSSESSIONS. And --
text: BOTH CLEANERS TURN FAST -- on alert -- able to sense or hear
dialog: something we can't.
dialog: 88.
text: Each reaches for back-mounted HOLSTERS. DRAWING WEAPONS

text: ON THE NEWS playing directly over Eli's shoulder. IS A PHOTO
text: OF ELI. Next to a clear mug-shot of Jimmy.
dialog: Wanted for involvement in robbery/murder investigation.

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - WOODEN NICKEL - AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/HOTEL ROOMS - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: ELI

text: Nothing is said. Jimmy wavers there, fists balled. Eyes
text: ringing. Stooped like a battered prizefighter out of rounds.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I didn't kill him, alright?
text: When Jimmy turns to face Eli, desperation is flashing.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You can think whatever you want’a

text: We can make out that this isn’t a vehicle. It’s THE CLEANERS.

text: -- and he stops. Looks up to see that he’s been spotted. BOTH
text: of THE CLEANERS are now STARING right back. The closest

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: HEY! What's going on!?
text: WITH ELI IN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE: No one’s able to see what’s

scene_heading: it RETURNS. Louder and Louder. BRBRBRBRBRAKAKAKAK --
text: Eli's petrified -- watching -- now MUZZLE FLASHES CRACKLE --
dialog: 105.
dialog: -- nearer. And NEARER. And FINALLY --
text: The YOUNG OFFICER STAGGERS back into view. Having been HIT
text: across his LEFT SIDE -- barely DODGING an ARC OF GUNFIRE as
text: it WEAVES past, chasing him into view. A clumsy dodge that

text: Eli, wide-eyed, watches the YOUNG OFFICER begin SCRAMBLING in
text: Eli’s direction -- SLAM. He COLLAPSES into the room. Color
text: draining as blood flows freely --
speaker_heading: YOUNG OFFICER
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Get -- g-get back behind the desk --
dialog: I’1l hold them --

dialog: My bag -- where is it?

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Sorry. Witnesses are a no can do.
text: BLAM -- Taylor GUNS down the YOUNG OFFICER.
text: Jimmy RECOILS in horror. Crabbing backwards. Color draining

text: Joni Mitchell's HELP ME. And it's nearing. Louder...
text: Until Taylor limps slowly into view on the other side of the

text: Jimmy doesn't say a word -- stays where he is...

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: -- I'll go away for good. You'll be

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You and me’1l always be brothers.
dialog: Like it or not. And I'll always be
dialog: there for you. Best as I can. Okay?

text: Nothing happens. Beat. His eyes still closed. Eli opens them.
text: Chances a look around.
dialog: 
text: Not dead. The explosion didn't even scratch Eli. He turns
text: FAST -- to JIMMY -- and goes wide eyed.
text: Jimmy's just a few feet away. But he’s suspended in mid-air.
text: The gravity that should be tethering him to the floor gone.
text: As though the blast has hurled Jimmy backward in super slow
dialog: motion --
text: Eli turns. The same can be said for the POLICE who just
text: kicked the door in -- there’s Morgan -- also nearly frozen --
text: Dust and debris flung by the blast hangs --
text: Time has frozen around Eli. He looks. Down at the exploded
text: grenade-like device at his feet. Spent. As though it's

text: small human boy in front of him. A David to Goliaths.
text: And the FIRST CLEANER steps forward. Weapon up.
text: Eli SWINGS the barrel of THE WEAPON at him. The TARGETING
text: system LOCKS ON -- the weapon's power surging warning...
text: «+. the Cleaner raises his hand in response.
text: A gesture of calm -- wait -- we see the Taller Cleaner’s hand
text: has five fingers. Reaching slowly to tap a small console on
dialog: his neck -- Eli watches --
text: AS THE TALLER CLEANER’S MECHANIZED HELMET RETRACTS.
text: To reveal the face of a human. A man. A transparent breathing
text: apparatus wraps along his cheek into his nostrils -- aiding
dialog: his breathing in our atmosphere.
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER
dialog: It's okay, son. Hang on, let's just
dialog: talk a minute, alright?
text: Eli's blanching at the sight of what's behind that mask --
text: maintains his grip on the weapon -- fingers CLAMPED --
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER
dialog: Look. We’re not here to hurt you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER (CONT'D)
dialog: But that weapon -- we need it back.
dialog: It doesn’t belong here --
text: Eli doesn’t waver -- gun still up. Overwhelmed, trembling.
text: Taking stock of the TALL CLEANER --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: And what -- what happens to me when
dialog: I give it to you?
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER
dialog: Look at your arm, Elijah.
text: Eli slows at the mention of his name...
text: Eli looks. This guy's pointing at Eli's scar.
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER
dialog: That's your activator. It’s the
dialog: reason you’re able to operate that
dialog: thing and no one else.
dialog: (then, cautiously)
dialog: Your parents made sure you got one
dialog: before you left, so that some day
dialog: you can return.
text: And Eli stops.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: My parents?
text: The Cleaner sees the emotion he's gotten from this kid. The
dialog: panic and the hope all at once --
text: A lot to take in. The Cleaner sees this, crosses closer.
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER
dialog: Your family have enemies -- the
dialog: ones who located you here, who
dialog: tracked you to that warehouse where
dialog: you'd been salvaging --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We reached them before they got to
dialog: you, but not quick enough apparently.
text: The Tall Cleaner extends his hand now for THE WEAPON.
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER
dialog: Time dispersals are only temporary,
text: and this one’s about to collapse.
dialog: Sir. I’m gonna need you to hand it
dialog: over now. We don't have long --
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: SECOND CLEANER
dialog: (in perfect Chinese)
dialog: Thirty seconds.
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER
dialog: (also in perfect Chinese)
dialog: This is important.
text: The Tall Cleaner motions. Eli turns, sees Jimmy -- still
text: suspended mid-air -- but we can now see the faint traces of
text: MOVEMENT accelerating -- same with Morgan and the POLICE --
text: Eli looks from the frozen forms of storming police -- down.
text: Studies THE WEAPON in his hand -- for the last time -- hands
text: it over. His eyes still swimming --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: But I don’t understand -- am I
dialog: human?
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER
dialog: 100%. And from Earth. Just not this
dialog: version.
text: The SECOND CLEANER steps forward -- takes the weapon, snaps
text: it MAGNETICALLY onto his back --
speaker_heading: SECOND CLEANER
dialog: We gotta move.
text: The Tall Cleaner nods. Eyes Eli -- he can't just leave him
text: with that. So the Tall Cleaner acquiesces --
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER
dialog: We are at war, Elijah. An all too
dialog: violent war that threatens more
dialog: than you can imagine. And you're
dialog: too important to be caught up in it
dialog: right now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But just because you’re lonely, it
dialog: doesn’t mean that you’re alone. You
dialog: will see your parents again.
dialog: They're counting on it.
dialog: Then. Fateful.
speaker_heading: SECOND CLEANER
dialog: And then you'll be giving us
dialog: orders.
text: The Cleaner offers his hand. A soldier's hand.
dialog: 117.
text: Eli accepts. Head-spun. Shakes it. The Tall Cleaner grins,
text: rises. Falls in with the SECOND --
text: -- who draws what looks like a MECHANIZED BATON -- ACTIVATES
text: it. The BATON SURGES. CRACKLING with LIGHT --
text: Eli RECOILS, watches -- sees his BREATH BEGIN TO FOG, the
text: TEMPERATURE here dropping. FROST -- just like before --
text: GROWS in crystalline formations across every surface, the
dialog: ceiling and floor --
text: -- slivers of tiny snow, condensation in the air freezing --
text: begin to fall -- leading Eli's gaze to JIMMY. Still flying
text: backwards in ultra slow-mo but now quickly ACCELERATING --
text: The SECOND CLEANER WEAVES the baton through the air as though
text: TRACING A DOORWAY -- the TALL CLEANER locks eyes with Eli...
speaker_heading: TALL CLEANER
dialog: Be seeing you.
text: And what can only be described as a HOLE TORN OUT OF THIN AIR
text: ERUPTS INTO EXISTENCE. Unreal. A doorway to another world --
text: The Cleaners step through -- the DOORWAY COLLAPSES behind
text: them. LIKE THAT -- they’re gone. And time rights itself.
text: Jimmy SMACKS the floor, YELPS -- POLICE BREAK IN -- from
text: EVERY ANGLE -- immediately and overwhelming --
dialog: YELLING ORDERS. Get down -- etc, etc --
text: Jimmy, on the floor, hands in the air -- yells back that he
text: and Eli are UNARMED. Eli’s knocked HARD to the ground. CUFFED.
text: PULLING BACK. From Eli’s view -- everything changed.
text: Morgan stands in view. Takes in the insanity of this scene.
dialog: The frost -- the carnage --
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Clear the building! MOVE!
text: -- and Eli at the center. No Cleaners. No weapon. Gone.
scene_heading: EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Eli sits in the back of an AMBULANCE. The scene of the
dialog: shootout A FLURRY of ACTIVITY now --
text: -- every face betraying shock. Eli watches until --
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: MORGAN (0.C.)
dialog: I found the statement you were
dialog: giving inside.
text: Eli looks up briefly to see Morgan standing nearby.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Your brother seems to be matching
dialog: it blow for blow.
text: Morgan nods across the lot where Jimmy speaks to LOCAL COPS --
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: With the exception of a few things.
text: Eli remains silent. Still in shock --
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I'd say he’s covering for you.
text: Morgan looks to Eli. He looks up at her. Contemplates that.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Which... I might just advise you to
dialog: let him do, given you’re a minor
dialog: and you've got your whole life
dialog: ahead of you.
dialog: 
text: Eli slows. Digests that. Looks off to Jimmy --
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: What's gonna happen to my brother?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: He’s gonna go away for a while.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But if he keeps cooperating -- it
dialog: might not be for as long as he
dialog: thinks.
text: Morgan holds. Looks at Eli a little more dire now --
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: As an incident on public record,
dialog: you've managed to raise some eye-
text: brows. Crazy looking weapons and
text: men in armored suits vanishing into
dialog: thin air... there are people who’re
dialog: gonna want to talk to you.
text: Eli remains quiet.
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: But we can go over that later. For
dialog: now, just sit tight --
text: Eli holds on this -- eyes Morgan as she rises, moves off. Eli
text: watches her go. And then sees --
text: -- Jimmy, still cuffed, is HOISTED to his feet. Lead away by
text: a detail of uniformed POLICE.
text: Jimmy and Eli catch each other's eye. Jimmy nods. Juts his
text: chin as he goes. Still Jimmy.
text: As he’s loaded into a CRUISER, Eli catches Jimmy's gaze,
text: standing there -- ELI offers up that now-familiar all good
text: wink. Jimmy, across the lot -- grins WIDE, sends it back...
speaker_heading: ELI (V.0.)
dialog: You don't get to choose family.
scene_heading: INT. BACK OF THE CRUISER - MOVING AWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Jimmy, with his wrists still cuffed -- raises them into a
text: little wave -- watches his little brother's figure recede
text: into the faraway distance behind him --
speaker_heading: ELI (V.0.)
dialog: You don’t. Just cause someone is,
dialog: it doesn’t mean they can’t hurt
dialog: you. Doesn’t mean they won't.
scene_heading: EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Eli looks -- out through the crowded lot -- just out.
speaker_heading: ELI (V.0.)
dialog: All you can do when it comes to the
dialog: people you love is brace yourself.
text: Across the face of the world he can see beyond. Our world.
text: Eyes traversing its contours as though feeling for what's
text: beyond. For who. A light wind picks up.
speaker_heading: _ ELI (V.0.)
dialog: That's just how it is.
text: And Eli holds... and we CUT TO BLACK.
dialog:
