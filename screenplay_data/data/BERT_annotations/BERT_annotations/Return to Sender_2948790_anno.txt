speaker_heading: A WHITE SCREEN
text: We sense this is someone's P.O.V. The WHITE slowly disperses as hints
text: of BLUE SKY peek through. We are DESCENDING through the CLOUDS as the
text: evening sunset weaves a blanket of orange and red hues over a LARGE CITY
text: which slowly comes INTO FOCUS.
text: Floating HIGH ABOVE the peaks and valleys of CHICAGO'S SKYLINE, as if
text: being mysteriously moved to a letter on a Ouija Board, WE ARE DRAWN to
text: an unfinished STEEL-FRAMED SKYSCRAPER. The hum of the construction work
text: below fills our ears. Gradually, WE CLOSE IN on a small yellow dot that
text: dances on one of the exposed beams... CLOSER STILL... Just as the
text: detailed creases of a yellow hard hat become evident, it tilts OUT OF
text: FRAME as the face of the MAN wearing it looks up into the sky.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's a shame we have to put roofs on 'em.
text: This is Bob, BOB RUELAND; late thirties, a confident, handsome man, with
text: a magnetic personality. He walks along the high beams with ease as he

speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)
dialog: (yells to guy on lower beam)
dialog: It's looking good, Mike. I'm outta here...

scene_heading: INT. PRIMATE HOUSE
text: A young woman wearing a lab coat exits a side door of the glass enclosed
dialog: structure. This is DR. KATHERINE RUELAND, early thirties, smart, regal,
text: perfect-posture-pretty. Securing the lock on the door behind her, she

dialog: Hey, Sidney...
dialog: (back to Katherine)
dialog: I need your signature to change the Polar's diet...

dialog: And it's already five, I'll check in on the calf. You go home and get

speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Oh, thanks Chuck.
dialog: (thinking out loud)
dialog: Bob's picking up my dress... I have stockings... I have to take Mel to

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: See what this lady does for you, Sidney?
text: Katherine laughs and presses her hand against the glass. Sydney returns
text: the gesture, pressing his palm against hers.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Look at him Charlie, we'd go nuts in a place this small...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know... But we're getting there.
dialog: (friendly pat on the back)
dialog: Pour on the guilt during your speech...
text: Charlie opens the door for Katherine as they walk out of the building.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: I intend to. Who're you bringing tonight?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Haven't decided yet. Still got two hours.
text: The door closes behind them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A door opens into...
scene_heading: INT. BOB AND KATHERINE'S APARTMENT
text: An upscale old fashioned brownstone, with large rooms and hardwood
text: floors. Scattered antique rugs...classy but comfortable.
text: Bob enters with their dog, "MEL", a yellow lab, unhooks the dog's leash
text: and slips out of his wet trench coat. He's perfectly handsome in his
text: tuxedo. Grabbing an old towel from the hat stand, he dries off Mel.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (walking to the kitchen)
dialog: I know you're hungry...
text: Mel follows Bob half way down the hall then turns back and sits at the
text: front door. Bob leans back into the hall, watching Mel...
speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)
dialog: She'll be home any minute.
text: We hear an ELECTRIC CAN OPENER... Mel looks towards the kitchen -- but
text: he waits for Katherine. We hear a SET OF KEYS in the door. Mel's tail
text: starts a-wagging. Katherine enters, Mel whimpers with delight.
text: Katherine immediately bends down to greet him.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: (dog talk)
dialog: Hi, my baby, you're such a good boy.
dialog: (Mel kisses her face)
dialog: Oh, I know, I love you too.
speaker_heading: BOB (O.C)
dialog: Hey, Babe.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Hey, honey. It's pouring out. You get my dress?
text: Bob comes down the hall out of the kitchen. Katherine is taking off her
dialog: shoes.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yep, and I took Mel out.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: In your Tux?
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Your pant legs are soaked.
text: Bob disappears into the bathroom off the hall.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah.
text: (he leans back with a blow dryer aimed at his ankles)
dialog: Tell Mel to eat.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: (dog's right next to her)
dialog: Mel honey, eat.
text: Mel immediately heads for the kitchen. Katherine walks up to Bob,
text: watching him blow drying his pant legs. She grabs his face and kisses
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE (cont'd)
dialog: You're cute.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You spend all day with an Ape, what do you expect?
text: Katherine smacks him on the butt.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: A BLACK SCREEN
text: We hear the sound of a SLIDE PROJECTOR. CLICK-CLICK.
speaker_heading: UP ON:
text: A SLIDE of a large GORILLA, eating a dish of pasta with his hands, FILLS
speaker_heading: THE SCREEN.
text: We hear polite laughter, from a large group of people. KATHERINE'S
text: VOICE, speaks softly into a microphone...
speaker_heading: KATHERINE (V.O.)
dialog: As you can see in this photo of Sydney, he is sometimes "too much" like
dialog: man.
text: More laughter. PULL OUT to reveal we are at...
scene_heading: INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: A black tie affair in full swing. The annual "ARTS DINNER" (Animal's
dialog: Right to Survive) has once again attracted Chicago's "upper crust" and
text: young hopefuls.
text: CLICK-CLICK. Another SLIDE, FILLS THE SCREEN. This time, it is of
scene_heading: SYDNEY and BOB RUELAND.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE (V.O.)
dialog: Over the last ten years, Sydney has become part of the family. Here,
dialog: he's showing his flash cards to my husband. My husband is the one on
dialog: the left.
dialog: Even more laughter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE AUDIENCE
text: BOB smiles at those around him. One GENTLEMAN teasingly pats him on
text: the back. Bob looks up at the stage to his wife, with a playful "thanks
dialog: a lot" look.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: KATHERINE, minus the lab coat, in a lovely black evening dress, smiles
text: affectionately at Bob. She CLICKS on the next SLIDE.
text: On the large screen next to her, we now see a photograph showing the
text: small area that Sydney is forced to live in.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE
dialog: Tonight, I was hoping I'd be able to announce that we've reached our
dialog: financial goals for the expansion we so desperately need, but
dialog: unfortunately, we were not awarded the grant.
text: A murmur of disgust and disappointment from the crowd.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE (cont'd)
dialog: But with one more year of fund raising, along with the money we've
dialog: raised here tonight, Lincoln Park Zoo will soon be able to expand the
dialog: Primate House to triple its size.
dialog: Applause.
speaker_heading: KATHERINE (cont'd)
dialog: And I assure you, my dear friend Sydney and his family are very excited
dialog: for construction to begin.
text: Katherine CLICKS another SLIDE up onto the screen; SYDNEY and a group of
text: GORILLAS, all wearing hard hats.
text: Laughter from the crowd mixed with a sympathetic "ahhh".
speaker_heading: KATHERINE (cont'd)
dialog: Thank you all for your tremendous support. Enjoy the evening.
text: Katherine receives a generous round of applause as she leaves the stage.
text: The last slide of Sydney still shines on the swaying screen.
text: A CONDUCTOR/M.C. steps up to the microphone.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Thank you, Dr. Rueland. Now ladies and gentlemen, tonight's very
dialog: special guest, Mr. Tony Bennett!!!
text: APPLAUSE. TONY BENNETT steps out onto the stage...
speaker_heading: TONY BENNETT
dialog: Thank you very much. I'm thrilled to be here tonight. It's an honor to
dialog: be a part of such a noble effort on behalf of the animals.
dialog: (indicates the band)

text: A YOUNG WOMAN lies in bed. A well cared for plant blooms on the night
text: stand, behind it, a small easel holds a half finished watercolor.
dialog: Posters of famous European cities decorate the walls. We get the sense
dialog: this room has been her home for a month or so.
text: The patient is GRACE BRIGGS, late twenties. An attractive, shy and frail
dialog: woman.
text: Grace barely responds as her best friend, MEGAN DAYTON, seated in the
text: chair next to the bed, reads a Cosmo quiz aloud from the magazine.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Is it most important that a man is, A: Polite to your family and
dialog: friends? B: Can handle finances well? Or C: Will take care of you when
dialog: you are ill? Well, I guess your answer is definitely C.
text: Megan checks a box. Grace smiles.
speaker_heading: MEGAN (cont'd)
dialog: What do you expect most from a relationship? A: Companionship? B: Sex?
dialog: C: Respect? I'd have to go with B, sex. But let's mark "C" so we get a
dialog: higher score. This is pathetic, I'm cheating on a magazine quiz.
text: Grace stirs a little. Megan immediately gets up and leans over the bed
dialog: to hear anything Grace may say.
speaker_heading: MEGAN (cont'd)
dialog: What? What is it? What d'ya need? Your back? Move the pillow? Your
dialog: neck?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Rosebud.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Very funny.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I just want some water.
text: Megan holds a paper cup of water and bends the straw to Grace's mouth.
text: We see the great amount of effort it takes for Grace to drink the water.
speaker_heading: GRACE (cont'd)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Would you like me to bring the check or will you be ordering dessert?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Megan, you can go home, y'a know.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: To what? I don't have cable, you do.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What about Joe and the kids?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: He likes me more when I'm not around. And the kids like me a lot more
text: after they've been alone with Joe.
dialog: (smoothing Grace's blankets)
dialog: It's good for him to be with the kids when they're coming down from the
dialog: sugar. He usually fuels 'em up and then they go through de-tox on my
dialog: shift.
text: DR. SENDERAK, enters and very business like, opens Grace's chart.
speaker_heading: DR. SENDERAK
dialog: Ladies...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Hey, Dr. Senderak.
text: The Doctor goes to switch places with Megan, who moves out of the way,
dialog: careful not to knock into any of the I.V. stands or monitors; they've
dialog: done this dance a million times.
speaker_heading: DR. SENDERAK
dialog: (scanning Grace's chart)
dialog: You're about the same, hematocrit 16, SMA 20... Some things are a bit
dialog: low but that's to be expected. We're entering borrowed time. The most
dialog: important thing now Grace is rest, you need to rest.
dialog: (putting chart under his arm)
dialog: I'll see you tomorrow.
text: As the doctor exits...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Doctor, why don't you give her your heart? You're not using it.
speaker_heading: DR. SENDERAK
dialog: Good evening, ladies.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (scolding)
dialog: Megan.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: What? I wish he'd do...something.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: He can't. Even if a heart's available, they won't give it to me. I
dialog: just have my Grandpa pressuring them. I have no husband, no children.
dialog: I may never get a heart.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Listen, Tin Man. You've got me. I'm pressuring them.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Thanks, Meg.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (fixing bed sheets)
dialog: You'll get a new heart and before you know it, you'll be back in your
dialog: garden, you'll be painting... You'll be getting asked out by the most
dialog: fantastic men...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm getting a new heart, not a new ass.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: My point is, you'll be out doing things you were never able to do,
dialog: riding a bike...
dialog: (looks at the posters)
dialog: Traveling, painting in Europe...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's too late, Megan. I'm too old. I'm twenty-seven. My mother's
dialog: heart gave up by twenty-five. I've been sick too long...
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Promise me you'll take care of my grandpa...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Twenty-seven is not old. I'm thirty-three...four...five -- whatever.

dialog: Oh, hi Mr. Bennington, I didn't see you or I would have stopped and said
dialog: hello.
speaker_heading: MR. BENNINGTON
dialog: Katherine's speech was wonderful. I suppose she told you about the

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't have any...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have ruined the surprise.

speaker_heading: ANGELO

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I already took me mittens off!

speaker_heading: MARTY (cont'd)
dialog: I do this and you get me three Chicken Vesuvio's.
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: I already served 'em.
text: A PHONE rings. It's tone is different. Both men FREEZE. They look at
text: the one phone, none of the lines are lit.
text: In unison, their heads immediately turn to this other PHONE. This phone
text: has no dial on it. A piece of aluminum foil, cut out in the shape of a
text: heart is taped above it. They stare at it, half expecting it to shake
text: when it rings.
text: Marty drops the plates of capellini; the pomodoro sauce splashes up on
text: to his apron. He attempts to run to the phone, but the sauce has made
text: the floor slippery. Angelo grabs Marty's arm and they both "skate" to
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Grace. Oh my soul! I'm on me way!
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: (like a kid)

speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: MARTY (cont'd)
dialog: I forgot to press the button.
text: He steps back in. The doors close. A beat. They open. Marty steps

speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BOB

dialog: Oh, yeah...
text: Bob, still on "auto-pilot" walks into the kitchen. He fills the dog

text: stop at a note on the fridge. It reads: "BOB, HONEY, PLEASE PICK UP MY
text: BLACK DRESS AT THE CLEANERS. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE YOU, K."
text: Bob takes the note in his hand, runs his fingers over her writing, then

dialog: Should he stay? Should he go?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm going to stay.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, please, go home. I really just need to be alone.
text: A painful silence. Two grown men, being as stoic as humanly possible.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Bob, I don't know what to say.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: I'll pick your parents up at the airport in the morning.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Call if you need me. I'm here in two minutes.
text: Charlie leaves, closing the door behind him. Bob walks over and flips

text: stops--turns, and goes back to the front door. He wags his tail slowly.
speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)

speaker_heading: EMMETT

speaker_heading: EMMETT

text: stick out of her pocket, she conceals the top portion of the long scar

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Bob, you have to slow down. You're working too hard.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (sick of hearing it)
dialog: Yeah, well... Whatever. You should quit smoking.
speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: I have. Several times.

speaker_heading: SUIT #1
dialog: We'd like to use that fifty feet for a souvenir shop...

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, definitely...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Because I seriously doubt the gorillas would even know how to sell the

speaker_heading: SUIT #2
dialog: Okay Bob, you've made your point. But we've given in on enough...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (taking control)
dialog: Guys here's the deal. My wife wanted this building up two years ago.
dialog: So the way I look at it, we're already behind schedule. You give me

speaker_heading: SUIT #2

dialog: stop running, why bother, Bob has forgotten he has teammates.
text: Bob drives through the key and past a few members of the other team,

speaker_heading: the ALE HOUSE.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Nope...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Just have a beer with the guys once, don't worry, none of them will talk
dialog: to you, they all think you're nuts...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're sure you won't have some women "accidentally" joining us.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I did that once...twice. But I won't tonight, because Friday night, I
dialog: have someone very special...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (waving his hand)
dialog: Forget it, Chuck.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She has a great body. An attorney. Great body, very attractive, great
dialog: body... I'd date her myself but I was with her sister once...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Uh-huh...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: You'll like her. She loves animals, her cat is a patient of mine.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (watches Bob ignore him)
dialog: Oh that's nice, just walk away, go ahead, run away...
dialog: (yells)
dialog: I'm your only friend--you know that? I'm trying to help you...
text: Bob deliberately walks back to Charlie...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (controlled, but angry)
dialog: You want to help me, Charlie--stop trying to 'help' me... Let me at
dialog: least enjoy my heartache...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What kind of twisted argument is that?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: And stop being such a jerk at the zoo.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (totally confused)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don't just stand around, speak up. Initiate something. Fight one of
dialog: the battles. You want to help me, Charlie? Then help me get it
dialog: done--for Katherine.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Then what?

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BOB'S APARTMENT - LATER SAME EVENING
text: A teenage boy, wearing roller blades, negotiates the steps. He's coming
text: down very slowly backwards, hanging onto the cement stoop for balance.
text: This is DANNY, the dog walker. Unbeknownst to Danny, Bob, carrying his
text: gym bag and a small scale model of Sydney's new home, walks up behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (noticing the blades)
dialog: Danny, you got 'em.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (turns to quickly)
dialog: Oh, geeze...
text: (turns back, clinging to the stoop)
dialog: Yeah. I just took Mel out.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thanks Pal. How's your math coming?
text: Danny lives right next door, he climbs over the front stoop to his
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Great, got a "C" on my last test.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Alright!
dialog: (they do a high five over the stoop)
dialog: I'll give you a raise if you can get it to a "B".
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: "C" plus?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Deal.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: The apartment, now lacking the "woman's touch", is unkempt and
text: disorganized. Mel is sleeping against the front door, barely budging
text: when Bob pushes the door open. Mel just kind of slides with it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hey, Mel, any calls?
text: Bob picks up his scattered mail beneath the mail slot. He casually
text: tosses the mail next to the phone, then sits at the coffee table turning
text: the model from side to side viewing it from each angle...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (to Mel)
dialog: Ya hungry?
text: Bob walks down the hall to the kitchen. Mel following half way then
text: turns and goes back to his "waiting" spot at the front door. Bob
text: watches him, sighs...
scene_heading: DOORBELL RINGS.
text: Bob answers the door. A young DELIVERY GIRL stands holding a white bag

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (grabbing Mel's collar)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (handing her the cash)
dialog: Here y'go...
speaker_heading: DELIVERY GIRL
dialog: Thanks, Mr. Rueland. See ya tomorrow night.
dialog: (to Mel, still barking)
dialog: Bye, bye, Mel.
text: Bob closes the door and carries the food into the kitchen. He removes

dialog: plate.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: Mel has gone to his usual "waiting for Katherine" spot at the door. WE
text: STAY on Mel.
speaker_heading: BOB (O.C.)
dialog: C'mon Mel.
text: Nothing. Mel doesn't move.
speaker_heading: BOB (O.C.) (cont'd)
dialog: Mel, let's go. I gotcha some rice.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Mel!
text: Bob leans into the hall. Looks at Mel.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: God damn it.
text: He starts walking towards Mel.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: C'mon Mel, stop it. She's gone.
dialog: (kneels down)
dialog: You can't sit here night after night. C'mon get up... Do you think
dialog: that's what she would have wanted? C'mon, get up Mel... Look at you...
text: (Bob sees his own reflection in the glass on the door)
dialog: Look at you...
text: (He slowly slumps down)
text: Time seems to stand still as WE STAY on Bob sitting next to Mel. He
text: sits, staring out, looking at nothing. We see a million memories flash
text: by in his eyes...
text: Suddenly, he gets up and walks directly to the phone. Dials.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Charlie. I'll go on Friday night. Yeah, you heard me. Where is it?
text: He takes an envelope near the phone. He palms it, to write on the back.
text: We see the front and the return address reads: DONOR LIAISON OF SAINT
speaker_heading: MARY'S...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: O'Rielly's "Italian" Restaurant? Uh-huh. Yeah, me too.

speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: It's a busy, no? I love Fridays.
text: Marty walks by, deliberately setting a plate down in front of Grace.
text: Angelo looks on...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Here's some leftovers for y'lassy...
text: Grace looks down at an airline envelope sitting on the plate... She
text: opens it. We see AIR ITALIA printed on the side... Grace gasps.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No way...Grandpa!
dialog: (hugs him)
dialog: Rome!
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (not great with affection)
dialog: Ah, save that for the Italians... I know you love me.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh my, Grandpa, you do too much...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Angelo says a true artist must pain in the Pizza Navona...
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: "Piazza" Navona...Marone.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Grandpa, you have to come with me...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You go for both of us. Instead of postcards, you send me paintings.
text: Sophie enters, picks up a small slab of Parmesan cheese... She sees the
text: ticket in Grace's hand.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: You couldn't wait till I was in the kitchen?
speaker_heading: MARTY
text: Her face still has the same expression as when she opened it... See?
text: Grace's still beaming, looking at the ticket...
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I miss everything...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Grandpa, I'm so happy to be right here. I never imagined... I think
dialog: I'll go in the fall...
text: Marty, getting a little choked up, picks up two plates and walks back
text: towards the dining room.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Okay, Sophie, back to work.
text: Sophie ignores him and walks to Grace, Parmesan in hand...
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Can I see it?
text: Grace holds the ticket up in front of Sophie's eyes.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE (cont'd)
dialog: It's beautiful. You deserve it, sweetie.
text: Sophie exits.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Angelo, thank you.
dialog: (putting the ticket safely in her apron pocket)
dialog: Wait till I tell Megan...
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: One more surprise, "he" is here.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Who-He?
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: The guy I tell you about. He's at the bar waiting to meet you.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (oh, no...)
dialog: Angelo...
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: It's okay, I tell him you had you chest worked on...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Angelo, please...my "chest worked on?" He's going to expect...
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Whatever... You don't have to--
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: This guy is different. He's just like you. He have a transplant.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CLOSE-UP, GRACE'S FACE,
speaker_heading: MAN (O.C.)
dialog: So, I'm still in a little pain, but you know how that is...
text: Grace politely shakes her head "yes".
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: GRACE'S P.O.V.
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP, MAN'S FOREHEAD,
text: It's obvious he's had a transplant. A hair transplant.
text: PULL OUT to a TWO SHOT of Grace and the Man at the bar...
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: My doctors say it's a solid transplant.
dialog: (points to head)
dialog: Go ahead, pull it.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No, that's okay.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: C'mon, giver 'er a tug.
text: In the b.g., we notice Charlie and TWO WOMEN enter the dining room.
text: Marty politely takes their jackets and hangs them on the hooks in the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. O'RIELLY'S - WELLS STREET
text: Bob's white pick-up comes up the street, he slows down directly in front
dialog: of O'Rielly's...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S TRUCK.
text: He checks the name of the restaurant he'd written on the envelope and
text: notices the letter's return address...DONORS LIAISON OF ST. MARY'S. Bob
text: slowly opens the envelope and takes out an enclosed form letter. He
text: reads it, then reaches into the envelope and pulls out a WORN PALE PINK
speaker_heading: LETTER.
speaker_heading: VALET GUY
dialog: You staying or leaving or what?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Huh? Um, staying...
text: Bob quickly tucks the pink envelope back into his jacket pocket and hops

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. O'RIELLY'S - CONTINUOUS
text: Bob hangs his coat on a hook. Charlie spots Bob and waves him over.

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (looking at this guy)
dialog: Grace, we have a new four top.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm right on it.
dialog: (to the man)
dialog: Nice meeting you.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Likewise, I'm sure.
text: Grace asks the BARTENDER to prepare four waters, then leaves to pick up a
text: tray in the kitchen...passing Bob and Charlie's table, we STAY with
dialog: them...
text: Everyone's getting settled. Charlie and his date, SHARI, can't seem to
text: talk without touching. Bob, meanwhile, sites beside MARSHA, an
text: attractive woman--great body. As she takes off her suit jacket, we see
text: her shirt is one size too small for her breasts. She's smart, pretty,
dialog: but ohmigod, shut-up...
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: I said it's Squeaker, my kitty. Well, as you can imagine, everyone
dialog: laughed... That's when I met Charlie, he was the only Vet open... Are
dialog: they bringing menus? Anyway, Squeaker won't let another Vet touch him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, well I don't want to hear about anyone else touching your
dialog: Squeaker.
text: Charlie winks. The ladies laugh. Bob's in hell.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Everything's good here.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Nice place, Chuck.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: It's okay... Small.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's family run. Great food.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: I went to a little place in Spain once that looked just like this except
dialog: it was a glove store.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Hm-mmm. So Rob, Charlie tells me you're an engineer.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He's a structural engineer. You know that new building on State Street,
dialog: that's Bob's.
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: You own it?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, I designed it.
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh.
text: Grace arrives at the table and begins setting the waters down in front of
text: each person. Bob notices her, really notices her. When Grace gets to
dialog: Marsha...
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: (puts her hand out to stop the glass)
dialog: No, no, no... Do you have bottled water?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yes, of course. Anyone else?
text: Bob stares at Grace, he speaks before he knows it...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Excuse me, do I know you?
text: They stare at each other. Everyone at the table gets a bit
dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I think so... You've been here before.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No. I'd remember an Irish Italian restaurant.
text: Grace laughs. Marsha doesn't.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Whatever... Water, I just don't want Swiss. I got sick on imported
dialog: Swiss water once. As long as it's not Swiss or tap water, it'll be
dialog: fine. Preferably, French.
dialog: (using her fingers to emphasize)
dialog: I'd like it cold, no ice, no glass, just the bottle and a straw.
dialog: (leaning forward)
dialog: You want to write it down?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm pretty sure I have it. Anyone else?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (oh God)
dialog: No, thank you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A wine list please.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Sure.
text: Just as Grace's about to walk away, Bob reaches out to stop her; gently
text: touching her arm... There's a feeling between them. Neither one quite
dialog: understands it... It's just a hint of warmth.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Excuse me, could I have a coffee? No straw.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Sure.
text: Bob watches her go, his glance interrupted by his RINGING cell phone.
text: Everyone at the table goes for their phone. The only one who doesn't is
dialog: Bob, and it's his phone.
text: Another RING. Marsha, Charlie and Shari stare at Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What?
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh, I usually don't bring it...
dialog: (flips open phone)
dialog: Excuse me.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Rueland... Hey Mike... Uh-huh
text: Bob stands, motioning to the table that he'll be right back. He talks
text: and walks which takes him to the
text: BACK OF THE RESTAURANT.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'm glad... So let's call in a favor on Hank...the brick layer. We'll
dialog: contract them for five days, they'll do four for me, then one day at the
dialog: zoo. Either way, they get paid for five like under the original
dialog: contract... Who else is on the clock?
text: Bob leans against the back wall and listens to Mike rattling off names
text: on the other end of the phone... We notice Bob's eyes are interested in
dialog: someone.
speaker_heading: BOB'S P.O.V.
text: Grace is emptying a bottle of Evian water into a sink and refilling it
text: from the tap. As she goes to replace the cap, her eyes meet Bob's...
text: She's embarrassed, she's been caught. Bob winks his approval. They
text: share a smile. This is the first time we see Bob truly smile again.
speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yeah, yeah, I'm still here... That sounds great.
text: Grace leaves for the dining room.
speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'll talk to you in the morning then...Wait, Mike? Do me a favor, call
dialog: me back in about five or ten minutes and just ignore what I say...
dialog: Thanks.
text: Bob closes the phone and returns to the
speaker_heading: DINING ROOM
text: as Grace arrives at the table with menus. Bob sits as Marsha takes a big
dialog: sip of water...
speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)
dialog: (to Marsh)
dialog: I bet that's refreshing.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Such a difference...
text: He glances up at Grace, she's biting her lip...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: We have some wonderful specials this evening; a lovely Chicken
dialog: Vesuvio...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Please, I'm around them all day.
text: Shari laughs, then kisses Charlie way too much. Bob doesn't take his
text: eyes off Grace.
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: A corn beef and cabbage souffle and a spinach ravioli in an arrabiatta
dialog: sauce, it's my favorite.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'll have that...
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: Okay, and a sword fish, served with white wine sauce and tomato and
dialog: garlic checca...
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: I'll have veal.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: We don't serve veal.
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Oh, brother...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Just get something else...
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: Charlie, you order for me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Grace)
dialog: We'll need another minute.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (to Grace)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Sure, take your time...
text: Grace walks away... In the b.g. we see her pass Marty, whose stopping
text: and checking on a few tables like a good host should. A few PATRONS
text: offer their compliments as he walks towards the kitchen...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Grazi. Grazi.
dialog: (yelling to the kitchen)
dialog: Angelo! We need...
text: Marty disappears behind the swinging doors...
speaker_heading: MARTY (O.C.)
dialog: Three more Shepard pies!
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: An Italian restaurant that doesn't serve veal...
text: Bob's cell phone RINGS. This time he pounces on it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Rueland... Yeah, Mike? Uh-huh... Well, I'll leave right now. Be
dialog: there in five minutes... No, it's not a problem, if I have to be there,
dialog: I have to be there.
text: Bob flips his phone closed.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The Wabash building.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tonight: They're working on a Friday night?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh yeah... I'm so sorry Marsha, really very sorry. It was nice meeting
dialog: you, and Shari... Please, enjoy your meal and...again, I apologize. If
dialog: you'll excuse me.
text: Bob stands, pushes in his chair and bee-lines for the exit...As he
text: leaves he puts his cell phone down on the bar to grab his coat off the
text: hook, he glances around one last time for Grace, she walks up behind
dialog: him...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Everything okay?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, hi, yes, fine. I just got called to work...
text: Bob puts on his coat and taps the letter in the breast pocket, still
dialog: there...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What about your wife?...and her friends, will they be staying--
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: She's not my wife...not a friend, not an acquaintance, and yes, they'll
dialog: be staying...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Oh...
text: Sophie walks up with a "to go" order all bagged and ready "to go". Grace
dialog: stops her...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Soph? What is that?
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Ravioli... Chicken Vesuvio and a side of cabbage...for pick up.
text: Grace takes the bag from Sophie.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (to Bob)
dialog: Here it is...
dialog: (reads receipt)
dialog: Mr. Ahtsuki. Sorry for the wait... Since it took so long, it's on the
dialog: house. Come back again...
text: Grace smiles warmly, then confidently turns and walks straight into a
dialog: table. Oops.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. O'RIELLY'S
text: Bob exhales and hands his ticket to the valet, as Charlie steps up
text: behind him...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Bob, what's the deal?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I came out didn't I?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, congratulations... You lasted almost a half an hour... That's a
dialog: record...
dialog: (glances back to Marsha)
dialog: I only met her a couple of times, I had no idea she was so..."not
dialog: you"...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's fine, Chuck. It's not her, it's me... She's everything you said
dialog: she was, an attorney with a great body.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: C'mon, you're already out, it's Friday night, have some wine... Okay,
dialog: have a lot of wine and enjoy the company...
text: The valet pulls up with Bob's truck...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (walks to his truck)
dialog: I can't. If I could I would... But I've gotta go to work.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (yells)
dialog: I know you're going home...
text: The VERY SHORT VALET GUY jumps out of the driver's seat. Bob climbs in

text: his seat. As he drives off, in the b.g., we see a MAN arguing with the
dialog: valet.
speaker_heading: MR. AHTSUKI
dialog: I no need to park. I just pick up order. One minute. Give me my keys,
dialog: I be one minute...
text: Charlie walks back into the restaurant.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LINCOLN PARK ZOO - BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: The rain has stopped. Bob, lost in thought, leans on the stone railing
text: that lines the gleaming wet path on the bridge, eating his ravioli out
text: of the styrofoam container with a plastic fork. He taps his breast
text: pocket for the letter, still there. He slowly takes it half way out,
text: then puts it back. He finishes eating... Stops, breathes in the night
text: air. Leaning on the rail, he looks out over the river and up at the
dialog: Chicago sky line.
text: He feels the letter in his chest pocket, reaches into the jacket and
text: pulls out the worn pale pink envelope...
text: He carefully opens it...
speaker_heading: CLOSE-UP BOB.
text: As he reads, his face reflects the emotional content of the letter...
scene_heading: OVER BOB'S SHOULDER,
text: we see the feminine hand writing...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE INTO:
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP OF GRACE'S HAND,
dialog: as she writes...
dialog: "I hope this letter will bring some comfort..."
text: PULL BACK, revealing Grace in her hospital bed, just weeks after the
text: transplant. She is sitting up, thoughtfully composing the letter on her
text: bedside table as little Bridgette lies beside her coloring. Megan is
text: busy adding water to the flowers on the nightstand.
text: The door opens and a NURSE enters the room. Grace immediately pulls the
text: blanket over to hide Bridgette who continues to color beneath the blanket
text: as the nurse takes Grace's blood pressure. The nurse finishes and exits,
text: Bridgette pops out from under the blanket. Grace continues writing...
scene_heading: CLOSE-UP OF GRACE'S HAND,
dialog: as she writes the following...
dialog: "...your thoughtfulness in a moment of such deep sorrow..."
speaker_heading: BACK ON BOB,
dialog: "...I awake each day feeling the gentle rhythm of the heart that beats
dialog: inside me..."

speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: UP ON:
scene_heading: EXT. LINCOLN PARK ZOO - NEXT DAY
text: We notice that scaffolding has been set up around TWO OAK TREES. Bob

speaker_heading: JEFF

dialog: Bob, I know on this most recent set...
dialog: (afraid of setting him off)

dialog: I have a different set of prints in the office.

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No.

text: shoulders...as they walk and talk...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: My Uncle Al always had a cigar going... And in his other hand he carried
dialog: a bean bag ash tray, red plaid...he'd love to drive down alleys and pick
dialog: up other people's junk. I was his spotter. My mother would get so mad.
dialog: But without fail, come her birthday, Uncle Al would make some great lamp
dialog: or table out of the lumber and stuff we collected. She loved everything
dialog: he ever made... But every time he collected stuff, they'd have the same
dialog: argument... "Don't bring that junk in my house!" "It's not junk!" Well,
dialog: anyway, I've loved building things ever since...
text: They walk a moment without words, then...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: So you and Katherine never had children?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No... Thought we had time. Sometimes it seems like yesterday and others
dialog: when it seems like another life...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: ...I know what you mean...
text: They reach the courtyard.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I've done all the talking haven't I?
text: Bob reaches to gallantly open the gate for Grace, identical to the way he
text: did in Grace's dream. However, the gate is stuck. He tries again--still
text: stuck. Bob finally gives it a strong tug, but it opens too quickly and
text: he loses his balance. Bob inadvertently puts his hand around her waist
text: and pulls her close to prevent him from falling over... They are close
text: just like in Grace's daydream... We see the Deja vu expression on her
dialog: face...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Fine...just fine.
text: Bob's so close, he leans in to kiss her -- Grace SLAPS him. Bob stands
dialog: there, totally stunned...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (holding her hand)
dialog: Oh, my God--I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (rubbing his face)
dialog: Geeze, I was just going to kiss you.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I know--I'm sorry. I mean--it's not you...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (still stunned)
dialog: I was just going to kiss you. A small peck on the cheek.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: ...it's...I had this dream about you--and...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: It must have been a nightmare.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No, you were very sexy...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: You had a sex dream about me?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No, of course not. Well, it might have been. I don't know--I stopped
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: ...uh-huh.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I didn't want to--I mean--I just met you--I don't really even know
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sometimes those dreams are better with strangers.
dialog: (testing his jaw)
dialog: Ah...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Are you okay?
text: She raises her hand to touch his face, he flinches.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Fine, fine...
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Must have been some dream...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: You ripped my blouse...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's okay...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Nice blouse, was it?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Well, it was...
dialog: (points to blouse she's wearing)
dialog: This one.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Very nice...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I didn't mean to...be so forward... Not in the dream--but here just
dialog: now...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No, please, it's me... I'm...
text: Suddenly Grace takes Bob's face in her hands, kisses him on the lips and
text: joyfully runs inside--her feet barely touching the ground.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Good night.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: 'Night...
text: Bob stands alone in the courtyard. Life is good. He blows out the
text: candle--leaving him in total darkness...
speaker_heading: BOB (cont'd)
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - EARLY MORNING
text: We see Jeff, pacing outside the trailer, as he waits for Bob to arrive
text: and yell at him. Mike steps out of the trailer and checks his watch,
text: just as Bob pulls up in his truck.
text: Bob jumps out, carrying a tray of Starbuck's coffees. He walks over to
text: the guys, who can't help but notice the spring in his step.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (handing each guy a coffee)
dialog: Morning, Jeff. Morning there, Big Mike.
text: Mike and Jeff exchange a "what's gotten into him" look.
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: (disbelief)
dialog: Mornin'...
text: Mike and Jeff keep their eyes on Bob, who continues over to the...
speaker_heading: SERVICE ELEVATOR,
text: set up on the outside frame of the high rise. Bob stops, giving his
text: third coffee to some WORKMAN busy hammering. The workman smiles. Bob
text: smiles back and then takes the last coffee for himself. He "frisbee"
text: tosses the cardboard tray into a trash can and jumps on to the elevator.
text: We FOLLOW Bob on his ride to the top of the building.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: MIKE AND JEFF ON THE GROUND,
text: their heads turned upwards, watching Bob. Mike takes a sip of his
text: coffee, looks to Jeff...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (with a shrug)
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TURNER BOWLING ALLEY - LANE 13 - NIGHT
text: We FOLLOW A BRIGHT RED BOWLING BALL as it rolls at top speed into a set
text: of pins, creating the LOUD CRASH of a powerful strike. We SPIN AROUND
text: to REVEAL Wally, performing his signature "strike dance" for his
text: audience: Megan, Joe, Marty, Angelo, Emmett, Sophie, Grace. They
dialog: applaud.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: It's the new hip.
text: Joe finishes re-tying his shoes, he's next... He picks up his regular
text: black ball just as Wally's BRIGHT RED BALL pops out of the shoot. We
text: know it's Wally's ball because WALLY is inscribed in LARGE FANCY LETTERS
text: across it... Joe stares at the ball as it rolls up the return...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Wally, which one is yours?
text: Wally's leaning over Sophie, checking his score.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Shut your trap...
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: I'm talking to Joe...mark my strike.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: I did, I'm using stars instead of x's now...
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Ah, Crimeny!
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: Doesn't matter how she marks it. I'm still beating ya.
text: Bob walks up and sets down a tray of draft beers, plus one espresso for
text: Angelo, and a milk for Emmett, who is busy collecting cash from Marty...
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Ten spot on the next shot says it's a strike...
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: After Joe...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (handing Emmett a ten)
dialog: I'm in...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (yells)
dialog: C'mon Joe, send 'em running...
text: Joe takes his shot. It looks good. He walks back with confidence... In
text: the b.g. we see just the two outside pins are left standing...
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Grandma's teeth. Nice.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (winces)
dialog: It's these damn shoes...
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: Maybe you could knock 'em down with a fire hose?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Gracie, Honey, you're up next on the right.
text: Grace watches Megan clean up a spare in the next lane. Megan
text: victoriously smacks Grace five as they meet on either side of the ball
dialog: return.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (drying her hands over the blower)
dialog: The best ever. I've never seen you so happy.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: God I'm hot...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: It's eighty degrees out and you're wearing a turtle neck...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: It's cotton...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Too bad you didn't meet him in the fall, you would have been safe for
dialog: months... Tell him.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: He's a great guy, it won't make a difference to him, besides, eventually
dialog: he's gonna want to get, you know, intimate.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Megan please.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Just tell him...or he'll think you're a lesbian or something.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: It's very trendy right now.
text: Emmett's loud voice interrupts them...
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: You two's, do your yapping at the beauty parlor!
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Take it easy, Dad.
text: Bob walks over to Grace with a drink.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I got you a hot chocolate.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I thought maybe you were cold.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Thank you.
text: Their eyes lock for a beat, then Bob kisses her...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: C'mon now, let's bowl.
text: Bob and Grace come back to reality.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (re: the hot chocolate)
dialog: I'll just hold on to this for ya...
text: Grace is light as a feather, she lines up her shot, good form, releases
text: the ball... It rolls with confidence right down the center and STRIKE!
text: Everyone claps, Grace goes wild. She does a touchdown dance that goes
text: on a bit too long. Everyone stops clapping and just stares... She
text: realizes and recovers.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Alrighty, who's up next?
text: Angelo smiles, looks at Marty:
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Bob, you're up!
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: You're taking turns away? I'm next.
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
dialog: Angelo's up.
text: Bob quickly puts his beer down, just as Charlie cautiously walks up to
dialog: the group.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Hey, hey, you made it...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I thought I was meeting you at a bar?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: There's a bar here. Grace!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (looks at the old guys)
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We're bowling. What?
text: Grace comes over.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Hey Charlie, we're already in the ninth frame, or you could join the
dialog: game.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh shoot. That's OK, maybe next time.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Everyone, this is Charlie.
text: The whole gang looks up to greet him...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hi...everyone...
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: (holding cash)
dialog: You want in?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sure he does...
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: Tenspot.
text: Charlie doesn't ask questions and gives Emmett ten dollars.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: For or against?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Huh? For... I guess...
text: Bob runs up to take his turn. Joe hands Charlie a beer. Marty,
text: clapping his hands like an old baseball coach...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (yells)
dialog: C'mon Bob...tenth frame and you're looking at beating your all time
dialog: highest score...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (To Joe)
dialog: I didn't know he bowled...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: ...of sixty-seven.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He doesn't.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (checks score sheet)
dialog: You're sittin' on a sixty-six...
dialog: (very seriously)
dialog: You wanna use my ball, go ahead...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's okay, Wally. I"m not really dressed...
text: The whole gang all laughs it up...even Charlie joins in...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'd like to dedicate this next shot to Grace...
dialog: (gestures towards Grace)
dialog: who brought me back to the game after a twenty-five year absence.
dialog: That's right, before I was your beer runner and...
dialog: (to Emmett)
dialog: milk man... I hadn't bowled since Andee Jankovsky's thirteenth birthday
dialog: party... So baby, this one's for you.
text: The guys all hoot and holler. Grace and Megan laugh. Sophie is choked
dialog: up...
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: (patting Bob on the back)
dialog: You get a strike here, we go fifty-fifty...
text: A hush falls over the group... Bob lines up his shot like a pro,
dialog: arm back, perfect form, nice approach, smooth release...
text: Everyone's eyes follow the ball down the lane straight into the gutter.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Try your other arm!
text: Megan smacks Joe.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: C'mon Bobby, shake 'em up...
text: All the guys join in, cheering him on. Bob stands by the ball return.
text: Picks up his ball. Confidently, he approaches the lane... lines up his
dialog: shot, arm back, perfect form, nice approach, POWERFUL release...
text: We FOLLOW the ball as it speeds down the center of the lane, suddenly
text: veering off to left and cleanly smacking TWO PINS off the end.
dialog: The gang goes nuts...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. O'RIELLY'S - LATER - SAME NIGHT
text: Restaurant is closed, except for the gang and some other bowlers, who
text: are just leaving. Music is playing, plates of food are scattered on the
text: tables, along with half-filled bottles of wine. Sophie and Marty clean
text: up a bit. In the b.g., a table cloth with the number "68" is
text: thumbtacked on a wall. Charlie stands at the bar with Emmett
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: I've always found that Sammy Davis was the most talented and I've always
dialog: liked Bill Cosby...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, yeah, they're both great.
text: Grace joins them and hands Charlie some leftovers wrapped in foil.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: This will be good for about a week. I put some bread in there, too...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thank you... Bob, I had a great time.
dialog: (to the gang)
dialog: See you Guys...
text: The gang all responds with a friendly goodbye, "Bye Doc", "See y'Chuck",
dialog: etc.
text: Charlie takes a look around the cozy dining room, with its warm family
dialog: type atmosphere... Just for an instant, one might suspect he's a bit
text: jealous... Charlie leaves. Marty locks the door behind him.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: He's very sweet.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Charlie? Oh, yeah...
text: From across the room...
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: (shuffling cards)
dialog: Hey, there, Bob-o, you in tonight?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, Emmett, Grace and I are gonna enjoy a glass of wine out back...maybe
dialog: take a walk...
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: You two want my cadillac tonight?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: On, no... That's okay...
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Just had her waxed...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (winks at Grace)
dialog: Thanks Wally... You need a sweater?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Nope...
text: Marty brings some poker chips over from the bar to the "regular" table.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I've got a new candle out there, keeps the bugs away...
text: Bob grabs a bottle of wine and two glasses as he and Grace exit to the
text: courtyard. Marty peeks through the window...
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: Marty!
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: What?
dialog: (still peeking)
dialog: I think she'll tell him...
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: (dividing poker chips)
dialog: I don't see what the big deal is. I once dated a girl with a club foot.
dialog: She had the big shoe and everything...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You're a saint...
speaker_heading: SOPHIE
text: (disappears into the kitchen with a pile of tablecloths)
dialog: The longer she waits the harder it will be...
text: Angelo is at the stereo looking through CD's.
speaker_heading: ANGELO

speaker_heading: MARTY

dialog: Let's see...

dialog: Dean...
speaker_heading: ANGELO
dialog: Pavarotti.
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: Bing...
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (walks to stereo)
dialog: Let me handle this.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: No "Bobby"...
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: We should put on something modern... Where's your new albums?
speaker_heading: EMMETT
dialog: (joins them at stereo)
dialog: CD's.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Yeah, yeah...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (holding up two CD's)
dialog: Here's my hippest stuff...
speaker_heading: WALL

dialog: Oh, this is my favorite...

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
text: A calm breeze flows through the garden. Grace lights the candle and Bob
text: pours the wine as... the first familiar bars of Diana Ross and Smokey
text: Robinson's "I'M GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE ME" pour into the courtyard. Bob
text: and Grace freeze, then give each other a look.
text: The lyrics begin as only Smokey can sing them...
speaker_heading: SMOKEY

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Take a break, you've been working like a dog...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Grace wants to talk, she's making dinner at my place.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She wants to "talk", she's making you "dinner", she won't "spend the
dialog: night"... You see what's going on here, don't ya?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's a trap. She's read that book, what's it called... "The Rules".
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's a little game they play to reel a guy in...
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BOB

dialog: (breathy)
dialog: Yes...
text: Grace closes her eyes as Bob kisses the nape of her neck and slowly
text: unbuttons her blouse...dangerously close to revealing her scar.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: ...Now's a good time...
text: Bob slides his left hand up her "clean shaven" leg...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Oh dear...Bob...
dialog: BEEEEP...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Popcorn's done...
text: Bob keeps kissing her... The BEEEEP continues...it's loud...too loud.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Save my place...
text: As Bob runs to the kitchen, Grace glances down at her partially
text: unbuttoned blouse, then quickly downs her wine.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (leaning his head out the kitchen)
dialog: You can put on some music...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (gets up, buttons her blouse)
dialog: Sure-yes-good...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I got you a CD. It's in the pocket of my jacket, which is hanging on
text: the door in the den.
dialog: Grace goes into the
speaker_heading: DEN.
text: She closes the door, to retrieve the CD from Bob's jacket.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (smiling, yells back to Bob)
dialog: Dean Martin. Thank you.
text: Just as Grace turns to leave, she notices the newspaper on Bob's desk,
text: folded open to the article about the zoo. She picks it up...
speaker_heading: BOB (O.C.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (reading article, yells back to Bob)
dialog: I said, thanks for the...
text: Beneath a PHOTO of SYDNEY and KATHERINE, Grace reads...
scene_heading: "DR. KATHERINE RUELAND, DIED IN CAR ACCIDENT ON NOVEMBER 12,
dialog: 1995."...November 12th...
text: Then something else catches her eye...
text: She slowly moves her hand towards a PALE PINK LETTER, tucked in the
text: blotter on the desk. She picks it up, studies it a moment... a faint
text: feeling rushes through her. She covers her hand with her mouth as she
text: carefully sits down, unable to comprehend the reality...
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: Bob, carrying a bowl of popcorn, walks toward the den.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Grace?
speaker_heading: DEN,
text: Bob opens the door. Grace quickly puts the letter in her pocket.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What?
text: Grace speaks slowly, carefully...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I have to go...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Yes... I completely forgot. I... I promised Megan I'd... baby sit.
text: Grace slowly-rushes past Bob out of the den.
speaker_heading: HALLWAY,
text: She walks quickly, trying to maintain her composure. Bob is right
dialog: behind her...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (somewhat confused)
dialog: I'll go with you...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No, no...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (putting on her sweater)
dialog: Yes... You stay here. I'll call you...
text: She walks out to the front hall. Her bike is just inside the door --
text: she keeps moving -- kicking the kickstand up, it breaks off.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: This damn bike.
text: She spins it around and briskly walks it out the door...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS
text: Bob stands right next to her, grabbing her shoulders...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Grace, slow down. I'll call her and say you're on your way...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No...the baby might be napping.
dialog: (gets on the bike, desperate)
dialog: I have to go. I'm late...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Okay, okay...
dialog: (touching her arm)
dialog: What did you want to tell me?
text: Grace finally stops for a second and looks into Bob's eyes...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (sweetly, with a hidden sadness)
dialog: I love you.
text: Before Bob can say anything, she peddles away--Mel follows.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Mel. Stay.
text: Mel stops. Bob stands on the porch, watching Grace ride
dialog: away...something's wrong.

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No, let the machine get it.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I'd be home by now...

speaker_heading: MEGAN (cont'd)
dialog: You just missed her...
text: (looking at Grace's red, sad face)
dialog: No, she seemed fine...tired?
dialog: (remembers babysitting lie)
dialog: Oh yes, from the kids... Yeah, she'll probably go straight to bed... I
dialog: had the ringer off cuz of the baby... Hm-mm, I'd wait till morning...
dialog: Sure, no problem. Night.
text: Megan hangs up the phone. Grace starts crying again.
speaker_heading: MEGAN (cont'd)
dialog: He's so in love with you...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Ohmigod, ohmigod... What was God thinking?
text: Megan grabs her purse and keys off the counter.
speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Wait...no... What do I say?
speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: I know...but what do I say?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: The truth...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Just tell him... Say, Bob...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (waits for Megan to go on)
dialog: You can't even say it.
text: Joe, carrying a sleeping Tommy, walks into the kitchen, followed by
text: Patrick in his scouts uniform. Joe stops the minute he senses the mood
text: and sees the expressions on Megan and especially Grace's face...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who died?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: No one...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: Bob's wife...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He's married? That Bastard...
speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: JOE

dialog: You want me to go over there and handle this?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No...no...
speaker_heading: JOE

dialog: I knew it...he was way too nice...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Joe! Out!
dialog: (She physically leans on him)
dialog: Take the boys upstairs...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What is going on? Don't push... Grace, tell me what's going on...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (just blurts it out)
dialog: Grace has Bob's dead wife's heart... now go...
speaker_heading: JOE

text: time... Finally, Marty gets up and goes to Grace...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Grace, it is a character of strength that God gives the most
dialog: challenges...
dialog: (puts his hand under her chin)
dialog: Consider it a compliment.
text: Bob walks up to the back gate. Marty sees him first...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Excuse me, I was wondering if a beautiful artist lived here?
text: Grace doesn't turn for a second. Marty spins her around...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Robert.
text: (squeezes Grace's shoulders and turns to leave)
dialog: I was just telling Grace you called and said you'd be stopping by.
text: Marty exits. Grace is a bundle of nerves... Bob opens the gate,
text: REVEALING a shiny new red and white bike with a big ribbon on it. He
text: rings its BELL.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: A bike...
dialog: (deeply touched)
dialog: You bought me a bike...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (taking off the ribbon)
dialog: You haven't even opened it yet.
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: With a basket...
text: She hugs him and holds on tightly...overcome with emotion.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I think she likes it.

dialog: Grace...is everything okay?
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: (pulls away, but stays close)
dialog: No...I waited too long...to tell you something...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're trembling...
text: Grace takes Bob's hand and places it at the nape of her neck. Softly,
text: she guides his fingers down inside her blouse... She looks deeply into
text: his eyes, while gently touching her scar with his fingers...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: A little over a year ago, I had a heart transplant...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh my God...
dialog: (sigh of relief)
dialog: I thought you were going to tell me you were married or something...
dialog: (hugs her, squeezes her)
dialog: Are you okay?
dialog: (lets up a bit on the hug)
dialog: Am I hurting you.. Are you alright now?
text: Grace's eyes well with tears...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: No...yes...
text: Now sobbing, she reaches into her pocket and takes out the pink
dialog: envelope...
speaker_heading: GRACE
dialog: This is me...
dialog: (hands the letter to Bob)
text: Bob stares at the familiar pale pink envelope... Grace watching him...
dialog: should she touch him, should she speak, should she leave?
text: Bob's legs weaken as he looks in Grace's eyes. She grabs his arms and
text: together they fall to their knees. Grace comforts him without
text: words...cradling him in her arms...slowly she presses his cheek to her
text: chest... Bob closes his tearful eyes and listens.

speaker_heading: GRACE

speaker_heading: BOB

dialog: Yeah sure...
speaker_heading: MARTY

dialog: sorting, just know, that when I prayed and prayed for Grace to get

text: As Bob looks up at the habitat, Sydney is sitting in the Oak tree
text: staring at him... Bob does the "sign" for "Hi". Sydney signs something
text: back... Bob's not sure what. Sydney repeats the sign... Bob gets up and
text: goes to a DISPLAY illustrating the proper "sign" for each LETTER OF THE
speaker_heading: ALPHABET.
text: He looks up at Sydney, who impatiently "signs" the same message. Bob
text: looks to the board and matches the first letter... "G". He looks to
