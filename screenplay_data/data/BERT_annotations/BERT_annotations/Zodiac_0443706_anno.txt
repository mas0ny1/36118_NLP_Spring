speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Where have you been? I've been
dialog: waiting since seven.
text: At the wheel is DARLENE FERRIN, 22, clad in a WHITE AND BLUE

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: You coming or not?
scene_heading: EXT. MR. ED'S -- NIGHT
text: BOOM DOWN to see a local Vallejo teen hangout. Although the

text: (still driving) and Mike, cruising through the crowded lot.
text: She sees something offscreen. Frowning, unnerved:
speaker_heading: DARLENE

text: one person in it. Odd for a make out spot.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that the car that was behind us
dialog: before?
text: Darlene doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)

dialog: move to get out...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I can to tell him to leave-
text: She puts her hand over his. Looks at him. Don't move. They
text: wait for what seems an eternity. Then...
text: The other car PULLS FORWARD. Headlights click BACK ON.
text: Passing the Corvair. They watch it go, finally disappearing
text: over the horizon.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who was that, Darlene?

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: Darlene, FROZEN.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, Darlene.
text: The car pulls to a halt behind the Corvair. In an off-line
dialog: position, like a COP.
text: Mike, reaching over to start the engine when - A SPOTLIGHT
text: from inside the other car hits the Corvair.
text: The door opens and THE COP inside gets out. Walks up to the
text: car. Flashlight outstretched, shining it in Mike and
text: Darlene's faces, blinding them. He reaches Mike's door.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get your I.D.
dialog: (rolls down his
dialog: window)
dialog: Man, you kinda creeped us-â€”
text: THUNK! Mike's BLOOD AND TEETH EXPLODE onto the dashboard.
text: The muzzle of a SILENCER FLASHES. The Man KEEPS SHOOTING.
text: BULLETS PUNCH through flesh and bone. Some shots rip straight
text: through Mike and into Darlene.
text: Mike is shot in the face, the neck, and the arm. Darlene is
text: shot twice in each arm, and three times in the back.
text: The Man lowers the gun. Silence.
text: The Man turns away. Walking back to his car. A GROAN. The
text: Man turns. Walks back to the Corvair, reloading. Mike.
text: Still alive.
text: The Man FIRES TWO MORE SHOTS into Mike, propelling him into
text: the BACK SEAT. Then TWO MORE into Darlene for good measure.

dialog: I like killing people because it

dialog: Something gives me the most
dialog: thrilling experience, it is even
dialog: better than getting your rocks off
text: with a girl. The best part of it
dialog: is that when I die I will be

speaker_heading: THE MAN

text: Then steps back, surveying his handiwork.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Now that it's all said and done -
dialog: was the gun really loaded?
text: The Man pops the clip. Removes a SHINY BULLET. Showing

text: he's going to get himself untied once the Man leaves when-
text: The Man pulls the KNIFE from the scabbard and STABS BRYAN IN

speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I'll get someone...
text: Somehow, he manages to STAND. Stooped over, arms crossed

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Why not?

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH

speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Consonant?
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: The double L. And what's the one
dialog: word we know Zodiac will use in
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: "Kill".
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Exactly, so the Hardens start
dialog: looking for double symbols which
dialog: they find here, here, and here -
dialog: each with the same two symbols
dialog: preceding them. Now they've got a
dialog: repeating four letter word ending
text: with two symbols they assume stand
dialog: for "L"-
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: (getting into it)
dialog: And since they think the whole
dialog: word is "Kill"-
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: That gives them the symbols for

speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG

speaker_heading: BELLI
dialog: Inspectors, he sent the letter

speaker_heading: TOSCHI

speaker_heading: BELLI

speaker_heading: NARLOW
dialog: Maybe yes, maybe no.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH

dialog: while committing a murder, how the
dialog: hell do you leave a fingerprint?
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: But it was in blood. They found
dialog: it at the scene-
speaker_heading: NARLOW
dialog: All it takes is one curious
dialog: civilian or cop to reach out and
dialog: touch something and boom - false

speaker_heading: VAUGHN

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: I wanted to ask you about a

dialog: there. "The Most Dangerous Game".
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Classic. RKO, 1932. Fay Wray.

text: Graysmith doesn't follow. Vaughn pulls out a coil of FILM
speaker_heading: LEADER.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN (CONT'D)
text: The Zodiac symbol on film. On the

dialog: immediately thought of this.
text: Graysmith looks - STANDARD ACADEMY LEADER COUNTDOWN, which

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: We got a tip that Rick left a film

speaker_heading: VAUGHN

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH

speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Rick didn't draw any posters.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: What? No, he did this one-
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters
dialog: personally. That's my handwriting.
text: An awful moment. Graysmith looks to the locked door. Vaughn
text: stares at him. Hard. Graysmith puts on a brave face.
text: Rises.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: I won't take any more of your time-
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Not at all. Before you go, I should

speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: The very detailed posters I kept,
dialog: but the one-off cheapos like that
dialog: one there I just threw into the
dialog: back alley... Here we go.
text: They finally stop by an overstuffed bookshelf. Vaughn pulls

text: pages. Graysmith looks around, nervous.
text: The bulb above them flickers. Vaughn reaches up and tweaks
text: it with a finger - the light goes constant again. Above
text: Graysmith's head, the CEILING BOARDS CREAK. As though
text: someone were WALKING AROUND UPSTAIRS.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: You live alone?
text: Vaughn nods absently, still searching the book.
speaker_heading: VAUGHN
dialog: Here it is. "The Most Dangerous

text: Graysmith emerges from the cellar. Looking around. No one.
text: He hurries to the door, grasps the knob and... LOCKED. From

text: it. He's TRAPPED. The floorboards creak behind him and he
text: SPINS TO SEE... VAUGHN. Standing in the cellar doorway.
text: Slowly walking towards him. Menacing. Reaching into his

speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Allen and the Zodiac. Their

speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: Christmas of 68.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Eight months after Allen's fired
dialog: for molesting children and his
dialog: family discovers he was a
dialog: pedophile. When did the letters
dialog: begin?
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: July of 69.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: After the second murder and they
dialog: continue until you interview
dialog: Allen. Did any letters after that
text: contain swatches of Stine's shirt?
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Because he dumped it. He got
dialog: scared. Because you went to see
dialog: him at work. When's the next time

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Which means he's silent for three

text: by '74 he feels safe again.
dialog: Everyone's moved off Allen as a
dialog: suspect. So Zodiac writes three
dialog: new letters - January, May, and
dialog: July in '74.
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: But then the letters stopped
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: What happened to Allen?
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: He was arrested. January of '75.
dialog: They sent him to Atascadero. We
dialog: didn't get a single letter while

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: And when is he released?
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: August of '77.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH

text: Toschi leans forward.
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: I've got one question.
text: Graysmith looks at him, expectantly.
speaker_heading: TOSCHI (CONT'D)
dialog: Zodiac had to have known Darlene
dialog: Ferrin, right?
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Because of the phone calls on the
dialog: night of her murder, that's right.
speaker_heading: TOSCHI

text: Silence. Graysmith stares at him.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: This is a case that's covered both
