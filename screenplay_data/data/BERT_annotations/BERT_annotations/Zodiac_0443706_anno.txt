text: The driver HONKS. MIKE MAGEAU races out. Skinny at 19.
text: Runs up to the window. To the camera:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Where have you been? I've been
dialog: waiting since seven.
text: At the wheel is DARLENE FERRIN, 22, clad in a WHITE AND BLUE

dialog: eaten in like twenty four hours.
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: DARLENE (CONT'D)
dialog: You coming or not?
scene_heading: EXT. MR. ED'S -- NIGHT
text: BOOM DOWN to see a local Vallejo teen hangout. Although the
text: 60's are almost over, Vallejo didn't get the memo. Darlene
text: (still driving) and Mike, cruising through the crowded lot.
text: She sees something offscreen. Frowning, unnerved:
speaker_heading: DARLENE
dialog: Screw this place.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I thought you needed to eat.

text: He shifts closer. Then, through the windshield - HEADLIGHTS.
text: Signaling to turn into the lot. The car pulls to a halt
text: eight feet behind them on their left side. Turning out the
text: lights. But not the engine. Mike stares at the car. Only
text: one person in it. Odd for a make out spot.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that the car that was behind us
dialog: before?
text: Darlene doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)

dialog: move to get out...
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I can to tell him to leave-
text: She puts her hand over his. Looks at him. Don't move. They
text: wait for what seems an eternity. Then...
text: The other car PULLS FORWARD. Headlights click BACK ON.
text: Passing the Corvair. They watch it go, finally disappearing
text: over the horizon.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Who was that, Darlene?

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: Darlene, FROZEN.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, Darlene.
text: The car pulls to a halt behind the Corvair. In an off-line
dialog: position, like a COP.
text: Mike, reaching over to start the engine when - A SPOTLIGHT
text: from inside the other car hits the Corvair.
text: The door opens and THE COP inside gets out. Walks up to the
text: car. Flashlight outstretched, shining it in Mike and
text: Darlene's faces, blinding them. He reaches Mike's door.
speaker_heading: MIKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get your I.D.
dialog: (rolls down his
dialog: window)
dialog: Man, you kinda creeped us-—
text: THUNK! Mike's BLOOD AND TEETH EXPLODE onto the dashboard.
text: The muzzle of a SILENCER FLASHES. The Man KEEPS SHOOTING.
text: BULLETS PUNCH through flesh and bone. Some shots rip straight
text: through Mike and into Darlene.
text: Mike is shot in the face, the neck, and the arm. Darlene is
text: shot twice in each arm, and three times in the back.
text: The Man lowers the gun. Silence.
text: The Man turns away. Walking back to his car. A GROAN. The
text: Man turns. Walks back to the Corvair, reloading. Mike.
text: Still alive.
text: The Man FIRES TWO MORE SHOTS into Mike, propelling him into
text: the BACK SEAT. Then TWO MORE into Darlene for good measure.

dialog: I like killing people because it

dialog: Something gives me the most
dialog: thrilling experience, it is even
dialog: better than getting your rocks off
text: with a girl. The best part of it
dialog: is that when I die I will be

dialog: It gets cold at night, we could

text: The Man steps points the gun at him at point blank range:
speaker_heading: THE MAN
dialog: Get down! Right now!

text: Then steps back, surveying his handiwork.
speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: Now that it's all said and done -
dialog: was the gun really loaded?
text: The Man pops the clip. Removes a SHINY BULLET. Showing
text: Bryan. Then puts it away. Moving behind him, out of his
text: line of vision. Bryan, lying there, trying to figure out how
text: he's going to get himself untied once the Man leaves when-
text: The Man pulls the KNIFE from the scabbard and STABS BRYAN IN
text: THE BACK. It happens so quick, it takes a moment for Cecelia

speaker_heading: BRYAN
dialog: I'll get someone...
text: Somehow, he manages to STAND. Stooped over, arms crossed

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH

speaker_heading: AVERY

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH

speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: No. You can't think of this case

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Why not?
text: Avery stares at him. He's not going away. Avery sighs and

speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Consider the fingerprint. You

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AVERY

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: What is the most common double

speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: Consonant?
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: The double L. And what's the one
dialog: word we know Zodiac will use in
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: "Kill".
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Exactly, so the Hardens start
dialog: looking for double symbols which
dialog: they find here, here, and here -
dialog: each with the same two symbols
dialog: preceding them. Now they've got a
dialog: repeating four letter word ending
text: with two symbols they assume stand
dialog: for "L"-
speaker_heading: AVERY
dialog: (getting into it)
dialog: And since they think the whole
dialog: word is "Kill"-
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: That gives them the symbols for

speaker_heading: AVERY

speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG (0.S.)

speaker_heading: ARMSTRONG
dialog: Poor fellow.
speaker_heading: BELLI
dialog: Inspectors, he sent the letter

speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: He called here?
speaker_heading: BELLI

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH

speaker_heading: TOSCHI

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH (CONT'D)

text: He points to the PRESIDIO LIBRARY LIST. Almost the entire

speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: "Missing"?
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: That means the book was stolen.
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: Almost every book on ciphers was

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: And the Oakland Army Terminal

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH

speaker_heading: NARLOW
dialog: Maybe yes, maybe no.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: NARLOW
dialog: Zodiac left gloves behind. If you

dialog: while committing a murder, how the
dialog: hell do you leave a fingerprint?
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: But it was in blood. They found
dialog: it at the scene-
speaker_heading: NARLOW
dialog: All it takes is one curious
dialog: civilian or cop to reach out and
dialog: touch something and boom - false
dialog: print. Take a look at the crime

speaker_heading: LEADER.

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to look at this stuff

speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Allen and the Zodiac. Their
dialog: timelines. When was the first
dialog: murder in Vallejo?
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: Christmas of 68.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Eight months after Allen's fired
dialog: for molesting children and his
dialog: family discovers he was a
dialog: pedophile. When did the letters
dialog: begin?
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: July of 69.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: After the second murder and they
dialog: continue until you interview
dialog: Allen. Did any letters after that
text: contain swatches of Stine's shirt?
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Because he dumped it. He got
dialog: scared. Because you went to see
dialog: him at work. When's the next time

speaker_heading: TOSCHI

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Which means he's silent for three

text: by '74 he feels safe again.
dialog: Everyone's moved off Allen as a
dialog: suspect. So Zodiac writes three
dialog: new letters - January, May, and
dialog: July in '74.
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: But then the letters stopped
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: What happened to Allen?
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: He was arrested. January of '75.
dialog: They sent him to Atascadero. We
dialog: didn't get a single letter while
dialog: he was in there.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: And when is he released?
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: August of '77.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH

text: Toschi leans forward.
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: I've got one question.
text: Graysmith looks at him, expectantly.
speaker_heading: TOSCHI (CONT'D)
dialog: Zodiac had to have known Darlene
dialog: Ferrin, right?
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: Because of the phone calls on the
dialog: night of her murder, that's right.
speaker_heading: TOSCHI
dialog: And because of this report, we

dialog: "Lee" in the report? Vallejo's a

dialog: small. How do you know they're
dialog: connected?
text: Silence. Graysmith stares at him.
speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
dialog: This is a case that's covered both
dialog: Northern and Southern California

speaker_heading: GRAYSMITH
