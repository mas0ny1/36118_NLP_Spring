speaker_heading: WALT

speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Just a minute.
text: He stands there, motionless, soaking in the place. For a

speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Yeah, but I don’t see myself as a

speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: Did you ever love Dad? Cause if you

dialog: If you were going to leave him, why

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: It wasn’t planned. When we first met,

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: WALT

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I’m sorry. I think I don’t know what

speaker_heading: WALT
dialog: You have a way of saying things

speaker_heading: JOAN

dialog: You were leaving no matter what...
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You never made a dinner.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: I made burgers the time you had

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Only after I insisted!
speaker_heading: BERNARD

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I was ready to leave a long time ago.
dialog: I just didn’t know it then.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: I’ve been giving it some thought. I
dialog: mean, you called my father at the last

dialog: marriage.
text: Bernard and Walt quickly meet eyes.
speaker_heading: BERNARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You felt I wasn’t aggressive enough.
dialog: I’1ll make more of an effort to do
dialog: stuff. I’ve been cooking and doing

text: Frank looks at his father as if to say, “What are you
dialog: talking about?”
speaker_heading: BERNARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Why don't we all have dinner and talk
dialog: more about this.
text: Joan starts to laugh. It catches her off guard. It’s
text: clearly out of her control. She tries to stop, she sucks
text: it in, but it erupts to a hysterical level. The two boys
text: and Bernard watch her as she continues to shake and laugh.
text: Nobody says anything. Finally it dies down. She wipes the

text: in, he just grows angry.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: I’1l sue you, Joan. You know I will.
dialog: You had an affair for four years with
dialog: that fucking shrink that ruined our
dialog: marriage and I can get the kids. I
dialog: talked to Eddie Goodman, who works on

text: A pause.
speaker_heading: JOAN
