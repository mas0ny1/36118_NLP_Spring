speaker_heading: FADE IN:
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON SAM BALDWIN
dialog: A card: Chicago.
text: He's in his thirties. His neck is pinched into a crisp
text: dress shirt and tie. His expression is vacant, faraway.
text: A breeze blows but he doesn't react to it. In the
text: distance the architecture of the Chicago skyline.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mommy got sick and it happened
dialog: just like that and there was
dialog: nothing anybody would do.
dialog: (continued)
dialog: And pull back to reveal:
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO - A GRAVESITE - DAY
text: Next to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9. Sam's hand is on
text: his shoulder. As the mourners go past and each takes a
text: turn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: If we start asking why we'll go
dialog: crazy. So, rule number one.
dialog: We don't ask why.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON ANNIE REED
text: Pretty, blonde, animated. Jeans, a T-shirt, a Baltimore
dialog: Orioles hat.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Why? I just want to know why?
dialog: That's my first rule. I always
dialog: ask why. Come on. Tell me.
dialog: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
dialog: And pull back to reveal:
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - DAY
text: Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy
text: named SETH. They're carrying packing boxes into the
dialog: house they share in the Old Town section of Chicago.
text: The same stunning architecture in the b.g. They go up
text: the back wooden staircase to the house.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: There's no why, Annie. I'm
dialog: just not up for it. I never
dialog: said I was.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Is there somebody else?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You don't love me, is that it?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Nope.
dialog: Follow them into:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DUSK
text: As they set down the packing boxes and Seth starts to
dialog: assemble them.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: How about ... you're too
dialog: narcissistic to commit to
dialog: another human being in a long-
dialog: term way.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (agreeably)
dialog: That's good.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S CHICAGO TOWN HOUSE - DAY
text: An attractive, thirtyish couple, SUZY and GREG are
text: stocking Sam's freezer with enough Ziploc meals for a
text: months. A number of friends and relatives talk quietly
text: in the living room beyond. Sam stands alone by a window
text: that looks into the backyard. We can see a garden of
text: flowers -- clearly planted by Sam's wife.
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: Five minutes in the microwave.
dialog: Any one of them, five minutes
dialog: and done. Ready to eat. Do
dialog: you know how to make juice?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Microwave. Five minutes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ANNIE'S KITCHEN - SEVERAL DAYS LATER
text: Packing boxes. Seth is moving out.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You take the microwave?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What am I going to do with a
dialog: microwave?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You turn it on, you open it and
dialog: you stand in front of it for a
dialog: very long time.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: So you're angry. Big deal.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: SAM'S OFFICE - DAY
text: A large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high-
text: rise. Lake Michigan out the window. A large space with
text: several architects consulting, drafting, etc. Sam is at
text: his desk, working. An older colleague, ROB, comes over
text: to him. Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind
dialog: but a little stuffy.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Young man, it's none of my
dialog: business, but maybe you should
dialog: talk to someone. I myself
dialog: have consulted a professional.
dialog: I used to be up tight.
dialog: On Sam's face. It's hard to imagine Rob being any more
text: uptight than he is. Sam takes some business cards out
text: of his shirt pocket and reads them off.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...
dialog: Loss of Spouse support groups...
dialog: Single parent discussion nights...
dialog: Parents without partners.
dialog: (starts riffling, angry)
dialog: Partners without parents.
dialog: People who need people. Guys
dialog: who go into the woods, beat
dialog: drums and bond. Get a shrink.
dialog: Hug a friend. Hug yourself.
text: He stops, realizing that everyone in the room is staring
text: at him. Quickly they pretend they weren't paying
text: attention. Someone whispers something to a client.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continued)
dialog: Don't mind him. He's the guy
dialog: who just lost his wife.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What I really think is we need
dialog: a change.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Good idea. Take a few weeks
dialog: off, get some sun, take Jonah
dialog: fishing --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (shaking his head no)
text: A real change. New city.
dialog: Someplace where every time I go
dialog: around a corner I don't think
dialog: of Maggie.
dialog: And hold on Sam for a moment and--
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - DAY
text: Sam, Jonah and Maggie walking toward the field. It's a
text: gorgeous day for a game. They high-five each other.
speaker_heading: ROB (V.O.)
dialog: Where you going to go?
dialog: And cut back to:
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I was thinking about Seattle.
scene_heading: INT. CHICAGO TRIBUNE - DAY
text: The Living Section of the paper. Annie is blowing her
text: nose as she finishes telling her tale of woe to her
text: boss, LAURIE JOHNSON.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Honey, he wasn't right for you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (blowing her nose)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: He wasn't even wrong for you,
dialog: like cosmically wrong, so don't
dialog: beat up on yourself for
dialog: wasting...however long it was.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I know.
dialog: (blowing her nose
dialog: again)
text: She pours Annie a cup of hot water. Annie pulls a
text: teabag out of her pocket, puts it into the water.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Maybe you should see a shrink.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I want my money.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Go home for the weekend.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: That's what I'm going to do.
dialog: I'm going to go home.
dialog: (she thinks about it)
dialog: I quit. Laurie, I quit. I'm
dialog: going back to Baltimore.
dialog: (she's giddy)
dialog: How does a blonde do a high-
dialog: five?
text: She smacks herself in the head.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: O'HARE AIRPORT - DAY
text: The X where walkway K crosses with walkway L. Coming
text: down walkway K are Sam, Jonah, Suzy, Greg, their son
text: MACK, and several other friends.
text: And coming down walkway L is Annie with Laurie and a
text: couple of FRIENDS from the paper, JUDITH and DIANE.
text: They pass each other going in diagonal directions and
dialog: continue on.
dialog: We stay with Sam's group:
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (to Mack)
dialog: Dad says I'm going to get used
dialog: to it, but I don't think you
dialog: can ever get used to a
dialog: designated hitter.
dialog: overlap:
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: (to Sam)
dialog: Eventually, in a few months,
dialog: you'll start seeing women,
dialog: you'll meet someone.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Move on. Right. That's what
dialog: I'm going to do. In a few
dialog: months, boom, I'll be fine,
dialog: I'll just grow a new heart.
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I'm sorry --
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Sam, she didn't mean --
text: Sam is shaking his head no as they reach the gate for
dialog: the Seattle plane.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know, I know.
dialog: (emphatic)
dialog: Look, it doesn't happen twice.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Annie's group, as they approach the gate for the
dialog: Baltimore plane.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm going to meet someone,
dialog: someone nice and stable who
dialog: wears a hat so he won't catch a
dialog: cold, and I'm going to marry
dialog: him and have three children
dialog: and live happily ever after.
dialog: I mean, I am not cut out for this
dialog: --
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: For life as we know it.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Just make sure he isn't fat
dialog: like my Michael or you'll spend
dialog: your whole life worrying he's
dialog: going to drop dead.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: God, you guys are so romantic.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Do you know how long romance
dialog: lasts?
dialog: (she snaps her fingers)
dialog: That long.
speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Steven still brings me flowers
dialog: every Friday and we've been
dialog: married 10 years.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: (to Diane)
dialog: Honey, nobody wants to hear
dialog: that.
dialog: (to Annie)
dialog: Here, darling, have some Tic
dialog: Tacs.
text: Kissing everyone. Annie starts toward the plane, loaded
dialog: with stuff.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: The next time you see me I am
dialog: going to be incredibly happy.
scene_heading: INT. PLANE - NIGHT
text: Sam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the
text: runway. He notices his father's distractedness, reaches
text: over and takes his hand. Sam comes back into focus.
speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: forget that. That's rule
dialog: number two.

scene_heading: INT. PLANE - NIGHT
text: Annie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the
dialog: runway.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: I guess it's just us.
text: She gulps.
scene_heading: EXT. O'HARA AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for
dialog: instructions.
text: And now they both start to take off. In opposite
dialog: directions.
text: And we pull back back back back as the planes take off,
text: one flying east, the other flying west.
text: And further and further back as they soar into the air
text: and leave the frame.
dialog: The night sky.
dialog: Stars twinkle.
text: And now tilt down to see the United States. It looks
text: like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by
dialog: Saul Steinberg.
text: A light goes on in Baltimore.
text: A light goes on in Seattle.
text: They are the only lights on the map.
scene_heading: EXT. BALTIMORE SUN BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - CHRISTMAS EVE
text: As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER
text: JACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat. They're
text: carrying an armful of Christmas presents. They're
text: walking toward the parking lot.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The short one with black hair
dialog: is your cousin Irene --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: -- who's married to --
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Harold, who ran away with his
dialog: secretary but came back --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: -- because Irene threatened to
dialog: put the dog to sleep if he
dialog: didn't --
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And your brother Tom is a
dialog: psychology professor and is
dialog: married to...Betsy --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: -- who is the most competitive
dialog: woman in the world --
text: They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and
text: pull out together.
scene_heading: EXT. A HOUSE IN BALTIMORE SUBURBS - NIGHT
text: Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in
text: front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park
text: their cars. They get out assembling presents.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Your Uncle Milton lost all his
dialog: money in a Puerto Rican
dialog: condominium that went belly up,
dialog: don't mention the IRS or the
dialog: Federal prison system. Your
dialog: mother is Barbara, your father
dialog: is Cliff --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I hope he doesn't get out his
dialog: slides.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Am I what they had in mind?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: They're going to love you.
text: As they start toward the house.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Walter and I are engaged!
text: And the family's at the diner table. Annie's family is
dialog: a completely normally-looking WASP family -- only
dialog: everyone is a little eccentric. Annie's mother BARBARA,
text: a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman,
text: claps her hands together. Her father CLIFF, who's at
text: the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.
text: Annie's brother TOM and his wife BETSY are at the table,
text: along with cousin IRENE and her husband HAROLD. UNCLE
text: MILTON, who's Irene's father and Barbara's brother.
dialog: There are about FIVE CHILDREN there, too.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: That's wonderful, Annie. I
dialog: hope it lasts... for years
dialog: and years.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (the competitive one)
dialog: Do you have a ring?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No. Not yet.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Oh. Well. How will anyone
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Because you're going to call
dialog: them all and tell them.
dialog: Congratulations, Walter.
text: He claps Walter on the back.
text: Walter sneezes. And sneezes again.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: It's nothing. Nothing.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's probably just the flowers --
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: We'll move them --
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Don't touch them. I feel
text: terrible sneezing at a time
dialog: like this. This is a big
dialog: moment for me --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: He's allergic to everything,
dialog: don't worry about it --
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Bees. I'm allergic to bees.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Not salmon I hope --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: If he eats one tiny piece of a
dialog: nut --
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (cheerfully)
text: My head swells up like a
dialog: watermelon and I drop dead.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: It's the same with Harold and
dialog: bees.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Your mother and I had salmon at
dialog: our wedding, and I really think
dialog: a wedding without cold salmon --
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm not allergic to salmon. I
dialog: don't think. But you never
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You never know.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Oh, honey, I feel terrible, we
dialog: used up this magnum of
dialog: champagne we were saving on
dialog: something else, what did we use
dialog: it for?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Uncle Milton's parole --
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: UNCLE MILTON
dialog: And it was delicious.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It was, wasn't it, Milton
dialog: darling --
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: When are you getting married,
dialog: Annie?
speaker_heading: CLIFF
text: In early June. In the garden.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Does it have to be in the garden?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What about Harold and bees?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: We'll spray you.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: Cold salmon. A lovely cucumber
dialog: salad. Strawberries.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm afraid I'm allergic to
dialog: strawberries.
speaker_heading: CLIFF
dialog: No strawberries.
text: Annie smiles at Walter.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (to Walter)
dialog: Is that all right with you?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (to Lou Gehrig line)
dialog: Today I consider myself the
dialog: luckiest man on the face of
dialog: the earth.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What are you wearing?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I wish you would wear my dress.
dialog: I only wore it once, and you'll
dialog: barely have to do anything to
dialog: it except take it in in the
dialog: bust --
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I have something that might do
dialog: --
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides
text: of cloud formations in Guatemala. In the next room
text: Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas
dialog: carols.
scene_heading: INT. BACK STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
text: MAX, one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to
dialog: burp.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - NIGHT
text: The sound of Christmas carols from below.
text: The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with
text: her mother. They come to a dressmakers dummy with a
text: sheet over it. Barbara removes the sheet. A beautiful
text: antique dress. A veil sitting on top of the dummy.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: The Historical Society wanted
dialog: this and I never would give it
dialog: to them --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Granny's dress. Oh, Mom.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I notice these things are back
dialog: in fashion. Oh, honey.
dialog: (tears are rolling down
text: her face as she tries
dialog: the veil on Annie)
dialog: He's a lovely man, Annie.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I know. He's wonderful, isn't
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Are his folks nice?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You'll love them. We're going
dialog: down to D.C. tonight to be with
dialog: them Christmas morning.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: How did it happen?
text: Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back
text: of the dress and remove it from the dummy.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's silly, really. I mean,
dialog: I'd seen him at the office,
dialog: obviously I'd seen him, he's
dialog: the associate publisher, and
dialog: then one day we both ordered
dialog: sandwiches from the same place,
dialog: and he got my lettuce and
dialog: tomato sandwich on whole wheat,
dialog: which of course he was allergic
dialog: to, and I got his lettuce and
dialog: tomato on white.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (utterly without irony)
dialog: How amazing.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It is, isn't it? You make
dialog: millions of decisions that mean
dialog: nothing and then one day you
dialog: decide to order takeout and it
dialog: changes your life.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: Destiny takes a hand.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh, please. Destiny's just
dialog: something we've invented
dialog: because we can't stand the fact
dialog: that everything that happens is
dialog: accidental.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Then how do you explain that
dialog: you both ordered exactly the
dialog: same sandwich except for the
dialog: bread? How many people in this
dialog: world like lettuce and tomato
dialog: without something else like
dialog: tuna?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It wasn't a sign. It was a
dialog: coincidence.
text: Barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie
text: steps into it.
text: Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I was in Atlantic City with my
dialog: family. Cliff was a waiter.
dialog: He talked me into sneaking out
dialog: for a midnight walk on the
dialog: Steel Pier. I've probably told
dialog: you this a million times, but
dialog: I don't care. And then he held
dialog: my hand. I was scared. All
dialog: sorts of thing were going
dialog: through my head. But after a
dialog: while I forgot about them. At
dialog: one point I looked down, at our
dialog: hands, and I couldn't tell
dialog: which fingers were mine and
dialog: which were his. And I knew.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (hearing it for the
dialog: first time)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You know.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (she doesn't know, but
dialog: she doesn't want her
dialog: mother to know she
dialog: doesn't know)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Magic. It was magic.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (repeating)
dialog: Magic.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I knew we would be together
dialog: forever, and that everything
dialog: would be wonderful, just the
dialog: way you feel about Walter.
dialog: Walter. It's quite a formal
dialog: name, isn't it?
dialog: (lowering her voice)
dialog: One of the things I truly knew
dialog: was that your father and I were
dialog: going to have a wonderful time
dialog: ... in the sack I believe you
dialog: call it --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Mom!
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Of course it took several years
dialog: before everything worked like
dialog: clockwork in that department,
dialog: so don't be worried if it takes
dialog: a while --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Mom, we already...
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Well, fine, fine. Fiddle da
dialog: dee. And how's it working?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Like... clockwork.
text: She turns to look in the mirror. The dress doesn't fit
text: at all. It's completely lopsided. One shoulder is
text: higher than the other. The waist is in the wrong spot.
text: The effect is quite comical.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: So you'll get married in a new
dialog: dress.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's a sign.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (gently)
dialog: You don't believe in signs.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATE
text: The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on
text: the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out.
speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I love you, Walter.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did anyone ever call you
dialog: anything other than Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Even when you were young?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Nope. Not even when I was
dialog: young.
text: It's starting to rain.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You sure you don't want to
dialog: drive with me?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: How will I get back to
dialog: Baltimore Saturday?
dialog: (remembering something)
dialog: Oh God, I forgot my present for
dialog: your stepmother -- I took it
dialog: inside by accident.
speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: JONAH (V.O.)
dialog: It's not that late in Seattle.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

dialog: Christmas, and you know what

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: JONAH (V.O.)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: JONAH (V.O.)
dialog: It's very hard for him to talk
dialog: about this stuff. It's like it
dialog: makes him sadder.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: You want me to talk to him?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Perfect. Sandbag the father.
speaker_heading: JONAH (V.O.)
dialog: And you crazy? He thinks shows
dialog: like this are dumb. If you
dialog: didn't have an 800 number I
dialog: could never get away with this
dialog: --
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Is he home right now?
speaker_heading: JONAH (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Well, I think I can help a
dialog: little more if I talk to him
dialog: directly.
speaker_heading: JONAH (V.O.)
dialog: I don't know --
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: I'm sure he won't be angry once
dialog: he realizes how concerned you
dialog: are about him.
speaker_heading: JONAH (V.O.)
dialog: Okay, but if I get yelled at,
dialog: I'm never gonna listen to this
dialog: show again.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Fair enough.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
text: Jonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the
dialog: houseboat he lives in with Sam. He's got the phone cord
text: coming out of the small first-floor study, and he's
text: standing near the kitchen end of a large living area
text: looking out at the back deck, where his dad is sitting
text: in a deck chair looking out at the sea.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Dad --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ON ANNIE AGAIN.
speaker_heading: JONAH (V.O.)
dialog: There's somebody on the phone
dialog: for you.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: His name is Sam.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: This is completely disgusting.
scene_heading: INT. BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
text: Sam pokes his head in the back door. He looks much as
dialog: he did eighteen months earlier, except that his hair is
text: a little longer. He picks up the phone extension.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia
dialog: Fieldstone on Network America.
text: Sam looks across the room to Jonah.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm probably not interested in
dialog: whatever you're selling.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: I'm not selling anything. Your
dialog: son called and asked for advice
dialog: on how to find you a new wife.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (he really didn't get
dialog: her name)
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: (repeating herself)
dialog: Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of
dialog: Network America.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Jesus, are we on the air?
dialog: Jonah, for God's sake --
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Don't be mad at me, Dad.
text: Sam can see Jonah. He's frightened. Sam immediately
dialog: feels how upset Jonah is.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: He feels that since your wife's
dialog: death you've been very unhappy.
dialog: He's genuinely worried about you.
text: Sam is looking at Jonah, who's rooted to the spot he's
dialog: standing on.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (to Jonah)
dialog: I'm not mad at you. Okay, I'm
dialog: not mad at you.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: I think it's hard for him to
dialog: talk to you about all this.
dialog: Maybe we could talk and it
dialog: would make him feel a little
dialog: better.
text: Sam hesitates.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Please --
scene_heading: INT. ANNIE'S CAR - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: This is a grotesque violation
dialog: of this man's personal life,
dialog: but never mind --
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: All righ...
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Good. How long ago did your
dialog: wife die?
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's been about a year and a
dialog: half.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Have you had any relationship
dialog: since?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
dialog: Sam is very uncomfortable about this --
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look, Doctor, I don't want to
dialog: be rude, but --
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: And I don't want to invade your
dialog: privacy --
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Sure you do.
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Sure you do --
text: Annie smiles.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look, we had a tough time at
dialog: first, but I think I'm holding
dialog: my own as a dad, and Jonah and
dialog: I will get along fine again as
dialog: soon as I break his radio.
text: Annie laughs. So does Mr. Fieldstone
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
text: Jonah is smiling too.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: I have no doubt that you're a
dialog: good dad. You can tell a lot
text: from a person's voice. But
dialog: something must be missing if
dialog: Jonah feels that you're still
text: under a cloud.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Tell her how you don't sleep at
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How do you know that?
text: Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally
text: talking to each other on the phone within their own
text: house, but also ON THE AIR.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: I can hear you walking around
dialog: sometimes. At first I thought
dialog: it was a robber. Go ahead,
dialog: tell her, Dad.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't think I have to now.
text: Sam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts
text: toward him, both of them holding their phone receivers.
text: On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Look, it's almost Christmas --
dialog: (as the two of them sit
dialog: down together on the
dialog: bench)
dialog: A kid needs a mother --
text: He puts an arm around Jonah.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: As Annie listens. She's softened considerably.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Could it be that you need
dialog: someone just as much as Jonah
dialog: does?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes.
text: Annie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm losing my mind.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

dialog: let's just call him Sleepless
dialog: in Seattle, and we'll be right
dialog: back after this break with
dialog: listener response, your
dialog: response, to the things we've
dialog: been discussing. The number to
dialog: call is...
scene_heading: INT. BALDWIN HOUSE
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's she talking about?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: This is where other people get
dialog: to call in and dump on what you
dialog: said.
text: We hear the beginning of a commercial.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio
text: reverie. She goes to the counter to order some coffee.
text: There's a commercial on the radio. The counter WAITRESS
text: LORETTA is talking to the customers -- who include a
text: TRUCK DRIVER at a booth. HARRIET, a short-order-cook,
text: is visible through an open window to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I'll bet he's tall, with a cute
dialog: butt.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: I'll bet he hasn't shaved in a
dialog: week. I'll bet he stinks.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Shut up, Harriet.
dialog: (to Annie)
dialog: What'll it be?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Coffee, please. Black. To go.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Maybe I should hustle myself
dialog: out to Seattle. Give him a
dialog: little present for New Year's
dialog: Eve.
speaker_heading: HARRIET
dialog: You can go there if you want
dialog: but don't open his refrigerator.
dialog: They don't cover anything when
dialog: they put it in the fridge.
dialog: They just stick it in and leave
text: it there till it walks out by
dialog: itself.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Harriet, ever since you
dialog: divorced your last husband,
dialog: you've been no fun. I'm
dialog: looking, and this guy pops my
dialog: tarts.
speaker_heading: TRUCK DRIVER
dialog: Come on, Loretta, you're going
dialog: to have to jump-start this guy.
dialog: His battery's dead. And look
dialog: at me. Mister Ever-Ready.
dialog: Every six minutes, another
dialog: charge.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: I'm looking for someone
dialog: sensitive.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Come on, nobody wants a guy
dialog: who's sensitive on the radio.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Let's take a call before we get
dialog: back to Sleepless. Knoxville,
dialog: Tennessee, you're on.
speaker_heading: SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE
dialog: Yes, I would just like to know
dialog: where I could get this man's

speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Do you think there's somebody
dialog: out there you could love as
dialog: much as your wife? Maybe even
dialog: more?
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: It's hard to imagine.
dialog: And cut back and forth between the car and the
text: houseboat. Sam and Jonah are still on the bench, but
text: Jonah has fallen asleep in Sam's lap. Sam is stroking
text: the boy's hair.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: What are you going to do, Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know. When I met my
dialog: wife, it was so clear. I just
dialog: knew.
text: Annie is listening now.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: What was it that made you know?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't think I could really
dialog: describe it.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And if I could describe it,
dialog: it probably wouldn't be on a radio
dialog: show.
dialog: (he laughs to himself)
dialog: But what the hell. It's not
dialog: one specific thing. It's more
dialog: of a feeling.
dialog: (continued)
text: Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in
text: Washington, D.C., the motor running. She's hooked now,
text: she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You touch her for the first
dialog: time, and suddenly... you're
dialog: home. It's almost like...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Magic.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Magic.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ON ANNIE
text: realizing she has just said this. Realizing that it
dialog: must mean something but not knowing what.
speaker_heading: SHE'S CRYING.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Well, it's time to wrap up,
dialog: folks --
text: A FIGURE appears at the passenger side window, which
text: Annie doesn't notice. She's wiping the tears away with
dialog: her hand.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: We hope you'll call again soon.
dialog: The figure TAPS on the window --
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (muffled, outside car)
dialog: Annie?
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: ... and let us know how it's
dialog: going.
dialog: -- and taps again.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Annie?
text: She turns. He's pointing at the locked door. She
text: searches for the button. Finally finds it so that
text: Walter can open the door.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm sorry, Walter. I just
dialog: heard the most amazing thing on
dialog: the radio.
text: They start toward the front door, Walter and Annie
text: carrying presents, an overnight bag of Annie's.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: People call up these shows and
dialog: you can't believe the stuff
dialog: they say. It's the end of
dialog: privacy as we know it, this
dialog: country is just one big global
dialog: village with everyone out there
dialog: going blah blah blah --
text: As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see
text: a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A CHRISTMAS TREE GLITTERING WITH LIGHTS
dialog: as we pull back to reveal:
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY MORNING
text: As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut
dialog: from gift to gift:
text: A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and
text: which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing
dialog: to open:
text: A TIE which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his
dialog: neck.
speaker_heading: A PLAID SHIRT
text: A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES -- the kind that's used in

text: And now Sam brings out a long narrow present from behind
dialog: the door and Jonah opens --
speaker_heading: A NEW FISHING ROD
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY
text: As Jonah poses with all his Christmas presents -- his
text: tie hanging around his neck over his bathrobe and new
text: plaid shirt, his baseball glove, fishing rod -- as Sam
dialog: takes his picture.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY (OR POSSIBLY EXT. DECK HOUSEBOAT)
text: Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he
dialog: made in woodworking class.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The hopes are perfect --
dialog: beautiful, identical, smooth --
dialog: and they are for something
dialog: really amazing I feel it in my
dialog: bones --
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: It's a spice rack.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We desperately need a spice
text: rack. Desperately.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN OF HOUSEBOAT - DAY
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And we desperately need spices.
dialog: Where Sam is putting the spices they have -- pepper,
dialog: salt, paprika and oregano -- into the spice rack, which
dialog: has room for at least twenty more. Jonah is
text: methodically making pancakes.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Dad? About last night?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's never happening again.
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Right.
text: There's a knock on the door.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Then it never happened.
text: Sam goes to answer the door.
text: TWO YOUNG WOMEN are standing there. Both are wearing
text: quite a lot of Spandex. One of them is named LULU. It
text: says so on her jacket. The other is JOBETH.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: LULU
dialog: Hi. Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: LULU
dialog: (looking in and seeing
dialog: Jonah)
dialog: You must be Jonah.
dialog: Jonah nods.
speaker_heading: LULU
dialog: (to her friend)
dialog: See. I told you. Sam and
dialog: Jonah. I'm LULU. This is
dialog: JoBeth.
text: JoBeth nods, and continues to nod as Lulu talks.
speaker_heading: LULU
dialog: (continues)
dialog: We live two piers over, don't
dialog: we? Number 12, right? We're
dialog: having like a really neat open
dialog: house today from like four to
dialog: whenever if you care to stop
dialog: by.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thanks, but... we've got plans.
speaker_heading: LULU
dialog: Well, here's the number. If
dialog: you ever find yourself
dialog: Sleepless, give us a call. We
dialog: also... do babysitting.
text: She winks. JoBeth nods.
text: Sam nods.
text: Lulu waves goodbye, and she and JoBeth sashay off down
dialog: the dock.
text: Jonah closes the door and turns to Sam.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Not.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: My feelings exactly.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE UNION MARINA - EARLY MORNING
text: Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy.
speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: heard that thing last night?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: It plays in 50 states.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Nobody else is going to know it
dialog: was us.
speaker_heading: SAM

scene_heading: INT. LIFESTYLE SECTION - DAY
text: A large open newsroom-type space with REPORTERS at

text: offices and meeting rooms. Inside one of the offices is
dialog: BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun. She's at a
text: table with Annie, now a reporter for the section, and
text: two other colleagues -- KEITH and WYATT. Wyatt is
dialog: playing Gameboy.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: This man sells the greatest
dialog: soup you've ever eaten, there's
text: a line around the block, and he
dialog: is, I am not kidding, the meanest
dialog: man in America.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I feel strongly about this,
dialog: Becky. This is not just about
dialog: soup.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Do it. What else?
speaker_heading: WYATT
dialog: New Year's Eve. Please don't
dialog: make me write it.
text: Becky looks at Wyatt, notices the Gameboy.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Wyatt, I do not mean to remind
dialog: you of your mother, but if you
dialog: don't put that game away, no TV
dialog: for a week.
speaker_heading: WYATT
dialog: (pushing it to the
dialog: center of the table)
dialog: Would someone look this up,
dialog: don't tell me where.
text: Becky is riffling through some papers on the table,
dialog: among which are some tearsheets from the Associated
dialog: Press wire.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Listen to this. Phone service
dialog: in the greater Chicago area was
dialog: tied up for two hours Christmas
dialog: Eve because some kid called a
dialog: phone-in show to get a wife for
dialog: his father. Two thousand women
dialog: called in for the number.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I heard it. This kid calls up
dialog: and says my dad needs a wife
dialog: and I'm talking to myself in
dialog: the car saying, this is
dialog: completely disgusting, you're
dialog: taking advantage of a child,
dialog: and then the father gets on and
dialog: this shrinkette says, do you
dialog: want to talk about it? And he
dialog: says no as a matter of fact I
dialog: don't, and I am saying, bravo!
dialog: Right on! Don't talk to her,
dialog: it's none of her business --
dialog: (she's completely into
dialog: this story now)
dialog: -- and then suddenly, for no
dialog: reason at all, he's talking
dialog: about how much he loved his
dialog: wife, and how he just --
dialog: (she snaps her fingers)
dialog: fell in love with her and I am
dialog: crying. Me. A tear is
dialog: actually rolling down my face.
dialog: It was like what happens when I
dialog: watch those phone company ads.
dialog: I don't have to see the whole
dialog: ad, I just have to see the part
dialog: where the daughter gives her
dialog: mother a refrigerator with a
dialog: big red bow on it, have you
dialog: seen that one?
text: Everyone looks at her. Apparently she's finished.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: You should write something
dialog: about this.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Whatever it is.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: (waving the AP story)
dialog: What it is is, there are a lot
dialog: of desperate women out there
dialog: looking for love.
speaker_heading: WYATT
dialog: Especially over a certain age.
text: Annie is looking at them. This isn't what she was
text: talking about at all, although she isn't quite sure what
dialog: she was talking about.
speaker_heading: KEITH
dialog: It is easier to be killed by a
dialog: terrorist after the age of 40
dialog: than it is to get married --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: That is not true. That
dialog: statistic is not true.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: It's not true, but it feels
dialog: true.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: There's practically a whole
dialog: book about how that statistic
dialog: is not true --
speaker_heading: WYATT
dialog: Calm down. You brought it up --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: I did not, Wyatt.
text: A beat, everyone pauses. Things are a little out of
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: So where were we?
speaker_heading: WYATT
dialog: New Year's Eve. I'll do it,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: If someone is a widower, why do
dialog: they say he was widowed? Why
dialog: don't they say he was widowered?
text: Everyone looks at her strangely.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I was jus wondering.
scene_heading: EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - DAY
text: Annie walking purposefully, followed by Becky, hurrying
dialog: to catch up.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: What was that about up there?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What was what?
speaker_heading: BECKY

scene_heading: INT. BALTIMORE RESTAURANT - DAY

speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: "Sleepless in Seattle"?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: That's what she called him on
dialog: the show. Because he can't
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: And now 2,000 women want his
dialog: number. The guy could be a
dialog: crackhead, a psychopath, a
dialog: flasher, a junkie, a
dialog: transvestite, a chain-saw
dialog: murderer, or someone really
dialog: sick, like Rick.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Actually, he sounded nice.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Oh? Oh, really? Now we're
dialog: getting down to it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Not.

scene_heading: INT/EXT. REMODEL HOUSE - DAY
text: A hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle
dialog: newspaper, and
dialog: PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
text: Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old
text: house that's being renovated. Jonah, who is playing
text: Cameboy, is walking along with him. WORKMEN are active
text: everywhere. Dry wall going up, cabinets being
text: installed, tile being set.
text: One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him,
text: and JAY MATHEWS, the on-site supervisor, is waiting for
text: them in an unfinished doorframe. Bob is hefty, older,
text: always eating something dietetic. Jay is younger and
dialog: always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather.
speaker_heading: BOB LANGMAN
dialog: Now she wants a circular
text: stairwell off the den.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: (to Jonah, in b.g.)
dialog: Punch me, punch in right here.
dialog: (points to his stomach;
dialog: Jonah punches)
dialog: And she wants the Sub-Zero with
dialog: the side-by-side doors --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Which means --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The cabinets have to be redone
dialog: --
text: They all nod at each other. The woman has been a
dialog: nightmare.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: So we thought --
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Since you're on the make again
dialog: --
dialog: Sam looks at Jonah --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Great. This is great. The
dialog: whole town knows. Just out of
dialog: curiosity, how do you two know?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Grace heard it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Grace the dispatcher. Great.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The point is, take the client
dialog: out to dinner and ask her to
dialog: marry you and then maybe we
dialog: won't have to redo the kitchen
dialog: cabinets.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why me? What about Jay?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Hey, my plate is full.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, okay. What's the big
dialog: deal? If she'll forget the
dialog: new fireplace, I'll marry her.
dialog: Just point me in the right
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Dad, I don't know about this
dialog: one --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, you're changing your mind
dialog: --
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: No, I'm not, but --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's the matter with this
dialog: one? Wouldn't you like to have
dialog: Imelda Marcos as your mother?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Dad --
text: Sam cuffs him good-naturedly.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We better take the measurements
dialog: for the new cabinets.
text: He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc. and
text: starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in
text: another area of the site. Bob follows after him. Jay
text: tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into
dialog: the wall.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sam, if you're not doing
dialog: anything New Year's --
dialog: obviously you're not doing
dialog: anything New Year's -- we're
dialog: having some people over, all of
dialog: them married, not one even
dialog: remotely interested in playing
dialog: around. Does that sound great
dialog: or what?
dialog: (whistfully)
dialog: I can't think of the last time
dialog: I was at a party when anything
dialog: actually happened.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thanks, but I'll pass. It's

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: Does red pepper go under R or

speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: P.

dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (absently)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: I forgot to mention. Jed
dialog: called --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Just out of curiosity, do you
dialog: have any friends whose names
dialog: don't begin with a J? I feel
dialog: like it was a failure of the
dialog: imagination on our part naming
dialog: you Jonah.
dialog: (looking at the spices)
dialog: What is marjoram? Does anyone
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Jed is having a slumber party
dialog: New Year's Eve and he invited
dialog: me.
dialog: A beat.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fine. Fine.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: So I can go.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sure.
dialog: (almost done with the
dialog: spices)
dialog: Looking good.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Shouldn't you have used a
dialog: toggle bolt?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I think I know how to have a
dialog: spice rack.
text: He puts in the last spice.
text: They stand back to admire it. A beat. The rack falls
dialog: off the wall.
text: The rack itself doesn't break, but about six of the
text: glass jars of spices break.
dialog: There's paprika and thyme and currying powder, etc. all
text: over the floor along with shards of glass.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: God fucking dammit! Shit!
dialog: Fuck. Piss.
text: Jonah bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (still angry)
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: (softening)
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: He picks up Jonah and holds him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm just --
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Stressed.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Right. I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm

scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: Can I have half your beer?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sure.
dialog: It's Maggie.
text: She takes his bottle of beer and pours half of it into a
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: What did I used to say? Here's
dialog: looking at you? Here's mud in
dialog: your eye?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Here's to us. You used to say
dialog: here's to us.
text: (he looks at her and
dialog: his eyes well with

dialog: Oh babe. I miss you so much it

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Happy New Year, darling.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Happy New Year.
text: They start to dance.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I was thinking, I have to go up
dialog: to Boston for the AAP
dialog: convention and then visit
dialog: Winston-Hughes about switching
dialog: over our computers. Why don't
dialog: we meet in New York for
dialog: Valentine's Day weekend?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Walter, I'd love to --
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We'll stay at the Plaza --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Go for a walk in Central Park --
speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: We will?

dialog: The Symphony?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll take you to the Russian

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's delicious, trust me.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Does it have wheat in it?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: They go on dancing. It's one of those parties where
text: everyone looks so happy and so in love. Annie, however,
text: looks thoughtful.
scene_heading: ET. MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY
text: Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward

text: In the parking lot is a U.S. MAIL TRUCK.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY
text: Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over
dialog: his face.
text: A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the
text: front door of the houseboat. Jonah is signing a receipt
dialog: for the mail.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Look at this, Dad. They're
dialog: all for you --
text: Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it. It's
dialog: addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr. Marcia
dialog: Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago. He's
text: stunned. As he signs the receipt:
speaker_heading: MAILMAN
dialog: If you're having trouble
dialog: sleeping, you might want to try
dialog: drinking a glass of water from
dialog: the other side.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: I thought that was for hiccups.
speaker_heading: MAILMAN
dialog: Does it work for hiccups?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: For hiccups, a spoonful of
dialog: sugar, you hold it in your
dialog: mouth for a minute.
speaker_heading: MAILMAN
dialog: Really?
text: The mailman starts back toward the mail truck.
text: Sam and Jonah start toward the door.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT
text: Sam is in the kitchen making dinner. Jonah is sitting
text: at the table, reading the letters from the stack they
text: found by the door.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Just out of curiosity, how did
dialog: they get our address?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: They called and asked for it.
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Dear Sleepless in Seattle.
dialog: You are the most attractive man
dialog: I've ever laid ears on."
text: Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of
text: rejects, opens another.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How did they get our phone
dialog: number?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: You have to give them your
dialog: phone number or they won't let
dialog: you go on the air.
text: Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (continues, reading)
dialog: "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I
dialog: am an SWF"--
dialog: (to Sam)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thank God. Something you don't
dialog: know. It's a single white
dialog: female.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: This is no good. She's looking
dialog: for someone French. Or Greek.
dialog: (puzzled, he throws the
dialog: letter into the reject
dialog: pile, opens another)
dialog: "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I
dialog: live in Tulsa." Where is that?
dialog: --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oklahoma. Do you know where
dialog: that is?
speaker_heading: JONAH
text: Somewhere in the middle.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not going to think about
dialog: what they're not teaching you
dialog: in school. I am not going to
dialog: think about it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Generally speaking I think we
dialog: should rule out people who
dialog: don't live somewhere near here
dialog: --
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: She's willing to fly anywhere.
text: As Jonah hands Sam the picture.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She looks like my third grade
dialog: teacher. I hated my third
dialog: grade teacher. Hold it! Wait
dialog: a minute! She is my third
dialog: grade teacher!
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Dad, you're not taking this
dialog: seriously.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is not how you do it.
dialog: (referring to the
dialog: hamburger)
dialog: You want this on an English
dialog: muffin or a bun?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: English muffin. How do you do
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You see someone you like, you
dialog: get a feeling about them, you
dialog: ask them if they want to have a
dialog: drink or --
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: -- a slice of pizza --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: But not dinner necessarily on
dialog: the first date because by the
dialog: time you're halfway through
dialog: dinner you might be sorry you
dialog: asked them to dinner whereas if
dialog: it's just a drink, if you like
dialog: them you can always ask them
dialog: for dinner but if you don't you
dialog: can go home if you see what I
dialog: mean.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I wonder if it still works this
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: It doesn't. They ask you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm starting to notice that.

speaker_heading: JONAH (V.O.)

speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: JONAH (V.O.)
dialog: Will she scratch up your back?
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: As Sam puts Jonah to sleep. Jonah is holding his teddy
dialog: bear while this conversation concludes.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: In the movies women are always
text: scratching up guy's back and
dialog: screaming and stuff. When

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Whose show was this on?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Jed's got cables.
speaker_heading: SAM

scene_heading: CLOSEUP OF: ANNIE, RUNNING

dialog: And another: Your feet are cold.
dialog: And another: Will you find love.
dialog: And another: Before you're cold?
dialog: And another: Burma Shave.
text: And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running
dialog: across a map of the United States -- it's a little like
dialog: the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's
dialog: like the famous map of the United States by Saul
dialog: Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one
dialog: is about Seattle.
text: In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two
text: indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy. They start
text: to wave at her, very slowly.
text: Annie's eyes widen.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Every time I come close to

dialog: make himself a sandwich --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Why don't you make him a
dialog: sandwich beforehand?
speaker_heading: SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: When I met my wife, it was so
dialog: clear. I jus knew.
text: Annie starts at hearing Sam's voice.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: What was it that made you know?
speaker_heading: SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: I don't think I could really
dialog: describe it.
speaker_heading: DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: And if I could describe it, it
dialog: probably wouldn't be on a radio
dialog: show.
dialog: (he laughs to himself)
dialog: But what the hell. It's not
dialog: one specific thing. It's more
dialog: of a feeling.
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You touch her for the first
dialog: time, and suddenly... you're
dialog: home. It's almost like...
dialog: magic.
text: Annie closes her eyes.

scene_heading: INT. ANNIE'S BROTHER TOM'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Annie bursts into Tom's office and walks over to his

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I think I'm going crazy, Tom.
dialog: I really do. Are you happily
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (completely panicked by
dialog: the question)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I mean, why did you get
dialog: married? Was it all fireworks
dialog: and trumpets and --
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (regaining composure)
dialog: I got married because Betsy
dialog: said we had to break up or get
dialog: married. So we get married.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: But when you met her, did you
dialog: believe she was the only person
dialog: for you? That in some mystical,
dialog: cosmic way, it was fated?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Annie, when you meet someone
dialog: and you're attracted to them,
dialog: it just means that your
dialog: subconscious is attracted to
dialog: their subconscious,
dialog: subconsciously. So what we
dialog: think of as chemistry is just
dialog: two neuroses knowing that they
dialog: are a perfect match.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don't even know him. But
dialog: I'm having all these fantasies
dialog: about a man I've never met,
dialog: who lives in Seattle.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It rains nine months of the
dialog: year in Seattle.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I know, I know. I do not want
dialog: to move to Seattle. But what I
dialog: really don't want to do is end
dialog: up always wondering what might
dialog: have happened and knowing I
dialog: could have done something.
dialog: What do you think?
dialog: (Tom opens his mouth to
dialog: say something, but
dialog: before anything comes
dialog: out, Annie fills the
dialog: void)
dialog: It's just cold feet, isn't it?
dialog: Everyone panics before they get
dialog: married, didn't you?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yes, I did.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Thank you, Tom. I feel so much
dialog: better just having blown this

speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: And that's what I'm trying to
dialog: tell you. What women are
dialog: looking over, okay? Pecs and a
dialog: cute butt.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You mean, like, "He has the
dialog: cutest butt"? Where did I hear
dialog: that recently?
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Everywhere. You can't even
dialog: turn on the news without
dialog: hearing about how some babe

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: Seventy... eight.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Well. Things are different.
dialog: First, you have to be friends.
dialog: You have to like each other.
dialog: Then you neck. This can go on
dialog: for years. Then you have
dialog: tests. Then you get to do it
dialog: with a condom.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The good news is, split the

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't think it could let a

speaker_heading: JAY

text: She's sitting at the dining room table. A dozen pieces

text: typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Now those were the days when
dialog: people knew how to be in love.
text: She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right.
text: Becky leans in, refilling the glass. Annie begins to
text: type and sob and look at the TV.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: You're a basket case.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (as she types)
dialog: They knew it. Time, distance,
dialog: nothing could separate them.
dialog: Because they knew. It was
dialog: right. It was real. It was...
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: ... movie.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's your problem. You don't

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: "I am not the sort of person

dialog: shows" --
text: Becky flops on the couch.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: And this woman is a writer!
dialog: That's what everyone writes at
dialog: the beginning of letters to
dialog: strangers.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I know that. You think I don't
dialog: know that? "I know that's a
dialog: dumb way to begin, but it's the
dialog: only way I can think of to
dialog: convey what happened to me the
dialog: other night when I heard the
dialog: two of you on the radio. On
dialog: the other hand, maybe I'm just
dialog: losing my mind."
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: You are. You're losing your
dialog: mind. What about Walter?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm going to marry Walter. I
dialog: just have to get this out of my

speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I should say something in this
dialog: about magic.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don't know. I mean, what if
dialog: I never meet him? What if this
dialog: man is my destiny and I never

speaker_heading: BECKY

speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: You want to hear about destiny?
dialog: If my husband hadn't gone on a

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: JONAH

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Like do you believe in heaven?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I never did. Or the whole idea
dialog: of an afterlife. But I don't
dialog: know any more. I have these
dialog: dreams about... your mom... and
dialog: we have long talks about...
dialog: about you, and how you are,
dialog: which she sort of knows but I
dialog: tell her anyway. So what is
dialog: that? It's sort of an afterlife,
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: I'm starting to forget her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know. But she's here, Jonah.

speaker_heading: WHEEDLE
dialog: It's not a boat boat. It's

speaker_heading: VICTORIA

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: VICTORIA

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Do you believe that any lie is

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I read an article about this

speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I read the same article...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It takes time --
speaker_heading: VICTORIA

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sure. Sure.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Jonah, this isn't fair. You
dialog: don't know Victoria. I hardly
dialog: know her myself. She is, in
dialog: fact, a mystery to me. She
dialog: tosses her hair a lot. Why
dialog: does she do this? I have no
dialog: idea. Is it a twitch? Does
dialog: she need a haircut? Should she
dialog: use barrette so it doesn't
dialog: keep falling in her face?
dialog: These are things that I'm
dialog: willing to get to the bottom
dialog: of, and that is why I am dating
dialog: her. That is all I am doing.
dialog: I am not marrying her. Can you
dialog: appreciate the difference?
dialog: That's what single people do,
dialog: they try people on and they see
dialog: if they fit. But nobody fits
dialog: perfectly, everyone is an
dialog: adjustment.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Was Mom an adjustment?
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There's no such thing as a

dialog: thinks that probably you knew
dialog: Annie in another life.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (completely distracted)
dialog: Who is Annie?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: The one who wrote us.
text: Sam is preoccupied with Annie. She takes a turn that he
dialog: doesn't expect. He's having trouble keeping up, because
dialog: he has to wait for Jonah.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: But Jessica says you and Annie
dialog: never got together in that
dialog: life, and your hearts are like
dialog: puzzles with parts out of them
dialog: and when you get together the
dialog: puzzle's complete.
text: He's lost Annie in the crowd. She's nowhere in sight.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: God dammit.
text: A beat, then Sam heads off to the exit. Jonah follows.

speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: The reason I know this and you

speaker_heading: CLOSE ON ANNIE
