speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY
text: End of the day. An armored truck moves through the city of
dialog: Los Angeles.
scene_heading: EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY
text: The armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges
text: from the back with a satchel and heads inside.
scene_heading: INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: A large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS
text: can be heard from a second floor balcony.
text: DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing
text: the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and
text: dials. Beat. Into phone --
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Last delivery's finally here.
text: The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As
text: he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard
dialog: references the sounds from upstairs --
scene_heading: ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
dialog: Party?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
text: Introducing a new line of jewelry.
scene_heading: ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
dialog: Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring.
dialog: Told her to spend a little time with
dialog: the family jewels first.
text: PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside.
text: Handing over the satchel and heading out --
scene_heading: ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
dialog: Keep it real.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: We see the security guard with the satchel use a key-card to
text: gain elevator access to the lower floors. As the elevator
text: doors slide closed...
dialog: 3.
scene_heading: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: An exclusive showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of
text: the room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to
text: a walk-in vault.
text: The ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges
text: with the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of
dialog: the vault.
text: A man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading
text: the cart into the vault.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY
text: A train arrives. People jostle on and off.
text: One man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser.
text: Carrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap
text: over his shoulder.
text: The train doors begin to close. When...
text: A fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and
text: a man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed.
text: Intense.
text: Fait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They
dialog: check to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the
text: platform into the tunnel and disappear.
scene_heading: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
text: The man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He
text: closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the
text: door, securing the vault.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
text: Fait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to
text: the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high-
text: voltage third rail.
text: Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him.
text: Just before he hits. Inches from the rail. Fait pulls him
text: back up and away from the danger.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Watch yourself.
text: Miles nods.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Keep it tight.
text: Miles nods again, and they set off.
scene_heading: INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
text: Sounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security
text: station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and
text: scans the security monitors.
scene_heading: ANGLE - SECURITY MONITORS
text: depicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various
text: empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man
text: in the suit riding up.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Douglas settles back in with his magazine.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
text: Fait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint. Fait
text: starts to open it.
text: Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an
text: APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall. Press
text: their backs against it as tightly as they can.
text: The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's
text: gone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY
text: Fait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts
text: and rights, following more spray paint.
text: They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the
text: sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a
text: flat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray-
text: painted circle.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Bull's-eye.
text: Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment. Fait
text: pulls out a cell phone.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING GARAGE - (SANTA MONICA) ROOFTOP - DAY
dialog: 5.
text: A man, DUNCAN SU, sits in a rental 2002 Thunderbird.
scene_heading: INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Su's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through
text: HEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music,
dialog: just STATIC.
text: Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even
text: more alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: FAIT (V.O.)
dialog: We're in position.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
text: Delivery confirmed. The stones are
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: FAIT (V.O.)
dialog: Not for long.
scene_heading: CLICK. HISS.
dialog: Su didn't like what he just heard. Curses in Chinese. And
text: takes off.
scene_heading: EXT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Perched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to
text: the park. The top floor is at street level.
text: Su easily gains access to the roof of the building. He
text: moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's
text: an eight-story drop.
text: Su faces in. And then... Hops backward off the roof.
text: Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs
text: onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then
dialog: lets go.
text: Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a
text: sixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto
dialog: the balcony.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 6.
text: A large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away. Nearby,
text: CHRISTOPHE is packing to leave town. When...
speaker_heading: SU (0.S.)
dialog: Where are the stones?
text: Christophe turns. Sees Su standing behind him.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHE
dialog: (French accent)
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
text: Wham. The Chinese boxing version of a bitch-slap.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Who's getting them for you?
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHE
dialog: Fuck off.
dialog: Wham! Wham! Wham! Wham! Much more violent than a bitch-
dialog: slap.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHE
dialog: I'll tell you.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: I know.
scene_heading: INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
text: A plasma torch burns through the metal-reinforced slab
text: overhead. Fait taps Miles, who turns off the torch.
text: Fait hammers at the last layer. And...
scene_heading: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: A hole appears under the private display table, where it
text: can't be seen by the room's security camera.
scene_heading: INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
text: Fait communicates via a high-tech, transmitting/receiving
text: earwig.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Daria.
scene_heading: INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
text: Douglas looks up from his magazine and checks the security
dialog: monitors again. Everything a-okay.
dialog: 7.
scene_heading: ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
text: A limo pulls up outside.
scene_heading: EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY
text: A uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the
text: back and opens the door. A very attractive woman in a
text: short, tight dress emerges.
scene_heading: INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
text: Escorted by the chauffeur, the woman, DARIA, enters. She
text: approaches the security station. Up close, in the light,
text: Daria's even more alluring. And knows how to wield it.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: I'm here for the reception.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Name, please?
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Angie Rawlins.
text: Douglas scans a list of names. Checks off hers.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Thank you. You can go on up. Front
text: elevator, to the mezzanine.
text: Daria turns toward the elevator. Then doesn't go. Just
text: glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: ... I hate these things. Don't you
dialog: hate these things?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I'm just here to do my job.
text: Daria looks back at Douglas. Studies him a moment. Liking
text: what she sees.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Then again, you never know who you're
dialog: going to meet...
text: She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage. Then leans over the
text: desk. Giving Douglas an eyeful.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: 8.
dialog: I'll bet you're a lot more fun than
dialog: any of those boring people upstairs.
text: Douglas is unaffected. Just looks at her blankly.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Really, ma'am. I have a job to do.
text: Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her.
text: Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk.
speaker_heading: DARIA'S POV
dialog: The magazine is Genre. Males for males. Buff boys. Big
text: pecs, big penises.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Daria steps back.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Well, I suppose I should go up and
dialog: see what they're selling.
text: Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Tommy...
text: What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as
text: Daria walks toward Tommy:
text: She whispers into a hidden mike --
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Change of plans. He's gay.
text: Tommy hears it over his earwig.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Yeah way.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
text: Fait and Miles have heard it, too. Into his mike --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Tommy. Your turn.
dialog: 9.
text: A look of alarm on Tommy's face. Into his mike --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Uh-uh.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: This isn't a conversation. Do it.
text: It's an order. Tommy knows he has to. Shit.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Key-card.
text: Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume --
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Why don't you keep my purse? I
dialog: shouldn't be too long.
text: Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him.
text: Then heads toward the elevator, as...
text: Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to
text: look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans
text: over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: ... Aloha.
text: (NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20
dialog: thru 28.)
text: Douglas looks up from his magazine.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I hope you don't take offense at
dialog: this... but I just have such a
text: weakness for a man in uniform.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: If that's your thing...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Uniform's definitely my thing. I
dialog: mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking,
dialog: mmm, seafood. Y'know?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I'm not actually supposed to be
dialog: 10.
text: talking on duty.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Who's talking? Honey, this is a
dialog: flirting... But you're probably just
text: another good-looking man wasting it
dialog: all on women. World's full of fools.
text: Beat. Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have-
dialog: A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the
dialog: pictures of those underfed, white
dialog: males and let's broaden your
dialog: horizons.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and
dialog: I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm
dialog: not too cute for you. And don't tell
dialog: me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll
dialog: come over there and slap a little
dialog: discrimination right upside your
text: yummy little cheeks.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I'm hooked up.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: Another big, hot, cuddly, black love-
dialog: Jesus got there first. That bitch.
dialog: Taking you. From me.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Hey... This day and age, sweetie, I
dialog: can appreciate the monogamy. Saving
dialog: it for your number one is keeping the
dialog: world safe, and it's okay by me.
dialog: Even if you are just breaking my
dialog: heart... Guess I'll just have to come
dialog: in here someday, let you catch me
dialog: shoplifting and resist arrest -- just
dialog: to have you wrestle me down and cuff
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I can be pretty rough.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Don't you get me all excited now. I
dialog: was just learning to accept my
dialog: disappointment.
dialog: 11.
text: Tommy sticks out his hand.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Tommy. But you can call me Rachel.
dialog: Shaking hands --
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Douglas. And, man, I really gotta
dialog: get back to what I'm supposed to be
dialog: doing, okay?
text: He looks away. Scans the monitors.
scene_heading: ANGLE - MONITORS
text: Everything looks normal.
text: ANGLE BACK ON TOMMY AND DOUGLAS
text: Seeing Douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault,
text: Tommy relaxes.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I'll leave you alone. But is it okay
dialog: if I just stand here and stare at the
dialog: muscles I'll be missing for the rest
dialog: of my
dialog: life?
dialog: OFF which...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Daria gets in. Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas's
text: attention. He does.
text: Instead of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the
text: controls to go down.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: who furtively flips her the bird. Never missing a beat with
dialog: Douglas.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
text: Fait emerges from the hole beneath the table.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
text: On the monitors, we see Fait in the vault anteroom and Daria
text: descending in the elevator as Tommy keeps Douglas's
text: attention diverted.
scene_heading: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
text: Fait holds a small digital camera next to the room's
text: security camera. Mimicking the security camera's slow pan,
text: Fait films the room. When he's done....
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - FAIT'S DIGITAL CAMERA
text: We see the panning shot of the room on the monitor. Fait
text: pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks on "Repeat." Whereupon
text: the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous loop.
scene_heading: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
text: As Fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera,
text: Daria steps off the elevator, putting her hair up, ready to
dialog: work.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
text: On the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera
text: slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy
text: continues diverting Douglas's attention.
scene_heading: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
text: Fait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves
text: equipment bags through the hole in the floor.
text: Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three
text: steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a
text: high-tech DRILL. Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault
dialog: door.
text: Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the
text: steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door.
text: Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside.
text: A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the tripod.
dialog: 13.
text: Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had
text: slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal
text: canister of liquid nitrogen.
text: Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound
text: as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault
text: door. The outside frosts over.
text: Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips
text: on the SAM. Final checks of the rig.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Out.
scene_heading: INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY
text: Speeding through L.A. Calling 911 on a cell phone.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: ... I want to report a crime in
dialog: progress.
scene_heading: INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
text: Fait is the last one down through the hole. Beat. He looks
text: at the others.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Faith.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Faith.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Faith.
text: Fait pulls out a remote control firing device. He pushes
dialog: the button. And...
scene_heading: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
text: The SAM IGNITES with a blinding flash and streaks across the
text: room. The steel cables instantly snap taut and... RIP the
text: vault's wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck
text: out of the door.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
text: They felt a rumble. Tommy covers --
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Earthquake.
dialog: 14.
text: Douglas checks the monitors. Everything looks okay.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Bet you know how to hit a ten on the
dialog: Richter scale...
scene_heading: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
text: The crew re-emerges through the floor to find the vault door
text: in pieces and a hole the size of a Sub Zero where the SAM
text: augured into the opposite wall.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Holy shit...
text: Fait's already swinging open the vault.
speaker_heading: FAIT
text: This will trigger the silent alarm.
dialog: Let's go. We got eleven minutes.
text: Miles moves down the rows of drawers, using a tool to pop
text: all the locks. Fait and Daria follow behind, quickly pulling
text: out the drawers and emptying jewels into nylon bags. Fait
text: empties drawer after drawer. All white diamonds. When...
text: He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds. And
text: stops, admiring them.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... I love colored stones... Look at
dialog: this...
text: He holds up a small, faceted blue diamond.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Two-point-seven million.
text: Into the bag.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Whose shit we stealing, anyway?
speaker_heading: FAIT
text: Drug dealers and money launderers.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Works for me.
text: Then something else catches his eye. He holds up a small,
text: pink diamond on a chain. Admires it.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: This I can use.
dialog: 15.
dialog: And pockets it.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: T.
text: Fait moves to her. Daria's fishing into a nylon bag she
text: found in a drawer. Pulls out a handful of... Large black
text: diamonds. Many more in the bag.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Pow.
text: He takes the bag. Stows it in his jacket. When...
text: Suddenly, Fait's CELL PHONE RINGS. Surprising them. Beat.
text: Fait answers.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Go.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY
text: Su's speeding through Los Angeles streets.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Your employer betrayed you. The
text: police are on the way. Leave the
text: black stones.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: You know the ones I mean.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Don't think I'll do that.
text: Fait just hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
text: Tommy and Douglas hear APPROACHING SIRENS. The SIRENS STOP
text: outside. SWAT, cops, the works. All heading for the front
text: door. Tommy whispers urgently into his mike.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Shit. Five-0 at the do'.
dialog: (then, aloud to
dialog: Douglas)
dialog: Better move my car.
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
text: Fait grabs a bag of jewels.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Go time. Leave the rest.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
text: SWAT swarms in.
text: Tommy exits behind them.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LIMO - DAY
text: Tommy gets in. A SWAT COP signals him.
speaker_heading: SWAT COP
dialog: Move it out.
scene_heading: INT. UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY
text: Fait, Miles, and Daria run.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
text: Slam! Fait, Miles, and Daria blast out the access door.
text: Fait kneels, feels the track.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Stopped the trains.
dialog: (then)
dialog: We're in the rabbit hole, they're
text: sending down the snakes.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Daria comes with me.
dialog: (to Miles)
dialog: I got no idea where you should go,
dialog: but you know where to end up.
text: Miles nods.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Faith.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Faith.
scene_heading: INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY
dialog: 17.
text: Su studies a computer map of downtown as he drives.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY
text: running like hell. Rounds a curve. Ahead are the rear
text: lights of a stopped train.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FAIT AND DARIA - DAY
text: Approaching the front of another train, stopped at a
text: station. Fait signals Daria to stay put. Then pokes his
text: head around the corner of the train.
scene_heading: FAIT'S POV - STATION PLATFORM
text: SWAT cops hustle passengers off the train. One SWAT GUY
text: helps another up to check the top of the train. The SECOND
text: COP jumps back down.
speaker_heading: SWAT COP #2
text: All clear.
speaker_heading: ANGLE BACK
text: Fait turns back to Daria. Signals her to climb up onto the
text: top of the train. Then begins climbing after her.
text: As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT
text: COP approaching the train's DRIVER, checking under seats,
dialog: etc.
text: Fait has to climb fast. The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting
text: closer. Looking up. Just as...
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - THEIR POV - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Fait's leg just clears the window. They don't see it.
dialog: But...
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: As Fait rolls onto the top of the train...
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: The NOISE causes the SWAT Cop to react. To the Driver --
speaker_heading: SWAT COP #3
dialog: Hold it.
dialog: 18.
text: A moment, as they stop and the Cop looks around. The Cop
text: checks the Driver's compartment. Nothing.
speaker_heading: SWAT COP #3
dialog: (radios)
dialog: Train's clear.
text: The Cop exits. The Driver enters his compartment.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: ANOTHER SWAT COP stands outside the Driver's window.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Okay to go?
speaker_heading: SWAT COP #4
dialog: Just hang tight.
text: During which, just above them...
text: Fait and Daria lie very still. Daria's tense. Fait winks at
text: her, trying to relax her. Daria's still tense. He raises his
text: eyebrows slightly. Shifts his gaze down.
text: She doesn't get it. Finally follows his gaze. Sees her
text: position is giving him a full view of her cleavage. She
text: looks back at him in disbelief.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Nice.
text: That does it. She relaxes and smiles back. Under which a
text: voice crackles over the SWAT Cop's radio.
speaker_heading: RADIO (V.O.)
text: All clear.
speaker_heading: SWAT COP #4
dialog: (to Driver)
dialog: Okay. Get this train outta here.
text: Whereupon the train jerks to a start.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY
text: running toward the rear of the stopped train. Leaping onto
dialog: the rear steps. When...
text: Out of nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him
text: flying back down onto the rails. And... There is Su in
text: front of him.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: The stones.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: You'll have to come and get 'em.
text: Su moves on Miles. Miles throws a solid punch at him. Su
text: and Miles fight on the track behind the stopped train. The
text: deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous.
text: Miles is a street boxer. He's good. He's ferocious. But
text: he's no match for Su. When Miles is subdued, Su grabs the
text: bag of jewels, makes sure Miles doesn't have any more, then
dialog: goes.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY
text: Rocketing underground. The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above
text: Fait and Daria. Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches
text: from their heads.
text: Every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward
text: the edge. Fait places a calming hand on top of Daria's. The
text: car takes a wide curve.
text: Daria's body flips to the side. She loses her grip.
text: Screams as she starts to fall off the train. Fait reaches
text: for Daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off
dialog: the train.
text: Fait can't grab her. The train jerks again. He starts
text: sliding away from her, off the opposite side. Fait thrusts
text: out both hands as far as he can. And...
text: Just snags her at the last second. Grips Daria's wrists
text: with all he's got. They're now draped across the curved roof
text: of the train. Hands in the middle. If Daria slips, or Fait
text: lets her go, they both die.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL T-BIRD (OUTSIDE SUBWAY ENTRANCE) - DAY
text: Su gets in. Empties Miles' nylon bag into his lap. A
text: fortune in gems and jewelry pours out. Su sifts through it,
text: increasingly agitated. What he wants isn't there. He throws
text: the bag down, cursing in Chinese.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY
text: Fait is at his limit. His grip starts to loosen. When the
text: train begins to slow. They pull into a station and stop.
text: Fait releases Daria, and she drops to the platform.
dialog: 20.
text: Fait jumps down on the other side. He's lost the bag of
text: jewels. Knows they're gone for good. He feels for the bag
text: of black diamonds. Still has them.
text: Unseen, Fait joins Daria on the platform, and, hand in hand,
text: they melt into the crowd of commuters.

text: As Ling descends the steps, and two thugs from the SUV go to
dialog: retrieve baggage...
text: A woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet Ling. She's
text: also Asian. Dressed in American casual. Beautiful. SONA.
text: She's not smiling. As Ling approaches her --
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: Enjoying California?
text: CHARLES, the bodyguard, answers for himself.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hope we're not here long. I hate

text: Ling kisses Sona on the lips. Then --
speaker_heading: SONA
dialog: We may have a problem.
text: Ling's mood quickly darkens.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: The stones?
speaker_heading: SONA

speaker_heading: COP --
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: 21.
dialog: Who's in charge?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Who wants to know?
text: Su flashes I.D. We don't see it. The Cop scopes it a

speaker_heading: COP

scene_heading: INT. VANESSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: VANESSA, eight, is in her pajamas, playing SIM Coaster on

speaker_heading: FAIT

speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Just a little longer.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: (imitating sweetly)
dialog: 'Just a little longer'... School
dialog: tomorrow, baby. Let's go.
text: Vanessa sighs. Fait stands over her as she shuts down the

dialog: doesn't dawdle.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: 'Exit.' 'Quit.' 'Do not save.'
dialog: 'Special.' 'Shut down.' Sleepy-
dialog: time.
text: Whereupon he whisks her out of her chair, flies her once
text: around the room and tucks her into bed.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: You bag some Z's now, you hear?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... Wait a second.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I think there's something behind your
dialog: 22.
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Oh, please, that is so lame. It's in
dialog: your hand.
text: She takes his right hand, opens it and turns it over.
text: Nothing. Takes his left hand, opens it and turns it over.
text: More nothing. She's stumped.
text: Fait smiles. Puts his hands together. When he opens them,
text: there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: How'd you do that?
text: Fait slips the chain over her head and kisses her.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Good night.
text: Then Fait looks up. Addresses the air above her.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Angels east, angels west, north and
dialog: south, do your best. Guard her,
text: watch her, while she rests.
text: A bedtime ritual. Fait goes. When she's alone, Vanessa
text: holds up the diamond, which catches every bit of available
text: light and shines in the dark.
text: Then she rolls over and closes her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. FAIT'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: FAIT

speaker_heading: TONITA
dialog: She won't listen to me lately. Only
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: FAIT

dialog: Still to the nanny --
speaker_heading: FAIT

speaker_heading: TONITA

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What the hell happened?

scene_heading: INT. FAIT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: They enter. Fait shuts the door.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Should we be considering a
dialog: long vacation in a warm,

dialog: no extradition?
text: Fait's thinking it through.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: The guy who called was only
dialog: interested in the black stones...
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Christophe sold us out.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Or something.
text: Just then, Miles enters.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: You made it.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: By the skin of my ass. Some
dialog: Chinese dude kicked me around
dialog: the motherfuckin' block. Busted
dialog: my ear piece.
text: He takes the broken communication device out of his ear and
text: tosses it on the table.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Snagged my loot, too... Maybe time to
dialog: 24.
dialog: rethink the no-gun policy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Little ass-whuppin's nothing. 'Least

text: Fait pulls out the bag of black diamonds.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Means this is all we got.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: So what do we do?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: You all wait to hear from me.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Where're you going?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: To get some answers.
text: Miles moves to go with him.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I got your back.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: No. I got us into this. I'll call

text: Daria moves to him. Their eyes meet.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Be careful.
text: Fait gives her a kiss. Then goes.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTOPHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Christophe's arms are wrapped around the large fish tank,
text: one arm over the top, the other through the legs of the
text: stand. His hands are bound. He can't move. His beaten
text: face is pressed to the glass. Large, weird fish swim past
text: in front of him.
text: The weird fish scatter as a face appears on the other side
text: of the tank. Ling. Looking through at Christophe.
text: Ling straightens and walks around the tank. Sona is with
text: him. So is Charles, the bodyguard. In b.g., the two thugs
text: stand sentry near the front door. Christophe's eyes follow
dialog: them.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: So this is Mr. Christophe?
speaker_heading: SONA
dialog: Yes. Only the handcuffs and fish

speaker_heading: LING
dialog: Apparently we're not his first

speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHE

speaker_heading: LING
dialog: Whatever you're going to say... Make

scene_heading: EXT. ARCHIE'S AMERICAN SURPLUS - M1A1 TANK - NIGHT
text: Sitting in the middle of the large lot, which is full of hot
text: goods and military surplus equipment. The tank's turret is
text: spinning around. The cannon elevating and depressing
text: seemingly at random. When...
text: The cannon stops. Having locked on...Fait, standing in
text: front of the tank. From inside the tank, a muffled voice.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Bang.
text: A hatch opens. ARCHIE, a fairly straight-ahead-looking man,
text: pops his head up out of the tank.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Like it?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: It's cool.
text: As Archie climbs out of the tank and joins Fait --
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Want it? Give you a good deal. Ammo
dialog: included... Reactive armor, twin M240
text: machine guns, 120mm smoothbore

speaker_heading: FAIT

speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: How about a Marine Corps assault

speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I got other business.
text: Fait and Archie walk to a work table. Nearby, two MEN
text: UNLOAD HOT TVS from a truck. One Man calls to Archie.
scene_heading: MAN UNLOADING HOT TVS
dialog: We're outta room over here, Arch.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Stack 'em in the office, if you have
dialog: to.
text: Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: ... You weren't downtown tonight by
dialog: any chance, were you, Tony?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Don't know what you're talking about.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Me either.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Ever see black diamonds before?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
text: White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil
dialog: Diamond. Lou Diamond Phillips.
dialog: Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No.
text: Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black
text: diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup.
text: Studies them a moment. Shrugs.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: You got me.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Find out how much they're worth.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: There a timetable on this, or --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Yesterday.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: That's what I figured.
dialog: 27.
text: Fait's heading out.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I'll be back. I gotta go fuck over a

scene_heading: INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Fait opens a door with an electronic lock pick.
scene_heading: INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Fait enters. Stops a moment, his back against the closed
text: door, while his eyes adjust to the dark. Then moves quietly
text: out into the room. Looking for Christophe.
text: Fait continues moving around through the room. When he
text: steps in something wet. He bends down and checks it out.
text: Water. The carpet's soaked.
text: His eyes go to something. Fait finds a cord and turns on a
text: switch. The light in the fish tank snaps on.
text: REVEAL Christophe. Stuffed inside the tank. Sleeping with
dialog: the fishes.
speaker_heading: SU (O.S.)
dialog: Looks dead to me.
text: Behind him. Fait turns around. Sees Su. Sitting on a

speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Guess you got to him first.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Not me. Someone else.
dialog: Fait does the math.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... You're the one who called me.
dialog: The one who took on my guy... Who the
dialog: fuck are you, man?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: My name is Su.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Cool. I'm Sally.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: I want the black stones.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Yeah? Make me an offer.
dialog: Su stands.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: You can walk out of here.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... No deal.
text: Fait launches himself at Su. Gonna fight his way out the
dialog: door. A much better fighter than Miles. And... He's saved
text: by the bell: the PHONE RINGS. The fight stops. The
text: phone's near Fait. Beat. The answering machine picks up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
dialog: Christophe here. Leave a message.
speaker_heading: BEEP.
speaker_heading: LING (V.O.)
dialog: I know you're there, Mr. Fait.
text: Beat. Fait pushes the button for the speakerphone.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Who's this?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Overlooking L.A. Ling and Sona. Enjoying hotel room

speaker_heading: LING
dialog: The man for whom Mr. Christophe
dialog: arranged to have the black stones
dialog: brought into the country and
text: deposited at the jewelry exchange.
dialog: The man who wants them back. Now.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Fine. How much?
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: Maybe you didn't understand me. The
text: stones are already mine.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I got 'em, I'm selling 'em. So get
dialog: your bid in or go fuck yourself.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: I don't have time for this.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: That your final offer?
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: I can be a very dangerous man, Mr.
dialog: Fait.
text: Fait just hangs up.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Everybody think I'm the fucking
dialog: Goodwill or something...? Look, I've
dialog: had a shitty night, and so far, I got
dialog: zip for all my troubles. So I don't
dialog: know who the fuck you are, and I
dialog: don't care. But hear this: you can
dialog: beat my ass around the block all
dialog: night --
dialog: Brother, it ain't gonna get you those
dialog: stones.
text: A long beat. The two men facing off. Then...
text: As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET NEAR CHRISTOPHE'S - NIGHT
text: Fait slides into his Porsche and drives off.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
text: Fait's checking his rearview mirror. Sees a black Cadillac
text: Escalade pull away from the curb and follow.
dialog: Fait doesn't need it.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Oh, man...
text: He's about to punch it. When... A cop car turns a corner
text: and falls in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps
text: driving. Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now...
dialog: Fait hits it. Until...
text: Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi-
text: industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow,
text: but is cut off by the on-coming cars.
text: We STAY WITH Fait. He GUNS down the alley. Reaches an
text: intersecting alley. Turns. GUNS it out of sight.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and
text: speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the
text: intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled
text: into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a
dialog: wall.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY (SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Two men start to get out of the Escalade. We recognize
text: them: Ling's two thugs. We barely have time to realize
text: that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction
text: equipment down the alley. He's had no choice but to turn
dialog: and fight.
text: Which is what he does, rushing the passenger.
text: The battle's ferocious and fast. Ultimately, Fait's out-
text: muscled and out-gunned. He's forced back against the open
text: door of the Escalade, guns to his head.
speaker_heading: LING THUG #1
dialog: Give us the stones.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Man, how many times I gotta tell
dialog: people: I'm a business man. Make me
text: a motherfucking offer.
speaker_heading: LING THUG #2
dialog: Here's your offer.
text: He cocks his pistol. Beat.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: That shit ain't gonna do it, biggie.
dialog: 'Cause I ain't scared of guns, and I
dialog: ain't got the stones.
speaker_heading: LING THUG #1
dialog: Then you're gonna tell us where they
dialog: are.
dialog: Whereupon a...
speaker_heading: BOTTLE
text: Spins through the air. The bottle knocks the gun from one
text: Killer's hand. The gun skids under a nearby chain-link
dialog: fence.
speaker_heading: REVEAL
text: the person who threw the bar. Su. The fight's on. Two on
dialog: 31.
text: two. Using all means available. During the battle, a killer
text: tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence. Almost
dialog: gets it. When...
text: Two vicious DOBERMANS, guard dogs for the junkyard behind
text: the fence, leap out of nowhere, SNARLING and SNAPPING and
text: smash into the fence. The killer jumps back, barely
text: escaping with his arm.
text: The fight continues. Fait and Su wear them down.
dialog: Behind the fence, the Dobies want flesh. Every time someone
text: crashes into the fence, they're right there trying to get a
dialog: piece.
text: Also, every time someone crashes into the old fence, we see
text: a series of chain-link connections loosen and break. Until
text: it happens one too many times. The entire fence goes down.
text: The dogs are out. The nearest targets: Su and Fait.Su and
text: Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and
text: evading the ferocious attack dogs.
text: Finally, Su kicks one dog flying. Whip-kicks the other off
text: Fait. The two men run for the Escalade. The dogs are up in a
text: flash. Su spots an abandoned car. A rear door is open.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Over here.
text: Fait follows, right on his heels.
text: The dogs close in.
text: Su reaches the car. Dives through the open door.
text: Somersaults over the rear seat. Kicks open the far door and
text: rolls out. Fait dives in right behind him. The Dobies leap
dialog: in after Fait.
text: Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the
text: other side of the car. Clears the door. And... Su slams
text: the door shut.
text: We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed
text: door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that
text: door, too. Trapping the SNARLING, foaming DOGS inside.
text: The bad guys are gone. And Fait's CELL PHONE is RINGING. As
text: Fait digs out the phone, to Su --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Man, what the hell's up with these
dialog: fucking stones?
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Go.

dialog: Faith...
dialog: (hangs up)
dialog: Maybe Chambers'll have a heart and
dialog: give the stones back.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Yeah, right -- and maybe he'll join
dialog: the Peace Corps.
text: Su looks over. Beat.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: I'm sorry about your daughter... How
dialog: old is she?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: This ain't the Biography Channel.
dialog: Let's just get there.
text: A long beat. L.A. moving by outside.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Eight. She'll be nine in September.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: 39.
dialog: Mine is fifteen... Boyfriends...
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Never happen. I'll just kill
dialog: 'em.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: I wish it were that easy.
dialog: Another beat. Then --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: About time I got the 4-1-1.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: 4-1-1?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: What's this all about?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: The stones aren't what you think they
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: No shit.
dialog: (then)
dialog: How about the guy who has Vanessa?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: He's exactly what you think he is --
text: a thief and a killer.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Great...
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
text: A battered Ford camper now sits in the middle of the hangar.
text: We see Vanessa inside the camper. She's screaming. Loudly.
dialog: Not scared. Pissed. As...
text: Ling Thug #2 covers the windows with black spray paint.
scene_heading: ANGLE - ACROSS HANGAR
text: Ling Thug #2 hands car keys to Charles.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Where'd you get that piece of shit?
speaker_heading: LING THUG #1
dialog: Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa
dialog: have a long walk back from the
dialog: 40.
dialog: campground.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You're sure you cleaned it out?
speaker_heading: LING THUG #1
dialog: Everything except the denture cream
text: and adult diapers.
text: Vanessa's still screaming. It's getting on Charles' nerves.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm sick of her already.
text: He marches toward the van. Unlocks the rear door and slides
text: it open.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Vanessa is standing inside, still yelling.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: You shut up!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Go to sleep!
text: Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV. Turns
text: it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as...
text: Charles slams the door shut. Locks it. And...
text: Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her
text: anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on
text: the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark
dialog: camper.
text: Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it.
text: A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the
text: fear go away, but giving her strength.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - FAIT
text: As he drives, just as if he can sense Vanessa's need for him
dialog: --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Angels east, angels west, north and
dialog: south, do your best. Guard her,
text: watch her, while she rests.
dialog: 41.
dialog: OFF which, as Su regards him...
scene_heading: INT. MEDIUM SECURITY PRISON - CELLBLOCK - DAY
text: A prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as
text: dreary, spare and institutional as the next. That is, until
text: they reach the last cell.
text: The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries. Hanging
text: blankets cloak the cell entirely from view.
text: Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside the cell. One
text: sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets
text: covering the open cell doorway, REVEALING...
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CHAMBER'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The
text: last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as
text: Joel's office.
text: JUMP CHAMBERS, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime
dialog: lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the
dialog: terms of his incarceration.
text: Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS,
text: sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs
text: benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries;
text: French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ, Maxim, Hustler
dialog: and the daily mail.
text: The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns to go.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Metz.
text: The guard, METZ, stops and looks back.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
text: D.V.D.'s broke.
speaker_heading: METZ
dialog: Get you a new one straight away, Mr.
dialog: Chambers.
dialog: Metz goes.
text: Beat. Chambers eyes Fait and Su through his cigar smoke.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Thanks for your patience. Man needs
dialog: his nightly rest.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Who's the gook?
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... Chinese guy.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: ... No shoes in my crib.
text: Then, when Fait and Su have removed their shoes --
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: In.
text: The sentries move aside. Fait and Su enter. Chambers ash-
text: trays his Cuban and digs into b-fast.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: How you doing, Jump?
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Don't waste my precious time.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... I got a problem.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: How's Daria?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... Good.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Always was good. From the moment I
dialog: found her till the moment you took
dialog: her away from me. Problem, you say?
speaker_heading: FAIT
text: ... The black stones.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Bitch brought it in. Made me a lotta
dialog: money. But that all stopped. You
dialog: stopped that. You decided it was
dialog: okay to put an end to that. Black
dialog: stones. Go on.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I need 'em back.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Only smart thing was not pimping her
dialog: yourself, 'cause then I'da been real
dialog: sore-angry, and you'da both been real
dialog: cold-dead...
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
dialog: But you don't pimp, do you? Just a
dialog: 43.
text: thief in the night. Stealing what
dialog: don't belong to you.
text: Chambers turns to Su. In SUBTITLED KOREAN --
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: You like tall white women?
text: Su doesn't say anything. Back to English --
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: He can't talk?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: I don't speak Korean.
text: Chambers carves up a sausage.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Bought myself this Korean club
text: downtown. Packing in the Seoul
dialog: brothers 24-7-365... Black man
dialog: gouging Koreans, ain't that a
dialog: switch... Motherfuckers got faces
dialog: like walls, but they love to drink
dialog: liquor and look at naked girls...
dialog: Place is no shitbox, either. Got me
text: an office looks like a kabuki love
dialog: palace. My own little sanctuary --
text: A QUICK SHOT OF Fait, taking this in.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: -- just waiting for when I parole
dialog: out... Stop by sometime, eyeball the
dialog: poon.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... Jump, my daughter's mixed up in
dialog: this. I gotta have the stones, or
text: she's dead.
text: No response. Chambers just keeps eating.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: If you need something more than that,
dialog: here it is...
dialog: (this is hard)
dialog: I'm begging you, Jump.
text: Still no response... Chambers finishes eating. Wipes his
dialog: face. Finally --
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Big heist. Risky heist. Breaking
dialog: news. I'm watching it wondering why.
dialog: 44.
dialog: What's worth that kind of trouble,
dialog: that kind of heat? Gotta be
dialog: something good. Gotta be something
dialog: expensive.
text: Beat. He meets Fait's eyes. Holds them.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: She's my little girl.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Make another one... Lotta offspring
dialog: running around. Big scores're rare
dialog: in a lifetime.
dialog: Another beat. That's it. No deal.
text: Fait takes a sudden step toward Chambers. Su stops him.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Slope's no dope.
text: He indicates behind them. They turn. The two cell sentries
text: are wielding prison shanks. So is Willy Chickens.
speaker_heading: CHICKENS
dialog: Let me cut one of these
dialog: motherfuckers.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Your choice.
text: Chickens is happy. Thrusts the knife at Fait. When...
text: Su reaches out and catches the blade. Catches it with just
text: the thumb and forefinger of one hand. And holds it like
dialog: that. Holds it hard. Chickens can't push and can't pull.
text: Doesn't know what to do next. Finally yanks really hard.
dialog: And...
text: Su lets go. Chickens goes backward, ass over teakettle. A
dialog: beat. Then, to Fait --
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Say hey to Daria. And don't forget
dialog: your shoes.
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON - DAY
text: Fait and Su walk toward the Porsche.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I used to look up to that guy. All I
dialog: wanted was to be like him.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: In Taiwan, I could force him to talk.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: This ain't Taiwan.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Only thing we can do now is find out
dialog: where the stones are and go take 'em.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: You make it sound easy.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: It won't be.
text: They're about to get in the car. Fait stops. Looks back at
text: the prison. Suddenly realizing something.
speaker_heading: FAIT
text: ... They're at his club.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I know. I can feel it. That ever
dialog: happen to you?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I thought Chinese people were all
dialog: mystical and shit.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: We like to gamble. Not guess.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: It's no guess... But I could be
dialog: wrong... We'll hit the club. You
dialog: gotta see Archie.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Archie?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: He's gotta remember something about
text: the guys who took down his place.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: What if he can't?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Pretend it's Taiwan. Make him
dialog: remember.
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR - DAY
text: RUSSELL, the science and technology end of Ling's operation,
text: carries a piece of equipment from the back of a five-ton
text: truck and approaches some kind of strange contraption, which
text: he's in the process of erecting in the middle of the hangar.
text: He puts down what he's carrying next to the contraption and
text: starts back for something else, when he sees Charles is
text: looking in the back of the truck.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Hey! Get away from there!
text: Russell hurries over, extremely edgy, almost manic.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Whoa. Take it easy. Just seeing if
dialog: I could help with something.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: You can't! It's very delicate
dialog: equipment! Stay away! Just stay
dialog: away from my truck!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Stay away from my truck!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Stay away from my truck!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What?
text: Sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby.
speaker_heading: SONA
dialog: Stop it.
text: Charles does. And now we can hear Vanessa, who's begun
text: screaming inside the camper.
speaker_heading: VANESSA (O.S.)
dialog: I want my daddy!
text: Charles backs up, continuing to address Russell --
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm backing away... I'm backing
dialog: away...
speaker_heading: VANESSA (O.S.)
dialog: I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
dialog: Charles joins Sona. Re: Russell --
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Someone give the geek his Ritalin.
speaker_heading: SONA
dialog: At least he's doing his job. Which
dialog: is more than I can say for some
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: VANESSA (O.S.)
dialog: I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
text: Sona tosses Charles a roll of duct tape.
speaker_heading: SONA
text: Tape her up and gag her.
text: As Vanessa continues to SCREAM, Charles moves to the van,
text: unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it.
text: Then opens the door. And...
text: Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his
dialog: waist.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I want my daddy! I want my daddy! I
dialog: want my daddy!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Get the hell off me.
text: He pries loose her arms from around him. Keeping a grip on
text: her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face
text: away from him. He's about to start duct-taping her wrists.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ... Waste of time... I can think of a
dialog: better way of shutting you
dialog: up --
text: Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads. Charles howls in
text: pain and lets her go.
text: Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
dialog: 48.
text: Vanessa slams the sliding rear door shut. And now... We
text: suddenly realize she has the key and remote! The crying
text: just an act she put on to pickpocket Charles. Vanessa pushes
dialog: the remote. And...
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: THUNK go the DOOR LOCKS. Charles, still in pain, is
text: surprised to hear this. Feels his pocket. Realizes the key
text: and remote are gone.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Shit.
dialog: (yells to Sona)
dialog: She got the key!
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Vanessa climbs into the driver's seat. Puts the key into
text: the ignition and STARTS the ENGINE. Puts it in "D."
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - ACCELERATOR PEDAL
text: To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal. An
text: extension for her short legs. As her foot tromps down on the
dialog: can...
speaker_heading: ANGLE - CAMPER
text: takes off. The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't
text: see where she's going. But she's going.
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: The camper careens around the large space. Charles
text: scrambles after.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Vanessa keeps driving blind, pedal to the metal.
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: The CAMPER veers toward the rear wall. And...
text: ... CRASHES into a support post.
text: As Charles yanks Vanessa from the wrecked van, unhurt...
dialog: 49.
scene_heading: INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
text: A hostess bar, but very high-end. Beautiful women. Elegant
dialog: decor. Pumping MUSIC. No strip-club cheese. For extra
dialog: money, private rooms for private pleasures. It's day, but
text: the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men.
dialog: Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility: at the
text: door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc.
text: ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through
text: the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door.
speaker_heading: ODION
text: Delicious Daria.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: 'Sup, Odion?
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: Long time no see.
dialog: Then, checking her out --
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: Like cognac. Just getting better.
dialog: (then)
dialog: So what brings you around?
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: ... Sometimes you need an old friend,
dialog: y'know?
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: Got trouble?
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: ... With a capital 'T.'
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: Tony Fait? Thought you and him were
text: tight. Bonnie and Clyde.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Used to be that way. Not treating me
dialog: right these days. The kid's all he
dialog: cares about.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: ... What do you want me to do?
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: ... Man, I don't know. Probably
dialog: nothing you can do. I just
dialog: 50.
dialog: thought...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Hey, y'know, this is crazy. I don't
dialog: know what I was thinking. I
dialog: shouldn't even be here like this.
dialog: Sorry, Odion.
text: Daria starts to go. Odion stops her.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: Nah, hey, hold up. It's okay.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Back in the day... Just always seemed
dialog: like you and I had something special
dialog: between us.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: Didn't know you thought so.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: I always cared for you, Odion.
dialog: That's why I'm here.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: ... You looking for a job?
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: I need something.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: ... So maybe you could work here.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Here?... Oh, man, I don't know.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: You were the best. Not many girls
dialog: pulling in two g's a night.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Yeah, but it's been a while for
dialog: that... Might not remember how.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: Just like a bicycle, baby. You don't
dialog: forget that stuff.
text: Daria considers it a moment.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Don't know how Jump'd feel about it.
dialog: Having me back.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: Hey, you let me worry about Jump,
dialog: 51.
dialog: okay?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Meantime, why don't you come on in,
dialog: and you and me can, y'know, talk some
dialog: more about it.
text: Beat. Daria knows the look in his eyes. Gets the subtext.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: ... Just talk?
text: Odion's drinking her in.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: ... No.
text: A beat. Then, as Daria reaches out and slips her hand into
text: Odion's, smiling at him --
scene_heading: INT. SU'S T-BIRD - DAY
dialog: Su and Archie.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: They have boxing matches in the day?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Not exactly boxing. More dangerous.
dialog: No gloves. No rules. Big money.
dialog: Very illegal... Started holding 'em
text: during the daytime to fool the cops.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: The man you remembered -- how do you
dialog: know he will be here?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: I don't. But Chambers owns the
dialog: operation, so I figure it's a good
dialog: place to start.
dialog: (then)
dialog: This is it.
dialog: They turn into...
scene_heading: EXT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: A cavernous industrial building. Cars parked on the

scene_heading: INT./EXT. SU'S T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION
dialog: As they park --
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: How will you recognize him?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: I didn't see his face. But I'll know
text: his pinkie ring when I see it. Ten
text: carats. Round cut with square mount.
dialog: Good color and clarity. I remember
dialog: thinking what it would do to my face
dialog: if he hit me.
text: OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to
dialog: help disguise himself...
scene_heading: INT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Archie and Su exit the car and approach a GUARD manning a
text: gate to the fight arena beyond.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: How do we get in?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Leave that to me.
dialog: Then, to the Guard --
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Hey, man, how you doing? Got a
dialog: fighter here I want to enter.
text: Su shoots him a surprised look.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: My man's gonna put the rest of these
dialog: bums to beddy-bye. He'll go in there
dialog: and get all Chinese on 'em -- the
dialog: teeth are gonna fly, the blood's
dialog: gonna run... Gonna be fun.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Whatever... You're number twelve,
dialog: Bruce.
text: He hands a card reading "12" to Su. As Archie and Su make
text: their way toward the arena --
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: I didn't come here to fight.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: You won't have to. That was just to
dialog: get us in.
dialog: 53.
text: They reach the arena. It's also huge. Packed with men.
text: Hazy with smoke. Loud with betting, cheers and boos.
text: A large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room.
text: Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the
dialog: shit out of each other.
text: Like at a Gallagher concert, front row fans have sheets of
text: plastic over their laps. Whenever a hard kick or punch
text: lands, the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to
text: shield themselves from flying blood.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Good day, over a million dollars'll
dialog: pass hands in here.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Find the ring.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Yeah. Okay.
text: He looks around. Lotta African-American males.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Could take a little while.
text: As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands,
dialog: and Su follows...
scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
text: Daria and Odion enter, and Odion closes the door. He starts
text: to take her in his arms. Daria slows him up. Guides him
text: back toward a sofa.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Sit down.
text: Odion sits.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Put on some music.
text: Odion puts a DISC in the STEREO. Cranks up some HIP-HOP.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Nah. Something slower.
text: Odion SWITCHES MUSIC. A SLOW TUNE fills the room.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: That's good... Now just relax... And
dialog: watch...
dialog: 54.
text: Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the
text: music. Then starts dancing for him. Slow and sexy.
dialog: And Odion's eating it up.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

speaker_heading: TOMMY

scene_heading: EXT. KOREAN CLUB - STREET IN FRONT - DAY

text: spray hose from the truck and advance toward the door.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Hey. Howzit?
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: What the hell you doing?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Pest control. Don't tell me you

speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: What notice?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: See, that burns my ass right to the
dialog: bone. I mean, hey, I'm here doing my
dialog: job... Anyway, putting that aside, if
dialog: you had gotten your notice, you'd
dialog: know there's a new city ordinance
dialog: saying all businesses catering to
dialog: foreigners gotta be sprayed.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Yeah? How come?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: 'Cause foreign people're bringing all
dialog: 55.
text: their scary-assed foreign bugs over
dialog: here. Y'know, in their luggage and
dialog: shit. And then the bugs're getting
dialog: loose and fucking everything up --
dialog: eating all the trees and everything,
dialog: y'know, making people sick... Anyway,
dialog: city says we gotta spray to prevent
dialog: any infestation and possible spread.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: We're doing business inside. Can't
dialog: let you just start hosing the place
text: with bug spray.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Yeah, well, maybe you should at least
dialog: ask the manager about it.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Manager's busy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: ... Okay. Your call. Just know the
dialog: city quarantine people'll be here
dialog: first thing tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Quarantine people?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: They'll be shutting you down for non-

speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Wait, wait, wait.

speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: City's really gonna come and close us

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Quicker'n a Zip-loc.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: ... You sure you're not fucking with
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I'm a licensed exterminator. Why
dialog: would I be fucking with you?
text: The Doorman considers it another moment. Then --
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Look. Let's do this. You let me
dialog: start with a couple small rooms,
dialog: y'know, offices or something,
dialog: someplace you don't have customers.
text: Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother
dialog: anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug
dialog: bombs, and then we'll do the rest
dialog: later. How's that?
text: The Doorman considers a moment. Then --
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: ... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and

scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

scene_heading: INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
dialog: What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a
dialog: normal office. No expense spared. (Think Joel again.) A

text: The door opens. The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around
text: in amazement.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: ... Look. At. This.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Just do your thing and go,
dialog: bro.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Roger that.
text: He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT. He sets off

text: Where the BUG BOMBS HISS away.
text: Fait tries the WINDOW. Locked shut. He quickly tapes it.
text: BREAKS it. He and Miles climbs inside. Grab the bug bombs
dialog: and toss them out.
text: As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls out
text: a folding metal detector. Uses it to scan the entire room
text: quickly: floor, walls, ceiling... Gets LOW-VOLUME RING-OFFS
text: from various hidden metal. But he's looking for something
dialog: bigger.
text: BLEEE. He gets it when he sweeps past Chambers' big desk.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Safe.
text: He kneels. Removes a desk panel. And...
text: There it is. The safe is small but highly secure.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Take it down.
text: Miles finishes assembling a Barrett .50 caliber rifle. A
text: big gun. Opens an ammo box labeled "Depleted Uranium. .50
dialog: cal."
scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
text: Daria's down to bare essentials -- still dancing slow and
dialog: sexy for Odion.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
text: Miles loads one of the massive D.U. cartridges into the
dialog: Barrett.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Even with the music, they're gonna
dialog: hear it when I fire this tank buster.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Daria. Get ready to move.
dialog: (then)
dialog: 58.
dialog: Do it.
text: Miles aims the BARRETT directly at the safe lock. Miles
scene_heading: FIRES. BIG BANG.
scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
text: Odion starts.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: What was that?
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
text: Basically, the lock's just gone. Melted. Burned through by
text: the DU slug. Fait swings the safe door open.
scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Odion's heading out the door. When he stops. Looks back at
text: Daria. A realization dawning.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: 'Sometimes you need an old friend'...
text: He steps toward Daria. Backhands her. Hard. Then opens
text: the door.
text: A CHAMBERS MAN outside the door addresses Odion.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS MAN
text: It came from the office.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: Watch her. Don't let her leave.
text: Odion goes. The Man enters. Shuts the door, leering at
text: Daria, who starts putting on what she's taken off.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
text: Fait's tossed the safe. No stones.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Not here?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: They're here. Somewhere else.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What're you talking about?
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I'm telling you, they're here.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What're we gonna do?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Everyone out.
text: Fait's started searching the room. Tearing it apart.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I gotta save Vanessa. I gotta find
dialog: 'em.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: I'm not leaving you.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Yes, you are. Go. Now.
text: Someone starts RATTLING the LOCKED DOOR. Fait doesn't stop.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: T. Come on, man. They're outside.
dialog: Give it up.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Shut up and get the fuck outta here!
dialog: That's an order!
text: Miles hesitates. Fait's unreachable. Chambers' men are
text: trying to break down the door. Miles goes. Out the window.
text: Onto the ascender-descender. And gone.
scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Daria finishes dressing. When...
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS MAN
dialog: ... Y'know, I got the big one...
text: Her response is a front kick to the head. Followed by a
text: spin kick, knocking him out. Then, stepping past him --
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Keep it in your pants.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
text: CRASH! Odion and his men break down the door.
dialog: 60.
text: Fait's still searching. Desperate to find the stones.
text: Desperate to save his daughter. He fights off the first
text: men to reach him. A wild animal. Fights off another. And
dialog: then...
text: The guns are out. All pointed at Fait. No stones. No exit.
scene_heading: INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
text: Daria walks out the front door.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY
text: Willy Chickens hovers near Chambers, who is talking as he
text: eats another meal. Lobster. At first, we don't realize who
text: Chambers is addressing.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: ... If you're willing to pay five,
dialog: you're willing to pay ten.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
dialog: You're willing to pay ten, you're
dialog: willing to pay twenty. Twenty,
dialog: forty. Forty, eighty... I'm not
dialog: selling till I know exactly where the
dialog: ceiling is.
text: Whereupon we see who he's talking to: Ling.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: You like foreplay?
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: How much money do you want for the
dialog: stones?
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up
dialog: drills -- girl's gotta get in there
dialog: and be ready to score points. Bring
dialog: it straight to the motherfucking
dialog: hoop. You understand?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, instead of us going back and
dialog: forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for
dialog: you to think of a number. A very
dialog: high number. A very final number. A
dialog: number so high and final it'll get me
dialog: off good, bam, right when I hear it.
text: Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time. Still isn't
text: looking. Forks up some lobster meat. When...
dialog: 61.
text: Chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him. And...
text: Ling slams a lobster claw deep into Chickens' neck. Chambers
text: doesn't wait for whatever's next. Jumps back. Fast for a
dialog: big man.
text: But Ling is much faster. Stronger. Deadlier. Quickly, and
text: quietly beats Chambers like a drum. Chambers knows when it's
text: finally tent-folding time. Croaks surrender through the
dialog: blood and swelling --
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Okay, okay...
text: Ling stops.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERS
dialog: Ain't worth my life... I'll take the
dialog: five and call it a game.
scene_heading: INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE CHAMBERS' CELL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ling emerges from the cell through the blankets. Closing
text: the blankets behind him. To the sentries, who've heard
dialog: nothing --
speaker_heading: LING
text: Mr. Chambers is resting. He says not
dialog: to bother him.
text: OFF which, as Ling walks away...
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY
text: FIND Chambers. No one will bother him. Ever. The lobster
text: fork driven deep into the base of his skull.
scene_heading: INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
text: Archie still looking for the man with the diamond
text: pinkie-ring. Su still following.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: ... By the way, when we do find him,
dialog: what then?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: I'll handle it.
text: In the cage, a fight has just ended. The loser's
text: unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning
text: airplane propeller. The winner doesn't look much better.
dialog: 62.
text: The midget RING ANNOUNCER steps in with a mike.
speaker_heading: RING ANNOUNCER
text: Seven advances, eleven's out...
dialog: Next up, eight versus twelve. Eight
dialog: versus twelve. Fighters report to
dialog: the cage.
text: As Archie and Su continue the search --
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: You're after the stones, too, huh?
dialog: No response from Su. Beat.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: ... I did some more checking around
dialog: to see what anyone knows about 'em...
dialog: Guess who get back to me? My Defense
dialog: Department connection. Now, I think
dialog: he's calling me about this surplus F-
dialog: 14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands
dialog: on. But no. Turns out he's calling
dialog: to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan
dialog: about black stones --
text: In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the
dialog: midget calls out --
speaker_heading: RING ANNOUNCER
dialog: Number twelve!
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: (to Su)
dialog: -- only they're not jewels --
speaker_heading: RING ANNOUNCER
dialog: Number twelve!
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: They're --
text: Suddenly, seeing the "12" card in Su's hand, a FIGHT CLUB
text: FAN grabs his arm and raises it. Yells out --
speaker_heading: FIGHT CLUB FAN
dialog: Twelve's right here!
text: Su pulls his arm back.
speaker_heading: FIGHT CLUB FAN
dialog: I'd be scared of him, too.
text: Su glances into the ring, seeing the BRUISER for the
text: first time. The Bruiser's beckoning.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: BRUISER
dialog: Let's go, chickenshit!
text: Su waves them off.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Not today...
text: The catcalls start. Archie leans into Su.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: I know it wasn't the plan. But if
dialog: you don't fight, they're gonna toss
dialog: us out on our asses. We might never
dialog: find the guy.
text: A long beat. Su hates this place. Su hates Archie.
scene_heading: INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
text: Fait's in handcuffs. A big cut on his head. Being escorted
text: by two COPS to the stairs leading out of the club. To
text: Odion, as they pass him --
speaker_heading: COP #1
text: He's pretty beat up.
speaker_heading: ODION
dialog: Yeah. Fell down the stairs... Enjoy
dialog: the jail sex, Fait.
text: As they continue up the stairs --
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: Better have the E.M.T.s look at his
dialog: head.
scene_heading: EXT. HOT DOG STAND (NEAR KOREAN CLUB) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Near, but not too close. The club visible in b.g. Daria,
text: Miles, and Tommy watch as Fait is led into an ambulance.
dialog: Via earwigs --
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: We're still here to help you, T.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Anything you want us to do?
scene_heading: INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
dialog: Fait's heard.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: 64.
dialog: Not yet.
text: The PARAMEDIC treating him doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - BEHIND FAIT'S BACK
text: His cuffed hands. Fingers feeling the inside of his belt.
text: Finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the
text: leather. Popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed-out
dialog: recess in the belt. Where...
text: Fait has a hidden handcuff key.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - ANOTHER SET OF HANDS
text: struggling against their duct-tape bonds. REVEAL...
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - DAY
text: Vanessa's hands are taped together behind her back. There's
text: tape around her feet. Tape over her mouth. The TV is ON
text: nearby, but she's not watching.
text: Vanessa struggles a moment longer, but can't break the tape.
text: Finally gives up trying. Just lies there. Tired and
dialog: scared.
scene_heading: INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
text: DING! The crowd's yelling and betting as number eight
text: leaves his corner and advances on Su.
dialog: Su has nothing against number eight. He's just trying to
text: buy time. So he dodges his opponent. Not exactly
text: running. Fighting by not fighting. A target one moment,
text: gone the next. Again and again, number eight swings and
dialog: misses. Until...
text: Number eight delivers a knockout blow. Unfortunately
text: it's against himself. The momentum of a missed punch
text: carries him headfirst into a metal post.
text: Number eight drops. As the referee counts over number eight,
dialog: Su uses the chance to find...
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
text: still checking out the hands of African-American men in
text: the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it.
speaker_heading: SU
text: Number eight's on his feet. Moving in again. When...
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
text: Suddenly, he sees it. The ring.
speaker_heading: SU
text: dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling
text: he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A
text: solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight.
text: Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: You win.
text: Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its
text: disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's
dialog: path.
speaker_heading: RING ANNOUNCER
dialog: No quitting. Get back in there.
text: Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting
text: fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the
dialog: cage. Where... It's now Su against them all.
scene_heading: HOT DOG STAND - DAY
text: Daria, Tommy and Miles wait. Two extreme MOTO-RIDERS
text: dressed in leathers have pulled up in a truck and gotten out
text: to eat. In the back of the truck is a motorcycle and a
text: four-wheel ATV. The two men Ogle Daria. To her --
speaker_heading: MOTO-RIDER #1
dialog: Looking good.
text: She ignores them. To each other, so she can hear --
scene_heading: MOTO-RIDER #2
dialog: Nice rack.
speaker_heading: MOTO-RIDER #1
dialog: Like the upstairs, like the basement,
dialog: 66.
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Shut up, assholes...
scene_heading: INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Fait's heard. Looks past the Paramedic. Past the Cops
text: talking outside. Sees the hot dog stand in b.g. Sees the
text: truck with the motorcycle and ATV parked near the stand. The
text: Paramedic finishes bandaging Fait. To the cops outside --
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
text: He's all patched up.
text: A Cop calls inside to Fait.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: Let's go.
text: Fait stands. Starts out. Into his mike --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Get ready to move.
dialog: And we see...
text: The handcuffs aren't on him anymore.
scene_heading: EXT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Fait reaches the rear doorway. When...
text: He jumps. Knocks one Cop down. Shoves another aside. And
text: takes off running.
text: Fait's caught the cops completely by surprise. It takes a
text: few moments before the cops give chase, some on foot, others
dialog: by car.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand.
text: To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Get the car. Stay close.
text: As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into
text: the bed of the truck. Jumps on the ATV. IGNITION.
text: The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: MOTO-RIDER #1
dialog: Hey!
text: Too late. Fait blasts out of the rear of the truck. Right
text: through the nylon mesh tailgate.
text: Fait flies from the truck bed. Lands on the hood of a
text: police car. Gets big air off the windshield. Clears the
text: rest of the car and grabs pavement with all four wheels.
text: As Fait tears off, and cop cars follow, one of the Moto-
text: Riders jumps into the bed of the truck and climbs aboard the
text: remaining motorcycle. His friend calls to him --
speaker_heading: MOTO-RIDER #1
dialog: Don't let that fucker get away!
text: The Moto-Rider FIRES UP the MOTORCYCLE. Drops it into
text: first. Dittoes Fait's leap out the back and SCREAMS off in
text: pursuit.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - DAY
text: Vanessa still taped up. TV still ON. When...
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
dialog: ... We go now to this breaking
dialog: story...
text: ANGLE TO INCLUDE TV
text: Airing a chopper shot tracking Fait on the ATV.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
dialog: ... You're watching a man on an all-
text: terrain vehicle leading police in a
text: high-speed chase through downtown Los
text: Angeles. An L.A.P.D. spokesman says
dialog: the man, Anthony Fait --
text: Vanessa looks over in surprise.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
dialog: -- commandeered the A.T.V. after
text: escaping from police officers while
text: being treated at a local hospital for
dialog: injuries resulting from his earlier
dialog: arrest for robbery... And this is
dialog: certainly one of the wildest chases
dialog: we've witnessed here in L.A...
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
dialog: 68.
text: WHOOOM! Fait's flying. Seventy-plus. Down streets,
text: sidewalks, squeezing through places police cars can't.
text: Over, under, around, through -- doesn't matter. The ATV's
text: fast, strong and maneuverable.
dialog: One problem: so is the moto-cross bike. The guy's right on
text: Fait's ass. Matching move with move.
text: Overhead, police choppers follow Fait's every move. While
text: on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path.
text: But whenever Fait meets a roadblock, he somehow finds an
text: escape. At one point, he uses an outdoor escalator. At
text: another point he blasts through the Hotel Bonaventure.
dialog: This'll be a news highlight for days to come.
scene_heading: INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
text: The place is bedlam. In the crowd, bets are going down on
text: the battle royal, now in full effect inside the cage. Su
text: versus the five fighters. And the midget.
dialog: The different fighters use different fighting styles against
dialog: Su. Kickboxing, grappling, aikido, kali, American street
dialog: fighting...
text: Su uses all his own skills and whatever's at hand. At one
text: point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another
text: opponent. At another point, Su wields the midget like a
dialog: fighting staff.
text: One by one, Su starts reducing the opposition.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
text: Fait's everywhere. And so is the moto-bike. Still on his
dialog: tail.
text: Fait veers inside a building. The bike follows.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING - VARIOUS SHOTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs. One floor. Two
text: floors. Up and up.
text: Fait reaches the top-floor hallway. Nowhere left to go
dialog: except...
text: Out the window at the end. And...
dialog: That's just where he goes.
dialog: 69.
text: And where he goes, the moto-bike goes.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS
text: The ATV and the moto-bike make the first leap. Onto the
text: roof of a next-door building.
text: From there, it's rooftop to rooftop. Jump after jump.
dialog: Longer and longer. Until...
text: The MOTO-BIKE eats it in a spectacular CRASH. The moto-
text: rider walks away, but his chase is over.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
text: Fait's ATV SCREAMS down another street, still chased by
text: cops. Into his mike --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Yo.
scene_heading: INT. DARIA, MILES AND TOMMY'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY
speaker_heading: DARIA

speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Know it.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Get there.
scene_heading: INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
text: It's down to Su and the kick boxer. The kick boxer spins
text: and kicks and punches, and...
text: Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes. Ties him into a
text: pretzel. Cinches him tight. Then...
text: Looks for Archie. Can't find him. Can't find the guy
text: wearing the ring. And hurries out of the cage.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
text: Fait jukes the ATV in the entrance. Up the spiral ramp.
dialog: 70.
text: Moments later, police CARS SKID up and seal the entrance.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - DAY
text: On TV, a chopper shot of the garage surrounded by police.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
dialog: ... And it looks like this chase will
dialog: end here, as police seal off the
dialog: building...
text: OFF Vanessa, watching...
scene_heading: INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
text: Su runs into the parking area. Archie's in the T-bird.
text: Sitting, a little unnaturally in the front.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Decided to leave early.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Where'd he go?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Right here.
text: Su looks inside the car.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - CAR
text: Where Archie sits atop the man with the diamond pinkie ring.
text: Holding a STUN GUN to the guy's cheek.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Good thing I brought my stunner.
text: He ZAPS the air. Then puts it back to the guy's cheek.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Okay, bud, wanna start the Q and A?
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - DAY
text: On TV, the chopper zooms in on a familiar car, as it rolls
text: down the exit ramp toward the police barricade.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
dialog: ... Here's a car coming down the exit
dialog: ramp...
text: We see the police approach the car.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
text: ... The police apparently talking to
dialog: the driver...
text: The police let the car pass.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
dialog: ... Now letting this car drive on as
text: the search inside continues...
text: Vanessa notices something about the car. Looks carefully.
dialog: When...
text: The car turns, giving the news chopper a better zoom angle
dialog: of the people inside, and...
text: Vanessa sees Daria, Miles and Tommy.
dialog: Which could mean only one thing: her daddy's safe. And
dialog: soon he'll be coming to get her.
text: With a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape,
text: Vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct-
text: tape bonds. When, just as it's about to seem hopeless
text: again, her eyes go to...
text: Her necklace. The chain and pink diamond pendant.
text: Vanessa bends over and lowers her head until the necklace
text: slides off onto the bed. Then turns around and picks up the
text: necklace behind her back. Holding it as taut as she can
text: between her hands, she begins sawing away at the tape around
text: her wrists.
scene_heading: EXT. NEAR KOREAN CLUB - HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT

speaker_heading: FAIT

speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: No Chambers' guys. I don't get it.
text: They reach the closed office door, where they stop and
dialog: listen. Hear nothing.
text: Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look. Then Su opens
text: the door.
scene_heading: INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Su and Fait enter, unchallenged, to find...
text: Odion and the other Chambers' men. Dead. Skull shot.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I get it now.
text: Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain,
text: where he reaches into the water and begins searching the
text: rocks lining the bottom. Beat. Then --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Are they there?
text: Su doesn't answer, still searching.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: No. This can't fucking happen. They
dialog: gotta be there.
text: Another beat. Then, at last, Su holds something up: one
text: black stone. It takes Fait a moment to understand.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... What? That's it?
speaker_heading: SU
text: The rest are gone.
text: Fait can't believe it.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... What the hell happened? Who got
dialog: 'em?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: ... Ling.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... How'd he get here before us?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: He's good.
text: Beat. Failure. Summed up in one word:
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Vanessa...
dialog: (then, trying)
dialog: He has the stones. There's no reason
dialog: to keep her. Hell, she's a little
dialog: girl, she's eight years old -- she
dialog: can't hurt him. He can let her go...
dialog: He can just fucking let her go...
text: Su just looks at him. Not a chance. And he knows Fait
dialog: knows it, too.
text: It's over. For Fait, it's as if his life just ended.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... What the hell am I gonna do?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: ... We need to go.
text: Fait doesn't move. Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage,
text: and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the
text: fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of
text: exotica, destroying it.
text: Beat. Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes. Then --

scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
text: Vanessa succeeds in using the necklace as a saw to free her

text: next. Begins searching the camper for anything that might help
dialog: her escape or fight. When...
text: Looking through the glove box, she finds a cell phone. An

text: The only noise is Su, speaking into a cell phone in Chinese
text: to someone who is obviously his superior.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: ... I lost the stones. Ling has
dialog: them... I don't know where he is... I
dialog: have no way to find him... What do
dialog: you want me to do?
text: Under which, the PHONE begins to RING. And...
text: Fait's too upset to care about answering.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
text: Vanessa's on the old cell phone. We hear RINGING on the
dialog: other end.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: ... Answer, Daddy, answer...
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - PHONE
dialog: "Low Batt"... "Low Batt"...
scene_heading: INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The PHONE'S still RINGING. After another moment...
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Want me to get that?
text: Which finally mobilizes Fait to reach over and answer.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Hello.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
text: Vanessa whispers urgently.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Daddy?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Vanessa!
text: Which gets everyone's attention.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Come get me! Please! I want to go
dialog: home!
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Okay, baby, okay. Just calm down.
text: Under which, in b.g., Su quickly ends the phone call to his
dialog: superior. Still in Chinese --
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: I'll call you back.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: (continuing, to
dialog: Vanessa)
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
text: I don't know. I'm in a van inside a
dialog: big building. They painted the
text: windows. I can't look out.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Try. Try to see something.
text: Vanessa puts her eye to the window. Finally finds a small
text: gap in the paint.
speaker_heading: VANESSA'S POV
text: Few details. Just some chairs and bright green light from
text: Russell's contraption.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - VANESSA'S PHONE
dialog: "Low Batt"... "Low Batt"...
text: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
text: I see chairs. And there's green
text: light.
text: Fait repeats for the others' benefit.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: You see chairs and green light?
dialog: Where's the light coming from?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: I can't tell.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Is it bright?
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: The green light, baby -- is it
dialog: bright?
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Yeah. Really, really bright.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: (to Su)
dialog: It's real bright.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Daddy, hurry! I'm scared!
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: I know, baby. Just hang in there
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - VANESSA'S PHONE
text: Fait's voice drops out as the battery dies.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: ... Daddy?! Daddy?!...
scene_heading: END INTERCUT.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... Vanessa?... Vanessa!... Shit!
text: Fait slams the phone down in frustration.
text: But Su's mind is on what she told them.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: ... He's doing it here. Tonight.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Selling the stones... A dye laser
text: emits green light. He needs it to
dialog: activate them.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: What the hell you talking about?
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: What are these stones?
text: Archie answers it.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
text: Doomsday in disguise.
text: All eyes go to him.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: They're some kinda new synthetic
text: plutonium. Small and portable, but
dialog: mega-powerful.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: This fucker's making bombs?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Not making them.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Yeah, he'd need a big operation for
dialog: that. Why bother? Just demonstrate
dialog: the stones work and sell 'em to
dialog: whichever international scumbag
text: offers the highest bid. He makes
dialog: millions, they make the bombs,
dialog: then... 'look out, world.'
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... Okay, so we know what he's up to.
dialog: How's it get us to Vanessa?
text: Su considers it a moment.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: The buyers will want to arrive and
dialog: leave quickly... Somewhere private...
text: Accessible by aircraft.
speaker_heading: FAIT
text: Vanessa said she's inside a big
text: building. Could be a hangar.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Man, there's dozens of little
dialog: airports around here. We'd never get
dialog: to 'em all.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: ... Flight plans.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Hey, yeah. Flight plans show
dialog: destinations. All aircraft file 'em
dialog: with the Aviation Administration. If
dialog: we could get a list, we could maybe
dialog: figure out where the sale's going
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... Daria, call the aviation people.
dialog: Use our L.A.P.D. credentials. We
dialog: need flight plan info for all private
dialog: aircraft in this area tonight...
dialog: Everyone else get ready to move...
text: Miles, the no-gun policy's revoked.
dialog: You break out the heat... Tommy, you
dialog: gotta get us a diversion.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: I can help with that.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... Do it all fast.
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
text: Ling, Sona, Charles, and Russell.
text: Russell finishes testing his contraption. Switches it OFF.
text: Then, removing his goggles --
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: We're operational.
text: The others remove their goggles. Sona checks her watch.
speaker_heading: SONA
text: The buyers arrive in less then an
dialog: hour.
text: Beat. Ling holds up a black stone and examines it.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: ... So small. So deadly... We're
dialog: selling conscience for money...
text: A look at the others. Serious. Then a broad smile of
dialog: 80.
text: consummate satisfaction suddenly spreads across his face.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: ... But it's a lot of money...
text: Beat. He puts down the stone. A glance at the camper.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: Be ready to kill the girl and go as
text: soon as the sale's over.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF LOS ANGELES AREA
text: Fait's finger indicates a spot.
speaker_heading: FAIT (O.S.)

text: PULL BACK TO...
scene_heading: INT. FAIT'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Fait, Su, Daria and Miles.
speaker_heading: FAIT
text: ... Five private choppers arriving
text: tonight within minutes of each other.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Sounds like our best shot.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: .. It better be, or my baby's dead.
text: He and Su exchange a look. Then --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Let's go.
scene_heading: CORPORATE HELICOPTER - NIGHT
text: Noselight beaming, the chopper lands next to four other
text: high-end biz copters, including an Agusta A109, outside the
text: hangar, where the bruised Ling killers stand guard.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
text: Vanessa peeks through a void in the paint covering the
dialog: windows.
speaker_heading: VANESSA'S POV - HANGAR
dialog: 81.
text: An internationally-diverse group of men -- some occupying
text: the chairs, some studying the contraption, some clearly
text: muscle. Across the room, Sona and Ling greet the new
text: arrivals.
text: In all, sixteen men have arrived for the sale. There are
text: five buyers -- one RUSSIAN, one AFRICAN, one PAKISTANI, one
text: EGYPTIAN, one FRENCH. The French Buyer is in a wheelchair.
dialog: Each buyer has brought with him one right-hand man and one
text: to three bodyguards.
text: Vanessa SHIFTS her VIEW, REVEALING...
text: Charles standing nearby. Too close for her to escape.
text: Charles turns, and...
dialog: BACK TO VANESSA
text: Quickly, before Charles can see her, she steps away from the
dialog: window.
dialog: There's no way out.
scene_heading: EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
text: Driving. Daria and Miles following in their car.
speaker_heading: FAIT (V.O.)
dialog: So tell me... How the hell's Taiwan
dialog: fit into all this?
speaker_heading: SU (V.O.)
dialog: One of our scientists made the
dialog: stones. Tried to go into business
dialog: for himself. We stopped him.
text: Recovered the stones... Ling betrayed
dialog: us. He took them.
speaker_heading: FAIT (V.O.)
dialog: Ling? He was one of you?
speaker_heading: SU (V.O.)
dialog: We were partners. Six of us. He
dialog: killed the others. He thought he
dialog: killed me, too.
speaker_heading: FAIT (V.O.)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So what're you really after -- the
dialog: stones or the payback?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: 82.
dialog: Both.
speaker_heading: FAIT (V.O.)
dialog: ... Yeah... Let's get it all.
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: You're the world's foremost arms
dialog: dealers. You all know that weaponry
dialog: equals power. And in the world of
text: weaponry, nukes rule.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: LING (CONT'D)
dialog: But nuclear material is hard to
dialog: obtain and difficult to handle... But
dialog: what if it weren't?... That's the
dialog: question that brought you here
dialog: tonight... And here's the answer.
text: Ling holds up a single stone.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: In its present state, it's completely
dialog: inert. Zero radiation, zero
dialog: volatility...
text: Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a
text: table. Folds the velvet over. Then, whack, hits it hard
text: with a mallet.
text: He unfolds the velvet. The stone's smashed to pieces.
text: Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who
text: places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then
text: inserts the capsule into his contraption.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
text: Goggles on.
text: Everyone puts on goggles. Then Russell hits the switch, and
text: the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver
text: of stone, which begins to glow.
text: Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical
text: readout on the contraption races up the scale --
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: ... Firecracker... .44 magnum...
text: R.P.G... Sidewinder... SCUD...
dialog: Tomahawk... Daisy Cutter...
dialog: Hiroshima... two Hiroshimas...
dialog: And it just keeps going. Until, finally --
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: ... New World Order.
dialog: As the buyers absorb this...
text: Russell shuts off the beams.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
text: Goggles off.
text: Russell removes the capsule and hands it back to Ling, who
text: holds it up.
speaker_heading: LING
text: One small fragment. Transformed into
text: a source of immense energy. More
dialog: powerful than weapons-grade plutonium
text: a hundred times its size.
text: A beat as this sinks in.
speaker_heading: SONA
dialog: The purpose of today's sale is to
text: begin trading a new commodity on the
dialog: black market and establish its
dialog: value... There are fifty stones
text: available in the first sale. The
dialog: opening price is one million per
dialog: stone... Bids, please?
text: The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand
text: signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. At the
text: same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators.
text: Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a
dialog: laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market-
dialog: analysis for Sona to consult.
text: The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel
dialog: out the situation.
speaker_heading: RUSSIAN BUYER
text: Five at one million.
text: Sona is silent. Silence means "No."
speaker_heading: AFRICAN BUYER
text: Five at one-point-two.
dialog: Silence.
scene_heading: PAKISTANI BUYER

speaker_heading: SONA

dialog: via earwigs.)
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Miles, what do you see?
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD - ROOF
text: Atop the building next to Ling's hangar. The five choppers
text: rest on the wide tarmac below, between the two buildings.
text: Miles scans Ling's hangar through the scope of a silenced
text: sniper rifle.
scene_heading: SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NO NIGHT VISION
text: FINDING the Ling killers outside the hangar.
speaker_heading: MILES (V.O.)
dialog: Two sentries my side.
text: Then, scanning inside Ling's hangar THROUGH windows --
speaker_heading: MILES (V.O.)
dialog: Sale's at this end... There's a
text: camper with painted windows. Middle
dialog: of the hangar.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD - FAIT AND DARIA
speaker_heading: FAIT
text: Vanessa said she was in a van.
dialog: That's gotta be it.
dialog: (to Daria)
dialog: When we get her, you move her outta

dialog: there fast.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: I'll keep her safe.
scene_heading: EXT. HANGAR
text: Su's reached the top of outside stairs. Opens a door and
text: enters.
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: High above the floor, Su steps onto a catwalk. The sale

speaker_heading: RUSSIAN BUYER
text: Eight at three.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: FRENCH BUYER
text: Nine at three.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: EGYPTIAN BUYER
text: Ten at three-one.
speaker_heading: SONA
dialog: We'll take that... There are now

speaker_heading: AFRICAN BUYER
text: Five at three-five.
scene_heading: PAKISTANI BUYER
text: Eight at three-five.
speaker_heading: FRENCH BUYER
text: Twenty at three.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD - FAIT AND DARIA
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Miles. Sentries.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: is already sighted in. PULLS the TRIGGER. PHUT!
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: SENTRIES
text: One Ling killer takes a leg hit and goes down.
text: Before the second killer has time to react, he catches a
text: BULLET in the shoulder.
speaker_heading: MILES
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: FAIT AND DARIA
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Tommy and Archie. Watch out for the

scene_heading: INT. HANGAR

scene_heading: PAKISTANI BUYER

speaker_heading: FRENCH BUYER
dialog: Five-two.
dialog: When suddenly...
text: KA-WHAM! Archie's Abrams TANK BLASTS through a wall and
text: into the hangar.
text: Archie's head pops out of the driver's hole. At the same
text: time, Tommy pops up out of the turret and trains a mounted
text: machine gun on the stunned group.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Freeze, motherfuckers!
dialog: 87.
text: Russell watches the advancing tank.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: I knew it! I knew it!
scene_heading: ANGLE - BEHIND TANK
text: Fait and Daria enter through the hole in the wall using the
dialog: Abrams for shelter.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Vanessa peers out through a gap in the paint to see what's
dialog: happening.
speaker_heading: VANESSA'S POV
text: Charles is drawn away by the advancing tank.
dialog: BACK TO VANESSA
text: She looks back into the camper. Finds a heavy iron skillet
text: amid the stove utensils. Swings it. And...
text: SMASH! She SHATTERS a side WINDOW.
scene_heading: MILES' SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
text: We FIND Vanessa, jumping out of the camper.
speaker_heading: MILES (V.O.)
text: Vanessa's out of the camper. Running
dialog: this way.
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR - FAIT AND DARIA
dialog: To Daria --
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Stay.
text: And he's gone, sprinting after her just as...
speaker_heading: VANESSA
text: reaches a button for opening and closing the giant hangar
text: doors. She jabs a button, and the nearest door begins to
text: motor open.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: hears the OPENING HANGAR DOOR. Turns. Sees Vanessa and
text: goes after her.
scene_heading: SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
text: Vanessa rolls out under the rising door and runs.
speaker_heading: MILES (V.O.)
dialog: She's out.
text: Then, FINDING Charles coming after her --
speaker_heading: MILES (V.O.)
text: There's a guy after her.
speaker_heading: PHUT!
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR - CHARLES
text: A BULLET rips through the collar of his leather coat. Just
text: behind his neck. Just missing him. But he keeps coming.
scene_heading: SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
text: Charles rolling out under the door.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: SHOOTS again. PHUT!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: The BULLET RICOCHETS off the PAVEMENT right next to him. In
text: a flash, he's up and running. Heading out into the darkness
text: of the airfield after Vanessa. Meanwhile, back inside...
scene_heading: INT. HANGAR
text: In here, the hangar door continues to open as the tank makes
dialog: its slow approach. Archie's not a great driver. Tommy
text: sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Just be cool!
text: At which point, Russell breaks for his five-ton truck.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I said don't move, motherfucker!
text: Russell just keeps going. Slides open the side door in the
text: back of the five-ton, revealing... A twin-fifty machine gun.
text: Two barrels, .50 caliber. Dangerous even for a tank.
text: Russell vaults in and takes aim.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Fucking amateurs!
text: He starts FIRING. People start running. .50 CAL. ROUNDS take
text: big CHUNKS out of whatever they hit.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Shit! What do we do?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Shoot back!
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: How?
dialog: The question's answered for him. He somehow does the right
dialog: thing. And...
text: Tommy's MACHINE GUN begins RIPPING CHUNKS out of the FIVE-
text: TON and EVERYTHING near it. Tommy's a horrible shot; the
text: gun's more in control of him. But...
text: Russell finally dies under a HAIL of HEAVY LEAD.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
text: Twin .50's some major firepower.
dialog: How'd that little shit get one?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Motherfucker. Couldn't fucking
dialog: listen.
dialog: INTERCUT WITH which...
speaker_heading: ACROSS HANGAR
text: Ling and Sona are moving toward the limo. Ling has the
text: stones. When... Su is there. Blocking the way. Sona
text: attacks. Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back.
text: Never taking his eyes off Ling. When...
text: Sona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly
text: takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns
text: the gun on Su.
text: Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd
text: just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su... Su sees
dialog: 90.
text: Ling getting into the limo. To Archie and Tommy, as he
dialog: signals --
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Don't let him get away!
dialog: As a result of which...
scene_heading: TOMMY AND ARCHIE
text: Having just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo. Tommy's .50
text: is out of ammo. He switches to the .30 cal. tank's machine
text: gun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins BLASTING
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: LIMO
text: Ling's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH
text: HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as
text: the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO.
dialog: INTERCUT WITH which...
speaker_heading: SU AND SONA
text: Play cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out of room to hide.
text: He can't get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the
dialog: inevitable. When...
text: WHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from
text: Sona's hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed
dialog: limo
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: Get him.
text: Su goes after Ling.
dialog: And now it's Daria vs. Sona.
dialog: Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her
text: side. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the
text: Scorpion. She swings it up. And...
text: Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes
text: Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the
text: SCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips
text: through her chest and kills her.
dialog: And now, here's what's been going on outside...
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD
dialog: 91.
text: As Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the
text: tarmac into the darkness of the airfield...
speaker_heading: MILES
text: flips to NIGHT VISION on the sniper-scope. And...
scene_heading: SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
text: Charles and Vanessa become clearly visible. Charles is
text: closing in on her. Cross-hairs FIND him. PHUT!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: The BULLET knocks his gun from his hands. Charles is slowed
text: but keeps going.
scene_heading: SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
text: Charles reaches the flight line. Parked planes, a gas
text: truck, a shed, etc. He disappears behind the equipment.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and Vanessa. He comms
dialog: Fait.
speaker_heading: MILES
text: Lost 'em behind the gas truck.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: stops behind the gas truck. Looks around for Vanessa. No
dialog: sign of her. Until...
text: Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all
text: the way. He whips it open. And...
text: There's Vanessa, hiding inside.
text: Charles grabs her. Yanks her out struggling and kicking.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Time to end this my way.
dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: FAIT (O.S.)
dialog: Drop the girl.
dialog: 92.
text: Charles looks over. Fait is there, holding a gun on him.
text: Vanessa's relieved and excited to see her father.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Put her down.
text: Charles lowers Vanessa to the ground. He releases her.
speaker_heading: VANESSA
dialog: Daddy!
text: Vanessa runs to her father. Dives into his arms. It's a
text: little more energetic than Fait was expecting. And...
text: Suddenly, Charles uses the distraction to rush in behind
text: her. He hits Fait hard. A kick sends the gun flying.
text: Charles keeps coming. Charles keeps pounding.
text: Fait's hampered by Vanessa. She won't let him go. Fait
text: stays between Charles and Vanessa. Guarding his little
text: girl. Barely managing to fend off Charles, a seemingly
text: unstoppable force.
text: The fight winds through the planes, under wings, through
text: struts.
scene_heading: SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
text: Fait, Charles and Vanessa. No clear shot.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: comms Fait.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: No shot.
scene_heading: FAIT, CHARLES AND VANESSA
text: The fight continues. Fait's suffering under Charles' brutal
dialog: attack. When...
text: Vanessa causes Fait to stumble near a plane. They fall.
dialog: Charles moves in. And...
text: Fait's hand goes to a set of chocks set against the plane's
text: wheel. The chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by
text: a length of nylon rope.
text: Fait turns to Vanessa.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Don't move.
text: Fait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite
text: like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of
text: Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat
text: the living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight
text: back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion.
text: The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until...
text: A mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is
text: unconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over
text: Charles. Tosses the chocks down.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Wrong kid. Wrong dad.
text: Fait turns. He moves back to where Vanessa's still hiding.
text: He scoops her up. And... Father and daughter hold each
text: other tight. Forever. During all of which, also INTERCUT...
scene_heading: EXT. HANGAR
text: Ling, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs
text: out just as... Four helicopters take off, one after the
text: other, carrying the buyers away.
text: The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting
text: for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a
dialog: bodyguard.
text: Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips
text: over the Frenchman's chair. Then jumps into the Agusta.
scene_heading: INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT
text: Ling puts a gun to the pilot's head.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: Go!
scene_heading: EXT. HANGAR
text: Su, having left Daria to fight Sona inside, runs out.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD
text: The Agusta begins to lift off. Su starts running toward the
text: helicopter. Runs under the rising aircraft. Jumps. Just
text: in time to... Grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels.
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: EXT. AGUSTA
text: As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to
dialog: get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the process,
text: he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly.
scene_heading: INT. AGUSTA
text: Ling hears the THUMPS. Looks out.
speaker_heading: LING'S POV - SU'S LEG
text: swinging beneath the Agusta.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: To the pilot --
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: Retract the gear!
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - CONTROL PANEL
text: The pilot hits the wheels-up switch. And...
speaker_heading: SU
text: The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into the bottom of
text: the chopper. In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: Shoot it down! Now!
text: And then... Su lets go. Drops fifteen feet to the ground.
dialog: As...
text: Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams
text: tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta.
scene_heading: INT. TANK
text: Archie aims the cannon.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Can you hit it?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: No problem. Absolutely... Load.
text: Tommy slides a shell into the breech.
dialog: 95.
text: Archie's locked on. He hits the trigger. And...
speaker_heading: ABRAMS TANK
text: BOOM! The big CANNON FIRES. And...
speaker_heading: SKY
text: The Agusta's tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON SHELL.
scene_heading: INT. TANK
text: Archie and Tommy exult.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Shot him right in the ass.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: I did it. I can't believe it.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Thought you said it was no problem.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: What do I know?
scene_heading: INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT
text: The pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from
dialog: crashing.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD
text: The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the
text: hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac,
text: ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it
text: caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle
text: around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING
text: INTO FLAMES.
text: The spilled fuel ignites. A circle of intense fire. With
text: Su in the middle.
text: The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the
text: circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside.
text: Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones.
text: Su is waiting.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: 96.
dialog: You were lucky last time. You
dialog: Won't be lucky again.
text: The final fight begins.
text: The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire,
dialog: using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the
text: equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death.
dialog: For a long time, the fight could go either way. Until...
text: Ling gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes
text: and flails. Like Charles, he can't get away.
speaker_heading: LING
dialog: I'll kill you fast. You won't
dialog: Feel a thing.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: ... I won't. You will
text: What happens next happens in an instant:
text: Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms. Wrenches it.
dialog: A direction it can't go.
text: Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP.
text: Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic
text: Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from
dialog: Ling's pocket. And...
text: Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags,
text: choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror-
text: stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment.
text: Then, in SUBTITLED Chinese --
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: This is for our friends.
text: And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand
text: blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that...
scene_heading: INSIDE LING'S THROAT
text: The CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS. Releasing the hot, glowing
text: white sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe. The fragment's
text: super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook
text: Ling's body from within. The power of a few thousand
text: microwave ovens turned on all at once.
text: Ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as...
text: ANGLE BACK ON LING
dialog: 97.
text: As, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, Ling flash-cooks
text: from the inside out.
text: Not simply burned. Horribly desiccated. His seared and
text: darkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his
text: skeleton. Human jerky.
text: In a moment, it's finished. Ling's dry-roasted remains
text: topple over. Su has closed a chapter.
scene_heading: SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Su and Fait meet on the tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait's
text: holding Vanessa, asleep in his arms. SIRENS APPROACH in
dialog: b.g.
text: The two men regard each other a moment.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: We got it all.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What happens to the stones?
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: They'll be destroyed.
text: They see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive
dialog: in b.g.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Looks like I'll be doing some jail
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Jail? Man, you just helped save the
dialog: planet. Law's gotta allow for that.
text: A look between Fait and Su. Su nods.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: I'll do what I can.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: That's good, 'cause I mean, we make a
dialog: helluva team, y'know?
dialog: (to Su)
dialog: Well, not you, 'cause you're law
dialog: enforcement. But the rest of us
dialog: -- look, a white guy comes in handy
dialog: now and then. Y'know, if you're
dialog: pulling a job in Beverly Hills or
dialog: ripping off a country club or
dialog: whatever... What kind of percentage
dialog: are we talking?
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: We're not.
text: Fait looks at Vanessa again. Finding a new purpose in her
text: eyes. Beat.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Time I got real.
text: He regards the others.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: Time we all did.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Get real? What's that mean?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: ... Means we're through with that
dialog: life.
text: Fait's eyes meet Tommy's. Beat. Tommy nods.
text: Fait looks to Daria for her answer.
speaker_heading: DARIA
dialog: I'm with you, T.
text: He looks to Miles.
speaker_heading: MILES
dialog: Whatever you say, man.
text: Fait looks back to Su. They hold the look.
speaker_heading: SU
dialog: ... Good luck.
speaker_heading: FAIT
dialog: ... Faith.
text: Another beat. Then they turn and start walking toward the
text: arriving cop cars. Daria and Miles follow. Archie and
text: Tommy lag behind. As they all walk away from us --
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: What, you're all gonna go straight,
dialog: just like that?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Maybe oughta try it yourself.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Me? Are you kidding? I've had
dialog: straight jobs. You ever had a
dialog: 99.
dialog: straight job?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I had plenty of straight jobs.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: Name one.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I sold Avon door-to-door.
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: ... You were an Avon lady?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I was an Avon man. You got a problem
dialog: with that?
speaker_heading: ARCHIE
dialog: No, it's just, well, uh...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Nah, I'm just fucking with you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But my momma did it, and don't you
dialog: dare start disrespecting my momma...
dialog: And so on... OFF which, we...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: THE END
