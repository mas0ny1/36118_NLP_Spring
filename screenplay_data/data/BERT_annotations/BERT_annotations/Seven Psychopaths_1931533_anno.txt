scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY CHURCH -- DAY
text: The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky.
text: The church bell rings, resonating.
text: Mass has let out. Small church, small congregation. The dirt
text: road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on
text: foot heading to outlying farms and homes. An old two-story
text: house sits across the road. Lone.

scene_heading: INT. OLD HOUSE -- DAY
text: Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than
text: bright. SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty
text: second-story room. He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn
text: wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls.
text: Somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled
text: away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath. He runs his finger
text: across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper.
text: He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly.
text: He pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a
text: roughly squared section with the rose at its center.
text: He studies it in his hand.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD HOUSE -- DAY
text: Birds sing. Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Is something wrong?
text: Somerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real
text: estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford
text: Thunderbird. He holds a check and a booklet of receipts.
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT)
dialog: Is something the matter?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: No... no. There's nothing wrong.
text: Somerset still seems distant.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (writes receipt)
dialog: Not that it's any of my business... but,
dialog: are you figuring on moving out here
dialog: eventually?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Soon.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I just never seen a man mortgaging an
text: empty house before.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Everything here still seems... seems so
dialog: strange to me. All this.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I don't know. I'd say this place is
dialog: about as normal as places get.

text: The man walks over to hand over a receipt. Somerset accepts the
text: receipt, folds it. Somerset smiles.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: That is exactly what I mean. Strange.
text: Somerset looks back at the house. The man does not understand.
scene_heading: INT. AMTRACK TRAIN -- DAY -- (CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS)
text: Somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out
text: the speeding train. He is near the back of the car, away from
dialog: the few other passengers.
text: Outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass. The entire panorama
text: is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun.
text: The light flickers across Somerset's placid face.
scene_heading: INT. AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY
text: The train is nearly full. Somerset has his suitcase on the
text: aisle seat beside him. He has a hardcover book unopened on his
text: lap. He still stares out the window, but his disposition has
text: soured. The train is passing an ugly, swampy field.
text: A car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken. A little
text: further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their
text: coats matted with blood.
text: Somerset turns his head to watch the dogs.
text: Away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight.
scene_heading: INT. AMTRACK TRAIN -- EARLY EVENING
text: Passing urban streets below. Slums. Smashed cars. People
text: stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps.
text: Somerset's suitcase is by the window. Somerset is now in the
text: aisle seat, reading his book.
scene_heading: INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT -- (END CREDITS)
text: Curtains closed. The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will
text: be everywhere in this story. A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS. Somerset's
text: life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a
text: closet and hundreds of books on shelves.
text: Somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed.
text: He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical
dialog: metronome.
text: He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and
dialog: http: //www.dailyscript.com/scripts/seven_early.htm| Page 3 of 138
text: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker 11/13/13 3:17 PM
text: forth. Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK.
text: Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady.
text: Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes. The metronome's
text: ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm. Somerset's
text: face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome.
text: His eyes close tighter.
text: Tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly. Somerset's
text: breathing deepens. The car ALARM seems QUIETER.
text: Tick, tick, tick. Somerset continues his concentration.
text: The METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND. Somerset's face relaxes
text: slightly as he begins to fall asleep. Tick, tick, tick...
scene_heading: EXT. CHINESE BODEGA/CITY STREETS -- NIGHT
text: DAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 400z bottle of beer. He is
text: a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always
text: smoldering. FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated
text: storefronts. He crosses the street under elevated subway
text: tracks. A train roars overhead.
text: Mills watches it as he walks on.
text: Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills,
text: throwing his shadow long down the deserted street.
scene_heading: EXT. URBAN STREET OF ROW HOMES -- NIGHT
text: This rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat
text: skyscraper. Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and
text: pieces of junk in the gutter.
text: Ahead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to
text: break into the trunk of a parked car.
text: Mills draws near. One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will
text: be a problem, continues prying. Mills stops, calm.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Is that your car, man?
speaker_heading: FIRST THUG
dialog: What the fuck do you care?
text: Mills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Does that car belong to you?
text: The thugs look at each other, gauging. They face Mills.
speaker_heading: FIRST THUG
dialog: http: //www.dailyscript.com/scripts/seven_early.htm| Page 4 of 138
text: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker 11/13/13 3:17 PM
dialog: Yeah, it's my car, alright? Fuck off.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: You're telling me that's your car?
text: The second thug starts the long way round the car.
speaker_heading: SECOND THUG
dialog: Well, for some strange reason, I don't
dialog: believe you.
text: Mills gives a â€œisn't that silly" laugh, shifts his gaze --
text: Sees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon.
speaker_heading: FIRST THUG
dialog: (steps forward)
dialog: You can fucking suck my...
text: Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle
text: against the first thug's head. The thug falls, swings blindly.
text: The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife.
text: Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the
text: second thug's face -- CRACK. Broken nose.
text: The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose
text: squirting blood.
text: Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard.
text: The first thug is screaming, trying to stand. Mills takes one
text: step, punts the first thug's head. The crowbar clatters away.
text: Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when
text: the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards.
text: Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold.
text: They both struggle spastically. The thug's winning.
text: Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one
text: knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car.
text: Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair
text: and holds the man's head against the car's side window. Mills
text: free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's
text: the charm as the window shatters. The thug goes out cold.
text: Mills backs off, still incensed. He rubs his throat, looking at
text: the two prone men. Slowly, he regains some composure.
text: He takes a keychain from his pocket. He unlocks the door of the
text: car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat. He walks to
text: collect the other thug off the street.

scene_heading: INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- MORNING
text: Somerset picks items off a moving box: keys, wallet, homicide
text: badge. Finally, he opens the hardcover book from the train.
text: From the pages, he takes the pale, wallpaper rose.
scene_heading: INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT -- DAY
text: A wall is stained by a starburst of blood. Somerset stands,
text: melancholy, looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a
text: sawed-off shotgun. The apartment is gloomy. DETECTIVE TAYLOR,
text: 52, looks through a notepad.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
text: Neighbors heard them screaming at each
dialog: other. It was nothing new or unusual.
text: But, then they heard the gun go off.
dialog: Boom, boom... both barrels.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Did his wife confess? Did she actually
dialog: speak the words?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: When the patrolman got here she was
text: trying to put his head back together.
text: She was crying too hard to say anything.
dialog: (shuts notebook)
dialog: Crime of passion.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Yes. Look at all the passion splattered
text: up on the wall here.
text: Taylor shifts his weight, impatient, annoyed.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: This is a done deal. All but the
dialog: paperwork.
text: Somerset looks at a coloring-book open on the coffee table.
text: There are crayons beside it. Somerset picks the book up.
text: He flips through: crudely colored pictures.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Did their son see it happen?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What kind of question is that? Huh?
dialog: (pointing)
text: He's dead. His wife killed him. There
dialog: it is. That's all. Anything else has
dialog: nothing to do with nothing.

text: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker 11/13/13 3:17 PM
text: Somerset replaces the book, digs up a cigarette from his pocket.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR (CONT)
dialog: You and your fucking questions,
dialog: Somerset. I'm glad I'm getting rid of
dialog: you today. You know that, you fuck?
text: David Mills enters, dressed in a suit. He looks a bit lost.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Uh... Lieutenant Somerset?
text: Somerset lights his cigarette, looks to Mills.
speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: I'm David Mills... your new partner.
scene_heading: EXT. TENEMENT/CITY STREET -- DAY
text: A body-bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement
text: doors. Somerset follows. Mills follows Somerset. They walk
text: towards the end of the filthy block.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: I'ma little thrown. I just finished
dialog: orientation at central, and they dumped
dialog: me off down here.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: I heard you brought in two small-timers
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Yeah. Two real idiots.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Since we are just starting out, I
dialog: thought we could go to a bar. Sit and
dialog: talk for awhile. That way we can...
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Excuse me, but I'd rather start sniffing
dialog: for a case, if it's all the same to you.
dialog: Seeing how we only have a week for this
dialog: whole transition thing.
dialog: (waits)
dialog: I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p.,
dialog: know what I mean?
text: Somerset walks, no reply. Mills searches to get a read on him.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: I meant to ask you something... when we
dialog: spoke on the phone. I can't help
dialog: wondering...

text: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker 11/13/13 3:17 PM
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: (wary)
dialog: I... I don't follow.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: All this effort you've gone through, to
dialog: be transferred from Philadelphia to
dialog: here. It's the first question that pops
dialog: into my head.
text: Mills formulates his response.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: I'm here for the same reasons as you, I
dialog: guess. Or... at least the same reasons
dialog: you used to have for being here...
dialog: (cutting)
dialog: ...before you decided to give up.
text: Somerset stops and faces Mills.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: You think you know me? You just met me
dialog: two minutes ago.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Maybe I don't understand the question.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: It's very simple. You've come from the
dialog: "City of Brotherly Love" to the "City of
dialog: Brotherly Hate," detective. I've never
dialog: seen it done that way.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: I don't know. Maybe I thought I could
dialog: do more good here than there.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You know, it'd be great by me if we
dialog: didn't start right out kicking each
dialog: other in the balls. But, you're calling
dialog: the shots, lieutenant, so however you
dialog: want it to go.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Let me tell you how I want this to go.
dialog: I want you to look, and I want you to
dialog: listen.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: I wasn't standing around Philly guarding
dialog: the fucking Liberty Bell.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: But, you've never worked homicide in

dialog: this city.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: I realize that.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Well, please do me the favor of
dialog: remembering it.
text: Mills just stares back at Somerset. Somerset walks. Mills
text: rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, "what'd I do to deserve
dialog: this?" He follows Somerset.
scene_heading: INSERT -- TITLE CARD
speaker_heading: MONDAY
scene_heading: INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING
text: Somerset lies asleep on the bed. It is still dark outside.
text: Relatively quiet. The PHONE beside the inactive metronome RINGS
text: HARSHLY. Somerset awakens suddenly, rankled.
scene_heading: INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING
text: It is barely becoming light outside. Mills can't sleep.
text: Alone in a double bed. He sits up, frustrated. Sits on the
text: edge of the bed and looks around. The room is a shambles,
text: filled with moving boxes.
text: The light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy
text: on one box. Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen
text: motion at the trophy's pinnacle.
text: Mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face.
text: The CLINKING of DISHES and SILVERWARE is HEARD from another
text: room. Mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled.
scene_heading: INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- EARLY MORNING
text: Across a living room full of boxes, TRACY MILLS, 30, a beautiful
text: woman, stands in her bathrobe. She's upset about something,
text: takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter.
text: She pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea
text: from a pot on the stove. Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans
text: back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door.
text: The tea is too hot to sip, and as Tracy is placing the mug on
text: the counter behind her the PHONE RINGS. Startled, she releases
text: the mug too close to the edge. It falls --
text: Crashes to the floor, shatters.

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING
text: A dark hall. Somerset and Mills stand with OFFICER DAVIS, 28, a
text: beefy, uniformed cop. Light from a camera's flash spills in
text: from the nearby kitchen. Davis hands Somerset two flashlights.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: At what time did you confirm the death?
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: Like I said, we didn't touch anything,
dialog: but we were on scene at like o-five-
text: hundred, so he's had his face in a plate
text: of spaghetti for about half an hour.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Wait, wait, wait. You didn't check him?
dialog: You didn't check vital signs?
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: Believe me, he's gone. Unless he's
text: breathing spaghetti sauce now.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: No. The point is, when you're first man
dialog: in, you check vital signs.
speaker_heading: DAVIS
text: This guy's sitting in a pile of his own
dialog: shit and piss. If he ain't dead he
dialog: would have stood up by now.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: (getting angry)
dialog: Listen, Godzilla...
text: Somerset steps in, heads Mills off.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Thank you, Officer Davis. We'll see you
dialog: again after we've had a look.
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Davis leaves, eyeing Mills. Mills watches him. Somerset hands
text: Mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: I wonder what exactly was the point of
dialog: the conversation you were about to get
dialog: into?
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: And, I wonder how many times Officer
text: Davis there has found a supposedly dead
dialog: http: //www.dailyscript.com/scripts/seven_early.htm| Page 10 of 138
text: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker 11/13/13 3:17 PM
dialog: man who didn't really die until Davis
text: was back in the patrol car calling the
text: morgue and eating a powdered donut.
text: Somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Drop it. We have more important
dialog: concerns just now, don't we?
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Fine... for now.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: The POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER packs up, hoists his camera and
text: equipment bag. Somerset and Mills enter. Mills puts on his own
text: pair of rubber gloves. The grubby kitchen is small; barely room
text: for four people to move around in. The photographer exits:
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Bon appetit.
text: The only light is a murky green illumination from the ceiling.
text: The light bathes an OBESE MAN who is slumped forward in a
text: kitchen chair, face-down-dead in a plate of spaghetti.
text: The sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with
text: soiled paper plates. The plates hold bits of half-eaten
text: sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk-food remnants.
text: Mills and Somerset turn on their flashlights. Mills points his
text: at the green bulb above. Aluminum foil has been wrapped around
text: the bulb to focus the light on the corpse.
text: Somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight. He goes to the
text: body and kneels beside it. There's a rope tied around the
text: man's wide gut. Mills comes to stand beside Somerset.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: I guess that makes it homicide.
text: Somerset crouches lower, uses a pen to lift one of the dead
text: man's pants cuffs. Rope is tied around the purplish ankle.
text: Mills examines the knots behind the chair's back. Shines his
text: flashlight on the man's belly.
speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
text: Still, he could have tied himself in.
dialog: To make it look like murder.
text: Somerset isn't listening, focused on the corpse. He studies the
text: man's head and neck without touching.
speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: http: //www.dailyscript.com/scripts/seven_early.htm| Page 11 of 138
dialog: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker
dialog: I don't see any blood or bruises yet.
dialog: No wounds. You see anything?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: Not yet.
text: Somerset stands, points his flashlight: the obese man's stiff
text: hands are clutching utensils. A knife in the left hand, a fork
text: sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging
text: skewered. Cockroaches swarm.
text: Mills turns to the sink and stove. Each burner of the stove has
text: a used pot or pan on it. There's food slopped everywhere.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: I saw a guy once... committed suicide,
dialog: but he wanted to make sure his family
dialog: could collect insurance money, right?
text: Somerset walks to the room's only window. The window has been
text: painted over with black paint. he touches the window with his
text: pinkie finger. The paint is still wet.
text: Mills goes to a trash can by the refrigerator. The trash can is
text: full to the brim with empty food containers.
speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: So, this guy took this big knife... and
text: he held it behind him, put the tip of it
text: in his back, and he ran backwards into
dialog: the wall. Cause, he thought it was
text: going to look like someone stabbed him
text: in the back.
text: Mills opens the refrigerator. It's nearly empty.
speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: Except, he poked a big fucking hole in
dialog: the dry wall when he did it.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: If you could... spare me the anecdotes
dialog: for now. Leave the refrigerator open
dialog: for the light.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oh, forgive me. I thought we had this
dialog: male-bonding thing going. My mistake.
text: Somerset looks at the floor, deep in thought. His flashlight
text: beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and bits of food
text: running from the stove to the table.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: What do you smell? Other than him, and

speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: (sniffs)
dialog: I don't know... there's something.
text: Somerset goes close to the table, then leans to peer under.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
text: A bucket.
text: Somerset points the flashlight and Mills crouches, pulls up the
text: tablecloth on his side of the table. Two large dead rats lay on
text: the floor beside a metal bucket.
text: Mills grimaces, slides under the table, careful to avoid the
text: rats. He looks in the bucket. He leans back, baffled.
speaker_heading: MILLS
text: It's vomit.
text: He looks at Somerset under the table.
speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
text: It's a bucket of vomit.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Is there any blood in it?
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Can't tell by looking.
text: Somerset stands, perplexed, stares at the dead man. There is a
text: knock at the door. The detectives look to DOCTOR THOMAS
text: O'NEILL, 52, the medical examiner. O'Neill is a frumpy man,
text: seems a bit gone, looking at the green bulb.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: Mood lighting. Very sixties.
text: He drops his bag on the floor, sorts through the contents.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: (to Somerset)
dialog: You think he was poisoned?
text: Mills goes to the trash can, pokes the garbage with a pencil.
speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: And, those rats there somehow ate the
dialog: poison off the floor?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Guessing this early is useless.

speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: There's room. Light's the problem.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Well, three is certainly a crowd in
dialog: here. And, with four, someone's bound
text: to be stepping on evidence.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Detective Mills, go help the officers
dialog: question the neighbors.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: (not pleased)
dialog: Thanks, but no thanks. I'll stay on
dialog: this.
text: Somerset watches O'Neill at the corpse. O'Neill points a thin
text: flashlight with his mouth, his hands free for the examination.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Send one forensic in on your way out.
text: Mills is pissed. He lifts his flashlight to shine it on the
text: side of Somerset's face.
text: A moment passes. Somerset looks at Mills, light shining
text: directly in Somerset's eyes. A longer moment. Mills switches
text: the light off. He leaves.
text: O'Neill unceremoniously places both hands on the dead man's
text: head, lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: He is dead.
scene_heading: INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, BASEMENT GYM -- DAY
text: THWACK, THWACK... THWACK. Mills punches the heavy bag with
text: hard, quick punches. Sweat drips off his face. He's in work-
text: out clothing, a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves.
text: The walls are covered in mirrors. Other cops watch Mills as
text: they pass, checking out the new kid. Mills keeps punching,
dialog: skillfully.
text: He stops when he sees Somerset reflected in one of the mirrors.
text: Somerset walks over, carrying a pizza box with paper piled on
text: top. He sits on a near bench, takes out a cigarette.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET

speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: We need to chat.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT GYM, BOXING RING -- DAY
text: Mills opens a door and enters with Somerset behind. They are
text: alone. Chairs face an old, limp-roped boxing ring. Practice
text: pads hang from pegs on a wall. Mills clasps a pair in his
text: gloves, offers them to Somerset.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: You just hold them up. I do all the
dialog: work.
text: Somerset takes the pads reluctantly, puts them on. He still has
text: the un-lit cigarette hanging from his mouth. Mills climbs into
text: the ring. He holds the ropes open for Somerset, waits.

dialog: Oops. My hand slipped.

scene_heading: INT. URBAN SCHOOL, OFFICE -- DAY
text: Tracy looks out a window from behind steel bars.
text: Below her, young children play in a playground. They're playing
text: hop-scotch, throwing balls, chasing each other. The swing sets
text: are broken. The handball wall is graffitied.

dialog: I'm sorry, Mrs. Mills. We don't have

text: Tracy looks back at the playground: on the other side of a
text: chain-link fence, a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the
text: ramp of a freezer truck. he carries a big, whole, slaughtered
text: pig on his shoulder.
text: The pig's head flops as the butcher walks. Some children stop
text: their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND SUBWAY TRAIN -- DAY
text: The train clatters through a tunnel, packed full, WHEELS
text: SCREECHING. The lights go on and off. Passengers read
text: tabloids, stare at their feet, study advertisements on the
text: walls; anything to avoid making eye-contact with others.
text: All races, creeds and colors; all ugly, forlorn human beings.
text: Tracy stands fatigued, holding a handrail.
text: A bag-lady, crusted with dirt, reeking, pushes her way through
text: the crowd. A man presses against Tracy in an attempt to let the
text: bag-lady pass. Tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways
text: to make room. She looks down.
text: On one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno
text: magazine, THREE-WAY FUCK, in one hand. His other hand is in his
text: pocket. He's obviously masturbating himself in his pants. No
text: one else notices or seems to care.
text: Tracy looks away, disgusted. She closes her eyes. The train's
text: wheels SCREECH LOUDER as the train takes a curve.
scene_heading: INT. INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT
text: The front and one side of the shop are entirely open to the busy
text: sidewalk and street. A transparent plastic canopy frames the
text: entrance. A STRANGE MAN, 20, stands at the edge of the canopy.
text: He wears a stained sweatsuit outfit and hums a song, oblivious.
text: Tracy and Mills look together over the piles of fruits and

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: He sounds interesting.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: He is that, if nothing else.
text: Mills throws some oranges in the basket hanging from Tracy's

text: Mills notices Tracy's interest. He keeps comparing carrots.

speaker_heading: TRACY (CONT)

speaker_heading: MILLS

dialog: I know. I know...

dialog: I'm not going to close my eyes and block

scene_heading: TRACY'S P.O.V. -- THE STREET

scene_heading: INT. INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT
text: Tracy's anger fades. She shakes her head, touched, amazed by

scene_heading: TRACY'S P.O.V. -- THE STREET
text: Mills deposits the old woman on the other side. She thanks him,

text: A small transistor RADIO PLAYS on the bedside table.
text: Mills and Tracy are in bed, making love under the sheets. They
text: move rhythmically, kissing, sweating hard.
text: Mills holds Tracy's hair in his hands, pulls her head back as
text: she gasps and he thrusts his entire body against hers.
text: Mills' hair is soaked. He is anything but mellow as a lover,
text: quickening while Tracy twists underneath him. Tracy holds tight
text: to the back of his neck with one hand.
text: Finally, Mills pushes himself up on his arms, holding his head
text: down against Tracy's chest. Holds for a long moment, till he is

dialog: Goodnight.

dialog: Goodnight.

dialog: If you can see...
dialog: I have emptied all of everything out of
dialog: the stomach. But, look at it, now that
dialog: I took away the liver.
text: Santiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse. Mills

dialog: don't see in.
speaker_heading: SANTIAGO (CONT)
dialog: I move the lungs over. First, see how
dialog: big this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is.
dialog: Now... here is the strange thing, on the
text: stomach. Stretches.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: And, here is it distended. Look at the
dialog: size of that, because of the foods.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: I can see what you're pointing at...
speaker_heading: SANTIAGO
text: On the stomach. The lines of
dialog: distention.
text: Somerset's looking in, not believing what he sees.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Doctor, are you saying this man... ate
dialog: till he burst?
speaker_heading: SANTIAGO
dialog: Yes, well, he didn't actually burst. He
text: was bleeding, inside of himself.
dialog: And, there's a hemotoma on the
text: outside... on the belly.
text: Somerset walks around the slab, looking the body over.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: He died by eating?
speaker_heading: SANTIAGO
text: Someone punched him, or kicked him.
text: Somerset notices something on the partially shaved head.
text: He leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back
text: of the dead man's head; circular bruises, some darker than
text: others, all about the same diameter as a dime.

dialog: Oh, and there is this here... something

text: Most of his stomach contents are in the
dialog: lab now... but, this. I found these in

text: Santiago looks amongst tools, buckets and jars of liquid. He
text: picks up a glass jar and shows it to Mills. In the jar: many
text: little bits of blue plastic. Like scrapings.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Plastic?
text: Mills gets Somerset's attention, hands him the jar. Somerset

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING
text: Outside the door to the murder scene, Mills and Somerset cut
text: through the RESTRICTED AREA/CRIME SCENE seal.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Those bruises on the back of the
dialog: victim's head were caused by the muzzle
text: of a gun.
speaker_heading: MILLS
text: So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and
dialog: gave him a choice: eat, or get your head
text: blown off.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- MORNING
text: Somerset and Mills enter. Somerset takes out the jar of plastic
text: scrapings, turns on the now normal light. They begin to search.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
text: He was force-fed... till his body
text: started rejecting the food. He
dialog: literally couldn't eat another bite.
speaker_heading: MILLS
text: So, the killer held a bucket under him.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
text: His throat was swollen from the effort.
text: He was bleeding internally.
dialog: He must have blacked out... and, if
dialog: you're the killer, you're not going to

text: Somerset gets down, holds the jar against the linoleum.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Same color and texture.
text: They both crawl on hands and knees, study every inch of floor.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: If this is what that is... it doesn't

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Always look for one thing to focus on.
dialog: There's always one singular thing, and

dialog: but find it and focus... till it's an
dialog: exhausted possibility.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: How are pieces of the floor going to get
dialog: in the guy's stomach?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Exactly. Why would so many pieces be
dialog: inside his stomach unless they were
dialog: placed there intentionally?
text: Somerset notices deep scratches in the linoleum, fingers the
text: grooves. He takes a piece of plastic from the jar, holds it to
text: the scratches, fiddles with it, fits it in. He looks up to see,
text: these scratches are in front of the refrigerator. It looks like
text: they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away
text: from the wall and pushed back at some time.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- LATER MORNING
text: We are BEHIND THE REFRIGERATOR as it is rocked back and forth.
text: It's pulled away from the wall. Somerset and Mills strain, pull
text: a few more feet, then release. They lean to look --
text: The refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust
text: has been cleared. In that space: a circle, smeared in grease,
text: and a note taped in the center of the circle.

dialog: It's still pretty fresh meat. I called

dialog: When I got to it, I knew. As soon as I
dialog: laid eyes on it, I knew...
text: The detective opens the door. FOLLOW Somerset and Mills --
scene_heading: INT. LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING
text: Gross, deep yellow light comes through the only window with its
text: blinds up. The light anoints a NUDE MAN displayed, dead.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE (0.S.)
dialog: ...this is your guy who did this.
text: The nude dead man's legs are folded under him as if he were
text: kneeling, and he's bent forward, chin on the floor. His eyes
text: are open, his arms outstretched before him. Mills and Somerset
text: walk to either side of the man.
text: The detective closes the door, bites his thumbnail. The
text: apartment is on a high floor, so it's quiet.
text: Somerset sees the window has been covered with a sheet of yellow
text: gel, stapled in place to produce the colored light.
text: Mills examines the corpse. There's a chair one foot behind the
text: nude man. It's an elegant leather chair, drenched in blood.
text: There's a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge

text: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker 11/13/13 3:17 PM
text: stain of blood under the chair. Mills looks at pieces of cut
text: rope on the floor behind the chair. The rope is knotted.
text: Somerset crouches beside the body. There's a big piece of flesh
text: missing from the man's left side, as if the love-handle had been
text: lopped off. Hundreds of pennies lie scattered under and around
text: the man. The man's hands are palms up, fingers wrapped around
dialog: more pennies.
text: Mills walks over to examine a scale on the floor between the
text: corpse and the doorway. It's an old-fashioned counter-balance
text: scale with two suspended dishes on a see-saw arm. In the high
text: dish: the hunk of flesh missing from the man's side. In the low
text: dish: a one pound counterweight.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: (to Somerset)
text: A pound of flesh.
text: Somerset stands and walks backwards to view the entire scene
text: from near the door.
text: He looks worried, vaguely frightened. He turns his head, looks
text: to a far wall. Beside a big, abstract, constructivist painting,
text: there's a note pinned up inside a triangular smear of blood.
scene_heading: INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING
text: An office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is

dialog: This victim, Mr. Gold, was tied down

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Look at both killings together. This

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: An artist?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
text: He uses colors and symbols. He

scene_heading: INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- MORNING
text: Old office. Moving boxes on the floor. The single window faces
text: a billboard. Somerset works on a manual typewriter. He types
text: hunt-and-peck, slowly. His paperwork is on the desk in two
text: sloppy piles. A jarring SOUND is HEARD OFFSCREEN, like fingers
text: on a blackboard. Somerset looks up, irritated.
text: A WORKMAN is working at the open door, holding the source of the
text: sound, a razor blade he's using to scrape the words DETECTIVE
text: SOMERSET off the door's window.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: Sorry.
text: Somerset turns back to typing. The captain steps in, looks at
text: the workman, then drops more papers on Somerset's desk.
text: As always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw. He
text: looks around. Two of boxes on the floor have DETECTIVE MILLS
text: written across them. The captain picks one up, puts it on top
text: of the other. He sits, watching Somerset, starts straightening
text: the forms on the desk.

text: Somerset reclines, looks at the captain.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Did you read in the paper today, about
dialog: the man who took his dog for a walk?
dialog: And how he was mugged? And, his wallet
text: was taken, and his watch. Then, while
text: he was still lying unconscious, his

dialog: both eyes. It happened last night. Not
dialog: far from here.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: I heard.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: I have no understanding of this place.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: It's always been like this.
text: Somerset saddles up to the typewriter. Hunt-and-peck.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Yes. You're absolutely right.
text: The captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: You were made for this work, Somerset.
dialog: I can't believe you're going to trade it
dialog: all in for a tool belt and a fishing
dialog: rod. But, I guess I'm wrong.
text: The captain leaves. Somerset looks up now that the captain's
text: gone. He grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their
text: disheveled state. He looks at the workman.
text: The workman is looking at Somerset, has a rag in his hand to

text: The grandly furnished apartment where the second murder took
text: place has been dusted for prints and searched.
text: Two female forensics are at work.
scene_heading: INT. LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY
text: Mills is seated in front of a long writing desk with many
text: drawers. All the drawers are open. Mills looks through letters
text: and stationary. Nothing of use. He tosses the pile back.
text: He sits back, frustrated, yanks off one rubber glove, looks
text: around the room. Books have been taken off their shelves, the
text: bed has been stripped. The room has been given the once over.
text: The victim's family photographs hang in expensive frames on one
text: wall. There are at least thirty photos of various sizes:
dialog: ancestors, sons and daughters, grandchildren and friends. An
text: over-weight forensic, CHRIS, 35, leans in through the doorway.
text: Mills looks up and Chris shakes his head glumly.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: He must have left us another puzzle to
dialog: solve... somewhere.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We'll keep looking, but we're running
dialog: out of possibilities.
text: Chris leaves and Mills stands to stretch. Something catches
text: Mills' eye. He walks over to the door, curious. At the base of
text: the open door, there's a ball of paper wedged under to act as a
text: doorjamb. Mills puts his glove back on, pulls the ball out.
text: He uncrumples the paper as the door slowly swings shut. The
text: page has a drawing on it, of the sun with waves of heat at its
text: edges. There is a single eye in the center of the sun.
text: An arrow is drawn in dried blood on the back of the closing
text: door. Mills notices this and pushes the door closed.
text: The blood arrow points to the side and up, seems to be pointing
text: to the photo gallery wall. Mills goes to examine the photos.
text: His eyes search each photo... one by one... till he sees it:

text: circles have been drawn in blood around the woman's eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS, DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT
text: An assault on the senses. Crowded streets and sidewalks. On
text: every corner, in every doorway, on every stairwell -- freaks,
text: junkies, punks, leather boys and motorcycle girls. A few
text: tourists wander in the mix, heedful of the dangers around them.
text: Buildings border narrowly.
text: Somerset walks against the stream. He carries a file.
text: CAR HORNS HOWL. MUSIC BLASTS from the entrances of clubs.
text: REGGAE from one club is soon OVERTAKEN by RAP from a second
text: story window. TECHNO-POP blasts from the tattoo parlor.
text: Somerset does not like this place, views it with disdain. He
text: walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground. The men are
text: pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically.
text: Somerset takes a cigarette from a full pack, lights it as he
text: crosses through the traffic jam in the street. A VAGRANT steps
text: up with his hand out.
speaker_heading: VAGRANT
dialog: Spare me a cigarette, money-grip? Spare
dialog: me a cigarette?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Sorry. Last one.
text: He walks on. We BEGIN to HEAR JAZZ MUSIC.
scene_heading: INT. JAZZ CLUB -- NIGHT
text: A club at capacity. The JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES like a slow, cool
text: breeze from a JAZZ TRIO on a platform.
text: The air is thick with smoke. Yuppies sit elbow to elbow with
dialog: the last members of the beat generation. Everyone's drinking
text: beer, smoking pot.
text: Somerset crosses the club, looking for someone. He takes a
text: tissue from his pocket, rips pieces off and jams the pieces in
text: his ears. At the back of the club, a major-league bouncer
text: stands in front of a closed door. Somerset shows his badge and
text: the bouncer steps aside with reservation.
scene_heading: INT. NARROW STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
text: The walls are black. Somerset opens the door, enters, walks
text: down the long flight of stairs. As Somerset descends, the JAZZ

text: At the bottom, Somerset opens another door. He enters --
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND ART GALLERY -- NIGHT
text: A narrow room. SPEED METAL is even LOUDER. This is a private
text: art party. The people are lizard-like, pale. Men and women
text: priding themselves on their gauntness.
text: Somerset passes canvases on the walls. Pointlessly abstract
text: paintings. Splatters, smears and blobs of color.
text: Party-people stand in front of these "works," engrossed.
text: Somerset slides past, not interested in the art, jamming the
text: tissue further in his ears. He spots his objective.
text: WILLIAM McCRACKEN, 42, stands inside a circle of admirers. He is
text: dressed like a pauper, his baggy clothing stained with many
text: colors of paint. He wears dark sunglasses, bored by the
text: bleached-blonde girl whispering in his ear.
text: Somerset worms his way to stand in front of William. The party-
text: goers turn their attention to this intrusion.
text: William looks up, pushes the girl away. He takes off his
text: sunglasses. His eyes are badly bloodshot and listless.
text: He looks Somerset over... and then grins, glad to see him.
scene_heading: INT. MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Mills stands brooding over a photocopy of the picture of the
text: woman with her eyes circled in blood. He looks overworked,
text: drinks coffee. His desk is swamped with files.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: I have voiced the same concerns to our
dialog: law enforcement officials, and they
dialog: assure me he is of the highest caliber.
text: Mills looks to a t.v. on a table, picks up a remote, increases
text: the volume. On the screen, MARTIN TALBOT, 47, source of the
text: voice, stands before reporters. He's a powerful presence, with
text: a gold tooth in the front of his mouth.

dialog: Mills is a wonderful human being...
speaker_heading: TALBOT (V.O.)
dialog: However... however... let me say this...
text: Mills looks back at the television.
speaker_heading: TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)
dialog: If Detective Mills, at any point in this
dialog: investigation... if he is not pulling
dialog: his weight, I will be the first in line
text: to pull his plug.
text: Mills points the remote, turns the t.v. off as reporters crowd
text: Talbot. Mills stares at the blank screen, dispirited.
text: Across the room, Tracy stands in the doorway. Mills does not
text: see her. He looks at the photocopy and sits at his desk.
text: Tracy watches him, great concern in her sad eyes.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: Somerset walks through this vast artist's studio, a converted
text: warehouse space filled with canvases. It's clear the works at
text: the underground art gallery were William's. William climbs a
text: ladder to a loft storage space. He moves cautiously, like he's
text: not quite up to the task.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I always figured that's the only reason
dialog: you and I used to be friends. Because I
dialog: was a friend of hers.
text: William yanks a painting wrapped in dusty paper, climbs down.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT)
dialog: Speaking of which...
text: William hands the painting to Somerset, walks to a director's
text: chair facing a paint-splashed canvas on an easel. He is a used-
text: up man, bound in an apathy-induced haze. He sits, picks up a
text: squeeze bottle of orange paint from a table of supplies.

text: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker 11/13/13 3:17 PM
dialog: I painted that about five years ago. I
dialog: always told myself I'd give it to you
dialog: next time I saw you.
text: Somerset starts unwrapping the painting.
text: William "paints," using the squeeze bottles and by flicking
text: saturated brushes so that the paint flies against the canvas.
text: Most times, he's not even looking at the canvas or colors he's
text: using. He looks over his shoulder at Somerset.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT)
dialog: Things are different these days, pal.
dialog: You wouldn't believe it...
text: Somerset looks at the unwrapped painting and is hit by a swell
text: of memories. Horribly sad memories. It's a portrait in oils of
text: a pretty, red-headed woman.
text: William shoots red paint with one hand, concentrates on
text: lighting a filterless cigarette with the other.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT)
dialog: People buy my paintings now... they
text: drive down in their BMWs and Rolls
dialog: Royces. It's the new money generation.
dialog: I guess they think they're touching the
dialog: avant-garde...
text: William looks at his creation, then calmly kicks the easel over.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT)
dialog: There's another thousand dollar William
text: McCracken expression of anarchy.
text: William gets up, walks across the wet canvas, leaving
text: footprints. He looks down at what he's done.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT)
dialog: Make that two thousand.
text: He laughs. Somerset holds up the delicately rendered portrait.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: How is she? Have you seen her recently?
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Huh... oh. No. She moved out of the
dialog: city. Last winter. She married some
dialog: businessman, or something like that.
text: Somerset fights the anguish this causes, puts the painting down.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Good for her.

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Yeah? What happened to the idealistic
dialog: super-cop I used to know?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: He became a realist.
text: William grunts, flicks his cigarette away, takes out a bag of
text: pills. He palms a few, notices the judgment in Somerset's eyes.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Oh... sorry.
text: William turns his back to Somerset, pops the pills. Out of
text: sight, out of mind. Somerset is disappointed, disgusted.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Not that I don't appreciate your recent
dialog: artistic endeavors... but, what happened
dialog: to the painter I used to know?
text: William smiles like a dolt, laughs a little.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I can't remember.
scene_heading: INT. WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT
text: Color photos of the first and second murder sit on a drawing

text: William examines with Somerset looking over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Man... can I buy these from you?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: They're not for sale.
text: Somerset lays out photos of the notes, triangle and circle:
speaker_heading: SOMERSET (CONT)
dialog: What is it? What's the murderer trying
dialog: to say?
text: William narrows his eyes. Does not know.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET (CONT)

dialog: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker
text: William has an idea. He ambles over to a row of cabinets where
text: oversized art books are stacked. He hunts through a pile,
text: shoves some books aside.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT)
dialog: I... I've seen things like that...
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Where?
text: William keeps digging, finds one book, finds another. He opens
text: one as he walks back to the drawing table.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: It's church stuff. Christianity.
text: William lays a book down, finds a page. He opens it to
text: Somerset. There is a circle to the side of the text. It says
text: GLUTTONY under the circle.
text: Somerset creases his brow, turns the page. William opens
dialog: another book.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (CONT)
dialog: When it first started... Christian
dialog: artwork was all from Bible stories. It
dialog: was like... nobody had any imagination.
dialog: It was all... standardized.
text: William pages through and we catch glimpses of the bizarre,
text: worlds of Hieronymus Bosch. Horrifying religious visions.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM (0.S.,CONT)
dialog: But, later, everyone started painting to
dialog: tell their own stories... to teach
dialog: lessons. Guys like Bosch, Bregel the
dialog: elder... Van Eycks.
text: William shoves the open book to Somerset. Somerset looks:
text: Seven paintings in a circular pattern showing characters giving

text: Somerset turns the book to examine each painting right side up.

dialog: And, it's two down... five to go.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT
text: A bright, tawdry intersection. Neon swirls and circuit-bulbs on
text: porno theatres provide the flash. Cars, taxies, and barkers
text: urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise.
text: The streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans, mostly
text: men, looking around, sizing up promises made on porno placards:
text: FUN WITH NUDES, BIG BOOBS, NAKED DESIRE, etc. The usual

text: MOVE through the crowds. Meet JOHN, a balding, middle-aged man,
text: wearing thick glasses. There is not a single thing strange or

text: nervous, looking at the porno palaces.
text: His sweaty hand clutches a Bible tight against his chest. He

scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT
text: People pass on the sidewalk. John is amongst them, but he

dialog: Interesting isn't it, friend? You like

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You know, Somerset, David is very...

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: He's a good cop. He just...

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Well... this will only take a minute.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Take your time.
text: Somerset writes. Tracy looks over the stack of books:

text: black and white copies of pages from art books.
text: He stares, thinking. He stands, takes a photocopy off the wall.

scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL LIBRARY -- AFTERNOON
text: Big brass lamps hang from the high ceiling. Mahogany chairs and
text: tables run down the center floor which is bordered by three
text: levels of balconies. People wander like ants in an ant farm.
text: Mills walks, taking it all in. He goes to the circulation desk.
text: Impatient patrons wait in a long line. He watches the bored
text: HEAD LIBRARIAN, female, 64, help an old man at the desk.
text: She opens the old man's books, runs a laser pen over a bar code
text: sticker, pushes a few buttons on a computer.
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL LIBRARY, TOP BALCONY -- LATER AFTERNOON
text: Near the balcony railing, overlooking the main floor, Mills sits
text: before a computer card catalog. He reads the computer screen,
text: unsure. He sets down his pad and pencil, cracks his knuckles,
text: begins typing on the keyboard. The computer gives off a quiet
text: BEEP. Pleased, Mills reads the screen. Types.
text: On the screen: TITLE / PARADISE LOST_
text: He hits return. Reads the screen as information on the book
text: appears. He copies it on his pad, puts the pencil in his mouth.
text: He types. On the screen: SUBJECT / JACK THE RIPPER_
text: Hits return. Again, he copies info from the screen.
scene_heading: INT. INNER CITY CLOISTER -- AFTERNOON
text: A monk opens a formidable gateway door, letting Father Bleeker
text: and Somerset into a garden courtyard. Bleeker now wears his
text: priestly garb and collar. The monastery's main building looms
text: at the end of a pathway. The building is stately, ivy-covered.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Father Stone had a church and
dialog: congregation of his own. But, he...
dialog: there were some problems. The church is

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Problems?

speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: There was a small orphanage attached to
text: the church, overseen by Father Stone.
dialog: This was almost thirty years ago.
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: He was an excellent priest, devoted in
dialog: every way. Many in his parish demanded
dialog: his return.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Tell me what happened.
text: Bleeker sees a NUN down the hall, coming towards them.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Allegations were made... Stone was
dialog: accused of abusing the children in his
dialog: care. But, those charges were never
dialog: substantiated.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: What abuse?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: It was claimed... that the children were
text: beaten. And, punished severely.
text: The nun is too close for Bleeker to speak freely.
scene_heading: INT. INNER CITY CLOISTER, STONE'S ROOM -- AFTERNOON
text: The door is unlocked and opened by the nun. Somerset enters and
text: Bleeker waits outside as the nun closes the door. It's dark.
text: FATHER STONE, 73, is in a wheelchair. Feeble and frail, eyes
text: sunken in their sockets. He looks up at Somerset.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Father Stone. I'ma policeman. I'd
dialog: like to ask you a few questions, if it's
dialog: alright?
text: The whites of Stone's eyes have yellowed. He seems to nod.
text: Somerset sits on a stool, close.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET (CONT)
dialog: I want to ask you about the seven deadly

dialog: you understand what I'm saying?
text: Stone takes his hand away, seems to be getting angry.
speaker_heading: STONE
dialog: Are you a sinner?
text: Stone's weak arms wheel him away, towards a corner.
speaker_heading: STONE (CONT)
dialog: There are sinners here. Even here.
dialog: And, pain waits for them. Hell is
dialog: hungry for them.
text: Stone bites his lip, moaning, disoriented.
speaker_heading: STONE (CONT)
dialog: They don't realize... they don't know.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Fuck them all!
text: Somerset is shocked by the strength and volume of Stone's jagged
text: voice. The nun goes to place a comforting hand on Stone's
text: shoulder. Stone is beginning to cry.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: (to Somerset)
dialog: They shouldn't have let you disturb him.

scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL LIBRARY, OUTSIDE LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON
text: From a mahogany hallway lined with book-carts, we look THROUGH a

text: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker 11/13/13 3:17 PM
text: We cannot hear them, but it's clear Mills is excited as he walks
text: back and forth, hovering over the librarian, looking at her
text: computer screen, making suggestions, then walking to monitor a
text: dot-matrix printer which spews a waterfall of computer paper
text: onto the floor. Back and forth goes Mills, carrying the phone.
text: He closes the pad, puts it in his pocket.
text: The librarian finishes typing, sits back, done. Mills hangs up
text: the phone, goes to put it on the librarian's desk, but the cord
text: drags, knocks a pile of books off a table.
text: The librarian is irritated, goes to pick up the books. Mills is
text: apologizing. He goes to watch the printer. He tears the last
text: sheet's perforated edge, gathers the huge pile of printed paper
text: off the floor.
text: Prize in hand, Mills is so grateful he bends to give the old
text: woman a kiss on the cheek, but she pushes him away, now even
text: more annoyed. Mills goes to leave, knocks over another pile of
text: books. Before he can assist, the angry librarian points to the
text: door. Mills obeys like a scolded child, exits.
text: The librarian shakes her head in disgust.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- AFTERNOON
text: A once exemplary church, now boarded up, neglected. Gothic in
text: style, it stands with deserted brownstones and empty lots of
text: rubble as neighbors. Smokestacks spew smoke distantly. Cars
text: and trucks drive by on a nearby elevated highway, but down here
text: on the street it's a ghost town.
text: There's a building attached to the rear of the church.
text: Somerset's car is parked beside it.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED ORPHANAGE, CLASSROOM -- AFTERNOON
text: The windows are covered over. Somerset and Father Bleeker move
text: through. Somerset has a flashlight with a wide beam. The room
text: is empty except for broken, cob-web covered school desks and a
text: few file cabinets. There are cracked blackboards on the walls.
text: Rats skitter away from the light.
text: Somerset opens a file cabinet drawer. It's empty. He walks to
text: a door, starts pulling at the rotting boards which seal it shut.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: I'm just looking.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED CHURCH -- AFTERNOON

text: Shafts of colored light needle through the holes in the pieces
text: of wood and cloth that cover the broken stained glass windows.
text: Somerset walks down the center aisle between deteriorated pews.
text: rats run. Pigeons flap about, dirt drifting off their wings.
text: Somerset shines his flashlight forward to the rather barren
text: altar. To the right, at the top of the altar stairs, there is a
text: stone statue of a saint with his arms outstretched, welcoming.
text: The life-size saint is covered in spider-webs. Tiny spiders
text: crawl across his eyes, which look down on Somerset.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Saint Jerome Emiliani. The patron saint
dialog: of orphans.
text: Somerset shines the flashlight against the back altar wall,
text: revealing a wooden carving of Christ crucified.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Is this still the Lord's house?
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: Of course it is.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: And, even if Father Stone was guilty of
dialog: everything... if he was hurting children
dialog: here? It's still the Lord's house?
text: Father Bleeker finds this talk insulting and offensive.
speaker_heading: BLEEKER
dialog: You have no faith, Somerset? Have you
dialog: given up on the church entirely?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: No.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That's not what I've given up on.
text: Somerset notices two ends of a thick rope suspended from the
text: ceiling above the center of the altar. He looks up, following
text: the rope with the flashlight, when he notices something else.
text: His mouth drops. Bleeker looks, and is equally horrified.
text: Above them, in the beam of light: seven large paintings on
text: panels tilted forward at the curve of the ceiling above the
text: altar. Seven ancient paintings; seven deadly sins.
text: The beam of light moves to the panel to the immediate right: a
text: painting of a man kneeling, grasping at gold coins all around
text: him. The man is naked, as was the victim of the greed murder.
text: The chief color in this panel is a vulgar yellow.
text: The third in the series is sloth. The painting, in indigo,

text: are rolled up in their sockets. He is covered in slimy worms.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: The streets are full of patrol cars. Cops and forensics enter
text: and exit the church from various doorways. Saw-horses are
text: loaded off a flat-bed truck as a police barricade is erected.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: Much activity, as forensics with flashlights go about their
text: business, checking every nook and cranny of the church, looking
dialog: for any sign that someone's been here recently. Small temporary
text: floodlights are hoisted on tripods.
text: Two photographers stand at the tops of tall ladders. Flash-
text: photo after flash-photo is taken of the seven paneled tableau.
text: Near the open church doors, Mills speaks with great animation,
text: holding his ream of computer paper. Somerset looks at the altar
text: and the tableau, preoccupied.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Our guy's a bookworm, right? And, I
dialog: know it's a long shot, but you have to
dialog: give a picture id and current phone bill
dialog: to get a library card. Hey...
text: Mills snaps his fingers in Somerset's face, gets his attention.
speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: I made two separate lists of books. One
dialog: relating to the sins... Dante's
dialog: Purgatory, Canterbury Tales... The
dialog: Dictionary of Catholicism... all the
dialog: religious stuff. The second list was
dialog: books about torture methods, mass
dialog: murderers... sadomasochism. Whatever
dialog: our killer might study to do the things

dialog: are.
text: Somerset takes the computer list.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: So, what is this?
speaker_heading: MILLS

speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: (psyched up)
dialog: If somebody's out there reading Paradise

text: Somerset looks up from the list, warming to it. He starts
text: looking around, searching for someone.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: Somerset and Mills exit down the stairs. Somerset's still
text: searching, holding the list. He spies a uniformed cop, DARIO.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Dario! Come here.
text: Dario runs up. Somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes
text: him walk with him. Mills continues on to his car.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET (CONT)
dialog: According to the Father, this orphanage
dialog: wasn't around for more than five or six
dialog: years in the late fifties. So, I want
dialog: someone to go to the Department of Child

dialog: records on this place. Understand?
speaker_heading: DARIO
dialog: I got it.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Get a list of every child who attended
dialog: this orphanage before it shut down. Get
dialog: it on my desk within the hour.
text: Somerset releases Dario, who runs to obey. Somerset goes to his

scene_heading: INT. SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING
text: Seven large photos hang with the other materials on the wall:
text: The seven tableau paintings. Gluttony, greed and sloth,
text: followed by vanity. Vanity shows a woman standing in front of a
text: mirror, staring at her image. The floor around her is scattered

dialog: Ramirez. Manuel Ramirez.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET (0.S.)
dialog: No... I don't see any Ramirez.
text: The lust painting is next. It shows a man standing over a

dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I'll do the talking, right? Let me

text: Mills smiles at his own wit. A STAIR is HEARD CREAKING

speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: It's him! Jesus Christ, we can get this

text: backwards as bullets begin raining up from below, accompanied by
text: the SOUND of an UZI SUB-MACHINE GUN FIRING.
text: Somerset lays flat as he and Mills crawl away from the railing,

dialog: of Theology, Handbook of Firearms, A History of the World, Summa
dialog: Theologica, U.S. Criminal Law Review, etc.
text: Mills looks at the desktop. The surface is marked by dried oil
text: colors. There are tubes of paint laying out, boxes of water
text: colors and pastels. Mills looks at one corner of the desk. An
text: orange candle has been allowed to burn down. The wax trail goes
text: all the way down the edge of the desk to a puddle on the floor.
text: Somerset walks, studying one wall of pin-ups. There are
dialog: articles about the seven deadly sins, pages from art books,
text: pencil drawings of Satan and Christ, and drawings of the seven
text: paneled tableau paintings which inspired the murders. Somerset
text: lifts several sheets to note the paper scraps are spaced so
text: tightly and completely that they cover the window.
text: At the desk, Mills opens the top middle drawer. It's empty
text: except for The Holy Bible. he opens another drawer, which is
text: filled with at least forty empty aspirin bottles.
text: Somerset looks at a door which is papered over by all the

text: darkroom, lit by red bulbs, with strips of film hanging from the
text: ceiling. WATER is HEARD DRIPPING.
text: Mills opens the shower curtain. Prints hang drying, clipped to
text: wires over the tub.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, THE PAINTROOM -- NIGHT
text: Somerset enters from the room of notebooks. This is John Doe's
text: art studio. Windowless, with several easels holding paintings
text: in various states of completion. The walls are covered with
text: photos and finished canvases, except for one wall which is blank
text: white. Somerset turns the lights off.
text: There is a 16mm film projector on a table, facing the blank
text: wall. Somerset turns the projector on. It clatters to life,
text: running a piece of film.
text: The film is spliced into a non-stop loop. Somerset watches the
text: wall, light strobing across him.
text: The projector shows an image of clouds drifting, with strange,
text: superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily. It's
text: like an old, Hollywood version of heaven.
text: The image switches abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring
text: around a pit of molten goo. Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece
dialog: of film from Hollywood's early days.
text: Somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel. The

text: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker 11/13/13 3:17 PM
text: painting has been skillfully rendered, in small, controlled
text: brush strokes. It shows a modern city street, stylized, dark.
text: The city is peopled by mutated humans and freakish beasts.
text: Sinners in the streets, killing, raping, pillaging. Buildings
text: are burning, blood is being spilled. It's dense with detail.
text: Somerset walks to another painting which is covered by a drop
text: cloth. He removes the cloth, uncovers a huge canvas. We do not
text: see the painting, but when Somerset does his features turn grim.
speaker_heading: MILLS (0.S.)
dialog: Somerset!
text: Mills enters, tormented, weary. He stands in the projector's
text: bright beam, holds an 8" by 10" print.
speaker_heading: MILLS (0.S.)
dialog: Somerset, we had him. Goddamn it.
text: He hands a press pass and the photo to Somerset.
speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: The pass is a fake... we had him.
text: Somerset looks at the photo, a picture of Mills and Somerset on
text: the stairwell of the slum apartment building; the picture John
dialog: took when he posed as a reporter.
speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: We were that close to him.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: I know.
text: Somerset motions to the huge canvas. Mills looks:
text: The painting is frightening collage, thick with paint. The
text: photo of Mills and Somerset has been incorporated in bits and
text: pieces. Duplicate images: enlarged eyes, hands, faces. The
text: faces have been ripped, scratched, mutilated. Grainy eyes with
text: holes jabbed in them are mounted in paint beside chopped broken
text: arms. Mills' head is on Somerset's body, and vice versa. It's
text: like a sick, fragmented vision of a slaughter house floor.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS -- NIGHT
text: A block of burnt-out row homes and warehouses. Stray, wild dogs
text: roam in a pack. A car turns down this street. It's John Doe's
text: car, moving fast. Its headlights go out and it cruises,
text: avoiding garbage cans in the street.
text: FOLLOW the dark car. Ahead, a few blocks away, we can see the
text: only lights in this neighborhood, the flashing reds, whites and
dialog: blues of police activity.

text: John Doe brings the car to a stop. He watches the police at
text: work around the abandoned church. He gives no discernable
text: reaction, puts the car in reverse. He looks behind as he drives
dialog: back the way he came.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: The refrigerator door is open. A male forensic uses tongs to

scene_heading: INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM ONE -- NIGHT
text: The forensic walks through with the hand in a clear plastic bag,
text: past a FEMALE SKETCH ARTIST who puts the finishing touches on a
text: fairly accurate drawing of the balding John Doe.
speaker_heading: SKETCH ARTIST
dialog: This is the guy?
text: Mills stands over the artist. Sarah, Billy and two deputy

dialog: You got it. Tomorrow morning, this

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to Mills)
dialog: We can't find anything to hang onto. No

speaker_heading: MILLS

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It's just... we haven't found any

text: Somerset bristles slightly at Mills' abrupt demeanor.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: We've got about five thousand notebooks
dialog: in this room. And, as near as I can

speaker_heading: MILLS
text: Then, he must write about the murders.
text: Somerset looks at the notebook, reads.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: "What sick, silly puppets we are, and

dialog: "On the subway today, a man came up to

dialog: No dates indicated. They're placed on

dialog: You were right. He is preaching.
text: The PHONE RINGS in the other room.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT

dialog: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker
text: recorder is rigged to the receiver. Mills and Somerset enter.

speaker_heading: JOHN DOE (V.O.)

text: John Doe hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT 604, BATHROOM -- NIGHT
text: Somerset looks around this femininely decorated bathroom.
text: In the sink, objects covered in blood: a pair of scissors, a
text: hypodermic needle, first-aid tape and gauze bandages, a bottle
text: of anesthetic for use with the needle, a straight razor.
text: Somerset moves from the sink, looks in the bathtub. The tub and
text: shower walls are splattered with blood. The tub has a few
text: inches of water in it. The water is cloudy red and bits of
text: gauze float in it. Somerset jiggles the drain's knob.
text: Some bubbles pop up from the clogged drain.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT 604 -- NIGHT
text: Mills is in a dark mood. He and Dr. O'Neill stand by a WOMAN
text: who hangs by a noose from the ceiling. The woman's head has
text: been bandaged sloppily with white gauze and tape. Her eyes have

text: The woman hangs low, so her feet are inches from the floor where
text: piles of dried flowers and a cordless telephone lay. There's a
text: chair knocked over behind her.
text: O'Neill's going through his black bag. A violet, velvet curtain
text: has been draped on the wall in the corner, behind a full length
text: mirror. The mirror reflects the corpse. A seven-pointed star
text: is smeared in lipstick on the mirror's surface, with the words I
text: DID NOT KILL HER, SHE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE below.
text: Somerset enters from the bathroom, looks at the murder display.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Pride. Just like in the painting.
text: Somerset nods. He walks to a dresser. The woman's purse sits
text: open and Somerset extracts her driver's license. He looks at
text: the photo. The woman in the picture is beautiful.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: You can see what he did.
text: O'Neill steps up to the woman. He brandishes dull scissors.
text: The captain enters with two uniform cops. He looks around,
text: grim, clenching his jaw.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Cut her up... dressed the wounds. He
text: put the noose around her neck and stood

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: She had the telephone.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Call for help, and you'll live. But,

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Or, kick out the chair, and spare

text: O'Neill's cutting the bandages on the woman's face. He pulls
text: them away in front. Mills looks, disgusted by the sight.
text: Somerset sits in a chair, runs his fingers through his hair.
speaker_heading: O'NEILL
text: He cut off her nose to spite her face.

text: The bookstore is a labyrinth. Tables and shelves, mountains and

dialog: search for titles.
text: Somerset walks, downcast, winds out of one aisle into another.
text: he has his jacket over his shoulder, runs his fingers along the
text: books as he goes. He pulls one book, The Merchant of Venice,
text: looks at it, replaces it. He looks down the aisle and is

text: Tracy stands solemn, scanning book spines. Somerset approaches.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Tracy?
text: Tracy brightens a bit upon recognizing him.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Somerset. How are you?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: I'm alright. I'm glad to see you found

dialog: Sounds like a father who wanted his son

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: One birthday, he gave me a hardcover
dialog: book called The Century of the
dialog: Detective, by Jurgen Thorwald. It
dialog: traced the history of detection as a

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Goodnight.
text: Somerset reaches to touch Tracy's face. They kiss. They kiss a

text: Somerset runs his fingers through Tracy's hair. They share

speaker_heading: SOMERSET (CONT)
dialog: I'm sorry, Tracy. I'm sorry.
text: Tracy's face is flushed. She is confused.
speaker_heading: TRACY

scene_heading: INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- LATER NIGHT
text: Mills and Tracy are asleep in their bed. Mills' eyes shift

scene_heading: INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT
text: Mills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly, gun held up.

text: Mills walks between moving boxes, attempting to remain silent.
text: He aims the gun from point to point as he advances.
text: He gets to a closet. Staying on one side, he opens the door and

scene_heading: INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Mills returns to the bedroom, still holding his gun up. He

speaker_heading: MILLS

speaker_heading: MILLS

speaker_heading: SOMERSET

dialog: He wouldn't just stop.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Well... what the fuck, man?
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: John Doe's only two murders away from

speaker_heading: MILLS

speaker_heading: SOMERSET

speaker_heading: SWARR

speaker_heading: SWARR

text: He turns and runs to a sleek helicopter on the roof's heli-pad,

speaker_heading: CALIFORNIA
dialog: Is this wind going to hurt us?
text: The pilot cranks the helicopter's whining engine and the blades

scene_heading: INT. MILLS' CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: What's your story, Johnny? Who are you,
dialog: really?
text: Doe pushes his glasses back up the bridge of his nose, looks at

speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: It doesn't matter who I am. Who I am
dialog: means absolutely nothing.
scene_heading: INT. SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: FROM HIGH ABOVE, we see traffic on the highway at the polluted

scene_heading: INT. SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: Traffic is bumper to bumper. Somerset moves his headset

speaker_heading: MILLS (V.O.)

dialog: And yet, no pillar of salt.

dialog: Lost on you, isn't it? You've never

speaker_heading: MILLS (CONT)
dialog: I'm not going to let you win this!
text: John Doe steps out of the waterfall, putting on his glasses.
text: He seems calm, unloads his gun into Mills' back... BLAM, BLAM...
text: Mills twists, blown forward by the bullets slamming into his
text: bullet-proof vest. BLAM, BLAM, BLAM... he stumbles, trying to
text: turn and fire back, but bullets strike him down and he falls to
text: the floor of the catwalk, gun falling from his hand.
text: CLICK. Doe's gun is empty. The gunshots echo. Mills lays
text: there on his stomach, pounded, blacking out, the hot bullets in
text: his vest smoking and sizzling from the water splashing them.
text: Doe moves quickly, starts searching Mills' pockets.

dialog: Mills! Pull out!
text: His voice reverberates, barely heard against the roaring water.
text: he swims to the edge, climbs out. He walks, looking...
speaker_heading: SOMERSET (CONT)
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: Pull out now!
text: Somerset looks up, and freezes up on seeing --
text: -- Doe's handcuffs hang, swinging, on the rail of the catwalk
text: above, with Mills' radio transmitter and wire tied to them.
scene_heading: EXT. INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT
text: Somerset runs to his car, driven, gasping for breath, still
text: soaking wet. He stops for one second, looks.
text: Not too far away, the police helicopter flies low to the ground,
text: turning in wide circles.
text: Somerset climbs into the car, starts it up. He drives away,
text: leaving his lights off. The engine protests loudly, forced to
text: its limit. The car disappears in darkness.
text: The police helicopter circles, useless.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT
text: The church stands elegant at night, when its decayed state is
text: partially hidden. Small shafts of light escape from holes in
text: the facade and just into the blackness.
text: Somerset is out of his car. He strides towards the church,
text: checks his gun as he goes. FOLLOW with him, getting closer to
text: the church. He climbs the stairs.
text: Somerset steps up and kicks the church doors open, met by a
text: tremendous blast of light --
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED CHURCH -- NIGHT
text: Flickering orange light from hundreds of once tall orange
text: candles, now burnt low. They greet Somerset, in the church's
text: old candle racks, on the floor, on the altar and all through out
dialog: the pews.
text: Somerset's eyes try to adjust to the light. He holds his gun
text: ready, walks down the long center aisle.

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Where's David?
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE (0.S.)
dialog: He's here. With me.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Tell me what you want.
text: Somerset can see through the heat warp. Doe stands facing him
text: from the altar.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: What do I want? The same you... I want
dialog: an ending. Stay where you are. Put
dialog: your gun on the floor and slide it all
dialog: the way down here.
text: Somerset obeys, bends, slides the gun down the aisle till it
text: hits the bottom altar stair. He keeps walking, slowly.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: I want to see him. Show me Mills.
text: On the altar, Doe is sweating hard, standing over Mills. Mills
text: is slumped forward on the floor, unconscious. His bullet-proof
text: vest has been removed.
text: Mills' hands are tied tight together in front of him, tied to
text: one end of the thick rope suspended from the ceiling. Doe holds
text: the other end of the rope, has his gun tucked under his belt.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: You're an intelligent man, Somerset.
dialog: You understand what you're a part of,
dialog: don't you? When this is finished, it
dialog: will seem surreal, but it will be a
dialog: whole, crystalline reality. And, no one
dialog: will be able to deny it, no matter how
dialog: hard they try.
text: Doe's voice is thick with passion. Somerset is about halfway
text: down the aisle, still moving.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: You're a murderer. That's all. The
dialog: only way you've distinguished yourself
dialog: is by your particular brutality.
text: Doe walks across the altar.

speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: Stay where you are!
text: Somerset stops.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE (CONT)
dialog: I won't deny my personal desires. I
dialog: won't.
text: Doe begins dousing Mills with gasoline, covering Mills' body and
text: clothing. Mills stirs, coming to. He coughs, choking on the
text: gas and fumes.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE (CONT)
dialog: But, I don't mourn the victims in this
dialog: any more than I mourn the thousands who
dialog: died in Sodom and Gomorrah.
text: Somerset looks fearful. He starts approaching again.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: All you've done is cause more misery and
dialog: pain! You've given people all the more
dialog: reason to believe there is no God!
text: Somerset eyes his gun at the bottom of the stairs.
text: Doe sees Somerset moving, throws the gas can away, takes out his
text: gun. Doe walks to the edge of the altar, all the time holding
text: his end of the rope.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: Stop!
text: Somerset is twitching with anger, looking at the gun about
text: fifteen feet in front of him.
text: Mills manages to look up, weak, his eyes barely able to open
dialog: because of the stinging gasoline.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Somerset?
text: Doe takes one step down off the altar. Somerset is still edging
text: forward, hands out away from his body.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Do you really think I'm just going to

speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: Yes.
text: Doe fires his gun and the bullet slams into the front of
text: Somerset's bullet-proof vest. Somerset flies back, knocking
text: over a rack of candles on his way to the floor.
text: Doe walks quickly back onto the altar.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: Motherfucker!
text: Mills tries to grab at Doe as he passes, but Doe turns and kicks
text: Mills in the ribs. Mills cringes in pain.
text: Somerset lays in the aisle, on his stomach, gasping. He can't
text: catch his breath, his twisted face pressed against the floor.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: How can you speak of God, Somerset?
dialog: When was the last time you spoke His
dialog: name?
text: Mills tries to rub the gas out of his eyes with his bound hands.
text: His mind works feverishly. He looks around to see where he is,
text: then he searches the floor. We can see, inside his open shirt,
text: the bleeding, upside-down cross Doe has cut into his chest.
text: Doe walks back to shout angrily down at Somerset.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE (CONT)
dialog: When did you last speak His name? Was
dialog: it in prayer? Or, did you say the
dialog: Lord's name after you stubbed your big
dialog: toe? Or, did you use His name to curse
dialog: another man?
text: Somerset holds his chest, blinking, trying not to black out.
text: Mills finds a piece of broken stained glass on the floor. He
text: picks it up, palms it, still choking on gasoline.
text: Doe walks over to the statue of Saint Jerome Emiliani, pulling
text: the rope from above so it goes taut and Mills' arms raise above
text: his head. Doe wraps the rope around Emiliani's arm.
speaker_heading: MILLS
dialog: I'm going to kill you, Johnny. I'm
dialog: going to see you dead.
text: Doe begins twisting the loose end of the rope around the statue.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: The irony, David, is that you policemen
dialog: and I want the same things. But, you
dialog: http: //www.dailyscript.com/scripts/seven_early.htm| Page 130 of 138
dialog: "Seven", unproduced draft, by Andrew Kevin Walker
dialog: are so short sighted. In this city,
dialog: where you can see a deadly sin on every
dialog: street corner... and in every home, we
dialog: want repentance.
text: Mills clutches the glass piece and starts cutting the rope just
text: above his hands.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE (CONT)
dialog: We want good over evil. We want values
dialog: instilled in the children. We want a
dialog: world where a man or woman can lead a
dialog: decent life.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Wisdom, understanding, counsel,
dialog: fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of
dialog: the Lord. Such simple concepts. Why
dialog: are they non-existent?
text: Somerset manages to life his head, struggles to his knees.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Let him go, God damn you.
text: Doe checks to make sure the rope around Saint Emiliani is secure,
text: tightening the knots.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: There were two men once, who had
text: wonderful gardens. Two gardens of
dialog: flowers that went on as far as the eye
dialog: could see. Beautiful gardens... the
dialog: fragrance was inspiration in itself.
text: Doe stands behind Emiliani, heaves against the statue.
text: Mills watches, gritting his teeth, rubbing the glass against the
text: rope, fingers bleeding.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE (CONT)
dialog: But, both gardens were beset by
dialog: problems. Weeds started to take root,
dialog: and there were infestations of insects
dialog: and diseases. The gardens started to
dialog: turn putrid. And, one man fought to
dialog: save his garden, because he could never
dialog: forget how it once was. Everyday he cut
dialog: the weeds, and killed the insects.
dialog: Fought the diseases.
text: Doe finally topples the statue, down the altar stairs, and the
text: other end of the rope pulls Mills upwards, screaming in pain.
text: Mills is held, about eight feet in the air, legs dangling.

text: Somerset gets to his feet,
dialog: He started
text: steadying himself on a pew.
text: Doe walks across the altar, picks up a long metal pole with a
text: thick wick and candle snuffer on the end.
text: He lights the wick
text: from a near candle. The flame burns long and thin. He looks
text: down at Somerset, takes out his gun.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE (CONT)
dialog: Stay there, Somerset. Or, I'll kill him
dialog: right now.
text: Doe holds the flaming pole up, near Mills.
text: Somerset stops. He looks up at Mills.
text: Mills is straining. He nods to Somerset,
text: Mills cutting at the rope.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: and Somerset sees
dialog: Alright... you don't have to do this,
dialog: John. You've already made

dialog: existence has been?
dialog: your point.
dialog: Can you even

speaker_heading: JOHN DOE (CONT)
dialog: So that the

dialog: the marrow.
dialog: So,
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: You're insane. That's why.
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: (seething)
dialog: No! You're wrong!

speaker_heading: JOHN DOE (CONT)
dialog: I was chosen. And I've wished a
dialog: thousand times I could have been a
dialog: normal man. Like David Mills, a common
dialog: man... with a common life. But, wishing
dialog: that is my sin. I can't have it and I
dialog: shouldn't.
text: Doe steps towards Mills.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: Don't do this!
speaker_heading: JOHN DOE
dialog: I meant what I said. I admire David
dialog: Mills. I envy David Mills.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Envy is my sin.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: No!
text: Just as Doe is to put the flame to Mills, the rope is finally
text: cut through. Mills drops, swinging his legs forward, smashing
text: Doe in the face, knocking Doe's glasses off.
text: Mills hits the floor with a thud.
text: Somerset runs forward.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET (CONT)
dialog: David, get out!
text: Doe has fallen back, dropping the metal pole. Mills scrambles
text: to his feet and charges at Doe, shouting.
text: Doe squints, screaming, raises his gun. Fires twice!
text: The bullets catch Mills in mid-run, and carry him off his feet,
dialog: backwards.
text: Somerset grips his own gun, just as Mills' body falls, tumbles
text: off the altar area and down the stairs in front of him.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET (CONT)
dialog: No!
text: Somerset lets out a scream of pain and rage that chokes in his
text: throat. He falls to his knees and halts Mills' body.
text: Somerset's shaking, unable to breathe, turning Mills over and
text: cradling his head in his arms. Tears come to his eyes.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET (CONT)
dialog: David... David? Please...

text: On the altar, Doe throws his gun away. he starts feeling around
text: him, unsteady, looking for his glasses.
text: Mills' eyes are closed. He is still, bloody. He swallows.
text: With one gasp, without a word, he is dead.
text: Somerset looks up at Doe, vision blurred by rage and tears.
text: Doe stands, putting on his glasses, faces Somerset.
text: Somerset lays Mills' body down. Stands, walks up towards the
text: altar, raises his gun.
speaker_heading: SOMERSET (CONT)
dialog: You.
text: Doe stands, quaking, teeth clenched, fists balled up. He waits
text: for the bullets, falls to his knees.
text: The gun trembles in Somerset's hand as Somerset brings the
text: barrel to Doe's face. A millisecond's pause. Somerset changes
text: the angle of fire. BLAM, he blows John Doe's arm to pieces ina
text: splattering explosion.
text: Doe screams, falling back, on the altar floor.
text: VIEWED FROM FAR BACK IN THE CHURCH
text: The entire church with its candles frames the torture:
text: Somerset walks to where Doe flops horribly, bleeding. Somerset
text: aims, shoots Doe in the leg. Doe screams, rolling, trying to
text: crawl away, knocking over candle racks. Somerset follows. He
text: shoots Doe's other leg. He shoots Doe in the other arm. Flames
text: begin to rise and spread quickly amongst the pews. Doe
text: continues to spasm, wrenching, hand slapping the bloody floor.
text: BLAM, BLAM, BLAM. Somerset steps back from Doe, overturns a
text: rack of candles on top of him. He steps away. Watching.
text: Flames begin rising on Doe's clothing.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON JOHN DOE'S FACE
text: Doe's face, covered in blood, twisted in agony, helpless, flames

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY
text: A field of blue. Cops in orderly rows. The funeral of David
text: Mills. Many police officials and politicians stand in tribute.
text: Somerset is here, in his dress blue uniform. He stares forward,
text: still numb, beaten. Rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen.
text: Blanks explode from the barrels. They reload in unison.
text: Somerset looks towards the grace where Mills' casket lies under
text: an American flag. Tracy is there.
text: Tracy stands surrounded by strangers at the grave-site. Her
text: head is lowered. She cries. Each blast of the rifle salute
text: causes her to react with a start.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY -- LATER DAY
text: The funeral is over. Somerset stands at the edge of the

dialog: That's all, Mrs. Mills. We got

speaker_heading: SOMERSET
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh... man...
text: He opens it. He takes out a small note, handwritten. It reads:
text: PLOW THEM UNDER.
text: Somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of
text: his emotions. He looks around:
text: At the miserable people, walking past him.
text: At a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting ina
text: cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside.
text: A father passes by, holding his young son's hand. Somerset
text: turns to watch them as they pass. The gather reaches to pick
text: the boy up and carry him. The boy holds tight.
text: For some reason, this makes Somerset ache with sorrow.
text: The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek. The

scene_heading: INT. MOVING TRUCK -- DAY

text: She's looking at the keys when she notices something about the
