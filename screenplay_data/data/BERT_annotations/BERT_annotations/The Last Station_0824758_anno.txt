dialog: All happy families are the same. Each unhappy family is

dialog: Leo Tolstoy- Anna Karenina
scene_heading: 1 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY. 1
text: High angle of the steam train travelling through a wide
text: river valley. The stack belching smoke against the Russian
dialog: sky.
scene_heading: 2 INT. SECOND CLASS CARRIAGE. COUNTRY SIDE. DAY. 2
text: Leo Tolstoy (80), sits writing on his lapboard. He is quite
dialog: simply the greatest living writer in the world. His
dialog: devotion to pacifism, his rejection of the trappings of
dialog: Orthodoxy in favor of a simple Christian lifestyle convince
dialog: many to regard him as a living saint. With him are his much
text: younger wife, the COUNTESS SOFYA, favorite daughter SASHA,
text: and his personal physician DUSHAN MAKOVITSKY. Sasha and
text: Dushan write in their diaries. Sofya looks from one to the
text: next a little impatient. The train begins to slow.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Why are we slowing down?
text: No one responds. Slower. Slower.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: We're stopping. Why are we
dialog: stopping?
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: I don't know, mother. No idea.
text: Tolstoy look up from his work, asks a passing conductor.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Excuse me, why has the train
dialog: stopped?
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: It's the crowd, ma'm, the people.
dialog: They're blocking the track.
dialog: In the distance we can here voices.
speaker_heading: VOICES (O.S.)
dialog: Long live Tolstoy! Long live the
dialog: old warrior!
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: But if they block the track, the
dialog: train can't go...YOU HAVE TO MAKE
scene_heading: THEM MOVE.
dialog: 2.
text: The conductor shrugs, walks away. She goes to the window to
text: investigate. A crowd of a hundred peasants, students
text: surround the engine, block the track. They carry a huge
text: cloth banner honoring Tolstoy. We can hear voices chanting
dialog: "Tolstoy. Tolstoy. Tolstoy", voices crying "You are the
dialog: truth." "You are the hope of the Russian people."
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Oh, they won't move. We are
dialog: gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and
dialog: say something to them. It's the
dialog: only way we are gonna get out of
dialog: here.
text: The chanting grows in intensity. Tolstoy gets to his feet,
text: walks to the window, shows himself to the crowd. A great
text: shout goes up. Tolstoy lifts his hand for silence.
text: Gradually, it comes.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I have seen your banner. And I´ve
dialog: heard what you say. You think I´m
dialog: the hope of Russia, do you? Well,
dialog: that´s not true. You are the hope
dialog: of Russia. The hope of all the
dialog: world. You say, you want a new
dialog: way to live? Well, you are not
text: gonna find it making a fuss over
dialog: me. So, I suggest that you get on
dialog: with your work and let a poor old
dialog: men get on with his.
text: The cries begin. "Clear the tracks. Let them pass. Let them
text: go." Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the
text: train pulls away.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY. 3
text: On the chanting crowd now as the train pulls away. We
text: focus on a handsome young man, a little stiff maybe, a
dialog: little intellectual. This is VALENTIN FEDOROVITCH
text: BULGAKOV. He can't contain his enthusiasm. Over the noise
dialog: of the train.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Do you know who that is? That is
dialog: the greatest man in the world.
text: The train pulls away into the distance.
scene_heading: TITLE OVER BLACK: SPRING 1910
scene_heading: 4 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DAWN. 4
dialog: The ancestral home of the Tolstoy family in the first
text: budding of spring.
dialog: 3.
text: Muzhiks (peasants) gather wood, carry water to the house. A
text: cart arrives loaded down with mail bags.
scene_heading: 5 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM. DAY. 5
text: A handsome room, walls covered with generations of family
text: photographs. Religious icons are given pride of place, a
text: testament, not to piety, but to an ingrained social
dialog: conservatism, a certain position in the world.
text: Countess Sofya mumbles her morning prayers before a make
text: shift altar. Wiping away tears, she leaves the room.
scene_heading: 5A INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ENTRY/STAIR. DAY. 5A
text: Sofya walks down the stairs and through the entry passed an
text: old servant asleep in a chair. She continues to the
dialog: basement.
scene_heading: 6 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY'S BEDROOM/STUDY. DAY. 6
text: Tolstoy has moved himself out of the refined upper floors
text: into a simple vaulted room he uses as both bedroom and
text: study. The walls are bare except for a portrait of his
text: daughter. The furniture is simple, some of it hand made: a
text: small bed against the wall, a little writing desk in one
text: corner stacked with books, littered with papers, more mail,
text: opened and unopened. Pairs of rude homemade shoes line a
dialog: work bench.
text: Tolstoy sleeps in his bed. Though it's late March and
text: still cold, the window is open. Sofya closes it. She
text: stands very still, watching Tolstoy sleep. Sitting on the
text: bed, she gently touches his hand, whispers.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Darling.
text: She lies next to him, something girlish, hopeful in her
text: face, as if waiting for him to wake up and adore her, but
text: he sleeps on. She carefully takes his arm, positions it
text: under her neck, and rolling toward him, wraps it around
text: her. The image of love's intimacy, of wedded bliss.
text: His hand slips off her shoulder, once, twice. She moves
text: awkwardly to replace it. He moves a little toward her. She
text: kisses his neck, his cheek. We don't know if he's awake,
text: but even this shadow of intimacy penetrates her soul.

scene_heading: 8 INT. MOSCOW. STUDY. DAY. 8
text: A handsome study in the Moscow townhouse of VLADIMIR
text: GRIGOREVICH CHERTKOV, Tolstoy's most articulate and
text: dedicated disciple. He's interviewing Tolstoy's newly
dialog: appointed secretary, VALENTIN BULGAKOV, the young man we
text: met near the train, who, at the mention of sex, blushes a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: But sex... You are twenty three.
dialog: Not an easy age for abstinence,
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Tolstoy does not approve of
dialog: sexual relations. I know this.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: He despises them, in fact...
text: Chertkov reaches for a small tin of moustache wax.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I don't want to belabor the
dialog: point, but I arranged for a
dialog: manservant last year who
dialog: proceeded to ruin two housemaids
dialog: just like that. He was very
dialog: upset.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: This would not be a problem. I'm
dialog: celibate. I'm also a strict
dialog: vegetarian.
text: Chertkov nods his approval, begins to worry his moustache.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Yes, I've heard many good things
dialog: about you. I've even read what
dialog: you`ve written. So has he.
text: Valentin's face flushes with pride. Chertkov steals a
text: glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase. One side of
text: his moustache droops a little. He tugs awkwardly at it.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: My dear boy, if you were to
dialog: become Tolstoy's private
dialog: secretary, you would be given a
dialog: great gift. You'll be with him
dialog: every day, eat together, walk in
text: the forest by his side.
dialog: It's difficult to contain himself.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Believe me, since becoming a
dialog: Tolstoyan, I have become so eager
dialog: to learn, so comitted to
dialog: discussing ideas, improving my
dialog: very soul.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Well, we have a lot to do if we
dialog: are to get his work to the
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: We?
text: They both laugh.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Yes, we. If we can encourage the
dialog: spread of passive
dialog: resistance...just think of it
dialog: Valentin thousands of ordinary
dialog: Russians casting off centuries of
dialog: spiritual and political
dialog: oppression-
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: In the name of truth and freedom.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Truth and freedom, yes but still,
dialog: my boy, there are so many enemies-
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Enemies?
text: Chertkov walks to the window, signals Valentin to follow
text: him. He points to
text: TWO MEN IN PLAINCLOTHES standing in the street below.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: The Czar's police...You'll be
dialog: followed when you leave
dialog: here...and the church will stop
dialog: at nothing to bring him back into
dialog: the fold. His children can't be
dialog: trusted... only Sasha... and then
dialog: of course there is the
dialog: Countess...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well, one doesn't like to come
dialog: between married people whatever
dialog: the circumstances, but her dogged
dialog: attachment to private property,
dialog: her public criticism of our
dialog: movement...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV (cont'd)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The point is, he needs a man of
dialog: your intellectual gifts around
dialog: him. Someone who can help him
dialog: with the new work. Someone who
dialog: understands his goals.
text: Chertkov returns to the desk.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: And although they've allowed me
dialog: to return to Russia, I can't see
dialog: him. They keep me under house
dialog: arrest... They might as well keep
dialog: me in a cage.
text: Clearly upset, Chertkov pauses to get control of himself.
text: He picks up a package, hands it to Valentin.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: So, I need you to put these
text: letters directly into his hands.
dialog: One can't be sure what gets
dialog: through to him.
text: Valentin looks at him, quizzical.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Sofya Andreyevna does not respect
dialog: his privacy.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: She wouldn't open his private
dialog: correspondence...
text: Chertkov raises an eyebrow. An ominous silence.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I have another task for you, my
dialog: dear.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: You'll keep a diary for me.
text: He hands Valentin a notebook.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I need to know everything that
dialog: goes on at Yasnaya Polyana. Let
dialog: me know who visits the house, any
dialog: talk of the copyright to his
dialog: work, any contact with the
dialog: church, what letters come and go.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Anything Sofya Andreyevna says.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: She's very, very dangerous.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. MOSCOW. DOORWAY/STREET. EVENING. 9
text: Chertkov kisses Valentin delicately on both cheeks and
text: ushers him into the dying light.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Godspeed, my boy.
text: Valentin makes his way to the droshky that awaits him.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: And remember what I said.
text: He turns back to the dark figure in the doorway.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Write everything down! Go!
scene_heading: 10 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. MORNING. 10
text: SOFYA. Black and white film of her being handed the

text: irritated by its presence.
text: CUTTING OUT TO COLOR we see a cinematographer on the lawn
text: cranking away at his camera. She goes into the house.
scene_heading: 11 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY'S BEDROOM/STUDY. MORNING. 11
text: Where Tolstoy, awake and dressed, sits on his bed, pen in
text: hand, writing in his diary. Dushan sits next to him, taking
dialog: his pulse.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Nothing's working... Hand me my
dialog: other boot, my friend, will you?
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Let me finish.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: It doesn't matter. If my heart
dialog: had stopped beating, I'd still go
dialog: riding today.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Your pulse is my
dialog: responsibility...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN (cont'd)
dialog: and if you must ride, I insist
dialog: you wear a coat. Even the sun is
dialog: cold today.
text: He puts Tolstoy's arm down and hands him his riding boot.
text: Sofya comes ranting into the room carrying several Russian
dialog: and international dailies.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: This is impossible! It really is!
dialog: These people are parasites!
dialog: Look...
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Countess Tolstoy has become
text: estranged from her husband. They
dialog: barely speak."
text: She throws the paper on the floor.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You know who spreads all this
dialog: rubbish....
text: She opens another paper, a French daily.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: C'est la meme en France. They
dialog: gossip about us in Paris... "They
dialog: do not share a similar view of
dialog: either religion or politics."
dialog: Incroyable!
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Peut-etre. You think that's
dialog: inaccurate?
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: I think it's none of the world's
dialog: business.
text: She looks at Dushan who is transcribing every word into his
text: diary. He does it with all the master's conversations.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: What are you doing? Don't do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Dushan Petrovich, you're
dialog: scribbling again?
text: Tolstoy moves with energy and purpose toward the door.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Darling, where are you going?
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Riding with Sasha. Don't expect
dialog: us for lunch.
text: Something strikes him. He walks to his desk, picks up his
text: pen and quickly writes a sentence on a scrap of paper.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Leovochka, why do you insist on
dialog: dressing like that.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Like the man who looks after the
dialog: sheep.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: It's not meant to offend you.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: But it does offend me, because it
dialog: offends reason. You're a Count,
dialog: for God's sake.
text: He puts his pen down, goes to her, kisses her gently on the
text: forehead and leaves the room.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Oh darling, I have something else
dialog: to say.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY (O.S.)
dialog: I doubt it not, my dear.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
text: He's forgotten his coat.
text: He runs after him, tripping over the long fur garment.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN (O.S.)
dialog: Count Tolstoy, you've forgotten
dialog: your coat.
text: Meanwhile Sofya notices a photographic portrait of Chertkov
text: on the wall. She takes it down and tosses it in the
dialog: corner.
scene_heading: 12 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY. 12
text: As Tolstoy appears on the porch, we hear the WHIR of
text: cameras. A crowd of photographers, film cameramen,
text: journalists, and disciples try to catch a glimpse of the
text: master. Dushan steps in front of him.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Let him walk. Let him walk.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Count Tolstoy, you're no doubt
dialog: distressed by the Czar's
dialog: treatment of your secretary
dialog: Nikolai Gusev ?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: These people are bandits.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: I said, let him walk.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: They come into my house and
dialog: arrest a man whose only crime is
dialog: to express a view of life saner
dialog: than that which prevails.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: So Gusev is innocent?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Of course, I'm the guilty one. I
dialog: reject the Orthodox church. I
dialog: condemn the established order and
dialog: I make no secret of it.
text: A young peasant shouts from the crowd.
speaker_heading: PEASANT
dialog: God bless you, Tolstoy. Thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Let him walk. Let him walk.
dialog: (to Tolstoy)
dialog: But you don't banish these people
dialog: very much to your credit...I wish
dialog: I had your largeness of spirit.
text: A photographer's flash goes off. An old Muzhik touches
text: Tolstoy's sleeve, as if expecting a miracle.
text: Sasha, her father's soulmate, leads two horses toward them,
text: her mount and her father's black gelding, Delire.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Papa.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Sasha!

speaker_heading: SASHA

scene_heading: 14 EXT. RIVER VALLEY. DAY 14
text: A steam train snakes through a broad valley.
scene_heading: 15 INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE. DAY. 15
text: Valentin in his buttoned up suit looks a little out of
text: place in the overcrowded third class carriage. He writes in
text: the diary given him by Chertkov. He glances up to see, on
text: the bench across, a young mother taking out her breast to
text: nurse her baby. He blushes, doesn't know where to look. An
text: old peasant catches his eye, winks at him, laughs.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. TELYATINKI. DUSK. 16
text: Seven miles from Tolstoy's estate, this is Telyatinki, a
dialog: communal center created by Chertkov dedicated to the study
dialog: and practice of Tolstoyism.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: Telyatinki was created by
dialog: Vladimir Grigorevich as a center
dialog: for the movement. Just last week
dialog: we had a visitor from India. We
dialog: talked to the group about the
dialog: healing properties of cobra
dialog: venum.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Oh, goodness..It's a beautiful
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: Yes, but we will pay for it.
text: Sergeyenko, Chertkov's joyless secretary, and Valentin
text: stand on a second storey porch looking out across the
text: central lawn where a number of young Tolstoyans tend the
text: garden, work to put up a chicken coop.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
text: The meeting room is behind us.
dialog: This is the tool shed. The
text: dormitory ahead.
text: He points out a larger building across the way.
scene_heading: 17 INT. TELYATINKI. SLEEPING AREA. NIGHT. 17
text: They enter the building.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: Telyatinki is a place of freedom.
dialog: Nothing is forbidden here.
dialog: Except everything.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
text: Each man is alone with his
dialog: conscience and his God.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The kitchen is below. You'll be
dialog: expected to assist with meals at
dialog: least twice a week ...and to give
dialog: a hand in the garden. We're all
dialog: equals here, you know...as
dialog: Tolstoy teaches us.
text: They start up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. SLEEPING PORCH. TELYATINKI. DAY
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: You are expected at Yasnaya

speaker_heading: VALENTIN

speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: Yes... you're lucky....We're all

dialog: 13.
scene_heading: 18 INT. TELYATINKI. VALENTIN'S ROOM: NIGHT 18
text: Small, sparse, perfect for the novice ascetic. Valentin
text: nods his approval.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: Vladimir Grigorevich is anxious
dialog: that you begin your reports as
dialog: soon as possible. You have the
dialog: notebook he gave you?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: You understand we must keep the
dialog: existence of the diary a secret.
text: Valentin smiles.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Just that...secrecy doesn't seem
dialog: to me the essence of Tolstoy's
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: But you'll admit, you're no
dialog: expert.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Yes, I...I'll see you in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: If we're spared.

text: The sun rising. Already, disciples are at work the gardens.
scene_heading: 20 INT. TELYATINKI. VALENTIN'S ROOM. MORNING. 20
text: Valentin sleeps in his tiny room. A knock on the door.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Come in.
text: A lovely girl at his door. She's tall, twenties, high cheek
text: bones, short blonde hair. This is MASHA.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I've brought you a glass of tea.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: That's very kind of you.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: It's your first day. Enjoy it.
text: She sits on the bed. He's a little taken aback, not used to
text: this degree of familiarity. It makes no impression on
dialog: Masha.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: You met Sergeyenko?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Last night.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Ad what do you think?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
text: He seems very sincere.
text: Masha hands him his tea.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Thank you. Why are you laughing?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Say that again.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I said he seems very... Why?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Is that what you think?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I just arrived...What's your
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Masha. But you should still say
dialog: what you think. Not just about
dialog: him. We all should.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Thank you for the tea.
text: Their eyes meet, hold. Valentin's discomfort increases.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Tomorrow you can make your own.
text: She walks to the door, turns to see him still watching her.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: He's a sorry old tight-assed
dialog: stick in the mud...but yes, he's
dialog: sincere.
scene_heading: 21 EXT. ROAD TO YASNAYA POLYANA. DAY. 21
text: A modest horse drawn cart. Valentin sits beside the driver,
text: contemplates the birch trees that line the road, the long

dialog: sky.
speaker_heading: 22 OMITTED 22
scene_heading: 23 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ENTRY WAY/STAIRS. DAY. 23
text: Valentin stands in the entry way, waiting. He looks lost.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Hello...hello...
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You're the new secretary.
text: He looks up to see Sasha examining him from the landing
dialog: above.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Papa's out. You can wait in the
dialog: library. Ivan will show you up.
text: She disappears. He hears a door close. He notices a surly
text: house servant, IVAN, who, inexplicably, leads a goat
text: through the house. He points upstairs and walks away.
scene_heading: 24 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY. 24
text: Alone now among Tolstoy's books, Valentin makes his way
text: slowly to a writing table, the holy of holies, on which War
text: and Peace and Anna Karenina were written. He runs his hand
text: along the old wood top. Emboldened by a backward glance, he
text: sits in Tolstoy's chair. Before him are stacks of letters,
text: pens and pencils, a pot of India ink. There's a notebook
text: lying open. He leans forward to read it. A noise in the
text: hall stops him.
text: Tolstoy enters from the dining room, red cheeked, beard
text: dripping wet, the energy of a man ten years younger than he
text: is. Valentin stands.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I'm glad you're here. So glad.
dialog: 16.
text: He tromps across the room, kisses the boy enthusiastically
text: on both cheeks. Valentin is overcome by the great man's
dialog: warmth.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm... I'm... Here is-
text: Valentin interrupts himself with a sneeze.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: God bless you.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm sorry. Sometimes I...
text: Valentin pulls out a letter of introduction. Tolstoy takes
text: it out and puts it down without a glance.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Vladimir Grigorevich has already
dialog: written about you at length. I
dialog: need your help badly. The
dialog: manifesto against the government
dialog: is hard work. They commit their
dialog: idiotic abuses faster than I can
dialog: catalogue them...and the new
dialog: book...
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: He told me about it...It's very
dialog: exciting.
text: Tolstoy nods.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I've become convinced that all
dialog: the world's religions have a
dialog: single organizing principle. Can
dialog: you guess what it is? Love!
dialog: Love! Simple... Now, I want to
dialog: talk about you. How are you? How
dialog: was your journey? Come, sit
dialog: down.
text: Tolstoy sits on the old sofa. Valentin follows suit.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: You know, I was born on this
dialog: sofa...
text: Valentin gets right back up. Tolstoy laughs, pats the sofa.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Sit. Sit.
text: Valentin sits down.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Myself, my brother, my children,
dialog: at least five or six of them,
dialog: right here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now, I've read your essays. How`s
dialog: your work progressing?
text: Valentin looks into the great man's kind old face. He tries
text: to speak but he's overcome with emotion and begins to weep.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: My boy, what is it?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I upset you in some way. Was it
dialog: the sofa? It's only a sofa.
text: Valentin shakes his head, smiling through his tears.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm very happy. You are very
dialog: kind. I'm no one and you are...
dialog: you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask
dialog: me about my work.
text: Tolstoy takes Valentin's hand, sits him back on sofa.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: You rest for a moment and I'll

dialog: because there's work for both of
dialog: us together.

scene_heading: 28 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY. 28
text: Sofya, Sasha, Valentin, ANDREY, Tolstoy's son, and Tolstoy
text: all clustered around a table taking tea. Dushan stands near
text: the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: These people have nothing.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: It really is the most
dialog: extraordinary thing.
text: Absolutely ignoring him.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: It's not for lack of land that
dialog: the muzhiks live in poverty.
dialog: They have no will power and they
dialog: drink too much.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I'm not suggesting they be given
dialog: land. Private property is the
dialog: root of the problem... We should
dialog: be giving ours away.
speaker_heading: ANDREY
dialog: Give it to whom?
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: It's all ridiculous. You think
dialog: that poverty makes the peasants
text: somehow morally superior.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I believe that wealth corrupts us
dialog: all, yes I do.
text: A pause. Valentin fills the silence.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: It's a keystone of the movement.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Oh, I know all about the
dialog: movement.
text: A pause. Valentin notices that people from the front lawn
dialog: have moved up to watch all this. Life in the fishbowl, the
text: Tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: If the peasants had money, they
dialog: wouldn't surround themselves, as
dialog: we do, with footmen costing ten
dialog: rubles a month.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: No, they'd spend it on drink and
dialog: whores.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Valentin Fedorovich, do you think
dialog: fifty years from now, people will
text: eat while grown men walk around
dialog: and wait on them hand and foot?
dialog: 19.
text: Valentin doesn't know what to say. A giggle from Dushan.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Oh, that's good...that's good.
text: Dushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get
text: down Tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table.
text: Sofya flushes with anger.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I think...(sneeze)
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Stop scribbling!
dialog: (points to her husband)
dialog: You all think he's Christ, don't
dialog: you? He thinks he's Christ.
text: There is an awkward pause.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: I'm not...I don't believe Leo
dialog: Nikolayevich is Christ. Christ is
dialog: Christ but...
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: But what?
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: I believe he's one of the
text: prophets. God speaks through him.
dialog: I recognize the cadence in his
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: This is unbearable. No wonder I
dialog: feel lonely. I'm surrounded by
dialog: morrons.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Mama, you're being ridiculous.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Am I? I sit here and listen to
dialog: this talk of love and God and
dialog: equality, knowing full well that
dialog: Count Generosity here is fully
dialog: prepared to give away everything
dialog: we have.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: (exhausted)
dialog: You keep going on like that...Why
dialog: do you think we should profit
dialog: from the work I´m doing which is
dialog: only meant for the sake of the
dialog: people.
dialog: 20.
text: She turns to see Dushan scribbling again.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: STOP IT! STOP WRITING NOW!
text: Valentin glances at Sasha, uncomfortable at these
text: outbursts. A long pause. Dushan tries to relieve the
dialog: tension.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: In defense of my gift, let me
dialog: demonstrate. It's quite
dialog: remarkable, really.
text: He gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on
text: the record. What comes forth is not music, but Tolstoy's
dialog: voice.
text: It is a recording of a recent speech against capital
text: punishment. His voice booms, tinny and distorted. Dushan
text: walks to the machine, stares at it in awe. Valentin is
text: completely caught up in the technology.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: It's your voice. It's wonderful.
text: They all listen for a moment, look to Tolstoy for a
dialog: response.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: It's tiresome. Another
dialog: remarkable invention will
dialog: supercede it.
text: Valentin blushes and looks at the table. Dushan tries to
dialog: hide his disappointment.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Please excuse me.
text: Tolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn.
text: Dushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes. Tea
text: spills. Valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of
dialog: irritable blessings.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Leo Nikolayevich is something of
dialog: a Luddite, I fear.
text: Sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the
text: gramophone, replaces it with another Dushan has brought.
text: Suddenly, the air is filled with the final duet from
text: Mozart's Il Nozze di Figaro. She returns to her place.
text: There is a long moment where all take in the sublimity of
text: it. Tolstoy walks slowly back to the table. He stands
text: completely still. Tears fill his eyes and roll down his
dialog: cheeks.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Oh, that´s better. That´s nice.
dialog: Very nice indeed.
text: Sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face.
text: Valentin watches as they embrace.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN (O.S.)
dialog: Do your parents often speak to
dialog: each other so...bluntly?
scene_heading: 29 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. EVENING. 29
text: Across from Tolstoy's writing desk is Sasha's world, a
text: makeshift office lined with more bookcases where she does
dialog: her work, sending cables, editing manuscripts, answering
text: endless stacks of mail. Valentin sits near her, learning
dialog: the ropes.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: My mother doesn't understand my
dialog: father's goals, not since his
dialog: work as a novelist became
dialog: secondary. His commitment to
text: the spiritual life offends her.
dialog: They've fought about it for
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm sure she means well.
text: Sasha just looks at him.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Your father is the greatest
dialog: writer in the world.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Quite.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I mean to say, I feel privileged
dialog: to be here. It's an... honor.
text: Valentin feels himself slip further into mundanity. Sasha
text: goes back to her letter. Valentin SNEEZES.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: God Bless You.
text: They read together for a moment. He sneezes again.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: God bless you.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm sorry. Sometimes I sneeze
dialog: when I'm nervous.
text: She regards him like an animal in the zoo. Ivan appears at
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: IVAN
text: It´s a note, for him.
text: He nods toward Valentin.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Well, give it to him then.
text: Valentin reads the note.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: It´s from your mother. She wants
dialog: to see me.
dialog: As Valentin goes,
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: She is looking for allies. Pay
dialog: attention. This is war.
scene_heading: 30 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT. 30
text: Sofya is settled on a divan in a small room off the dining
text: room. Valentin sits beside her holding a glass of tea.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
text: I see a fine young man before me.
dialog: Clear eyes. Nice features, rather
text: handsome in a peculiar way.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Thank you, Countess...
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Call me Sofya Andreyevna. We
dialog: don't stand on formality here, as
dialog: you may have observed.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Many young men ruin their looks
dialog: by loose living. You're a real
dialog: Tolstoyan, I can tell!
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I admire your husband immensely.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: That's excellent. He likes that.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: His ideas are beautiful...social
dialog: justice...the idea...Don't you
dialog: think?
text: Sofya drains her tea cup, signals for more.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: He's very grateful for the help
dialog: you've been giving him. He told
dialog: me so himself. I think it
text: surprises him that a young man
dialog: would be so diligent. When he was
dialog: your age, he was whoring in the
dialog: Caucasus.
text: Valentin's eyes are wide. She nods.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: He wrote it all down. He even
dialog: gave me a copy, so I could read
dialog: all the details...
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You've read War and Peace?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Many times... twice.
text: Sofya smiles at his honesty.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: When he was writing it, long
dialog: before Chertkov created that
text: monstrosity at Telyatinki, before
dialog: all this "new religion" and
dialog: revolutionary nonsense...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What do you think of Chertkov, by
dialog: the way?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: He's given me an extraordinary
dialog: opportunity.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: But you see what a fool he is, a
dialog: self-serving puritanical idiot. I
dialog: have to say, it's been extremely
dialog: pleasant since they've locked him
text: in his house.
text: Sofya smiles. Valentin is nonplussed by her directness.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: When my husband was writing it,
dialog: in the mid-sixties, he'd bring me
dialog: pages to re-copy everyday.
dialog: I was the only one who could read
dialog: his handwriting. I could read his
dialog: intentions, too. Afternoons, we'd
dialog: drink tea and discuss changes.
dialog: "Natasha wouldn't say that to
dialog: Prince Andrey," or "Pierre's too
dialog: simple here. He's not stupid."
text: She smiles at the memory.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: But I don't count anymore.
text: Silence. She sips her tea. She glances out the door to see
text: Sasha hovering nearby. Listening? Sasha walks away.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You must help me, Valentin
dialog: Fedorovich. I want only what is
dialog: best for my husband and my
dialog: family. I could tolerate the
dialog: situation if it only concerned me
dialog: What I can not do is sit back
dialog: while they steal my children's
dialog: inheritance. Do you know I was
dialog: the only person. I could
dialog: understand his intention.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I don't believe anyone wants to
dialog: do that.
text: Sofya gives him a condescending smile. She produces a
text: package from the table beside her, hands it to him.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: I have a little gift for you
text: He opens it, extracts a small leather bound book. He stares
dialog: at it.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: It's a diary.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Everyone should always keep a
dialog: diary.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: It's a very popular activity
dialog: around your husband.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You're teasing me, but I trust
dialog: you'll write the truth.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: That may not be so easy.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Nonsense. You've been listening
dialog: to your friends at Telyatinki...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Write what you see. That's always
dialog: the place to begin.
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: What. You. See.
text: Valentin fingers the package, stifles a sneeze.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: More tea?
scene_heading: 31 EXT. TELYATINKI COMPOUND. DAY 31
text: Valentin rides into the compound. A number of the disciples
text: are outside working. There is the ringing of metal on
text: wood. He looks for the source. As the way clears a little,
text: he sees Masha chopping away with an axe. He stops his horse
dialog: to watch her.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: You're finished for the day?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: He didn't need me this afternoon.
text: He gets down off his horse. Masha continues to chop. He
text: picks up an axe, holds it awkwardly.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Leo Nikolayevich disapproves of
dialog: women doing physical labor.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Don't you find that reactionary?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: No, I find it sweet. I find you
dialog: reactionary.
text: She laughs. Valentin picks up a log, sets it on end and
text: begins to chop. He doesn't do it well. Masha smiles at his
dialog: struggle.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: He admires you, I believe.
dialog: What's she saying?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Sergeyenko told me. He's
dialog: miserable about it.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Tolstoy's kind to everyone.
text: The log is stuck to the blade of his axe. He's really
text: struggling now.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: What do you talk about when
dialog: you're with him?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why are you blushing?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: We talk about me.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: He wants to know everything about
dialog: me, my parents, my relations with
dialog: women, my experience of god -
text: He looks up to see Masha smiling at him.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: And what relations are these?
text: Valentin blushes, goes back to trying to chopping. Almost
text: immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe.
text: He bangs it, bangs it trying to free it. He glances up to
text: see her still looking at him. He pounds again and again.
text: She stops, reaches for his axe, touching him as she does.
text: She lifts the big axe, log and all, above her head,
text: bringing it down hard. The log splits. She hands the axe to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I had a lover before I came
dialog: here... headmaster of a school
dialog: where I taught. He was married -
dialog: happily married. It was
dialog: difficult. We could make love
dialog: only at school.
text: This is somehow more than Valentin had bargained for.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: At school?
speaker_heading: MASHA
text: In the gymnasium, after the girls
text: had gone. There were straw mats
text: on the floor.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I see...
dialog: 27.
text: He looks away to hide his confusion.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Have I upset you?
text: He looks at her.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: No...I appreciate your frankness
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: But you disapprove of me. I see
dialog: it in your eyes.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I don't. Not at all...I think
dialog: sexual activity...how men and
dialog: women combine their physical
dialog: parts is completely neutral.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Listen to you. You're a prig.
dialog: Just like Sergeyenko. Why else
dialog: would they have hired you?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: That's not fair
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I don't care if it's fair. It's
dialog: true...neutral...my God...
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm going.
text: He puts down the axe.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Do as you like.
text: She goes back to chopping. We track in front of him as he
text: walks toward the house. The chopping stops.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Valentin Fedorovich.
text: He stops, relieved and turns to face her.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: You forgot your horse.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Yes. You know, I think that I...
dialog: never mind.
text: He hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her. Her back
text: is to him. She begins to chop again. The color rises in his
text: face as he tries to salvage a little dignity.
dialog: 28.
text: He grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings,
text: trips in a ditch, almost falls flat. Red faced, he rights
text: himself. The chopping behind him remains constant.
text: Sergeyenko watches him from the porch.
scene_heading: 32 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY 32

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I couldn't write. I was

dialog: dream last night, about a Tartar
dialog: girl I knew in the war.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: A girl who died?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: No, no...A girl I had sexual
dialog: intercourse with... Sometimes we
dialog: did it twice a day.
text: Valentin sneezes.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: God bless...I've never forgotten
dialog: our time together, the position
dialog: of our bodies, the taste of
dialog: her...
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: You shouldn't torture yourself.
dialog: It was a long time ago.
text: Tolstoy laughs out loud.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Torture? You are a virgin,
dialog: aren't you.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I try to...you know, to...
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: To be what, a good Tolstoyan?
text: Tolstoy smiles.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: You see, I myself am not a very
dialog: good Tolstoyan. You should think
dialog: twice about asking my advice
dialog: about anything... Torture...
dialog: (he laughs)
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Kalya, her name was...She's an
text: old woman now, white hair, old
dialog: body like me. She'd hardly
dialog: remember my name, I suspect. She
dialog: may even be dead. (beat) Do you
dialog: think that meant something?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I mean that little romance. Was
dialog: there some meaning to it?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: It´s interesting. I think you
dialog: would say..I mean, I´ve read
dialog: where you say that the physical
dialog: body isn´t real. That it´s all an
dialog: illusion.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I say lots of things. What do you
dialog: say? What do you think?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I...I don´t know.

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I don´t know, either.
text: He inhales deeply.

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Smell that...
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Lilac?
text: He looks up as he hears Sasha off screen. "Papa. Papa."
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Precisely. It's lilac. The

speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: You send me never ending

dialog: That's all very interesting but

dialog: she's committed to undermining

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: It's not quite so obvious to me.

speaker_heading: CHERTKOV

speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Is it alright?
text: He can't speak. Only nod. He bites his lip as she slips him
text: into her and begins to rock. The pleasure is too much, and
text: he comes too quickly. She falls forward on him, begins to
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What...what is it?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: You really are a virgin.

speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I am awake.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN

speaker_heading: VALENTIN

speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: You don´t follow any of the

text: Masha smiles.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: You mean, why does someone who
dialog: doesn't follow the rules come to
dialog: a place like this?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: ..it's not about rules. Not for

speaker_heading: VALENTIN

speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO

speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO

speaker_heading: VALENTIN

speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO (O.S.)
dialog: Yes..and tell Maria Filipovna we

text: They look at each other.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: If I see her I will...
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO (O.S.)
dialog: If you see her...yes. And if

text: Valentin is up, immediately.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Let me go out first...give me
dialog: five minutes...
text: Masha just looks at him.
scene_heading: 50 EXT. TELYATINKI COMPOUND. DAY. 50
text: A Tolstoyan photo op. A delegation of orphans have come to
text: pay their respects to Tolstoy. He sits in a chair beside
text: Chertkov beneath a large banner : "Leo Tolstoy, Friend of
text: the People.". Behind him, the disciples lay out a
text: vegetarian feast on a plank table. Photographers and a
dialog: cinematographer are strategically positioned to record the
dialog: event.
text: Each child gives Tolstoy a flower. Chertkov, in turn, hands
text: each child a photograph of the Count giving money to the
dialog: poor.
text: Valentin enters, flushed and blushing. He pauses beside
text: Dushan who records the scene in his diary, tears in his
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Look at the love in him, like
dialog: Jesus..suffering the
dialog: children...all that...
text: Tolstoy greets a little boy affectionately, rubs his
text: knuckles over the boy's shaved head. A little girl
text: approaches, takes a photograph. He bends forward to kiss
text: her head but she pulls away.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: An old man is a very ugly thing.
text: Tolstoy sees Valentin, lights up.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: My dear boy. Come and kiss me.
text: Valentin, beet red, goes to him. He is warmly embraced.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Now, who is this? Maria
dialog: Filipovna.
text: Masha comes to stand beside him. She glances at Valentin
text: but he won't make eye contact with her.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: You're both looking so well. Life
dialog: here at Telyatinki obviously
dialog: agrees with you.
text: Valentin sneezes mightily, moves a little away.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: God bless you, boy. What are you
dialog: nervous about, now? Sit down. Sit
dialog: down.
text: Valentin takes the chair beside him.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Dear Masha, Valentin tells me
dialog: you're the great treasure of
dialog: Telyatinki. He claims you're a
dialog: very gifted teacher.
text: Sergeyenko lifts an eyebrow "Indeed.". Valentin is in
dialog: agony.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: We're happy to have you with us.
text: Tolstoy notices a mosquito on Valentin's cheek. He takes
text: the bug between his big fingers, squeezes until it pops.
text: Chertkov watches in horror, whispers loudly.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: What do you mean?
text: He motions to the photographers.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: You've killed a living thing.
text: Chertkov hears a laugh behind him. It is Masha who has
dialog: over heard the whole thing.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Do you have something to say?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: It's absurd. That's all.
text: Chertkov is taken aback. Valentin stares at her.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I'm sorry but- It's a mosquito.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Forgive him. He can't help it.
dialog: He's a better Tolstoyan than I
dialog: am.
text: She can't help laughing again. Valentin sees the color rise
text: in Chertkov's face.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: It's not the message we want to
dialog: send.
text: Sasha suddenly appears. She holds a cable in her hand.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: From my mother "Nerves dreadful.

text: another cable. Tolstoy gestures for him to read it aloud.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: From Sofya Andreyevna. "I beg
dialog: you. Stop. Unwell. Stop. Hurry
dialog: back."
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Who taught her to use that damned
dialog: machine?
text: Valentin starts to sneeze, stifles it, starts again,
text: stifles, starts, explodes. Guilty.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Perhaps Sasha's right.
dialog: Encouraging this may not be the
dialog: best thing.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: It's a trick, Papa. She'll drain
dialog: you. You'll be miserable.
text: Tolstoy looks from one to the other, gets up from his

speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Then, let me go with you.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: No, my dear, I'll go alone.

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Sofya.
text: A sly smile on her lips, the tension gone from her face,
text: she seems twenty years younger.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Sofya, are you ill?
text: She rolls toward him making it clear she's quite naked
text: under the sheets. This is no sick bed.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: I'm fine...now that you're home.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: It's no good, you know, all this.
dialog: You frightened everyone.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Did I really? I don't believe
dialog: it. Not you. I'm your little
dialog: bird. You know the sounds I
dialog: make.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: That was some sort of love call?
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: It brought you back to me.
text: She reaches out her hand to him.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Come out of the dark... where I
dialog: can see you.
text: He takes a step toward her, then stops.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Why? Why? Why, do you do it? We
dialog: live in the country and you
dialog: insist on making it an opera
dialog: house. What's wrong with a little
dialog: peace now and then?
text: Sofya laughs.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Look at me. This is who I am.
dialog: This is what you married. We're
dialog: older, maybe we're old, but I'm
dialog: still your little chicken
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're still my big cock.
text: She smiles at him.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Let me make you crow.
text: A pause, then a huge laugh comes up from the very center of
text: him. He twists his neck, thrusts his head upward, crows
text: like a rooster.
text: He virtually runs to her, embraces her, kisses her. She is
text: a giddy girl in his arms. He breaks the embrace and begins
text: strutting around the room.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Let me make you sing.
text: He takes her in his arms, again, begins to kiss her neck.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Do you love me?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I want you to love me.
text: He stops kissing her, looks her in the eye. Then, another
text: loud crow. Laughing, they fall into each other again.

scene_heading: 54 EXT. TELYATINKI. PORCH. NIGHT. 54
text: Valentin sits by himself on the porch, writes in his diary.
text: Down below, some of the disciples listen to peasants play
text: music around a bonfire. A voice from the darkness.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I'm not supposed to do this
dialog: either.
text: He locates the speaker by the glow of her lit cigarette.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Masha. You are not supposed to
dialog: smoke at Telyatinki.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: You wouldn't look at me.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: It was difficult in front of the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: But it wasn't difficult in your
dialog: bed... When it was only you and
dialog: me in front of God.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm not sure I was conscious of
dialog: God.
text: Masha emerges from the shadows, but keeps her distance.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: So, I made you forget God?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Yes, only for a moment. You
dialog: forgot your rules and remembered
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: You make it sound very simple.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: It is simple. What we did is what
dialog: men and women do, have done, will
dialog: continue doing. What could be
dialog: more simple? We touched each
dialog: other-- stayed close together.
dialog: Something passed between us.
dialog: Something real. That is a
dialog: betrayal of what? Of nothing.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: MASHA (cont'd)
dialog: But you're afraid... All your
dialog: ideas. What are you afraid of?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm afraid I've hurt you, haven´t

speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: No. I feel a little sad, but it

scene_heading: 56 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. BACK TERRACE. DAY. 56
text: She comes through the dining room to find Tolstoy on the

text: a cup of tea in front of him.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Good morning, my darling? Do you
dialog: mind if I join you?
dialog: Without looking up
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Of course, my dear.
text: He continues to write. She watches him for a long moment.
text: She opens her diary and begins to write as well.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: It's quite insane, my darling.
dialog: Everyone is making fun of you.
text: He looks up.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: She continues to write.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Even the muzhiks. I heard them
text: laughing in the barn.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: About what?
text: Sofya looks at him knowingly.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Laughing about what?
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: I don't want to ruin last night.
text: She sips her tea, goes back to her writing. A pause. He
text: follows suit. After a moment...
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Laughing about the fact that
dialog: you've developed a senile crush
text: on a fat middle aged flatterer.
dialog: Your passion for Chertkov has
text: become a standing joke.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I have a great affection for
dialog: Vladimir Grigorivich. Let them
dialog: laugh if they find it amusing.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: But it's not amusing, darling.
dialog: It's sick. It's not normal. You
dialog: hang on his every word.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: We have a great deal in common.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You have nothing in common. You
dialog: are a genius. He's a sycophant
dialog: and a pervert.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Because he understands what I'm
dialog: trying to do? Because he tries
dialog: to help me accomplish it?
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: He is using you. You just can't
text: seem to see it.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: This is absolute nonsense.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: That bold, obese, idiotic man.
dialog: You treat him...
text: He turns to her...his face red with anger and frustration.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: It's impossible for you not to
dialog: distract me. Let me alone... for
dialog: God's sake. You're like a spoiled
dialog: child.
dialog: 45.

speaker_heading: SOFYA

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Of course, I do.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Then why would you betray me?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Because of the will?
scene_heading: 57A INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. ENTRY WAY/STAIRS/LANDING. DAY 57A
text: Tolstoy, taken aback, says nothing.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: The new will.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
text: There is no new will.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Does Chertkov have it?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: There's no new will.
text: He walks up the stairs. She follows.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: But that's why he's come back.
dialog: You talk about it, you and your
dialog: boyfriend. You plan for it. You
dialog: have no heart for the people who
dialog: really love you. You'd rather be
text: seduced by charlatans and deluded
dialog: by flatterers, all in the name of
dialog: love....You can't even love your

dialog: love me.

dialog: Tolstoy's wife becomes Anna
dialog: Karenina herself! See how the
dialog: papers will like that!
text: As he goes, we hear.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY (O.S.)
dialog: This is unbearable. You don't

speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: How does she know it even exists?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: She claims Leo Nikolayevich told

speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
text: He is obviously not thinking

text: up with her petty grasping.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: It doesn't seem petty to me.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: He`s her life. The work, in her
dialog: mind, is theirs...together.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: And you're her advocate? You've
dialog: been taken in by her celebrity. I
dialog: worried about this.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN

speaker_heading: CHERTKOV

speaker_heading: CHERTKOV

dialog: It's a problem of the wax.

speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Let me get to the point. Vladimir
dialog: Grigorivich, I don't wish to be
dialog: your enemy. I'm delighted that my
dialog: husband has a friend who
dialog: understands and shares his
dialog: ideals. All I want is what's
dialog: reasonable - an opportunity to
dialog: evaluate the new will. If you
dialog: agree, I'm sure we can be
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: You're very kind. Sofya
dialog: Andreyevna. But I can't help you.
dialog: Not without specific instructions
dialog: from your husband.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: (to Bulgakov)
dialog: Leo Nikolayevich has agreed,
dialog: hasn't he Val-
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: No witness you produce will

dialog: certainly talk to Leo
dialog: Nikolayevich at the first
dialog: opportunity.
text: Sofya is livid.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Very well.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I want us to be friends, too,

speaker_heading: VALENTIN

speaker_heading: VALENTIN

text: Another P.O.V. - someone watches her from the trees.
text: As Masha wets a cloth, puts it around her neck. Suddenly
text: someone grabs her from behind. She screams, wrestle her

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Sorry, sorry, I'll... I didn't

speaker_heading: MASHA

speaker_heading: VALENTIN

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: But today I could hardly

speaker_heading: VALENTIN

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I think I've confused you. I've

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: No. No. You didn´t confuse me..I

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I love you, Masha!
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Maybe you could help me a little.
text: In silence, he gets the filled buckets balanced on the

speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I think about you all the time.
dialog: In my heart I´ve comitted the act

dialog: room to avoid being seen
scene_heading: 68 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. HALLWAY. DAY 68
text: Sofya approaches the door, listens. She can make out only a
text: few words. "Mama cannot find out", Chertkov shushing her,

scene_heading: 69 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY. 69
text: Chertkov, Sasha, Dushan, Valentin and Tolstoy sit in a

text: looks at the floor.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I hate to say it but the Countess
dialog: has become more and more
dialog: dangerous.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Not dangerous... She's concerned
dialog: for the welfare of the family.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: (to Tolstoy)
dialog: And we're concerned for the
dialog: welfare of mankind.
dialog: (to Bulgakov)
dialog: Take this down.
text: Valentin records the conversation in his diary.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: It´s a terrible thing you ask. I

scene_heading: 71 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY. 71
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: You've been more than reasonable.
dialog: She already controls the income
dialog: from your property.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Listen to him, papa. He has our
dialog: best interests at heart.
text: Tolstoy looks at Valentin, who looks at the floor.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: We're speaking only of the rights
dialog: to your words, your ideas.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV (cont'd)
dialog: With all love and respect, the
dialog: Countess is too interested in
dialog: making a profit from your work.
scene_heading: 72 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SECOND STORY BALCONY. DAY. 72
text: Sofya moves along the narrow ledge as if it's a perfectly
text: normal activity.. Looking down, she sees a couple of
text: gawkers watching her from the lawn. She shoos them away.
scene_heading: 73 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY. 73
text: Valentin turns his head. Did he hear something?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: She's my wife. She´s part of me.
dialog: We've been together now, so many
dialog: years....
text: Chertkov drives the point home.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: But you're more than a husband
dialog: and father. She must understand
dialog: that.
dialog: The best interests of the people
dialog: are one with your own. You
dialog: belong to them.
text: Valentin glances up...and is shocked to see SOFYA LOOKING
text: IN AT THE STUDY WINDOW. She disappears.
scene_heading: 74 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SECOND STORY BALCONY. DAY. 74

speaker_heading: CHERTKOV

dialog: isn't ill.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: It´s sadly more than possible.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: I know it´s hard for you, papa.
dialog: But we must be realistic.
text: We pan to the french doors to see Sofya furious face as she
text: listens to the betrayal.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV (O.S.)
dialog: Do you really think she's fit to
dialog: control the final disposition of
dialog: the will?
text: We pan back to the conspirators. Before Tolstoy can
text: respond, Sofya charges into the room. As she does, she
text: steps on the hem of her long dressing gown and ends up
text: sprawled on the floor. The conspirators just stare at her.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: How dare you?
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You're all plotting against me.
dialog: In my own house, too. I bear you
dialog: thirteen children. How can you
dialog: betray me like this?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Someone help me up.
text: No one moves. Tolstoy slumps in his chair.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Give everything you've got to
dialog: him, your fat little catamite.
dialog: "What will it be, my dearest
dialog: dear, my Vladimir Grigorivich? My
dialog: wife's heart on a platter? Her
dialog: kidneys? With salt? But of
dialog: course, my dear Chertkov,
dialog: whatever pleases you. The china.
dialog: The estate. Permanent copyright
dialog: on everything I've ever written?
dialog: Anything for you, my love."
dialog: 56.
text: Her eye falls on Dushan, who very unfortunately, has chosen
dialog: to take this down in his diary.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Give me that. Give it to me, you
dialog: little weasel.
text: She grabs the offending volume. The struggle begins.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Please, Countess Sofya-
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Mama, please...
text: She rips the book away and after brandishing it above her
text: head, throws it through the open doors with a guttural,

speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Now...
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: (mumbles)
dialog: Can I not...Can I not have...
text: His face is red, his body rigid with anger.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: You'll kill him, Mama. That's
dialog: what you want, isn't it? You want
dialog: him to die!"
text: She helps him up, takes him to his bedroom. Valentin
text: follows.
text: She looks at Chertkov.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You! Don't think you deceive me
dialog: for one little moment! I know
dialog: exactly what you're doing. I
dialog: want to see the will. It's my
dialog: right, in the name of god.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: What are you afraid of?
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You. I'm afraid of you.
text: Chertkov looks at her with undisguised disgust.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: The press is bloodthirsty. Had I
dialog: wished, I could've demolished you
dialog: and your family. You make it
dialog: easy.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Tell them anything you like. Go
dialog: ahead. Ruin us.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I have too much respect for Leo
dialog: Nikolayevich. You're lucky.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Why can't my husband see you for
dialog: what you are?
text: Chertkov's face is red. He starts to speak, stops. He walks
text: to the door, then very deliberately.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: If I had a wife like you, I would
dialog: have blown my brains out long
dialog: ago.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or gone to America.
text: He leaves the room. Sofya sinks back to the floor, a flower
text: wilting. She begins to weep. An Aria from Madame Butterfly
dialog: comes over
scene_heading: 78 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DINING ROOM. NIGHT. 78
text: From a record on the gramophone. The table is set for ten,
text: although no one is at dinner but Sofya Andreyevna and
text: Valentin. He is visibly uncomfortable. An awkward silence.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I hope you're feeling better.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Do you like the opera?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I took singing lessons for years.
dialog: I thought about a career in
dialog: music. The only thing I lacked,
dialog: in the end, was talent.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry about everything.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: This aria is very beautiful.. It
text: is about a woman who is abandoned
dialog: by the man who loves

dialog: that...in the opera.
text: A long pause. The clink of soup spoons. Tolstoy enters.
text: He doesn't sit.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Our life together has become
dialog: intolerable.
text: Stifling a sneeze, Valentin gets up to leave,tries to flee
dialog: the inappropriateness of all this.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Sit down, Valentin.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Really, I'm expected at
dialog: Telyatinki.
text: She waves it off.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: No, no, no. Enjoy your dinner.
dialog: We've had a disagreement. No more
dialog: than any other married couple.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I didn't come for more
dialog: recrimination. Despite good cause
dialog: for alienation between us, I have
dialog: never stopped loving you.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Of course...
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: God knows you don't make it easy.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Why should it be easy? I'm the
dialog: work of your life. You're the
dialog: work of mine. Its what love is.
dialog: Aside to Valentin.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
text: Everything with him is hysterics
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I should go.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Sit down.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, this is what love is. Does
dialog: that surprise you, boy?
text: They both look at him
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I thought it might be quieter,
dialog: but-
dialog: 59.
text: He sneezes violently.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY/SOFYA
dialog: God bless you
text: Tolstoy turns to Sofya.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: He's right, though. If we cannot
dialog: live a decent, quiet life, if I
dialog: cannot work, if I cannot find
dialog: some peace, I shall simply go
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Go? Where?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Not to Chertkov, but I shall go.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Go where?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Dushan says you're killing me.
text: Sofya rises up in cold rage.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Then go! Go! Anywhere you please!
text: She smashes a plate on the table to punctuate it and
dialog: another and another.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: I hate you. I hate what you've
dialog: become.
text: She picks up another plate, lets it fall. Now, she acts as
text: if she's choking or gasping for breath.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Countess...Are you alright?
text: She fights with her collar, rips open the front of her
dialog: dress.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: DUSHAN!!!
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You'll destroy me.
text: Dushan runs into the room. Sofya continues to tear at her
text: clothes, stops, begins to pant, then falls to the floor in
text: a faint.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Is she alright?
text: Tolstoy tries to answer, but is overcome by a coughing fit.
text: Dushan starts toward him but Tolstoy waves him in the
text: direction of Sofya. He kneels beside her.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Sofya! Open your eyes.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: My back. My back... I'm hurting.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: You're lying on a fork. Sit up
dialog: and you'll improve
dialog: markedly...Valentin, help to get
dialog: her upstairs, would you?
text: Valentin helps Sofya to her feet. Dushan gets up himself
text: and walks to Tolstoy.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: She's alright. I'm more concerned
dialog: for you... We should all go to
dialog: bed before something else
dialog: happens.

scene_heading: 81 INT. TELYATINKI. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 81
text: It's late. The house is quiet. Valentin walks into the
text: kitchen to see Masha washing the dishes. Exhausted, he
text: sits, stares at the floor.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: It was terrible there today...
dialog: between them. They loved each
dialog: other so much, but you see what
dialog: it becomes.
text: She stays at the sink, says nothing.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Masha, what´s the matter?
text: She speaks without turning to him.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I'm going back to Moscow.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What?
text: He gets up, goes to her.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Chertkov spoke with me this
dialog: afternoon. He says I could be
dialog: more useful there...which
dialog: means...
text: Valentin shakes his head. His lip trembles.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: This is him punishing us,
dialog: punishing me for befriending
dialog: Sofya Andreyevna. For not...
dialog: This is Chertkov.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: We've both disappointed him.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I don't care. You can't go away.
dialog: I'll talk to him. I'll make him
dialog: change his mind. i´m going to
dialog: make you stay.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: No, I want to go.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I'm leaving the movement.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: You can´t leave Tolstoy.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I am not. Look, when I read his
dialog: Confession, it moved me, Valya.
dialog: He was searching for freedom.
dialog: Freedom from anger. Freedom from
dialog: attachment. Freedom from all the
dialog: superstition and nonsense of the
dialog: church. It moved me so much. I
dialog: thought that's what it would be
dialog: about. Isn't that what it's
dialog: about? Freedom and love? But
dialog: they mix it all up.
text: Masha reaches out and puts her arms around him. Her head
text: falls against his shoulder.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Come with me. Please.
text: Bulgakov doesn't know what to say. The silence gets more
text: awkward as it gets longer. Slowly, she disengages herself
text: from him,looks him in the eye. She nods.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I'm going to my room.
text: As she starts away.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Don't leave me, Masha...
dialog: I need you.
text: She turns back for a moment.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: I know you do...I know.
text: Then she's gone.
scene_heading: 82 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SOFYA'S BEDROOM/HALLWAY. DAY. 82
text: Sofya in her bed. A team of doctors hover over her. One of
text: them peers into her eyes with a sextant-like instrument.
text: We move into the hall to find DR. ROSSOLIMO, an expert in
text: mental illness, conferring in the hall with Tolstoy and
dialog: Dushan.
speaker_heading: ROSSOLIMO
dialog: I believe the Countess suffers
dialog: from a mental degeneracy,
text: paranoic and hysterical, chiefly
dialog: the former.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Yes.
text: The doctor walks back into the bedroom. Tolstoy red in the
text: face, walks away down the hall. Dushan catches him.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Why did you bring him here?
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: He's an old friend, you know,
dialog: from Rome.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: And astoundingly stupid in the
dialog: way of all scientists.
text: Dushan is wounded by his uncharacteristic lack of
dialog: generosity.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I'm sorry, my friend, but this is
dialog: all very upsetting to me.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Yes.
text: Tolstoy sits on a small staircase at the end of the hall.
text: Bulgakov is already there on the step above him.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Take them downstairs. Thank them
dialog: for me. Offer them a drink.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: You'll be alright?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Valentin Fedorovich will stay
dialog: with me, won't you, boy
text: Valentin nods. Dushan goes to collect the doctors.
text: MOMENTS LATER-Tolstoy goes to Sofya's bed. He takes her
text: hand. She looks at him with all the love of a new bride.
text: Tears come to his eyes. He kisses her hand.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Ya...your...your...I can´t

dialog: say? What did you mean?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: You rest now.

scene_heading: 83 EXT. ZASYEKA WOODS. DAY. 83
text: It is an autumn afternoon. Valentin and Tolstoy pick their
text: way through the thick undergrowth.
text: As they come into a clearing. Valentin is surprised to see
text: a portable table and several chairs set up like lawyers
text: office in the middle of the wood. Sergeyenko fiddles with a
text: piece of paper on the desk. Chertkov comes toward them.
text: Tolstoy stops his horse. He turns to Valentin with tears in
text: his eyes.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: You see, I no longer feel I have
dialog: a choice in the matter. She
dialog: isn't...
text: He rides forward toward the approaching Chertkov.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Good afternoon, Leo Nikolayevich.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Is it?
text: They help Tolstoy dismount. They lead him to a nearby stump
text: and place the writing board before him. Sergeyenko hands a
text: document to Chertkov who lays it on the board.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: This will insure that the
dialog: complete works will live in the
dialog: public domain.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: Monumentous.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Your work is the birthright of
dialog: the Russian people. Now, they
dialog: possess it forever.
text: Tolstoy looks up at them.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I need a pen.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Of course.
text: Chertkov looks at Sergeyenko who swallows hard. No pen.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: I...uh...
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: What?
text: Sergeyenko moves close to Chertkov, close enough to
dialog: whisper.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: You're a secretary. How can you
dialog: not have a pen?
text: Sergeyenko points at Valentin.
speaker_heading: SERGEYENKO
dialog: He's a secretary, too. Ask him.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Valentin Fedorovich, do you have
dialog: a pen?
dialog: 65.
text: Valentin hesitates for a moment, looks at Tolstoy, seated
text: on the stump, staring into the middle distance.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I do.
text: Valentin fetches it from his satchel.
text: Pen in hand, Tolstoy hovers over the document. A long
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I feel like a conspirator.
text: Sergeyenko laughs. Chertkov glares at him. It's beyond
text: awkward. Valentin looks to the sky, sees the crows
text: circling again.
text: Without further hesitation, Tolstoy picks up the pen and
text: signs the document. Then he moves away from the group.
text: Valentin watches him.
scene_heading: 84 EXT. ZASYEKA WOODS. DAY. 84
text: Valentin and Tolstoy water their horses at a stream.
text: Tolstoy seems weary.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Maybe we should get back. It'll
dialog: be dark soon. May I ask you
dialog: something that has nothing to do
dialog: with work?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Of course, my dear.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Do you love your wife?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: " Your youth and your desire for
dialog: happiness reminds me cruelly of
dialog: my age and the impossibility of
dialog: happiness for me." When I was
dialog: courting Sofya, she was so young
dialog: and pure, it seemed impossible
dialog: that I'd ever have her.
dialog: I didn't want to tell her how I
dialog: felt and I wanted to tell her
dialog: nothing else. So I wrote down a
dialog: string of letters and asked her
dialog: if she could decipher them. She
dialog: looked completely confused,
dialog: thinking it was a game or...
dialog: 66.
text: Tolstoy looks into the middle distance, remembering his
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I gave her one clue. The first
dialog: two Y's, I said, stand for "your
dialog: youth" and then the most
dialog: miraculous thing happened. She
dialog: simply spoke the phrase, my
dialog: phrase...
text: Tolstoy looks at Valentin as if the boy might offer some
dialog: explanation of the miraculous.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: ...as if she had read my mind.
dialog: In that moment, we both knew we
dialog: would always be together. For
dialog: those first years, we were
text: incredibly happy, terrifyingly
dialog: happy.
text: His old eyes are wet.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: And now this.
text: Tolstoy reaches into his boot, extracts his SECRET DIARY.
text: He takes a pen from his shirt, begins to write. Valentin is
text: amazed. HE HAD A PEN ALL THE TIME.
scene_heading: 85 INT. TELYATINKI. MEETING ROOM. NIGHT. 85
text: Valentin exhausted, sits at the long table. Chertkov
text: appears at his office door.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Thank you again, Valentin
dialog: Fedorovich, for your forethought.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm a secretary, after all.
dialog: Chertkov let's it go.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: You know I had thought for a time
dialog: to suggest that Leo Nikolayevich
dialog: look for someone else. But...he
dialog: said no. He said "He reminds me
dialog: of myself when I was young."
text: He goes. After a moment, Valentin gets up and goes to the
dialog: study door.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm leaving Telyatinki.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I am going to Moscow.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: She is leading you around the
dialog: nose.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Look, you say the movement's
dialog: about love-
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Yes... The love he tells us to
dialog: practice, the love of the
dialog: Gospels. Why do I have to explain
dialog: this? Perfect love. Eternal love.
dialog: The love that binds mankind
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: But I've never met mankind, only
dialog: men and women, imperfect men,
dialog: imperfect women.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us
dialog: love can not be weakminded.
dialog: Go. You won't be missed ...a
dialog: naive sentimentalist
text: Valentin looks at him for a long moment, then bursts out
text: laughing, walks away
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Why are you laughing? You think
dialog: I'm ridiculous.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN

text: Tolstoy has fallen asleep at his desk, his SECRET DIARY

text: holds up the letter in her hand.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Lyovochka? Prozeveskeny wants to
dialog: purchase the rights to your work
dialog: after your death.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Then I shall try and die as soon
dialog: as is convenient.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Don't be silly. They've offered

dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: How can you not be pleased?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I don't write for publishers. I
dialog: write for people.
text: He gets up from his desk.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Valentin's in the library. He's
dialog: asked to speak to me.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Splendid...while your wretched
text: family is left to starve.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I don't see anyone starving in
dialog: this house. On the contrary, our
dialog: privilege revolts me.
text: He goes. She calls after him.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: But you're always first to the
dialog: trough...always have been.
text: Sofya sinks into his chair. On the desk is the photograph
text: of herself and Tolstoy that we saw her hang on the wall in
text: the early part of the film. She looks at the wall. There
text: in it's place is the offending photograph of CHERTKOV that
dialog: she had removed earlier.
dialog: 69.
text: She can fix that. But as she picks up the photo of her and
text: her husband, she notices A SMALL VOLUME, THE SECRET DIARY,
text: lying under it. She begins to read.
scene_heading: 90 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY. 90

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Sofya, what are you doing?
text: She turns toward him, waves the gun in his direction.
text: Valentin ducks against the wall.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: How could you do this to me?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: You're not well.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You hurt me again and again. You
dialog: take little pieces of me until I

text: him in silence.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I'd like you to stay here
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Yes, of course.
text: With that, the old man gets up and leaves the room, leaving
text: Valentin in the wreckage of his world.
scene_heading: 93 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. NIGHT. 93
text: The wind blows the trees around the old house. We see a

scene_heading: 94 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. NIGHT. 94
text: Valentin in his makeshift bed.
speaker_heading: SASHA (O.S.)
text: Valentin. Valentin.

speaker_heading: SASHA

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SASHA
text: He´s leaving.
scene_heading: 95 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY'S BEDROOM/STUDY. NIGHT. 95
text: Bags are being prepared. Sasha is packing clothes.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Essentials only. Nothing that

dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Please...we must hurry.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Where will you go?
text: No one responds. Dushan comes to Tolstoy, sits down and
text: begins the ritual taking of the pulse. Meanwhile, Sasha
text: wraps a heavy fur coat around his shoulders. She smiles at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Absolutely essential.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: A lantern, I think. It's very

scene_heading: 96 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. NIGHT. 96
text: The horses are hitched to the droshky, the bags are up on

speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Everything's ready.
text: Dushan climbs into the carriage. Tolstoy turns abruptly and
text: walks back toward the house.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Papa...?
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: He's changed his mind. He's going
text: back to the house.
text: They watch as Tolstoy kneels on the wet grass, bending low
text: to rub his hands against the earth. After a moment,
text: Valentin goes to him, kneels next to him.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Do you want to go back?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: When I was a boy, my brother
dialog: Nikolai once brought me to a
dialog: place when I was a boy. He told
dialog: me he'd found a green stick with
dialog: some words on it... the secret to
dialog: happiness for all men everywhere.
dialog: He hid it in the ground. I looked
dialog: for it very often. I've looked
dialog: for it all these years. I really
dialog: believed I would find it
dialog: here...but I never did.
dialog: 72.
text: Tolstoy looks at him.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: I never did...but this life is
dialog: behind me now.
text: He kisses the ground of his beloved home, gets up and they

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Help me up, will you?
text: As they go, he hands Valentin an envelope.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Give this to Sofya.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I will.
text: They reach the carriage. Sasha embraces him, kisses him
text: over and over.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Be well. Be well.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Don't cry. I'll send for you when
dialog: I can.
text: They help him up onto the droshky and the carriage starts
text: slowly away from the old house.
scene_heading: 97 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. MORNING 97
text: Out in front of the house, an old peasant woman pulls the
text: feathers off a chicken. Over her impassive face, we hear
text: deep, heavy sobs.
scene_heading: 98 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SITTING ROOM. DAY. 98
text: Sofya is in a rage. Sasha sits nearby.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: I'm simply telling you what
dialog: happened. He's gone. I have no
dialog: idea where. Nobody does.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You're a liar.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Liar!
text: Sasha won't rise to the bait.
text: Valentin comes into the room.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: So, he's gone.
dialog: (to Bulgakov)
dialog: For good.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I think so, yes.
text: There is a pause. Sofya suddenly smiles, becomes
dialog: solicitous.
speaker_heading: SOFY
dialog: Darling Sasha, where is your
dialog: father? I know you know. Please,
dialog: please. Don't play games with me.
dialog: Now it´s not the moment.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Honestly, I have no idea.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
text: DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I have this for you.
text: It is a letter. She grabs it, as if it is something that
text: might feed a terrible hunger at the center of her. Moving
text: into a corner, she tears it open and begins to read.
text: They both watch Sofya's passion. Her face quivers, the
text: muscles in her neck stand out. Her shoulders begin to
dialog: shake.
text: Crumbling the paper in her hand, she twists her head and
text: screams. Then, gathering up her dress, she runs out the
dialog: door.
text: Sasha move immediately to the window. From her P.O.V., we
text: see Sofya streaking across the lawn.
text: They look at each other
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: The pond!
text: They run out.
scene_heading: 99 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY. 99
text: Sofya sprints away from the house and into the trees. A
text: couple of servants join the chase, Ivan and VANYA, a fat
text: manservant. Valentin, head of the group, sees Sofya move
text: out of the birches. She's heading straight to the pond.
dialog: 74.
text: Sasha suddenly steams past him.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Mama, Mama! Stop. Not this.
dialog: Hurry! Hurry!
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Countess!
scene_heading: 100 EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. POND. DAY 100
text: Sofya has reached the bathhouse. Peasant women watch her as
text: they do their wash. She glances back her pursuers, races
dialog: on.
text: Tiring now, she goes to her knees. She crawls along the
text: jetty toward the water. At the edge of the jetty, she
text: falls on her back then turns over, most ungracefully, and
text: rolls off sideways into the pond.
text: HIGH ANGLE. Sofya sinks into the black water. The sound of
text: her rescuers fades away and is replaced by Tolstoy's voice,
text: reading the farewell note she still clutches in her hand.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY (V.O.)
dialog: My position in the house has
dialog: become intolerable. What I'm
dialog: doing now is what people have
dialog: commonly done - leave their
dialog: worldly life behind to spend
dialog: their last days in peace and
dialog: solitude.
text: SLOW MOTION She floats, strangely relaxed, beneath the
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY (V.O.)
dialog: I beg you to forgive me for
dialog: everything I've done to you, just
dialog: as I forgive you with all my soul
dialog: for everything you've done to me.
text: The silence is suddenly ripped apart by the rescuers. Sasha
text: and Valentin jumping into the pond. Sasha, barely able to
text: swim herself, thrashes in the water.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Sasha, go back to the jetty.
dialog: Here, let me help you.
text: He offers his arm, using it to push her to safety.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: No! She's drowning. Help her!
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I will. I will. Stay here.
text: With that, he pushes away from the dock and makes a sharp
text: plunge under the water.
text: Sasha watches, waits...and after a long moment Valentin
text: surfaces pulling Sofya with him.
text: On the dock, the servants and Sasha help him to get her
text: heavy body , water soaked dress, back onto the bank.
text: She looks terrible. Her tongue lolling out, water drizzling
text: from her open mouth. Sasha is overcome.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: She's dead. My mother. She's
dialog: dead.
text: Ivan takes action. He rolls her on to her stomach, works to
text: expel water from her lungs. This goes on for an agonizing
text: length of time. Valentin looks to the sky... dull and gray.
text: Then a sound, coughing sputtering. She is alive. Sasha,
text: Valentin, and the servants help up.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Let me take you to the house,
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Let me die. Please. Why would
dialog: you rob me of that?
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Let's go to the house.
text: Sofya is suddenly clear, almost calm.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Ivan, go to the station. Find out
dialog: which train the master took.
text: Ivan looks at Sasha for approval.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: I see no harm in it. Let's get
dialog: her to bed.
text: Valentin nods. Ivan appears beside him.
speaker_heading: IVAN
text: Life returns to torture her for
dialog: awhile.
text: He laughs out loud,then walks away.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: 101 INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DINING ROOM. DAY. 101
text: Sasha walks into dining room. Valentin pours them tea.
speaker_heading: SASHA
text: She's exhausted herself. She's
dialog: slept for nearly four hours.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm glad she can sleep. The pain
text: subsides a little.
speaker_heading: SASHA
text: The noise subsides a little.
text: They smile at each other.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Well, a little.
text: Ivan comes down the stairs. He stops in the doorway.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Come in.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: A message, miss.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: For me?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: No, for your father. From the
dialog: Countess, miss.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: She's allowed to send a note to
dialog: my father. I just don't know
dialog: where to tell her to send it.
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: She's addressed it to train
dialog: number 9. That's the train the
dialog: master took. The station master
dialog: told me...
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Why are you giving it to me? She
dialog: is allowed to send my father a
dialog: note!
text: Ivan steps forward and hands her the note to inspect. Sasha
text: can't help but laugh.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: She never gives up.
dialog: (reading the note)
dialog: "Dearest papa. Return at once.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: SASHA (cont'd)
dialog: Sasha." She signed it with my
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Ingenious.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Obvious.
text: She pockets the note. Ivan continues to stand there. Sasha
text: looks at him.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: IVAN
dialog: He gave me this as well...the
dialog: stationmaster. A note for you.
text: Sasha opens it, reads. She looks up, flushed with
dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: He's with my aunt. At the
dialog: Shamardino.
text: Sasha runs out of the room.

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm here.
text: She walks to his desk.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You're writing to your girl.
dialog: That's lovely.
text: Sofya touches his shoulder with real affection, then walks

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I don't know if she's my girl.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: But you believe you'll see her

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I very much hope so.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Yes. Refuse to believe in the end
dialog: of love. Do all you can to
dialog: prevent it...
text: Sofya picks up a photograph of the two of them, examines
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: I know you know where he is,
dialog: Valentin.
text: Valentin hesitates. She walks back to him.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: I won't ask you to betray his

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY

speaker_heading: DUSHAN

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY

speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: You're unbearable.

speaker_heading: SOFYA

speaker_heading: CHERTKOV

speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Valentin, will you take me back?
text: Valentin nods.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Yes, of course.
text: Sofya takes his arm, starts back across the platform.

speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: I've behaved badly, haven't I?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: No, Countess, Don't worry. Not at

text: Silence, interrupted only by Tolstoy's incessant hiccups.
text: Valentin notices Dushan is on the verge of tears.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What is it? Dushan, what´s wrong?
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Listen to him. I'm supposed to
dialog: be a doctor, for God's sake.
text: Weak, feverish, Tolstoy sits up in bed. Sasha moves to
dialog: help him.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Sofya!
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: What is it? What is it?
text: Valentin goes to Tolstoy. He's in a kind of panic. Chertkov
text: comes into the room.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: She's come, hasn't she? She`s
dialog: here.
text: He points to the corner. But it is nothing, a gray shape
text: thrown by a coat rack.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: You're imagining things.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: It's true, Leo Nikolayevich.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY

speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: I don't think so...I don't know,

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: To what?

speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: She's at home. I'm sure of it.
text: Valentin looks at the floor.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: At home.
speaker_heading: SASHA

speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Very beautiful isn't it?
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Our home?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Yes.

text: follows.
scene_heading: 135 EXT. ASTAPOVO. STATION MASTER'S HOUSE. DAY 135
text: Valentin sees her leaning against the wall. She's in pain.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: He said to me once..."you're like
dialog: your mother. You're so full of

text: She turns to him.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: I know it's terrible...but who
dialog: will protect him? I don't want

dialog: Valentin.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Kind thoughts from George Bernard
dialog: Shaw.
text: Valentin walks to the table.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: You lied to him.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: Keep your voice down.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: He wants to see her. You heard
dialog: him say it.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: What exactly do you think she
dialog: will bring him?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I don´t know, they´ve been
dialog: married for 48 years.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I´ll tell you what she´ll

speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: She promised me-
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: What? Promised you what? You´ve
text: seen her at close quarters, boy.
dialog: You think she´s capable of
dialog: restraining herself?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: They have a whole life togehter.
dialog: Why do you have to deny that?
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: You're a victim of her romantic
dialog: nonsense. You seem to forget she
dialog: wants to destroy everything we
dialog: do. She travels with that
dialog: unctious little priest.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Keep the priest away-
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: These people are vultures. They
dialog: send in at the last moment and
text: welcome him back to the church.
dialog: That's their fantasy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: A death bed recantation. Do you
dialog: have any idea the damage it would
dialog: do? Everything he's dreamed of,
dialog: everything we've worked for will
dialog: be gone. A simple noble death is
dialog: what we want. It is what he
dialog: wants.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: No, you want an icon. You want to
dialog: take photographs and give out
dialog: postcards..You want people to
text: kneel in front of an image you´ve
dialog: created. But he doesn´t wanted
dialog: that. He never wanted that, and
dialog: it will give him no peace.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He wants to see her...let her
dialog: come.
text: They see Sasha looking from the door. She turns and closes
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I will do everything in my power
dialog: to prevent that.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Oh, God. You exhaust me.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I used to think you were just
dialog: naive, Valentin, maybe a little
dialog: stupid. I see now you're more
dialog: dangerous than she is.
text: He turns back at the door.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Tell me one thing. That image you
dialog: want to create, just looks like
dialog: you, doesn´t it?
text: Valentin leaves the room.
scene_heading: 137 EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. NIGHT. 137
text: The circus sleeps. Valentin sits on a bench outside the

dialog: 93.
text: Some people lie on the hard platform. He looks across the

dialog: window
scene_heading: 138 INT. ASTAPOVO. PRIVATE TRAIN CARRIAGE. NIGHT. 138
text: Sofya keeps her solitary vigil. The priest has fallen

scene_heading: 139 EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM.NIGHT 139

scene_heading: 141 INT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT. 141
text: Valentin sees Chertkov standing near the bed. Dushan
text: returns to the chair next to Tolstoy. His cheeks are damp,
text: his breathing irregular.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: It can't be right. His fever is
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: His pulse, you see...
text: Dushan begins to cry. Suddenly, Tolstoy becomes lucid.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Sofya...my dear Sofya. So much
text: has (hic) fallen to her.
text: Everyone moves nearer the bed. Tolstoy looks at Valentin.
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Who's going to look after her?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Someone needs to look after her.
text: There is a long pause. Sasha looks at Valentin.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Shall I call her?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: This is it(hic). The end.
dialog: 94.
text: He seems to smile.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Do you want to see her, papa?
speaker_heading: TOLSTOY
dialog: Sasha, Sasha..
dialog: It's(hic)nothing...Nothing.
text: He falls onto his pillow, asleep.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
text: It's almost over.
text: Sasha looks at him, shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: I can't do this anymore.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: He won´t know who she is anyway.
scene_heading: 142 INT. ASTAPOVO. TRAIN CARRIAGE. NIGHT. 142
text: Everyone sleeps but Sofya. There is a knock on the door.

speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Has he asked for me?
speaker_heading: SASHA

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Countess...Countess...Do you have
dialog: any information? Countess...Is he
dialog: dying? Is he dead?
text: Sasha takes her mother's hand.
scene_heading: 144 INT. ASTAPOVO. STATIONMASTER'S HOUSE. NIGHT. 144
text: She steps into the room. For a moment, she seems
text: overwhelmed at the sight of him. She looks at Valentin, who
text: nods at her as if to say go on. Sofya walks past Chertkov
text: without acknowledging him. Dushan lets go his hold of
text: Tolstoy's wrist and gets out of the chair, out of her way.
text: She approaches her sleeping, husband, the love of her life,
dialog: her cross, her everything.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Lyovochka!
text: There is no response. She throws her arms around him.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Please forgive me, my darling!
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Mother...
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: I'm a fool.. I'm a selfish woman.
dialog: But I love you. Please believe
dialog: me. Please understand me. Please
dialog: forgive me for all my weakness
dialog: and badness. Please! Please! Love
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Mother!
text: Sasha takes her hand, whispers.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Control yourself.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Was I shouting?
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: You have to control yourself.
text: Sofya looks around and sits back. Strangely, she does
text: control herself. She becomes very still. She takes her
text: husband's hand, begins quietly to speak to him.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: You don't speak, but I hear you.
text: She carries on two sides of an impossible conversation.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: "Do you love me, Lyovochka."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: "Never stopped, my little bird."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: "And you will never stop"

dialog: (beat)
dialog: "Never, ever again.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: "Good...good... let's go home"
dialog: 96.
text: She sits very still holding her husband's hand. Then, it
text: seems she feels the slightest of movements, the slightest
text: squeeze of her hand. She looks down to see Tolstoy open his
text: eyes. He looks at her for a moment, the hint of a smile,
text: then closes his eyes again.
text: Valentin sees it, glances at Sasha. Then, he begins to
dialog: fight for breath.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: First cessation.
text: A general sense of panic at the proximity of death. Tolstoy
text: fights for a last breath.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Second cessation.
text: Sofya whispers quietly to her dying husband.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Please forgive me if I cry a
dialog: little now.
text: Tolstoy continues to struggle, then silence, silence.
text: Sasha starts to sob. Sofya reaches out to her daughter.
text: Sasha comes to her mother who holds her.
text: She feels someone next to her. She looks up. It's
dialog: Chertkov.
speaker_heading: CHERTKOV
dialog: I am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna.
text: The most unlikely thing, she pats his hand.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: It's alright. What happens from
dialog: now on... it will never really
dialog: matter. Not really. Everything's
dialog: finished.
text: Chertkov sits beside them. She turns to Dushan.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Dushan, could you tell them your
dialog: great friend is gone?
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: Yes.
text: He nods, walk out into the dawn light to tell the world Leo
text: Tolstoy is dead.

text: Dushan faces the crowd. Quiet. Quiet.
speaker_heading: DUSHAN
dialog: At ten minutes after six in the
dialog: morning, a great soul passed from
dialog: our world. Leo Nikoleyevich
text: Tolstoy is dead.
text: As Dushan finishes his tribute, a single voice begins to
text: sing the old Russian hymn, Eternal Memory. Gradually, more
text: and more of the crowd picks it up. Valentin begins to sing.
text: His eyes run over the crowd of mourners. Then, something
text: stops the flow of his gaze. His eyes fill with tears.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Masha...
text: Masha. She walks slowly toward him out of the crowd. He
text: goes to her, takes her in a long embrace.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Masha...Masha...I'm so sorry he's
text: gone. He´s gone.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Yes. Yes. I know, but I came for
dialog: you, Valya. I came for you, too.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I love you. I do. I love you.
speaker_heading: MASHA
dialog: Then, hold me. Hold me. Hold me.
text: The song, the voices swell around them. They hold each
dialog: other like they will never let go.
scene_heading: 146 EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY. 146
text: A black draped funeral train waits in the station. Many
text: mourners are congregated on the platform. Chertkov comes
text: out of the little house, followed by Andrey, Valentin and
text: Dushan carrying Tolstoy's coffin to the train.
text: Sofya appears with Sasha, who escorts her through the

speaker_heading: ORTHODOX PRIEST
dialog: As a daughter of the church, I'm
dialog: sure you wouldn't object to my

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Countess...Countess.
text: She looks out. Below the train window, Valentin and Masha

speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Well, I'm ready to go now.

dialog: Why aren´t we moving? Can't
dialog: someone make it move?
text: But at that moment, the train begins to move.
speaker_heading: SOFYA
dialog: Oh!
scene_heading: 150 EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY. 150
text: Sofya looks out the window, sees the people lined up along

text: Valentin watches the train pull away. He holds Masha to
dialog: him.
text: As the train moves slowly through the corridor of mourners,
