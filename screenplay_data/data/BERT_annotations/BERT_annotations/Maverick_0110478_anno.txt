text: We are in a Sergio Leone TIGHT CLOSEUP of just a hideouslooking man. One eye looks straight ahead. The other
dialog: wanders.
scene_heading: CAMERA MOVES AGAIN.
text: The wind is really kicking up --- suddenly, another STOP.
text: Another Leone CLOSEUP.
text: A second man. This guy makes the first one look

text: But his neck has been horribly burned as if from a noose.

dialog: Whether that's because of his considerable physical
dialog: skills or his sunny personality, who knows. It might
dialog: be his quiet wit.
dialog: In any case, we are looking at a handsome young man that
dialog: everybody likes --- oops --- make that almost everybody.
text: Because just now he is seated on a horse beneath a tree
text: and a thick hope has been tied around his neck, the rope
text: thrown over a branch. His hands have been tied behind
text: his back. We are about to watch a hanging. His.
speaker_heading: THE ANGEL
dialog: (riding closer)
dialog: I almost got hung myself once,
dialog: didn't much care for it, how about
dialog: you?
dialog: (as Maverick
dialog: says nothing)
dialog: We're gonna leave now, but I'm
dialog: worried about your well-being.
text: Maverick just stares at him, makes no reply.
speaker_heading: THE ANGEL
text: He gestures for the other two to ride, and they take
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: THE ANGEL
dialog: See, I don't think it's a good
dialog: thing for a man to be alone out
dialog: here. Your mind can do cruel
dialog: things.
text: And now he takes a burlap sack, tosses it toward
text: Maverick. It lands nearby.

text: The place is busy enough, the bar doing a brisk business.
text: A poker game is in session. Half a dozen play. A
text: cattlehand, a preacher, a small-time local businessman.
dialog: But it's the other three we pay most attention to.
text: First is a very young man. Late teens, looks less.
text: Thin. Small. A hundred and thirty pounds after a big
dialog: meal. This is THE KID. Seems ordinary.
text: Next to him sits, of all things, a woman. But not
dialog: ordinary, certainly not in these surroundings. She's
text: elegantly-dressed, close to being beautiful. She's
dialog: married, has a deep Southern accent, and hasn't been
text: poor for a long time. Maybe she's thirty. She seems
dialog: a rotten poker player, but a wonderful flirt. This
text: is ANNABELLE BRANSFORD.
dialog: Next to her sits The Angel. We met him already -- he
text: tossed the burlap bag of rattlesnakes at Maverick just
text: before the hanging. Huge, powerful, not much makes him
dialog: smile, except winning at cards.
text: There is an empty seat at the table.
speaker_heading: STAIRCASE
text: as Maverick descends. If before he was grimy from

speaker_heading: THE ANGEL
dialog: I like the game the way it is.
speaker_heading: MAVERICK
dialog: I bring all kinds of plusses to
dialog: the table. I hardly ever bluff and
dialog: I never ever cheat.
speaker_heading: THE ANGEL
dialog: I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: MAVERICK
dialog: Neither do I.
speaker_heading: THE ANGEL
dialog: (voice rising, not
dialog: in pitch, but
dialog: intensity)
dialog: I like the game just the way it
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: MAVERICK
dialog: Bet I can change your mind.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I promise to lose for at least
dialog: an hour.
speaker_heading: THE ANGEL

dialog: -- but so does Maverick.
speaker_heading: MAVERICK
text: losing again, this time to Annabelle.

text: Of the cattleman casually making a bet.

text: Of Maverick, who doesn't seem to be paying much
dialog: attention.
text: He loses again, smiles.
text: Now the preacher is staring at his cards before betting.
text: For a long beat.
text: And the cattleman is fiddling with his chips.
text: The chips in front of The Angel are sloppy.
text: The chips in front of Annabelle are neatly stacked. She
text: flicks her fingernails against her front teeth, makes a
dialog: bet.
text: The businessman is toying with his necktie.
text: The Angel is holding his cards, moving the top to the
text: bottom, then repeating, the top to the bottom.
text: And Maverick loses again, smiles again, just happy to
dialog: be there.
text: Annabelle is suddenly helpless, giggling, staring at
dialog: what she's been dealt.
text: The Angel is smiling happily.
text: He rakes in a pot.
text: The businessman's fingers are tapping on the table.
text: The Kid's hand covers his mouth.
text: The Angel is bored, looking neither at the other players
dialog: or the pot.
dialog: Annabelle bets big and wins -- maybe she's not such a
dialog: rotten poker player after all.

dialog: (mumbling something)
dialog: Don't think...

speaker_heading: THE ANGEL
dialog: You always been gutless?
speaker_heading: MAVERICK
dialog: (thinks a minute -then nods)
dialog: I think so. At least for as long
dialog: as I can remember. My pappy
dialog: always said, 'He who fights and
text: runs away, can run away another
dialog: day.'
dialog: (now he stands -like every other
dialog: man in the room, he
dialog: wears a six gun)
dialog: Here's the truth -- I don't see

dialog: Answer? Zero.
