scene_heading: EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: A gaping hole in the concrete side of a freeway. On the
text: embankment beside the hole BRENDAN FRYE squats, shoulders
text: hunched. His dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the
text: shallow stream of water which flows into the tunnel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE WATER
dialog: 
text: not more than six inches deep. Just beneath the surface a
text: young woman's pale blue arm in gaudy bracelets bats against

scene_heading: INT. LOCKER CAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: A single locker. That same arm, bracelets and all, slips a
text: note through the slats, then leaves quickly.
dialog: 
text: As the cage empties a lone figure slumps to the locker.
text: Opens it. The note falls to his feet.
dialog: 
text: The figure is Brendan. He unfolds the note (folded in a
text: triangle) -- "12:30 PICO &amp; ALEXANDER".

dialog: 
scene_heading: A WRIST WATCH
text: 12:43. Brendan looks up from the watch.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
dialog: 
text: He sits on the curb of a wide suburban street, eats lunch
text: from a brown bag and watches a phone booth on the corner. He
text: shows no surprise when it begins to ring. Brendan goes to
text: the phone and puts the receiver to his ear. Silence for a
text: moment, then a thin female voice from the phone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 1
text: Originally Dode was later revealed to have been hiding above the tunnel.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (slow, deliberate)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: That's good.
dialog: 
text: Her voice thins to a high, strained breath. She is crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What's going on, Em?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (through strained crying)
dialog: It's good to see you, Brendan.

speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: It's been some time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Two months.

speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Screwed up how?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: (blubbering, fast and

dialog: I did what she said with the brick, I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Slow down now, what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You gotta help me Brendan I think tug-
dialog: Oh!
dialog: 
text: With a sharp breath the line clicks dead just as a black
text: mustang roars by. Brendan drops the receiver and spins out
text: of the booth.
dialog: 
text: There, another pay phone up the hill -- empty.
dialog: 
text: Brendan turns to the black mustang, far down the street. A
text: man's hand drops a cigarette butt from the driver side
dialog: window.1
dialog: 
text: The mustang turns the corner, gone.
dialog: 
text: Brendan walks after it, finds the cigarette butt on the
text: street. Still smoking.
text: A pale blue arrow is printed on the filter.
dialog: 
text: In the distance the class bell rings.

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The high school is open air - the hallways are alleyways
text: between buildings. A short kid with eyeglasses the size of
dialog: 
dialog: 1
dialog: Because of the orientation of the street, this was all flipped when we shot it, and the
text: hand came from the passenger window. The dialogue in the ending field scene was
text: changed to match, causing mass confusion for about half an hour on set.

dialog: been eating?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: Back of school.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Huh. Yeah, no one's seen you. What's it
dialog: been, a couple months?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah, it's been awhile. You gave Emily
dialog: my locker number?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: A few days ago. Was I wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: To give it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: It's been so long, I don't know you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: It has been awhile. Who's she been

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: I dunno. It's hard to keep track.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: She hasn't been doing too good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah well. I'm not looking for a patch
dialog: up. Em's life is her own. But she
dialog: asked for my help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Help with what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I don't know. I don't even care, it's
dialog: not my business. I just want to know
dialog: she's ok, so I've got to find her.
dialog: That's all this is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Well. I know she was poking in with the
text: Ivy-bound cheerleading elite. Laura
text: Dannon's crowd.
dialog: 
text: Across the parking lot a beautiful girl with dark long hair
text: kisses an football player.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Laura Dannon there with the Rabbit?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Yeah. Brad Bramish with her. Cream on
text: the upper crust.
dialog: 
text: Brad laughs heartily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: He's a sap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Know him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: By sight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: I won't argue then. Anyway Em tagged
dialog: after them for a bit, but it didn't
dialog: work. So she picked her way down the
dialog: food chain. Last I seen she was with
dialog: whasshername, that drama vamp. Small
dialog: time dealer, augh, the evil one, the one
dialog: you dated-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Kara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: That's my bus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You know her locker number?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Kara's?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Em's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: 239.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Thanks Brain. Keep your specs on, find
dialog: me if she shows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: The Brain trots off. In the distance Brad and Laura laugh,
text: and he kisses her. Her hair blows in the wind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOCKER CAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Empty. Locker 239 is open, its door swinging gently in the
dialog: wind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF GYM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brendan sits against the massive building, flipping through
text: loose papers. He finds two photographs, one of Emily hugging
text: him, the other of Emily with a beautiful sharp-eyed girl at
text: a party, drinks in hand.
dialog: 
text: Sorting more papers, he finds a red card with a sequined
text: mask on the front. The bottom edge has been torn off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Sixth period has broke. Masses of students pile into busses.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL THEATER - DAY
dialog: 
text: A huge chunk of brown building. Brendan strides towards it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL THEATER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Drama people sit on the floor facing the stage. Brendan
text: steps behind one, the sharp-eyed girl from the picture. She
text: holds a freshman boy's head in her lap. Pets it like a dog.
dialog: 
text: She looks back at Brendan, her face in shadow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (through a mocking smile)
dialog: Hello, Brendan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Kara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: Come to see the show?
text: Kisses the freshman's forehead, purring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No, I didn't.
text: (nudges the freshman with his
dialog: toe)
dialog: Lapdog, blow.
dialog: 
text: The freshman sits up, looks to Kara like a spooked puppy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: (to the lapdog)
dialog: Stay.
dialog: (to Brendan)
dialog: Don't be mean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I'm all friendly.
dialog: (to the lapdog)
dialog: Watch your head, kid - that thing bites.
dialog: 
text: The dog pops up again. Kara pulls him down and nuzzles his
dialog: ear.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: I need words.

speaker_heading: KARA

dialog: Get me my purse.
dialog: (he goes)
dialog: Hurry!
dialog: 
text: He breaks into a trot. Kara smiles at Brendan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Still picking your teeth with freshmen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: You were a freshman once.
dialog: 
text: She slides her fingers up his arm. He growls and pushes them
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Way once, sister. You and Em were tight
dialog: for a bit. Who's she eating with now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: Eating with?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: Eating with. Lunch. Who.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: You're a cutie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You gonna tell me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: Guess you're up from the underneath
dialog: then. The whole Jerr thing blown over.
dialog: Lucky strikes, you and your partner get
dialog: bulled, you come up clean. But I guess
dialog: you were always the brains of the
dialog: outfit.1
dialog: 
dialog: 1
text: One of many instances of an allusion to the Jerr backstory, most of which were
text: trimmed back in the editing process for clarity. The author has threatened to write it as
text: a stand alone short story, but probably never will, so in a nutshell: when Brendan and
text: Emily were still an item she started hanging out with Jerr, a small time dealer. Brendan
text: didn't approve, so he partnered up with Jerr then ratted him out to Trueman. Emily
text: found out, and that led to their breakup on the field, which we see in a flashback.
dialog: 
dialog: 9
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Where's Emily?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: Sometimes I wonder why I dumped you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (standing to go)
dialog: God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: I don't know where she's at, Brendan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I know you do, so why don't you want me
dialog: to find her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: Maybe I'm looking out for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (going)
dialog: Well I appreciate that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: Brendan... you looking to get back into
dialog: things? I could use you.
dialog: 
text: He is gone. Behind Kara, the play goes on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The play is seen in shadow-play through the backdrop.
dialog: 
text: Brendan slips in through an exit door, crosses the backstage
text: area and enters the dressing rooms.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Cramped and empty. Pictures of Kara with friends are stuck
text: in the mirror. Brendan roughly searches drawers, bags,
text: pockets... nothing. He stops. A red edge behind one of the
text: photos - the same red card with a mask on it, but whole.
text: Across the bottom in small print: "Halloween in January -
scene_heading: Call for DETAILS - 555-2394"

speaker_heading: LAURA'S VOICE

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: LAURA'S VOICE
dialog: For what?

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Details about the party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA'S VOICE
dialog: Who is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I don't think we've met.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA'S VOICE
dialog: Well then I don't think you're invited
dialog: to my party. It's a rather exclusive
dialog: gathering.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I can imagine.
text: (she starts to speak, he cuts
dialog: her off)
dialog: You should really work on your invite
dialog: management. That might be a personal
dialog: 'room for improvement' area in your
dialog: life. But discretion of your invite
dialog: sending aside, I have procured a certain
dialog: someone's invitation, and would like
dialog: details.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA'S VOICE
dialog: Who are you? Or I'll hang up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You don't know me - I'll save you some

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA'S VOICE
dialog: I know everyone and I've got all the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Folly of youth. Ask whose invitation

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA'S VOICE

speaker_heading: LAURA'S VOICE
text: 15 Bush street, up in Stockton Cove.
text: Buzz 42 at the gate. Nine o'clock. But

dialog:

dialog: 12
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STOCKTON COVE GATE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: An imposing private community gate. Brendan coasts up on his

scene_heading: directory: "42 -- DANNON"
dialog: 
text: Using the call box as a hand hold he hops the gate and walks
text: briskly up the street.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STOCKTON COVE STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Shiny cars line the curb. Party noises come from an upscale
text: two story house. Brendan takes a short breath, then strides
text: up to the front door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Large and clean, with a two story ceiling and a railed
text: staircase at one end. Fifteen or twenty clean people, some
text: in costumes, mill about in cliques. Brendan comes in as if
text: he doesn't mind who sees him coming in. He gets a couple odd
text: stares, but no one stops him.
dialog: 
text: With non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd to
text: the beer keg in back and draws half a cup.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARLOUR - SAME
dialog: 
text: Richly adorned, crowded, lit with bright pools of light.
text: Brendan drifts in and stands in the back, deep in shadow.
dialog: 
text: The music comes from a baby grand piano set against one
text: wall. Laura Dannon leans against it. She wears a red
text: kimono, and is striking against the velvet black piano.
text: Laura's kid sister, 11 years old with glasses, sits at the
text: piano playing "All I do is Dream of You".
dialog: 
text: Laura sings, lovely and soft but with strength.1
dialog: 
text: Brendan watches from the back, his face obscured in shadow,
text: but his eyes gleam. Through the darkened window behind him
text: a match flares up, and someone standing outside lights a
dialog: cigarette.
dialog: 
text: Laura finishes the song. The room applauds, and she ruffles
text: her kid sister's hair.
dialog: 
text: Brendan ducks out, and into
dialog: 
dialog: 1
dialog: By the time we got around to production this had changed to "Someone to Watch Over

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME
dialog: 
text: Brad Bramish, the jock who was kissing Laura in the parking

dialog: elbow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: If the coach wants to play me I'll play,
dialog: but I can't put my best game in if I've
dialog: got to worry about whether I'm going to
dialog: be in there. Halftime last game, coach
dialog: is pissed I ran it on a pass play, out
dialog: on the field he says to me 'you gotta
dialog: think about the team and you gotta' you
dialog: know and 'if you run that ball again
dialog: you're out', and I said to him you gotta
dialog: let me play! I'm out there, let me play,
dialog: and he's saying 'no you're out' and I
dialog: kept saying 'Let me play! Let me play!
dialog: Let me play!', just right in his face-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: He was!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Just 'Let me play! Let me play! Let me
dialog: play!' 'No you gotta' 'No, let me play!
dialog: Let me play! Let me play!'
dialog: 
text: Brad hunches forward, his face swollen purple, yelling that
text: over and over. Tom steps in front of Brendan, blocking his
text: line of sight.
dialog: 
text: Brendan scans the rest of the room. His eyes catch on Laura,
text: leaning against a divan. Her bright, sharp eyes cut through
text: the room, straight into Brendan.
text: He wags his eyebrows at her.
dialog: 
text: She looks away quickly. Brendan turns back to Brad, still
text: shouting 'let me play'. Tom stands between them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Tom!
dialog: 
text: Brad falls silent. Most of the room follows suit. Tom turns
text: around. Brendan smiles good naturedly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: Could you step aside, please? I'm
text: trying to follow Brad's story, and it's
text: difficult when I can't see his face.
dialog: 
dialog: 14
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The room watches Brendan. Tom mumbles something and steps
text: aside. Brad stares at Brendan stupidly. Brendan flashes a
text: dopey grin and tips his glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (stumbles)
dialog: He doesn't give me a play to make, what
dialog: can I do, you know?
dialog: 
text: He falls into awkward silence. Biff starts babbling.
dialog: 
text: Brendan looks at Brad, who is staring back at him.
dialog: 
text: Brendan then slowly drags his gaze over to Laura, staring at
text: him too, her eyes slightly amused. Brendan cocks an eyebrow.
text: The slightest hint of a smile takes the corner of her mouth,
text: and she wags her eyebrows once at him.
dialog: 
text: Brendan glances back at Brad, looking at Laura now, not
text: amused at all.
dialog: 
text: Brendan stands to go. Biff chatters on. Brad cuts him off.

speaker_heading: BRAD (cont'd)
dialog: Hey. Hey! What are you doing here?

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Leaving.

speaker_heading: BRAD

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Brad's not a good guy to get on the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Fearless flyer. Quit your yappin and fix

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

dialog: Well like you said, I've got to work on
dialog: that. Em's been AWOL for a good month,
dialog: nobody's seen her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I saw her yesterday.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Nearly nobody's seen her. So what did
dialog: she tell you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (winces)
dialog: Score 0 for finesse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Listen, you're scratching at the wrong
dialog: door. I wasn't with Emily enough to know
dialog: details of what she was in, I just got
dialog: wind of the downfall, and I didn't get
dialog: any details of that, except that it was
dialog: bad. So now that we're showing some
dialog: cards...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: If you haven't got a finger in Em's
dialog: troubles, why'd her name get me into
dialog: your rather exclusive party?
dialog: 
dialog: 17
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Keep up with me now. I don't know, but
dialog: it sounded like you did, and a body's
dialog: got a right to be curious. Now I'm not
dialog: so sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Well I'll put that body to bed. I don't
dialog: know a damn thing about whatever
dialog: troubles, and that works for me. I just
dialog: want to find her.
dialog: 
text: A long beat. Laura studies Brendan's face, then seems to
dialog: come to a decision.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Coffee and pie.
dialog: 
text: The words hang in the air a moment. A look of recognition
dialog: from Brendan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Coffee and pie oh my?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: And you didn't hear it from me.
dialog: 
text: He sips his drink. A voice calls from the glass door.
text: Another girl. Laura flashes Brendan a look and goes to her.
text: They have quick, quiet words and the girl leaves. Laura
text: turns back to Brendan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: Will you wait here for me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You'll stay right here and wait -- I'll
dialog: be five minutes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: The moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops
text: the fence, into the neighbor's yard.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Brendan runs to the edge of the neighboring house and peeks
text: around. Laura comes out the front door, cuts across the
text: lawn and sidewalk and trots out into the street. Brendan
dialog: 
dialog: 18
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: begins to follow, but a noise from behind the fence stops
text: him - a match being struck.
dialog: 
text: Brendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a
text: splintered hole.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BRENDAN'S POV - THROUGH THE FENCE
dialog: 
text: A brightly lit window in the side of Brad's house, and
text: through the window the party.
dialog: 
text: A dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat, all
text: inky black. The figure smokes a cigarette and watches the
text: party, absently stroking his cheek.
dialog: 
text: Brendan steps back - SNAP! A twig.
dialog: 
text: The figure freezes. Then, making no noise at all, it spins
text: to face Brendan, a towering black form against the window.
dialog: 
text: The glowing cigarette falls to the grass.
text: A metallic glint, and a clicking sound not unlike a gun.
dialog: 
text: Brendan throws himself backwards onto the grass. A beat.
dialog: 
text: Through the hole the black of the figure's cloak whips away.
dialog: 
text: Brendan hesitates, then hops the fence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF BRAD'S HOUSE - SAME
dialog: 
text: Brendan lands on his feet. No black figure to be found.
dialog: 
text: The cigarette still smolders on the ground. Hand rolled,
dialog: plain paper.
dialog: 
text: Brendan gazes through the window, catching his breath. Then
text: he breaks the trance and creeps towards the street.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Peeking around the house, Brendan sees Laura cut across the
text: lawn and trot into the street. Using parked cars as cover,
text: Brendan follows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
dialog: 
text: Between cars, Brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and
text: engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a
text: black Mustang. Laura goes to him and speaks quickly.
dialog: 
dialog: 19
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows. Laura
text: says something to him. Grunting something angrily, he gets
text: in the car with the bald kid and peels off.
dialog: 
text: Laura turns and slowly walks towards the house.
dialog: 
text: When she is gone Brendan stands, throws a look back at the
text: house and walks off down the street, towards the guard gate.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK PATIO
dialog: 
text: The two drinks, where Brendan left them. Laura takes hers
text: and drains it. The suburban lights twinkle like stars.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CARROWS PARKING LOT - DAY
dialog: 
text: The sun rises over Carrows family restaurant, a squat
text: structure backed against the weedy edge of the runoff tunnel
text: ravine.
dialog: 
text: A banner from 1973 in the window - "Coffee and Pie oh my!"
text: A pack of six pale stoners slump against the rear dumpster.
text: Their beady eyes follow Brendan in sync as he approaches.
dialog: 
text: He goes to the nearest one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Where's Dode?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STONER 1
dialog: Dunno, bra.
dialog: 
text: Silence and blank stares. Brendan calmly moves to the next
dialog: stoner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Dode?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STONER 2
dialog: Uh uh.
dialog: 
text: Brendan moves to the next one.
dialog: 
text: A thin head pokes from around the dumpster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: Hey Brendan. Maybe you shouldn't be
dialog: here.
dialog: 
text: Brendan steps around the dumpster. Dode slumps against the
text: wall, thin and delicate in dusty black. Slivery eyes, pale
text: lips, muffled intelligence.
dialog: 
dialog: 20
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Kara told me you know where Em's at.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: Uh huh. And why are you looking for Em?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: She asked for my help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: Uh huh. Listen man, I've got plenty on
dialog: my plate without dealing with some
dialog: jilted ex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: It's not about that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: Whatever it's about, act smarter than
dialog: you look and drop it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Where is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: She's with me, and right now that's the
dialog: best place for her. Leave the low life
text: to the low lifers and dangle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You're on the bright side of dim, Dode,
dialog: but if I thought you had this half-
dialog: handled I'd be eating lunch. Where's
dialog: she at?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: Better get while it's good.
dialog: 
text: Brendan doesn't.
speaker_heading: DODE (cont'd)
dialog: Heel it now, dig?
dialog: 
text: The 5 big stoners appear behind Brendan, threatening. Dode
text: turns his head away to light a joint.
dialog: 
text: Brendan's fist slams into his face, sending the joint
text: spinning. Brendan slams Dode's frail frame against the
text: dumpster.
dialog: 
text: The 5 stoners stand in the exact same position, deer in the
text: headlights. One makes a half hearted motion to intervene.
dialog: 
dialog: 21
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIG STONER
dialog: Back off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Throw one at me if you want, hash head.
dialog: I've got all five senses and I slept
dialog: last night, that puts me six up on the
dialog: lot of you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIG STONER
dialog: Just easy-
dialog: 
text: Brendan slams Dode into the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (to Dode)
dialog: Where's Em?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: (deliberate)
dialog: She's with me. She was tight when she
dialog: called you, man. Came to and freaked.
dialog: She told me to shake you if you came by.
dialog: Said you'd only make things worse.
dialog: 
text: Brendan covers how shaken he is by this statement fairly
text: well. He drops Dode.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STONER 1 (O.S.)
dialog: Put him down, man!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: Deal with whatever this ain't about and
dialog: drop it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIG STONER
dialog: (to Brendan)
dialog: Nothing more here, bra.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Tell Emily I want to see her. Tell her
dialog: if she still wants my help or not that's
dialog: her business, but I want to hear it
text: straight from her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: She don't -
dialog: 
text: Brendan walks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Today. She knows where I eat lunch.
dialog: 
dialog: 22
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: When Brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner
text: shouts with conviction
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIG STONER
dialog: And stay out, punk!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Brendan hides behind a tall clump of bushes.
dialog: 
text: A moment later Dode hustles away from Carrows. Brendan
text: follows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: The sun is rising as Brendan tails Dode through the twisty
text: suburban streets.
dialog: 
text: Brendan takes cover as Dode stops by a white hatchback.
dialog: 
text: A girl gets out of the car and embraces Dode. Her wrist is
text: adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead
text: girl's arm. Dode speaks quickly to her, she nods and speaks
text: back. He hands her a slip of paper, which she tucks into a
text: brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket
text: pocket. They embrace again, Dode walks off and the girl gets
text: in her car.
dialog: 
text: Brendan stumbles after the car, but it is quickly gone. He
text: watches it go, then follows Dode back towards school.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL THEATER - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Dode slumps into the front door of the brown building.
text: Brendan watches him from a distance, eyes thoughtful. After
text: a beat he turns and walks off into the thickening crowds of
dialog: students.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE UP
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF SCHOOL - MIDDAY
dialog: 
text: Brendan eats lunch alone on a concrete wall beside a long,
text: empty utility road behind the school.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LATER
dialog: 
text: Reclining on the wall, reading "Lord of the Flies". He
text: raises his eyes, and sits up suddenly.
dialog: 
dialog: 23
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Off in the distance on the utility road a tiny figure
text: approaches, stumbling. Brendan jumps and hits the ground
text: running towards the figure.
dialog: 
dialog: Meet the girl with cheap bracelets, the girl Dode spoke to,
text: the dead girl, Emily. He catches her just as she stumbles
text: and falls and carries her into the shade of a covered
dialog: hallway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Emily and Brendan sit in silence. She is very pretty, but
text: she looks bad. Too much makeup, not enough sleep. She
text: sniffles, speaks to her shoes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I must have sounded pretty crazy on the
dialog: phone. Yesterday.
dialog: 
text: She taps her shoes together lightly, eyes fixed on them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY (cont'd)
dialog: It was dumb, I got paranoid over a
dialog: really stupid thing. I was high, I went
dialog: crazy for a little bit, but now you have
dialog: to forget about it. Please. That's how
dialog: you can help me now, forget about it.
dialog: 
text: She turns her weak eyes to Brendan for the first time. His
text: stare is unwavering, searching. She pushes on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY (cont'd)
dialog: Brendan, I know you're mad at all these
dialog: people, cause you think I went away from
dialog: you and went to them. But you've got to
dialog: start seeing it as my decision, stop
dialog: being angry because where I want to be
dialog: at's different from where you wanna be
dialog: at.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Who fed you that line, Em?
dialog: 
text: She looks back at her shoes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: And stop picking on Dode. He's a good
dialog: guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: The Carrows rat?
dialog: 
dialog: 24
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: He's a good friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: So what am I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (strained anger)
dialog: Yeah, what are you? Eating back here,
dialog: not liking anybody, how are you judging
dialog: anyone? I loved you alot but I couldn't
dialog: stand it, I had to get with people. I
dialog: couldn't heckle life with you, I had to
dialog: see what was what.
dialog: 
text: A beat. She taps her clogs. One has a hole worn through the
text: sole. Her face contorts, seizes up, and she is sobbing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY (cont'd)
dialog: I'm sorry Brendan.
dialog: 
text: She buries her face in his shoulder. He has a hard time
dialog: speaking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You've got to come back to me, Em.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No. No. Never. I'm sorry. Never. I can't
dialog: love on your terms, Brendan. I can't do
dialog: that, I'm not like you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You're in a spot, I can get you out of
dialog: it. Come back to me, and whatever heat
dialog: follows you I'll deal with.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No. You're not hearing me, no. I don't
dialog: want to be put away and protected. No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY (cont'd)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Tell me about the trouble, the brick and
dialog: the pin -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You gonna fix things like you did with
dialog: Jerr? No. I came to say goodbye, for
dialog: good. Whatever you have to do to let me
dialog: go, do it. I'm gonna let you go, I've
dialog: 
dialog: 25
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: decided that. Make sure that, you've got
dialog: to, promise you won't torture yourself,
dialog: that you'll let me go.
dialog: 
text: She embraces him, enveloping him in her jacket. His face is
text: a frozen mask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY (cont'd)
dialog: Let me go.
dialog: 
text: As she pulls away he mechanically slips an address book from
text: her jacket pocket.
dialog: 
text: He watches her as she walks away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM
dialog: 
text: Brendan sits in the back, flipping through the address book.
text: The teacher drones on about the significance of the pig's
dialog: head in "Lord of the Flies".1
scene_heading: THE ADDRESS BOOK
dialog: 
text: Illegible scribbles, names, numbers, nothing that stops his
text: search - then the note Dode gave her, a corner of loose-leaf
dialog: paper which looks like this:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brendan studies the paper intently.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Brain studies the paper. Busses pull into the parking
text: lot behind them. Brendan is distant, lost in thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Hm. Do you know anything else about
dialog: this?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 1
text: Our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to Brendan's lunch spot to save us
text: a location change. The degree to which the lack of classroom time in the film has been
dialog: commented on has always bemused the author, who cannot for the life of him
dialog: remember a single interesting thing that happened in a classroom in high school.
dialog: 
dialog: 26
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Mm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Slim pickings. Why'd you let Dode fly
dialog: when he came back to whose-her-name, at
dialog: the theater?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (shrugs dismissively)
dialog: Kara. It's their turf, I couldn't hear
dialog: them without being seen, and that would
dialog: only biff their play. Best to know it's
dialog: there, let it ride and see what comes of
dialog: it.
dialog: (touches the paper)
dialog: But anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Hm. Well, if this is what I think it is,
dialog: it didn't come straight from Dode, less
text: he's playing out of his league.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I can only give you my best guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: When the upper crust does shady deeds
dialog: they do them in different spots around
dialog: town. I know under the pier's one, down
text: by the bike trails in the state park's
dialog: another. There's alot of them. The pitch
dialog: is they've got little symbols for each
dialog: one, and that's how they tell each other
dialog: the place, so word won't get around. So
dialog: this might be that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: But Dode wouldn't know it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
text: This is upper crust. Dode's pie pan
dialog: grease.
dialog: 
text: Brendan studies the symbol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Call anything up?
dialog: 
dialog: 27
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: How many places start with 'A'? Or if
text: it's a shape, or just a random symbol.
dialog: Anyway, even if you figured it out, what
dialog: good could you do? She's smart, she
text: knows the play, she's gunning to square
dialog: things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: You said her business was none of yours,
dialog: so she's alright, forget it now. Go
dialog: home, sleep.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BRENDAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sparsely furnished. Brendan plays Tetris on his computer,
text: staring off into space. His mom's voice calls "Good night"
text: and the hallway light turns off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LATER
dialog: 
text: 10:30 by the clock radio on Brendan's nightstand. The slip
text: of paper rests beside it. Brendan lies in bed, staring at
text: the symbol on the paper. His eyes tense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE SYMBOL
dialog: 
text: Growing larger, burning with a searing intensity, then
text: folding into darkness. Water rushes overhead, over concrete,
text: concrete with a hole in it -- the runoff tunnel, just for an
text: instant, then back underwater, screaming. Brendan choking,
text: screaming, plunging upwards. A woman with no face falls from
text: the darkness and kisses him, her long hair sweeping around
text: him then pulling away. As the last strands slide off his
text: face he wakes up with a start.
dialog: 
text: The clock says 3:46. Brendan drips with sweat, breathing
text: raggedly. He takes the paper and a pencil from the
text: nightstand and shades the symbol to look like this:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: FLASH CUT - The runoff tunnel, lining up perfectly with the
text: now shaded symbol.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BACK TO BRENDAN
dialog: 
dialog: 28
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: His eyes turn uneasy as he removes his glasses and clicks
text: off the light.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BRENDAN'S HOUSE - DAWN
dialog: 
text: Brendan walks off into the hazy pre-dawn light.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF RAVINE
dialog: 
text: Brendan stops at a high wall of weeds, listening to the low
text: gurgle of moving water. Slowly, robotically he pushes
dialog: through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S BODY
dialog: 
text: Face down, bobbing gently in shallow water. Bluish white.
text: Red foam clings to her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL
dialog: 
text: Silently, as if lowered by a string Brendan sinks down,
text: squatting in the mud. His lungs empty in one choppy breath.
text: He pulls his glasses off sluggishly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S ARM
dialog: 
text: Lifeless, pale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN'S FACE
dialog: 
text: A contorted, frozen mask, eyes wet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY'S HAIR
dialog: 
text: Stringy, flowing gently in the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN'S EYES
dialog: 
text: Dazed, drifting... then suddenly snapping to attention.
dialog: 
text: A noise. From the tunnel.
dialog: 
text: Brendan freezes. The inky blackness of the tunnel mouth
text: opens like a vacuum... silent, but then -
dialog: 
text: The scrape of a shoe against concrete, then echoing
text: footsteps running away.
dialog: 
text: Brendan springs like a cat, sprinting into the tunnel.
dialog: 
dialog: 29
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL
dialog: 
text: Nearly pitch black. 2 sets of running footfalls. Brendan is
text: chasing, running full speed into the blackness, heart
text: pounding - we almost don't notice that Brendan's are now the
text: only footfalls.
dialog: 
text: Brendan notices. He stops. Silence in the darkness, except
dialog: for Brendan's breath... and someone near...
dialog: 
text: SLAM! Brendan takes a fist in the cheek and goes down. An
text: inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in
text: the stomach. Brendan curls on the ground, the figure over
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: (low whisper)
dialog: Your little Em.
dialog: 
text: The figure runs off. Brendan raises his head painfully - the
text: figure is silhouetted briefly against the distant bright end
text: of the tunnel, then is gone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: Emily's body is still there. Brendan crawls out of the
text: tunnel and collapses in the shallow water, beside the body.
text: He rests his head on his arm, eyes on Em's hair.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: Cold and barren, nearly empty. Brendan limps across the
text: barren lawns.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PHONE BOOTHS
dialog: 
text: A line of phone booths on campus. Brendan nearly collapses
text: against one. He dials, still in a stupor.

scene_heading: VOICE ON PHONE (cont'd)

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY
dialog: 
text: Warmly lit, sheltering the few souls scattered here and
text: there at tables. The Brain sits at one of them reading an
text: impossibly large book. He watches curiously as Brendan
text: approaches him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Hey, Brendan.
dialog: 
text: Brendan falls into a chair. The Brain looks him over.

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN (cont'd)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (thick, distant)
dialog: I couldn't sleep.

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN

dialog: Find Emily?
dialog: 
text: Brendan breathes out softly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN (cont'd)
dialog: You alright?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah. What, are you here for zero?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Nah, I gotta take the early bus, cause
text: the others don't run by my street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Bad break.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Eh. Time to read's nice. So what's the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: She's gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Can't raise her?

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: So what now?
dialog: 
dialog: 31
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Now. I don't know. I guess it's... I
dialog: don't know.
dialog: 
text: Brendan takes a long moment. He stares down at his glasses,
text: wet with condensation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: Brain, I can't let her go. I was set to
dialog: but I can't. I don't think I can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: You think you can help her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: You think you can get the straight,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah. I think I could.

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Well.
dialog: 
text: Brendan rubs his forehead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Kara tried to rope me. She came right
dialog: out and asked. She was scared. Tell me
dialog: to walk from this, Brain. Tell me to
dialog: drop it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Walk from it. Drop it.
dialog: (grins)
dialog: You're thick as what-all, Brendan.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yes I am.
dialog: 
text: Brendan cleans his glasses. He looks Brain in the eye, and
text: his mannerisms come back into focus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: I'd need you to Op. Like on Jerr, but
dialog: that was cake to this. And unlike Jerr,
dialog: there's not much chance we'll come out
dialog: clean. Twenty four seven on this one.
dialog: You okay to op for me again?
dialog: 
dialog: 32
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Brain barely smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: What first, tip the bulls?
dialog: 
text: Brendan puts on his glasses, stands to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No, bulls would gum it. They'd flash
text: their dusty standards at the wide-eyes
dialog: and probably find some yegg to pin,
dialog: probably even the right one. But they'd
text: trample the real tracks and scare the
text: real players back into their holes, and
dialog: if we're doing this I want the whole
dialog: story. No cops, not for a bit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: So what first?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I don't know. Your mom still have the
dialog: cell?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
text: In her car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Borrow it for a few days, get me the
dialog: number.
dialog: (stands to go)
dialog: Wait for my word, and cover for me first
dialog: period. I'm going to be a little late.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY
dialog: 
text: A vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball
text: courts outlined in cracked paint.1 Brendan trudges across
text: it, his steps heavy. He stops and stands very still, staring
text: at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE HORIZON
dialog: 
text: Flat, gray, pin straight. Brendan's voice starts speaking
text: rapidly, confident and clear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 1
text: This describes the location at my school that the "showdown" scenes were originally
dialog: written for. Between when I wrote the script and when we shot it, however, the school
dialog: expanded and built portable classrooms on the basketball field, and so we reluctantly
text: moved these scenes to the football field.
dialog: 
dialog: 33
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah it was personal. Jerr spooked some
dialog: decent gees and ran around some what was
dialog: straight with him, but I'm nobody's bull
dialog: runner. This wasn't a business sit. But
dialog: yeah. I bulled him. Got in tight,
text: partnered up and sent him over.
dialog: 
text: PAN AROUND to reveal BRENDAN. He looks different, edgier,
text: more alive, wearing different clothes and a thin goatee1. He
text: keeps talking directly at us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: I'd bull the lot of them, Em, I'd burn
dialog: down the whole party if they tried to
dialog: play you again. Jerr and whoever's next.
dialog: I want to keep you safe.
dialog: 
text: An ARM swings into frame, wearing cheap plastic bracelets
text: and pale blue fingernail polish. It slaps Brendan hard in
text: the face. He catches it. Emily wrenches her arm away and
text: stumbles backwards onto the pavement.
dialog: 
text: Brendan grabs her sleeve. She twists away. He grabs her
text: shoulder, grabs her waist, she resists, and suddenly they
text: are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a
text: shout she breaks away and falls to the ground.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Gulls cry in the distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You can't keep me safe, Brendan. I'm in
dialog: a bigger world now, and you can't hide
dialog: me from it, and you can't beat it. Not
dialog: if I don't want you to.
dialog: 
text: Brendan's face looks lumpish, while Emily's is strong. She
text: stands and walks off into the distance across the barren
dialog: field.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN'S FACE
dialog: 
text: Watching her go. It is back to present day, pale, clean
text: shaven, sullen. His eyes are cold with resolve.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: Brendan sloshes down into the water. Without delicacy he
text: lifts Emily's body and pulls her back into the tunnel.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RUNOFF TUNNEL
dialog: 
dialog: 1
dialog: Which Joe would not even consider, thank god.
dialog: 
dialog: 34
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Pitch back. Brendan lays the body down. Two beady eyes peer
text: at him from the darkness - he freezes. The eyes hop forward
text: - a gull. The two watch each other for a moment, then the
text: gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the
text: tunnel. Brendan follows it without looking back at the
dialog: body.1
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CROWDED HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brendan and the Brain lean against a wall. The Brain slips
text: him a piece of paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: There's the cell number.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Keep it on vibrate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: (pats his jacket pocket)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Better stop meeting me in the open too.
dialog: I'm going to start getting visible, and
dialog: I need you on the underneath. I'll call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Trueman asked for you. Wants words in
dialog: his office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I bet. Keep him off me - stonewall him,
dialog: he won't bite, just keep him away from
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: I'll try. So what's first?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Make Em's troubles mine. I'm going to
dialog: throw a few words at you, tell me if
text: they catch. Brick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 1
text: A very early draft held on the tunnel after Brendan left, and revealed a dark figure
text: (Dode) creeping away from the top of the tunnel, causing the pebble described on page
text: 1 to plink into the water.
dialog: 
dialog: 35
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Or bad brick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Tug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Tug... that might be a drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Drink?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Vodka and milk or something, or maybe
dialog: not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Poor Frisco.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Frisco. Frisco Farr1 was a sophomore
dialog: last year, I think. Real trash, maybe
dialog: hit a class a week. Didn't know him
dialog: then, and haven't seen him around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Pin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Pin... the Pin?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: The Pin, yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: The Pin's kind of a local spook story.
dialog: You know the Kingpin?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I've heard it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Same thing. Supposed to be old, like 26,
dialog: lives in town.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 1
text: All apologies to Frisco Farr, who the author did actually go to school with, and who
text: was neither a druggie nor `real trash', but was a great guy who simply had a very cool
text: sounding name. He is now (the author was horrified to learn) practicing law.
dialog: 
dialog: 36
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Jake1 runner, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Big time... maybe. Ask any dope rat
dialog: where their junk sprang they'll say they
dialog: scraped it from that who scored it from
dialog: this who bought it off so, and after
dialog: four or five connections the list'll
dialog: always end with the Pin. But I'll becha
dialog: you got every rat in town together and
dialog: said 'show your hands' if any of them've
dialog: actually seen the Pin, you'd get a crowd
text: of full pockets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You think the Pin's just a tale to take
dialog: whatever heat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: (shrugs. Beat)
dialog: But what's first?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: A show of hands.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER
dialog: 
text: Brendan strides past forest scenery and drama geeks, through
text: another door and into sunlight.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF THEATER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Kara smokes a cigarette. Brendan leans beside her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Hey Brendan. Here for the show?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: Would you go then, honey, cause I've got
dialog: this headache.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Try smoking like a chimney, I've heard
dialog: that helps.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 1
text: In an admittedly paltry concession to clarity, this was changed to `Dope runner' in post
dialog: production.
dialog: 
dialog: 37
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brendan grabs the pack of cigarettes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: Isn't this Dode's brand?
dialog: 
text: Kara snaps her head towards him, a flash of anger. She
text: catches herself and smiles cooly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: You don't know Dode's brand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Oh I do now.
dialog: 
text: Angry again, Kara snatches the pack from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: I'm going to start shaking things up.
dialog: Give me the story and you might miss the
dialog: bite.
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: The story about what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Alright.
dialog: 
text: He turns and walks away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: The story about what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I don't want to play games if you've got
dialog: a headache. Get me if you want to spill
dialog: it, but I can't guarantee safe passage
dialog: after tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: I don't know what-
text: At the stage door, not slowing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling
dialog: card, and I need words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: Brad Bramish?
text: Through the door and into the theater.
dialog: 
dialog: 38
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: He spins to see Kara's face just before the door closes.
text: She's worried.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CROWDED SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Brain walks out of a classroom and Brendan swings behind
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (fast and low)
dialog: Tail Kara through lunch. She's got
dialog: rehearsal but she'll blow early. She
dialog: goes home, drop her, else wait for my
dialog: call.
dialog: 
text: The Brain turns and Brendan's gone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - LUNCH
text: Brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a
text: cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars set aside at the far
text: end of the lot.
dialog: 
text: Brad Bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his
text: convertible, front door open. A small crowd hangs about
text: Brad, his crony Biff at his elbow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: That's all I'm saying, is put me in the
dialog: game and I'll do what needs to be done,
dialog: but they don't put me in, what needs
dialog: doing don't get done and don't come
dialog: crying to me, man. Get off my grill man,
dialog: you didn't put me in, don't come to me
dialog: if you didn't let me play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIFF
dialog: They didn't!
dialog: 
text: Brendan scans the rest of the cars. His eyes catch on Laura
text: Dannon sitting in another convertible, off to the side. Her
text: bright eyes cut through the crowd, straight into Brendan.
dialog: 
text: He wags his eyebrows at her. She looks away. Brendan walks
text: into Brad's direct line of view and obviously leans against
text: one of the cars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Hey! What are you doing here?
dialog: 
dialog: 39
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: Listening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Alright, you got me. I'm a scout for the
dialog: Gophers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (not amused)
dialog: Oh yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Of all things, yeah. Been watching your
dialog: game for a month, but that story just
dialog: now clenched it. You've got heart, kid.
dialog: How soon can you move to Minneapolis?
dialog: 
text: A few snickers around the crowd, but nowhere near Brad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: (flat with anger)
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Cold winters, but they've got a great
dialog: public transit system.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Oh yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: There's a thesaurus in the library.
dialog: 'Yeah's under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Who invited you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: To the parking lot? Well gee I kind of
dialog: invited myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I think you'd better leave then.
dialog: 
dialog: 40
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No, I'm having too good a time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Just the same.
dialog: 
text: Brendan smiles slightly, and very deliberately crosses his
text: legs. Brad's face tenses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD (cont'd)
dialog: Maybe you want to go someplace more
dialog: private.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: With you?
dialog: 
text: Brad says 'who else?' by lifting his arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: (as if he's been asked to the
dialog: movies)
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 
text: Brendan stands and walks off. Brad follows and the rest of
text: the crowd trails after him.
dialog: 
text: He leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad.
text: People gather around in a wide circle.
dialog: 
text: Brendan pulls his jacket off as Brad hangs back, mumbling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: You know what's good for you you'll just
dialog: beat it. Beating a small frye won't win
dialog: me anything and it's not going to do you
dialog: any good-
dialog: 
text: Laura pulls up in her convertible, behind Brad, watching.
dialog: 
text: In the next moment Brendan cuts Brad off by putting his fist
text: in his face.
dialog: 
text: Brad grunts but doesn't lose ground. Brendan throws his
text: short stocky frame into Brad's larger one and tenderizes his
text: midsection with jabs.
dialog: 
text: Brad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his
text: hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the
dialog: pavement.
dialog: 
text: He comes at Brendan with his big fists clenched.
dialog: 
text: Brendan kicks Brad full force in the shins.
dialog: 
dialog: 41
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brad tumbles, and Brendan comes up fast, connecting hard
text: with the point of Brad's chin. Brad gets his balance fast,
text: and before Brendan can throw another he throws one himself,
text: then another, both into Brendan's stomach. Brendan pulls
text: back and kicks Brad's shin where he had kicked it before.
text: Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face.
dialog: 
text: Brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his
text: weight into a square punch right into Brad's nose.
dialog: 
text: The sound of eggs breaking, and Brad falls backwards like a
dialog: board.
dialog: 
text: He stays down, holding his face.
dialog: 
text: Brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the
text: small crowd. Some stare at Brendan, some at Brad, but nobody
text: seems about to do anything. Brendan runs his sleeve over his
text: face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few
text: people rushing over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRAGGLER
dialog: Hey, is there a fight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: He throws a last look at Laura, who meets his gaze and
text: drives off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Brendan walks away from the lot, towards the school. Laura
text: pulls up beside him in her car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: Brendan ignores her and b-lines for the school. Laura brakes
text: hard, parking by the curb.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Brendan limps down the hallway. Laura appears behind him,
text: trotting to catch up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You're quite a pill.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 
dialog: 42
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Where are you going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Why did you take a powder the other
dialog: night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Same reason I'm taking one now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Hold it.
dialog: (he keeps walking)
dialog: I don't get you. That's a chilly heel to
dialog: be giving a girl who's where you want to
dialog: know about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I'll get where I'm going just fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I want to help you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Go away.
dialog: 
text: Silence behind him. He stops, turns wearily. She looks
text: genuinely hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: Look, I can't trust you. You ought to be
dialog: smart enough to know that. I didn't
dialog: shake the party up to get your
dialog: attention, and I'm not heeling you to
dialog: hook you. Your connections could help
dialog: me, but the bad baggage they bring could
dialog: make it zero sum game or even hurt me,
dialog: so I'm better off coming at it clean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I wouldn't have to lead you in by the
dialog: hand-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I can't trust you. Brad was a sap, you
dialog: weren't, you were with him and so you
dialog: were playing him, so you're a player.
dialog: With you behind me I'd have to tie one
dialog: eye up watching both your hands, and I
dialog: can't spare it.
dialog: 
dialog: 43
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You're not Brad.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No, I'm not.

text: He turns and walks away. She doesn't follow.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PAYPHONE - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Brendan slumps against it, receiver to his ear, licking a
text: bruised lip. He wears dark glasses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: You didn't call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Sorry. Kara went home though, didn't
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
text: Yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and
dialog: made two calls that she didn't want on
dialog: her phone bill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Get the numbers?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No. Sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: S'alright. Are me and Brad front page
dialog: news?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: All the buzz. You really do that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Why? Is Brad the Pin?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Brad's a sap. I downed him on his field
dialog: and his crew didn't bite. So now I know
dialog: he's a sap and anyone who acts like he
dialog: isn't is profiting by it. That's not why
dialog: I roughed him, though.
dialog: 
dialog: 44
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAIN
dialog: For kicks?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Economics. Brad's the school's biggest
dialog: jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all
dialog: the selling, I just got his attention.
dialog: Anyway, now's just shaking things out.
dialog: Look, you know a kid around the burgh,
text: lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black
dialog: tang?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: I told you before I don't know the car.
dialog: Those types are a nickel a pound, but
dialog: nobody I know that you don't. And
dialog: Trueman again-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Keep him off. And keep your specs on - I
dialog: need to find that kid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: Brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly.
dialog: 
text: A lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots
text: punches him in the face.
dialog: 
text: Brendan hits the pavement. The lanky kid is over him in a
text: split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy
dialog: blows.
dialog: 
text: Flashes of the lanky kid - a shiny scar shaped like a thin
text: triangle runs down the side of his face.
dialog: 
text: After a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with
text: several other blurry figures. A car peels out and roars off
dialog: O.S.
dialog: 
text: Brendan lies still. The class bell rings, very distant. Legs
text: criss cross before his eyes, each blurring the world a bit
text: more until it is completely smeared.

dialog: exercise a little more tact, Mr. Frye.
dialog: You can't pull a play like that unless I
dialog: need you for something. So do I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Maybe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUEMAN
dialog: So maybe you're gonna need me too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Maybe. Alright, I need you off my back
dialog: completely for a few weeks. There might
dialog: be some heat soon.
dialog: 
dialog: 47
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUEMAN
dialog: (interested)
dialog: If it's something I can't cover, I won't
dialog: go to bat for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: If I get caught like that it's curtains
dialog: anyway - I couldn't have brass cutting
dialog: me favors in public. I'm just saying now
dialog: so you don't come kicking in my homeroom
text: door once trouble starts.
dialog: 
text: Trueman bites a thumbnail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUEMAN
dialog: Okay, here's what I can do. I won't pin
dialog: you for anything you aren't caught at.
dialog: I'll ride it a little while, as long as
dialog: it doesn't get too rough. But if
dialog: anything comes up with your fingerprints
dialog: on it, I can't help you. Also, if I get
dialog: to the end of whatever this is and it
dialog: gets hot and you don't deliver, The Veep
dialog: will need someone to hand over, police-
dialog: wise. And I'll have you. There better be
dialog: some meat at the end of this like you
dialog: say, or at least a fall guy, or you're
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Sure I am. Got one more favor to ask.

scene_heading: EXT. PAYPHONE BY CARROWS - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No, Dode's MIA all around.
dialog: 
dialog: 48
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I'm 9 of 10 that Kara's got him, but who
dialog: knows where. I shook but she's not
text: spilling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No more job offers? So she's got a play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: And I know enough about Kara to let that
dialog: worry me. Alright, keep your specs on
dialog: for him. Any other news?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Some. Laura Dannon came to me looking
dialog: for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (considers this)
dialog: She did, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Fourth period, nearly shook me upside
dialog: down. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but
dialog: why'd she come to me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you
dialog: know me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Yeah, well. She's some piece of work. If
dialog: I had known where you were I might have
dialog: told her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: That's the spirit. Ask around for Dode,
dialog: tail Kara again at lunch. I got knives
dialog: in my eyes, I'm going home sick. I'll
dialog: call you tonight.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Bordering a supermarket. Brendan trudges along. Suddenly he
text: stops. Parked in the supermarket parking lot is a black
dialog: mustang.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The sun hangs low. Brendan approaches the car and walks
text: around it slowly. He peers inside. A tuft of paper pokes out
text: from under the seat. He pulls the door handle, locked.
dialog: 
dialog: 49
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground,
text: waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head,
text: ready to drop it through the window.
dialog: 
text: He stops. His eyes catch something in the distance.
dialog: 
text: The lanky shaved-head kid, whose name is Tugger. Coming
text: towards him fast.
dialog: 
text: Brendan stands there for a moment, then lets the chunk fall
text: to the ground. He casually leans against the car, removes
text: his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case
text: in his pocket.
dialog: 
text: Tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the
text: pavement. Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys.
dialog: 
text: Brendan gets up and comes towards Tug, his face stiff. Tug
text: turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth. Brendan falls
text: to his knees.
dialog: 
text: While Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily.
text: Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him
text: back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth,
text: three times. When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone,
text: catching himself on his hands and knees. The car door slams.
dialog: 
text: The mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the
text: parking lot, spins around and stops, facing Brendan. Its
text: motor purrs deeply. Brendan begins to limp towards it
text: doggedly, head up, eyes fixed.
dialog: 
text: A crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang
text: forward. It comes straight at Brendan, rumbling like a tank.
dialog: 
text: Brendan stops walking and stands very still, eyes steady.
text: The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all.
dialog: 
text: It speeds past him not six inches to his left, brushing the
text: edge of his jacket. Brakes squeal behind him. Brendan turns
text: and lopes towards the mustang, idling about fifty feet away.
dialog: 
text: He stops at the window. Tugger eyes him curiously, with
dialog: some respect.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I want to see the Pin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: (nods slightly)
dialog: Yeah, I guess you do.
dialog: 
dialog: 50
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS
dialog: 
text: Twisty and narrow. The black mustang flies through them at
text: impossible speeds, roaring past like a bullet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARKNESS
dialog: 
text: Loud engine noise, jostling, grunting. Then a metallic
text: jangle, some scraping, and a CLINK!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. REAR OF FAST MOVING MUSTANG - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The trunk pops open, revealing Brendan holding a jack rod.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOVING MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Tug is putting a tape in the deck, eyes down. Behind him
text: the trunk pops open, then pulls down out of sight just as he
text: looks back up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUNK OF MOVING MUSTANG
text: Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough
text: to see which street signs pass by. Loud music plays from the
dialog: car -- "Sweet Baby James" by James Taylor.1
dialog: 
text: The car zooms on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN'S POV
dialog: 
text: Through the ajar trunk. The mustang slides to a stop beside
text: an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle's head.
text: Brendan closes the trunk.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: A small one story house, slightly run down. Tugger opens the
text: trunk and drags Brendan out, covering his eyes with a palm,
text: slams the trunk and goes inside.
dialog: 
text: When they are gone the broken trunk drifts open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: A very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one end,
text: dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the other
text: end. Tugger drags Brendan down the stairway, drops him and
text: goes into the lit room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 1
text: Unfortunately Mr. Taylor flatly refused, which, given the context, was probably wise.
dialog: 
dialog: 51
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brendan lifts his head painfully. Surrounding him in the
text: darkened doorways are dozens of boys, some dressed like
text: Tugger, others dressed in black.
dialog: 
text: Tug pokes his head out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Alright.
dialog: 
text: Arms pop out of the darkness and drag Brendan towards the
text: lit room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KINGPIN'S DEN
dialog: 
text: A small room, amazingly messy. Clothes strewn about, groves
text: of empty bottles, precarious piles of books. The overall
text: impression though is not of jumbled chaos, but of a nest,
text: comfortably woven and very worn in.
dialog: 
text: A slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall at a
text: small desk, writing under a green bookkeeper's lamp.
dialog: 
text: Brendan is shoved into the center of the room. Tug and his
text: clones slump against the surrounding walls. Brendan watches
text: the thin figure's back. For a beat the only noise is the
text: scratching of the thin man's pencil. Then he sighs and
text: swivels around.
dialog: 
text: Mid to late twenties. Sallow features, tired eyes. His
text: clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out
text: specific items -- he is just one inky black mass from the
text: neck down and eyebrows up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You the Pin?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (beat of silence)
dialog: So now I'm very very curious what you're
dialog: going to say next.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Maybe I'll just sit and bleed at you.
dialog: 
text: The Pin shifts in his seat, bored.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Helled if you're gonna go breaking my
dialog: best clients' noses and expect me to
dialog: play sandbag. Anyway you've been
text: sniffing me out before then, sniffing
dialog: for me like a vampire bat for a horse
dialog: 
dialog: 52
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: with a nick on its ear he can suck on.
dialog: They do that.
dialog: (Brendan blinks)
dialog: So now you got Tugger to bring you here,
dialog: which he never does, and you got me
dialog: listening, so I'm curious what you've
dialog: got to say that better be really, really
dialog: good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Call Ms. Dannon in from the hall first;
dialog: she oughta hear this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: (amused)
dialog: No dice, soldier. Would have been a neat
dialog: trick, though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (shrugs, then slowly)
dialog: I was going to make up some bit of
dialog: information or set up some phony deal,
dialog: anything so you'd let me walk. Then I
dialog: was going to go to the vice principal
dialog: and spill him the street address of the
text: biggest dope port in the burgh.
dialog: 
text: The Pin's eyes shoot to Tugger, who doesn't flinch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: He knows zippo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: 1250 Vista Blanca, the ink blotter at
text: the desk in the den in the basement of
text: the house with the tacky mailbox.
dialog: 
text: The world turns on its side as Tugger pushes Brendan's head
text: down into the carpet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: You gonna do what now?!
dialog: 
text: The Pin walks towards them. One of his shoes is twice the
dialog: size of the other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: No good, soldier.
dialog: 
text: The cronies around the room begin cackling. Tug's face is a
text: mask of rage. Brendan can't breath. His face swells.
dialog: 
dialog: 53
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN (cont'd)
dialog: Alright, let up.
dialog: 
text: But Tug doesn't let up. Brendan's world grows hazy, the
text: cackling laughter reverberates, then a clean voice pierces
dialog: the din.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (OS)
dialog: Tug, stop.
dialog: 
text: Tug's face breaks for a moment, and he lets go. Brendan's
text: head lolls to the side. Laura stands in the dark doorway.
dialog: 
text: Brendan sees Tug's knuckles and a flash of white for a split
text: moment as Tug hits him in the face. The Pin's black body
text: spills out across the frame, leaving us in black.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE UP
dialog: 
scene_heading: SMALL DARK ROOM
dialog: 
text: Brendan wakes up curled on a mattress on the floor. A bare
text: light bulb hangs from the ceiling. Tugger sits five feet
text: away, watching him like a hungry dog. Brendan stares back at
text: him through thick, glazed eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Where are my glasses?
dialog: (Tugger grins)
dialog: Hell with ya then. Which wall's the door
dialog: in?
dialog: 
text: Tug points, amused. Brendan heaves himself up, and Tug
text: shoves him back down.
dialog: 
text: Brendan winks at him, stands and lurches towards the door
dialog: again.
dialog: 
text: Tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall, but
text: freezes when he hears a door latch click. Sneering, he drops
text: Brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite
dialog: wall.
dialog: 
text: Sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness.
text: Light footsteps clack on the cement floor. Suddenly Tug
text: vanishes -- the room's darkness just seems to swallow him.
dialog: 
text: The thin whispery voice of the Pin speaks softly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Sorry about this kid, but what the hell
dialog: with what you said before.
dialog: 
dialog: 54
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: His disembodied face appears a few feet about where Tug had
dialog: sat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN (cont'd)
dialog: Where you were at, with all of us and
dialog: the Tug a fist away, you've got to use
dialog: your nut. Allay the situation, So yeah,
dialog: you're not scared of me, I got it, but
dialog: I'm also thinking you're a little nuts
dialog: now, so you've got that trade off with
dialog: your standing. But nuts isn't all bad,
dialog: so maybe it was a good play. I don't
dialog: know.
dialog: 
text: He is standing in front of Tug. His black clothes and broad
text: rimmed black hat blend perfectly with the dark room, such
text: that his face seems to bob about in space. Brendan stifles a
dialog: cough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN (cont'd)
dialog: So, Laura talked me down. Let's get you
text: upstairs, back with the living.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brendan sits at a breakfast table eating cornflakes. The
text: kitchen is on the first floor of the Pin's house, or rather
text: the Pin's mother's house. She is a soft old lady in a pastel
text: cotton dress, currently bent over the fridge mumbling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I thought we had orange juice, Brendan,
dialog: I'm sorry. How about Tang, or that's
dialog: more like soda isn't it, or not soda but
dialog: it hasn't got any juice in it, it can't
dialog: be very fortifying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Water's fine, ma'am, thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Now just a moment, we have apple juice
dialog: here, if you'd like that, or milk,
dialog: though you've got that in your
dialog: cornflakes, I don't know if drinking it
dialog: as well might be too much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Apple juice sounds terrific.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: It's country style.
dialog: 
dialog: 55
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: That's perfect.
dialog: 
text: She shuts the fridge. Tugger and the Pin sit behind her,
text: looking comfortably bored. The Pin, a sharp black hole
text: against the soft yellow kitchen, eats oatmeal cookies with
text: small delicate bites.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I'll even give it to you in a country
dialog: glass, how'd that be? Boys?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: I'm fine, Mrs. M.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Thanks, mom.
dialog: 
text: The Pin kisses her on the cheek.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Okay, well I'm going to go, um, do
text: something in the other room now...
dialog: 
text: She shuffles out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: (to Brendan)
dialog: So hows bout we take another snap at
dialog: hearing your tale?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I don't know. It starts out same as
dialog: before, and this floor ain't carpeted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: We're cooled off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah well, your muscle seemed plenty
dialog: cool putting his fist in my head. I want
text: him out.
dialog: 
text: The Pin grins thinly, uncomfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Looky, soldier-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: The ape blows or I clam.
dialog: 
dialog: 56
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: (stands violently)
dialog: So clam! What've you got I can't beat
dialog: out of you back in the basement?
dialog: 
text: The Pin and Brendan are perfectly still, watching each
dialog: other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Give us a few minutes, Tug.
dialog: 
text: Tug turns to him, but Pin keeps his eyes on Brendan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN (cont'd)
dialog: I'll call you if whatever.
dialog: 
text: Beat. Tug stomps off, slamming the narrow door hard behind
text: him. The Pin goes back to gnawing his cookie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN (cont'd)
dialog: So?
dialog: 
text: Brendan sets down his spoon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: About a year ago I had a small time
text: dealing partnership with Jerr Madison.
dialog: Know him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Till he took the fall for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah well. I didn't ask him to, but he
dialog: was a straight player. I got out clean -
dialog: almost. Nothing on my official record,
dialog: but the VPs play it like I owe them one.
dialog: When I made it clear I wasn't playing
dialog: their hound dog, well they didn't like
dialog: it. They keep calling me in, badgering
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Gee that's tough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I don't like being told whose side I'm
dialog: on. So now they think I'm on your trail,
dialog: I'm in a nice spot to know their
dialog: movements and feed them yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: I gotcha.
dialog: 
dialog: 57
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You haven't got me yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: What, price?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Considering the benefits my services
dialog: could yield, I don't think that's
dialog: unreasonable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: And what are your services exactly, just
dialog: so I can be specific on the invoice?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Whatever serves your interests.
dialog: 
text: The Pin stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Fair enough. I'll have my boys check
dialog: your tale, and seeing how it stretches
dialog: we'll either rub or hire you. You'll
dialog: know which by end of the day tomorrow.
dialog: 
text: Brendan stands but doesn't follow as the Pin opens the
text: narrow door Tugger went through and descends the dark stairs
text: behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN (cont'd)
dialog: We're done.
dialog: 
text: The moment the Pin vanishes into the basement's murk Laura
text: comes up out of it. She takes Brendan's hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I'll drive you back.
scene_heading: INT. LAURA'S CONVERTIBLE MOVING - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: They zig zag though the twisty suburban streets. Brendan

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Just drop me at school.
dialog: (they take a hard turn)
dialog: How long was I out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Half an hour. It took all of it for me
text: to cool the Pin down.
dialog: 
dialog: 58
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (flatly, but sincerely)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DUSK

text: He studies her face for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You trust me now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Less than when I didn't trust you
dialog: before. If you can tell me your angle in
dialog: this, maybe I can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Come here.1
dialog: 
text: Brendan leans on the car, his face close to hers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
text: I'm on the in, top level of the tower
dialog: and I know everyone, but I don't know
dialog: all what goes on. I knew Em when she
dialog: tried to get with me and Brad, and I
dialog: liked her. She was smart. But she wasn't
dialog: us, and it didn't work. When she left
dialog: she took some souvenirs, dirty habits
dialog: she wasn't strong enough to control and
dialog: a connection to the Pin to keep them
dialog: going. With me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: So far.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
text: A few months go by, and the next I hear
text: the Pin's raging over a situation with
dialog: some certain junk Em was partial to, and
text: the downfall's coming on Em's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I don't know, but whether she scraped or
text: copped or just ran her tab around the
dialog: world and into her own back, it must
dialog: have been grand. I've never seen the Pin
dialog: so hot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: This all helps but it's not what I
dialog: asked. What's your angle in all this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I don't know. I'm usually pretty sharp,
dialog: but... maybe I see what you're doing for
dialog: Emily, trying to help her. And I don't
dialog: know anyone who would do that for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Now you are dangerous.
dialog: 
text: Throwing the car in gear, she peels out and leaves him

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

dialog: you? Told her my tale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: All part of your plan?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Turned out to be.

speaker_heading: KARA
dialog: We were a pair and a half for a few

dialog: I'll have the Pin and Tug in my corner
dialog: soon. The sooner I get the truth from
dialog: Dode or the truth about Dode from you,
dialog: the safer you'll both be. No? Pass it on
dialog: to Dode anyway. Maybe he'll have the

text: Brendan's at his desk, on the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: So what happens now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: Now we wait for the Pin's answer. Unless
text: his crew spotted VP Truman's social call
dialog: this morning, it'll be yes. I'd give us
dialog: 70/30. If we're in I get under his skin
dialog: and see what's what. You stick to Kara,
dialog: keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay
text: away from Laura.
dialog: 
text: The Brain is quiet for a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: I think she's with us, Brendan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (too sharp)
dialog: I'll let you know when she is.
dialog: 
text: A beat of silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: Brendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment
text: in silence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOCKER CAGE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: The class bell rings, and the cage quickly empties. Brendan
text: limps in, opens his locker. A note falls to his feet. It is
text: folded into a star. He pulls it open. "TWELVE THIRTY PICO &amp;
scene_heading: ALEXANDER".
text: He fishes the old note out and compares them - different
dialog: handwriting.
dialog: 
dialog: 62
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the
text: steady sound of heavy footfalls. Brendan looks up from the
dialog: notes.
dialog: 
text: A lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him. He wears a
text: black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders, and his black hair
text: comes down over his eyes like a sheepdog's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You the Pin's?
dialog: 
text: No answer. The lug keeps coming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: So what's his answer?
dialog: 
text: Closer, not slowing. Brendan tightens his hand into a fist.
text: Then CLICK! and a long slender switchblade gleams in the
text: lug's right paw.
dialog: 
text: Brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso.
text: Before the lug winds up for another slash Brendan is
dialog: running.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS SQUARE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug
text: follows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Wind rushing, sweating, the lug very close. Their footsteps
text: clatter on the cement. Brendan swings around a corner,
text: doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost
text: sight of him.
dialog: 
text: Brendan sweats, listening. The lug's footsteps echo through
text: the hallways, coming from all directions at once. Then it
text: seems clear - he's down the hall on Brendan's right.
text: Brendan dashes left. Wrong. The lug looms over him, his
text: knife hand flashing. Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open,
text: and the white filling inside turns red. He stumbles back
text: blindly, gets his footing and scrambles out of reach.
dialog: 
text: Brendan sprints away, down the hall, gaining about thirty
text: feet on the lug before turning the corner.
dialog: 
text: Brendan drops to a sitting position.
dialog: 
text: THE LUG AROUND THE CORNER
dialog: 
text: Running fast.
dialog: 
dialog: 63
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: 
text: Kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet. The lug's
text: footsteps are impossibly loud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE LUG
dialog: 
text: Just about to round the corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: 
text: On his socked feet running silently back towards the corner.
text: The lug's footsteps crash like symbols as they both come
text: around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed.
dialog: 
text: Brendan slides like a baseball player, tangling his legs
text: into the lug's. The lug pitches forward with frightening
text: momentum. He hits the hall's metal handrail with his arms
text: and head. A hollow gong reverberates through the hallway,
text: and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut.
text: A wallet with a couple of twenties and a student ID (CHUCK
text: BURNS), three hash pipes, fifteen joints, a baggie of weed
text: and a large brownie in another baggie.
dialog: 
text: Brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS PAYPHONE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brendan breathes heavily into the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: Chuck Burns, big lug with hair like a
text: sheepdog.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Yeah I know him, I just can't pin him to
dialog: any crowd. He's definitely not muscle
text: for anyone. He taps the Carrows crowd
dialog: but doesn't hang with them. If you've
dialog: got a guess I could check it out-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: The Pin. If he's with the Pin
dialog: everything's kablooie and I gotta blow
text: the burgh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: I'll check it. I'm in third now-
text: Brendan spots the Pin's Cady pulling into the parking lot.
dialog: 
dialog: 64
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Never mind. If I don't call by three
text: call in the bulls.
dialog: 
text: Brendan hangs up and begins walking at a normal pace along
text: the sidewalk.
dialog: 
text: The cady pulls up beside him, and he stops walking. The door
text: swings open and a voice comes from inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Get in.
dialog: 
text: With no perceivable hesitation, he does.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CADILAC - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brendan sits beside the Pin. The windows are tinted and the
text: car is very dark. The seats are pink vinyl. The car lurches
dialog: forward.
text: Brendan and the Pin are silent for a beat, not looking at
dialog: each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: So?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
text: So. Tangles.
dialog: 
text: A stocky kid in the front seat turns, and reaches into his
text: jacket. For a moment he stays like that, hand in his jacket,
text: eyes on Brendan. Brendan's face is placid.
dialog: 
text: Tangles pulls out an envelope and drops it in Brendan's lap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN (cont'd)
dialog: That's what you'll get every week for
dialog: your services. Less of course there's a
dialog: specific job involved, in where you get
dialog: sliced in with my crew. Square?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: Silence. The Pin holds his hat in his hands, fingering the
dialog: rim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: We're doing a thing down at the Hole
dialog: tonight. Know it?
dialog: 
dialog: 65
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: South of T Street, yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: It's sort of a welcome you in thing.
text: Eight o'clock.
dialog: 
text: The car stops.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS PAYPHONE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brendan climbs out of the car on the exact spot they picked
text: him up. The Cady drives off. Brendan checks his watch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN'S WATCH
dialog: 
text: 12:32. A phone begins to ring.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PICO &amp; ALEXANDER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brendan looks up from his watch and answers the payphone,
text: holding the receiver to his ear in silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: I know what you did. I saw what you
dialog: did.1
dialog: 
text: The voice is low and garbled, filtered through something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: So?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Anyone I tell, it would ruin you some
dialog: way. And I'm going to tell someone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Are you making an offer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Maybe. Or maybe I'll just do you in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Hire another hash head to blade me?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 1
dialog: Originally the source of this call was supposed to be a mystery, but during post
text: production we decided it was one layer too many, and identified the caller as Dode.
text: Brendan's first line was overdubbed in post to say `Dode?" instead of "So?"
dialog: 
dialog: 66
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Don't need no blades, shamus. I just
dialog: gotta squawk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Just to see you sweat.
dialog: 
text: CLICK. Brendan replaces the receiver and stands still for a
text: moment. Then he inserts a coin and dials.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Brendan?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: You alright?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah, I'm fine. Keep digging on the
text: Burns lug, but the main thing is to find
text: Dode. He set up whatever Emily walked
dialog: into, it's getting more and more urgent
dialog: we talk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Alright. Trueman was looking for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Trueman and the VP?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No, just Trueman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Asked for me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No, but looked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: That's not good. Alright, keep me
dialog: posted.
dialog: 
text: Brendan hangs up.
dialog: 
dialog: 67

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT1
dialog: 
text: A bonfire burns about a hundred feet off. Figures jump
text: through the blaze to thrash music. The Pin and Brendan
text: wander towards us on the dark beach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: So I'm going to start you on the dope
text: circles, cleaning up the Turkish dues,
text: pulling in the strags.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: Small fries.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Yeah, well. Just to see how you handle.
dialog: Anyway there isn't much else doing. I'm
dialog: tailing out this big deal, but that's
dialog: almost done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Oh yeah? What was it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Big time. Biggest I ever done, and there
dialog: was a snag in it, but it's almost done
dialog: now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What was it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
text: It's over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Almost, you said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: It's over enough. You're gonna make me
text: curious, being so curious.
dialog: 
text: They sit in the sand, facing the breakers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN (cont'd)
dialog: I gotta lay something out. You're coming
dialog: into a certain situation, and I'm
dialog: bringing you in sort of because of it.
dialog: 
dialog: 1
dialog: If ever you want to witness a look of pure horror, shoot a micro budget feature film and
dialog: tell your cinematographer that there will be an extended scene on a beach at night.
text: Turns out it's difficult to light up a beach without very large and expensive equipment.
text: Who knew. Shooting at sunset proved a fortunate and less horror inducing solution.
dialog: 
dialog: 68
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I didn't tell Tugger to hit you for the
dialog: Brad Bramish thing. Laura and I, I
dialog: decided I oughta hear what you were
dialog: gunning for before I made an enemy. Tug
dialog: just did it, though. He was hot, and he
dialog: just hit you. He's been doing that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: He's got my best interests, I know, he's
dialog: loyal, he just gets hot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Muscle you can't control's no good at
dialog: that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: You're working for me, not Tug, that's
dialog: all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Alright.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A moment of silence. The breakers crash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Things can get, you know, it's tough
dialog: sometimes. Twisted, complicated,
dialog: watching all the, I don't know.
dialog: Everyone's got their thing.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: You read Tolkien?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Tolkien, the Hobbit books?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: His descriptions of things are really
dialog: good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Oh yeah?
dialog: 
dialog: 69
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: He makes you want to be there.
dialog: 
text: The waves crash. Behind them, with no warning at all, a
text: train shoots by. Tug stands with his hands jammed in his
text: pockets, flashing lights and gleaming metal streaking and
text: squealing behind him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BRENDAN'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: The clock radio blinks 5:34. The phone is ringing. Brendan
text: half wakes and puts it to his ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Don't go to class.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
text: Fifth period Trueman and the VP come in
dialog: asking for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Agh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Did they call your mom?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Probably. I got home late.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Get out of there too, then. Meet me
dialog: behind the library. I've got some stuff.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF LIBRARY - EARLY MORNING
text: A cold gray morning. The Brain hands Brendan a photocopy of
text: a newspaper clipping, "LOCAL YOUTH HOSPITALIZED"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
text: Frisco Farr was found on a sidewalk
text: outside Pinkerton's Deli three weeks
text: ago. He was in a coma, his stomach
text: contained a sausage sandwich, a horse
text: dose of Heroin and traces of Choleric
dialog: Tricemate, a poisonous chemical found in
text: laundry detergent. Frisco's still under
dialog: 
dialog: 70
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: and nobody's talking, so nothing's come
dialog: of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: OD?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No, the chem the junk must have been cut
text: with put him down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Huh. Bad junk. Bad brick... could that
dialog: form of Heroin be called 'Brick'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No -- it was a concentrated powder, its
dialog: street handle's 'whip' or 'rock' or
dialog: 'brock'.
dialog: (fishes a note from his
dialog: pocket)
dialog: Here. From Laura.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I told you to stay clear of Laura.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: You tell her to stay clear of me?
dialog: 
text: He gives the note to Brendan, who unfolds it roughly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (mutters)
dialog: I gotta get voicemail.
dialog: 
dialog: The note reads "Meet me at the southeast corner of the
text: school at 9:30." Brendan crumples it into a ball.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: No. Tell her I'll be at the Pin's at
dialog: one. Any luck with the lug?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: The Brain lays out a local newspaper with Emily's picture -
text: "LOCAL GIRL MISSING". Uncomfortable silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: This isn't good.
dialog: 
text: The Brain looks hard at him. Brendan stares off into space
text: for a beat, then takes the Brain's cell phone and dials.
dialog: 
dialog: 71
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Mr. Trueman please.
dialog: 
text: Brendan compares the two notes from his pocket with Laura's
text: - distinct handwriting on each.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUEMAN
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: This is Trueman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What the hell are you doing asking for

speaker_heading: TRUEMAN
dialog: What the hell are you doing out of
dialog: class?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUEMAN
dialog: (very deliberate)
dialog: The VP and I needed to ask you a few
dialog: questions about Emily Kostich, who you
dialog: might have heard is missing. It's a very
text: serious thing. The police are involved.
dialog: The VP and I knew you two were close, so
dialog: the VP and I came to ask you questions,
dialog: but you were truant. If you don't have a
dialog: valid excuse-
dialog: 
text: Brendan hangs up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: I've been cut loose. I'm not safe here.
dialog: We shouldn't have met in the open.
dialog: Alright, lay low, but ask on the
dialog: underneath for Dode. That's all that
dialog: matters now, find Dode, but do it on the
dialog: underneath, got it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: What are you going to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I'd like to have played it safe, but
text: there's no time. The Pin's not letting
dialog: 
dialog: 72
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: anything drop, so I gotta push things a
dialog: bit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I don't know. Just find Dode.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE PIN'S HOUSE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The bird of prey mailbox looms ominously. Brendan knocks on
text: the front door. No answer. He presses lightly on the screen
text: door, and it gives.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
dialog: 
text: Empty. Brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens
text: the narrow basement door. He descends into inky gloom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
text: Deathly still and silent. Barely breathing, Brendan goes to
text: the lit doorway at the end of the hall.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PIN'S DEN - SAME
dialog: 
text: Empty. Brendan floats through the room like a ghost, to the
text: Pin's desk.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, then with greater confidence he rifles through it -
text: papers and trinkets, meaningless.
dialog: 
text: He reaches beneath the desk, knocking it gently with his
text: knuckles. Quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down
text: into the desk frame.
dialog: 
text: Brendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches
text: thick. He pulls out another. Another. Another. Thumbing the
dialog: stacks -- pure hundreds.
dialog: 
text: Something creaks in the hallway.
dialog: 
text: Brendan freezes. Silently he replaces the money and drawer,
text: his eyes on the doorway. He creeps towards the door on the
text: balls of his feet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
dialog: 
text: Still empty. Brendan creeps towards the stairs, passing
text: other doorways, all open but for one. He stops for a moment,
dialog: listening - silence.
dialog: 
dialog: 73
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM - SAME
dialog: 
text: Brendan enters the room - pitch black but for a small high
text: window. Brendan pulls the curtains aside. A beam of sunlight
text: spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark.
text: Brendan jumps back, and his reflection in the large mirror
dialog: jumps as well.
dialog: 
text: A white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark
dialog: room.
dialog: 
text: Brendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light,
text: reflecting it around the room like a flashlight. More junk,
text: a mattress, then a strangely bare corner with a single white
text: lump in it. The white bird stands behind the lump, its dark
text: eyes caught in the bare light.
dialog: 
text: The bird flies out the window.
dialog: 
text: Brendan goes to the white lump, a small brick of white
text: powder. White chalky residue patterns the floor -- there
dialog: were other bricks there before.
dialog: 
text: Behind Brendan, in the mirror, something moves. Someone
text: else, in the room.
dialog: 
text: Tugger. He throws Brendan across the room, then heaves him
text: into a wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: What with the poking, genius?! Maybe
dialog: you're poking for your bull friends!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Don't be a sap. I can't even face up at
dialog: school, the VP's so hot for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Yeah well. Maybe you're looking to make
dialog: good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I'm looking to find this big game the
dialog: Pin's played, not to gum it, but just so
dialog: when its tail jams in my back I'll know
dialog: who to bill for the embalming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: You oughta ask him what you wanna know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I did. He didn't tell me.
dialog: 
dialog: 74
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Tug loosens his grip. Brendan gasps for air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: When a gee I'm paid to side with won't
dialog: give me the straight that makes me
dialog: nervous. Makes me angry.
dialog: 
text: Tug draws back a bit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Yeah, well. That's understandable.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tug sets a country glass of orange juice in front of
text: Brendan. He paces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: There was ten of them. I don't know
dialog: where he picked them, he didn't tell me.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (sympathetic)
dialog: Huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: So we get ten kils of brock, there aint
dialog: enough marks in the whole burgh to eat
text: that. So he unloads eight of em up way
dialog: north, even up to the docks. I don't
dialog: know who.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Didn't tell you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Yeah. That was eight. So that's the
dialog: tenth in there. We gotta break it into
dialog: doses, sell em off round the high, maybe
text: some by Shorecliffs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What about the ninth brick?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Ah yeah. There were problems with that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: It, uh...
dialog: 
dialog: 75
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He stops, thinking harder than he's used to. His scar
text: reddens slightly, then he jerks out of his trance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER (cont'd)
dialog: (quickly)
text: It disappeared. Someone skimmed it. We
dialog: started raising hell with all the likely
dialog: suspects, and whatayaknow, it came back.
dialog: But it came back bad. One of ours took a
text: dose off the top, and it laid him out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Frisco.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Yeah, poor Frisco. You heard about that.
dialog: We'll track down the rat. Just takes
dialog: time.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: TUGGER

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Kostich.

speaker_heading: TUGGER

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Has the Pin talked about her?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Not to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Yeah, he might know something. Ask him.
dialog: Tell me what he says, cause if you heard
dialog: something, you know, I wanna check.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I found the body, Dode.

speaker_heading: DODE

speaker_heading: DODE

speaker_heading: DODE

dialog: 
text: Brendan's face is empty. Dode walks stiffly away. Brendan

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brendan pulls the newspaper off his face, lying in a fetal
text: position. Dode is nowhere to be seen.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, painfully, Brendan hoists himself up. He coughs and
text: splutters, barely able to keep his footing.
dialog: 
text: He limps across the field. Every step is agony. The wind
text: blows against him. The black field seems impossibly long,
text: still he keeps limping forward, towards the ravine.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RUNOFF TUNNEL - DAY
text: Brendan slides down the embankment, landing on his feet.
dialog: 
text: Gathered around the drain tunnel entrance are Tugger, the

text: Everyone looks at Brendan.
dialog: 
text: A long silence. Brendan clears his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What'd I miss?
dialog: 
dialog: More silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
text: Dode here says Emily Kostich is dead.
dialog: 
text: Nobody reacts to that. Brendan's face is placid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Oh yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Yeah. He says he knows who did it. He
text: says he knows where the body's at.
dialog: (beat of silence)
dialog: And he says he wants more money than I
dialog: think the information's worth.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: That so, Dode?
dialog: (to the Pin)
dialog: 
dialog: 83
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: So walk. What's the info have to do with

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: Plenty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Plenty, he says.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Uh huh. And he wants cash on the nail.
dialog: He's a pot skulled reef worm with more

dialog: dirt you can't believe?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: You'll believe this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Maybe you will.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: You'll believe it, cause it's someone
dialog: close to you. Real close.
dialog: 
text: The Pin looks up at Brendan, whose face is loose and
text: nonchalant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Maybe it's hot, but it's Dode, you can't
dialog: trust it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: Real close.
dialog: 
text: Tugger's eyes are locked on Dode, his scar the color of raw

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: PIN

speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: You had her against the wall with the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: I know my business. It's still too much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DODE
dialog: (with growing confidence)
dialog: It's not, cause that's not why she was
dialog: killed, and it's real important to you,
dialog: cause the person who killed her's real
dialog: close, and cause he's got a lot to lose,
dialog: and he knows if I don't bury him by
dialog: spilling to you I spill to the bulls and
dialog: bury him for real, and he's really
dialog: really scared - she had a kid in her and
dialog: he couldn't stand -
dialog:

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Tug, it's alright!

dialog: 
text: Tug levels the gun at Dode's head and fires one shot. The

dialog: 
text: The rapport reverberates through the black tunnel behind
text: them, and birds fly out. Dode remains upright for a moment,
text: then falls limp into the water.

dialog:

dialog: (thickly)
dialog: Tug...
dialog: 
text: Tugger fires - dirt kicks up, and the Pin scrambles back.
text: Brendan crawls towards Tug, yelling for him to stop.
dialog: 
text: Tug fires twice more, both misses, and the Pin is away.

speaker_heading: KARA

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

dialog: thinking Em had his kid, thinking I did

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Yeah, we'll talk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (to Brendan)
dialog: You going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. TUGGER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brendan lies on his back. Sweat stands on his forehead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE FAN
dialog: 
text: Spinning dizzily from Brendan's POV. Then the fan is still
text: and the room is spinning, then the fan, then the room.
text: Brendan clamps his eyes shut. A door creaks open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (croaks)
dialog: Go away.
dialog: 
text: Laura floats across the room to him. Her hair falls around
text: him. Brendan shrinks back. She puts a pale hand on his
text: clammy forehead. Brendan tries to speak, but cannot.
dialog: 
text: He fingers slide over his face. She pulls off his glasses.
dialog: 
text: Her hands all over his face. Brendan's throat contorts in a
text: hard swallow. His eyes are wet.
dialog: 
text: Her hair, her hands all warm and gentle, touching him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I'm sorry Brendan.
dialog: 
text: Brendan breaks. In silent sobs first, then shivering with an
text: almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE FAN
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Spinning above them.

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Don't go tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I've got to make sure it plays out
dialog: smooth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It'll play however it plays without you
dialog: there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I've got to make sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Cause if there's war, I'm in it too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Well let's just, I mean why not just run
dialog: away. Go somewhere. I've got a car.
text: (Brendan gives a wry look)
dialog: I've got an aunt in New Orleans, she
dialog: wouldn't care.
dialog: (Brendan grins)
dialog: Yeah, it's a stupid thing, but think
dialog: about it, why not? What, school? C'mon.
dialog: Family?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Alright, stop.
dialog: 
text: Her smoke drifts into the fan.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I wasn't serious, but we could go for
text: awhile. Just until everything clears.
dialog: 
text: Brendan watches the smoke. She stubs the butt out in an ash
text: tray on the table and curls against his chest.
dialog: 
text: Stretching his arm across the table, he nonchalantly spins
text: the ash tray around with his finger.
dialog: 
text: His glasses lay on the table. Through the left lens the
text: cigarette is magnified. Pale blue arrow on the filter.
dialog:

dialog:

text: up at the fan, spinning.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: The hell-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I'll take the scenic route to draw off

speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Mr. Smarts.
dialog:

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN

dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Alright, I warned you. Can you get the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Go to 2014 Clancy, off Pico west of La
text: Grange. Park outside and wait. Laura's

dialog: Alright?

dialog: Alright?

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PIN'S DEN - SAME
dialog: 
text: The Pin at his desk, flanked by two of his boys. Tug sits in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Talk.
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: I want full assurance that any heat from
dialog: Emily and Dode is gonna be on just you.
dialog: I don't even want my name pulled in the

dialog: come home in not too much time.
dialog: 
text: Tug's eyes burn, his scar reddens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (to Tug)
dialog: That's square. You did them after all.
dialog: Lay low it'll blow over. Stick on this,
dialog: one of you'll dish it to bury the other
dialog: and you'll both get the rap. As to the
dialog: six, did you borrow it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Then you owe it. Shouldn't need a shake

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Alright to both.

dialog:

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: PIN

dialog: 
text: Brendan looks up sharply, taken off guard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: It's yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: That aint the point. I'm gonna start
dialog: selling it. How do I know it aint bad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Why would it be?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Why was the last one? Cause someone got
dialog: greedy. Tug here's had the means to
text: swipe half and cut it bad for a long
dialog: time. Now we're splits my loss of
dialog: trust's retroactive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Did you, Tug?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: (eyes hot on the Pin)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Alright, so let's shake and blow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Not good enough.
dialog: 
text: Tug shoots to his feet, kicking away his chair.
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What would be good enough?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: I wanna see him dose it. Just to prove
dialog: it. Then we're square.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Hell for that! I didn't touch your junk,
dialog: that's it.
dialog: 
dialog: 99
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: I wanna see it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: To hell!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Your not wanting to dose it's telling me
dialog: something right here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Yeah, it better be! It's telling that
dialog: I'm out from your thumb, that I aint
dialog: playing lapdog to no gothed up cripple
dialog: no more!
dialog: 
text: Everyone in the room is on their feet. Brendan steps
dialog: forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I'll dose it.
dialog: 
text: All eyes to him, unbelieving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: If it'll shut you two apes up I'll take
dialog: the dose, and if I don't die we're all
dialog: right as rain, and if I do die you two
dialog: have your war, so long as you keep it
dialog: off my grave. Deal?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
text: Fine. Tangles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Johnny, go with him.
dialog: They go.
dialog: 
text: Tug just stares at Brendan, then tosses his hands up
text: slightly and turns away.
dialog: 
text: They all wait.
dialog: 
text: CRASH! from the next room. Everyone freezes. More breaking,
text: then scuffling and shouting.
dialog: 
text: The two punks look at their bosses, then run out. Tug starts
text: to follow, but Brendan holds him back.
dialog: 
dialog: 100
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The noise through the wall grows tremendous, a full brawl.
text: The ceiling pounds and shudders with footfalls and bodies
text: hitting the ground.
dialog: 
text: Then, from not too far away, a gunshot.
dialog: 
text: The Pin stands and goes towards the door, but Brendan shouts
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: and slams it shut. A few tense seconds.
dialog: 
text: Another gunshot. Footfalls, then Tangles falls through the
text: door, his chest red. The Pin bends over him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TANGLES
dialog: (gasping)
text: The brick, it's gone. The brick's gone.
dialog: 
text: Tangles stops gasping.
text: The Pin stands, eyes blazing at Tug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Make peace, huh? Talk it out? Get your
dialog: boys in my den soes you could snag it
dialog: under my nose?
dialog: 
text: Tug's scar is fiery red. He coils his body, snarling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Alright!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No, that's not-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Was it bad, Tug? Snag it so I don't
dialog: know, or sell it off to flat the war
dialog: odds?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Pin, think about it-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER
dialog: Alright, I did all that!
text: Tug blows past Brendan like a train and slams the Pin into
text: the ground with his fist. He punctuates his words with hard
text: straight blows into the Pin's face.
dialog: 
dialog: 101
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TUGGER (cont'd)
dialog: I cut the brick, I stole the money, I
dialog: faked a peace, I snagged your junk, I
dialog: did it all!
dialog: 
text: He pulls the gun.
dialog: 
text: Brendan shouts and throws himself on Tug's arm, wrenching it
text: sideways. The gun clunks onto the carpet.
dialog: 
text: The Pin flips Tug over and for a moment Brendan is caught
text: between them, hit and torn, rolling over the gun. Tug grabs
text: it, Brendan grabs his wrist and the gun goes off, firing
text: into the ceiling. Plaster sprays.
dialog: 
text: Brendan screams, thrashing wildly, and manages to slip out
text: of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two.
dialog: 
text: The Pin is on top, pinning Tug's gun hand to the carpet,
text: straining to keep it there.
dialog: 
text: Brendan leaps to his feet, staggers, then winds up and kicks
text: Tug in the wrist with all his strength.
dialog: 
text: A terrible crunching popping sound. Tug roars. Brendan takes
text: the gun from his limp hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN
dialog: Do him!
dialog: 
text: Brendan backs off a few steps. The Pin strains to keep Tug
dialog: down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIN (cont'd)
dialog: Do him now!
dialog: 
text: Brendan stumbles back. Tug roars, flips the Pin over and
text: beats his face mercilessly.
dialog: 
text: Brendan stumbles out into the hall.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
dialog: 
text: Empty. From the darkened doorways and the thin ceiling
text: relentless sounds of fighting.
dialog: 
text: Brendan walks backwards as if in a trance, eyes glued to the
text: Pin's door. Inside wild shadows splay across the walls, and
text: the Pin shouts Brendan's name.
text: Light flashes from another darkened doorway and the wall
text: beside Brendan splinters. Brendan spins on his heel and
text: fires three shots into the darkness, which falls silent.
dialog: 
dialog: 102
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He turns the gun back on the Pin's doorway.
dialog: 
text: With a spray of sparks the doorway turns dark. They broke
dialog: the lamp.
dialog: 
text: The dark doorway looms up before Brendan, inky black.
text: Horrible sounds come from it, blows, breaking bone, screams.
text: The Pin screams Brendan's name over and over, calling for
text: help. Pleading. Brendan steps back.
dialog: 
text: Time slows down. Brendan drops the gun.
dialog: 
text: It thunks on the carpet.
dialog: 
text: In one motion Brendan kicks the gun down the hall into the
text: Pin's doorway, turns and runs into the room where he found
dialog: the brick.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM
dialog: 
text: Dark. Brendan runs through, clawing past dark fighting
text: shapes, running like a man possessed. He breaks through the
text: darkness and heaves himself up through the small window.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF PIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brendan scrambles out, slips on the grass and hits the
text: ground hard.
dialog: 
text: Two sharp gunshots come from the house.
dialog: 
text: Everything is suddenly still. Brendan stands slowly.
dialog: 
text: He notices a light from the Mustang - the trunk has drifted
dialog: open.
dialog: 
text: Inside, a pale blue arm lies tangled in black plastic. Blue
text: fingernails. Cheap plastic bracelets.
dialog: 
text: Brendan shuts the trunk solidly, then walks off down the
text: street and vanishes into the inky night.
dialog: 
text: A moment later police cars pull up, sirens blaring, lights

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No. Stayed there till six thirty, then

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You didn't give her a ride, did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: THE BRAIN

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF GYM - LATER

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (softly)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: No?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
text: Laura looks at him strangely, a little uneasy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
text: The papers say six dead, three around
text: the house, one girl in the trunk of
text: Tug's car, and the Pin and Tug.
dialog: 
text: Brendan's face is frozen in an ambiguous frown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: LAURA
text: Tug tried to shoot his way out when the
text: police got there. They tied him to Dode,
text: too. Same gun. And the girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Well good thing you weren't there.

speaker_heading: LAURA

speaker_heading: BRENDAN

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You loved her.

speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (distant)
dialog: Yeah I did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You did all this cause you loved her.
text: And now it's finished.
dialog: (tightens her embrace)
dialog: I love you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Laura pulls back, looks at his face. It is a mask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: No, it's not finished. Tug pulled the
dialog: trigger on Em and he got the fall, but
dialog: the bulls coulda found that out without
dialog: me.
text: Laura pulls back more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN (cont'd)
dialog: I set out to know who put her in the
text: spot, who put her in front of the gun.
dialog: That was you, angel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (drifting back further)
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
dialog: 106
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: It was you. What, you want the whole
dialog: tale? You want me to tell it to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: Tell it to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Alright, from the top. You had your
dialog: fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances
text: and to keep him buying from the Pin, who
dialog: you were hooked with. Emily came to you
dialog: and Brad, you saw her for what she was,
text: an insecure little girl trying to get
text: in. She goes on the backburner.
dialog: Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored,
dialog: maybe just greedy, so when the Pin
dialog: scores big with the bricks you take your
dialog: shot. You hook one, take half, and cut
dialog: it back to size, but you cut it bad.
dialog: Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the
dialog: Pin's operation, doesn't matter. You put
text: it back, but poor Frisco doses off it
text: and lands in a coma.
dialog: (voice strengthening)
text: So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's
text: jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's
text: crowd looking for blood, or at least a
dialog: scape. You know trouble. There's going
dialog: to be a war over this. And there's
dialog: Emily. She trusts you. She wants in.
dialog: It's duck soup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (murmurs)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You frame her for the bad brick, then
dialog: you cut her loose. You turn on your heel
dialog: and bite her in the throat. Last week on
dialog: the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she
text: saw something she was scared of. Tug's
text: car driving by, the Pin driving, but she
dialog: wouldn't have seen the Pin. No, she was
text: across the street, angel. She saw the
dialog: passenger side. She saw you. She saw you
text: and ran like she saw some devil.
dialog: 
text: Laura's face is very still, quivering.
dialog: 
dialog: 107
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Brendan, why are you-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
text: And she took the hit. Dode hid her away,
text: but the Pin was on to her, tracked her
dialog: down, told her to meet him, that they
dialog: would make good. Gave her a time, and a
dialog: place. And sent Tug. Just to get the
dialog: straight. But maybe you had talked Tug
dialog: up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em
dialog: sprung it on him that she had her kid,
dialog: and he did what anyone could count on
text: Tug doing - he hit her. She took the hit
dialog: for you. You let her take it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Stop it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: That's the tale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Stop it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You're going to tell me it's not?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It's not!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: Look at me.
dialog: 
text: She crumples against him, looking him straight in the eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You know me. I've only helped you. How
dialog: can you - It isn't true!
dialog: 
text: She sobs through a tensed, straight face. Brendan holds her
text: stare, but his eyes are distant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: I hope it isn't. I want you to have been
dialog: on my side all along, not just trying to
dialog: get me under your thumb like Brad and
text: the Pin and Tug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: No-
dialog: 
dialog: 108
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: But I think you knew that meeting was
dialog: going to blow up. I think that was your
dialog: final play. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope
dialog: everything I wrote in the note I dropped
text: at Gary Trueman's office this morning is
dialog: wrong. About your and Brad's involvement
dialog: in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't
dialog: steal the brick last night. In your
dialog: purse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (breathes)
dialog: I didn't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: That's good. That means you didn't let
dialog: me walk into a slaughterhouse. You
dialog: didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their
dialog: crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman
text: reads the note, takes my cue and
dialog: searches your locker, he won't find a
dialog: damn thing.
dialog: 
text: Something changes in Laura's eyes.

scene_heading: EXT. LOCKER CAGE - INSERT

text: spins through the air, and shatters silently on the locker
dialog: cage floor.

scene_heading: EXT. BASKETBALL FIELD - SAME
dialog: 
text: A moment of silence between them. The basketball nets
text: jangle.
dialog: 
text: Laura steps back. She looks as if she has been punched in
text: the face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (murmurs)
dialog: Brendan... don't...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (gently)
dialog: It's done.
dialog: 
text: Her face does strange things, subtle contortions.
text: She watches his eyes. He doesn't look at her. Her voice
dialog: shakes.
dialog: 
dialog: 109
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Done. Well. That's most of it. 9 out of
dialog: 10. I told Em to tell Tug it was his.
dialog: Told her it would soften him up. She
dialog: said she wished she could keep it, but
dialog: she didn't love the father. I was going
dialog: to drive her down the next day, we'd
dialog: found a doctor. Most wouldn't. She was
dialog: starting to show. 3 months. You know
dialog: whose kid that makes it, or have you
dialog: known all along?
dialog: 
text: Slowly, steadily, she straightens up. Her figure takes back
text: some dignity. She steps towards him deliberately. Closer.
text: Right up against him.
dialog: 
text: She brings her head to his, puts her lips to his ear,
text: breathes warm breath, and says two words. The first is
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAURA (cont'd)
dialog: Mother-
dialog: 
text: the second is low, guttural and lost to the whistling wind.
dialog: 
text: She turns and walks briskly away.
dialog: 
text: Brendan watches her go across the dark, barren field of
dialog: asphalt.
dialog: 
text: Metal jangles. Brendan turns to see the Brain hopping a
text: chain link fence. Brendan turns his eyes back on Laura.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: You get your straight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Yeah. I wouldn't have-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: S'alright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Yeah, well. Chuck Burns came to. The
text: knife guy. Spilled it all to the bulls,
dialog: guess Brad Bramish hired him. On his
dialog: own, just a grudge thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: (nods slightly)
dialog: Fits. You did good, Brain. Go sleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Yeah, you too.

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Brain starts to walk away, but turns back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN (cont'd)
dialog: What'd she whisper to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: She called me a dirty word.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BRAIN
dialog: Alright, you don't have to tell me.
dialog: Thick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENDAN
dialog: As what-all.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field, watching
text: Laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks
text: off behind a twisted chain linked fence.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The first period bell rings, and Brendan walks back
text: towards campus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
