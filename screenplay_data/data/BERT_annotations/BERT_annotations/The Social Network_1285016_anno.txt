text: FROM THE BLACK WE HEAR--
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: Did you know there are more people with
dialog: genius IQ's living in China than there
dialog: are people of any kind living in the
dialog: United States?
speaker_heading: ERICA (V.O. )
dialog: That can't be true.
speaker_heading: MARK (V.O.)
dialog: it is true.
speaker_heading: ERICA (V.O.)
dialog: What would account for that?
speaker_heading: MARK (V.0.)
dialog: Well first of all, a lot of people live
dialog: in China. But here's my question:
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT
text: MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of
dialog: any physically intimidating attributes masks a very
text: complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye
dialog: contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you
dialog: or to himself.
text: ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face
text: that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the
text: conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there
text: and her politeness is about to be tested.
text: The scene is stark and simple.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: How do you distinguish yourself in a
dialog: population of people who all got 1600 on
dialog: their SAT's?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I didn't know they take SAT's in China.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I wasn't talking about China anymore, I
dialog: was talking about here.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You got 1600?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You can sing in an a Capella group.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: BRICA
dialog: Does that mean that you actually got
dialog: nothing wrong?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar
dialog: PC.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Or you get into a final club.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Or you get into a final club, exactly.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I like guys who row crew.
speaker_heading: MARK
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Well I can't do that. And yes, it means I
dialog: got nothing wrong on the test.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Have you ever tried?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm trying now.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: To row crew?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: To get into a final club. To row crew?
dialog: No. Are you, like--whatever--crazy?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Sometimes, Mark-seriously-YOU say two
dialog: things at once and I'm not sure which one
dialog: we're talking about.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: But you've seen guys who row crew, right?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Okay, well.. they're bigger than me.
dialog: They're world class athletes. And a
dialog: second ago you said you like guys who row
dialog: crew so I assumed you'd met one.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I guess I meant I liked the idea of it.
dialog: The way a girl likes cowboys.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The Phoenix is good.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: This is a new topic?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's the same topic.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: We're still talking about the finals
dialog: clubs?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Would you rather talk about something
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: It's just that since the beginning of
dialog: the conversation about finals clubs I
dialog: think I may have had a birthday.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: We can change the subject.
speaker_heading: ERICA.
dialog: (can't get over it)
dialog: There are more people in China with genius
dialog: IQ's than the entire population of--
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It's about exclusivity.
speaker_heading: T'RICA
dialog: .....what is?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The final clubs. And that's how you
dialog: distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the
dialog: most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt
dialog: punched the Porc.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best
dialog: of the best.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I actually meant which Roosevelt.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Theodore.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Okay, well, which is the easiest one to
dialog: get into?
text: MARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag
text: and blows the smoke out before he says...
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Hm.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: why would you ask me that?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I was just asking.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: They're all hard to get into. My friend
dialog: Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil
dialog: futures last summer and he won't get in.
dialog: Money or the ability to make it doesn't
dialog: impress anybody around here. Everybody
dialog: can do that.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: He made $300,000 in a summer?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He likes meteorology.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You said it was oil futures.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: If you can predict the weather you can
dialog: predict the price of heating oil. You
dialog: asked me that because you think the final
dialog: club that's easiest to get into is the
dialog: one where I'll have the best chance,
speaker_heading: ERICA
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I've lost my place again.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You asked me which one was the easiest to
dialog: get into because you think that's where I
dialog: have the best chance.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: The one that's easiest to get into would
dialog: be the one where anybody had the best
dialog: chance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: S.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I just think you asked--the placement of
dialog: where you asked the question--
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was
dialog: asking just to ask. Mark, I'm not
text: speaking in code.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Erica--
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You're obsessed with the finals clubs.
dialog: You have finals clubs OCD and you need to
dialog: see someone about this who'll prescribe
dialog: some sort of medication. You don't care
dialog: if side effects may include blindness,
dialog: okay, just do it.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there's
dialog: a difference between being obsessed and
dialog: being motivated.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yes there is.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do
dialog: speak in code.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I didn't mean to be cryptic.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm saving I need to do something
dialog: substantial in order to get the attention
dialog: of the clubs.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Because they're exclusive.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And fun and they lead to a better life.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected
dialog: president because he was a member of the
dialog: Phoenix Club?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: He was a member of the Porcellian and yes
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Maybe he sang in an a Capella group.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I want to be straight forward and tell
dialog: you that I think you should be a lot more
dialog: supportive. If I get in I'll be taking
dialog: you to the parties and you'll be meeting
dialog: people that you wouldn't normally get to
dialog: meet.
speaker_heading: ERICA
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: You would do that for me?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're my girlfriend.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: okay, well I want to be straight forward
dialog: and tell you that I'm not anymore.
speaker_heading: MARK
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm not your girlfriend anymore,
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Is this a joke?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No, I'm sorry, it's not.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're breaking up with me?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: You're going to introduce me to people I
dialog: wouldn't normally get to meet? What the
dialog: fuck is that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Take it easy.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What was it supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: It was--Erica, the reason we're able to
dialog: sit here and drink is that you used to
dialog: sleep with the door guy.
speaker_heading: ERICA
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I want to really try not to lose it now.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

dialog:

speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: The door guy's name is Bobby. I haven't
dialog: slept with the door guy, the door guy's a
dialog: friend of mine. He's a perfectly good
dialog: class of people and what part of Long

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I apologize, okay? Siddown.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm going back to my dorm, I have to

speaker_heading: MARK
speaker_heading: ERICA---
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I'm sorry and I mean it..
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I appreciate that but--
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: ---I have to study.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You don't have to study. Let's just talk.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I can't..
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Because it's exhausting. Going out with
dialog: you is like dating a stairmaster.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: S.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: All I meant is that you go to B.U. and so
dialog: you're not likely to--I wasn't making a
dialog: comment on your parents--I was saying you
dialog: go to B.U.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I have to go study.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You don't have to study.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: How do you know I don't have to study?!
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Because you go to B.U.!
text: ERICA stares at him...
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Do you want to get some food?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm sorry you're not sufficiently
dialog: impressed with my education.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: And I'm sorry T don't have a rowboat.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I think we should just be friends.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I don't need friends.
speaker_heading: ERICA OF
dialog: I was being polite, I had no intention
dialog: being friends with you.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You're really leaving.
text: ERICA takes MARK's hand and looks at him tenderly..
speaker_heading: ERICA
speaker_heading: (CLOSE)
dialog: Listen, You're going to be successful and
dialog: rich. But you're going to go through life
dialog: thinking that girls don't like you
dialog: because you're a tech geek. And I want
dialog: you to know, from the bottom of my heart,
dialog: that that won't be true. It'll be because

speaker_heading: EDUARDO
dialog: Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on

dialog: anything. With Facemash he'd beaten the

text: MARK kind of nods a little to himself. It should be noted that

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: SEAN

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY
speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I went to check my e-mail and there's a

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah. After you went unconscious last

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: 'iheFacebook? It. started at Harvard and
dialog: standford's had it for about two weeks
dialog: and it's awesome except it's addictive.
dialog: Seriously, I'm on the thing five times a

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: You mind if I grab a piece of paper and a

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: CAMERON

speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Good morning, s_ir. I'm Cameron Winklevoss

speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: Why are you here?
text: There's silence while SUMMERS appears to read over the

speaker_heading: SUMMERS (CONT'D)
dialog: That wasn't rhetorical.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I'm sorry, I thought you were reading the
dialog: letter.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: I've read the letter.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Well I think it's pretty self-
dialog: explanatory. We had an idea for a website
dialog: called HarvardConnection--we've since
dialog: changed the name to ConnectU--and Mark
dialog: Zuckerberg stole that idea and--
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: What do you want me to do about it?
text: CAMERON points to a row of Harvard Student Handbooks on the
text: bookshelf behind SUMMERS.
speaker_heading: CAMERON V
dialog: Well sir, in The Harvard Student
dialog: Handbook, which is distributed to each
dialog: freshman--under the heading "Standards of
dialog: Conduct in the Harvard Community" and the
dialog: sub-heading, "Honesty"--
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: Oh dear God.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: --it says, "The College expects that all
dialog: students will be honest and forthcoming
dialog: in their dealings with members of this
dialog: community. All students are required to
dialog: respect private and public ownership.
dialog: Instances of theft, misappropriation or
dialog: unauthorized use of or damage to property

speaker_heading: CAMERON
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: --will result in disciplinary action,

dialog: the handbook.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: When did you memorize that?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (a little frustrated with this
speaker_heading: BULLSHIT)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: TYLER (CONY ' D )
dialog: Sir, it's against University rules to
text: steal. from another student, plain and
dialog: simple.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: You've spoken to your R,A.?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Yes sir, and the R.A. made a
dialog: recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad
dialog: Board won't hear us.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: Have you tried dealing with Mr.
dialog: Zuck.e.rberg directly?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
text: Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't responded to any of
dialog: our e-mails or phone calls for. the last'
dialog: two weeks. He doesn't answer when we
text: knock on his door at Kirkland and the
dialog: closest we've come to talking face to
text: face is when I saw him on. the quad and
text: chased him through Harvard Square.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: You chased him?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I saw him and I know he saw me and I
text: started after him and he disappeared
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: You know he could have you arrested for
text: harassment and attempted assault.
speaker_heading: TYLER
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: This isn't happening.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: I don't see this as a University issue.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Of course it's a University issue.
dialog: There's a code of ethics and an honor
dialog: code and he violated them both.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: You entered into a code of ethics with
text: the university, not with each other.
speaker_heading: TYLER
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm sorry President Summers, what you
dialog: just said makes no sense to me at all.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: I'm devastated by that.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: What my brother means is that if Mark
text: Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and
dialog: stole our computer it would be a
dialog: university issue, right?
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: I really don't know. This office doesn't
dialog: handle petty larceny and the only reason
dialog: I agreed to see you--Anne; by did I
dialog: agree to see them?
speaker_heading: ANNE
text: Colleagues of their father.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: So you see?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This isn't a petty larceny.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
speaker_heading: (CALMING)
speaker_heading: TY--
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This idea is potentially worth millions
dialog: of dollars.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: Millions of dollars?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: You might be letting your imagination run
dialog: away with you.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: With all due respect I don't think you're
dialog: in any position to make that call.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: I was U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in
dialog: some position to make that call.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Letting our imaginations run away with us
dialog: is exactly what we were told to do in
dialog: your freshmen address.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: Well. I would try letting your-
dialog: imaginations run away with you on a new
dialog: project.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You would.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: Everyone at Harvard is inventing
dialog: something or starting a new business in
dialog: their dorm room- Harvard undergraduates
dialog: believe that inventing a job is better
dialog: than getting one so can I suggest again
dialog: that the two of you come up with a new
dialog: new project?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I'm sorry, but that-'s not the point, sir.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: What's the point?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You don't have to be an intellectual
dialog: property expert to understand-the,
dialog: difference between right and wrong.
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: And you're saying that I don't?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Of course I'm not saying that.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I'm saying that.
text: SUMMERS looks at TYLER and then smiles...
speaker_heading: TYLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Just start another project? Like we're
dialog: making a diorama for the science fair?
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: Yes. And if you have a goddam problem
dialog: with that, Mr. Winklevoss, the courts are
dialog: always at your disposal. Athletes don't
dialog: get special treatment at this school.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Do they get fairness?
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: They don't get to run to daddy. Okay?
dialog: This isn't 50 years ago.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96,
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Excuse me, sir, but in your analogy, is
dialog: daddy our father or you?
speaker_heading: SUMMERS
dialog: Both. Is there anything else I can do for
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: TYLER-

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in

speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: The company's here. A billion dollar

dialog: that in New York, Eduardo introduced
dialog: himself as the business head of Facebook.
dialog: I've been at the front of two of the

dialog: Henley, England--founded in 1179.
text: And after a moment of placid quiet--
speaker_heading: ---BOOSHI
text: Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for
text: the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and
dialog: prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.
text: The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The
text: port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the
text: Ilollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a
text: pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the "H" of
dialog: Harvard.
text: We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing
text: section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot
text: -- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n
text: blazers and brightly colored floral ties.
text: But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just
text: their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural.
text: straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half
dialog: torture test against the best competition they've ever faced.
text: And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the
dialog: Dutch.
text: The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of
dialog: them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late.
text: Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving
text: the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of
dialog: Americans.
dialog: 
dialog:

text: We'll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and latex
dialog: we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next
text: to him is their mother, who can barely watch.
text: Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice
text: through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and
text: there's still no daylight between them.
text: We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin
text: to stream down his arm.
text: 25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--
text: even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups
dialog: the closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'ï¿½
text: is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed--
text: the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.
text: The blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted
text: by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig,
dialog: and pull, and pull, and pull, and---
dialog: POP!
text: --the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of
text: the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.
text: CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch
text: group holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The
text: Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.
text: The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug
text: as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.

dialog: The next transformative development? A
dialog: picture sharing application. A place
dialog: where you view pictures that coincide
dialog: with your social life. It is the
dialog: true... digitalization of real life. You
dialog: don't just go to a party anymore, you go
dialog: to a party with your digital camera and
dialog: your friends relive the party on
dialog: Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you
dialog: could tag anyone you wanted in those

speaker_heading: ASHLEIGH
dialog: Why has the music stopped?
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I've spent hours watching what people do
dialog: when they log on.
speaker_heading: ASHLEIGH
dialog: Seriously, why has the music stopped?
text: ASHLEIGH has a point. The music stopped in the addle of
text: SEAN's speech and the sound outside from the party just
dialog: doesn't sound like a party anymore.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: flow they always checked their friends'
dialog: status updates, checked to see which of
dialog: their friends had changed their profiles,
dialog: changed their photos and mostly...We

text: SEAN walks out of the room to the--
scene_heading: INT, STAIRCASE LANDING - CONTINUOUS
text: And out the window he sees a fleet of police cars with their
text: lights flashing parked in front of the house. Then before he
text: can react, the front door flies open--
text: POLICE with flashlights walk in--the beams of light streaking
text: across the darkened party floor and the faces..
text: We HEAR muffled murmurs from the cops of "party's over" and

dialog: We've got kind of a celebration going.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Ladies, I need you to put your shirts on.
speaker_heading: SEAN
dialog: I can have them turn the music down.
text: One of the policemen casually takes SEAN's hand and sees that
text: his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard. The
text: cop uses his finger to taste what it is.
speaker_heading: SEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, that isn't mine.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Okay, could you all stay where you are.
text: And the handcuffs start to come out and we've got a room of
