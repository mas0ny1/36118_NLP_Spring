scene_heading: INT. ED’S DRIVE-IN - KITCHEN —- DAY
text: The kitchen of a drive-in restaurant outside St. Louis. It’s
text: 1954. Traveling salesman RAY KROC (52) stands before a sample
text: MIXING MACHINE, making his pitch to the OWNER.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Now, I know what you’re thinking:
dialog: “What the heck do I need a five-
dialog: spindle for? I barely sell enough
dialog: shakes to justify my single
dialog: spindle.” Right? Wrong.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Mr. Paulsen, are you familiar with
dialog: the notion of the chicken and the
dialog: egg? I mention it because I believe
dialog: it’s applicable here: Do you not
dialog: need a Multimixer because you're
dialog: not selling enough milk shakes? Or
dialog: are you not selling enough milk
dialog: shakes because you don’t have a
dialog: Multimixer? I firmly believe it’s
dialog: the latter. You see, your
dialog: customers, they know that if they
dialog: order a shake from your
dialog: establishment, it’s going to be a
dialog: terrific wait. They’ve ordered one
dialog: before, and by golly they’re not
dialog: gonna make that mistake again. But
dialog: if you had, say, a Prince Castle-
dialog: brand five-spindle Multimixer with
dialog: patented direct-drive electric
dialog: motor, you could greatly increase
dialog: your ability to produce delicious,
text: frosty milk shakes fast. And before
dialog: long, mark my words, dollars to
dialog: donuts, you'd be selling more of
dialog: those suckers than you can shake a
dialog: stick at. Increase supply, demand
dialog: will follow. Chicken and the egg.
dialog: You follow my logic? Of course you
dialog: do. You’re a bright, forward-
dialog: thinking fella who knows a good
text: idea when he hears it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So whaddaya say?
text: ON THE OWNER-- pondering thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Nah.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Thanks anyway.
scene_heading: EXT. ED’S DRIVE-IN - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Kroc lugs the heavy Mulitmixer back to his car. He lifts it
text: into the trunk, wincing from his bad back.
scene_heading: INT. KROC’S CAR —- MOMENTS LATER
text: Kroc sits in his car checking his APPOINTMENT BOOK. His next
scene_heading: sales call: DEE DEE’S DRIVE-IN - 1 P.M.
text: He checks his watch. It’s 12:05. He turns on the car, pulls
text: into a customer spot in front of Ed’s Drive-In.
text: He looks at the MENU BOARD, taking in the vast, seemingly
text: random assortment of items: BBQ beef sandwiches, hot tamales,
dialog: peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, chili dogs, etc.
scene_heading: INT. KROC’S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Kroc sits in his car, waiting for his food. He looks at his
text: watch. It’s 12:50. He lets out a heaving, exasperated sigh.
text: KROC’S POV, the view out his windshield: a rowdy TEEN-HANGOUT
text: SCENE. Rock-and-roll blasting from cars; female CARHOPS on
text: rollerskates dodging grabby male patrons; leather-jacketed,
text: cigarette-smoking hoodlums smacking each other around.
text: Kroc is the oldest customer by a mile--and seemingly the only
text: one with anywhere to be. He HONKS his horn, summoning his
text: CARHOP. She comes skating over holding a tray of Cokes.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Miss, how much longer?
speaker_heading: CARHOP GIRL
dialog: Should be any minute.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You said that 20 minutes ago.
speaker_heading: CARHOP GIRL
dialog: I’m sorry, we're real--
text: She JUMPS-SQUEALS, startled. The tray of Cokes goes flying
text: into the car, SPILLING ALL OVER KROC’S LAP. Several glasses
text: and plates fall on the ground, SHATTERING.
text: Carhop Girl spins around, sees a GUY behind her cracking up.
text: He just pinched her butt.
speaker_heading: CARHOP
dialog: Dennis!
dialog: (re: Kroc, soaked)
dialog: Look what you made me do!
speaker_heading: DENNIS
dialog: Sorry, gramps.
text: Dennis scampers off toward his pack of laughing friends. The
text: carhop goes chasing after him, mad but not actually mad.
text: ON KROC-- looking down at the pool of bubbly brown liquid in
text: his lap. He HONKS, leans out the window.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Could I get some napkins?
text: No one hears him.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: ANGLE ON the pants drying on the shower’s curtain rod.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (0.S.)
dialog: It’s going great.
text: CUT TO: the NEXT ROOM. Kroc sitting on the bed, on the phone.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Lot of good leads today. Real
text: strong leads.
text: Through the phone, a tiny passive-aggressive sigh.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: (prickly)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC (0.S.)
dialog: Nothing. That's wonderful.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: There’s tremendous interest.
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC (0.S.)
dialog: I’m sure there is.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You don’t believe me?
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC (0.S.)
dialog: Of course, Ray. Why wouldn’t I?
scene_heading: SHORT TIME LATER--
text: Kroc sits on the edge of the bed, roiling from the call. He
text: takes off his shirt, undressing for bed. His bare torso bears
dialog: numerous surgery scars: heart, gall bladder, etc.
text: He reaches over to the night stand, grabs a fifth of Canadian
text: Club. Unscrews the cap.
scene_heading: SHORT TIME LATER--
text: Kroc, in pajamas, stands before a PORTABLE PHONOGRAPH. He
text: drops the needle on a record.
scene_heading: SHORT TIME LATER--
text: Kroc lies in bed in the darkened room, eyes closed. A
text: soothing baritone fills the air--
speaker_heading: RECORD (0.S.)
dialog: Nothing in the world can take the

dialog: not; nothing is more common than

scene_heading: INT. JOE'S DRIVE-IN - KITCHEN - NEXT DAY
text: The kitchen of another drive-in, Kroc pitching to the OWNER.
text: The scene is virtually identical to the previous day’s.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Increase supply, demand will
dialog: follow. Chicken and the egg. You
dialog: follow my logic? Of course you do.
dialog: You're a bright, forward-thinking
dialog: fella who knows a good idea when he

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So whaddaya say?
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Kroc lugs the sample Multimixer back to his car.
scene_heading: INT. KROC’S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Kroc is pulled up to a customer spot in front of Joe’s Drive-
text: In. The scene before him is very much like the one at Ed’s
text: Drive-In, a riot of teenage rowdiness.
text: He looks at his watch. It’s 12:45. He HONKS, shouting out to
dialog: no one in particular:
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Could someone tell me when my...
text: He trails off as a female CARHOP approaches with a tray. She
text: hooks the tray onto his car door.
speaker_heading: CARHOP
dialog: Enjoy.
text: She heads off. He lifts the cover off his plate, primed to
text: dig in. His face falls at the sight of the hamburger beneath.
text: He leans out the window, honks.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I ordered the barbecued beef!
text: He’s howling into the void.
scene_heading: EXT. MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - LATER
text: Another drive-in. Kroc with the OWNER.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Mr. Merriman, are you familiar with
dialog: the notion of the chicken and the--
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: No, thank you.
text: The Owner disappears into the restaurant. Kroc, shut down,
text: lugs the Multimixer over to his nearby car, heaves it into
text: the trunk. He takes a swig from his FLASK.
scene_heading: EXT. MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kroc at a pay phone, dialing a long-distance number.
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO (0.S.)
dialog: Prince Castle, how may I help you?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Hi, June.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES —- CONTINUOUS
text: A modest office in a Chicago high-rise. At the reception desk
dialog: is secretary JUNE MARTINO. (Intercut as necessary.)
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO
dialog: Ray. How’s it going down there?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Fine, swell, lot of interest.
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO
dialog: That’s terrific. Hold on, I'1l
dialog: fetch your messages.
text: She grabs a pile of messages off the desk.
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO (CONT’D)
dialog: Let’s see: Gene Rafferty from
dialog: United Aluminum, says he needs to
dialog: reschedule Friday... Ed Nance
dialog: calling again about the refund... a
dialog: lady from March of Dimes about a
dialog: donation... oh, and we got an
dialog: order. Six.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Six?
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO
text: Some drive-in out in California.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: One place? That’s impossible.
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO
dialog: I’ve got the slip right here.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You must've misunderstood. Give me
dialog: the number, I'll straighten it out.
scene_heading: EXT. MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - SHORT TIME LATER-—
text: Kroc pours a few nickels into the pay phone, dials a number
text: off his wrist.
speaker_heading: YOUNG EMPLOYEE (0.S.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Good afternoon. May I please speak
dialog: to the owner?
speaker_heading: YOUNG EMPLOYEE (0.S.)
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: YOUNG EMPLOYEE (0.S.)
dialog: Dick or Mac?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Um, whomever’s available.
text: The guy puts the phone down, heads off. Through the receiver,
text: Kroc hears the sounds of an insanely busy--and efficient--
text: kitchen. “Order up!”... “I need six fries!"”... “Patties up!”
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (0.S.)
dialog: This is Dick.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Hello Dick, this is Ray Kroc from
dialog: Prince Castle Sales. I’m phoning
dialog: because someone there placed an
dialog: order with us for some Multimixers.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Yes, yes, that was me. How soon can
dialog: you get ‘em out here?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Well, that’s actually why I was
dialog: calling. I believe there may have
dialog: been a miscommunication between--
text: In the background, someone SHOUTS SOMETHING to Dick.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Freezer! Top shelf, left side!
dialog: (back to Kroc)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: My secretary’s under the impression
dialog: you wanted six.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: You know what? I think that’s a
dialog: mistake.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: That’s what I figured. What kind of
dialog: drive-in would be making 30 shakes
dialog: at a--
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Better make it eight.
text: ON KROC-- flabbergasted. Another background SHOUT.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
dialog: What’s that, Al? There’s a brand-
dialog: new box in the storeroom!
dialog: (to Kroc)
dialog: Look, now isn’t the best time.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I’m sorry, I’m still a bit--
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: You know where to send ‘em, right?
dialog: San Bernardino, California. Corner
dialog: of 14th and E.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: To anyone in particular?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Just the store is fine. McDonald's.
text: Another BACKGROUND SHOUT distracts Dick.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
dialog: I gotta go. Just get those mixers
dialog: out here ASAP, okay? Thanks!
text: Click. Kroc stares at the receiver. What the hell was that?
scene_heading: EXT. MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kroc stands over a U.S. ROAD MAP on the hood of his car. He
text: unfolds it, opening the map westward. (Note: This part of the
text: map is not well-worn like the Midwest; it’s virgin territory
dialog: for Kroc.)
text: Kroc’s eyes drift westward to California. They land on a
dialog: small town 60 miles east of Los Angeles: San Bernardino.
text: Kroc looks at the whole country. He notices something. A road
text: directly connecting St. Louis to San Bernardino. Route 66.
text: ON KROC-- staring at Route 66. A single, unbroken line
text: running from where he is now to that mysterious city out in
dialog: Southern California.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 66 - DAY
text: Kroc driving west on Route 66. Cars, the open road, a
text: limitless horizon. The sky, the country, the whole world
text: seems to open up. His heart swells with possibility. The
text: vastness excites his brain. This must be how Lewis & Clark
dialog: felt. And then...
scene_heading: EXT. SAN BERNARDINO CITY LIMITS - ROUTE 66 - DAY
text: Kroc arrives in San Bernardino. A drab, dusty little town on
text: the edge of the desert. Hardly the pot of gold at the end of
text: the rainbow he was expecting. He continues along Route 66,
text: heading toward the center of town.
scene_heading: SHORT TIME LATER--
text: Kroc driving. He sees the line before he sees the restaurant.
text: A long line, hundreds of people, snaking toward a HAMBURGER
text: STAND in the distance.
text: ON KROC-- taking in the strange sight of people out of their
text: cars, queued up in a line leading toward a self-service
text: window. It’s a distinctly FAMILY CROWD, lots of parents with
text: their children. Not a teenage delinquent in sight.
text: He parks, gets out. Unsure what to do, he gets in the line.
text: He looks off at the restaurant, checks his watch. It’s 1:15.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t worry. It moves fast.
text: ANGLE ON the WOMAN in front of him. No sooner does she say
text: this than the line moves. Kroc shuffles forward 10 feet.
scene_heading: SHORT TIME LATER--
text: Kroc in line, significantly further along. He looks at his
text: watch. It’s 1:19.
scene_heading: EXT. MCDONALD'S - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Kroc at the front of the line. He checks his watch. 1:23.
speaker_heading: CASHIER (0.S.)
dialog: Welcome to McDonald’s, may I take
dialog: your order?
dialog: 11.
text: Kroc looks up, sees a CASHIER looking at him with a friendly
text: smile. Like all the other cashiers, he’s male and wholesome
dialog: as apple pie.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Um, yes...
text: He looks at the MENU BOARD. It has just FOUR ITEMS: burgers,
text: fries, shakes, and Coca-Cola. A radical departure from the
text: typical sprawling drive-in menu.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
text: Hamburger, fries, and a Coca-Cola.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: 45 cents, please.
text: Kroc hands him two quarters.
speaker_heading: CASHIER (CONT'D)
dialog: And five cents is your change.
text: Kroc barely has time to put the nickel away when--
speaker_heading: CASHIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Here you are.
text: The cashier hands him a paper sack. Kroc looks at it with
dialog: confusion.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Your food.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I just ordered.
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: (shrugs, smiles)
dialog: And now it’s here.
text: Kroc peers into the bag. Lo and behold, inside is a burger,
text: fries, and a Coca-Cola. He sees it’s all wrapped in PAPER.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: ("Where are the”--)
dialog: Silverware? Plates?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: You just eat it straight out of the
dialog: wrapper. Then throw it all out.
dialog: 12.
text: ON KROC-- bewildered. He takes the bag, unsure what to do.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: So now I bring it back to my car?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: Most folks do. Or you could eat it
dialog: in the park, at home... anywhere
dialog: you like.
text: Kroc nods. This is all so strange to him. He turns, heads
text: toward his car. On the way, he spots an EMPTY BENCH. He
text: impulsively takes a seat.
text: Kroc reaches into the bag in his lap. He takes out the
text: hamburger, noting the paper packaging. He unwraps the burger,
text: looking at it, sniffing it. It looks and smells wonderful.
text: As he’s about to take a bite, out the corner of his eye he
text: notices in a nearby car... a GORGEOUS BLONDE.
text: KROC’S POV: The blonde, biting into a hamburger. As she
text: chews, a look of ecstasy comes over her face. She closes her
text: eyes, her head tipping back a bit, borderline orgasmic.
text: ON KROC-- staring at the blonde.
speaker_heading: MOTHER (0.S.)
dialog: May we?
text: Kroc is shaken out of his reverie by a FAMILY OF FOUR looking
text: to sit on the bench. He slides over, making room.
speaker_heading: MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Kroc’s attention shifts from the blonde to the family. He
text: discretely watches as the mother passes out burgers to her
text: two young kids. The kids bite into them, “mmm”-ing audibly.
dialog: ON KROC-- observing this family of four, wholesome as can be,
text: devouring their delicious McDonald's hamburgers.
text: Kroc looks at the burger in his own hand, takes a bite. As he
text: chews, his eyes roll back in his head.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: How is everything?
text: Kroc looks up, sees a MAN standing before him. His necktie
dialog: and demeanor suggest manager.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: This is the best burger I ever had.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: We aim to please.
text: The man smiles, extends a friendly hand.
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mac McDonald.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Ray Kroc.
text: They shake. Kroc pulls a BUSINESS CARD from a pocket, hands
text: it to him. McDonald looks at it, unsure what to make of it:
scene_heading: RAY KROC - PRINCE CASTLE SALES CORP. - 2310 WACKER DRIVE,
speaker_heading: CHICAGO, ILL.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: The Multimixer fella.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: (it clicks in--)
dialog: You spoke to my brother.
text: Mac looks again at the card, noting the Chicago address.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: What brings you way out here?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Oh, I was just in Los Angeles.
dialog: Meetings. Business. Figured as long
dialog: as I was in the neighborhood, I'd
dialog: swing by, say hello.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Well, I’m glad you did. Welcome!
text: Kroc’s eyes drift to the busy, humming restaurant.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Quite an operation you got here.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Care for a little tour?
dialog: There’s nothing Kroc would like more.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER
text: A bustling kitchen, organized as a series of stations.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (0.S.)
dialog: Speed...
text: ON MAC-- leading Kroc through the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s the name of the game.
text: They come to a massive GRILL manned by THREE COOKS.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: First stop for every McDonald's
text: hamburger is the grill, manned by
dialog: three cooks whose sole job is to
dialog: grill those all-beef beauties to
dialog: perfection.
text: Kroc watches the mouth-watering beef sizzling on the grill.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Meanwhile...
text: He leads Kroc to an adjacent station, where two DRESSERS
text: stand before a rotating Lazy Susan with 24 BUN TOPS on it.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
text: As the patty cooks, our “dressers”
dialog: get the bun ready.
text: DRESSER #1 puts pickle slices and onion on each bun--
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Every McDonald’s hamburger gets two
dialog: pickles, a pinch of onion...
text: --while DRESSER #2 applies a squirt of ketchup and mustard
text: with a pair of trigger-operated CONDIMENT GUNS.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
text: ..-and a precise shot of ketchup
dialog: and mustard.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (re: condiment guns)
dialog: Where'd you get those things?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: We made ‘em.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Made them?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Custom built. Whole kitchen is.
dialog: 15.
text: ON KROC-- utterly amazed.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: (resuming tour)
text: Next it’s off to the finishing
dialog: station...
text: ANGLE ON the Lazy Susan, carrying 24 fully dressed bun tops,
text: traveling along a belt toward a FINISHING STATION.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Where it all comes together.
text: A pair of FINISHERS put cooked patties onto the fully dressed
text: bun tops, then put on bun bottoms and neatly wrap it up.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Voila!
text: The finished product is fed into an angled metal sleeve that
text: slides them to the front counter, where cashiers can grab and
dialog: bag them with ease.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
text: A fresh and delicious hamburger,
text: grill to counter in 30 seconds.
text: ON KROC-- dumbfounded by what he’s seen. He looks at Mac.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Did I come up with all of this?
dialog: (sly smile)
dialog: I didn’t.
text: Kroc is confused.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: We did.
text: Kroc follows Mac’s eyes to a MAN coming toward them.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Dick McDonald. My brother.
text: Kroc grabs Dick’s hand, enthusiastically shakes.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I just have to say, what you’ve
dialog: done here is nothing short of--
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: (to Mac, ignoring Ray)
text: The fries.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: What about ‘em?
text: Dick leads Mac toward the FRENCH FRY STATION. Kroc follows
text: along. Dick plucks a fry off the drying rack, hands it to
text: Mac, who pops it in his mouth.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Perfect.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: They're five percent too crisp.
text: Dick takes a fry, tastes it. Frowns.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
dialog: I think we should drop to two
dialog: minutes, 50 seconds.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: That's what you had it at before.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: 400, not 375. Higher temp, shorter
dialog: cook.
text: Mac takes another taste.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: I really think they’re spot-on.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (to Dick)
dialog: If it makes any difference, they're
dialog: the best fries I’ve ever tasted.
text: Crispy golden brown on the outside,
text: fluffy on the inside. Not too oily,
text: perfectly salty and crunchy.
text: Dick looks at Ray, taking note of him for the first time.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: This is that Multimixer fella you
dialog: spoke to.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Ray Kroc, Prince Castle Sales.
dialog: 17.
text: Kroc hands Dick his card. Dick gives it a cursory glance.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: How soon you figure we can expect
dialog: ‘em?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I’m sending them Blue Label Air.
dialog: You should have it early next week.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Good.
text: With this, Dick abruptly walks off. Ray gives chase.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Wait!
text: He catches up, grabs Dick’s arm.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Let me take you out to dinner.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: (jokey)
dialog: You're really not my type.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You and your brother.
text: Mac, a few feet away, comes over, curious.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I’m gonna shoot straight with you
dialog: fellas. This restaurant is the most
dialog: remarkable thing I’ve seen in all
dialog: my years in the food-service
dialog: industry. And believe you me, I've
dialog: seen it all. I want to know
dialog: everything about it. Where it came
dialog: from, how you thought of it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Please. Tell me your story.
scene_heading: INT. STEAKHOUSE - EVENING
text: Kroc sits across from the brothers in a corner booth, rib eye

speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: There wasn’t a job in all of

dialog: So we packed our bags and headed

dialog: in the movie business. And Dick,
dialog: well, he wanted to be...
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Employed.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: We landed jobs driving trucks for
dialog: Columbia Pictures. After a few
dialog: years, we had enough saved up to
dialog: buy our own little piece of show
dialog: business. A little movie theater
dialog: out in Glendora. Which would've
dialog: been swell, except for the small
dialog: matter of timing. It was September
dialog: of ‘29. One minute we’re screening
dialog: “Gold Diggers Of Broadway”, the
dialog: next it’s “Brother, can you spare a
dialog: dime?” Literally.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I couldn't.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Nobody in town was making any
dialog: money. Except this one fella, Wylie
dialog: Reid. Ran a hot dog and root beer
dialog: stand. People still gotta eat,
dialog: right? So we decide to set up our
dialog: own stand, hot dogs and orange
text: juice, out in Arcadia.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCADIA - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: A YOUNG DICK AND MAC manning their dusty, roadside HOT DOG
text: STAND during the Great Depression. A smattering of CUSTOMERS.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: It did okay, enough to keep us off
dialog: the bread line, but we were hardly
dialog: doing gangbusters. There just
dialog: weren’t enough people in Arcadia.
dialog: 19.
scene_heading: BACK TO PRESENT--
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
text: Meanwhile, one town over is San
dialog: Bernardino, the place is growing at
dialog: a terrific clip. We want to
dialog: relocate, but we’ve got no money
dialog: for a new stand. That’s when my
dialog: brother here gets one of his
dialog: brilliant ideas. Tell him, Dick.
dialog: Dick throws Mac a “That’s okay, you tell him” nod.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: “Why don’t we move the stand we’ve
dialog: got? Put it on a truck!”
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Genius, right? Except one small
dialog: problem. On the road between the
dialog: towns, there’s an overpass. The
dialog: building doesn’t clear. I figure
dialog: that’s it, we’re done for. But then
dialog: Dick says...
text: Another nod of deferral from Dick.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: “Why don’t we saw the restaurant in
dialog: half?”
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Dick and Mac driving an old flatbed Ford. On the back is the
text: stand, SPLIT IN TWO. The truck goes under an overpass,
text: narrowly clearing.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: We truck the darn thing over in two
dialog: pieces, put it back together!
scene_heading: BACK TO PRESENT-—
text: Kroc guffaws with amazement.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
text: We move the building, set up shop.
dialog: But before we open, we decide to
dialog: give the place a little tweak. It’s
dialog: 1940. Drive-ins are all the rage,
dialog: the hottest thing going. I say
dialog: Dick, we gotta get in on this. Dick
dialog: says sure.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Two months later, we open for
dialog: business...
dialog: (show-biz hands)
dialog: “McDonald’s Famous Barbecue!”
scene_heading: EXT. MCDONALD'S FAMOUS BARBECUE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: The brothers’ proto-McDonald’s, up and running. Pretty
text: CARHOPS in tasseled short skirts and Western boots hustle
dialog: about serving customers.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: We've got a 27-item menu, barbecue
text: slow-cooked in a real pit out back.
text: Uniformed waitresses bring the food
dialog: straight out to your car. It does
dialog: gangbusters. Going great guns. But
text: then, sales start to level off.
scene_heading: BACK TO PRESENT--
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: The drive-in model, as we learn,
dialog: has a few built-in problems.
text: Kroc leans in, eager to hear their take on this.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
dialog: For starters, there’s the customer
dialog: issue. Drive-ins tend to attract,
dialog: shall we say, a less-than desirable
dialog: clientele.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Teenagers.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Hot rodders and hooligans. Juvenile
text: delinquents in blue jeans.
text: Kroc nods, all too familiar.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
dialog: Then there’s the service. It takes
dialog: forever and a day for your food to
text: arrive. And when it finally does--
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: It’s completely wrong.
text: Kroc nods.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
text: The carhops are too busy dodging
dialog: gropes to remember you wanted a
dialog: strawberry phosphate, not cherry.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: If they remember at all.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Then there’s the expenses. Payroll
dialog: is high due to the large staff
dialog: required. Dishes are constantly
dialog: getting stolen or broken.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
text: Tremendous overhead.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
text: But one day Dick has a realization.
text: Going over the books, he notices
dialog: something. The bulk of our sales
dialog: come from just three items:
text: Burgers, fries, soft drinks.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: 87 percent.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: We say to ourselves, what the heck
dialog: are we doing monkeying around with
dialog: all this other stuff? Focus on what
dialog: sells.
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: And that’s just what we do.
text: Brisket, gone. Tamales, gone. And
text: we don’t stop at the menu. We look
dialog: at everything. What else don’t we
dialog: need?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Turns out, quite a lot.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Carhops.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Walk up to a window. Get your food
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Dishes.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: All paper packaging. Disposable.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
text: Jukeboxes, cigarette machines.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Drive out the riff-raff.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (totally in sync)
dialog: Create a family-friendly
dialog: environment!
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: And finally, the biggest, most
dialog: important cut of all... the wait.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Orders ready in 30 seconds, not 30
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
text: We decide to tear down the kitchen.
dialog: Rebuild. Reconfigure. Rethink the
dialog: whole dang thing. And you're gonna
dialog: love how we do it. Tell him, Dick.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: The tennis court?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: He brings me out to this tennis
text: court, draws an outline in the
dialog: dirt. Exact dimensions of our
dialog: kitchen.
scene_heading: EXT. TENNIS COURT - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: A TENNIS COURT, somewhere in San Bernardino. Mac watches as
text: Dick carefully draws a KITCHEN OUTLINE on it with a stick.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: We bring in a bunch of employees,
dialog: have ‘em go through the motions,
text: making pretend burgers and fries.
text: --An invisible kitchen, YOUNG EMPLOYEES mimicking the moves,
dialog: trying to get it right.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
text: Dick’s chasing after them with the
dialog: stick, marking up where all the
dialog: equipment should go. They do it
text: over and over, hashing out the
text: moves, choreographing like it’s
text: some sort of crazy burger ballet.
text: --Over and over. It’s starting to get dark.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: Finally, after about six hours of
dialog: this, we get it just right.
text: --Workers making pretend burgers and fries in perfect sync.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
text: A symphony of efficiency. Not a
dialog: wasted motion.
scene_heading: BACK TO PRESENT--
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: We take the layout to a builder,
dialog: custom build to exact specs.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
text: Ta-da. The Speedee System is born.
dialog: The world’s first-ever system
dialog: designed to deliver food fast. It's
dialog: totally revolutionary.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: And a complete disaster.
scene_heading: EXT. MCDONALD'S - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: The grand opening. The hungry and the curious pulling up.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
text: Opening day, people pull into the
text: lot, immediately start honking when
text: no carhop comes over. We try to
dialog: explain the walk-up window. They're
text: bewildered. Furious. “Whaddaya mean
dialog: I gotta get out of my car?”
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: BACK TO PRESENT--
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Most of them just cuss us out and
dialog: drive off. The few that stick
dialog: around are mad as heck about having
dialog: to eat off paper and discard their
dialog: own trash.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: We may have underestimated the
dialog: learning curve.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
text: By five o'clock, Dick’s calculating
dialog: the cost of converting back to
dialog: drive-in. But me, I’m not quite
text: ready to throw in the towel. Going
dialog: back to my Hollywood roots, I say
dialog: to myself, “We gotta go big with
dialog: this. We gotta put on a show.” I
dialog: tell Dick I want to throw a grand
text: re-opening. A gala premiere to put
dialog: Louis B. Mayer to shame.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRAND RE-OPENING - EVENING (FLASHBACK)
text: The fast-food equivalent of a Hollywood-style premiere.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: We rent a bunch of spotlights, the
dialog: same ones we used to truck around
dialog: to premieres in the Columbia days.
dialog: I get sparklers, a juggler for the
dialog: kiddies--it’s an event. People show
dialog: up in droves. And then...
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
text: The flies.
text: --An ominous cloud gathers over the restaurant. A SWARM OF
text: INSECTS. They swoop down in unison, as if in attack mode.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: They must've been drawn by all the
dialog: lights.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: Millions of ‘em. Looked like
dialog: something out of Exodus.
text: --Customers running, screaming. Swatting.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: The Pharaoh would’ve released the
dialog: Israelites.
scene_heading: BACK TO PRESENT--
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: It’s a total disaster. Towel time.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: The next morning, Dick and I meet
dialog: up to discuss going back to the old
dialog: format. As we're talking, there’s a
text: knock at the service window. Dick
text: goes over, sees a little boy
text: standing there. He wants a bag of
text: burgers.
scene_heading: INT. MCDONALD'S - DAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Dick at the service window, looking at a YOUNG KID. His nose
text: barely clears the counter.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: I tell him we're closed.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: But he’s cute, I feel bad for him,
dialog: so I fire up the grill, make hima
text: batch. And as he’s heading off...
text: --A car pulls into the lot.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.0.)
text: A car pulls up.
dialog: --A second car.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: Then another.
text: --A third car.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: And another. Before you know it,
text: there’s a line around the block.
text: --A LINE OF CUSTOMERS stretching into the distance.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (V.O.)
dialog: Word has spread.
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: BACK TO PRESENT--
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
text: And it’s off to the races.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: We’re an overnight sensation.
dialog: Thirty years in the making.
text: ON KROC-- absorbing all of this, blown away.
text: Mac gives Kroc a modest little shrug.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: So that’s our story.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kroc lies awake in bed, buzzing, unable to sleep.
scene_heading: EXT. MCDONALD'S - NEXT MORNING
text: Dick and Mac pull into the McDonald’s lot in Dick’s car.
dialog: They’re startled to see--
text: Kroc, sitting out front. He approaches their car. Before Dick
text: can fully roll down his window:
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Franchise.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Beg pardon?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Franchise, franchise the thing.
dialog: It’s too good to just be one
dialog: location. There ought to be
dialog: McDonald's everywhere. Coast to
dialog: coast, sea to shining sea. And I’m
dialog: just the man to help you do it.
dialog: I’ve spent the better part of my
dialog: life criss-crossing this country. I
dialog: know every highway and byway, every
dialog: city and every town.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Mr. Kroc...
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Let me just say one thing. One more
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to confess something to you
dialog: boys. I’m not out here in
dialog: California on any business meeting.
dialog: I’m out here for you. You’re what
dialog: brought me out. A few days ago, I
text: was standing outside a filling
dialog: station in St. Louis, Missouri
text: staring at a U.S. road map, staring
text: at a long, white, unbroken line
dialog: called Route 66. I took my finger--
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Mr. Kroc-—
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I took my finger, and I traced that
dialog: line from where I was standing all
dialog: the way out to California, where it
dialog: ran smack-dab into this place we
text: are now. As I stared at that line,
dialog: something told me to follow it.
dialog: Something told me to get in my car
dialog: and see what’s out there at the
dialog: other end. And when I laid eyes on
dialog: your hamburger stand yesterday, all
dialog: those people lined up to purchase
dialog: your remarkable product, I knew it
dialog: was-—-
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: We already tried!
scene_heading: INT. MCDONALD'S - BACK OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Kroc and the brothers stand before a U.S. MAP.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Five.
text: ANGLE ON map. Five PUSH PINS are stuck in it, clustered
dialog: around California and the Southwest.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
dialog: Three in Southern California, one
dialog: in Sacramento and one in Phoenix.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And that’s all there’1ll ever be.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Why?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Two words: Quality control. It’s
dialog: almost impossible to enforce
text: standards from afar.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Those places were a mess. Filthy
dialog: kitchens, inconsistent menus...
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Sacramento was selling burritos.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: To watch your precious creation get
dialog: mismanaged like that. Your name.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
text: Put Mac in the hospital.
text: Kroc looks at Mac, surprised.
dialog: A BEAT as
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Diabetes and extreme stress don’t
dialog: mix.
text: Kroc absorbs this.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: But if you had somebody in charge
dialog: of supervising.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: We did.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: He obviously didn’t do a great job.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: So replace him. With someone
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Our energies are better spent
dialog: making this place the best it can
dialog: possibly be.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Better one great restaurant than 50
dialog: mediocre ones.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Sure, but I still think if you had
dialog: the right--
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Thank you, we’re not interested.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Someone as committed to quality as--
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Thank you.
text: Kroc backs off. A BEAT of awkward silence.
text: Kroc’s eye goes to something else on the wall... a BLUEPRINT.
text: The building has towering arches on each side.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
text: A blueprint.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Those:
text: Mac follows Kroc’s eyes to the arches.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: It’s a way to make the place stand
dialog: out when you’re driving past.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: “The Golden Arches” I call ‘em.
text: Kroc stares at them, fascinated. It’s a crazy, radical (and
dialog: kind of brilliant) thing to stick on the sides of a building.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Who thought of that?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: That’s pure Dick magic right there.
text: Dick’s gaze is still on the arches, clearly proud.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Ever do one like that?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Just one...
dialog: 30.
text: Dick looks at the U.S. map. A lonely push pin in the middle
dialog: of Arizona.

dialog: Phoenix.
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 66 - SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA/ARIZONA -— DAY
text: Kroc driving back along Route 66, taking in the scenery.
text: SERIES OF SHOTS: Kroc passing through various small towns,
text: each with a Main Street running through it. On every Main
text: Street, we see the same two things: a church and courthouse.
text: Glimpses of various churches and courthouses. Churches topped
text: with crosses. Courthouses with American flags.
text: ON KROC-- processing, wheels turning.
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 66 - FLAGSTAFF, AZ - NIGHT
text: Kroc driving through Flagstaff. He passes a road sign: I-17
scene_heading: SOUTH - PHOENIX - NEXT RIGHT
text: He takes an impulsive detour.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL AVENUE (PHOENIX) - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Kroc drives down Phoenix’s Central Avenue. He sees the arches
text: before he sees the restaurant.
text: Kroc pulls into the empty lot (the restaurant is closed). He
text: gets out, looks up at the arches. They’re lit up and glowing.
dialog: Glorious, magical.
text: He does a slow lap around the building, taking in the arches
text: from all angles. Halfway around, the shifting perspective
text: causes the arches to meet. They form a giant “M” (the
text: McDonald's logo as we know it today), 30 feet high.
text: ON KROC-- standing before the “M”, bathed in its golden,
text: glowing light. Like Moses before the Burning Bush.
scene_heading: EXT. KROC’S HOUSE (DES PLAINES, IL) - DAY

speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC

speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: Ray...
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Just hear me out.
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: I’m too old for this.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: I can’t do it. Not again.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Don’t you want to be a part of

speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: All our friends are taking trips,

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Ethel, this place--
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: It’s revolutionary.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (bristles at her sarcasm)
dialog: As a matter of fact...
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: It’s never going to get any better,
dialog: Ray. We’re never going to have

dialog: now. And that’s okay.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: What’s not okay is us wasting our

dialog: we're never going to grab.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (flash of anger)
dialog: Maybe if I had a wife who had an
dialog: ounce of vision. Who gave me an
dialog: ounce of support.
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: Support? Support?
dialog: her off--
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: All I’ve done is support you! I’ve
dialog: had your back through thick and
dialog: thin, through one cockamamie idea
text: after another. The wax cups, the
text: Fold-A-Nook, the Multi-Mixer, on
dialog: and on, every last one. And you
dialog: have the nerve to say I don’t
dialog: support you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (backing off, chastened)
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: I’ve believed in you, Ray. Our

dialog: would've.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You're right.

speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: That drive back home on 66, I

dialog: of each one of them was a Main
dialog: Street. And on each of those Main
dialog: Streets were always the same two

text: The brothers look at each other, unsure where this is going.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: As I drove along, I pondered those

text: He goes over to the blueprint, plants a finger on the arches.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Now, forgive me if this flirts with
dialog: blasphemy, but to my mind, these
dialog: arches share a great deal in common
dialog: with the Christian cross and the
text: American flag. A building topped
text: with a cross is a gathering place.
dialog: A place where decent, wholesome
dialog: folks can come together and be with
dialog: others who share their values. The
dialog: same can be said of a building
dialog: flanked by a pair of your arches.
dialog: Those arches mean more than simply
text: “delicious hamburgers inside”. They
dialog: signify family. Community. The ties
dialog: that bind. They represent goodness,
dialog: togetherness, a place for Americans
dialog: to gather and break bread.
dialog: McDonald’s can be that, too. The
dialog: new American church, feeding bodies
dialog: and feeding souls. And not just on
dialog: Sundays. Seven days a week.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
text: Crosses. Flags. Arches.
text: ON MAC-- blown away. He looks over at Dick, expecting a

speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD

scene_heading: INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: It’s your dream, Dick.
dialog: (eye contact)
dialog: Bigger than your dream. Arches--
dialog: your arches--coast to coast.
text: Dick’s eyes go to the U.S. map. A whole country, just waiting
text: to be filled in with push pins.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I can’t put you through that again.
text: ON MAC-- looking at Dick gazing longingly at the map.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: I know how bad you want this. You

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Last time, you very nearly wound
dialog: up—
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: We'll do it different this time.
dialog: Learn from our mistakes.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: We keep a much tighter leash. Total
dialog: oversight, every change has to go
dialog: through us.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Who says he’s gonna listen?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: We draw up a contract. Lay it out,
text: clear as day in black and white.
text: ON DICK-- pondering. Seemingly warming to the idea.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Whaddaya say?
scene_heading: INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Ray Kroc sits across a table from the brothers and their
text: LAWYER. Kroc is skimming through a BIG FAT CONTRACT. Full of

scene_heading: MCDONALD FRANCHISE, EITHER PHYSICAL OR CONCEPTUAL, MUST BE
text: FORMALLY SUBMITTED IN WRITING FOR APPROVAL BY BOTH RICHARD
scene_heading: MCDONALD AND MAURICE MCDONALD...
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (0.S.)
dialog: Fine.
dialog: 38.
text: Kroc has a rushed air about him, eager to get to the dotted
text: line. He continues skimming. A glimpse of another page:
scene_heading: ...KROC SHALL RECEIVE ONE AND NINE-TENTHS PERCENT (1.9%) OF
scene_heading: NET PROFITS GENERATED BY FRANCHISEE(S), WITH ONE-HALF OF ONE
scene_heading: PERCENT (0.5%) OF SAID NET PROFITS PAID TO RICHARD MCDONALD
scene_heading: AND MAURICE MCDONALD...
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine.
scene_heading: SHORT TIME LATER--
text: Three copies of the contract are laid out before Kroc, open
text: to the last page. The brothers’ lawyer slides him a fountain
text: pen. He readily signs in triplicate.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (PRE-LAP)
dialog: We are a dynamic, fast-growing

scene_heading: INT. MIDWAY SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY (ONE MONTH LATER)
text: Kroc, dressed in his best suit and tie, sits across from a
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: And now, we’re poised to make major
dialog: inroads nationally.
text: The loan officer looks at a set of BLUEPRINTS on his desk
scene_heading: titled MCDONALD'S #6 - DES PLAINES, ILL.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: In addition to giving us a foothold
dialog: in the Midwest, the Des Plaines
dialog: location will serve as a lure for
dialog: prospective franchisees.
text: The loan officer looks over the blueprint. Something catches
dialog: his eye.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: What are those?
text: Kroc follows his gaze to the arches. He smiles proudly.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Oh, that’s just my little way of
dialog: separating us from the pack. “The
dialog: Golden Arches”, I call ‘em.
dialog: 39.
text: The loan officer picks up a bound prospectus prepared by
dialog: Kroc. Artist renderings, projected earnings, etc.
text: ON KROC-- anxiously watching as he leafs through it.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: (filling the air)
dialog: There’s nothing like it in the
dialog: entire food-service sector.
text: The loan officer looks up from the materials.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: You look familiar. Have we met?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (a drop uneasy)
dialog: I don’t believe so.
text: ON LOAN OFFICER, staring, determined to place the face. He
dialog: snaps his fingers--
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: The Fold-A-Nook!

speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER #2

speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER #2 (CONT’D)
text: The paper-cup guy.
text: ON KROC-- silent a long beat.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (embarrassed, broken)
dialog: Among many other things.
text: The loan officer stares at Kroc, taking in his vulnerable,
text: Willy Loman-esque visage. A wave of compassion/pity comes
text: over him.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER #2
dialog: I tell you what. Let me refer you
dialog: to one of my colleagues. Somebody
dialog: who may be better suited to meet
dialog: your needs.
scene_heading: A FEW DESKS DOWN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kroc sits before a different LOAN OFFICER. The man is filling
text: out an APPLICATION FORM for Kroc.
speaker_heading: LOAN OFFICER
dialog: Address?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: 143 Juniper Road, Arlington
dialog: Heights, Illinois.
text: ANGLE ON the form as the man fills in Kroc’s address. It’s a

scene_heading: is HARVEY PELTZ - HOME MORTGAGE REPRESENTATIVE.
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: Home telephone number?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Let me give you my office number.

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO
dialog: I just spoke to Dick. He says

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Working on it?
text: He lets out a heaving, irritated sigh.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s been a week.
scene_heading: INT. MCDONALD'S (SAN BERNARDINO) - OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

speaker_heading: RAY KROC (0.S.)

scene_heading: INT. KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: (Intercut as necessary.)
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What’s the hold up? I break ground
dialog: in two weeks.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: These things take time. You're
dialog: proposing substantial alterations.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I’m adding a basement and furnace.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: We need our architect to thoroughly
dialog: review it to make sure everything's
dialog: safe and up to code.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Has he looked at it yet?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I’m not sure, to be honest.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I can’t afford to let this drag.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Ray, you need to take a breath. It
dialog: hasn’t even been a week.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I’ve got bulldozers rolling up on
dialog: the 23rd.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I’m not the one who scheduled that.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Do you have any idea what it’d cost
dialog: me to push?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Hopefully, it won’t come to that.
speaker_heading: ON KROC--
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Every restaurant in the Midwest has
text: a basement and a furnace. This is
dialog: standard stuff.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I understand. But you have to
dialog: understand, it’s our name on that
dialog: building. God forbid the floor
dialog: caves in and people get hurt or
dialog: worse because of some design flaw
dialog: we missed, we’re the ones on the
dialog: hook. So let’s just slow down a
dialog: minute and make sure it’s done the

text: pondering Dick’s words of reason.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: So much for the Speedee System!

scene_heading: SHORT TIME LATER--

speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Then what did he say?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
text: He slammed down the phone.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: He hung up on you?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Unless we got violently

dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Can we bring that out another foot?
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO (0.S.)
dialog: Sir?
text: June comes over to Kroc with a letter. He looks at it, sees

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Read it.
text: She opens the letter, reads aloud--
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO
dialog: “Dear Ray, Thank you for your
dialog: letter sharing your idea to strike
dialog: a deal with Coca-Cola to sponsor
dialog: menu boards at the new Des Plaines
dialog: location. An intriguing notion,
dialog: indeed. As you rightly point out,
dialog: such an arrangement would provide a

text: On the other end is Mac in the kitchen, his brother nearby.
dialog: (Intercut as necessary.)
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I’m sorry, Ray, but we’re just not
dialog: comfortable with the notion of
dialog: turning our menu into an
dialog: advertisement.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Not an ad. Sponsorship.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: It’s distasteful.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: It’s free money.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: There are plenty of things we could
dialog: do to make a quick buck, but that
dialog: doesn’t mean we should.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Loads of restaurants do it.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Well, we don’t.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Because I have no interest in
dialog: indulging in that sort of crass
dialog: commercialism. It’s not McDonald's.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I didn’t realize I was partnering
text: up with a beatnik.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I happen to be a card-carrying
dialog: Republican.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You coulda fooled me!
text: He slams down the phone. Again.
scene_heading: SHORT TIME LATER--
text: Mac and Dick, post-call.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: He’s just a little... excitable.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: A hothead like that, you don’t know
dialog: what he’s capable of.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: It’s all bluster, Dick. His bark is
dialog: worse than his bite.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD

text: The brand-new Des Plaines McDonald's, up and running.
text: TRACKING SHOT, high-energy, as Kroc moves through the KITCHEN
text: barking out orders to his charges. It’s a bit militaristic in
dialog: vibe, echoing Dick’s Hitler reference:
dialog: “Watch those fries!”... “Straighten that hat!”... “Buns to
text: the left, pickles to the right!”... “Let’s go, boys!”
text: He passes an EMPLOYEE, catching him in a moment of repose--
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Grab a mop! If there’s time to
dialog: lean, there’s time to clean!
text: Tracking shot ends at the GRILL, manned by a trio of GRILLERS
text: overseeing dozens of patties. Kroc moves down the line:
text: GRILLER #1, flipping a patty--
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: More wrist!
text: Kroc grabs the spatula, demonstrates proper form. He moves
text: onto GRILLER #2, who’s lifting a patty off the grill--
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s still pink!
text: Kroc puts the patty back onto the grill. He moves on to
speaker_heading: GRILLER #3--
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: What the heck are you--
text: Kroc trails off, realizing Griller #3 is doing NOTHING WRONG.
text: His patties are perfect, arranged in rows so precise they
text: could have been lined up with a ruler.
text: ON KROC-- taking in the eager young buck, who looks maybe 21.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: What’s your name?

speaker_heading: GRILLER #3
dialog: Fred Turner, sir.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: FRED TURNER

scene_heading: EXT. MCDONALD'S - NIGHT (AFTER HOURS)
text: Under the glow of the arches, Kroc scours the parking lot,

scene_heading: INT. KROC’S HOUSE - LATER
text: Ethel is asleep in bed. Kroc enters, home from another long

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I’m sorry.

scene_heading: SHORT TIME LATER--

scene_heading: ON ETHEL AND THE WOMEN-—
speaker_heading: CLUB WIFE #1

speaker_heading: CLUB WIFE #2

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Anyone interested in hearing about

speaker_heading: JACK HORFORD (0.S.)

dialog: Here we go again...
text: ON HORFORD-- smiling at Kroc, a bit condescendingly.
speaker_heading: JACK HORFORD (CONT’D)
dialog: What is it this time, Ray?
text: ON ETHEL-- taking in the way Horford looks at her husband. It

speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: Hear him out.
text: Ethel looks at Ray, looks back at Horford.
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: This is different.

dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: JACK HORFORD

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: MYRA ROSENBLATT (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s normally ten and under, but

speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
dialog: (resuming-- )
dialog: In fact, I'd say there’s sufficient

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: A second location?
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: And come to think of it, I can

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (gamely playing along)
dialog: You don’t say.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH

dialog: (sees Kroc not listening)
dialog: Mr. Kroc?

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (caught off guard)

speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH

speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO
dialog: Well...
text: She runs her finger down a column of figures.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO
dialog: Your revenue. The monthly cut of

dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: That’s it?
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO
dialog: 1.4 percent of net.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: 1.4?
speaker_heading: JUNE MARTINO
dialog: 1.9, minus Dick and Mac’s half
dialog: percent.
text: She seems way more familiar with the terms than he does.
scene_heading: SHORT TIME LATER--

scene_heading: INT. KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Kroc paces, contract in hand. (Intercut as necessary.)
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: My deal. My lousy deal.
text: Dick looks totally taken aback.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: 1.4 is barely enough to cover my

dialog: expansion.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Ray, those are the terms.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: It’s not enough.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: It’s more than triple our cut.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Then you oughta be getting more,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I’m not a greedy man.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: It’s not about greed, it’s about
dialog: taking care of ourselves so we can

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I have no beef with the current

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I've been busting my hump for you

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: And you're doing a bang-up job.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Then I ought to be doing better
text: than just breaking even.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I don’t know what to say.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Say you'll renegotiate.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I can’t.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Can't or won’t?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Upping your cut, it wouldn’t be
dialog: fair to the franchisees.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: The franchisees are doing just
dialog: fine. I’m the one drowning. Between
dialog: your molasses approval process and
dialog: the meager cut...
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: You freely and willingly agreed to
dialog: the terms of your deal, Ray. Nobody
dialog: put a gun to your head.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: How long are you going to keep this
dialog: up, Mac?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Keep what up?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD

speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: I just wanted...
text: His face grows flushed. Dick sees something is off.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Mac.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: I’m sorry, Dickie...
text: ON DICK-- recognizing what this is.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn’t mean to leave the gate
dialog: open...
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Take a seat.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: I didn’t mean to let Boomer get
dialog: out...
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: (moving toward brother)
dialog: Mac, you're having one of your--
text: CRASH. Mac flops over, crashing to the floor.
scene_heading: SAN BERNARDINO - KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Mac is sitting on the floor nursing a milkshake. Next to him
text: is a tin box marked GLUCAGON EMERGENCY KIT.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
text: A few more sips.
text: Mac takes a sip of the shake. His sleeves are rolled up,
text: revealing a MEDIC ALERT BRACELET. Engraved on it is DIABETES
speaker_heading: TYPE 1.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: I’m okay.
text: ON DICK-- looking at his brother with love and worry.
dialog: 74.
text: ON MAC-- gazing off at something...
text: The Multimixer on the counter. Kroc’s machine, used to make
text: the shake in his hands.
scene_heading: INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Kroc sits at his desk. Next to a bottle of Canadian Club is a
text: pile of BILLS AND INVOICES. He picks one up. It’s from
text: ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL, stamped PAST DUE. He picks up another
text: one. From CHICAGO GAS & ELECTRIC. He stares at the amount
dialog: owed.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Ninety-four dollars?
scene_heading: INT. MCDONALD'S (DES PLAINES) - COOLER - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Kroc in the walk-in cooler with Fred Turner. In Kroc’s hand
dialog: is the Chicago Gas & Electric bill.
speaker_heading: FRED TURNER
dialog: It’s unbelievable what these
dialog: suckers cost to run.
text: Kroc shakes his head, a knot in his stomach.
speaker_heading: FRED TURNER (CONT'D)
dialog: My pop used to own an ice-cream
text: parlor. He went belly-up from the
dialog: refrigeration costs.
text: Kroc’s eye drifts to the left side of the cooler. The entire
text: side is filled with drums of ice cream (for the milkshakes).
text: ON KROC-- staring at the drums.
scene_heading: INT. KROC’S HOUSE - ENTRANCE/LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Kroc enters the house. He hangs up his coat and makes a
text: beeline for the liquor cabinet, pours himself a stiff drink.
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC (0.S.)
dialog: A man called today.
text: Kroc turns, startled to see Ethel in a recliner in a corner
text: of the darkened room.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Ethel.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
text: From a bank.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Alright...
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: Illinois First Federal.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What did they want?
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: You don’t know?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Why would I?
text: She gives him an unnerving stare.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ETHEL KROC
dialog: Ray...
dialog: (eye contact)
dialog: Did you mortgage our home?
text: ON KROC-- a deer in the headlights.
scene_heading: INT. ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - DAY
text: Kroc marches through the bank to Harvey Peltz’s desk.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I specifically said the office is
dialog: the best place to reach me!
text: ON PELTZ-- taken aback by the intrusion.
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: I tried you there, Mr. Kroc.
dialog: Numerous times.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You have no right to call me at my
text: home. It is a blatant invasion of
dialog: privacy.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: With all due respect, sir, when
dialog: you're three months behind on your
dialog: payments, you don’t get to pick and
dialog: choose where you’re contacted.
scene_heading: INT. KROC’S CAR - DAY
text: Kroc driving along a highway. A sign appears ahead:
scene_heading: MINNEAPOLIS - 377 MILES
scene_heading: EXT. MCDONALD'S (ROLLIE SMITH) - NIGHT
text: Kroc approaches a gleaming new McDonald’s in downtown
text: Minneapolis. He looks through a window, into the store.
text: ON KROC-- gazing.
text: KROC’S POV: Joan Smith in a McDonald’s apron, looking just
text: adorable. Pretty much his fantasy image of a woman.
text: Out the corner of her eye, she sees Kroc through the glass.
text: She heads out to him.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: Ray?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (jokey) .
dialog: Surprise inspection!
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Just thought I’d fly up, see how
dialog: things are going.
text: She smiles, impressed. It makes him feel great.
scene_heading: INT. ROLLIE’S STEAKHOUSE - LATER
text: Kroc having dinner with Rollie and Joan.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: $12,400.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: That’s some haul for month one.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: And once we clear start-up costs...
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You'll be looking at a tidy little
dialog: profit.
text: Rollie and Joan nod, buzzing over the prospect.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: Speaking of which: I hate to mix
dialog: business with pleasure...
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (wry)
dialog: I don’t.
text: Everyone chuckles. Rollie proceeds.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: My expenses...
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What about ‘em?
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: Well, they’re a bit higher than
dialog: anticipated. One in particular...
dialog: That dang walk-in.
text: ON KROC-- interested to hear more.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
dialog: The bill’s a real whopper.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: All that ice cream.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: It’s a real problem.
text: A BUSBOY comes by, clears their finished plates.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: Now, I don’t want to overstep my
dialog: bounds here, but I think I may have
dialog: found a solution.
dialog: (looks at Joan, proud)
dialog: Joan did, actually.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You don’t say.
text: Kroc turns to Joan, all ears.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: (salesman-like)
dialog: What if I told you there was a way
dialog: to save you, us, and all your owner-
dialog: operators literally hundreds of
dialog: dollars a year in electrical costs?
text: Kroc cocks an intrigued eyebrow.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
dialog: And free up valuable storage space.
dialog: And reduce the amount of time it
text: takes to make a milkshake by half.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I'll bite.
text: She reaches under the table, pulls out her purse. She takes
text: out a copy of RESTAURANT BUSINESS MONTHLY, slides it to Kroc.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: Page 22.
text: Kroc opens the trade publication to page 22. A FULL-PAGE AD
text: for something called INST-A-MIX. The ad copy trumpets:
scene_heading: ATTENTION RESTAURANT OPERATORS! INTRODUCING INST-A-MIX, THE
scene_heading: MIRACULOUS INSTANT ICE-CREAM SUBSTITUTE THAT WILL SAVE YOU
text: ‘SCOOPFULS’ OF TIME AND MONEY!
scene_heading: GREATER VOLUME! HIGHER PROFITS! MAKES REFRIGERATION A THING
dialog: OF THE PAST!
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
text: A powdered milkshake. Costs a
dialog: fraction of ice cream, no
dialog: refrigeration necessary.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: Thickening agents and emulsifiers
dialog: simulate the texture of milk fat.
dialog: Tastes just like the real thing.
speaker_heading: JOAN KROC
dialog: And it’s easy as pie to prepare.
dialog: Just pour the convenient single-
text: serving packet into water and stir.
dialog: 79.
text: ON KROC-- staring at the ad poker-faced. Rollie and Joan
text: can’t get a read on his reaction.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: I realize it may seem a tad
dialog: blasphemous, what with your dairy-
dialog: sector background and all.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: But personally...
text: Joan looks at Kroc, touches his hand.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
dialog: I think it’s a marvelous idea.
text: ON KROC-- privately quivering at the touch.
speaker_heading: WAITER (0.S.)
dialog: Could I interest anyone in dessert?
text: The WAITER holds out a dessert menu to the table.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: No thanks, Vic.
dialog: (to Kroc, cryptic smile)
dialog: We brought our own.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER--
text: ANGLE ON a pair of SILVER-FOIL PACKETS in front of Joan.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: Chocolate or vanilla?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Vanilla.
text: Joan takes one of the packets, marked “V”, dumps the powdery
text: contents into a glass. She pours in some water, stirs.
text: ON KROC-- watching with fascination as it thickens. Within
text: seconds, it transforms into what looks like a vanilla shake.
text: Joan slides it to Kroc. All eyes on him as he takes a sip. A
text: long, anxious BEAT from the table.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I think... I’m drinking a delicious
dialog: vanilla shake!
dialog: 80.
text: The table erupts in happy, relieved laughter.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: May I?
text: Kroc follows her eyes to the shake. He gives her a “be my
text: guest” nod. She raises the glass to her lips, takes a long,
text: languorous sip. Kroc watches, highly turned on.
text: She puts the glass down, smiles at Kroc.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH (CONT’D)
dialog: I couldn’t resist.
text: Kroc’s gaze drifts to the glass. On the rim is a bright-red
text: LIPSTICK MARK. He stares at it.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH (0.S.)
dialog: So whaddaya say?
text: Kroc looks at Rollie, shaken out of his moment.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH (CONT’D)
dialog: We try it out at our place. Then,
dialog: if it goes well...
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: You roll it out nationally.
text: ON KROC-- suddenly a tad queasy, thinking of the brothers. He
text: nods vaguely.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I could.
text: A strange, shaky BEAT.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Let me think about it.
text: Rollie and Joan nod, surprised. They were expecting a big,
dialog: unreserved yes.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: Of course. You’re the boss.
text: Kroc nods, privately churning. If they only knew.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Kroc is sitting on the bed looking at the Inst-A-Mix ad in
text: “Restaurant Business Monthly”. On the nightstand is a pint of
text: Four Roses bourbon, empty. He dials the phone.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Just hear me out.
scene_heading: INT. MCDONALD'S (SAN BERNARDINO) - NIGHT
text: The restaurant is closed. Dick is on the front-counter phone.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: (instantly wary)
dialog: Hello, Ray.
text: ON MAC-- cleaning up in the background. His ears prick up.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What if I told you there was a way
dialog: to save you, me, and all our owner-
dialog: operators literally hundreds of
dialog: dollars a year in electrical costs?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: And what would that be?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
text: Two words: Powdered milkshake.
dialog: (before Dick can reply--)
dialog: There’s a remarkable new product I
dialog: recently came across called Inst-A-
dialog: Mix. It’s a powdered milkshake,
dialog: costs a fraction of ice cream, no
dialog: refrigeration necessary.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Ray--
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I tried it, and let me tell you, it
dialog: is delicious. Tastes just like the
dialog: real thing.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Is this some sort of joke?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Comes in vanilla or chocolate.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Me, I’m a vanilla man.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I have no interest in a milkshake
dialog: that contains no milk.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You won’t be able to tell the
dialog: difference. Guarantee.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Why don’t we put sawdust in the
dialog: hamburgers while we’re at it?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I’m being serious.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Frozen french fries!
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You don’t want to save a bundle?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Not like that.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: We're talking the same great taste
dialog: while boosting your bottom line.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: It’s called a milk shake, Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Not to mention freeing up all that
dialog: cooler space. I don’t know about
dialog: you, but I'd sure like to--
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Milk. Now and forever.
text: ON KROC-- shut down. Yet again.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Well, thanks for giving it your
dialog: full and sincere consideration.
dialog: (fed up)
dialog: As always.
scene_heading: MOTEL ROOM —- SHORT TIME LATER
text: Kroc silently gazes off. He FLINGS THE MAGAZINE across the
text: room, knocking over a lamp.
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Kroc stares at the ever-growing mountain of bills on his
text: desk. His gaze drifts to a letter from ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL
text: marked FINAL NOTICE.
scene_heading: INT. ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - DAY
text: Kroc is sitting with Harvey Peltz, his home-mortgage officer.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You've got to extend my line.
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: Until you build more equity in your
dialog: home or pay down the loan...
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: My business is booming.
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
text: Unfortunately, that’s immaterial.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Thirteen locations in nine states!
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: It’s a home-equity loan.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Then give me a business loan.
text: REVEAL, on the other side of a partition: a patrician, silver-
text: haired BUSINESSMAN sitting across from an empty chair,
text: listening in as he waits for his banker to return.
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: These 13 locations. They’re yours?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: You own them?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I mean, not in the strict sense.
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: So then what are your assets?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Mine personally?
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: It is your business, correct? You
dialog: own it?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Not technically, per se.
text: The businessman cringes for the poor, floundering schlub on
text: the other side of the partition.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m the head of franchising. I’m
dialog: the one behind all the growth.
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: That’s all well and good, but--
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Have you ever been to a McDonald's?
text: The name catches the businessman’s ear.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: We've got three stores right here
dialog: in the Chicagoland area. Perhaps if
dialog: you swung by, took a look.
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: That's quite alright.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I'd be happy to give you a tour,
dialog: give you a better sense of--
speaker_heading: HARVEY PELTZ
dialog: Thank you. I’ve got the gist.
scene_heading: EXT. ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kroc exits the bank in defeat. He slumps off toward his car.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Mr. Kroc.
text: Kroc turns, sees the man approaching. Kroc looks him over.
text: Dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, he has the finished,
text: cosmopolitan air of a New Yorker.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: No. But perhaps I can help you.
dialog: 85.
text: He hands Kroc a business card. Kroc looks at it:
scene_heading: HARRY J. SONNEBORN - VICE-PRESIDENT OF FINANCE - THE TASTEE-
speaker_heading: FREEZ CORPORATION
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Thanks. We're perfectly happy with
dialog: our current supplier.
text: Kroc hands back the card, starts to walk off.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: I’m not looking to sell you ice
dialog: cream.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Then what do you want?
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: I caught a bit of your conversation
dialog: back there. Sounds like you're
dialog: having some financial troubles.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Why don’t you mind your own
dialog: business?
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: I’m a great admirer of your
dialog: establishment.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: That’s very nice.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: I lunch at your Waukegan location
dialog: at least thrice a week. And not
dialog: once have I ever failed to witness
text: a large, avid crowd.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Your point being...
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: If you’re not making money hand
text: over fist, something is gravely
dialog: amiss.
text: This gets Kroc’s attention.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - SHORT TIME LATER
dialog: 86.
text: Kroc enters the office with Sonneborn. As they pass the front
dialog: desk:
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: June, fetch the ledger.
scene_heading: INT. KROC’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Kroc and Sonneborn sit in front of the ledger.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: So to summarize, you have a
dialog: miniscule revenue stream, no cash
text: reserves, and an albatross of a
dialog: contract that requires you to go
text: through a glacially slow approval
dialog: process to enact changes--if
dialog: they’re approved at all. Which they
dialog: never are.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Am I missing anything?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I believe that covers it.
text: ON SONNEBORN-- thinking.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: Tell me about the land.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Land?
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: The land, the buildings, how that
dialog: whole aspect of it works.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Well, it’s pretty simple really.
text: The franchisee finds a piece of
text: land he likes, takes out a lease.
dialog: Usually 20-year. He gets himself a
dialog: construction loan, puts up the
text: building, and off he goes.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
text: So the operator selects the site.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: He picks the property. Not you.
text: Kroc nods, unsure why he’s so curious about all of this.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
dialog: You supply the training, the
dialog: system, the operational know-how,
dialog: and he’s responsible for the rest.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Correct.
text: ON SONNEBORN-- processing. He seems troubled.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: A big one.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Which is?
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: That you don’t seem to realize what
dialog: business you’re in.
speaker_heading: (BEAT )
dialog: You're not in the burger business.
dialog: You’re in the real-estate business.
text: Kroc looks totally confused.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
dialog: You don’t build an empire off a 1.4
text: percent cut of a 15-cent hamburger.
dialog: You build it by owning the land
dialog: upon which that burger is cooked.
text: ON KROC-- wrestling with this strange notion.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
dialog: What you ought to be doing is
dialog: buying up plots of land, then
dialog: turning around and leasing said
dialog: plots to franchisees, who as a
dialog: condition of their deal should be
dialog: permitted to lease from you and you
dialog: alone. This will provide you with
text: two things: One, a steady, upfront
dialog: revenue stream. Money flows in
text: before the first stake is in the
dialog: ground. Two, greater capital for
dialog: expansion.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 87.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
dialog: Which in turn fuels further land
dialog: acquisition, which in turn fuels
dialog: further expansion. And so on and so
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Land... That’s where the money is.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: And control. Control over the
dialog: franchisee: Fail to uphold quality
dialog: standards, you cancel their lease.
dialog: Control over Dick and Mac: Their
text: power stops at the building’s
dialog: foundation. Yours goes to the soil.
text: ON KROC-- absorbing, registering the full significance.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: If I were to do this... the
dialog: brothers... this would
dialog: effectively...
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: Yes.
text: A long BEAT. Kroc searching his soul. We can almost see the
text: Angel and the Devil on his shoulders.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
dialog: So whaddaya say, Ray?
text: The Harry & Ray Show. Sonneborn and Kroc jumping into action:
text: --Sonneborn taking meetings with BANKERS AND INVESTORS in New
text: York City. Confidently presenting his sweeping vision to
text: conference rooms of heavy hitters. He stands in sharp
dialog: contrast to Kroc... Kroc is Main Street, Sonneborn is Wall

text: --Hands being shaken, deals being struck.
text: --Kroc criss-crossing the country by plane shopping for land.
text: Scouting suburban neighborhoods, plots of land near schools

text: --Kroc and Sonneborn presiding over lease signings. MOLINE,
scene_heading: NASHVILLE, ORLANDO, KALAMAZOO.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Mac is wiping down the front counter.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (0.S.)

speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I have no clue. But apparently Ray
dialog: Kroc is president and CEO.
text: Mac takes the letter, instantly nauseous.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON letter, written on FRANCHISE REALTY CORPORATION
text: letterhead. The letter itself is some innocuous bit of
dialog: McDonald's business from Kroc to the brothers. It’s really
text: just an excuse to flash the letterhead. And the signature at
scene_heading: the bottom: RAYMOND A. KROC - PRESIDENT/CEO
scene_heading: INT. PRINCE CASTLE SALES - SHORT TIME LATER

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Hello, Dick. How are you?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Well, if you really want to know,
dialog: I’m tad miffed.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What seems to be the trouble?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Franchise Realty Corporation.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: For starters, would you mind
dialog: telling me what it is?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Oh, nothing really. Just a little
dialog: something I created to help provide
dialog: leasing services and support to our
dialog: new franchisees.
text: Dick can practically hear Kroc’s smirk through the phone.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: You know full well you can’t do
dialog: something like that without first
dialog: clearing it.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Why would I need to do that?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Why? Because as your deal plainly
dialog: states, any and all changes must—
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: It’s not a change.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: It’s not a change. It’s a company.
dialog: Its own separate company. Which
dialog: puts it outside of your purview.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Anything relating to McDonald's is
dialog: within our--
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You boys have full say over what

dialog: outside? Above? Below?... Your
text: authority stops at the door. And

scene_heading: INT. KROC’S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Let’s try a few by the map.
text: The PHOTOGRAPHER leads Kroc to the expansion map, which is
text: significantly more crowded with pins now. Kroc strikes the
text: same pose, arms winningly crossed.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Good, good.
text: Kroc impulsively grabs a prop hamburger off the desk, holds
text: it up for the camera.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Love it.

speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (gruff)
dialog: Delivery.
dialog: 92.
text: He turns, expecting to see a delivery man. Instead, Ray Kroc
text: is standing there, leaning against THREE BOXES on a dolly.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (like a delivery guy)
dialog: Where ya want these?
scene_heading: INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kroc looks on as Rollie opens one of the boxes, unsure what’s
dialog: inside.
text: ANGLE ON box’s contents: hundreds of silver-foil packets.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: (excited, surprised)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I’ve thought it over.
text: ON JOAN-- also there, anxiously awaiting Kroc’s next words.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Approved.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: Really? Oh, thank you!
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Thank you. It’s a whiz-bang idea.
dialog: And you thought of it.
text: Kroc revels in the feeling of playing kingmaker.
speaker_heading: ROLLIE SMITH
dialog: Well, we’re deeply honored to serve
dialog: as your test market.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: To heck with that. I’m rolling it
dialog: out nationally.
text: Joan gasps, honored, thrilled. Her idea, implemented across

text: ON ROLLIE-- looking at Joan looking at Ray. We finally detect
text: the first stirrings of jealousy.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Speaking of Inst-A-Mix, have you
dialog: seen the new issue of “RBM”?
dialog: 93.
text: Kroc reaches inside his coat, pulls out a copy of “Restaurant
text: Business Monthly”. Hands it to Rollie.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
text: Hot off the press.
text: ON ROLLIE-- taking in the cover...
text: ANGLE ON magazine. Kroc is the cover boy. A big photo of him
text: in his office, smiling, holding the hamburger. The headline:
scene_heading: MCDONALD’S TAKES A BITE OUT OF THE COMPETITION - UPSTART
text: HAMBURGER EMPORIUM IS ‘ON THE GROW’

scene_heading: INT. ROLLIE AND JOAN SMITH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Joan is on the kitchen phone, also speaking softly. She’s

speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: It’s about 10 miles south of

dialog: new sports stadium there.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I read about that.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: We're getting a professional

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I think I see where you’re going
dialog: with this...
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH

speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: Is there any other way to?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You'd be surprised.
text: His gaze drifts downward. To his wedding ring.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: A lot of people, they’re scared. Of

speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: That’s so sad.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I agree. Ambition, that’s the stuff

speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH
dialog: What’s that saying? “Fortune favors

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: JOAN SMITH

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: From Buddy Jepsen. Our operator in

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I’m well aware who Buddy Jepsen is.

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: He told me he received a shipment

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: It arrived?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: You are way out of line, Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I figured it wouldn’t get there

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Would you mind telling me what
dialog: you're doing shipping four cases of
dialog: Inst-A-Mix to one of our operators?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: If you’re not interested in turning

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Us?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Us. As in everyone but you.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Who did you send them to?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: You have a contract.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Don’t grow, don’t change... Cower
dialog: in the face of progress...
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: If phony powdered milkshakes is
dialog: your idea of progress, you have a
dialog: profound misunderstanding of what
text: McDonald’s is about.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I have a far better understanding
dialog: of McDonald’s than you two yokels.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You heard me.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: You will do as we say.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD

speaker_heading: LAWYER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

scene_heading: INT. MCDONALD'S (SAN BERNARDINO) - OFFICE - DAY
text: Dick enters the office. He notices a package on his desk,
text: addressed to him and Mac. He opens it, pulls out a silver-
text: foil Inst-A-Mix packet. It’s stamped “8S”.
text: Dick reaches in, pulls out a handwritten note from Kroc:
scene_heading: NEW FLAVOR... STRAWBERRY. MAYBE YOU’LL LIKE THIS ONE!
speaker_heading: --BEST, RAY
text: His dismay is soon eclipsed by something else:
dialog: The note from Kroc; it’s not on Franchise Realty Corporation
text: letterhead. The letterhead says THE MCDONALD'S CORPORATION.
scene_heading: It’s signed at the bottom RAYMOND A. KROC - PRESIDENT.
scene_heading: INT. FRANCHISE REALTY CORPORATION - SHORT TIME LATER
text: Workmen are taking down the Franchise Realty Corporation sign

speaker_heading: RAY KROC (0.S.)
dialog: It was confusing.
scene_heading: INT. KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Kroc on the phone.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC

scene_heading: INT. SAN BERNARDINO - CONTINUOUS
text: Dick on the other end. Mac there, too.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: What’s confusing is you calling
dialog: yourself the McDonald's
dialog: Corporation.
text: ON MAC-- listening, strangely calm.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
dialog: People will think it’s the whole

dialog: what you hope.
text: Without warning, Mac SNATCHES THE PHONE out of Dick’s hands--
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: IT’S NOT YOUR COMPANY, RAY!
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Mac.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Do you understand that?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Don’t get all bent out of shape.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: We came up with the Speedee System,
dialog: not you. Us. What did you ever come
dialog: up with, Ray? Name one thing. You
dialog: can’t. Because you never have and
dialog: you never will. You’re a leech!
dialog: You're a professional leech!
text: ON DICK-- stunned by his brother’s outburst.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Would you like to know what I came
dialog: up with? I’1l tell you, Mac. I came
text: up with a concept. A highly novel
dialog: concept called winning. You boys
dialog: are content to sit back and be a
dialog: couple of also-rans. To let the
dialog: future run roughshod over you. Me,
dialog: I want to take the future. I want
dialog: to win. And you don’t get there by
dialog: being some aw-shucks, nice-guy sap.
dialog: There’s no place in business for
dialog: people like that. Business is war.
dialog: It’s rat eat rat, dog eat dog. If
dialog: my competitor was drowning, I'd
dialog: reach out and stick a goddamn hose
dialog: in his mouth. Can you say the same?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: I can’t, nor would I want to.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Hence your single location.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: I want you out of this company.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: And how do you propose to do that?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: Whatever it takes. We’ll sue you if
dialog: necessary.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You couldn't afford to sue me. I
dialog: could bury you in court costs
dialog: alone. I’m the president and CEO of
dialog: a major corporation with
dialog: landholdings in 17 states. You run
text: a burger stand in the desert.
dialog: (blistering, nuclear)
dialog: I’m national. You’re fucking local.
text: Kroc hears a loud THUD through the phone.
text: Mac has COLLAPSED to the floor.
text: The wail of an AMBULANCE SIREN carries us to--
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Mac lies in a hospital bed looking pale and weak. Dick stands
text: by as DR. REEVES talks to Mac.
speaker_heading: DR. REEVES

dialog: (Mac nods)
dialog: Checking your glucose levels?

dialog: No smoking?
dialog: (Mac nods)
dialog: Any stress?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: (BEAT, understatement of
dialog: century)
dialog: Some.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: DR. REEVES
dialog: You need to watch that. It’s a big
dialog: contributing factor.
text: The doctor flips to a page in Mac’s chart.
speaker_heading: DR. REEVES (CONT'D)
dialog: As I said, your kidney function's
dialog: currently at 50 percent. 18 months

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD

speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD

dialog: The
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: How ya feelin’?
text: brothers glare at their unexpected, unwelcome guest.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: That was some spill. Felt it all
text: the way through the phone.
text: Kroc extends the flowers to Mac.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: For you.
dialog: 103.
text: Mac takes the flowers like they’re potentially laced with
text: anthrax. He glances at the card attached.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Open it.
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: That’s alright.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Please. I think you’1l like it.
text: Mac reaches in the envelope, pulls out a GET-WELL CARD. He

speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What’s it look like?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
text: It looks like a blank check.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Then that’s probably what it is.
text: Mac and Dick look at each other.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: How much should I make it out for?
speaker_heading: MAC MCDONALD
dialog: What are you buying?

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: RAY KROC

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: A million for each of us after

speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D)
dialog: And one percent of the company’s

scene_heading: INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Kroc is pacing furiously before Harry Sonneborn.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: It’s outrageous! Borderline

speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: And they want one other thing.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN
dialog: San Bernardino.
text: Kroc is taken aback.
speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN (CONT’D)
dialog: To give to their longtime

dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: I need San Bernardino. I was
dialog: counting on its profits to cover

speaker_heading: HARRY SONNEBORN

speaker_heading: KROC LAWYER
dialog: Our client agrees fully to your

dialog: exception. Your one percent cut of
dialog: future corporate earnings will have
dialog: to be carried out on a handshake
dialog: basis.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: On the insistence of my investor
dialog: group. Their financing is
dialog: contingent on leaving it out of the

text: Dick and Mac look at each other, extremely wary.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Hello, Dick.
text: ON DICK-- gazing searchingly at Kroc.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: I just have to ask you one thing.
dialog: Something I’ve never understood.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: That day we met, when we gave you
dialog: the tour.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: We showed you everything. The whole
dialog: system, all our secrets. We were an
dialog: open book.
dialog: (Kroc nods)
dialog: So why didn’t you just--
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Rip you off? Run off and start my
dialog: own place using your ideas?
dialog: (Dick nods)
dialog: Because it would have failed.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Am I the only one who ever got the
dialog: kitchen tour? I bet you invited
dialog: loads of people back there.
dialog: Countless would-be burger barons
dialog: looking to replicate your success.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: And?
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: How many succeeded?
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Lots of people started restaurants.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Bigger than McDonald's?
dialog: (Dick is silent)
dialog: Of course not. No one has and no
dialog: one ever will. Because they all
dialog: lack that one thing that makes
dialog: McDonald's special.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Which is...
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Even you don’t know!
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: Enlighten me.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: It’s not just the system. It’s the
dialog: name.
text: Dick doesn’t follow.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: That name. That glorious name.
text: McDonald. It’s wide open.
dialog: Limitless. It could be anything,
dialog: whatever you want it to be. It
dialog: sounds like... America.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Compare that to, oh, say, Kroc. Now
dialog: there’s a real lemon. Kroc. What a
dialog: erock. Load of crock. Crock of
dialog: shit. Would you eat at a place
dialog: called Kroc’s? It’s enough to make
dialog: you lose your appetite, a blunt,
dialog: Slavic thing like that. But
dialog: McDonald's, now that’s a name. A
text: fine, handsome, all-American name.
dialog: That’s a winner’s name, the name of
dialog: somebody who’s got the world by the
dialog: tail. A man named McDonald is never
dialog: going to get pushed around in life.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: That’s clearly not the case.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: So you don’t have a check for $1.35
dialog: million in your pocket?
text: Dick is silenced.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: That's the mistake your competitors
dialog: made. All those would-be imitators.
dialog: They assumed they could simply take
dialog: your system, slap on some name like
dialog: Hamburger Hamlet or Roscoe’s, and
dialog: presto! Instant success! Not me, I
dialog: wasn’t so arrogant. I knew there’s
dialog: no beating a name like McDonald's.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: And if you can’t beat ‘em...
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Buy ‘em.
text: Dick chuckles in disgust.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: I'll never forget the first time I
dialog: saw that name stretched across the
dialog: front of your stand. It was love at
dialog: first sight. From that moment, I
dialog: knew I just had to have it. And now
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: DICK MCDONALD
dialog: You don’t “have” it.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: You sure about that?

speaker_heading: KROC LAWYER
dialog: As per the terms of your agreement,

speaker_heading: THE BIG M
text: Below this, it says, with a whiff of desperation:
dialog: “WE HAVE BEEN HERE 23 YEARS!”
text: The sign is as close to a McDonald's marquee as is legally
text: possible, but it’s just not McDonald's. It’s heartbreaking.
text: PAN ACROSS THE STREET, where we see...
text: A NEW MCDONALD'S under construction. A hard-hatted Kroc is on

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (0.S.)

text: ANGLE ON card. Beneath a McDonald’s logo, it says, simply:
scene_heading: RAY KROC - FOUNDER
dialog: We hold on this for a long BEAT.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Now, I know what you’re thinking...
scene_heading: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS MANSION - DAY
text: A lavish, gated MANSION. A BLACK LIMOUSINE pulls into the
dialog: driveway.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS
text: A tuxedo-clad Ray Kroc stands before a mirror, stack of index
text: cards in hand. He’s 68 now; it’s nine years later, 1970.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: How the heck does an over-the-hill
text: 52-year-old milkshake-machine
dialog: salesman build a fast-food empire
dialog: with 1,600 restaurants in 50 states
dialog: and five foreign countries, with
dialog: annual revenues in the neighborhood
dialog: of $700 million? It’s quite simple:
dialog: persistence.
text: He turns to the next card.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Nothing in the world can take the
dialog: place of good old persistence.
dialog: Talent won't. Nothing’s more common
dialog: than unsuccessful men with talent.
dialog: Genius won't. Unrecognized genius
dialog: is practically a cliché.
text: His words have a familiar ring... They’re lifted straight
dialog: from “The Power Of The Positive” by Dr. Clarence Floyd Nelson
dialog: (the record from the beginning of the movie), with just a bit
text: of rephrasing to make it “his own”.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Education won’t. The world is full
dialog: of educated fools.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Persistence and determination alone
dialog: are all-powerful.
text: He pauses a beat to let his words of wisdom sink in.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: There’s no obstacle under the sun
dialog: that can’t be overcome with honest
dialog: hard work and determination. It’s
dialog: these core principles that enabled
dialog: me to rise to the top of the heap
dialog: at a point in life when most men
dialog: would be thinking about retirement.
dialog: (glances to side, sly
dialog: grin)
dialog: We appear to have that in common,
dialog: Mr. Governor.
text: He pauses for laughter.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: You were, what, 55 when you started
dialog: in politics? Why, you make me look
dialog: like a spring chicken!
text: Another pause for laughter.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Look at us, a couple of small-town
dialog: Illinois boys made good. Only in
dialog: America...
text: He continues talking to Mr. Governor off to the side--
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: By the way, thank you for that
dialog: splendid introduction. To be named
dialog: California Chamber of Commerce Man
dialog: of The Year is thrill enough, but
dialog: to be presented the award by my
dialog: dear friend and golf buddy Ronald
dialog: Reagan, well, that’s just the
text: cherry on the sundae.
text: He turns to the next index card.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: Now where was I? Ah, yes, the
dialog: beginning. The year was 1954. The
dialog: place, Des Plaines, Illinois.
dialog: That's where it all started. Right
dialog: there on Lee Street--
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: JOAN KROC (0.S.)
text: The car’s out front.
text: Joan Smith, now Joan Kroc, comes up behind him.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: (to her reflection)
dialog: Be right down.
text: She nods, exits the room.
text: Kroc looks down at the card in his hand, finding his place:
scene_heading: IT ALL STARTED. RIGHT THERE ON LEE STREET... MCDONALD'S #1
speaker_heading: RAY KROC (CONT’D)
dialog: --McDonald's #1.
text: Kroc’s eyes linger on those words on the card: MCDONALD’S #1.
text: He looks up, stares at himself in the mirror for a long BEAT.
text: As he takes in his reflection, we detect a flicker of
dialog: something on his face. Regret? Guilt?...
dialog: It may have just been our imagination.
text: He tucks the index cards in his pocket, stands up.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kroc and Joan Smith (now JOAN KROC) ride in the back of a
text: stretch limo. She’s in a powder-blue gown, draped in diamonds
dialog: and pearls.
speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER
dialog: Comfortable, Mr. Kroc?
text: An air conditioning vent blows cool air on Kroc.
speaker_heading: RAY KROC
dialog: Oh, yes.
dialog: (placid)
dialog: Very.
text: CAMERA slowly pushes in on Kroc’s face as he rides in
text: silence. He looks at Joan, smiles.
text: He indeed seems comfortable. Very.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: POSTSCRIPT:
dialog: Ray Kroc’s San Bernardino McDonald’s was an instant hit,
text: drawing customers away from The Big M across the street,
text: forcing it to close. The McDonald brothers were driven out of
dialog: business by a McDonald’s.
text: Kroc later reneged on the handshake deal for the one percent
dialog: cut of royalties. The brothers never received a cent. Today,
dialog: that one percent would be worth $200 million annually. Each.
dialog: From the moment Kroc took ownership, his business card listed
dialog: his title as “Founder”. Until his death decades later, calls
dialog: to McDonald’s headquarters asking the origin of the name were
dialog: told it was made up.
dialog: Kroc married Joan Smith in 1969. They remained together until
dialog: his death in 1984.
dialog: In 1971, Mac died of diabetes-related illness. His brother
dialog: Dick passed away in 1998.
dialog: Harry Sonneborn and Ray Kroc had a falling out in 1967.
dialog: Sonneborn sold all his shares in McDonald’s and never spoke
dialog: to Kroc again.
dialog: Thanks to Sonneborn’s idea, McDonald’s is today the largest
dialog: owner of real estate in the world.
