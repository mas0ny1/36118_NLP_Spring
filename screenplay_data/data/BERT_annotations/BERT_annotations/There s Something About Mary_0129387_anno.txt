speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Look, you asked me to follow your

dialog: it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Turn her over to a stalker.
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: HEALY

dialog: Give the big pig with the B.O. to
dialog: Healy, right? Well I was sick of it,
dialog: man! No more--it was my turn. It was

dialog: This is so pathetic that it actually gets to Ted. He sits

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well you didn't have to blow us both

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: You fucking prick, we had a deal--

dialog: (moves in on Tucker)
dialog: You crossed the line, man.
text: Tucker backs away nervously.
speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: TUCKER (CONT'D)
dialog: I swear! I didn't tell her nothing!
dialog: You probably did it yourself, you

speaker_heading: HEALY
dialog: Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why

speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You mean...Steve didn't say all that

speaker_heading: TUCKER

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The hell with you both--I'm out of
