speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Reese, get the Sister some salt

text: Johnson watches her. He's impressed by her courage.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Tell our hosts I need blood samples

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: You're a good doctor. They need
dialog: your services too. Couple of things
dialog: you might consider --
text: Reese doesn't want to hear it.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Maybe we've already been exposed.
text: As Karl speaks, he ties off his own arm, thumps a vein and

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Test all our blood when you get
dialog: back. Take some samples from Sister
dialog: Genevieve: here too --
scene_heading: SISTER'S POV - INSIDE ROVER
text: Sweat beads on her forehead under her habit. Her vision

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Maybe this bug can spread through

dialog: Strain --
text: Johnson tosses the blood vial --
speaker_heading: TO REESE
text: He stares at the blood vial like death itself.
scene_heading: ON JOHNSON - FRAMED BY THE DECIMATION
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: If it is Andromeda, then you won't

scene_heading: THE ROVER - INSIDE
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Who was the index case? The first
dialog: patient to "show"?
speaker_heading: SISTER GENEVIEVE
dialog: A Schoolteacher. We treated him for
dialog: malaria -- Two days later, he died
dialog: -- horribly. Every child at the
text: school came to the hospital.
dialog: Families -- pregnant women. All
dialog: broke with fever.
text: Johnson traces the spread in his mind, sorting, seeking --
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: But where did the teacher get the
dialog: bug? Rodent bites? -- Feces?
dialog: Mosquitoes? Monkeys maybe?
text: Sister Genevieve shakes her head bewildered. Who knows?
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: How did it spread so quickly? What
dialog: did you give the patients?
speaker_heading: SISTER GENEVIEVE
dialog: Injections. Chloroquine and
dialog: vitamins. These people do not
dialog: believe they have been "doctored"
dialog: unless we give them a shot...
text: She hesitates, almost confessing.
speaker_heading: SISTER GENEVIEVE
dialog: We only used five syringes a day to
dialog: treat everyone --
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (grim diagnosis)
dialog: Then the infection could've been
dialog: passed through the needles --
speaker_heading: SISTER GENEVIEVE
dialog: God forgive us... Some became
dialog: irrational -- hostile -- and
dialog: escaped! Hundreds became violently
dialog: ill and died in one week --
text: Silence. Johnson realizes he's facing nature's revenge.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Seven days. No time for an "immune
dialog: response." By the time the
dialog: patient's immune system throws
dialog: antibodies to fight the damn thing
dialog: -- it's too late...
text: She breaks down, sobbing. Johnson stops the Rover.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: You did what you could, Sister.

scene_heading: OUTSIDE - GREEN MONKEYS
text: Swarm the Rover on a food search, screeching "KRA, KRA."
scene_heading: INSIDE - CONTINUING ACTION

text: bodies, each with evidence of massive hemorrhaging from
dialog: every orifice.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON - CLOSER
text: He stops at one bed, carefully checking a YOUNG MAN for
text: signs of life. He feels for a pulse --
text: His glove fingers sink into the man's flesh like pudding.
text: Johnson reels back -- reviled. His breath labored.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON - JOHNSON'S GLOVED HAND
text: Taking a nose swab blood sample. Another swab inside the
text: Man's mouth -- and ears. With tweezers, he pinches out
text: samples of skin tissues.
text: WE FOLLOW bloody swaps and skin tissues into plastic
text: vials. Johnson tags and places each in the ice chest.
text: IN THE ICE CHEST - TIGHT ON THE TAG
dialog: Numbers: 001, etc., then, "Yambuku blood and epidermal
dialog: tissue slices - Ebola, Zaire."
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - SUNDOWN
text: Johnson exits, exhausted, solemn. Sister Genevieve is
text: still bent in prayer, motionless; wearing her respirator.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: No survivors. I've never seen a bug
dialog: kill like this one, Sister.
text: Fried by his experience, he surveys the jungle. Surreal
text: in the golden light. He's completely spaced.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: There must be members of some lost
dialog: tribe out there who've built up
dialog: immunities to this killer over the
dialog: years -- Their blood could have
dialog: powerful antibodies passed down
dialog: through the generations... strong
dialog: enough to save some lives --
dialog: (silence, he reaches
dialog: her)
dialog: Sister --
scene_heading: HIS POV - SISTER GENEVIEVE
text: Slowly raises her bowed head. Blood oozes from her

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: You spiked the damn fever -- We'll
dialog: get you to Kinshasa.
text: Blood traces from her tearducts -- her nose and ears.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Oh my god -- hold on -- hold on --
text: He pulls a syringe from his pocket -- thumps up a vein and
text: begins to shoot her full of antibiotics. She reflexes
text: away from the needle -- internal hemorrhages rock her --
text: Johnson jerks back. The SYRINGE PIERCES the glove on his
text: left hand. He stares at it in horror. He yanks it out
text: sucking his hand and spitting -- like a snake bite.
speaker_heading: SISTER GENEVIEVE
dialog: First... come... the... headaches --
text: She spasms suddenly -- coughing up black fluid --
text: THE VIEW ROCKETS UP UP INTO THE TREES --
text: Monkeys cry everywhere. "KRA! KRA!" We rocket right
text: into the face of the BIG GREEN MALE. Deep brown cloudy

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

dialog: The CDC and Karl Johnson in the same

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: With all due respect, Sir, we're

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: I'm Nancy Jaxx. Remember? -- I was

speaker_heading: JAXX

speaker_heading: JOHNSON

scene_heading: JAXX'S POV - THE RIVER

scene_heading: AT THE DRIFTER BOAT
text: Johnson stows his gear and starts to shove off. Jaxx
text: climbs in. Johnson thinks she's nuts.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Look -- I flew all night in a
dialog: military transport to get here. And
dialog: I heard your "Emerging Viruses" talk
dialog: at the Trop-med conference two years
dialog: ago -- in case you don't remember.
dialog: It was -- fascinating. See how this
dialog: makes you feel?
text: She pulls a folder from her daypack and shoves it to him.
text: Johnson eyes her warily as he opens it. He stares at --
scene_heading: PETER'S EBOLA MICROGRAPHS
text: Old ghosts haunt him. PUSH IN ON JOHNSON'S EYES: Fixed
text: on the image. SOUNDS OF AFRICA surround him.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Unless you include the feeling
text: generated by gazing into the eyes of
dialog: a cobra, "fascination" is not what I
dialog: feel about Ebola.
dialog: (looks right at Jaxx)
dialog: How about 'Shit scared'?
text: Johnson abruptly casts off. Jaxx almost falls in.
scene_heading: FOLLOW THE BOAT - DOWNRIVER
text: Through the rapids. Jaxx whoops hanging on.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: There's never been a case of Ebola
dialog: isolated on this continent! How in
dialog: the hell did it get to Virginia?!

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: What about exposure? Anybody died

speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Just the monkeys. And one exposure
dialog: at our lab so far.

dialog: face --
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: You don't know that for sure -- do
dialog: you? Do you? You don't know how
dialog: many people this bug could be
dialog: incubating in do you? And I'll bet
dialog: my hat the CDC doesn't know either.
text: She doesn't. He doesn't wait for an answer. He stalks
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: I warned them this would happen.
dialog: They didn't see what I saw in
dialog: Africa. As long as these viruses
dialog: are killing black people and yellow
text: people and red and brown in far off

dialog: woolly damn here at home?
scene_heading: EXT. JOHNSON'S CABIN - CONTINUING ACTION

dialog: African and South American artifacts, carvings, photos --
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Dr. Johnson, I think you should know
dialog: the Ebola vaccine has been a

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: And you haven't got one yet, do you?
dialog: Do you?
text: Jaxx shakes her head "no" guiltily.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Do you know where Ebola comes from?
dialog: Huh? The natural host? The
dialog: reservoir? After all these years?
dialog: -- Take a wild guess --
text: Jaxx angrily shakes "no." He opens the Dewars --
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Don't say monkeys. The Virus kills
dialog: them too quick for a monk to be a
dialog: host. Twelve years and we still
dialog: don't know what animal, vegetable,
dialog: mineral or insect Ebola comes from.
text: -- fishing a glass from a shelf, he fills it and knocks it
text: back. No sympathy from Jaxx.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: So what are you hiding out here for?
text: He shoots her a lethal look.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Okay, "fishing." I mean -- why did
dialog: you retire? Quit your research?
text: He pours another and one for her. His voice calms.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Why? Because nobody really wants to
dialog: cure these diseases. The
dialog: Bureaucrats and Doctors would rather
dialog: fight over who gets credit -- and
dialog: who patents the cure.
dialog: (hands her a drink)
dialog: The world's got a gun to it's head
dialog: and there's nothing I can do to keep
text: it from pulling the trigger.
dialog: It absolutely predestined truth the way Karl says it.
text: Jaxx heard Peter say it. She heard enough.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: -- You don't remember me, but I
dialog: remember this about you -- I heard
dialog: you say the best place to be in an
dialog: outbreak is at the epicenter...
dialog: trying anything possible to stop it
dialog: -- I guess I was mis-informed...
text: She returns the full glass, completely disillusioned.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Go... fishing.
text: She shakes perfunctorily and heads for the door. Johnson
text: watches her go with profound regret.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Hey -- Jaxx. We found another virus
dialog: in a lot of the blood samples we
dialog: took in Zaire. AIDS.
text: Jaxx stops. Chilled.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: We had AIDS samples back in '76?
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Yeah. But it wasn't killing anyone.
dialog: Ebola was.
text: He chokes it off. Pain and sorrow in his eyes.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: We could've been ready for AIDS. We
dialog: could've saved some lives.
text: Jaxx stares at him in stunned silence, reeled by the
dialog: ramifications. She has a better understanding of this

text: Peter looks at the non-existent watch on his suit wrist.
speaker_heading: PETER (TALK PORT)
dialog: Let's see, I was exposed two days
dialog: ago. Incubation takes about a week;
dialog: therefore. If I'm infected, I
dialog: should be getting my first headaches
dialog: in, oh, about five days. If I spike
dialog: a fever, seven days later -- the

speaker_heading: JOHNSON

speaker_heading: PETER (TALK PORT)

speaker_heading: PETER (TALK PORT)

dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON

speaker_heading: JOHNSON (FM MIC)
dialog: How are you fixed for Sister

speaker_heading: PETER (FM MIC)
text: Gold plated stuff. Her immuno

dialog: At least in my guinea pigs.

speaker_heading: JOHNSON (FM MIC)
dialog: Sister "G"... she beats Ebola -- She

speaker_heading: PETER (FM MIC)
dialog: We're down to less than four units.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON (FM MIC)
dialog: That's not quite enough to fight an

speaker_heading: PETER (FM MIC)
dialog: If Sister "G" was alive, I could

speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Well let's get one! If we can pull

text: Reese nods Karl's kudos. Karl pulls out Tiny's photo.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Pete's a long shot to survive. So

dialog: weeks ago with the other handlers
dialog: before everyone else -- He threw
dialog: antibodies and was still alive two
dialog: days ago -- after his partner
dialog: checked into the morgue. That's a
dialog: good sign. We'd be irresponsible

dialog: Well -- too bad you never found that

speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Mom... this is the "slammer" isn't

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Listen to me. I want you to give

speaker_heading: GERRY

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Don't you die on me! Don't you
dialog: dare! Live Goddamnit. I need a
dialog: survivor -- damn you -- live!
text: He dumps his respirator -- he desperately checks the big

text: THE HUEY SWOOPS UP over the bluff and lands. AIT's jump
text: out bringing more gear and the isolator.
text: Two AIT's spray fire extinguishers on the burning cabin.
scene_heading: TO TINY AND KARL
text: Tiny is not responding to CPR. Karl pumps air into his
text: mouth. Nothing.
text: Karl rips open his shirt -- his body is covered with
text: hemorrhages and skin ruptures.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: You're not dying on me, Tiny. C'mon
dialog: you son-of-a-bitch --
text: Reese hands him a big needle. He shoots the adrenalin
text: right in Tiny's heart. Nothing. He pounds the man's
text: chest. Reese pulls him back pinning him.
speaker_heading: REESE
text: He's gone. He's dead...
text: Karl, angry at himself and the world, holds it all in. He
text: closes Tiny's eyes.
speaker_heading: AIT (O.S.)
dialog: Hey! Over here --
text: Reese looks up, stunned by what he sees. He grabs Karl.
text: WHAT THEY SEE: AN APPARITION - JUST LIKE KARL'S DREAM
text: A GIRL walks out of the flaming smoldering Cabin. Tiny's
text: white trash girlfriend from the Roadhouse. She's dazed,
text: suffering from smoke inhalation, alive. A survivor.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Now that is a genuine miracle.
text: Karl approaches her. She reaches out both hands and
text: collapses. He catches her laying her down.
text: THE POLICE HELICOPTER ARRIVES HOVERING OVERHEAD
speaker_heading: VOICE (P.A.)
dialog: This is the Virginia State Police.
dialog: Clear the burning area --
text: Karl pays no attention checking the girl's vitals. More
text: Police and Rangers arrive up the fire road in the b.g.
scene_heading: ON THE CABIN - WIDER
text: Rangers join the effort to put out the fire. AIT's meet
text: the Police keeping them away from potential contagion.
scene_heading: WITH KARL AND THE GIRL
text: Reese gives her oxygen. Karl injects her with antivirals.
text: He checks her arms and neck for hemorrhages. No
dialog: petechiae.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: No symptoms. Maybe she's
text: incubating.
text: He finds a small patch of symptomatic rash on her back.
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: She's got the bug.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Yeah, so? For how long? A week? A
dialog: day? What's her temperature?
speaker_heading: REESE
dialog: (shocked)
text: Ninety-nine. She's almost normal.
dialog: She should be roasting if he
dialog: infected her in the last week.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: Unless... she's a survivor.
dialog: Unless... she's immune.
text: Karl looks at the girl. Traumatized but her pulse is

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: We have to get her back to RIID.
dialog: Now! Move!

scene_heading: INSIDE THE COPTER - FLYING

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Tim? Where's Tim? Have to take
dialog: care of him. He's so sick --
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (floored, realizing)
dialog: She was no hostage. She liked the

text: Karl clamps a field centrifuge onto a seat back and begins
text: cranking. The blood sacks spin --
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: OUTSIDE - THE ROTORS SPIN
text: They fly straight into the morning sun.
speaker_heading: SHARP CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MORGUE - MORNING
text: Another corpse slides in the rack. It's Girard. There is

scene_heading: INT. SLAMMER - MORNING
text: Jamie. Her arm covered with petechiae. The rest of her

scene_heading: INT. PETER'S BL3 LAB - SAME TIME
text: Jaxx, dark circles under her eyes, exhausted, studies a
text: cell culture in the monitor attached to her microscope.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Grow. C'mon -- grow. Maybe the CDR
dialog: grafting didn't take.
text: She turns to another monitor showing a complicated cell
text: structure turning in 3D graphics. The heading reads:
scene_heading: "RECOMBINANT IG MOLECULES - MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES."
text: She rotates the diagram with key commands. She looks up.
text: Someone enters the lab in a spacesuit. The figure moves
text: closer. It's Peter. Weak and frail, but he's there.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Pete -- what are you doing -- ?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, I'm beating this thing, okay. I
dialog: feel good --
text: He does a wobbly James Brown in his spacesuit. Jaxx is
text: blown away he's even walking.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The irony of it all. I wore this
dialog: thing for years to keep the bugs
dialog: out. Now I'm wearing it to keep
dialog: them in.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Pete? Your fever broke?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Fever? What fever? Hey? You
dialog: trying to take credit for my work?
dialog: "Synthetic generation of human
dialog: antibodies by combination with super
dialog: immune animal cells" by Peter
dialog: Jahrling...
text: Jaxx eyes him suspiciously. He studies the monitor.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I've been grafting high immunity
dialog: guinea pig cells to human myeloma
dialog: cells, but the fusion hybridoma
dialog: immortalizes only a few B cells.
dialog: Low antibody production. Useless
dialog: against a mother-bug like Ebola.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: I used Supermonk's IG genes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm impressed. Better gene match
dialog: with humans.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: The immunoglobulins won't clone.
dialog: It's not working.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Here's your problem. Change the
dialog: binding site. Splice the genes here
dialog: and hope it grows up to be the Holy
dialog: Grail.
text: Peter makes some adjustments to the computer generated
dialog: cell diagram.
text: Jaxx looks at the screen in awe. The two cells form one
dialog: super immune cell. (Computer graphic).
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: You're a genius, Pete. Let's get
dialog: you back to the slammer.
text: He resists her, hugging the stool, barely able to focus.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I have to finish this. If the
dialog: human cells you're using are strong
dialog: and healthy, this just might work.
dialog: Whose are they?
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Mine.
text: Peter looks at her through his helmet, he smiles --
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, I'd say if your daughter has
dialog: any of the stuff her mother's made
dialog: of -- her children and her
dialog: grandchildren will be born immune --
text: Jaxx wells up at the hope he's given her. Hope. A final
text: tear of blood trickles from his eye.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: C'mon -- let's get you back to...
dialog: the... slammer... Pete? Pete!
text: No answer. Pete lumps over in his bluesuit -- and dies.

speaker_heading: JOHNSON

dialog: Let'em in. C'mon. What the hell
dialog: have you been doing -- fishing?
scene_heading: INT. RIID - CONTINUING ACTION

speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: We're losing her, Karl.
text: He shoves the plasma bags at Gerry.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Put her on this. Tiny bought the

dialog: Reese spun the plasma phoresis in
dialog: the chopper -- Check it for
dialog: antibodies. I think she's immune.
dialog: I think she's the "magic bullet."
text: They look at each other -- vaporlock. Gerry grabs the
dialog: bags.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: I'll screen it. Just don't let
dialog: Jamie die.
text: He runs out shouting for C.J. Karl hovers over Jamie --

speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: (finding her voice)
dialog: Pete had a breakthrough. He did it.
dialog: We can crank out Ebola immune cell
dialog: antibodies in a few weeks --
text: Jaxx is all nerve endings watching Jamie.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: That's not fast enough. Let's get
dialog: Pete on this new plasma too.
text: He can tell by her reaction, Pete's dead. He bows his

scene_heading: SLAMMER CORRIDOR - CONTINUING ACTION
text: Karl drags Jaxx into the last room --
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: It's the only chance Jamie or any of
dialog: us have got. Meet the donor.
text: Maj. Hoskins tends the Girl. She's sitting up in the

text: She glares at Karl.
scene_heading: MAJ. HOSKINS
dialog: Her temperature is normal, Doctor.
dialog: Pulse stable.
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: Hey, where's Tim? What is this
dialog: place? Anybody got a cigarette?
text: Karl shakes his head no. Jaxx checks her chart in shock.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: "Angel."
text: Jaxx looks to Karl. What else --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WAR ROOM - LATER
text: C.J. is on a phone hookup to CNN. TV's show all networks.
dialog: C.J.

speaker_heading: JAXX

dialog: Gerry burst in --
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: She's clean. No "hep." HIV's

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (continuing the
dialog: thought)
dialog: But -- "Angel" has minimal
dialog: symptoms --
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: (finishing it)
dialog: -- then Karl's right. She must be
dialog: immune.
text: The whole slammer is buzzing. Gerry looks to Jaxx for a
text: decision. Jaxx hooks the desperation plasma up herself.
scene_heading: GOD'S POV - DESCENDS LOWER - CLOSER
text: Jaxx gets right beside Jamie as close as the plastic will
text: allow. She whispers, determined not to give up.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: You listen to me Jamie Magritte
dialog: Jaxx, God gave you an immune system
dialog: to fight disease with -- so fight.
dialog: Don't think about anything else but
dialog: living. You want to do a triple
dialog: twist -- live, Jamie, live. You
dialog: want to go to the Olympics don't
dialog: you?
text: She strokes Jamie's face through the glove port. Gerry is
text: right beside her. Karl leans into view on the other side.
speaker_heading: GERRY
dialog: Kick this bug in the ass. Never,

scene_heading: THE VIEW GLIDES TO JAMIE - "ANGEL" I.V. IN VIEW

speaker_heading: SHARP CUT TO:
text: A WATERFALL CRASHES ONTO ROCKS BELOW - WIDEN TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE BIGHORN RIVER - DAY
text: It's Spring. Karl and Jaxx sit on the bank reflecting.

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: On a day like this, we can pretend
dialog: nature is benign -- and all the
dialog: monsters and beasts in nature have
dialog: their kinder moments.
text: Jaxx looks up. Quietly crying.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: I didn't think it'd be this hard.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON

speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: I just see her lying there. I don't
dialog: know how I'll ever be able to -- to

speaker_heading: JAMIE (O.S.)
dialog: Mom -- look, Mom -- wahooo!
scene_heading: PAN TO: THE RIVER
text: There in the middle of the beautiful Big Horn is Beautiful

speaker_heading: GERRY

scene_heading: KARL AND JAXX - HOOTING FROM THE BANK
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: (musing sadly)

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Without his discovery, and Angel's

dialog: here either. Her synthesized

speaker_heading: JAXX

speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: We weren't ready for this one. This
dialog: was a wakeup call. We're just one
dialog: international plane flight away from
dialog: extinction.
text: Jaxx sits up on that one staring at him. What?
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: Sure. Say a tourist gets an unknown
dialog: airborne virus in an African village
text: in the morning, flies home that day,
text: smoking, coughing -- sneezing.
text: Aerosol droplets get circulated by
dialog: the air vents -- so by the time you
dialog: land, everyone onboard's been
text: exposed. Passengers walk through
dialog: customs right back home exposing

text: night thousands are exposed. Then
dialog: the outbreak. Slate wiper...
text: Silence. The sounds of nature abound. Jaxx is riveted.
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: (inevitable)
dialog: Pretty soon us two-legged dinosaurs

speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: Mother nature's revenge... God, I'll
dialog: never fly again... Why not go back
dialog: to Africa and find the viruses
dialog: before they find us, huh?
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: I never should have left.
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: You better teach me to fish quick,
dialog: because that's where you're going.
text: Jaxx jumps up, brushing herself off. Karl gets up --
speaker_heading: JOHNSON
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: JAXX
dialog: You raised so much hell, the CDC and
dialog: the Army are joint funding a new

scene_heading: SUPER: THE FOLLOWING LEGENDS
dialog: 1. To date the origin or reservoir of the Ebola virus is

dialog: 2. The CDC levied fines against Synergy and three other

dialog: into the United States for 18 months.
text: 3. No virus was found at the JFK animal unit where the
dialog: monkeys entered the U.S. The Philippine exporter
dialog: would not allow a CDC/Army Team to inspect their

dialog: 4. Monkeys with the Ebola virus were reported in primate
dialog: quarantine units in Texas and Pennsylvania during the
dialog: Reston outbreak.
text: 5. Nancy and Gerry Jaxx are both acting Colonels of
dialog: Veterinary Medicine at USAMRIID and are actively
dialog: involved in vaccine and viral research... including
dialog: Ebola.
text: 6. Peter Jahrling is alive and well and Head of Virology
text: at USAMRIID. He continues his research on synthetic
dialog: antibodies and is currently in South America isolating

dialog: efforts to control the spread of the Hantavirus
dialog: outbreak in this country.
text: 8. Karl Johnson lives in Montana with his wife Merle near
