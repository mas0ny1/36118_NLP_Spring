dialog: There are other opinions...
dialog: He died last summer on his birthday,
dialog: July second -- it’s much too early
dialog: To guess what history will decide
dialog: About him...
dialog: This was put together from many
dialog: Sources -- from all that footage
dialog: Shot by the TV and documentary
dialog: Film-makers -- and also the students,
dialog: Critics and young directors who
dialog: Happened to bring sixteen and eight
text: Millimeter cameras to his birthday
dialog: Party ...
dialog: The choice of the material is an
dialog: Attempt to sketch a film likeness

dialog: (getting ready to
dialog: repeat his question)
dialog: Mr. Hannaford --
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (briskly changing
dialog: voices -- some
dialog: celebrated and
dialog: ridiculously inap-
dialog: propriate character)
dialog: Mr. Hannaford began his career as a
dialog: prop an in the old cliff-hangers...
text: Bombs, buzz-saws, pits full of deadly
dialog: serpents -- he provided all the
dialog: disasters --
speaker_heading: PISTER (0.S.)
dialog: Mumbles...
speaker_heading: HIGGAM (0.S.)
dialog: What?... Of course, it was
dialog: Hollywood --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (half to himself)
dialog: Another town of the same name...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (after a brief pause,
dialog: prompting him)
dialog: Yeah -- ?
text: Another tiny pause.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT:
dialog: 33
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: A cross between a small-time mud-show
text: and a mining camp... Exhilarating.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (prompting again)
dialog: You shared a bungalow with your first
dialog: leading man -- I even know his name:
dialog: Frank Fryer. How about that? And
dialog: I’m the only one that’s not doing a
dialog: book on you --
speaker_heading: PISTER (0.S.)
dialog: Oh -- ?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You aren’t drinking either.
speaker_heading: PISTER
dialog: I thought you were, Otterlake --
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: The whiskey’s for him, Pister, and
dialog: let’s have it -- ! ...The book, you
dialog: mean -- ? My book on Hannaford is
dialog: how I got to Hollywood -- The
dialog: publishers’ advance...
dialog: Lots of very busy business
text: in the back seat as JAKE’s
dialog: drink is prepared and
dialog: passed up to him...
dialog: 34
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE (contd. )
dialog: Five chapters took the two of us
dialog: two and a half years... I finally had
dialog: to begin directing movies myself so I
dialog: could eat.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: The rest is history.
speaker_heading: PISTER (0.S.)
dialog: And now you’re too busy?
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: No, but he is -- And take it from me,
dialog: fellas, he hates being interviewed.
dialog: That’s what’s making this whole thing
dialog: today so delightful... Zarah’s idea --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIGGAM
dialog: (unnecessarily)
dialog: Zarah Valeska.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (assuming another
dialog: famous voice)
dialog: She is the one giving the party --
dialog: (another voice)
dialog: Yes, and she’s the one dreamed up
dialog: this crazy communications orgy, where
dialog: ‘the younger people of the cinema’ --
dialog: (in his own voice)
dialog: -- whatever that means, are let loose
dialog: on him. Well, happy birthday...
dialog: 35
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE (contd. )
dialog: I donated a lot of my old tapes --
dialog: (into yet another
dialog: impression)
dialog: Scattered ‘em here and there among you
dialog: cineastes, just out of kindness. We
dialog: can spare him a few questions, I
dialog: figure, if the answers come first.
text: The cineastes in the back
dialog: seat are too confused by
dialog: this virtuosity to really
dialog: take it in.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE (contd. )
dialog: Answers are my department... The
dialog: first Hannaford films? -- Silents,
dialog: with David Fryer. Action pictures --
dialog: (another voice)
dialog: Plenty of action. Why, Jake and Dave
dialog: used to strip to the waist every
dialog: Saturday night, put their two pay
text: envelopes on the mantlepiece and fight
dialog: each other for the pot...
dialog: (then, after a
dialog: moment, in his own

dialog: Whatever happened to him?
speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (after a moment, to

scene_heading: HANNAFORD’S FILM...
speaker_heading: MAX DAVID'S VOICE

speaker_heading: BILLY’S VOICE
dialog: (unhappily)

speaker_heading: MAX DAVID'S VOICE
dialog: What’s the bomb for?
speaker_heading: BILLY’S VOICE
dialog: (with a short
dialog: nervous laugh)
dialog: Jesus, I don’t know...

scene_heading: THE ROUGH CHARACTER
dialog: I don’t have the insurance... See ya

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: He knows you, all right --
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN
dialog: (the one in front)
dialog: Pretty good director --
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: He thinks he is you.
text: (then, with a quick
dialog: grin)
dialog: But don’t we all?
text: Meanwhile, PISTER is about
text: to be tossed out on his ear.
dialog: It seems that the law won’t
speaker_heading: allow the SOUNDMAN to ride
text: on the trunk of the car, so
dialog: room has to be made for him

speaker_heading: MAX DAVID

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (starting to drown
dialog: slightly)
text: Others, beside him... like the FBI or

speaker_heading: MAX DAVID

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Some kinda radical, Max
dialog: (interrupting himself

dialog: 43
speaker_heading: BILLY (contd. )
dialog: Anyway, there’s some shops there, and

speaker_heading: MAX DAVID
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: Which doll -- ?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (after a short silence)
text: The one he thinks she was looking at.
dialog: So... he goes in and buys it for

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: PISTER
dialog: They threw me out. And then I was

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: PAT

scene_heading: THE LIBRARY IN THE RANCH
text: With cool, professional patience, ZARAH

speaker_heading: ZARAH

speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: And vice versa --
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: And that’s why so few of your guests

speaker_heading: FOURTH CITIZEN
dialog: Look at the dictators... Symphony

speaker_heading: The CITIZENS chuckle

speaker_heading: FIFTH CITIZEN

speaker_heading: JACK SIMON

scene_heading: JULIE RICH AND COMPANY
speaker_heading: ROGER

speaker_heading: JACQUELINE
dialog: (quietly serious)
text: The old man is a destroyer.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
text: What he creates, he has to wreck.

speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: It’s a theory.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH

scene_heading: THE PROJECTION ROOM AT THE RANCH
dialog: 
text: Lights dim out, there are

text: throat-clearings... Then,
text: on the screen we resume:
speaker_heading: HANNAFORD’S FILM
dialog: 
text: The door to this (part-time) projection room is
text: important: when people open it, their silhouettes
text: move across the screen. THE ACTRESS is the first
text: to make such an entrance and, as she finds herself
dialog: a place, is the cause of interested attention...
text: Later there’s another interruption: the opening
text: door (the square of light blanking out part of the
text: screen -- the crouching and ducking silhouettes as
text: new arrivals sneak heavily into the room). This
text: time it’s JULIE RICH with a couple of journalist
text: colleagues. They make a dash for it into the
dialog: darkest corner of the room. Here, there aren’t
text: any chairs, but the view of the screen in unimpeded,
text: so they sit on the floor. ROGER and DENISE KLEE
text: (a film-making partnership) are squatting nearby,
text: their backs to the wall.
text: Soon others in the room become aware of a low and
text: rather venomous buzzing from the corner.
speaker_heading: ROGER
speaker_heading: (addressing JULIE
speaker_heading: RICH)
dialog: Don’t try to lay that on us --
speaker_heading: KLEE
dialog: (total incredulity)
dialog: You can say almost anything else
dialog: about him --
dialog: They do, but for the
dialog: moment they shut up.
text: THE FILM continues...

speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (elaborately
dialog: patient, wind-

dialog: There, where you’re standing.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Come on, cooperate...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN
text: The reflection in the glass -- The
text: face and the film inside -- a real
dialog: Hannaford set-up!
dialog: During this OTTERLAKE
dialog: has laughingly urged
dialog: JAKE into place. Now,
text: as the camera turns,
text: he fills in the lull
dialog: with a quotation:
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: “These, your actors, were all spirits-
dialog: And are melted into air...
dialog: Into thin air...”
dialog: 90
dialog: JAKE has started a

speaker_heading: the voice of JULIE
speaker_heading: RICH:
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: Tatum, Fryer, Leigh...
dialog: Branch Sutter... Garvey...
text: He smiles at her...
dialog: Then, after a short
dialog: silence:
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: Absent friends.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: And John Dale... All made by you
dialog: --. Funny. We don’t see one of those
dialog: men tonight at your party.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Tonight is for the freaks and
dialog: snoops, lady -- If you’ll excuse us,
dialog: please...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Why don’t you go in and see the
dialog: movie, lady -- like everybody else?
text: They wait for her to
dialog: go... She does.
dialog: 91
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: “Thin air...”
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: “And like the baseless fabric of
dialog: this vision, shall dissolve...”
dialog: Did you know they had dissolves in
dialog: Shakespeare?
dialog: (playing it up a
dialog: little for the
dialog: benefit of the
dialog: camera)
dialog: Sure he does: he knows everything
dialog: in Shakespeare. “The Hannaford
dialog: family curse -- ”
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And he knows everything about the
dialog: Hannafords; that’s my curse...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: We all know about old Grandad, Junius
dialog: the First -- “The great Irish
dialog: tragedian in the tinseled toga -- “
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: The Shakespeare comes from him,
dialog: all right.
dialog: 92
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
text: Handed down, with a few other things
dialog: -- “Booze and the Bard” -- Right?...
dialog: As for the booze part of it -- Well,
dialog: if he hasn’t quite made it asa
dialog: rummy -- nobody can say he hasn’t
dialog: tried!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I’m seeing little pink directors at
dialog: this very minute.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: But Junius -- Ah, “there was a most
dialog: distinguished souse”... Another
dialog: line of yours.

speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: That's me, Skipper.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I didn't know you had the chandelier.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: I’ve got everything.
dialog: In the old Hollywood Hotel it was...
dialog: They found him, one Sunday morning,
dialog: hanging from it. After which you
dialog: had to go to work for a living...
dialog: As a prop man, etcetera...
dialog: 94
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah... you got it all.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: I’m the Authority.
dialog: (Is there -- behind the
dialog: complacency of that
dialog: statement -- an overtone
dialog: of old affection still
dialog: remaining? If so, it
text: rings a little false in
dialog: JAKE'S ears... Somehow
dialog: his young friend has
dialog: staked out a claim of
dialog: ownership)...
text: He looks at him with
dialog: something very cold in
text: his eyes... OTTERLAKE
text: smiles back at him with
dialog: proprietory approval...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE (contd. )
dialog: So... what do we do next?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We never know, do we?
dialog: A pause...
text: JAKE is in a sort of
dialog: reverie... This has
dialog: commenced earlier and
dialog: comes from thoughts
dialog: far removed from family

text: He raises his glass as

speaker_heading: JAKE (contd. )
dialog: We're feeling fine -- it’s early
dialog: morning --
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Not quite yet.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: This is a flash-back...
dialog: You just happen to notice somebody
text: trying to drown himself. Some young
dialog: pink nobody ever heard of. And how's
dialog: this? After you dry him out, you try
dialog: to get him interested in staying
dialog: dry...
dialog: Hell, you can recite that story
dialog: backwards. And it’s lousy -- I can’t
dialog: get him interested in anything.
dialog: Everything’s a drag, man -- Be a
dialog: movie actor? That just bores him to
dialog: death... He doesn’t die, though; no,
text: he’s cured of that. He merely kicks
text: me rather sharply in the groin and
text: walks away...
text: though offering a toast.
dialog: Speaking of suicides.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Come on, Skipper -- let’s go to the
dialog: movies...
text: They start away together.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: THE BIG ROOM
dialog: One group (among all the

speaker_heading: LUCAS, or some other

scene_heading: INTERCUT: MIXED REACTIONS
scene_heading: FROM OTHER CINEASTES
dialog: Listening to the recorded

speaker_heading: AN EARNEST VOICE

speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE
dialog: (playback)
dialog: Well, kid -- He’s certainly Jewish.
speaker_heading: FRESH ANGLE:
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: What’s that about?
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: One of my tapes. I’ve donated them to
dialog: the cause.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: Tapes -- from that book you're doing?
dialog: 97
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: From the book we're not doing... I’m
dialog: the little corner store, Abe, that
text: has to give way to the supermarket.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: You’re the only big director who ever
dialog: tried to write about him.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: I had to stop trying.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: But you two are friends... Close
dialog: friends --
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (lurking at OTTER-
speaker_heading: LAKE’S shoulder)
dialog: That's what interests me: just how
dialog: close you are...
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Abe, this is Juliette Rich, the
dialog: distinguished critic. Abe Vogel, the
dialog: dean of Hollywood agents... Miss Rich
dialog: is doing a “study in depth” -- and
text: she’s so far down she’s got the bends.
dialog: (turning to the

speaker_heading: TAPE RECORDER)
dialog: What happened to the tape?
text: Laughter... OTTERLAKE
dialog: grins and continues:
dialog: 98
speaker_heading: THE CINEASTE
dialog: I’m changing it.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Don’t bother. I know all the material
dialog: ... Religion? Here it is, The Gospel
dialog: According to Jake: “God the Gather is
dialog: an old Jew invented by a lot of other
text: old Jews in a hopeless attempt to put
dialog: down the Jewish Mother.”
dialog: He says that’s what it’s all about --
dialog: the whole new scene... Even his
dialog: movie --
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (cutting in
dialog: sharply)
dialog: How’s that again -- ? His mov --
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (cutting her off
dialog: in turn, very
dialog: quickly)
text: The kids -- they're all turned on to
dialog: Her...
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: The Jewish mother?
dialog: More laughter...
dialog: Total silence follows
dialog: that...
text: The crowd is startled
dialog: 99
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (Louis Armstrong
dialog: or Flip Wilson)
dialog: God? -- She sure is a mother -- !
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (unsmilingly)
dialog: You said about his mov --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (now it’s his turn
dialog: to cut her off)
dialog: We don’t talk about the movie.
dialog: by his sudden appearance,
dialog: and also (JAKE himself
dialog: feels) a bit dashed by
dialog: the abruptness of his
text: tone... He smiles his
dialog: most benevolent and
text: priestly smile.
dialog: Try the Baron here... Under torture
dialog: he might squeal a little. He writes
dialog: the scripts --
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: So Mr. Hannaford likes to say --
text: This stops her dead
dialog: in her tracks...
dialog: 100
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (to THE BARON)
dialog: Then this is your idea-- ?
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: (amiably blank)
dialog: What idea?
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (losing her cool
dialog: a little, she
dialog: has a hunch
dialog: they're putting
dialog: her on)
dialog: Don’t pretend to be stupid. You're
dialog: the brainy one in this famous club
dialog: of yours -- or “Clan: or whatever you
dialog: call it --
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: It's a highly informal organization.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: That tape we were hearing -- the
dialog: subject was God... Is He a member?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: She.
dialog: 101
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: You heard the man, lady.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: I heard you imitating him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: He does other people better.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (as Jack Benny)
dialog: Well -- It came to Our Prophet in
text: a blinding flash of light, that Old
text: Mister White Whiskers has shot his
dialog: last thunderbolt, so... we’re back
dialog: where we started --
dialog: (his own voice)
dialog: -- Back to Mamma.
dialog: (playing to the
dialog: gallery)
dialog: His words, mark you -- The Last of The
dialog: Male Chauvinists --
speaker_heading: JACK SIMON
dialog: (a sneer out of
dialog: the shadows)
dialog: I like him as Hannaford. That’s his
dialog: beat. You’d swear he is Hannaford.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (with an icy
dialog: smile)
dialog: That's real nice, Jack -- coming from
dialog: you.
text: JAKE intervenes,
text: patching up a nasty
dialog: little moment between
dialog: 102
text: the two young directors.
text: Laughter and some
dialog: applause...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We’re all ruled by the wind, aren't
dialog: we, lady? So if the Lord is a lady,
dialog: and God's will is Her will -- then we
dialog: can relax, can’t we? And stop
dialog: expecting the universe to be logical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Thus spaketh Jake.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH is slightly
dialog: dazed by all this glib
text: recitation, but she makes
dialog: a quick, if slightly
text: lopsided recovery.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (indicating
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE )
dialog: And how does your disciple feel about
dialog: the new film --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (cutting this
dialog: subject off again)
dialog: He’s the apostle, lady.
dialog: (JAKE, of course, is
dialog: putting her on; and
text: OTTERLAKE plays up to
dialog: 103
dialog: it -- drawing, as usual,
dialog: on his powers of memory
dialog: and mimicry)
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Sure, just like St. Paul...
dialog: (aside to JAKE)
dialog: I know the lyrics for that one, too.
dialog: (in JAKE'S voice)
dialog: Paul was a big man, y'know. He put it
dialog: all together, packaged it --
dialog: (in his own
dialog: voice)
dialog: Sounds like a producer.
dialog: (as JAKE again)
dialog: Well, kid, he got the final cut.
dialog: Jesus was dead -- the subject was in
dialog: public domain when old Paul dreamed
dialog: up Christianity, and stuck then
dialog: “anity” into Christ --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: As long as I’m still twitching,
dialog: Brooksie -- you ain’t gonna stick it
dialog: into me.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH does not fail
dialog: to catch the veiled
dialog: aggression in this last...
dialog: 104
dialog: (During this last MAVIS,
text: OTTERLAKE’S young blonde
text: has tripped into scene
text: bearing a stiff drink
speaker_heading: for JAKE)
text: OTTERLAKE glances
text: quickly at JAKE...
text: who is smiling at
text: JULIE with an air
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (to JAKE)
dialog: Isn’t that just what he’s doing? ...
text: Otterlake’s new picture is breaking
dialog: the house record at the Music Hall,
dialog: and when his own production company
dialog: goes public, they say he’1ll walk
dialog: away with forty million dollars...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: And you'll say I stole it all from
dialog: Mr. Hannaford... I’1l never walk
dialog: away from that.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (sibylline)
dialog: Yes... you two have to stick together.
dialog: of perfect benevolence...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Please don’t tell us what you mean
dialog: by that.
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: JACK SIMON
dialog: (with a leer)
dialog: Whatever it means, you hadn’t ought
dialog: to be impertinent to an Apostle...
speaker_heading: MAVIS
dialog: (with some
dialog: petulance)
dialog: Hey, this is a drag -- how did we get
dialog: off into religion -- ?
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: To get away from movies.
speaker_heading: (back to JULIE)
dialog: The name of the game, lady.
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: (pouring a
dialog: little oil on
dialog: the troubled
dialog: waters)
dialog: We should get away from both. A
dialog: mystery should be left in peace.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: (a voice from the
dialog: outlying suburbs
dialog: of this group)
dialog: Mystery -- ?
dialog: Miss RICH thinks
dialog: she has a smart
dialog: answer to that one:
dialog: 106
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: Games are only fun till someone
dialog: loses.
speaker_heading: VOGEL
dialog: (irritated to find
dialog: himself so much
dialog: out of his depth)
dialog: What mystery?
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (smiling at
speaker_heading: MAVIS)
dialog: I’m a good loser, lady -- a lovely
dialog: loser.
speaker_heading: (to VOGEL)
dialog: Movies and friendship... those are
dialog: mysteries...
dialog: (was there just
text: a tiny sting in
dialog: the last?...
dialog: Anyway, his
dialog: tone brightens
dialog: abruptly)
dialog: And religion... The Baron’s into that
dialog: but also I know his material --
speaker_heading: (as THE BARON)
dialog: “A mystery may reveal, it never
dialog: explains.”
dialog: 107
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: Like Mr. Hannaford --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (quickly, brightly)
dialog: Right, sweetie. Just like me and God.
dialog: He started to go,
dialog: but turns back for the
dialog: curtain line:
dialog: If it weren’t for the difference of
dialog: sex, how could you tell us apart?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 108
speaker_heading: THE FILM
dialog: Continues...
dialog: And now, another interruption:
text: There is a low buzz of
dialog: interest as JAKE’S shadow is
text: cast upon the screen...
text: Drink in hand, he takes a
text: chair at the side of the
text: room and sits there watching...
text: From the SOUND-TRACK he can
text: hear his own voice (picked up
text: on the set by his own micro-
text: phone -- speaking from behind
dialog: his own camera) issuing
dialog: directions to the actors --
text: giving quiet but insultingly
dialog: obscene commands to the
text: actor JOHN DALE by way of
dialog: guiding the erotic action...
dialog: (The sequence is the one on the
text: rusty wreck of a bed in the
text: back-lot of the abandoned
dialog: movie studio)...
text: Suddenly a voice is heard in
dialog: the projection room itself:
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: (hoarsely vulgar)
dialog: We oughta be coming soon to
dialog: that shot where he walked off
dialog: The picture...
dialog: huh, Mr. Hannaford?...
dialog: 109
dialog: No reply to this from
dialog: JAKE...
speaker_heading: THE VOICE in the
dialog: audience persists --
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VOICE
dialog: Sure; they got it all on filn,
dialog: y‘know,... I was there; Jake went
dialog: right on cranking: the whole thing --
text: where he marches straight out of the
text: studio bare-assed...
dialog: Again, no comment from
dialog: JAKE...
text: And now, as he sits
dialog: watching it, we come to
dialog: that moment in the action
text: (THE GIRL’S scissors on
text: THE BOY’S hair) when JOHN
text: DALE jumps up off the bed,
text: strides through the mass of
dialog: movie equipment, off the
dialog: set and away...
text: JAKE'S VOICE can be heard
scene_heading: on the SOUND-TRACK (of the
dialog: FILM) ordering his camera-
dialog: men not to cut...
text: A wave of half stifled
dialog: laughter here in the
dialog: projection room accom-
dialog: panies this... Then a
dialog: 110
dialog: (contd. )
dialog: slightly embarrassed
dialog: silence...
text: Suddenly the screen
text: goes blank.
dialog: A pause...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Let’s keep going.
dialog: But nothing happens.
dialog: In the shadows we can just
text: make out JAKE as he turns
text: an inquiring look in the
text: direction of the projectionist.
text: Then the door opens...
dialog: But this time, no bright
text: light is thrown on the
dialog: screen. All lights, in
dialog: fact, have been turned off,
dialog: and what enters now through
text: the door is an immense comic
dialog: birthday cake -- a fabrication
text: of film cans crowned with a
dialog: perfect forest of kitchen
dialog: candles. “Ohs!” And “ahs!”
dialog: (rather campily) from the
dialog: crowd... THE BARON is in
dialog: charge of ceremonies (the
dialog: gag is clearly his)...
dialog: 111
text: Everyone gathers in a circle
text: around the mass of candles,
text: They are big kitchen candles,
dialog: far too numerous to blow out
dialog: in the traditional single
text: puff.
text: The buzz and chatter trails
text: away into silence...
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: Nobody was sure just how many
dialog: candles...

dialog: What for?
dialog: (Why is that faint shadow
dialog: of pain in JAKE'S eyes?)
scene_heading: INTER-CUT: JESSEL'S ATTEMPTED ORATION
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: (boringly raucous)
dialog: Better start blowing -- !
dialog: 112
speaker_heading: JACK SIMON
dialog: Think you can make it, Hannaford?
text: JAKE has caught JULIE'S
dialog: eye...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Take a lotta blowing -- I’d say it’s
dialog: a job for Miss Rich. She’ll huff and
dialog: she’ll puff, and she’ll blow the house
dialog: down --
text: JULIE, exchanging looks
text: with JAKE, takes a puff
dialog: at the candles -- none
dialog: go out.
dialog: Laughter... Everybody
text: starts blowing...
dialog: Finally the last candle
text: is out.
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: Okay, let’s get back to the film...
dialog: A PAUSE...
dialog: Nothing happens.
dialog: Has something happened
dialog: to the machine?
dialog: No, it’s a black-out --
dialog: The whole ranch is in
dialog: 
dialog: darkness.

dialog: himself. Your idea of him: the
dialog: bullfights and the big game -- the
dialog: whole macho bit...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK SIMON
dialog: The truth is, as a macho he ain’t all
dialog: that much. He just likes be with
dialog: ‘em. That chest ain’t near as hairy
dialog: as he’d like you to think. Your
dialog: guy’s a big, pink lobster -- nothing’s
dialog: really tough except the shell.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Now what...? I ask you what’s so
dialog: tough about you -- and you ask me
dialog: if I wouldn’t like to find out; and

speaker_heading: JACK SIMON
dialog: If that’s how you want it, kid.

dialog: (with equally surprising

dialog: She gave me the book.
speaker_heading: ZARAH

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And spoilt the present by

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (turning back to

dialog: You chop away all the same...
text: A month's silence.
dialog: Half a man is better than

dialog: Who told you I was broke?
dialog: 124
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Well... Billy said you’ve lost
dialog: the boat --
dialog: For a moment there’s
text: a baleful look in JAKE’s
text: eye as he looks up from
text: his drink.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: He did, did he...?
dialog: How about the roof over my

speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE
text: Out in the snow, kid -- over

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Less than the dust, kid, from my

dialog: You’1l never catch up with me.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: That’s what I’m told...
text: JAKE raises his eyes to
dialog: him... OTTERLAKE may have
dialog: expected some slight
dialog: acknowledgement of this
dialog: delicate compliment, but
text: JAKE'’s look is curiously
text: withdrawn, and almost sly.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Cute... very cute.

dialog: And you -- ?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (startled)
dialog: Jake! I just told you...
speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: (plaintively)
dialog: Hey, can I please get myself
dialog: something to eat?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Didn't they feed you, Joey?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: All they do on airplanes is feed you.
speaker_heading: FRANKL
dialog: Turbulence...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (cheerfully)
dialog: You threw up? Give him some candy,

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: I didn’t “collect” the teacher, Jake,
dialog: he met me at the screening --
text: He stops. He knows
dialog: the answer...
text: AL is behind him.
dialog: 130
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (quickly, quietly)
dialog: With Max -- ?
speaker_heading: FRANKL
dialog: Look, Jake, those oil guys, they

dialog: Max David -- ?
speaker_heading: FRANKL
dialog: That dirty crook -- who needs him?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: We do...

speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Max? -- he’s so crooked he’s got
text: rubber pockets so he can steal soup.
text: He looks around -- not
dialog: really hoping for a
dialog: laugh and certainly,
dialog: not getting it...
text: They turn to find him
dialog: standing nearby...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Our best chance was that oil money...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: And Otterlake -- what about him?
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Yes, what about me?
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: (a lightning quick
dialog: cover-up)

speaker_heading: BILLY

dialog: Well, we don’t have everything...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (smoothly)
dialog: Leave it to Jake. Pretty soon you'll
dialog: have too much.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You bet! We’ve had our troubles
dialog: before...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (arranging an
dialog: exit)

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Could be it’s softening your brain,
dialog: Uncle.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It's for the sugar... Since I got
dialog: off that stuff...
text: His eye is on JAKE’s
dialog: drink... his anger
dialog: makes it possible
dialog: to screw up his
dialog: courage and mention
dialog: a very delicate
dialog: matter:
dialog: And speaking of which...
dialog: JAKE (who knows BILLY
dialog: is about to be censor-
dialog: ious about the liquor)
dialog: cuts in swiftly
dialog: knocking him off
dialog: balance:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Wasn’t very smart, y’know -- poor-
text: mouthing like that in front of
dialog: Otterlake. Know who he is, Billy?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Of course I do -- I’ve seen his
dialog: pictures --
speaker_heading: FRANKL
dialog: Big hits, both of ‘em --
dialog: 135
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (to MATT)
dialog: Tell him who he is, Uncle.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Brooksie’s old man owns half the
dialog: trees in Canada.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And y'know what Billy told him? He
dialog: told him we’re in trouble.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Well, aren’t we?
text: JAKE turns back to give
dialog: him another steady,
text: almost pitying look.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (very patiently)
dialog: When we talk poor to the rich,
text: William, they jump to conclusions.
dialog: They think we’re getting ready for
dialog: a touch.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: And that’s what we're doing?

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Well, horray for you.
speaker_heading: PISTER
dialog: Well, he’s bound to feel some
dialog: gratitude --
speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: (gently, friendly
dialog: -- but with a

dialog: severity)
dialog: We don’t hustle our chums for dough,

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: PISTER
dialog: Excuse me, but... didn’t I just hear

speaker_heading: JAKE
speaker_heading: (patting PISTER
dialog: gently on the
dialog: cheek)
dialog: Always remember... that your heart

speaker_heading: PISTER
dialog: No...

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: PISTER

speaker_heading: BILLY
text: He also teaches dramatics.
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oscar?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (with a leer)
dialog: Tell about Aunt Daisy -- with the
dialog: funny hats.
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS is becoming

dialog: What’s the point of this?

speaker_heading: (to MAGGIE)
dialog: And the way Dale tells it, he didn’t
dialog: even want to be an actor...
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Sure; that was supposedly Jake's
dialog: idea -- He practically forced him...
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS’ VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Down there in Acapulco...?
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Yes, what was he doing? I mean,
dialog: besides getting stoned --
dialog: to

speaker_heading: C.U. BURROUGHS (CONT'D)
dialog: Affection for his old

text: BURROUGHS, increasingly
dialog: uneasy about all these

text: his lips.
dialog: The story concerns my school: I’m
dialog: in no position to publish abroad a
dialog: petty --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (over-lap)
dialog: Publish and be damned, Doctor. Look
dialog: -- they’ve run out of film -- you can
dialog: speak off the record...
text: This last is accompanied by
text: a quick glance (almost a
dialog: wink!) Into the lens of the
dialog: second camera which is
dialog: following...
dialog: A brief silence --
dialog: 144
text: BURROUGHS is still flushed
dialog: with the excitement of
dialog: being the center of all
dialog: this attention, but by now
dialog: he’s feeling quite nervous
dialog: about the particular turn
dialog: this multi-media interview
text: is taking.
text: JAKE gives him his
dialog: steady “man to man”
dialog: look: (A good
dialog: equivalent to the
text: straight arm on the
dialog: shoulder).
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: Dale himself was in no way involved;
dialog: but among the boys, there was a good
dialog: deal of morbid conversation, I’m
text: afraid, on unhealthy subjects. As
dialog: you can imagine -- the name
dialog: “Oscar”...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (in a tone of the most
dialog: perfect warmth and
dialog: understanding)
dialog: What happened to that teacher?
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: We let him go, of course.
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: (still gently, but
dialog: closing the trap)
dialog: Let him go? What about the police?
dialog: 145
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: (startled)
dialog: The police? The poor man was sick,
dialog: Mr. Hannaford.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Those young boys -- they weren't sick
dialog: when he finished with ‘em?
dialog: (hardening)
dialog: That’s a prison offense, isn’t it --
dialog: How many minors do you have to
dialog: corrupt?
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: I hope you’re not worried about
dialog: Dale...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You think I should be?
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: Wouldn’t that depend, Mr. Hannaford,
dialog: on your own personal interest?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (after a very short
dialog: beat)
dialog: What are you driving at, Burroughs?
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: Why, nothing...
dialog: 146
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: I’m just his director, not his Aunt
dialog: Daisy.
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: And I’m just his English teacher!
dialog: (a self-conscious
dialog: little laugh)
text: JAKE looks at him
dialog: for a moment... (He’s
dialog: allowed the scene to
dialog: get a little out of
dialog: control; now he’s
dialog: going to get back on
dialog: top).
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (with the Hannaford
dialog: smile)
dialog: Right!
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: (pulling himself
dialog: together)
dialog: But certainly, he has every reason to
dialog: be grateful to you...
dialog: (archly)
dialog: And I’m sure that some day, when one
dialog: of his fine performances gets the
dialog: Academy Award, you'll be grateful
text: to him.
dialog: 147
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (straight into camera)
dialog: Notice how careful he is not to refer
dialog: to it as an “Oscar.”
speaker_heading: (back to BURROUGHS)
dialog: Doctor, would you care for a dip?
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: A dip...? In the pool? What a
dialog: grand suggestion!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (turning away)
dialog: A little more hootch should be
dialog: helpful -- I’1l be right with you.
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: Good... Good. And where do I change?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (turning back)
text: Here, Dr. Burroughs, in the sight of
dialog: God; I won’t even peek.
speaker_heading: BURROUGHS
dialog: (absorbing this)
dialog: Yes...I suppose all school teachers

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I suppose so. Prigs and queers.

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: She doesn’t know the latest...
speaker_heading: (to ZARAH)
dialog: Remember the way they met -- when
text: Jake pulled Mr. John Dale out of the
dialog: water? The famous would-be suicide --
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: Would-be suicides ought to be treated
dialog: like drunks.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (breaking in)
dialog: Would-be suicide, hell: --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I was conned, Mother, it was a fake --
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: And it turns out that he doesn’t
dialog: belong to you?
dialog: 150
text: JAKE'’s smile goes a
text: little blank.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (antagonized)
dialog: Belong -- ?
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: The old Chinese business, remember?
dialog: You save a life -- you own that life.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Finder keepers?
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: Do you care?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Care? We’re free for a change, eh,
dialog: Uncle Bill...? Now we’ll have some
dialog: fun.
text: BILLY smiles gratefully...
dialog: MAGGIE is irritated:
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
speaker_heading: (to ZARAH)
dialog: Jake isn’t a Chinaman --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: “Chinese,” Maggie -- No, and the kid
dialog: wasn’t a suicide. He was... an actor.
dialog: 151
dialog: He makes the last word
text: sound obscene... ZARAH
text: can’t help but notice
text: that his eyes are glazed
dialog: to avoid scrutiny, he
text: steps behind a screen
text: and finishes undressing...
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: (cutting her off)
dialog: We don’t own people.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He wasn’t drowning -- he was
dialog: auditioning.
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: Or disown them. That boy didn’t run
dialog: away from you. He was thrown away.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: And sweet Holy Jesus, what a relief!
dialog: Like getting rid of a bad tooth --
dialog: Right, Jake?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: A monkey on my back --
text: He has stepped out from
text: behind the screen (dressed
text: now in a terry-cloth bath-
dialog: robe)... ZARAH’s look has
dialog: stopped him.
dialog: That means a drug habit, in case you
dialog: didn’t know, Mother... Sure --
dialog: something you gotta kick. And my foot
dialog: was getting sore...
dialog: 152
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: How will you finish it?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Finish what? He’s all washed up,
dialog: Mother --
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: The picture... Isn’t that what
dialog: matters?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We'll finish it; eh, Maggie?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Without the kid?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: We do have that footage of him

speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: We're all... interested.
dialog: (another beat)
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: He wasn’t.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: Neither are you... She doesn’t
dialog: interest you at all. Funny, isn’t
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
text: A scream.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: I mean, look at the record -- the big
dialog: starmaker’s never been so big
dialog: females --
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: (holding up a
dialog: length of iron
dialog: pipe)
dialog: Present for you... Not from me --
dialog: Zimmer. There’s a card.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (his back turned,
text: his eyes on ZARAH)
dialog: Zimmie? We oughta have a drink with
dialog: Zimmie...
dialog: 154
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: You fired him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I always fire him.
dialog: (turning to THE
speaker_heading: BARON)
dialog: Anyway, on my birthday I give the
dialog: presents.
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: It's some kind of gag --
dialog: (he sighs)
dialog: We know... You make the gags, too.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (looking at the pipe)
dialog: He tells me where I can stick it?
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: It's for those plastic John Dales
dialog: that he made for you.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: Things would have been different,
dialog: wouldn’t they, if Dale had been her
dialog: lover -- ?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (looking in at the
dialog: door )
dialog: I got an early day, Zarah, it’s been
dialog: a lovely party...
dialog: 155
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
text: (still zooming in on
speaker_heading: JAKE)
dialog: You couldn’t manage that -- It rather
dialog: spoils the pattern, doesn’t it?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What’s this pattern shit?
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: The big boss can tell you -- he knows
dialog: how it goes -- How it’s supposed to
dialog: go...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Well, I’m going home -- What’s that
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (half to herself,
dialog: angrily turning
dialog: away )
dialog: Zimmie's jokes -- !
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Speaking of presents...
dialog: JAKE has been rummaging
text: in a drawer. He brings
text: something out and, turning
text: with it, is haulted again by
text: MATT’s voice reading from
dialog: ZIMMER'’s “birthday card”:
dialog: 156
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (reading)
dialog: “Have a go at the dummies, Jake --
dialog: they break even more easily than
dialog: people.”
text: After a moment’s pause,
text: JAKE turns again and
dialog: moves out to --
speaker_heading: THE BIG ROOM
scene_heading: INTERCUT: REACTION SHOT
scene_heading: (INCLUDING THE ACTRESS)
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (making an
dialog: announcement )
dialog: Gentlemen -- and Ladies...
dialog: The clot of cameras
text: thickens quickly around
dialog: him...
dialog: We're presenting an award...
text: To the other half of “The Other Side
dialog: Of The Wind”... the better half.
text: A glint of alcohol in
text: his eye, he moves toward
text: THE ACTRESS.
dialog: A bone for Pocohontas...
text: The crowd watches in
dialog: uneasy silence (THE
dialog: ACTRESS very cool)...
text: He pauses for effect.
text: His eyes move to THE
dialog: ACTRESS.
dialog: 157
speaker_heading: JAKE (contd. )
dialog: A little curio we picked up somewhere
dialog: -- A bit of our own palefaced
dialog: craftsmanship: an Indian bone...
text: The inscription goes back before all
dialog: this was movie country. Just after
text: the gold was found. The redskin
dialog: population dropped pretty quickly
dialog: then -- ten years and ninety thousand
dialog: of ‘em just... disappeared. Well,
dialog: in those good old days, our gallant
dialog: honkey pioneers used to cut themselves
text: some heads off Indian skulls and
dialog: pickle the ears in whisky for
dialog: souvenirs --
dialog: And on bones, like this one, they
dialog: liked to write cute little jokes --
dialog: (reading the
dialog: inscription)
dialog: “I am off the reservation at last.”
dialog: And so you are, my dear...
text: He lays the bone down on
text: a table next to her quite
dialog: gently, and speaks quite
dialog: lightly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: We thought you might want to give
dialog: this to your leading man -- right up
dialog: his ass.

scene_heading: SERIES OF SHORT SCENES (IMPROVISED)
dialog: Between carious types... including
dialog: some notable celebrities. All this
dialog: (like everything else) is recorded
dialog: by the documentary camera-crew,
dialog: and also video-freaks)...
text: As the party continues, the
dialog: generation gap is underscored
text: by the choice of intoxicants.
text: Guests anywhere near HANNAFORD’s
dialog: age are, of course, mostly on
text: booze... JAKE himself is quietly
text: putting it away in fairly Homeric
dialog: quantities...
dialog: At this stage, he certainly isn’t
dialog: sober.
text: (THE DWARVES are frankly drunk)...
dialog: 159
speaker_heading: THE GUN ROOM
dialog: 
text: A fine array of trophies, a
dialog: magnificent gun collection and
dialog: many framed photographs (groups
dialog: on safari and convivial gatherings
text: aboard the Hannaford yacht).
text: AL is studying one of the pictures.
text: It shows a handsome young man
text: tensely profiled in front of some
text: battered targets and clay pigeons.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Who’s the joker with the cigarette?
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: Miguel -- He was the best of all.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Best of what?
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: Our bullfighters, right, Jake? We
dialog: followed him for a while all over
dialog: Spain.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: (to JAKE, who has
dialog: just entered with
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE )
dialog: That’s you, aiming the gun at him in
dialog: the shooting gallery...
dialog: 160
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Another birthday, kid. And what a
dialog: party that was -- No movie buffs or
dialog: bums, no spies or spooks. Just paid-
text: up members of The Club.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: (reading the sign-
dialog: ture on the photo)
dialog: Miguel Ortega?
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: The best.
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: Didn't he get killed?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (grinning as he
dialog: continues to
dialog: study the
dialog: photograph)
dialog: I hope you weren’t responsible for
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I just got that one shot at him,
dialog: Brooksie, and I missed.
dialog: 161
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: CBut he got the cigarette.
dialog: (he starts out
dialog: the door)
dialog: There was never any braver.
speaker_heading: AL
speaker_heading: (following THE BARON)
text: Not in a shooting gallery.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No, he didn’t look too good in there.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: I guess he didn’t quite trust you --
text: (he breaks off,
dialog: with a quick
dialog: change of tone)
dialog: Drop that gun, Skipper.
dialog: JAKE has indeed, picked
text: out a rifle from his gun
dialog: collection.
dialog: If you're planning to celebrate this
dialog: birthday on me just --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: This is the one that hurts,
dialog: Brooksie...
dialog: (OTTERLAKE is so good at
dialog: dead-panning a gag that we
dialog: almost wonder if he does
dialog: imagine the old man is
dialog: proposing some sort of
dialog: lunatic duel?)
dialog: 162
text: JAKE looks up at him,
dialog: as the young director
text: rises abruptly to his
dialog: feet.
dialog: Silence...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Skipper --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: This is the scene we both hoped that
dialog: we'd never get to. And I don’t think
dialog: it’s going to play. Not even for
dialog: comedy.
text: He raises the gun and
text: sights along it,
text: pointing out the window
text: --. He pulls the trigger.
text: It clicks. The gun is
text: empty. He lowers it,
dialog: and turns, faintly
text: smiling to OTTERLAKE...
text: A short silence... Then:
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: How much longer do you need?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How much longer have you got?
text: OTTERLAKE tries to
dialog: answer...
text: JAKE gets up and leans
dialog: the gun against the
dialog: wall.
dialog: Silence...
dialog: Silence...
dialog: 163
speaker_heading: JAKE (contd. )
dialog: Hey -- remember when you first
dialog: appeared on that location of mine
dialog: up in Bolivia? What is it -- just
dialog: three years ago?
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (forcing a
dialog: chuckle)
dialog: I didn’t even have the fare back home,
text: just a second-hand tape recorder that
dialog: I couldn’t work --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: A raggedy-ass kid...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Skipper...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: That forty million that was
dialog: mentioned...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I know, kid; let me finish your line
dialog: for you. It’s still only a distant
dialog: hope...
dialog: How’s that for dialogue?
dialog: 164
text: He grins at him and moves
text: into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE
dialog: (from the bathroom)
dialog: You might just lean a little on Max
dialog: David... You do the leaning, he’s
dialog: gotta give.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: I did set up the screening --
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE
dialog: So you did... He hated every frame --
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: He was confused...
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: He’s an idiot, Jake. You know that.
dialog: They're all idiots.
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE
dialog: He’s your idiot.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Up to a point.
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE
dialog: Don’t be pompous, kid...
dialog: Not that I don’t understand. You
dialog: made the company all that loot.
dialog: Christ knows I didn’t.
dialog: 165
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Don’t think I’m not going to put up
dialog: a fight about it. I will.
text: JAKE comes to the door.
text: JAKE looks at him...
dialog: He starts raising
dialog: the gun...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But you don’t want to.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: I don’t want to have to listen to
dialog: Max and the rest of those stupid
dialog: sods turning you down...
dialog: We'll find a way... You know that,
dialog: don’t you?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Don’t give up the ship, Davey...?
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: I’m not -- !
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Didn't I tell you -- ? This scene
dialog: will never play...
dialog: 166
text: THE ROW OF DUMMIES ON THE ROCKS
dialog: (placed earlier in neat
dialog: arrangement by ZIMMER)...
text: The head of one of them is

dialog: Firing...
speaker_heading: THE TERRACE
text: THE ACTRESS sits alone on one of
dialog: them. (We are across the pool from

dialog: gun room. )
text: HIGGAM enters scene.
speaker_heading: HIGGAM
dialog: (out of sorts)
dialog: I’ve been looking for you...
text: She turns to look at him.
speaker_heading: HIGGAM (contd. )
dialog: Your boss sent me --

scene_heading: TWO SHOT FAVORING HIGGAM:
text: Holding out a gun...
speaker_heading: THE ACTRESS
dialog: Another present?
speaker_heading: HIGGAM
dialog: How do I know? He just told me that
dialog: he thinks you’1l know how to use it.
dialog: Rising and taking the
text: gun from him, she looks
dialog: dangerous... HIGGAM
text: beats a hasty retreat.
text: She then raises the gun,
dialog: turning to aim it
text: directly away from the
text: row of dummies...
text: JAKE'S AT THE WINDOW
text: His eyes are on THE ACTRESS
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (from a place of
dialog: safety)
dialog: Who’s she aiming at?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Me.
text: A shot rings out, and
dialog: the lantern nearest to
text: JAKE shatters to pieces.
dialog: 168
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Hey -- !
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (falling into the
dialog: hammy style of
dialog: their game)
dialog: Otterlake -- we never should have
dialog: issued firearms to the natives.
dialog: Another shot! And
text: another lantern breaks.
dialog: The group is practically
text: blacked out.
speaker_heading: THE ACTRESS
dialog: 
text: She turns her gun slightly,
dialog: taking careful aim --

speaker_heading: ZARAH VALESKA
dialog: Jake’s done that already.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: Suddenly --
text: Out of the blackness, a bolt of bright raspberry colored
dialog: lightning (!!!) Reveals the Hannaford Ranch, the Western
text: landscape surrounding it, and DR. BURROUGHS, crouched
text: behind cactus, a trembling nude... The scattered dummies
text: on the rocks look like an over-exposed negative of some
dialog: unthinkable massacre...
text: The lightning changes color -- luridly, repeatedly, and the
text: night is hideously assaulted with noise.
text: What has commenced, of course, is a display of fireworks.
text: An important display -- if a bit in spirit... Guests are
dialog: surprised in various attitudes and positions...
dialog: 170
dialog: A mighty boom (!!!)
dialog: from some larger and

speaker_heading: AL

speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE

speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: Close -- very close.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Too late now, he got away from

dialog: 179
text: He turns... and moves

speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE (contd. )
dialog: And what the hell is that
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: The farther you’re apart,

speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Now what could we be hiding

speaker_heading: JULIE RICH

speaker_heading: AL

dialog: 183
dialog: A title:
speaker_heading: MEANWHILE ——
text: BACK AT THE RANCH ...
text: A flashlight’s beam, crossing
dialog: a few remnant patches of the
dialog: birthday party, has come to
text: rest on a piece of black
text: illustration board. Upon this,
text: in the style of an old silent
dialog: movie title, some wit has
dialog: scrawled the words we've just
dialog: been reading...
dialog: We are, indeed, back the ranch,
dialog: and in --
speaker_heading: THE BIG ROOM
dialog: 
text: Among the litter, an idle scattering
dialog: of photographers are still idiotically
text: photographing each other... The guests
text: are stoned, discursive of both.
text: Somebody snatches the illustration
dialog: board from somebody else.
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: “Hey, who gave you that?
dialog: It’s part of the story board.”
dialog: "The what?”
dialog: "Come on -- I’1l show you...”
text: THE “STORY BOARD ROOM”
dialog: We've been in this room before --
dialog: 184
scene_heading: THE “STORY BOARD ROOM” (CONT'D)
dialog: -- caught glimpses of the drawings
text: on the wall during one or another
text: of the lamp-lit conversations...
text: The sketches are for set-ups to
text: be photographed for HANNAFORD’S
text: FILM. These illustrate the action...
text: INTERCUT CLOSE SHOTS of these are
text: INTERCUT with the FILM itself
text: (being shown on the screen of the
dialog: drive-in-theatre) and with the
text: following dialogue...
text: From a tape recorder comes an
text: unaccompanied Flamenco lament.
text: MAGGIE and BILLY are doing their
dialog: valiant best to explain their
text: sketches to a small group of
dialog: truth-seekers.
speaker_heading: HIGGAM’S VOICE
dialog: --. This old man is hiding -- spying
dialog: on her?
speaker_heading: AL'S VOICE
text: Yes, but then she chases him,
dialog: remember?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE’S VOICE
text: He finally holes up in some
dialog: old wreck of a movie prop --
speaker_heading: PAT’S VOICE
dialog: (breaking in)
dialog: And now she’s pushing all this crazy
dialog: shit around, you see -- trying to
dialog: close the guy in, when a whole lot
dialog: more of it collapses --
dialog: 185
speaker_heading: BILLY’S VOICE
dialog: That’s being worked out.
speaker_heading: PAT’S VOICE
dialog: So now this character is trapped --
speaker_heading: AL'S VOICE
dialog: But then we hear his voice --
speaker_heading: HIGGAM'S VOICE
dialog: The singing?
speaker_heading: PAT’S VOICE
dialog: Old Manolito -- Jake always tries to
dialog: get him a job.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (on camera)
dialog: But he won’t play the part --
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (on camera)
dialog: It won't be any midget, either.
speaker_heading: PISTER
dialog: (the intelligent
dialog: truth-seeker)
dialog: But who is he?
dialog: 186
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: See the movie...
speaker_heading: THE FILM:
speaker_heading: The VOICES continue
dialog: off-screen:
speaker_heading: PISTER
dialog: What does he represent?
speaker_heading: PAT
dialog: Aw, just some screwy old squatters out
dialog: there in the back-lot of a studio --
speaker_heading: DELLA
dialog: But what’s he doing in the story -- ?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You’1l have to ask Mr. Hannaford.
speaker_heading: JACQUELINE
dialog: But will he tell us?
dialog: Silence...
speaker_heading: THE FILM continues:
speaker_heading: (THE ACTRESS on the
dialog: screen alone)...
speaker_heading: JACQUELINE’S VOICE
dialog: How about asking her -- ?
speaker_heading: HANNAFORD’S_ FILM
dialog: Continues...
dialog: 187
speaker_heading: PISTER’S VOICE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: What if... he’s Hannaford --
dialog: Hannaford himself?
speaker_heading: BILLY'S VOICE
dialog: Don’t be nuts.
text: INTERCUT: THE FILM ITSELF AND VARIOUS GROUPS WATCHING IT.
dialog: Sometimes we can see these
dialog: people -- mostly they are
text: voices over THE FILM...
dialog: We are in --
scene_heading: THE DRIVE-IN THEATRE
speaker_heading: HIGGAM'S VOICE
dialog: Let’s back up a little -- The wind
text: it’s blowing the old movie set to
dialog: pieces.
speaker_heading: DANNY'S VOICE
dialog: The whole world maybe...
dialog: 188
speaker_heading: KLEE’S VOICE
dialog: (over-lap)
dialog: It's just a wrecking job, there were
dialog: machines --
speaker_heading: ROGER’S VOICE
dialog: And what about that blood on her...?
speaker_heading: KLEE’S VOICE
dialog: Blood?
speaker_heading: OSSIE’S VOICE
dialog: Her body --
scene_heading: BLACK CINEASTE’S VOICE
dialog: Whatever we're supposed to think,
dialog: there’s death in it...
scene_heading: THE BARON’S VOICE
dialog: My dear fellow...
scene_heading: BLACK CINEASTE’S VOICE
dialog: Man, that’s all it is -- death it’s
dialog: just purely what he’s all about --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A_GROUP_ GATHERED AROUND THE BLACK CINEASTE’S CAR...
speaker_heading: BLACK CINEASTE
dialog: (on camera)
dialog: Like Simon says, under the shell he’s
dialog: all mushy...
dialog: 189
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: That’s mushy talk, brother.
scene_heading: THE BLACK CINEASTE
dialog: (to the others,
speaker_heading: indicating THE BARON)
dialog: Who’s he?
scene_heading: ANOTHER CINEASTE
dialog: (pink)
dialog: “The Baron” -- That’s what they call
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: OSSIE
dialog: Well, he is a baron.
speaker_heading: KLEE
dialog: And he’s on all the credits for Jake’s
dialog: screenplays.
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: (ice-cool, with no
dialog: trace of self-pity)
dialog: I muse Mr. Hannaford. He has curious
dialog: pleasures --
speaker_heading: OSSIE
dialog: Oh? We'd like to hear some more about
dialog: those curious pleasures...
dialog: 190
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: Games. He likes to play games...
dialog: I am a writer who stopped writing one
dialog: afternoon in Budapest in nineteen
dialog: twenty nine. Do I have a camera?
dialog: All through the evening
dialog: people have been
dialog: forgetting the cameras,
dialog: or trying to, or pretend-
dialog: ing to try... Now THE
text: BARON is actually looking
dialog: for one.
dialog: I am prepared to make a limited
dialog: declaration.
text: (he pauses, getting
dialog: his thoughts
dialog: together)
dialog: This famous... old lion of yours --
dialog: he is not what you think, you know.
speaker_heading: OSSIE
dialog: Who called him a lion for God’s sake?
speaker_heading: JACQUELINE
dialog: Lions are cats. Chabrol says he’s a
dialog: cat --
speaker_heading: CHABROL
text: Jake is a cat that walks like a bear.
dialog: 191
speaker_heading: BLACK CINEASTE
dialog: Or a lobster -- ? That walks like a
dialog: crab, sidewise...
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: You made the mask. Tear it off now
dialog: and what will you find? -- Another
dialog: mask. Or your own face...
speaker_heading: OSSIE
dialog: Another mask?
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: Your own face, perhaps.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: A trick -- done with mirrors... Sorry
dialog: go on, Baron. What’s the answer?
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: A magician doesn’t give any answers --
speaker_heading: THE BARON
dialog: I’d call him a necromancer.
dialog: But I do not know if he has raised
dialog: the dead.
scene_heading: THE DRIVE-IN
dialog: 192
text: JAKE, in the sports car,
text: sits watching the FILM...
text: OTTERLAKE, standing not far
text: away, turns to another car,
text: as it pulls to a stop...
dialog: Silence...
text: The FILM continues...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (indicating the
dialog: screen)
dialog: Dad's done it again, hasn’t he?
dialog: "Be-dimm'd the noon-tide sun;
text: Call’d forth the mutinous winds.
dialog: By his so potent art...
dialog: But this... rough magic He here
dialog: abjures --"
dialog: (change of tone)
dialog: Take back the last: it doesn’t
dialog: fit...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What does “abjure” mean? You
dialog: went to Harvard.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: “Give-up -- “
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That’s a suggestion?
dialog: 193
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: “Abjure” -- give up... he knows
dialog: what it means.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I gave up on the seventh grade.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Never. Not even then... And I
dialog: didn’t learn my Shakespeare in
dialog: Harvard.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Mr. Otterfield wanted to be an actor --
dialog: Then he saw one of my movies --
dialog: We all read the interview...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: It can also be stated that we aren’t
dialog: breaking any magic wands...
dialog: (No reaction from the listening
dialog: group in the car.)
dialog: Wands... You’ve heard the Baron on
dialog: that subject? “Every man needs
dialog: two -- his own and a good one.”
dialog: He’ll be hanging onto his for awhile
dialog: longer --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hang onto your own, baby -- just for
dialog: once.
text: A long silence...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 194
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (camping)
dialog: He is a rough magician, isn’t he?
dialog: What did I do wrong, Daddy?
dialog: “Our revels now are ended..."?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You bet your sweet cheeks.
dialog: 195
speaker_heading: THE ACTRESS
dialog: 
text: She sits alone, watching
dialog: the film...
scene_heading: (INTERCUT: THE FILM)
speaker_heading: JAKE'S CAR
text: JULIETTE RICH has nudged her way
text: past OTTERLAKE and stands next to
text: JAKE, who sits still at the wheel
text: of his open car...
text: She stands there looking at him...
text: There has been the muted noise of an
text: expensive car coming to a stop. (Per-
dialog: haps we caught a glimpse of it in the
dialog: background)...
text: Now, suddenly, JULIE RICH starts back,
text: startled, as JAKE, with that feline
dialog: agility of his which can be so sur-
text: prising, jumps out of the car.
text: The last lurking CAMERA CREW follows
text: him as he moves over to:
speaker_heading: ZARAH'S CAR
dialog: 
text: THE FILM’S sound-track fills the pause
dialog: as these two legendary figures, these
dialog: famous friends confront each other...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hey, Beautiful...
dialog: 196
dialog: The banal words of the
dialog: greeting seem to carry
dialog: the vibration of many
dialog: years of affectionate
dialog: repitition.
speaker_heading: JAKE (contd. )
dialog: Going so soon...?
text: ZARAH doesn’t speak.
dialog: Wasn’t much fun for you, was it...?
dialog: --. Goddam midgets...
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: They’re friends of yours?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Just brought ‘em along for laughs,
dialog: Mother.
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Casting call... Some cockamamy
dialog: notion that the Old Man oughta be a
dialog: dwarf. In the movie... Don’t
dialog: you think it’s better if we never
dialog: see him?
text: Her eyes have gone to the
dialog: distant screen...
dialog: For a moment we share her
dialog: viewpoint:
dialog: 197
dialog: Then --
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE:
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: That goes for us all, doesn’t it --
dialog: all the old men...
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: JAKE waits... ZARAH
text: makes no comment.
dialog: Now he makes a sour
dialog: little joke (a faint
dialog: note of something close
dialog: to defensiveness which
dialog: we've never heard from
dialog: him before).
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Heard but not seen, huh? And for
dialog: the sex department... work quickly
dialog: and always in the dark.
text: He realizes that this has
dialog: fallen very flat... even
text: before he’s aware that
text: OTTERLAKE is standing at
dialog: his side.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (comic Japanese)
dialog: So sorry, Sarah --
dialog: (as himself)
dialog: I’m afraid our leader is a little
dialog: pissed.
dialog: 198
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: She doesn’t like you, kid: that’s
dialog: why she gave the party. She doesn’t
dialog: figure I get quite enough exposure
dialog: from the younger generation just from
dialog: you...
dialog: But I do, you know. I get quite
dialog: enough.
text: A short, tense silence...
text: Then OTTERLAKE turns and
dialog: leaves...
dialog: Silence again between
dialog: these two...
dialog: And now, in the FILM, the
text: lamenting wind is conquered
text: by the song of the OLD MAN...
speaker_heading: JAKE (contd. )
dialog: That's old Manolito. We found him
dialog: together... In Spain, remember...?
text: She goes on listening for
dialog: just a while longer to the
dialog: old gypsies’ song...
dialog: Hey, beautiful, couldn’t we fix it
dialog: to see each other just a little bit
dialog: less seldom.
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: With an old friend, it’s quite enough
dialog: to feel he’s there -- like Gibraltar
dialog: or the Eiffel Tower...
dialog: 
dialog: JAKE absorbs this for
dialog: moment. Then she
dialog: continues:
dialog: 199
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Thanks, Mother...
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: Durability -- it can be rather
dialog: fragile.
dialog: Sometimes, to keep that feeling we
dialog: need to keep our distance.
dialog: a
dialog: The bad thing is to find out that a
dialog: friendship was between a couple of
dialog: other people.
dialog: Say goodnight for me to your actress.
scene_heading: INTERCUT: THE ACTRESS
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (still trying to
dialog: keep it bright)
dialog: She’s not too happy with us, either...
dialog: Well -- she was pretty good in there
text: with the gun.
dialog: 200
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: She didn’t shoot at the dummies --
text: JAKE doesn’t turn at
dialog: her approach: he goes
text: on looking at ZARAH.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (the faint, hopeful
dialog: smile is still frozen
text: on his face -- but no
dialog: smile is in his voice)
dialog: The preferred target, I guess, would
dialog: have been me.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: Preferred by you, Mr. Hannaford?
text: A short, ugly pause...
dialog: Then:
dialog: You gave her the gun...
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: (suddenly
dialog: exasperated)
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: (Whatever has happened to
dialog: her feelings about JAKE,
dialog: here is a rat of a women,
dialog: deserving nothing, on whom
dialog: she can allow a bit of
dialog: pressure to escape).
dialog: What’s it supposed to mean?
dialog: 201
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (ruefully)
dialog: Don’t worry, even if she doesn’t
dialog: know, she’1l tell us.
dialog: (For just this moment, we’re
dialog: encouraged to believe that
dialog: the young lady critic has
dialog: nothing to say... But we’re
dialog: wrong)
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (speaking gently
dialog: and quickly)
dialog: Miss Valeska, you made just one
dialog: picture with Hannaford?
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: (blank)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: Garvey was your leading man. Glen
dialog: Garvey... It is true, isn’t it, that
dialog: during the shooting, Hannaford had an
dialog: affair with Garvey’s wife?
speaker_heading: ZARAH
dialog: (after a short, deadly
dialog: pause)
dialog: We'll have to stop this, you know.
dialog: This last refers to the
scene_heading: DOCUMENTARY CAMERA CREW
dialog: (of whose busy presence
dialog: she has been increasingly
dialog: aware).
dialog: 202
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH
dialog: (rapidly building to
dialog: her climax, her
text: eyes still riveted
speaker_heading: on JAKE)
dialog: Men are the subject of his movies --
dialog: Whoever the man is, naturally, he has
text: a woman -- Whoever she is -- somehow,
text: finally, Hannaford seduces her. He
dialog: must. He must possess her. That way,
dialog: he possesses him...
speaker_heading: BILLY'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: Okay, okay... Cut it, you guys --
dialog: That’s just what happens:
dialog: the film (the documentary
dialog: film of this action) ends,
text: abruptly, like the turning
text: off of a light.
dialog: Replacing it --
text: A “STILL” PHOTOGRAPH OF THE GROUP
dialog: (Taken by some last, lurking
dialog: spy among the journalists.)
dialog: But if the movie camera has
text: stopped, the SOUND-TRACK is
dialog: still recording, and we hear --
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH’S VOICE
dialog: Expensive vice, isn’t it? When he’s
dialog: had his actor’s girl, he throws her
dialog: away. And then, of course, he’s
dialog: 203
speaker_heading: JULIE RICH’S VOICE (contd.)
dialog: Thrown away his actor, and
dialog: destroyed him in the process...
dialog: Perhaps that’s what he really
dialog: wants --
dialog: A_hard slap!
text: The unmistakable sound
text: of JAKE’s sudden, brutal
dialog: attack...
text: A FLASH from a hand-held
text: camera, roughly turned on
dialog: again, and showing us
dialog: nothing clear... only
text: wild confusion and a
dialog: strong impression of
dialog: violence --
speaker_heading: AL'S VOICE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: They're getting all of this, you
dialog: know -- on film...
speaker_heading: BILLY'S VOICE
dialog: Who gives a shit? What’s their
dialog: public, for Chrissake? -- Before
dialog: one of those creeps can put this
dialog: stuff together we’ll have our
dialog: movie out. A real movie...
dialog: (he breaks off --)
dialog: Silence... (or some-
dialog: thing close to it)...
dialog: From the FILM still run-
text: ing on the big screen --
text: there comes a faint sighing
dialog: of wind...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 204
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE RANCH
dialog: Dawn -- very early, very
dialog: grey...
text: The last of the cars are
text: pulling out of the drive-
text: way and heading for home.
dialog: The house itself would
text: seem to be deserted.
dialog: CALB (the general handy-
dialog: man) is searching the
text: empty, littered rooms,
dialog: calling out an occasional
dialog: “Mr. Hannaford -- “ as he
dialog: goes...
text: Silence answers him...
speaker_heading: THE RANCH
dialog: 
dialog: Dawn -- very early and
dialog: very grey...
text: The last of the cars pulls
text: out of the driveway heading
dialog: for home...
dialog: The house itself would seem
dialog: to be deserted. CALB (the
dialog: general handyway) is
text: searching the littered rooms,
dialog: calling an occasional
dialog: “Mister Hannaford” -- as he
dialog: goes...
dialog: Silence at first...
text: Then a murmuring can be
dialog: heard somewhere in the
dialog: house.
dialog: 205
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE
dialog: --- Old friends are old, and
dialog: that’s the trouble with ‘em...
dialog: 
dialog: (This is, in fact,
dialog: the continuation of
dialog: some talk between JAKE
speaker_heading: and VOGEL, the start
dialog: which we heard early
dialog: last night, and which
dialog: had been recorded. )
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE (contd. )
dialog: They don’t grow old -- it’s just
text: something they stumble over and
dialog: fall into. And they all seem so...
dialog: surprised.
dialog: Poor sods -- they look at you as
dialog: though there was something you
dialog: could do about it...
text: CALB goes searching...
text: through the house and out
text: onto the terrace by the
text: pool... But JAKE’S VOICE
text: grows fainter...
dialog: (But there is someone else
dialog: here) ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE DRIVE-IN THEATRE
text: Almost empty now...
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Hey, Billy --
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hey, Brooksie --
dialog: 206
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: What happened to the critic
dialog: lady?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: She'll live --
speaker_heading: AL
dialog: She'll live to write about it.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Fuck her.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Almost everybody’s gone, looks
dialog: like... Zarah, too?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: She left.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: (with just a whiff
dialog: of JAKE in his
dialog: tone)
dialog: So she did, uncle, so she did...
dialog: Maybe she don’t love us like she used
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Maybe...
dialog: Don’t let him get you down,
dialog: Brooksie.
dialog: 207
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: Not yet. Not quite.
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: We’re hanging tough, Billy.
dialog: -.. Let’s see if we can get a
dialog: laugh out of him --
text: He turns and looks
text: toward the place where
text: JAKE is sitting along
text: in the sports car...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE FILM
dialog: 
dialog: It plays for a time...
dialog: Then we hear:
speaker_heading: JOHN DALE’S VOICE
text: Morning, Hannaford.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: THE THEATRE GATE
dialog: 
text: JAKE'S car lurches to a stop...
text: JOHN DALE'S figure -- unmistak-
text: able in its raincoat and with
text: the curly ash-blonde hair, is
text: in the foreground...
text: JAKE peers at him through the
text: murky light...
dialog: 208
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Johnny -- ?
dialog: No answer.
dialog: Came to my party after all --
speaker_heading: JOHN DALE’S VOICE
dialog: I came to get my car, Hannaford.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (after a silence)
dialog: Get in. I’11 drive you...
speaker_heading: JOHN DALE’S VOICE
dialog: No, thanks.
dialog: Another silence...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Chicken -- ?
dialog: There is no reply...
text: After a long moment,
text: JAKE turns away, puts
text: his foot on the pedal
text: and, with a frantic
text: screeching of tires,
text: the car swerves out
text: through the gates and
text: off down the highway...
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE:
dialog: It was the voice of John
dialog: Dale, but it was not
scene_heading: John Dale. OTTERLAKE
text: takes off the wig.
dialog: (Much earlier we've seen him
text: idly picking it from the
text: head of one of the dummies)...
dialog: 209
speaker_heading: OTTERLAKE
dialog: I’m better than I think...
dialog: And much less funny --
text: He tosses the wig to
text: MAVIS, who utters a
text: tiny whine of disgust
dialog: upon receiving it.
text: Ripping off the rain-
dialog: coat which had completed
text: his disguise, he climbs
text: into his car.
dialog: Come on, sweetie...
dialog: The old man didn’t get to make
dialog: it with you, did he, so who
dialog: does that mean you’re going
dialog: home with? According to the
text: critic lady, with a virgin.
text: He starts the car...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The real JOHN DALE...
speaker_heading: THE RANCH
text: Moving through the empty house...
text: The voice of the handyman
dialog: be heard calling again:
dialog: “Mr. Hannaford...”
text: Silence at first.
text: Then the murmuring from another
dialog: room...
dialog: 210
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE
dialog: .-.. Remember those Berbers -- up
dialog: in the Atlas? They wouldn't
dialog: let us point a camera at ‘em.
dialog: They’re certain that it...
dialog: dries up something...
text: Following the sound,
dialog: JOHN DALE moves into --
speaker_heading: THE BIG ROOM
text: Here, sprawled in a huge
text: leather chair, HIGGAM is
text: sleeping, his tape recorder
text: on his lap...
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: The old eye, you know, behind the
dialog: magic box. Could be it’s an
dialog: evil eye, at that...
dialog: Medusa’s...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE DRIVE-IN THEATRE
text: A deserted field, except
dialog: for THE ACTRESS sitting
text: alone in her little car...
text: The wailing wind and the
text: gypsy song on the theatre’s
text: sound track are joined now
text: by the wailing of police
dialog: sirens -- heard very
dialog: distantly...
text: The sky is clear enough to
text: show the hint of a black
text: pillar of smoke somewhere
dialog: far off...
dialog: 211
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE
dialog: Who knows, maybe you can stare
dialog: too hard at something. Huh? --
dialog: Drain out the virtue -- suck out
dialog: the living juice...
scene_heading: ON THE SCREEN -—
text: The moving images fade
text: under the dead pallor
dialog: of the rising day...
text: THE ACTRESS starts up
text: her car and drives
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE (contd. )
dialog: You shoot the great places and
dialog: the pretty people -- All those girls
dialog: and boys...
dialog: Shoot ‘em dead...
text: The air is lightening;
dialog: morning is almost here;
text: the sun is just under the
speaker_heading: horizon, and JAKE’S FILM
text: is very faint now on the
dialog: big screen...
dialog: THE GIRL seems like a
text: ghost as she returns to
text: the shapeless wreck which
dialog: is all that’s left of the
dialog: OLD MAN'S dwelling place.
dialog: For a moment longer --
text: dim as the image itself --
text: there rises from somewhere
dialog: beneath this ruin the
dialog: gypsy lament... But already
dialog: the wind ius blowing it away...
dialog: Blowing everything away...
dialog: 212
text: Layer after layer flies off
dialog: into the sky... And ten, as
text: the great dust cloud settles,
dialog: there is nothing -- only a
dialog: vast lunar emptiness...
dialog: And silence...
speaker_heading: JAKE'S VOICE (contd. )
dialog: (on the sound track
dialog: of the projected
dialog: film)
dialog: Cut.
