speaker_heading: FADE IN:
speaker_heading: JACK BAKER
text: is standing before a dirty window, looking
text: out at a dirty city street. He is wearing a tuxedo.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: WIDEN ANGLE
text: It's the GIRL from this afternoon.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey.
text: Jack looks at the Girl, sleepy and warm under the
text: bedcovers, then at the rest of the apartment.
dialog: Not good.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Whatcha doin' over there?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Gotta go.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Job.
text: The Girl glances at the bedside clock.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Funny hours.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Funny job.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Will I see you again?
text: Jack looks out at the dirty street again.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
text: The Girl doesn't appear terribly unnerved by this.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (at the tux)
dialog: You weren't wearing that, were
dialog: you? Earlier.
text: Jack shakes his head, taps a brown paper bag on
text: the sill.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Brought it.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Shit, thank God. You look like a creep.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone
dialog: who wore that shit.
text: Jack smiles, grabs the paper bag, and moves to
text: the door.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey.
dialog: (as he stops)
dialog: You got great hands.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - JACK
dialog: Jack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing
text: a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with
text: the milieu. Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an
text: all-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before
text: he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he
text: goes. Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel.
text: Slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at
text: the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Hey, Jackie!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How goes it, Tommy?
speaker_heading: TOMMY (DOORMAN)
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Losing his teeth.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox.
dialog: I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust
text: the taps.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (standing back)
dialog: Jesus, you look like fucking
dialog: royalty, Tommy.
text: Tommy brushes at his new velvet coat.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Yeah. The big boys sent it down
dialog: yesterday.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Another five years, huh?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Like clockwork. You got a good
dialog: memory, Jackie.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It ain't always a blessing. My
dialog: brother here?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (nodding)
text: He's got blood in his eye.
text: Jack glances at his watch, waves to Tommy, and
text: moves into the hotel.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL - ANGLE ON FRANK
text: Jack's older brother, FRANK, is pacing outside the
text: lounge when he sees Jack approaching.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Great. Terrific. Glad you could
dialog: make it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How we doing?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How we ... ? What, are you kidding
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Am I late?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's not the point.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (taking out a cigarette)
dialog: What's the point?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You cannot continue to walk in at
text: the last moment, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You want me to show up late a few
dialog: nights?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Frank. I'm here. I always get
dialog: here. Don't sweat it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Christ, will you look at your hair?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Jack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny
text: tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's wrong with it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You look like you just crawled out
dialog: of bed.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No one's gonna be looking at my
dialog: hair. Come on, we're on.
text: Frank just stands there, bottled up with
text: exasperation.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Careful, Frank. When you get angry your
text: tie starts to spin.
text: Jack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his
text: head, follows. As they move away, a cardboard
text: stand-up is revealed. On it are two 8 X 10 glossies
text: of Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters,
dialog: this: "Tonight! The Doubly Delightful Tones of the
dialog: Fabulous Baker Boys!"
scene_heading: BAKER BROTHERS
text: as they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge
text: and settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent
text: that what the "Fabulous Baker Boys" are, in fact, is a
text: poor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.
scene_heading: WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE
text: As they begin to plink out their "theme song" tables
text: of middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana
text: daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads.
text: After a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and
text: the couples applaud.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Mr. Smile)
dialog: Thank you. Thank you. Good evening and welcome
dialog: to the Starfire lounge. My name is Frank Baker
text: and eighty-eight keys across from me is my
dialog: little brother, Jack.
text: Applause. Little brother Jack smiles, winks, and takes
text: a draw on his cigarette.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing; could do this in his sleep)
dialog: You know, my brother and I have been playing
dialog: together, gosh, I don't know. How long has it
dialog: been, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Twenty-eight years, Frank.
dialog: Applause.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's a lot of water under the
dialog: bridge, eh, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Lotta water.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Of course, back then, things were a little
dialog: different. I was eight, Jack was seven, just
dialog: about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie
dialog: Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would
dialog: listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: We must have shaved three lives off that cat,
dialog: eh, Jack?
text: Laughter. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of
text: razor blades.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: But seriously. It's been fifteen years since
text: Jack and I first stepped on the stage as
dialog: professionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities,
text: and more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later...
dialog: well, believe me, we've seen our share of this
dialog: crazy country of ours. But even though we've
dialog: played some of the finest venues in the world ...
text: At this point, Jack begins to mimic his brother's words.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... There's one place that's always been, for us,
dialog: a very special place, and that place is... this
text: place, the Starfire lounge.
text: Jack lays in a few soft bass chords.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Why? Well, I guess you could just say it's
dialog: the ...
dialog: (pregnant moment)
dialog: ... people.
text: At which point Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard
dialog: and give birth to the melody of -- what else? "People.'
scene_heading: JACK AND FRANK - LATER
text: They exit the stage to applause.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thank you. Remember, room service is available
dialog: till one A.M. for you late-nighters.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL KITCHEN
text: Jack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't make trouble, all right?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who's gonna make trouble?
dialog: (spotting someone)
dialog: Hey, amigo!
speaker_heading: JACK'S POV - MAN
text: in an apron, cutting meat off a huge soup bone,
text: looks up.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Jack!
dialog: (lower)
dialog: Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (the feeling's mutual)
dialog: Yeah, hi, Hector.
speaker_heading: HECTOR (MAN)
dialog: (re: the soup bone)
dialog: For Eddie. I wrap.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Gracias.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (as they exit)
dialog: I mean it, Jack. Behave.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Like an angel.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE
text: Frank stands across the desk from a YOUNG MAN who,
text: despite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal
text: attitude toward the two men in his office. Jack stays
text: in the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture
dialog: any further is to risk contracting some hideous
dialog: disease.
speaker_heading: LLOYD (YOUNG MAN)
dialog: (preparing a cash envelope)
dialog: Terrific, boys. Really. Terrific.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thanks, Lloyd.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yes, sir. You're just what we needed on a night
dialog: like this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh ... thanks.
text: Frank glances at Jack and realizes he should have left
text: him in the kitchen with Hector and the soup bone.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Only, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal? If you
dialog: wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go
text: play with the niggers on State Street. These
dialog: blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some
text: guy dripping ash all over himself while he's
dialog: playing 'The Sound of Music.'
speaker_heading: ANGLE - JACK
text: Smoke curls out of Jack's nose. He is utterly still,
text: like a pit bull eyeing a steak.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more
dialog: lessons. By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this.
text: Lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and,
text: business closed, busies himself with other matters.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us
dialog: back, do you, Lloyd?
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I'll call you.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I
dialog: thought maybe...
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: I'll call you.
text: Frank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Count it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Count it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jack...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Count the fucking money, Frank.
text: Lloyd looks up. Jack is staring right into him.
text: Reluctantly, Frank opens the envelope.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's all here.
dialog: (pulling Jack out)
dialog: I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.
text: Lloyd doesn't answer. He just looks at Jack, smiling
text: with amusement.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - JACK AND FRANK
text: Jack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped
text: soup bone, dogged by Frank, who's got the cardboard
text: stand-up under his arm.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You mind telling me what that was about in there?
dialog: Was that planned?
dialog: Or were you just bored and decided
dialog: to get creative?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fuck him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on
dialog: Route 81, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fuck him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to himself)
text: Fuck him. Great. Terrific. Fuck him.
text: The fabulous Bakers walk in silence until they come to
text: Frank's car. Frank opens the trunk and starts to put
text: the stand-up away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So we on tomorrow night?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (shaking his head)
text: Maybe Thursday. I hear the harpist at the
dialog: Sheraton's got appendicitis.
text: Jack nods and starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey.
text: Jack stops.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Listen ... why don't you come out to the house
dialog: this weekend. Say hello to the kids.
dialog: They've grown.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I hate your kids, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're their uncle.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Only by relation. Besides, they hate me, too.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They don't. They're always asking about you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It was an accident.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little
dialog: one ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cindy.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub.
dialog: How do you explain that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: She didn't know what she was doing.
dialog: You're too sensitive.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You got weird kids, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Look, I just thought if you came out you might
dialog: see what you're missing.
text: Jack just stares at Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Just think about it, all right?
dialog: Consider it a standing offer.
text: Frank closes the trunk and moves to the driver's side.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing;like a litany)
dialog: You want a ride, Jack? No, Frank,
dialog: I'll walk. Okay, Jack, good night.
dialog: Good night, Frank.
text: Frank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb.
text: Jack watches the taillights burn into the distance,
text: then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads
dialog: for home.
scene_heading: ANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING
text: Jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment
text: building, where a black labrador is studying him from
text: a second story window.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT
text: Jack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably
text: cluttered. The most striking item is a vintage phone
text: booth placed against the wall. As Jack lets himself in,
text: EDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over. He is not
text: an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his
text: face that he has a great deal of affection for Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hi, pal. Thought you were gonna clean the
dialog: apartment.
text: Eddie nuzzles the soup bone. Jack unwraps the paper
text: and hands it over.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Take it easy, will ya? You're becoming a regular
dialog: Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth
dialog: around here.
text: Jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over
text: to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs.
text: He lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the
text: MACHINE. As Bill Evans' smoky "PEACE PIECE" fills the
text: tiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and
text: walks over to the old piano near the window. Settling
text: back with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows
text: gently on the keys and stares out the open window,
text: listening to the music.
scene_heading: INT. PIANO STORE
text: Jack and Frank work opposite sides of a large piano
text: showroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color.
text: WILLIE, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap
text: upright, contemplating his shoes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Out.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: When they coming in?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: Wednesday next.
text: Frank looks across the room at Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What d'ya got?,
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Bosen black.
dialog: (taps a key)
dialog: Flat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What d'you say, Willie? Tighten her up?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: What's the gig?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Two nights.
text: Willie just looks at his shoes and shakes his head.
text: Frank frowns and glances around.
text: Across the room, Jack pauses before another piano.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What d'ya got?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (tapping)
dialog: Yamaha white. Nice.
text: Frank moves to another grand and alternates taps with
text: his brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Try the black Knable.
text: Frank moves to another piano and repeats the process,
text: watching Jack for a verdict.
text: After a moment, Jack nods.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tag 'em, Willie. The Regency downtown,
dialog: Thursday-Friday. Thanks.
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: My pleasure.
scene_heading: INT. DINER
text: The brothers sit at a window of a corner diner,
text: Jack nursing an ice coffee,
text: Frank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs.
text: The glass next to them is cluttered with photographs
dialog: of neighborhood luminaries,
text: including two of Jack and Frank in their tuxedoes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know, I think it's been five years since I
dialog: saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Trust me, you're not missing anything.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You look awful.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Really. You sleeping?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Only on odd days.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (a look)
dialog: Seeing anyone in particular?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why the interest?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Because I'm your brother. Because I care about
dialog: you. Because sometimes it seems like the most
dialog: significant relationship in your life is with
dialog: that goddamn dog of yours.
text: Jack studies his brother's face.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not seeing anyone. In particular.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Uh-uh. How about you? You seeing anyone?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Funny.
dialog: (points at his wedding band)
dialog: Strike a bell?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: It's only a ring. Not a collar.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's more than that.
text: Jack smiles and sips his coffee.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, I mean it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So do I.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We gotta go, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up
dialog: there every couple weeks you feel guilty.
dialog: I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This time you gotta go.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't gotta go.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You gotta go.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Says who?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Your older brother.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're thirteen months older than me, Frank.
dialog: That might've meant something in the Apache
text: clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
text: Jack glances up. Frank nods.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: So what do you say?
dialog: Think the city can spare you for an afternoon?
text: Jack squints out the window.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Okay. And don't worry about a present.
dialog: I got her something from both of us.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Jack, cradling a pink bakery box in one hand,
text: gets out of Frank's car and surveys the street
dialog: on which he grew up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Make sure you lock.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
dialog: Unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses
text: three houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth
text: of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity.
text: But it's not Jack's car, so he doesn't press the point.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Place looks good, huh? I got a neighbor boy to
dialog: mow the lawn, pick up. Five bucks.
dialog: Times've changed, huh?
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: See the tree?
dialog: Remember the job Cecil did on it the day
dialog: Dad planted it?
text: You can still see the scars on the trunk. Really.
dialog: I was looking at it just the other day.
dialog: Jesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat.
text: Frank smiles, recalling Cecil's near-demise,
text: then raps on the front door.
text: Jack studies the tree a moment,
text: then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in Frank's hand.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So what'd we get her?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You'll see.
scene_heading: ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
text: At that moment, the door swings open and ELLIE BAKER
text: is there, a vibrant woman in her sixties.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How's the birthday girl?
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
text: A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
text: Mrs. Baker hugs Frank, then, a bit awkwardly,
text: embraces Jack.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: John. It's good to see you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (uncomfortable; balancing cake box)
dialog: Good to see you, Ma.
text: Jack looks over his mother's shoulder at Frank and
text: mimics "John" with a knowing nod.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore.
text: Jack. He goes by Jack.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: I thought maybe held gotten over that.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Twenty years, Ma ...
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Yes, yes. It's just that John is so much nicer.
dialog: Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl,
dialog: we had a pig on the farm named Jack.
dialog: I guess I just can't help making the association.
text: Jack's eyes slide over to Frank as if to suggest he
text: holds his brother personally responsible for this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma,
dialog: John Kennedy went by Jack.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Catholics. What do you expect?
dialog: Oh, well, what's in a name, right?
dialog: Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
text: As Mrs. Baker exits, Frank leans over to Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Keep her busy, will ya?
dialog: I have to set a few things up.
text: Frank disappears, leaving Jack alone on the porch
text: with the bakery box. Jack shakes his head,
text: wondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon,
text: then enters the house.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE
text: The front room is cluttered with his childhood.
text: Most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights,
text: perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed
text: with age. Above them, pressed between glass and framed,
text: are the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight.
text: Finally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog-eared,
text: piled everywhere in drunken stacks.
text: This and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly,
text: warily, but with a noticeable dispassion,
text: until his eyes fall upon a photograph.
text: In it, he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man
text: in baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms.
text: Frank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean,
text: perfectly posed, but Jack, a year younger,
text: his shirt too big, is caught in profile,
text: looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (entering)
dialog: Well, now, where's everyone run off to?
dialog: Frank?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Downstairs.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Oh.
text: All at once, Jack and his mother realize they are alone.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Well, shall we cut that cake?
text: Jack nods and follows her into the kitchen.
text: He places the box on the table and stands off to the
text: side while Mrs. Baker sets about preparing things.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: So. How are you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fine. You?
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Oh, fine.
dialog: Silence.
text: Jack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake.
text: Her fingers are trembling.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Big piece or little?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Huh? Oh, no.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: None?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not much for sweets.
text: Mrs. Baker nods.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: How's that dog of yours? What was his name?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Eddie.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Yes. Right. Eddie. How is he?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: He's losing his teeth.
text: Mrs. Baker stops and looks up into Jack's eyes.
text: Suddenly, a NOISE is heard in the other room.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Sounds like your brothers back with us.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Frank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an
text: old movie projector and a roll-up screen.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (entering)
dialog: What's all this?
text: Frank sets the projector down and hands his mother the
text: tiny ribboned box.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Go on.
text: Jack watches from the kitchen doorway as Mrs. Baker
text: pulls the ribbon off the box.
text: Inside is a tiny spool of film.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Why, what's this?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN (LATER)
text: Blank screen, curtains drawn, the room dark.
text: Frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake.
text: Mrs. Baker close on his elbow,
text: sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen.
text: Jack sits off to the side.
text: A title card appears:
dialog: "For Mrs. Ellie Baker, who made it all possible."
text: Mrs. Baker gives Frank a puzzled look.
text: He just smiles.
text: Suddenly, images spring to the screen,
text: obviously footage several years old,
text: showing Jack and Frank as children,
text: sitting at the tiny pianos, wearing matching suits,
text: smiling matching smiles as they play for the camera.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Oh my God ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Recognize these two characters?
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: I thought these were lost.
dialog: Where did you find ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: In the attic. Behind some of Dad's stuff.
text: (pointing with his fork)
text: Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
text: As Frank's laughter fills the dark room,
text: Jack stares with cold fascination at the screen.
text: Suddenly, a jagged cut springs the boys a year later,
text: in the same positions, smiling the same smiles.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Oh no!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them
dialog: all together. Boy, old man Henderson didn't
dialog: fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
text: Jack says nothing.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Oh, look at you two. So skinny.
dialog: And those tiny suits ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wait. Watch. Here comes Dad.
text: Jack's eyes narrow as the film jumps another year
text: and a man enters the frame, obviously by accident.
text: He is so tall his face cannot be seen.
text: As he dances quickly out of sight,
text: he ruffles Jack's hair.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: That man.
text: As the film jumps again,
text: Jack glances at the photograph to his right.
text: The images on the screen flicker softly off
text: the glass of the picture frame.
speaker_heading: MRS. BAKER (O.S.)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh, look how you're growing.
dialog: My little boys ...
text: Jack's eyes drift from the photograph to his mother
text: and brother, sitting close together in the love seat,
text: laughing. After a moment, their voices fade and Jack
text: looks back to the children on the screen,
text: like two tiny men, mirror images of one another.
text: At first the changes are subtle.
text: Little Jack's tie is askew, his shirt missing a button.
text: But as the years flick by, the brothers resemble one
dialog: another less and less, until finally,
text: the little boy that was Jack is completely gone and in
text: his place is a slouching, tousle-haired adolescent in
text: rumpled coat and open collar,
text: a cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip.
text: A woman's hand darts into the frame and plucks the
text: offending cigarette away in a flash.
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: Frank and Jack are parked in front of Jack's building.
text: Whispers of steam snake from the
text: mancovers in the street.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I made her nervous.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Her hands. Like that.
text: Jack holds out a trembling hand.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nah. Medication.
text: Jack looks over at Frank. He nods.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Couple years, now.
dialog: (taps his heart)
text: Keeps the beat steady. Nothing serious.
text: Jack considers this a moment, then gets out of the car.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She was glad to see you.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT
text: Jack lets himself into his apartment and stops.
text: Across the room, curled up on the couch, is a little girl.
text: Jack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to
text: the bedroom. As he folds a blanket under her chin,
text: he pauses. The girl's face is calm, peaceful.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAWN
text: The next morning. Early.
text: The sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and
text: beginning to drip out onto the street. Suddenly,
text: RINGING OUT over the rooftops, is "JINGLE BELLS"
dialog: -- not the entire song, just the first two bars,
text: over and over.
scene_heading: IHT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Jack, on the couch, his arm draped over a slumbering
text: Eddie, opens his eyes. Across the room,
text: seated at the piano, is NINA, the little girl.
text: She stops playing and turns.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Morning. You want coffee? I made coffee.
text: Jack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up.
text: He nods to the coffee. Nina goes to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I did the dishes last night. You're missing a cup.
text: Jack rubs his head, then gets up and walks to the window.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Did you break a cup, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Eddie did.
text: Nina looks at Eddie, sleeping on the couch,
text: then brings Jack his coffee with both hands.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I practiced the piano last night. Two hours.
dialog: I think I'm ready for 'Jingle all the way.'
text: Jack nods. Suddenly, the sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS is heard.
text: Jack and Nina glance up at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Guess they're up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sounds big. What's he do?
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Process server.
dialog: Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours
dialog: are more regular. All I know's he came to take
dialog: the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for
dialog: dinner. And breakfast.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What happened to the donut king?
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Married.
text: Upstairs, a DOOR SLAMS and HEAVY FEET ECHO in the
text: stairwell. Nina peers out the window.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: No breakfast. Maybe they had a fight.
text: TWO DEEP THUMPS sound on the ceiling.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Well, gotta go. Teach me later?
text: Jack nods.
text: Nina kisses him on the cheek and exits.
text: Jack walks over to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey.
scene_heading: INT. LUAU LOUNGE
text: Though the plastic palms and grass-skirted waitresses
text: of the Luau Lounge make the Fabulous Baker Boys' presence
text: seem a bit incongruous, Jack and Frank hold nothing back,
text: giving "McCarthur Park" the full treatment.
text: Unfortunately, the audience in the Luau Lounge wouldn't
text: fill a Hawaiian haystack and their applause
dialog: is less than volcanic.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh, thank you. That concludes our show for this
dialog: evening. Jack and I only hope you enjoyed
dialog: yourselves as much as we did.
text: As the guests wander out, clutching their roomkeys,
text: a freckle-faced BELLHOP comes up.
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: Mr. Baker.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (tired)
dialog: Yeah, Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (BELLHOP)
dialog: Mr. Simpson asked to see you.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: All right, tell him I'll be right there.
text: As Jimmy exits, Frank stands and points at Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Tomorrow we close with the 'Aquarius Suite.'
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
text: Frank pauses before a door marked "HOTEL MANAGER."
text: It's half-open. Inside, CHARLIE SIMPSON,
text: a heavy man in a shiny suit,
text: is throwing darts in the general direction of a
text: dartboard. He's not very good. Frank knocks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Frankie.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You wanted to see me, Charlie?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, come on in.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Little slow tonight.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (waving it off)
dialog: Mondays.
text: Charlie takes an envelope from his desk and hands it
dialog: to Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Your pay.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Now? Why not tomorrow? After the show.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Take it now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What about tomorrow?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We don't need you, Frankie.
text: For a moment, Frank just stands there.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I've got the grands for two nights,
dialog: Charlie. You can't just --
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: It's all there. Both nights.
text: Frank looks at the envelope in his hands.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What're you saying, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Look, Frankie. You and Jack been
dialog: playing here, a long time.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Twelve years.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right, twelve years. Couple times
dialog: a month.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So maybe it's time we took a vacation from
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Vacation? Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night.
dialog: You said so yourself.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie.
text: I got six waiters standing in back listening
dialog: to baseball. I gotta move the liquor.
dialog: To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables.
dialog: It's a matter of economics. Me, I love you.
dialog: I love both you guys, you know that.
dialog: You're class. But people today.
dialog: They don't know class if it walks up and
dialog: grabs 'em by the balls.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY
text: Jack rises as Frank passes through the lobby with
text: the cardboard stand-up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's with Charlie?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nothing. Everything's great.
dialog: Terrific.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE
text: With the stand-up under his arm,
text: Frank enters and closes the door quietly.
text: A light is glowing in the kitchen.
text: The rest of the house is dark, quiet. In the kitchen,
text: he checks the message pad by the phone. Nothing.
text: On the table, a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him.
text: Next to it is a stack of bills with a note attached:
dialog: "Frank. Please."
text: Frank sighs and leans the stand-up against the wall.
text: The photo of Jack is peeling off the cardboard.
text: Finding a stack of glossies in a drawer,
text: Frank removes the old Jack from the stand-up and
text: replaces it with a new one.
text: As he presses the photograph in place,
text: his eyes drift to the one of himself.
dialog: It was taken a long time ago.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT
text: Jack places a record on the turntable and sits at the
text: piano by the window. As the needle hits the spinning
text: disc, a sharp, snappy BASS LINE REVERBERATES throughout
text: the apartment. Jack takes a drink, then joins in with
text: the record, playing along. His concentration is intense,
text: so much so that, a moment later, when the PHONE RINGS,
text: he seems not to hear it. Finally, he picks it up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.)
dialog: It's me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.)
dialog: Yeah. Listen ... come out to the
dialog: house tomorrow, will ya?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've had enough family for one
dialog: month, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.)
dialog: It's not family. It's business.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So talk to me tomorrow. After
dialog: the gig.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.)
dialog: We don't get a gig.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0.)
dialog: Something came up. Don't worry,
text: Charlie stayed true. Both nights.
dialog: I'll give you your share tomorrow.
text: At the house.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.0)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: So you'll come out, right?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, okay.
text: Jack listens to the PHONE HISSING in the dark,
text: then the CONNECTION goes DEAD.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: A taxi lets Jack off on a street of shabby tract houses.
text: In his rumpled city suit, Jack looks like a cheap
text: gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers.
text: He walks up to the door of a small white house and
text: presses the doorbell.
text: When there is no response, he goes around to the back.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD
text: The backyard is small, with a short chainlink fence
text: surrounding it. Two kids, a girl and a boy,
text: are splashing around in a build-it-yourself
text: above-ground pool.
text: When they see Jack, they stop splashing.
text: Only their heads are visible above the water.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, kids. Dad home?
text: The two heads say nothing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What d'ya say? Wanna run and get
dialog: him for me?
text: Still nothing. Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette,
text: and pats his pocket for a match.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Shit.
text: The kids' eyes widen at his profanity.
text: Jack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip,
text: ponders things for a moment,
text: then flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence.
dialog: At which point,
text: the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, kid. Take it easy.
dialog: No use. The kid's a world-class screamer.
text: Frank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed,
text: comes racing out of the house.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cindy! What is it?
text: Cindy points. At Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your doorbell doesn't work.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Honey, it's only Uncle Jack. You
dialog: remember Uncle Jack.
text: DONNA, Frank's wife, appears.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: What's the matter? Jack?
text: Jack waves.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (lifting Cindy out of the pool)
dialog: Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: I'll take her inside. You too,
text: little Frank. Out of the pool.
text: Donna shepherds the kids toward the house.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Feet!
text: The kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat
text: and disappear into the house. Frank turns to Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's probably the excitement of
dialog: seeing you again.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD (LATER)
text: Donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade.
text: The men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed
text: aluminum chairs.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, look at this.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: You bring trunks, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Trunks?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Swimming trunks.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Too bad. You could use some sun.
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe next time.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: We have some lotion.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just the same.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Suit yourself.
text: Donna returns to the house.
text: Frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his
text: surroundings complacently.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nice, huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The trees. The flowers. Nice.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Terrific.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (expansively)
dialog: Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring.
dialog: After the rains. Look good as new.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You ask me out here to sell me
dialog: your house, Frank?
text: Frank shakes the ice in his glass.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Charlie paid you off last night,
dialog: didn't he?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know what you mean.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The hell you don't.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I told you. Something came up.
dialog: Some political dinner or something.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Bullshit. Fifteen years, Frank.
dialog: No one paid us off.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It wasn't like that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What was it like?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right?
dialog: I got two kids. I got a wife.
dialog: Besides, he made the deal.
dialog: There's no shame in it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That how you see it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, that's how I see it.
text: Jack shakes his head in disgust.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And don't go shaking your head, little brother.
dialog: I'm not the one who walks in every night smelling
text: like he's got a day job in a piss factory.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It killed him, you know.
text: Jack glances up. Dangerous territory.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: A gust of wind killed him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, and what put him up there?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, you weren't there. Right?
text: Jack's look ends this. Frank sighs.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Look, can we forget last night?
dialog: We gotta talk.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Talk.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I been thinking maybe we should
dialog: make some changes.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I been thinking maybe we should
text: take on a singer.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure, why not.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's just an idea. I want your opinion.
dialog: I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's more like 40-60, wouldn't
dialog: you say?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We agreed that if I took care of the business;
dialog: I'd be entitled to the extra.
dialog: Isn't that what we agreed?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's what we agreed.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If you're unhappy with the
dialog: arrangement --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not unhappy.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If you'd like to assume more of the financial
dialog: responsibilities, I'd be glad --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Frank. Fuck it. Okay?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I've tried to do well by you, Jack.
dialog: By both of us.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm grateful, Frank. How much?
dialog: For the singer.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I thought maybe twenty percent.
dialog: Look, with the additional bookings we'll
text: come out ahead. The big hotels,
dialog: they want a pretty girl with a big voice.
dialog: We have to stay competitive, Jack.
text: Jack laughs coldly.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You, Frank. All these years you been telling me
dialog: we're different. We got novelty, Jack.
dialog: No one can touch us.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Two pianos isn't enough anymore,
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It never was.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
text: in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the
text: center of a tiny room in the back of Willie's piano
text: showroom, holding some sheet music. Sammy Davis Jr.'s
text: face is on the sheet music. Frank is sitting against
text: the opposite wall, a notepad in his hand.
text: Jack is at the piano.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good morning, Miss...?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Moran. Monica Moran.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: All right, Miss Moran
speaker_heading: MONICA (YOUNG WOMAN)
dialog: Actually, that's my stage name.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Moran. Monica. The whole thing.
dialog: It's my stage name. My real name's Blanche.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Blanche.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: No romance, right? That's why I came up with
dialog: Monica. It's what I prefer.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, that's fine --
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: But if you call my house and my mother answers,
dialog: ask for Blanche. If you ask for Monica, she'll
dialog: think you have the wrong number and hang up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her.
dialog: She's opposed to my career.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh-huh. Well, Miss Moran, what
dialog: is it you'd like to do for us?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Candy Man.'
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Is that all right?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's one of Jack's favorites.
text: Monica turns and, seeing Jack at the piano,
text: gives a little start.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Oops. I almost forgot you were
dialog: there. Here's the music.
text: Monica begins to hand Jack the sheet music.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh... he knows it.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Really? Isn't that a coincidence.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Small world.
text: Monica smiles. She likes Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, shall we?
text: Probably not, but Jack begins to play anyway,
text: laconically picking out the cheery tune while Monica
text: swings her arms and taps her foot. Despite all this,
text: Monica still manages to come in between beats and Jack
text: has to scramble over a chord to catch her,
text: sort of like a fireman with a net.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Who can take a sunrise
dialog: Sprinkle it with dew
dialog: Toss it in the air and
dialog: Make a groovy lemon pie
dialog: The Candy Man can
dialog: The Candy Man can...,
dialog: There would appear to be ample evidence as to why the
text: mother of Monica nee Blanche opposes her
dialog: daughter's career.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.
text: Monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up.
text: Frank looks over at Jack.
text: Jack shrugs and continues to play.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Miss Moran ... Miss Moran ...
dialog: Blanche!
text: Monica's eyes pop open.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Oh, sorry. I get so caught up in
dialog: it sometimes. It's scary.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes, it is.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Well ... thanks.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Bye.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Drive carefully.
text: As Monica exits, Jack and Frank glance at one another
text: and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring
text: singers who can't sing. As Frank sinks lower in his
text: chair and Jack's ashtray spills over with wounded
text: cigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes,
dialog: and colors, come forth to offer their own unique
dialog: interpretations of "Feelings," "I Gotta Be Me,"
dialog: "This Is My Song," and perhaps most appropriately,
dialog: "What Kind of Fool Am I."
text: Finally, when it is all over,
text: Jack and Frank are left alone in the tiny room,
text: looking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal.
scene_heading: TALL YOUNG WOMAN
text: As the sequence ends, a TALL YOUNG WOMAN in high heels
text: walks into Willie's. She glances around,
text: then spots Willie across the room,
text: eating a corn beef on rye.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hey. You one of the fabulous
dialog: Baker Boys?
speaker_heading: JACK AND FRANK
text: are putting on their coats, preparing to leave.
text: Frank is staring at his notepad.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Thirty-seven girls.
dialog: And not one who can carry a tune.
dialog: That must be statistically impossible.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It was a somewhat extraordinary
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I just don't understand. You
dialog: would think someone ... anyone ...
speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Damn!
text: The Woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway,
text: holding a shoe in her hand. It's broken.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Brand new Thursday. You believe
dialog: it?
text: After today, Jack and Frank are prepared
dialog: to believe anything.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This where the auditions are?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is where the auditions were.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We're finished.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What about me?
text: Frank looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're an hour and a half late.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: My watch is broken, too.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Punctuality. First rule of show
dialog: business.
text: The Woman looks around her.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: This is show business?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (in no mood)
dialog: Look, miss. We're tired,
dialog: you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (touching her lip)
dialog: Just like that, huh? You're not
dialog: even gonna give me a chance?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't take it personally.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: How should I take it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Impersonally.
text: Frank begins to leave.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: I don't believe it. I come all the way down down
dialog: here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me
text: a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a
text: few minutes late.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're an hour and a half late.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We ran long.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: So run a little longer.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Miss --
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You find a girl?
text: Jack and Frank glance at each other.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: So. I'm here, you're here, the
dialog: piano's here. What d'ya say?
text: Before Frank can answer, Jack walks over to the piano.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Terrific. Thirty-eight.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What's that mean? Thirty-eight.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't worry about it.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: You know, I'm feeling a lot of
dialog: hostility from you.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (appealing)
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's get it over with.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: All right. What's your name?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Susie. Susie Diamond.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Catchy. You have any previous entertainment
dialog: experience, Miss Diamond?
speaker_heading: SUSIE (WOMAN)
dialog: Well ... for the last four years
dialog: I've been on call to Triple A
dialog: Escort service.
text: Jack and Frank exchange a glance.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, it's legit. Strictly dinner
dialog: and dance.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay. I think that's all we
dialog: need to know.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I sing now?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's the premise.
text: Susie gives Frank a dark look, then turns to Jack.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I Get Along Without You.' Slowly,
dialog: okay?
text: Jack nods and begins to play.
text: Frank slouches down in his chair,
text: preparing to be tortured again.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing; singing)
dialog: I get along without you very well
dialog: Of course I do
dialog: Except when soft rains fall
dialog: And drip from leaves, then I recall
dialog: The thrill of being
dialog: Sheltered in your arms
dialog: Of course I do
dialog: But I get along without you very well.'
text: Susie stops. Frank just sits there.
text: Jack just sits there. She can sing.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (blinking)
dialog: Uh ... we'll let you know.
text: Jack looks over at Frank like he's insane.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: When we know.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Don't leave a girl hanging.
dialog: Second rule of show business.
text: Frank's not amused.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Yeah, well, okay. 'Bye, Bakers.
text: Susie walks out barefoot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are you, crazy?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I just thought we should talk
dialog: about it. Between ourselves.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's there to talk about? She can sing.
text: That puts her at the head of the class.
text: That makes her the only one in the class.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: I don't know ... She had gum on her lip,
dialog: for Christ sake.
dialog: I don't think she's right for the act.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (studying him)
dialog: You're getting cold feet about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I was just thinking what Ma would
dialog: think.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ma? Ma? Was Ma there the last time we played the
dialog: Ambassador? Oh, that's right, she was on bass.
dialog: How could I forget.
text: Frank frowns and looks down at his hands.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How many other silent partners are there, Frank?
dialog: Donna? Little Cindy?
dialog: Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, okay. I'll call the girl.
text: Frank gets up wearily, then glances down at the notepad.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I didn't get her number.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Jack and Frank dash out of Willie's and glance up
text: and down the street. Nothing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We can always look her up in the
dialog: book.
text: JACK.
dialog: Right. Susie Diamond. She's probably listed right
text: next to Monica Moran.
text: Jack shakes his head in disgust.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Does this mean I get the job?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Jack and Frank whirl around.
text: There, standing in the doorway, is Susie.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Intuition.
scene_heading: CITY SKYLINE
text: Gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day.
text: Once again, "JINGLE BELLS" is heard,
dialog: only this time carried a little further:
text: "Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way..."
text: JACK, FRANK AND SUSIE
text: Ensconsed in the back room of Willie's, preparing
dialog: for their first rehearsal ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ready?
text: Jack nods.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ready?
text: Susie nods. Frank poises his hands over the piano,
text: hesitates, then looks at Jack again.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ready?
text: Jack squints at Frank, then nods.
text: Frank turns to Susie.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: What are we, an orchestra all of
dialog: a sudden?
text: Frank g1ares at her.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Sorry.
text: Frank poises his hands over the piano again and
text: begins to play the opening passage of
text: "Just the Way You Are." A moment later, Jack joins in,
text: and a moment after that, Susie. Unfortunately,
text: Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone,
text: are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a
dialog: fifth grade recital.
text: After a few bars, Susie holds up her hand.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Fellas, fellas ...
text: Jack and Frank stop.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's the problem?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: The problem is I can't hear myself
dialog: sing with all this...
dialog: (searching)
dialog: ... music. You know what I'm saying?
text: Jack and Frank look at one another.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I mean, back there it may be hard to notice,
dialog: but up here I'm having a little trouble
dialog: getting a word in.
text: Jack and Frank just stare.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I mean, you're supposed to be
dialog: backing me up, right?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (icily)
dialog: No. We are not supposed to be
dialog: backing you up.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: What I mean is --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We're a team. We work together.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: So work with me, not against me.
dialog: Okay?
text: Frank stares at Susie for a long moment.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I suppose we can bring it down a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll drop the eighths.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay?
text: Susie looks at the two brothers.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: WILLIE'S SHOWROOM - LATER
text: Frank is on Willie's telephone.
text: In the front of the store, just out of earshot,
text: Jack sits at a beat-up grand,
text: while Susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm telling you, Ray. She's got
text: a voice like an angel ... What?
text: Frank glances furtively across the room to where Susie,
text: making a very sexy silhouette against the front window,
text: is running her hand over a pearl-white piano.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: No, I wouldn't say she's got a
text: body like an angel.
text: As Frank continues to talk in the background,
text: Susie looks over at Jack.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Hey, he's not sore, is he?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He'll come around.
text: Susie nods, goes back to stroking the piano.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You never sang before?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Not for money. With my mother.
text: Jack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: She used to waitress downtown, nights,
dialog: when I was a kid. On the way home, we'd sing.
dialog: You know how people whistle when they're nervous?
dialog: My mother sang. She always said you're never alone
dialog: with a song 'cause thousands of people know the
dialog: same song and even though you can't hear 'em,
dialog: they're singing with you. I don't know.
text: If they were, they were all singing safe inside
dialog: their apartments.
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: But it worked. We always got home. Ever since,
dialog: I always wanted to sing.
dialog: I never took lessons or anything, though.
dialog: I guess you guys took a lot of lessons.
text: Jack looks down at the piano in front of him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. We took a lot of lessons.
scene_heading: JACK AND NINA
text: Jack's tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets
text: ready for the night's gig. Nina, standing next to him
text: at the sink, watches as he works up a lather on a bar
text: of shaving soap, then paints his face with the suds.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: You shave like an old movie, Jack.
text: As Jack picks up a razor, Nina takes the brush and begins
text: to soap her face in the mirror.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that
dialog: he kept at the barber shop. Then, whenever he
dialog: wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop
text: and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Is that what you used to do?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My days are not the old days,
dialog: genius.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: What are they?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The recent past.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (nodding to the ceiling)
text: Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: NINA
text: I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I guess it's getting serious.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: NINA
text: I hope not. He's already busted the springs
dialog: in two chairs. Hey, what's this?
text: Nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ivory.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Looks old.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Older than me.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Wow.
text: Jack gives Nina a look, then begins to splash his face.
text: Nina picks up the razor.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, what do you want to do? Grow
dialog: a beard?
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, let's get your first prom
dialog: under the belt, okay?
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: What's a prom?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ever go to church?
text: Nina nods.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's like that. Only you gotta
dialog: dance.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL
text: As Jack enters the hotel, he passes by the cardboard
text: stand-up, prominently displayed in the lobby.
text: It is virtually unchanged, except for a small notation
text: at the bottom: "With Guest Vocalist."
text: On the other side of the lobby,
text: Frank is pacing nervously.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where the hell is she?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's early.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I told everyone seven-fifteen.
dialog: Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She'll get here.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just like the day of the auditions,
dialog: right? Jesus. How's my hair?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Awe inspiring.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, well, Your's isn't.
dialog: (taking out a comb)
dialog: Let me run a comb though it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get out of here.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on, stand still.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get out of here!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's not gonna hurt you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll hit you, Frank. I swear.
text: Frank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to
text: feint an opponent, then takes a flick at Jack's hair.
text: Jack hits him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (holding his shoulder)
dialog: You hit me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I told you I was gonna hit you.
text: He looks capable of hitting him again, too.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: All right, all right. I'm a little
dialog: tense.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're a fucking alarm clock.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I just wish she'd get here, that's
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She's here.
text: Susie, wearing a flamboyant orange dress,
text: is standing across the lobby, staring at the stand-up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna
dialog: wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense
dialog: to come in the back.
dialog: (walking over)
dialog: Good evening, Miss Diamond. You're late.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Where's my name?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What-?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: And how come you guys are the only ones with
dialog: your pictures on the poster?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We'll talk about it later. Right
dialog: now, you gotta get changed.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Changed?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where's your dress?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: What's he talking about?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is there a language problem here? Your dress.
dialog: For tonight. Where is it?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Do I look like I'm naked?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That! You can't wear that!
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: What's wrong with it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's orange!
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Am I missing something?
text: Before Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie's hand and
text: pulls her toward the door.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on. We don't have much time.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Time for what?
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE
text: Frank, Jack and Susie dash through a cavernous
text: downtown department store, the brothers turning a few
text: heads with their tuxedoes. As they reach the ladies'
text: department, Frank begins to flip through the
text: dress racks.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: If you ask me, this is pretty
dialog: stupid.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just look. What do you wear?
dialog: A nine?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (offended)
dialog: A seven.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: My wife wears a seven. You don't
dialog: look like a seven to me.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I wear a seven.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, okay. Here, how about this?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (looking)
dialog: Save it for your wife.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We're not exactly silly with time,
dialog: you know. Jack, you find anything?
text: Jack, somewhat out of his element, is looking at belts.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Here, how's this?
text: Frank holds out an inky black dress. Susie gives it
text: a long look.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Close enough. Let's go.
text: Frank begins to drag Susie into the dressing room.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Hey, pal. I don't know about you, but where I
text: come from there's a little girl's room and a
text: little boy's room and the little boys don't go
dialog: where the little girls go.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: All right, but make it quick.
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: Shoes! What size do you wear?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (from the dressing room)
dialog: Nine.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nine?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Nine!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to himself)
text: Big feet.
scene_heading: INT. SHOE DEPARTMENT
text: Frank and Jack work the shoe department,
text: scouting the endless rows.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: See anything?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (holding one up)
dialog: How about these?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jack, for crying out loud. Your
dialog: bachelorhood's showing.
dialog: (seeing something)
dialog: Ah, here we go.
text: Frank grabs a pretty blue pump and gestures to the
text: SALESMAN, who's waiting on a woman.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey! Do these come in black?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: I'll be with you in a minute, sir.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't have a minute, pal. Yes
dialog: or no?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: (glowering)
dialog: Yes. They come in black.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay. Give me a pair of nines.
dialog: Pronto.
text: The Salesman looks casually at Jack.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Does he want a pair, too?
scene_heading: INT. DRESS DEPARTMENT
text: As Jack and Frank return to the dress department,
text: Frank jettisons the shoebox and tissue paper.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: All right, we got your shoes.
text: Just then, Susie steps out of the dressing room.
text: Even Frank stops at the sight of her.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh... good.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (turning to Jack)
dialog: Zip me up?
text: The dress is open down to the small of her back.
dialog: It's a nice back.
text: Jack takes the zipper and closes the panels carefully.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Shoes?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Right.
text: Frank puts the shoes down and Susie steps into them.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: They're tight.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They're nines.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Well, they're aspiring to be
dialog: sevens.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You can buy new ones tomorrow.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Oh, thanks.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't worry. We'll take it out
dialog: of your share.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: You're a prince.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL
text: As the trio rushes into the hotel service entrance,
text: RAY, the assistant manager, appears.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You better buy yourself a watch,
dialog: Frankie.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We had a little emergency.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Yeah, well, I've got a little emergency.
dialog: You know what I'm saying?
dialog: (seeing Susie)
dialog: Who's this, Minnie Pearl?
text: All eyes turn to Susie's dress, which still has the
text: tags attached.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (moving off)
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I want seventy-five minutes, Frankie.
dialog: You hear me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This is going well, isn't it?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: The three rush into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We need scissors over here!
dialog: Who's got scissors?
dialog: (turning to Susie)
dialog: Okay, remember. Jack and I go on first,
dialog: I do the set-up, then introduce you.
dialog: And you say ...
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
dialog: I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.
text: It's like a dream come true.
dialog: And speaking of dreams ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Piece of cake.
text: A tiny MAN in an apron walks up with a meat cleaver.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Carlos, that's,a cleaver. I need
text: scissors.
speaker_heading: CARLOS (MAN)
text: No scissors.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesus Christ. All right. Let's
dialog: go, Jack. Fix your tie.
text: Jack and Frank exit.
text: Susie stares a little warily at Carlos and his cleaver.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE
text: Jack and Frank slide quickly behind their pianos.
text: About half the tables in the room are filled.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
dialog: Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge.
dialog: My name's Frank Baker and no, you're not
dialog: seeing double, it's just my
dialog: little brother, Jack.
text: Some laughter.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm glad you're all in such a good mood tonight,
dialog: because we've got a very special
dialog: evening planned ...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Susie sits on a stool while Carlos positions the dress tags
text: on a cutting board. As a WAITRESS from the bar passes by,
text: Susie snares a drink from her tray.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Just a sip. To kill the
dialog: butterflies, okay?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Okay. But no lipstick.
text: Susie takes a quick sip.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: There. No one's the wiser.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Nice dress.
text: As the Waitress exits, Carlos brings the cleaver down
text: with a sharp chop, severing the tags.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Appreciate it, Ace.
speaker_heading: LOUNGE
text: The audience is laughing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But seriously, folks, as I sit here tonight,
dialog: looking out on all your kind faces, I can't help
dialog: but feel some of us have met before. We may not
dialog: know each other's names, we might not recognize
text: one another on the street, but we know each other
dialog: just the same. And over the years we've shared
text: something. A little music, a little drink,
text: a little laughter, maybe even... a few tears.
dialog: But I guess that's what friends are for, huh?
text: Applause. Jack puts out his cigarette.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, brother.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And it's especially nice to be among friends
dialog: tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special
dialog: night for my brother and I. This evening we've
dialog: asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I
dialog: are sure will soon seem like just another old
dialog: friend to you all. She's making her debut here
dialog: this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she
dialog: couldn't be doing it in a better place.
dialog: Because there's one place that's always been for
dialog: us a very special place, and that place is this
dialog: place, the Ambassador Lounge. Ladies and gentlemen,
dialog: please welcome a very special lady with a very
dialog: special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
text: Applause. Susie strides out of the kitchen, past the
text: busing station, and up to the microphone stand, which,
text: unfortunately, is not on.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing; whispering)
text: The switch. Hit the switch.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Switch?
dialog: (as she hits it)
dialog: What fucking switch?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing; very demure)
dialog: Pardon me.
text: Jack and Frank look at one another, then, before
text: outrage can set in, plunge into the opening number.
text: Susie takes the mike from the stand and smiles sweetly.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I can't tell you how thrilled I
dialog: am to be here.
text: For the moment, the audience doesn't seem quite sure
dialog: how thrilled they are to be here.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm all smiles, darling
dialog: Through and through...'
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY
text: A BELLBOY exits the elevator and, hearing Susie's voice
text: coming from the lounge, stops.
text: He looks to the CLERK behind the front desk.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: I thought the Bakers were on
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: They are.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Well, who's that?
text: The Clerk looks up from the register and listens.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I don't know. Frank?
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE
text: Judging from the faces, Susie's as big a hit in the
text: lounge as she is in the lobby. Head thrown back, eyes
text: closed, she sings with abandon, finishing on a long
text: extended note, then swooping down in a dramatic,
text: exhausted bow. There is a split second of silence,
text: then thunderous applause. Magic.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL
text: The new trio, fresh off their first gig,
text: come out of the service entrance into the night.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fucking. She says fucking in
text: front of an entire room of people.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I said I was sorry.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Did you hear it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fucking.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais
dialog: by the time I got out there anyway.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (directly to her)
dialog: Fucking.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: For Christ sake, I said it, I
dialog: didn't do it.
dialog: (pulling out some bills)
dialog: Besides, I don't think they were
dialog: too offended, do you?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (grabbing the bills)
dialog: Give me that.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We are not a saloon act. We do
dialog: not take tips from dirty old men.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (innocent)
dialog: I was gonna split it with you guys.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We do not take tips. I'll apply
dialog: this to the cost of the dress.
text: Frank puts the money in his pocket. Susie stares at
text: him, steaming.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Then I want my name on the poster.
dialog: And my picture!
dialog: (taking off her shoes)
dialog: And these shoes are too goddamn tight!
text: Susie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot.
text: Jack is leaning against the wall,
text: watching it all with amusement.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nice girl.
text: ON Frank's expression we hear the OPENING NOTES of
dialog: "New York, New York" and we see:
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: Susie and the boys performing it in one lounge after
text: another, playing to increasingly enthusiastic audiences,
text: no empty tables now.
text: As the SONG ends, we CLOSE ON the cardboard stand-up,
text: newly done over with a picture of Susie and an
text: accompanying exclamation: "See the Sensational Susie
text: Diamond!" As the FINAL CHORD sounds we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LLOYD'S OFFICE
text: Jack and Frank, once again in the office of the
text: supercilious Lloyd, waiting as he prepares their
dialog: cash envelope.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Yes, sir. That's quite a girl you boys latched
dialog: onto. She a local?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Born and bred.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Lucky for you. Well, there you go, guys.
dialog: Don't spend it all in one place.
dialog: Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We trust you, Lloyd. You know
dialog: that.
text: Frank takes the envelope and begins to leave.
speaker_heading: LLOYD
dialog: Say, Frankie. Since I've got you here...
dialog: How's next week look for you guys?
text: Frank glances at Jack, giving it to him.
text: Jack's eyes go cold.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We'll call you.
text: As Lloyd's face drops, Jack and Frank step into the
text: hallway and begin to walk slowly away, playing it cool,
text: then glance at one another and begin to walk faster
text: because they're about to burst out laughing.
scene_heading: FOLLOWING SHOT
text: By the time they reach the lobby, they are laughing,
text: tripping across the carpet, out the front entrance and
text: onto the sidewalk, where their voices explode in the
text: night air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz
text: together, laughing giddily, until they see - standing
text: under an awning, lighting a cigarette - Susie, watching
text: them with raised eyebrows. Jack and Frank, frozen in a
text: clumsy embrace, quickly disengage and begin clearing
text: their throats and squaring their cuffs. Susie exhales
text: a plume of smoke, studies them a moment,
text: then smiles slightly.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Night, Bakers.
text: As she turns away, Jack glances up, watching her
text: trim shadow disappear down the street.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY
text: Gray and cold. The streets swept with rain.
text: And once again the tentative piano:
text: "JINGLE BELLS, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
dialog: Oh what fun it is to ride ...
dialog: Oh what fun it is to ride ... Oh what fun..."
scene_heading: INT. VETERINARY CLINIC
text: Jack and Eddie are sitting in the waiting room:
text: small and dirty and packed with pet owners and
dialog: their animals.
text: After a moment, a WOMAN with a clipboard appears.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Barker.
dialog: (no takers)
dialog: Jock Barker?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (realizing it's him)
dialog: Baker. Jack Baker.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Right. Bring him back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on, Ed.
text: Jack and Eddie follow the Woman down a corridor.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker.
dialog: The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: He doesn't bite.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: They never do, Mr. Barker.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Baker.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Right. In there.
text: The Woman points Jack and Eddie into a small room.
text: There is an examining table, a sink, and on the wall,
text: a chart detailing the various breeds of dogs and cats.
text: Jack glances around the room, then comes back to Eddie,
text: who's staring up at him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You shoulda brushed, pal.
text: Just then, a MAN in a white coat breezes in.
speaker_heading: DR. BEASLEY (MAN)
dialog: Ah, labradorus retreiverus. Good fellows.
text: Quiet, but able to appreciate a good joke.
text: Dr. Beasley pats Eddie on the side, then turns to Jack.
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
dialog: Beasley.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Baker.
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
dialog: What's our friend's problem?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Teeth.
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
dialog: What's wrong with them?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: They're falling out.
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
dialog: Uh-oh. That's not good. Let's
dialog: get him up here.
text: Jack lifts Eddie up onto the table and Dr. Beasley opens
text: Eddie's mouth for a look. It doesn't take long.
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
dialog: They gotta go.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (a take)
dialog: How many?
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
dialog: Five's my guess. Maybe more.
dialog: Won't know till I get in there.
dialog: (consulting his clipboard)
dialog: Leave him now and you can pick
text: him up in the morning.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Isn't there something you can
dialog: give him? A pill or something?
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
text: Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to
text: the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest.
dialog: Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that,
dialog: would we?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How will he eat?
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
dialog: Start him out on cottage cheese.
dialog: If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a
dialog: few minutes. Go down like pudding
text: through a hot pipe.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No bones?
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
dialog: No bones.
text: Jack looks at Eddie.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you do to him?
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
dialog: Don't worry, Mr. Baker. We'll knock him out.
dialog: He won't feel a thing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I think maybe I'll bring him back
dialog: next week ...
scene_heading: DR. BEASLEY
dialog: The sooner we do this the better,
dialog: Mr. Baker.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Jack steps out onto the rainy street alone.
text: He glances back at the vet's with second thought,
text: then moves slowly off.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT
text: Jack enters with a small grocery bag and opens the
text: refrigerator. A carton of cream, a few eggs --
text: there's not much there. He takes a small container of
text: cottage cheese from the grocery bag and places it on an
text: empty shelf. As he closes the refrigerator door, he
text: glances around the apartment. It is very still, very
text: quiet. He looks up at the ceiling absently, then walks
text: over to the window and looks out. There is a mug of
text: coffee there on the sill. He takes it and holds it in
text: both hands for a moment, then places it back on the sill.
text: He sits at the piano and runs his fingers lightly over
text: the ivory, not making a sound, then places his hands on
text: the keys and begins to play. "Jingle Bells."
scene_heading: INT. CORNER DINER
text: In the front window, room has been made among the
text: photographs for one of Susie. Inside, Jack, Frank
text: and Susie sit at a table, surrounded by empty coffee
text: cups and cigarettes. Frank has several slips of paper
text: before him with names and dates.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The twenty-third ... Yeah, here it is. We got the
text: Carlton or the Plaza. Four day turns.
dialog: What do you think, Jack?
text: Jack is staring out the window.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Jack, you with us?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: The Carlton's a dump. No cover. No minimum.
text: And they water their drinks.
dialog: It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
text: Susie, as she says this, is pouring sugar into her Coke.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (watching)
dialog: I guess it's,the Plaza then.
dialog: That brings us to the twenty-seventh.
dialog: We got the Avedon for three or the Park
text: downtown for two.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: We take the Avedon, right? Simple.
text: Frank rubs his chin and looks at Jack. Jack shakes
text: his head.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The Park? It's only two nights.
dialog: Why throw away a night?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Because Blackie Carson books the Park and
dialog: whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (lifting her glass)
dialog: Well, for Blackie then.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: By the way, I got a messsage
dialog: yesterday from some guy looking for
text: New Year's action. Resort, upstate.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (likes "resort')
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sounds like a booking agent
dialog: looking to book an easy fee.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's what I figure. Probably have us in
text: a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Maybe it's legit.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe. I'll call him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Make it collect.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (shuffling his slips)
dialog: That's it except for the first.
dialog: We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the
text: Holiday Inn on Sixtieth. All three-day turns.
text: Frank looks at Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Draw.
text: Susie shrugs.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: How'd you guys used to decide what
dialog: gig to take?
text: Jack and Frank exchange a glance.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: So find a dime. Let's get out
dialog: of here.
scene_heading: EXT. DINER
text: Jack and Frank step out-of the diner and turn their
text: collars up against the chill.
text: Frank pulls on a pair of gloves.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year.
dialog: Where're your gloves?
text: Jack shrugs.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Better take care of your fingers, little brother.
dialog: Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't
dialog: be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll take my chances.
text: Frank pats his hands together and glances into the street.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Something, huh? All those bids.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. Something.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You wanna get a drink?
text: Frank stops, surprised.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, I... Little Frank's got strep. Donna's been
dialog: up two nights making sure the rest of us
dialog: don't get it.
text: Jack nods.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, fine.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right.
text: As Frank leaves, he takes a glance at his brother,
text: then disappears around the corner. A second later,
text: Susie comes out of the diner.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Where's egghead?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: His kid's sick.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (searching her purse)
dialog: I don't know. It's hard figuring you two
dialog: as brothers. Seems like the hospital might've
text: scrambled the babies somewhere.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: He takes after our mother.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be
dialog: one crazy dame. Shit.
text: Jack offers his pack of cigarettes.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Uh-uh. I never touch American
dialog: cigarettes.
dialog: (still searching)
dialog: What's tomorrow again?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The Stratford.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Nice place. Fulla velvet. Even
text: the bedspreads.
dialog: (shaking the purse)
dialog: Damn! Two-fifty a pack and I go
dialog: through 'em like toothpicks.
dialog: Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece,
dialog: you believe that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
text: Paris Opals. Twelve-and-a-half cents. I sat
dialog: down with a pencil and added it one day. But
dialog: I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something
dialog: in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.
dialog: (finding one)
dialog: Ah, here's a lost soul.
text: Jack lights it. She takes a draw.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Mmm. Like kissing a rose. Well,
dialog: au revoir.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey.
dialog: (as she stops)
dialog: You feel like a cup of coffee?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: You kidding? We must've killed three pots in
dialog: there. Anyway, I gotta get home. Rest the pipes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You want me to walk you?
text: Susie looks at Jack a little funny.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: No. Thanks.
text: She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, listen. You're not going soft on me, are
dialog: you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me
text: and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like
dialog: I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I mean, that'd be too creepy.
dialog: With us working together and all.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Nothing personal --
text: Jack holds up his hand. Susie just stands there.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Better hurry. You're a nickel
dialog: down on your cigarette.
scene_heading: EXT. VETERINARY CLINIC
text: Jack paces outside the veterinary clinic, rubbing his
text: arms against the night's chill. He glances up at the
text: flickering sign over the building: "Twenty-Four Hour
text: Emergency Care." Inside, a KID with deep-set eyes is
text: bent over a magazine. Jack hesitates then enters.
scene_heading: INT. VETERINARY CLINIC
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah?
text: Jack glances around, ill at ease.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You want something, pal? If you're looking for a
dialog: bathroom, try the Super Chief around the corner.
text: The Kid goes back to his magazine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning.
dialog: He needed some work on his mouth.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Regular hours are eight to five.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, yeah, I know. I was just passing by.
dialog: Thought I'd check in on him.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You can check in on him tomorrow.
dialog: Between eight and five.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, well, couldn't I take a
dialog: look now?
text: The Kid looks up at Jack with mild contempt.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You want to know if he's okay.
dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: All right. Hold on.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The name's Baker --
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Save it. What's he look like?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Black. Labrador.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: All right. they lay the dead ones out in the
dialog: cold room. I'll take a look.
text: The Kid disappears into the back. Jack stands frozen,
text: watching the swinging door come to rest. He looks
text: like a man who, unexpectedly, finds a razor pressed
text: to his neck. He fumbles for a cigarette, but doesn't
text: light it. He waits. A moment later, the door swings
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: KID
text: Nope. Just a couple poodles.
text: Jack nods, then, moving stiffly, leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. VETERINARY CLINIC
text: Outside, he reaches into his coat and takes the bottle.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT
text: On the floor, a long line of bowls, each containing
text: a different concoction, all intended for the ailing Eddie.
text: Eddie, lying a few feet away, shows no interest.
text: In the kitchen, Jack is heating something up in a pan.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: I tried Cheerios this morning.
text: He didn't even get up.
dialog: Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He's just feeling sorry for himself. This is it,
dialog: pal. Hear me? Two bucks a can.
text: Jack dumps some brown slop into a bowl and places it next
text: to the others. Nina and he wait. At first, nothing, then
text: ... Eddie's eyes move. His nose twitches.
text: His head lifts. Finally, he gets up and walks to the
text: bowl. He eats.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Chili.
speaker_heading: CITY
text: draped in winter. Dark skies, people lost in heavy
text: coats, the city's battered Christmas decorations hung
text: tenuously across traffic-clogged streets. Over it all
text: we hear "JINGLE BELLS," PLAYED for the first time
text: completely through, hesitantly but without error.
dialog: As the SONG ENDS, we are:
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT
text: watching Nina strike the final chord triumphantly.
text: She turns to Jack, who's been listening from the couch.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (nodding to the ceiling)
dialog: You're gonna knock her dead, kid.
scene_heading: INT. LUAU LOUNGE
text: All done up in reds and greens for Christams Eve.
text: Jack, Frank and Susie -- each decked out in their own
text: little Santa hats -- perform "Silver Bells" for the
text: happy crowd. Jack, smoking a cigarette, will not be
text: mistaken for Santa Claus, but Susie looks adorable.
text: Frank just looks happy. As they finish,
text: the crowd applauds.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Jack, now sans Santa hat, enters the bathroom off the
text: lobby and finds Santa Claus standing in front of the
text: mirror, fussing with his beard.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You recognized me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just a lucky guess.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So what do you think?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Very realistic.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (not buying it)
dialog: Yeah, well, what can I say? Dad must've had
dialog: forty pounds on me.
dialog: Jesus, you remember him being this big?
text: Jack looks in the mirror.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother.
dialog: Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY
text: Jack and Frank step out into the lobby, thus giving
text: a few people, Susie among them, the curious privilege
text: of seeing Santa Claus exit a men's room.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You want to come out to the house tomorrow?
dialog: The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided
dialog: to really lay it on. Turkey, stuffing, the
dialog: whole bit. Kitchen's so full of food you can
dialog: hardly move. We could use another appetite.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thanks, but I've got plans.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: All right, but if you change your mind,
dialog: let me know. I gotta go get Ma in the
dialog: morning anyway.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (coming up)
dialog: Well, well. Ho, ho, ho. You
dialog: moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: For the kids.
dialog: (moving off)
dialog: Merry Christmas, you two. Don't
dialog: forget. We leave the twenty-sixth.
text: Frank pushes through the revolving door and steps
text: out into the street in his Santa suit.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: He do that every year?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Every year.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Aren't the kids asleep?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Every year.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: So why's he do it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I guess in case one year they're not.
text: Jack looks into Susie's eyes, then crosses to the
text: door and exits. Susie watches him go, then turns to
text: the desk clerk.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Call me a cab, will ya?
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT
text: As Jack enters his apartment, he senses a presence in
text: the room and looks over to the old phone booth.
text: Nina is sitting inside on the little stool, her head
text: tilted against the glass. Jack studies her a moment,
text: then takes the carton of eggnog he's carrying into the
text: kitchen and grabs a pair of glasses. He pulls a chair
text: over to the phone booth and sits down.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: How'd the show go?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay. How'd yours go?
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Not so good.
text: Jack looks at Nina's face, tender and young in the
text: soft shadows of the booth. After a moment, her eyes
text: shift to the carton in his hand.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Eggnog?
text: Jack nods.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: From Hurley's?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Eighty proof. What d'ya say?
dialog: Think you can handle it?
text: Nina nods. Jack begins to fill the two glasses.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Can I stay here tonight? Even if
dialog: she comes here?
text: Jack pauses a moment, then closes the carton and sets
dialog: it aside.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure.
text: He hands Nina her glass, then takes his own.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: Merry Christmas, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Merry Christmas.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING
text: Jack and Nina are standing in the middle of the room,
text: looking down at something.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: What do you think?
text: Eddie, outfitted in a brand new, spanking red dog
text: sweater, stares up at Jack and Nina, wondering why
text: he's the object of so much attention.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Very cool.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - JACK, NINA AND EDDIE
dialog: (sporting his new sweater)
text: make their way across an empty cemetery.
text: Nina is swinging a bottle of whiskey.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: There were more flowers last year. Mr. Rinaldi
text: down at the drugstore says it's going to snow
text: by New Year's. Says he can feel it in his elbows.
dialog: I hope it snows. I want to make a snowman.
dialog: You ever make a snowman, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: That's what I want to do.
dialog: I want to make a snowman.
text: As they come to a plot of ground, they stop.
text: There are two matching headstones, one for Jack's father,
text: fully engraved, and another for Jack's mother, bearing
text: only her name. Jack studies the plot a moment, then
text: crouches before his father's marker: "ANDREW S. BAKER.
dialog: Adoring Husband of Eleanor, Loving Father of Franklin
text: and John." Jack brushes some dirt from the face of the
text: stone, then stands.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now?
text: Jack nods. Nina uncaps the whiskey bottle and pours
text: it onto the dead man's grave.
speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Merry Christmas, Mr. Baker.
text: They stand another moment, just looking, then turn away.
text: As they begin to walk, Jack sees Eddie in his new
text: sweater sniffing at a gravestone.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, Eddie. Have some respect,
dialog: will ya?
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING
text: Jack is sitting on a suitcase in front of his building.
text: A moment later, Frank pulls the car up to the curb and
text: Jack gets in. Susie is sitting up front.
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: Frank, burning with the afterglow of a holiday spent
text: with family, cheerfully maneuvers the car
text: through the city.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So. How was everyone's Christmas?
text: Jack and Susie stare disconsolately out the window.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Too early, huh? Well, there's coffee and donuts
dialog: for whoever wants them.
dialog: How about a maple bar, Jack?
text: Jack shakes his head and takes out a cigarette.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Uh, Jack ... if you don't mind.
text: Jack stares at the back of Frank's head,
text: then puts the cigarette away. Susie takes a peek in
text: the donut bag and looks a little sick.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: By the way, if anyone gets bored,
dialog: Donna packed some travel games.
text: They work wonders with the kids.
text: Frank reaches under the seat and hands Susie a sack
text: full of magnetic games, puzzles, and plastic cubes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You two could play checkers.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Sorry. It only plays static.
text: Susie looks at the radio,
text: then at the games in her hands.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: How long did you say it takes to
dialog: get to this place?
scene_heading: INT. CAR - FEW HOURS LATER
text: Jack is staring out the window at the winter landscape,
text: an unlit cigarette dangling from his lip.
text: Susie is gnawing on a donut, deeply obsessed with an
text: elaborate plastic puzzle.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Any more coffee?
text: Susie snaps out of her trance and shakes the Thermos.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Uh-uh. Hey, what's this?
text: Susie notices an old, leather-bound ledger. Inside,
text: there are hundreds of tiny entries.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You play all these places?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Baker's unabridged.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of
dialog: noise. What's with the stars?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Virgins.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Virgins?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: First times. Hey, look at this.
text: A crepe-covered car surrounded by several other
text: HONKING VEHICLES passes by. Jack stares at the beaming
text: newlyweds as they glide past his window,
text: two kids starting life in a beat-up Eldorado
text: covered with toilet paper.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: When's the last time we played a
dialog: wedding, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Two years ago. March.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (consulting the ledger)
dialog: He's right.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He's always right. Go ahead. Pick a virgin.
text: Susie looks at Frank curiously.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (scanning the book)
dialog: Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (staring out the window)
dialog: November. '71.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: First night?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Day. Wednesday.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Last?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sunday.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I don't believe it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I told you, he's got the gift. Same with music.
dialog: Hears it once and he's got it.
text: Frank smiles into the rear view mirror.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: My brilliant little brother.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL
text: The hotel, done in a sort of King Arthur motif,is
text: built right on the ocean. Frank guides the car down
text: a simulated cobblestone drive and the three get out.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Will you listen to that ocean?
text: It's LOUD. Frank takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And how about this air? I'm telling you,
dialog: a few days in this place'll put five years
dialog: on your life.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
text: Smells like fish.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Of course it smells like fish.
dialog: We're on the ocean.
dialog: What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (to herself)
text: Smells like tuna number two to me.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's paradise. That's what it is.
dialog: Paradise.
text: As Susie and Jack follow Frank up the drive, Jack
text: notices the beat-up Eldorado in the parking lot,
text: its toilet paper streamers blowing
text: gently in the ocean breeze.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY
text: The lobby is done in royal reds and blues and there
text: are a lot of swords on the walls.
text: Franks steps up to the front desk.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hi, we're the Fabulous Baker Boys.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Glad to meet you. I'm Terrific
dialog: Tom.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. We're the entertainment.
speaker_heading: TOM (CLERK)
dialog: Oh, right, gotcha. You got bags?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Outside. Blue Chevy.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (ringing a bell)
dialog: Cyril. Chevy. Blue. Take 'em up
text: to the Guinevere Suite.
text: A lanky boy in velvet jodhpurs and high stockings ambles
text: out for the bags. Tom hands Frank the room keys.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (continuing)
text: Right on the ocean, Mr. Baker.
dialog: You can practically dangle your toes
text: in the water.
scene_heading: INT. SUITE
text: Tom wasn't kidding. The immediacy of the ocean beyond
text: the window is almost scary.

dialog: You believe this? I'm telling you, we're getting
text: away with murder. Two shows a night and the rest
dialog: of the time we live like kings. It's a crime.
text: Jack stares at the ocean, then at the two beds placed
text: side by side. Suddenly Susie comes through the bathroom.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Hey, we're connected.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Great?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah.
text: Susie shrugs and returns to her room through the
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I thought we had separate rooms.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (opening drawers)
dialog: We do. She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey.
dialog: Wash and Dries.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I thought we all had separate rooms.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on, Jack. It's not like it's the first
dialog: time we've bunked together. It'll be like when
dialog: we were kids. Relax. Enjoy the view.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
text: Jack, Frank and Susie are in the dining room, which,
text: like their rooms, looks out over the ocean.
text: Dinner is over and they're well
text: through a second bottle of wine.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: You're kidding me.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Peggy Lee?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tell her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She was staying at the Grand
dialog: downtown ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It was April. April seventeenth.
dialog: That one I remember.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We were playing the lounge one
dialog: night and she came in.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Pearls. White gown. Beautiful.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said
dialog: yes, and we did a few bars.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A few bars!
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: What'd she sing?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: People.' You think Streisand, right?
text: Hot that night. Chills.
text: Through the whole audience. I could hardly play.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Wow. You ever see her again?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. We got a picture, though.
text: One of the waitresses had a camera.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: God, we were just kids. That was
dialog: something, wasn't it?
text: Jack nods. Frank shakes his head, still lost in the
text: spring evening years before, then notices the newlyweds
text: sitting across the room.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, will you look at that?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: They must've bought the same
dialog: map we did.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What do you say we send a bottle
dialog: over?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I don't believe it. You're a
dialog: romantic, Frank.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: He's drunk.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not true. Besides, Jack's the romantic.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He's just afraid to show it.
dialog: Aren't you, little brother?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Have some more wine, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good idea.
dialog: (lifting his glass)
dialog: To Peggy Lee.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Frank, standing, dressed in pajamas.
text: Jack is staring out the window at the darkness.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm putting my stuff on the right,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I figure that way we won't get confused.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Unless you want the right.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, you take the right.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We might as well do the towels the same way.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I just figure things'll go smoother, you know,
dialog: if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good idea.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But if it doesn't work out, let
dialog: me know. I'm,flexible.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right.
text: Frank nods and moves to the bed.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing; re: the bathroom light)
dialog: You leaving that on?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: All night?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're gonna be here a week?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So you're gonna leave it on.
dialog: Every night. For a week.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah. You mind?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why would I mind?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know. I mean, I always did it as a kid.
dialog: I figured it was no big deal. Is it? A big deal?
text: Jack just stares at Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh. I didn't know. I mean, I always did it as a kid.
dialog: It was never a big deal then. Was it?
text: Jack just stares at Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh. Well. You want me to turn
dialog: it off?
text: Jack just stares at Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'll turn it off.
text: Jack turns back to the window.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Forget it. It's no big deal.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
text: The next morning. Jack and Frank are standing
text: in a huge dining room, appraising two elegant grands.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They're beauties, huh?
text: Jack steps up to one and runs his hand over the keys.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Reminds me of those Steinways Willie used to have.
text: Frank taps a few notes on his piano, humming happily.
text: Jack begins to echo his brother's notes, listening.
text: After a moment, Frank notices.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What?
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
text: A short, stubby LITTLE MAN in a charcoal suit strides
text: into the dining room, followed by Terrific Tom.
scene_heading: MR. DANIELS (LITTLE MAN)
dialog: Good morning, gentlemen. I'm Mr. Daniels,
dialog: the manager. I believe I've spoken to one of you
text: on the phone.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (offering his hand)
dialog: That'd be me, sir. Frank Baker.
dialog: This is my brother Jack.
text: Jack, slouched against the piano, smoking, nods.
speaker_heading: MR. DANIELS
dialog: Tom here tells me there's a problem with the
text: pianos. We were assured they were in tune.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes, well, they are.
speaker_heading: MR. DANIELS
dialog: Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: They are in tune. But not with
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: MR. DANIELS
dialog: Is that important?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh, well ...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes. It's important.
text: Frank glances nervously at Jack.
speaker_heading: MR. DANIELS
dialog: Tom, who're we dealing with on
dialog: these?
speaker_heading: TOM
text: A Mr. Reynolds, sir. But he's gone on vacation.
dialog: I called this morning.
speaker_heading: MR. DANIELS
dialog: Well, gentlemen, I don't know what to say.
dialog: Not being a musician myself I find it difficult
dialog: to grasp the magnitude of this. I don't suppose
dialog: there's any way you could just ... accommodate.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Accommodate? I don't think I know
dialog: what you mean.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say,
dialog: Jack, is --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell
dialog: us what he's trying to say.
speaker_heading: MR. DANIELS
dialog: I assure you, Mr. Baker, no offense is intended.
dialog: I simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Frank dogs Jack down a hallway.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like
text: a kid.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, that's your problem, Frank. You get around
dialog: one of these assholes and you turn into a
dialog: fucking three-year-old.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's the matter with you? So the piano's a
dialog: little out of tune. So what?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (stopping)
dialog: Christ, can't you hear it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No! I never hear it!
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know.
dialog: But I won't let it bother me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Doesn't it matter to you?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What matters to me is we've got the six easiest
dialog: nights we've had in ten years.
dialog: So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat.
dialog: So what? Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack. Nobody.
dialog: So why should you care?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Because I can hear it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because
dialog: come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that
text: dining room with smiles on.
dialog: Understand, little brother?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM
text: Frank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror.
text: Jack, sitting at the window, his foot up against the
text: glass, drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean
text: goes dark. After a moment, Susie enters wearing a
text: little tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Hey, fellas. What's the word?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's with you two?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Jack woke up on the wrong side
text: of the bottle.
text: Susie looks at Jack. Then Frank.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: 0-kay.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE
text: As Jack, Frank and Susie perform "Strangers in the Night,"
text: dozens of couples move slowly on the dance floor,
text: while others sit at candle-lit tables, sipping cocktails.
text: As the song ends, the couples applaud.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thank you, thank you.
dialog: (as applause dies)
dialog: You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived
dialog: here yesterday, but already the people here at the
dialog: King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel,
dialog: well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that,
dialog: before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part
dialog: of that family also. So, if during-the next few days,
dialog: we should happen to pass one another in the hallway
dialog: or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger.
dialog: Stop. Say hello. Introduce yourself. Because here,
text: there are no strangers, only friends.
dialog: And family. Right, Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right. I love you, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I love you. I just wanted to say it.
text: Frank stares incredulously at Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.
dialog: (moving quickly along)
dialog: So. Susie. How 'bout it.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Got another song for us?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well then ... shall we?
speaker_heading: BACKSTAGE
text: Frank corners Jack as they exit the stage.
text: Susie looks around nervously to see if anyone's watching.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: What's the matter with you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sorry, Frank. All that talk about family.
dialog: I just got emotional.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How dare you say you love me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It won't happen again. Scout's
dialog: honor.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: What's with you guys?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Someone needs to grow up. I won't
dialog: take it, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure you will.
text: Jack pushes past Frank and leaves.
text: Frank watches him go, then turns to leave himself.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Middle of the night. Jack, fully clothed,
text: is sitting on the rim of the tub, smoking.
text: Susie enters.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Oh, sorry. With the light always
text: on, it's hard to tell.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's okay.
dialog: (the cigarette)
dialog: Last one.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Can't sleep?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: In and out.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: It's the waves. God's music, my mother used to say.
dialog: She was crazy for the ocean.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, well, I wish God would go
text: a little easy on the trumpets.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: How's egghead?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Like a baby. You?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
text: In and out.
text: Jack nods. Susie looks at him carefully.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: If you want, I got a pack in the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No thanks. I never touch French
dialog: cigarettes.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - DAY
text: The next morning. As Jack passes through the lobby,
text: he hears the plaintive PLINKING of a PIANO. Curious,
text: he goes to the dining room and peers in.
text: The tables have yet to be set for the evening and,
text: except for Frank, the room is empty.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: What's it look like I'm doing?
dialog: I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes, really. I don't want you to be unhappy,
dialog: Jack. If you say it's out of tune,
text: it's out of tune.
text: Jack smiles to himself and crosses the room.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How's it coming?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How long you been at it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Half-hour. Once I finish this octave I'm gonna
dialog: get breakfast. You see what's on the buffet?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They stopped serving two hours ago.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Two hours ago!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Time flies, huh?
text: Frank looks despairingly at the pianos.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I could give you a hand. If
dialog: you want.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Jack and Frank are eating lunch. Frank has a tiny
text: stack of blue cards he's perusing.
text: He holds one out to Jack.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What do you make that? Paruchi?
text: Jack nods. Frank continues to go through the cards
text: as he speaks.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You haven't seen Susie, have you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. Why?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just wonder what she's up to.
dialog: I never see her. Makes me nervous.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She's a big girl.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, well, she's our girl now. I think we better
dialog: keep an eye on her. There's trouble there.
dialog: (another card)
dialog: Hey, listen to this. Ethel and Bert Lane.
dialog: Married seventy-five years. You believe that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What the hell are these?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Dedications. I came up with the idea on the road.
dialog: See, every morning the maids drop one of these
text: cards in each room. The guest fills out the card,
text: leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play
dialog: it. Daniels went crazy for the idea.
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: And that's not all. Last night, after the nine
text: o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking
dialog: about our availability. Like he wants to line
dialog: something up.
dialog: I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Frank jumps. A WOMAN in a bright flowered gift shop
text: dress pokes her head in.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting
dialog: here, I just had to come over. Florence Simmons.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh ... Frank Baker. This is my
dialog: brother.
speaker_heading: FLORENCE SIMMONS (WOMAN)
dialog: Oh, I know, I know. My husband and I saw you
dialog: play last night and it's the most remarkable thing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh. Well, thank you.
scene_heading: FLORENCE SIMMONS
dialog: No, I mean you.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: I have a brother-in-law who looks exactly like you.
dialog: Exactly. You don't happen to have a Huckleberry
dialog: in your family tree, do you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Afraid not.
scene_heading: FLORENCE SIMMONS
dialog: Well, it's frightening. You could be his twin.
dialog: Of course, he doesn't have your talent. Musically,
dialog: I mean. He sharpens things for a living. Lawn
text: mower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge.
dialog: Can imagine?
text: Jack is having a hard time imagining Florence Simmons.
scene_heading: FLORENCE SIMMONS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Well, anyway, I just had to make sure there was
dialog: no relation. You play wonderfully. Both of you.
text: Florence Simmons gives a little flutter of
text: a wave and exits.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Funny, huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thinking there's someone who looks like you,
text: walking around the street somewhere.
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Wonder if I saw him I'd think it
dialog: was you?
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - DAY
text: Jack is standing on the walkway that encircles the
text: hotel, watching the waves tumble into one another.
text: As he starts to take out a cigarette, he notices
text: Florence Simmons standing a few yards away
text: with a camera.
scene_heading: FLORENCE SIMMONS
dialog: I just know my sister won't believe
dialog: me. Do you mind?
text: Jack shakes his head and Florence starts to aim the
text: camera.
scene_heading: FLORENCE SIMMONS
dialog: I really hate to impose. It's just that the
dialog: resemblance is so extraordinary.
dialog: (focusing)
dialog: I wonder if you could turn this way so your face
text: isn't in the shadows.
text: As Jack turns, he glances over Florence's swaying
text: shoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other
text: end of the walkway. They are leaning into the wind,
text: her hair blowing free, brushing the man's face.
scene_heading: FLORENCE SIMMONS
dialog: Say cheese.
text: The camera clicks.
scene_heading: FLORENCE SIMMONS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Gotcha. Would you like a copy for
dialog: yourself? The hotel develops.
text: Jack glances away from Susie and the man.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
text: ON Jack's expression APPLAUSE is heard and a moment
dialog: later we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: That evening. The trio has just finished a song and
text: those on the dance floor are clapping.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thank you. You know, before we came out here
dialog: this evening, Susie and Jack and I were looking
dialog: over your dedications and something struck us.
text: Susie and Jack look at Frank as if they have no idea
text: what he's talking about.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We realized that, well, we're really not so
dialog: different from one another after all. Oh sure,
dialog: we may be at different points in our journey,
dialog: but we all travel pretty much the same road.
dialog: And so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce
dialog: you to two very special couples. First, married
dialog: for all of two days, please say hello to Helen
dialog: and Bud Wilson. Helen. Bud.
text: Those standing on the dance floor applaud as the young
text: couple from the beat-up Eldorado make their way to the
text: front of the room.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And now, our second couple. I'm talking about
dialog: Ethel and Bert Lane, ladies and gentlemen. Now,
dialog: Ethel and Bert would be upset with me if I told
dialog: you they'd been married for fifty years. Why?
dialog: Because, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane
dialog: have been married for seventy-five years!
text: The audience lets go with an audible "ooh"
text: and applauds enthusiastically.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ethel, Bert. Get up here and
dialog: show these kids how it's done.
text: A path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make
text: their way to the dance floor.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Aren't they a sight?
text: They are indeed, and a sight slower getting to the
dialog: dance floor than Frank anticipated.
text: He nods to Jack and they launch into "The Anniversary
dialog: Waltz," but have to keep repeating the opening passage
text: while they wait for Ethel and Bert. Finally, everyone
text: on the dance floor steps back and, with some help from
text: a few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the
text: way, Ethel and Bert Lane begin to dance in the center
text: of the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger
text: couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Jack is sitting in the bathroom again, smoking. He
text: hears Susie's door open, then VOICES -- hers and a
text: man's. He puts out his cigarette in the
text: sink and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
text: The next morning. Frank, the early bird, is
text: returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm.
text: Whistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to
text: see a man exit Susie's room. Astonished, then outraged,
text: he goes to Susie's door and knocks sharply.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (opening door)
dialog: Forget your tie, handsome ...
dialog: Frank!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You want to tell me what the
dialog: hell's going on?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: I just saw a man walk out of
dialog: your room.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Uh ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be
dialog: here. So it might be nice if you conducted
dialog: yourself with a certain amount of decency.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Decency? Hey listen, pal ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. You listen. I had my doubts
dialog: about you from the beginning
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey!
text: Frank and Susie turn. Jack is standing in the hallway.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What're you trying to do? Wake
dialog: up the whole goddamn hotel?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We were just having a little
dialog: discussion about morality.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Some discussion.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I just saw a man walk out of your
dialog: room!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You saw wrong.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He's with the hotel. I called him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We had a leak in the bathroom.
dialog: He fixed it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: He was wearing a suit.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He had to come quickly. It was
text: a big leak.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How come I didn't hear anything?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're a heavy sleeper, Frank.
dialog: You've always-been a heavy sleeper.
dialog: (looking at Susie)
dialog: Unlike me.
text: Frank looks at Jack, then Susie.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I guess I ... If I jumped to...
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Forget it.
text: The three stand there awkwardly for a moment.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well...
text: Frank shrugs lamely and exits.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Boy, he comes on like a hurricane
dialog: in the morning, doesn't he?
text: Jack just stares at her.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Yeah, well, thanks for sticking
dialog: your head in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey, business is business.
text: He turns to leave. Susie's eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: It wasn't business. It was pleasure.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just dinner and dance, right?
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
text: Jack, Frank and Susie are sitting at a table in the
text: smaller dining room. It is conspicuously quiet.
text: The main course seems to be a conscious attempt to
text: ignore each other. Finally, Susie looks at Frank.
text: Then Jack. Then out the window.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Paradise.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack and Frank's room. It is New Year's Eve,
text: just before show time, and Jack and Frank are in
text: their tuxes. Frank is on the phone.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes, Daddy promises. I'll bring you one of the
dialog: little glasses, how's that? Just like Grandma has.
text: It has a picture of the hotel on it and everything
dialog: ... No, honey, they don't sell puppies here ...
dialog: Who? ... Well, we'll see. Let me talk to Mommy,
dialog: okay?... Okay,sweetheart. Happy New Year.
dialog: (waits)
dialog: Hi, honey. She says Angela Secoli got a puppy for
dialog: Christmas. Explain to her why we can't ... I don't
dialog: know, tell her you're allergic ... It's not lying.
dialog: Well, okay, it is lying, but ... All right, then tell
dialog: her I'll explain it ... He what? ... No kidding?
dialog: Without the training wheels?
dialog: (affected by this)
dialog: Well, that's great. Tell him, tell him. I can't wait
text: to see ... No, no new bike. Maybe for his birthday ...
dialog: Okay. Listen, honey, I have to go.We're on in ten
dialog: minutes ... Yeah, Happy New Year ... I love you ...
text: Frank sets the phone down and stares at it.
text: Jack studies him a moment, then Frank suddenly
text: claps his hands.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Well, let's go. The public waits.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A mass of swarming, jubilant people. The voices are
text: high and loud and there's not a hand without a
text: champagne glass. Couples lean into one another
text: intimately, dancing gaily between the tables, toasting
text: strangers without hesitation.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (yelling to be heard)
dialog: All right, everyone. This is it.
dialog: Let's hear it. Ten. Nine ...
text: Gradually, the entire room joins the chant.
scene_heading: FRANK/EVERYONE
dialog: Eight. Seven. Six. Five.
dialog: Four. Three. Two! ONE!
text: HAPPY NEW YEAR!
text: There is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to
dialog: find that certain someone to kiss in the new year.
text: In this moment, Jack, Frank and Susie find themselves
text: oddly removed from the frantic cheer below them,
text: their presence suddenly unnecessary, forgotten.
text: Finally, Susie walks over to Frank and gives him a kiss,
text: then goes to Jack. They hesitate, then kiss lightly,
text: pulling away and glancing awkwardly into each other's
text: eyes. Frank sounds the first chord of "Auld Lang Syne"
text: and Susie looks away from Jack and returns to her place
text: on the stage. As she begins to sing, the others in the
text: room, all intimate friends for one brief moment,
text: begin to sing with her.
scene_heading: SUSIE/EVERYONE
dialog: Lest old acquaintances be forgot ...
text: As the voices slowly fade, they are joined by the
text: sound of the OCEAN until the ocean is all we hear
dialog: and we see:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack, lying on his bed in the dark. He opens his eyes,
text: squinting against the light from the bathroom, then
text: glances over to Frank's bed and detects the outline
text: of a body in the darkness. Swinging his legs over the
text: side, he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes.
text: Suddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in
text: the next bed shifts, falling into the shaft of light cast
text: from the bathroom. It is a little boy. Startled, Jack
text: stares at the sleeping boy, then hears movement in the
text: bathroom. Rising slowly, he walks to the bathroom and
text: gently eases the door open a few inches. Inside, swimming
text: murkily in the steamy mirror, is the reflection of a man.
text: His back is to Jack, but Jack can see that the man is
text: shaving. As Jack lets his gaze drop to the floor, he sees
text: that water is dripping off the man's pant cuffs and
text: gathering in pools on the bathroom floor ... Jack wakes
text: up. He stares at the ceiling, listening to the waves,
text: then lifts his head and looks to the bathroom. It is
text: dark. Turning, he glances at Frank's bed. It's empty.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
text: Dark and soundless. Balloons, streamers and the other
text: debris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow.
text: Frank is sitting at the window, drinking as he stares at
text: the ocean. As Jack crosses the room, he looks up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ah, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear.
dialog: Happy New Year, little brother.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What're you doing down here?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Celebrating. Join me?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: The party's over.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, you're wrong. It's just beginning.
dialog: Come on, have a drink.
dialog: Show your big brother how it's done.
text: Frank pours him a glass. Jack notices the bottle.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Expensive hangover.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A gift. Courtesy of our courteous
text: hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.
dialog: (toasting Jack)
dialog: We, dear brother, are a fucking
dialog: smash.
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Yup. They want us back. Easter. It seems they
dialog: have this egg hunt every year. Only not for kids.
text: Adults. They stuff these plastic eggs with
dialog: Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais
text: and everyone has a grand time crawling around on
text: the front lawn. Then afterwards, they have a
text: dance. An egg dance. Everyone comes dressed in
text: a different colored shell and at the end of the
dialog: evening they crack themselves open. It's our job
text: to separate the yolks from the whites.
dialog: Slippery business.
text: Frank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink, then
text: leans his head back, staring at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know, I've never kissed my wife on New Year's.
dialog: Not once in twelve years.
text: Jack studies Frank as he stares at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: The Holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it?
text: With the blue glass.
text: Jack looks up at the chandelier.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The Royal.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Right. The Royal. When's the
dialog: last time we were there?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Couple years.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: February?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: April.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Right. It's incredible how you
dialog: do that. Remember things.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A useless talent.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Drove me crazy when we were kids.
dialog: The way you never looked at the music.
dialog: Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
text: Frank snaps his fingers.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They were simple songs.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Not for me. I still have to look at the music
dialog: sometimes, you know that? Otherwise, I forget.
dialog: I just forget. But you. You never forget.
dialog: Ever.
dialog: (turning)
dialog: So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I told you. It's a useless talent.
text: Frank studies Jack a moment, then stares out at the
dialog: ocean.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: God, the old man would've loved
dialog: this view, wouldn't he?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I always think of him on New Year's.
dialog: How he used to pour us each half a can of beer.
dialog: Remember?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You always threw up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice.
dialog: He loved that about you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He was just having fun.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It was like you'd passed some test,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It was just a can of beer, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, but he told you things. He never told me
dialog: anything. Even though I was the oldest.
dialog: It was always you two, running off, doing things
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You could've come.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I could've. But he didn't want
dialog: me to.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're making things up, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe so.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You ever go back there? Where it
dialog: happened.
text: Jack stares at the angry SEA, LOUD even through the
text: thick glass.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - DAY
text: The next morning. Jack is sitting outside the hotel,
text: watching HELEN and BUD WILSON pack up the Eldorado.
text: The streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal
text: to the car's exterior. After a moment, Frank exits with
text: a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a
text: tiny souvenir shot glass.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Want one?
text: Jack shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ah well, the kids'll break a
dialog: couple anyway.
text: Suddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the
text: newlyweds are heard.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Give me the keys.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You're not going to drive.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Give me the keys!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: You're not going to drive!
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: It's my goddamn car!
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It's our goddamn car!
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Give me the keys.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: No.
text: Bud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but
text: she's too quick and runs to the other side of the car.
text: Frustrated, he begins to run around the car like a
text: madman, trying to catch her. Finally, when he gets
text: close, she darts off, sprinting across the parking lot.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I think I'll warm up the car.
scene_heading: OVERVIEW - CITY
text: Cold, dark, dangerous, but somehow looking quite
text: appealing after a week in paradise.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: The trio, looking road-weary, is parked in front
text: of Jack's building. It is very late.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That takes care of this week. The tenth we
dialog: got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're
dialog: at the Capri.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: The tenth's out.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I can't make the tenth.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I mean maybe you should check with us before you
dialog: go off and book us a month in advance.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Be reasonable, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank.
dialog: How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
text: Jack gets out of the car. Frank shakes his head in
text: exasperation, then looks to Susie.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How about you? Got a Bar Mitzvah
dialog: this weekend?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Forget it.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT
text: Jack lets himself in and closes the door quietly.
text: In the darkness he can make out Nina and Eddie,
text: curled up on the couch, asleep. Above them,
text: hung carefully on a string, are some paper letters:
text: "WELCOME HOME."
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE
text: In a lounge whols basic decor makes abundant use of
dialog: several historical eras but which might best be described
text: as Modern Pilgrim, Jack, Susie and Frank perform
text: "Feelings," while waiters in huge Paul Revere hats pass
text: in and out of view.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings
dialog: ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ...
speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: Jack, Frank and Susie exit the lounge to applause.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I can't sing it anymore.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: That song. I can't sing it anymore.
dialog: I'm gonna get sick.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What're you talking about? They
dialog: love it.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I'm gonna throw up, Frank. I mean it.
dialog: Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (as to a child)
dialog: Susie. It's one more show. One
dialog: more time. That's all.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: And two more times tomorrow night, and two more
dialog: times the next night, and the next night and the
dialog: next night and the next night. Frank, I can't
dialog: sing that fucking song anymore!
text: She's yelling. The kitchen workers are glancing over.
text: Jack studies her as she tries to calm herself.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I need some air.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL
text: A few minutes later. Jack comes out of the hotel and
text: sees Susie pacing.
text: He sits down and watches her for a moment.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're gonna wear down those
dialog: heels if you don't give it a rest.
text: She stops.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Relax. We'll drop the song.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Guess I got a little scattered.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's a shitty song.
text: Susie nods and looks up at the glittering hotel.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: How do you do it? Every night?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Practice.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: There are worse songs, you know.
dialog: Not many, but a few.
text: Susie nods. Jack studies her. Something's on her
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Listen...
dialog: (looks into his eyes)
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DUSK
text: A record is spinning on Jack's phonograph as the sun
text: goes down outside his window. As we MOVE AWAY FROM
text: the phonograph and PAST the window, we FIND Jack at
text: the piano, playing along with the record,
text: lost in concentration.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Susie is working on a Paris Opal, pacing, occasionally
text: glancing up at Jack's apartment, where the MUSIC can be
text: heard FAINTLY. After a moment, she drops her cigarette
text: on the sidewalk. There are half a dozen others
text: already there.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT
text: The record finishes, but the needle doesn't pick up,
text: bumping into the label. Jack glances at the clock next
text: to him and gets up. He puts on a jacket, then takes a
text: pair of gloves and pulls them on carefully.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING
text: As Jack comes out of his building, Susie stops pacing,
text: surprised. Jack, wearing the same look of concentration
text: he had at the piano, doesn't see her and turns down the
text: other end of the street. Susie starts to call after
text: him, but stops.
scene_heading: EXT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
text: The sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky.
text: We see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB - NIGHT
text: Jack is sitting in the shadows near the stage, where
text: a trio is playing. He has a drink in front of him,
text: but it is untouched. After a moment, the trio finishes
text: and the pianist, a huge black man named HENRY, nods to
text: the applause.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Thank you. As most of you know, we like to shake
dialog: things up here every so often just to keep you
dialog: people on your toes. So I'm gonna take a little
dialog: rest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit
text: in. He drops by about once a year just to keep
dialog: his hands clean. Ladies and gentlemen.
dialog: Jack Baker.
text: Jack rises to polite applause and shakes Henry's hand.
text: As he settles behind the piano, he sits for a moment,
text: not moving, then nods to the two men behind him. As they
text: begin to play, we recognize the music from the record.
text: Jack waits, then brings his hands to the keys. As he
text: plays, his face is suddenly calm. Peaceful.
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
text: Later. Jack comes out of the club and into the night,
text: lighting a cigarette as he moves up the street.
speaker_heading: SUSIE (O.S.)
dialog: You were good.
text: Jack stops. Susie.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I can keep the beat.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Better than that.
text: Jack's face goes a little cold, but he says nothing,
text: beginning to walk again.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: What'd I say?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: You're upset.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not upset.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: All I said was you were good.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (stops)
dialog: Look. You don't know good. All right?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It means you wouldn't know good
dialog: if it came up and fucked you.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: You were good.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's make a deal. You shut up.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: You were good.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Because I saw the other people!
dialog: And they knew you were good!
dialog: You were good, goddamnit!
text: Jack studies Susie, then glances off. For a moment,
text: they just stand on the corner, not talking.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: So you wanna get a drink?
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nina?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Who's Nina?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Friend.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Friend? What's she look like?
dialog: Maybe I can help you find her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She's four feet tall. Ed?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Ed? How many people live here?
text: Eddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at
text: Susie. Jack moves to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I have to make him some chili.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (a look)
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Light from a weak lamp, lots of shadows, as romantic
text: as Jack's apartment will ever get. Outside the window,
text: the city looks like a thousand jewels, gleaming.
text: Susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly
text: about the room, slipping, in and out of the shadows as
dialog: if they were veils.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (at window)
dialog: Like diamonds, huh? I never get over it.
dialog: When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before
dialog: the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a
text: wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights
text: of the city and string them into-a necklace for
dialog: myself. She'd take my hand and when she closed her
dialog: eyes, I don't know, it was like she really
dialog: believed it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How come you didn't close your eyes?
text: She looks surprised by the question.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I don't know. I guess I didn't
dialog: trust the night like she did.
text: Susie finishes her drink and sets it down.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Let me have a cigarette, will you?
text: All of mine are down there on the sidewalk.
text: Jack looks at her curiously.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Long story.
text: Jack gives her an American cigarette and lights it.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know, I saw you guys once.
dialog: You and Frank. At the Roosevelt.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Must've been a cheap date.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Soap convention.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Soap?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At
dialog: least he was clean. Boy, the guys I met when I
dialog: was with the service, you wouldn't believe. The
dialog: older ones, they were okay. Nice. Polite. Pulled
dialog: the chair out for you. But the younger ones ...
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you
text: can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with
text: him again. She thought she had it all figured out.
dialog: But she wasn't so smart. There are killers with
text: palms like a baby.
text: Susie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It wasn't so bad, though. I'd get a nice piece of
dialog: steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift. Usually
dialog: whatever the guy was into. Got a socket set once.
dialog: Believe it? The guy looked like held just given me
text: four dozen roses.
dialog: (almost wistful)
dialog: But I stayed at the Hartford once. You should see
text: the rooms. All satin and velvet. And the bed.
text: Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow. Hard to
dialog: believe sleeping in a room like that don't change
dialog: your life. But it don't. The bed may be magic, but
text: the mirror isn't. You wake up the same old Susie.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I didn't always, you know. If I liked the guy ...
text: Susie looks at Jack, but he just takes a drink. She
text: looks out the window again.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Sometimes I wish the sun would never come up.
text: She stares at the lights another moment, then turns and
text: nods to the phone booth.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: So what's this?
text: Jack frowns, takes another drink.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: History.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My father proposed to my mother
dialog: in there.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: No kidding?
text: It's a small phone booth.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The both of them? In there?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He called her.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Oh. So what's it doing here?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Long story.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: You sending me home?
text: Jack locks eyes with Susie, then glances away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: They'd been out dancing all night and he took
dialog: her to the train station -- she lived over in
dialog: Brookhaven. Usually held ride with her, but this
text: time he didn't. Anyway, he starts walking home,
text: only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Nervous?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's
dialog: got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the
dialog: rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading
dialog: about it in the morning edition.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He had a mind that escalated things.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: So, what happened?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks
text: he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks
text: he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing
dialog: you know he's got his brothers down there and
text: they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
text: Susie blinks.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I don't know. Maybe he thought some rich guy was
dialog: gonna try and call her.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Wow. But I still don't see how ...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ma didn't want it around. After.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Oh.
text: Jack glances out the window.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing, carefully)
dialog: Frank said you saw him die.
text: Jack glances up quickly, surprised. He nods.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Frank said ---
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Frank wasn't 'there.
text: Susie stops, looks down. Jack studies her for a moment,
text: then decides.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He took me out to the docks one day. We did that a
dialog: lot. There were other places, but he loved the ocean.
dialog: He'd worked boats as a kid. Never got rid of it.
dialog: It was always in him. He'd drink a little when we'd
dialog: go. If he drank enough, he'd do this funny Irish jig.
dialog: To make me laugh.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He drank a lot that day.
text: Susie studies Jack as he stares into his glass.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: There was a lot of wind. He was up on this cargo
text: shelf, right over the ocean. And he started to
dialog: do the jig. One minute he was there ...
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I thought it was a joke at first.
dialog: He did things like that. Games.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I was laughing when it happened.
text: Jack stares at the glass in his hands, then glances
text: up and catches Susie looking at him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You got pretty eyes, you know that.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S BEDROOM
text: Jack's bed. In the darkness, we see Susie's profile,
text: her eyes looking up toward the ceiling. Jack's body
text: falls slowly across her and he kisses her neck.
scene_heading: EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
text: We see Eddie, wearing his Christmas sweater,
text: sleeping on the fire escape.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Susie is dressed, sitting at the piano, staring out the
text: window as she absently hits a key. She is smoking one
text: of Jack's cigarettes. Distracted. Jack comes to the
text: doorway and watches her. Plink. Plink. Plink.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You gotta move 'em around if you want to
text: play a song.
text: Susie starts, looks at her hand on the piano,
text: pulls it away.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Oh. Hi. Sorry.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Yeah... No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look, if you want to leave...
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
text: Susie throws the cigarette out the window,
text: then looks down.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Shit. I think I started a fire.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If our feet get hot, you grab
text: the piano.
text: Susie smiles weakly.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Why don't you go. I'll see you
text: tomorrow night at the Ambassador.
text: Susie doesn't move.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I followed you last night. I
dialog: mean, I was here. Outside. I was
dialog: about to come up when you came out.
text: Jack waits.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The reason I came by ... I couldn't tell Frank...
dialog: I'm leaving. The act.
text: Susie stares up at Jack, but he says nothing.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's a ... I met this guy at the resort. He liked
dialog: my voice. And, it's ... He thinks I can sell cat
dialog: food just by singing about it. Can you believe it?
text: Susie tries a laugh. Jack nods.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You can always get another girl.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (looks out window)
dialog: There's always another girl.
scene_heading: INT. LOUNGE
text: Jack and Frank stand in a lounge, talking to NICK, the
text: manager. Busboys move in and out, preparing the room
dialog: for the evening.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Sick? How sick?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The flu.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: So she's got a few sniffles.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Doctor's orders.
text: Nick frowns, looking at the two pianos across the room.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: You got no right springing this on me, Frankie.
dialog: It's unethical.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Look, Nick. You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What am I gonna do? Put a record
dialog: player out there?
dialog: (exiting)
dialog: Bad, Frankie. Bad.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Just until we find another girl.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Cancel, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You want to know how much I got tied up in
dialog: deposits with Willie? We're in for three
dialog: weeks solid, Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Better give her pneumonia.
scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM
text: Jack and Frank find themselves in the back room of
text: Willie's again. They do not look happy.
speaker_heading: GIRL (O.S.)
dialog: Remember me?
text: Jack and Frank look up. A girl in a yellow and black
text: dress is in the doorway. She looks like a bumblebee.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Monica. Monica Moran. I came in the last time
dialog: you guys were looking for a singer.
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Perseverance. First rule of show business.
text: Jack and Frank just stare at her.
speaker_heading: MONICA (GIRL)
dialog: I bought a book. That's what it says.
scene_heading: EXT. WILLIE'S - LATER
text: Frank is looking at a list.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We got the Roosevelt on Thursday, the Park in a
dialog: couple of weeks. Larry Shelton said he'd let me
dialog: know by Friday on the Ambassador. That's it.
text: Frank folds the paper carefully.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I got some calls out. Things
dialog: that might be good for us.
text: Frank looks over at Jack for the first time. He's
text: leaning against the building, staring at his shoes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We'll try for a girl again next
dialog: week.
text: Jack nods.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Okay. Well, the Roosevelt then.
scene_heading: INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - LOUNGE
text: Once grand, now dark and dusty looking. A small crowd.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know, my brother and I have been playing
dialog: together, gosh, I don't know. Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Twenty-eight years.
text: No response. Bored, brutally indifferent faces.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little
dialog: different. We were just kids. Just about the
dialog: only one who would listen to us was the family
dialog: cat, Cecil. We must've shaved three lives off old
dialog: Cecil, huh, Jack?
text: Frank laughs and his voice, eerily magnified by the
text: microphone, is the only sound in the room.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing; hanging tough)
dialog: Yeah, well, anyway. It's nice to be back here in
dialog: the Roosevelt Room, because this has always
dialog: been ...
text: Frank falters as he sees Mrs. Baker enter the lounge and
text: seat herself at a table in the back of the room.
text: Jack follows Frank's eyes and spots her.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: a very special place for Jack and I.
dialog: (recovering)
dialog: And tonight we'd like to open with a very special
dialog: song. It's the song my mother and father danced
text: to the night they were married. This is for them.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY
text: Jack watches as Frank gives Mrs. Baker a hug.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You should've told us you were coming, Ma.
dialog: We would've come and got you.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Spur of the moment.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So what'd you think?
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
text: Thrilling.
dialog: (glancing at Jack)
dialog: Both of you.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The audience was a little off
dialog: tonight.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
text: A few empty tables. It's cozier.
dialog: Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place
text: on a Wednesday night.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I guess you're,right. Well, what do you say we
dialog: get a little midnight snack?
dialog: Theo's should still be open.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: No, no. You boys are tired.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, we're not. Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: I'm tired. Really. I should get
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You sure?
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Just call me a cab.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A cab? Ma, come on. My car's just a half
dialog: block down. You wait here.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: All right.
text: Frank dashes out of the lobby. Jack and Mrs. Baker
text: watch him go, then turn to each other. Mrs. Baker smiles
text: awkwardly, then surveys the lobby.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's beautiful, isn't it?
text: The brocade on the walls has faded and the chairs -
text: once covered with velvet, now with a cheap imitation -
text: look old and dowdy, but the room still maintains an
text: elegant dignity.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: This was quite,a place once. After the war. On
dialog: Friday nights they had dances in the ballroom
text: upstairs. It was beautiful. Crystal chandeliers.
text: White tablecloths. Orchids floating in the punch
dialog: bowls... It was a wonderful place to be young.
text: Jack watches his mother as her eyes pass over the room.
text: After a moment, she nods toward the lounge.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It went well tonight.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Frank works hard.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: And you don't?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He leads, I follow.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Is that the way it is?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pretty much.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: He mentioned you had a girl for
text: a while. A singer.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: For a while. She left.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Yes, well, it's probably best.
dialog: No sense bringing someone else in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I suppose.
text: Mrs. Baker glances into the lounge, at the two pianos.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Funny. Watching tonight, I was
dialog: remembering when you were young.
dialog: How I used to stand in the kitchen, listening to
dialog: the two of you practice while I did the dishes.
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: My two little radios. Sometimes I'd stop and go to
dialog: the door and just watch. Sometimes your father
dialog: would too.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He liked to listen to you play.
dialog: Did you know that?
text: Jack shakes his head.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You miss him, don't you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's been a long time, Ma.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
text: Jack nods. Mrs. Baker smiles, then it fades.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: His love scared me, you know. The day he died he
text: left a flower on my pillow.
text: Jack looks puzzled. Suddenly his mother reaches out
text: and very gently touches her fingers to his face.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You look so like him.
text: They stand like this for a moment, connnected, then
text: Frank steps in from the street.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Your limo's ready, Ma.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: All right.
text: Mrs. Baker takes her hand from Jack's face and turns
text: away. Just before she exits, she looks back.
scene_heading: MRS. BAKER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Good night, Jack.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Jack, walking home, turns a corner and suddenly stops.
text: Across the street, talking to a man, is Susie. She says
text: a few words to the man, then touches him lightly on the
text: arm and begins to walk away. Jack watches her retreat,
text: then follows, moving quicker as he draws close. As he
text: reaches her, he gently touches her elbow and she turns.
text: Not Susie. The woman stares at Jack, startled.
text: For a moment, he doesn't move. Finally, he lets go of
text: her elbow.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sorry.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: A few nights later. Frank guides the car through wet
text: city streets. It's two AM and raining hard.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're not getting paid then.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nothing. We get nothing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I told you, Jack. It's a telethon.
dialog: No one gets a cent.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: What's it for?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know. Some disease.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What disease?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You don't know?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's a disease, Jack. We're against it.
dialog: It's not a moral decision.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (another pause)
dialog: What channels it on?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Seventy-one
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Seventy-one? What's seventy-one?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: A channel.
text: It's just a little further down the dial, that's all.
dialog: Look, it's publicity. Publicity's publicity. Right?
text: Jack stares at Frank.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Jack and Frank make their way down a hallway.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The guy said to find Studio E and
dialog: turn right. What's that say?
text: Suddenly, a rapid-fire THUMPING SOUND resounds through
text: the corridor. As Jack and Frank turn, they see a huge
text: YOUTH in a wheelchair dribbling a basketball toward them.
speaker_heading: YOUTH
dialog: Fast break!
text: Jack and Frank step back and watch the kid one-wheel it
text: around the corner.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I guess it's that way.
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO
dialog: Jerry Lewis need not fear. This is strictly a tin foil
text: and crepe paper operation. Along one wall is the "phone
text: bank," monitored by a few sleepy volunteers, and opposite,
text: in makeshift bleachers, is the audience. A huge tote board,
text: set on rolling astors, is next to the phones. The total,
text: at 2:15 AM, is $1125.38. As Jack and Frank enter, the kid
text: in the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the
text: camera.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This must be it. I'll see when
dialog: we're on.
text: Frank leaves. Jack glances around the studio like he's
text: walked into a nightmare. At the phone bank, a heavyset
text: MAN in a sweatshirt and a cap, looks over. Both the
text: sweatshirt and the cap have "Earl" printed on them.
speaker_heading: EARL (MAN)
dialog: You the magician?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh. What do you do?
text: Jack points to the pianos across the room.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Piano.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (hopeful)
dialog: Two at a time?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My brother and I. One each.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (disappointed again)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (indicating the kid in the wheelchair)
dialog: What's wrong with the kid?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Knee. Tore it up against St. Anthony's. Right
dialog: before the accident.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Accident?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: The fire. The way we're going we'll be lucky to
text: buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
text: As Jack registers this, Earl's PHONE RINGS. Frank
text: returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: We're on after Meadowlark.
dialog: (seeing Jack's face)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are you kidding me? Are you
dialog: fucking kidding me?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We're playing for a goddamn
dialog: gymnasium!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (worried)
dialog: What?
text: Before Jack can further enlighten Frank, the kid in the
text: wheelchair rolls off and a guy in a cheap rented tux
text: strides in front of the camera. He's VINCE NANCY,
dialog: the host.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Let's hear it for our own Jimmy
dialog: Marshall, shall we?
text: The audience applauds.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: As most of you'know, young Jimmy put a nasty twist
dialog: on that knee trying to win-one for good ol' Grant
dialog: High this year. Luckily, the doctors tell us
dialog: Jimmy'll be able to play next season. That is ...
dialog: if there is a next season.
dialog: (Uncle Sam)
dialog: That's where you come in. Pick up that phone.
dialog: Make a donation. Let's keep our kids off the
text: streets and in the gym where they belong.
dialog: Applause.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: All right. Well, friends, what can I say about
dialog: our next guest?
dialog: (consulting a card)
dialog: He, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with
dialog: us two of the most respected men in the musical
dialog: entertainment field. I think you'll agree with me
dialog: when I tell you we're in for a real treat when I
dialog: say that we have with us ... the Fabulous Bunker
dialog: Boys! Come on out here guys.
text: Vince gestures grandly to the left and Jack and
text: Frank enter from the right.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Whoops, there they are. Hey, nice
text: suits, fellas.
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: Now I know a lot of you amateur musicians out
dialog: there are going to want to rap with these guys and
dialog: don't worry. Right after they finish up here,
dialog: they're going to be manning the phones. Maybe we
text: can even convince them to raffle off a few piano
dialog: lessons if we're lucky. What do you think?
text: The audience applauds. Jack glares at Frank. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Well, all right then. What are we
dialog: waiting for? Take it away, guys.
text: Jack and Frank poise their hands over their pianos and
text: begin to play. As the music rises, the studio becomes
text: very quiet, almost still. Unfortunately, Jack and Frank
text: are barely through the opening passage when a thunderously
text: LOUD BELL begins to RING. Suddenly, Vince steps out
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Uh oh. We know what that means, don't we? It's
dialog: time to turn the board over.
dialog: (to Jack, Frank)
dialog: I'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute.
dialog: Let's bring out the board.
text: Two post-pubescent giants roll out the tote board
text: right in front of Jack and Frank.
text: Jack looks positively homicidal.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jack ...
text: Jack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave.
text: Then, seeing the kid in the wheelchair, he grabs the
text: basketball and fires it at Vince.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: What the --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: You're a fucking creep, you know
dialog: that. I oughta kick your ass.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Jack, you're on television.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shut up, Frank.
text: Earl of the sweatshirt and cap puts his hand on
text: Jack's shoulder.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: What do you say we go for a walk,
dialog: pal.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get your hand off me.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Come on, friend. I can smell it on you.
dialog: Get yourself a cup of coffee. You'll forget
dialog: what you're angry about.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Go fuck yourself.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (eyes go hard)
dialog: You're a real tough guy when the
dialog: ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't see any ladies here.
dialog: Except maybe you.
text: That does it. Earl takes hold of Jack's collar and
text: starts to-wrestle him roughly toward the door.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, leave him alone.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Do your brother a favor and have his mouth sewn up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're a lousy dancer, Earl. Don't
dialog: you know the man's supposed to lead?
text: Earl shoves Jack into the hallway, hard.
text: Jack stumbles back against the wall.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Who do you think you are, asshole?
dialog: Liberace?
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Jack walks down the street, mindless of the rain.
text: Frank follows a few yards behind.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Jack. We just,passed the car. Jack. This is a
text: tuxedo. Three hundred dollars.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You gonna talk to me? Or is this Jack's famous
dialog: silent act? Look, it was for publicity.
dialog: Do you understand? Publicity.
text: Jack stops and stares at Frank incredulously.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What-are you? A fucking moron?
text: It's three o'clock in the morning,
dialog: Frank. Who's watching? Your wife?
dialog: Maybe you can get us a gig playing
text: Little Frank's birthday party.
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Look. I didn't know when we were going to be on
dialog: until yesterday. What was I supposed to do?
dialog: I had the pianos anyway.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Basketballs, Frank. You had us
text: playing for basketballs.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm sorry. I should've checked it out. I screwed
dialog: up. But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle
dialog: of a gig.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It wasn't professional, Jack. It was a stunt.
dialog: A stupid-ass stunt.
text: Jack just stares at Frank, as if looking at a stranger.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's happening to you, Frank? You been kissing
dialog: ass so long you're starting to like it? You let
dialog: that guy turn us into clowns tonight. We were
dialog: always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank.
dialog: What's happened to your dignity?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Dignity? Who the hell are you to
dialog: talk about dignity?
text: Frank suddenly steps forward and reaches into Jack's
text: jacket, coming away with a bottle.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: This where you get your dignity, Jack?
dialog: This is where you get your courage?
text: Jack tries to grab the bottle but Frank holds it away.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: No, let's do it straight for
dialog: once, shall we?
text: Frank tosses the BOTTLE into the street, where it
text: SHATTERS.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Let me explain something to you, little brother.
dialog: See, I've got people who depend on me. I've got
text: a wife and two children who expect to wake up every
text: morning with food on the table and heat in the house.
dialog: I got a mortgage. I got car payments. I got Ma's
dialog: medical bills. Oh yeah, and I got you. Yeah, you.
dialog: Jack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so
dialog: fucking sure he's better than everyone else. Don't
dialog: you think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes
dialog: and blow smoke in his face? Goddamn right I would.
dialog: But I can't. Because I have to be responsible, little
dialog: brother. I have to make sure the numbers balance out
dialog: in my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go
dialog: on living their lives. You don't win medals for it,
dialog: but you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I
dialog: folded up shop. So don't talk to me about dignity,
dialog: little brother. You're drawing on a weak hand.
text: Jack stares at Frank through the rain,
text: then turns and begins to walk away.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Great. Terrific. Walk away. You're good at that,
dialog: Jack. Just don't forget to stop off for another
dialog: bottle of courage on your way home.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That's what he'd do.
text: Jack stops, his back to Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You've found the perfect solution to all the
dialog: pain in the world, haven't you, little brother?
dialog: Eight-fifty a bottle, available any time day or
dialog: night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store.
dialog: You're weak, Jack. Just like he was.
text: Jack turns, tough and dangerous in the darkness.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stay off it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, let's stay on it. I'm sick and tired of
dialog: watching you make him up into some kinda god.
dialog: For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid
dialog: bullshit jig. He left a wife and two sons. He
dialog: wasn't a hero. He was a fool.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (eerily cold)
dialog: You weren't there.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's right. I wasn't there. I don't have the
dialog: luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (coiled)
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, fuck you. And fuck him too.
dialog: Fuck the both-of you.
text: Jack suddenly bolts for,ward and grabs Frank by the
text: lapels.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, what're you doing? Hey!
text: Jack flings Frank against the wall, pounding, pulling
text: and slamming him in a fitful rage.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing; scared)
dialog: Jack! ... Jack! ...
text: Frank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect
text: himself. Jack hovers over him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How's it feel to have your little brother beat
dialog: the shit out of you? Huh? Huh!
text: Jack comes down with a vicious fist at Frank's face.
text: Frank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself,
text: and catches a blow on his fingers.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: My hands! My hands!
text: Jack grabs one of Frank's hands.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: Your hands. Your hands couldn't take the blue
text: ribbon on amateur night.
text: Jack bends back Frank's fingers.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: Jack!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who's weak now, big brother?
text: Jack pushes Frank's fingers until the knuckles crack.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jack! JACK!
text: Frank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain.
text: Suddenly Jack stops. Looking at Frank's hand, still
text: clasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior
text: as Frank. Letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks
text: at his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped
text: and dirty. He stares at his own hands, the knuckles split
text: and bleeding. He no longer looks dangerous. He looks
text: hollow, frightened.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm through with it. I can't do
dialog: it anymore.
text: Frank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at Jack, but Jack
text: just turns away, leaving Frank on the sidewalk, and
text: disappears into the rain. MUSIC begins. A sad, plaintive
text: solo piano. And we see:
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: Jack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain
text: over now.
text: Frank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the
text: dim glow of the streetlights.
text: Jack, letting himself into his apartment and standing
text: there. Alone.
text: Frank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off
dialog: the engine.
text: Jack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly.
text: Frank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as
text: the sun begins to come up.
text: Jack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: The next morning. Jack is sitting on the windowsill,
text: watching the RAIN DRUM the GLASS. He glances at the phone
text: across the room, takes another look at the rain, then goes
text: to the phone. He picks it up hesitantly, then dials.
text: It rings. Again. Again.
speaker_heading: CINDY (V.0.)
dialog: Hello?
text: Jack blinks. It's Cindy.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hello ... Hellooooo ...
dialog: (fainter)
dialog: Daddy. Daddy! Someone's on the
dialog: phone and they won't talk.
text: Jack sets the phone back down on the cradle.
scene_heading: INT. BAR
text: Jack stands in a dark bar. It is early morning and the
text: light from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere.
text: A big, beefy MAN with a bar towel hooked in his belt is
text: talking to Jack.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: If they wanna talk about their wife, you listen.
dialog: If they wanna talk about their job, you listen.
dialog: If they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen.
dialog: That's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until I
dialog: send you home. Okay?
text: Jack nods and points to the piano in the corner.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That it?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: How many you need?
text: Jack walks over to the giano and strikes a note.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: It's out of tune.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Trust me, the way I fix a martini,
dialog: it'll be in tune.
text: The MUSIC RETURNS, sad and plaintive, and we see:
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE
text: Frank, attempting to give piano lessons to a brother
dialog: and sister tandem who would be better served by an
text: obedience school. While the little girl pounds
text: incessantly on the piano, her brother runs circles
text: around the room, destroying everything in sight.
text: MUSIC CONTINUES and we see:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Jack and Eddie, going for a walk, passing the diner
text: where Jack and Frank's pictures are still displayed.
text: MUSIC CONTINUES and we see:
scene_heading: INT. BAR
text: Jack, in the bar, playing the music we've been hearing
text: throughout the previous scenes. It is after midnight
text: and the tables are empty. Only a few somber men remain
text: at the bar. They do not appear to be music lovers.
text: As Jack finishes, he takes a cloth and wipes the keys.
text: There is a glass on the piano with money in it.
speaker_heading: SUSIE (O.S.)
dialog: I thought the Bakers didn't take
dialog: tips.
text: Jack glances up, but he knows the voice.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I give it all to charity.
text: Susie nods.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Saw the sign outside. Got your
dialog: own sign, huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. Got my own sign.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: So ... ?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We outgrew each other.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't
dialog: figure. You two.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You don't pick your brother.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So how's the cat food business?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Terrific. I'm doing vegetables next week.
text: Jack nods.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What kind?
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Vegetables.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Oh. Carrots. And peas. None of
dialog: the important ones.
text: Susie tries a smile. Takes a breath.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Listen... you want to get a drink? I got a new
dialog: place. Or we could go to a bar ...
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Well, maybe not a bar. But I know
dialog: a place uptown, if you want --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've given it up.
text: Susie stops.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: No kidding? Well ... I guess you can't do a
dialog: reunion over tomato juice, can you?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Anyway, if you're ever in the
dialog: neighborhood ... I wrote it down.
text: Susie takes a slip of paper from her purse and hands
text: it to Jack. They lock eyes for a moment.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Tell egghead I said hi. If you
dialog: see him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If I see him.
text: Susie nods and walks toward the door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey.
dialog: (as she stops)
dialog: You got pretty eyes.
text: Susie smiles. As she leaves, Jack studies the slip
text: of paper in his hand, then drops it in the tip glass.
text: He glances at the door, swinging slowly shut in Susie's
text: wake, then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S DEN
text: Frank sits alone in the darkness of the den. The
text: cardboard stand-up is there, along with several old
text: photographs, including one showing two skinny kids in
text: tuxes standing with a glamorous Peggy Lee. After a moment,
text: Donna enters.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Frank? It's late, honey.
text: Frank stays staring at the photograph of Peggy Lee.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (continuing)
text: Mrs. Lerner called after dinner. Robbie can't make
dialog: his lesson tomorrow.
text: Donna waits for her husband to say something, then sees the
text: photograph in his hand.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know how good he is? It's like breathing
dialog: with him. I've always envied it. But tonight,
text: looking at all this -- at his face -- I don't know.
text: Maybe it's worse. For him.
dialog: (gesturing to the piano)
dialog: It's funny. When I sit here and play ... nothing.
dialog: But when I was up there with him...
dialog: It was like I had the gift, too.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NEXT DAY
text: Frank is standing in the hallway of his house, leaning
text: against the bathroom door. It's locked.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on, Jeremy. Open the door.
text: Somewhere in the house, the PHONE RINGS.
text: Frank ignores it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Jeremy. You want me to call your father?
text: He's not going to be very happy when he hears
dialog: he's spending fifteen dollars an hour for you
text: to sit on the toilet.
text: Donna, looking shaken, steps into the hallway.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Honey ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You believe this? The kid won't come out. I'm
text: playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next
text: thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom.
dialog: There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Honey ...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where are our kids?
dialog: Has he got one of them in there?
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: Frank.
text: Frank finally looks at his wife. She's crying.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Jack rushes down a hospital corridor and heads for the
text: nurses station. As he moves to the counter, Donna
text: appears.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Donna. Where is she?
text: Donna just shakes her head.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: We tried the apartment, but after
dialog: that we didn't know where to call.
text: Jack looks frozen.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Frank'll be back in a moment.
text: He took Little Frank to the bathroom.
text: Jack begins to back away slowly.
speaker_heading: DONNA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Jack ...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Jack moves aimlessly down the street, slipping in
text: and out of shadows. Finally he stops inside a closed
text: storefront, his back up against the window, and looks
text: down at his hands. They're shaking.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY
text: Jack stands in an apartment hallway, waiting.
text: After a moment, the door opens. It's Susie.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Well, this is some surprise.
dialog: (seeing his face)
dialog: Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
text: Susie studies Jack as he glances around the hallway.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Jack?
text: Jack looks up.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You want to come in?
text: He nods. Susie steps back and Jack enters.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Let me get the light.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
text: He stares directly into her eyes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Leave it dark.
scene_heading: INT. SUSIE'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING
text: Jack is standing at the foot of the bed, looking down
text: at Susie's naked back as she sleeps. He studies her
text: face as if looking for something, then takes his coat
text: and begins to leave.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I used to do that.
text: Jack turns. Susie is looking at him.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
text: Sneak out in the morning. Before the guy could
dialog: wake up and ruin it. Never figured I'd be on
text: the other end of it, though.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I didn't want to wake you.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (smiling slightly)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thanks. For letting me in last night.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Funny how life repeats itself, huh? Over and over.
text: Like a song.
text: Jack looks at Susie for a long moment, then nods and
text: turns for the door.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey.
text: Jack stops, his hand on the doorknob.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Am I gonna see you again?
text: Jack looks at her face, beautiful in the morning light.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. You're gonna see me again.
text: Susie smiles slightly.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Jack is standing across the street from his mother's
text: house, just looking. After a moment, he crosses the
text: street. As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of
text: the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it,
text: kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there --
text: cat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the
text: damage smoothed and widened by time. He runs his
text: fingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks
text: toward the house.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE
text: Through the screen door, Jack can hear a CLICKING
text: sound and see partially into the front door. Half
text: the room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light.
text: He opens the door and enters.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE
text: Inside, the movie PROJECTOR is RUNNING, the tail of a
text: completed FLIP SLAPPING like a whip against the carriage.
text: Jack TURNS OFF the PROJECTOR and the room falls entirely
text: into shadow. For a moment, the house is silent, full of
text: ghosts, then, gradually, a NOISE is heard coming from the
dialog: kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: As Jack comes into the kitchen, he finds Frank searching
text: through a cabinet. He watches for a moment.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What're you looking for?
text: Frank turns quickly, surprised.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I didn't hear you come in.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What're you doing?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink. But
text: it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of
text: cooking sherry.
text: Jack nods. Frank looks nervous.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Uh, we already boxed some things. I figured you'd
dialog: want to go through Dad's stuff. It's in there.
dialog: If you want to get started.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Later.
text: Frank nods. Silence.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Is everything done? The arrangements, I mean.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh. Yeah. It was all worked out before, you know.
dialog: She and Dad had taken care of it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I set it for Wednesday. The ceremony. They're
dialog: doing the stone today.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It's okay? Wednesday?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, fine.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's not going to be a viewing.
dialog: I figured with the kids and all ...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sure.
text: Jack glances around the room. Pictures on the walls.
text: Handmade curtains, lightly faded.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's funny. Before, whenever I came here, the
dialog: house seemed small. But today ... I can't keep
text: up with it. I keep losing my wind.
text: Frank smiles slightly and he and Jack lock eyes for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing;glancing away)
dialog: God, I could use a drink.
text: Jack hesitates, then pulls a bottle out of his coat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh. Well, great. I'll get a couple glasses.
text: Frank moves to a cabinet, but there's nothing there.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Damn. Donna must've packed
dialog: them up this morning.
text: Jack holds out the bottle.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (showing the seal is unbroken)
dialog: Bought it on the way over. Clean
dialog: as a nun.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, it's not that. I ... can't
text: drink from the bottle. I ... gag.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, yeah, right. I forgot.
text: Frank looks embarrassed.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: Oh, hey, I want to show you
dialog: something. Come on.
text: Jack follows Frank back into the front room. Frank
text: stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and
text: gestures Jack to the other.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hit the C. Go ahead.
text: Jack steps over to the other piano and taps, then Frank
text: does the same. Jack glances up in surprise.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm right, aren't I? They're
dialog: in tune.
text: Jack hits the note again and nods in amazement.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: All these years. She kept them in tune.
dialog: Can you imagine?
dialog: Now why would she do something like that?
text: Frank looks down at the keys and his smile fades.
text: Suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot
text: glasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a
dialog: different hotel.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Hey, what do you know. Looks like we can have
dialog: that drink after all.
dialog: (picking up a few glasses)
dialog: What's your pleasure? We got the downtown Ramada.
dialog: We got the Travelodge on Route 41.
dialog: And ... the Mallory.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll take the Mallory.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good choice.
text: Frank blows some dust off the glasses.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Looks like these got a few years on them.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This'll kill 'em.
text: Jack pours and he and Frank settle on the tiny piano
text: benches. As Frank swallows, he winces.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesus.
text: It suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old
text: familiar place, staring into his glass.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How're your hands?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Oh. Fine. It was nothing. Couple
text: sore knuckles. Nothing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know, that night, I ... It
dialog: just all came up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, I know. Me, too.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I mean, you can play. You're
dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I can keep the beat.
text: Jack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Charlie called.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah. Larry Shelton. Blackie. Couple others.
dialog: Donna said even Lloyd called the other day.
dialog: Nothing like a little absence to make the heart
dialog: grow fonder, huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
text: Jack and Frank lock eyes again.
text: Frank's glance drops to Jack's glass.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Five years ago.
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: November.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Right. It was someone's birthday.
dialog: Halloran?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Daughter's. Sweet sixteen.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Christ, that's right. How could
dialog: I forget. What a nightmare.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She asked for it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I told Halloran we didn't do
dialog: vocals, but he said:
speaker_heading: JACK AND FRANK
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: What my Sissy-wants, my Sissy gets.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She got it all right.
text: Jack and Frank glance at one another, little boy
text: mischief glowing in their faces. Suddenly they swivel
text: on the pianos and begin to play "You're Sixteen."
speaker_heading: JACK AND FRANK
dialog: (singing)
text: She comes on like a dream
dialog: Peaches and cream
text: Lips like strawberry wine
dialog: She's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine.
dialog: Ribbons and curls
dialog: Ooh, what a girl
text: Eyes that sparkle and shine
dialog: You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.
text: As Jack and Frank finish, they're laughing. After a
text: moment, their voices die and the house is quiet again.
text: Full of ghosts. Each stares at the tiny keyboard before
text: him, awkward with the intimacy of the moment. It is
text: quiet for a very long time. Finally, Frank looks over.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well ... One more time?
text: Jack glances up and sees Frank has his empty glass
text: held out. He hesitates, then picks up the bottle.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: One more time.
dialog:
