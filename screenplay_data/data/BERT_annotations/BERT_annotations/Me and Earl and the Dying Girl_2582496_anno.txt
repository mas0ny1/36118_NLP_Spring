speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: Never commit to an interaction that

speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: One last thing. Hot girls destroy

dialog: doesn’t matter if the hot girl is

dialog: that is the Schenley cafeteria.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So where do you usually sit?
text: ROBO-GREG'S POV: Greg's system is going haywire. His field of

text: The giant red words “SYSTEM FAILURE” are flashing over

text: that a computer is about to explode.
scene_heading: BACK TO THE THIRD-PERSON:
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: It’s literally like we’re trying to

dialog: Knight with a “K.”
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Medieval prom-m-m-m!
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Isn't prom like six months away?
text: They turn their gaze to Greg. Who is this schmuck who’s gonna
dialog: talk trash on medieval prom?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hi guys. Greg’s sitting with us
dialog: today. Anyone need ketchup? No?
text: Rachel goes to get ketchup, leaving Greg to fend for himself.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: (fake-nice)
dialog: So Greg, why are you sitting with
dialog: us today?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Uh... you know. Lunch. Gotta sit
dialog: somewhere. You can’t stand and eat.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You and Rachel seem very...
text: friendly all of a sudden.
text: Naomi is patiently, cleverly devising some sort of rhetorical
text: trap. Anna does not share this patience or cleverness.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Yeah. You’re only hanging out with
dialog: Rachel because she has cancer.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Greg, you’ve never hung out with
dialog: Rachel once. You’re befriending her
dialog: to feel good about yourself. It’s
dialog: okay. You can admit it.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: No! I’m not! Who even does that?
text: Enter MADISON HARTNER. She touches Greg’s arm.
scene_heading: A MOOSE STOMPS A CHIPMUNK
dialog: Blue (6/3/14) 33.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Hi guys. Can I sit with you?
text: Anna and Naomi gaze at her with coolness, if not hostility.
text: But RACHEL has re-arrived with her ketchup, so they can’t be
dialog: mean to her outright.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Of course.
text: Greg is relieved that someone else has shown up who is more
text: of an irritating do-gooder than him.
text: Madison puts a PILLOW on the table.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Sorry, I have to carry this pillow
dialog: around and pretend it’s a baby. For
dialog: health class. This is a safe place
dialog: to put it, right?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: A pillow? Greg, what do you think?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (trying to play along)
dialog: Yeah, you better not put it too
dialog: close to me, because I might, uh,
text: just masturbate all over it.
text: No one understands this inside joke except Greg and Rachel.
text: A horrified silence settles over the table.
speaker_heading: ANNA
text: GREG, THAT’S WEIRD AND GROSS.
text: Greg panics. He needs to change the subject. He sees SCOTT
text: MAYHEW loping clumsily around, his TRENCH COAT flapping.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Um! Everyone! Check out Scott
text: Mayhew’s tyrannosaurus walk. Great
dialog: way to get from point A to point B.
dialog: I think we should all try it.
text: Success! Rachel giggles. Emboldened, Greg continues.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
text: Also love the trench coat indoors.

speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: And will someone please tell me
dialog: what is up with this guy’s hair! It

dialog: No one laughs. Oh Jesus.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Greg, that’s really mean.
speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: MR. MCCARTHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Boys, behold wisdom’s very source.

speaker_heading: MR. MCCARTHY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s Vietnamese. They call it pho.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Lemme try some one time.
speaker_heading: MR. MCCARTHY
dialog: (closing pot)
dialog: Can't give you food. Totally

speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Ain’t goin to no Lawrenceville.
speaker_heading: MR. MCCARTHY
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Greg. How you holding up, bud?
text: This is clearly a question about Rachel. Greg does not know
text: how to fight the implication that he and Rachel have a thing.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Holding up? Good. But not great.
dialog: But I mean, stuff in general, ups
dialog: and downs, take it as it comes.
dialog: Life has many facets. So... amen.
speaker_heading: MR. MCCARTHY
dialog: Amen. You owe me multiple essays.
dialog: And that is a fact. Gentlemen!
speaker_heading: GREG AND EARL
dialog: Respect the research.
text: Mr. McCarthy beams, thumps his own abs, and leaves. Greg and

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: People just assume Rachel and I are

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Today I threatened to sexually

dialog: Both of those are Rachel’s fault.
dialog: I’m sorry. They just are.
dialog: Earl stares at Greg, like, Greg. Don’t be a dick.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: (rebelliously)
dialog: But somehow I’m the dick for
dialog: complaining about it.
text: Earl doubles down on his disgusted stare.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: OF HIM.

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: EARL

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: EARL

text: Denise opens the door, swaying a little -
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: It’s my humble little mouse! And

speaker_heading: GREG

dialog: and not really doing anything, and
text: Rachel’s about to lose all her

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Uhhhhh.

speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Buhhhhhh.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (beginning to sound
dialog: tearful)
dialog: You guys can go if you want.

dialog: Blue (6/3/14) 42.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: We're accidentally on drugs.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Accidentally?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: McCarthy gave us some of his soup--
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (hastily)
dialog: Mr. McCarthy gave us some of his
dialog: totally normal soup. But it was,
dialog: uh, the last of the soup. So we had
dialog: to go get more. From a restaurant.
text: On the fifth floor of an office
text: building. And in the same building
dialog: there was a Jamaican embassy.
dialog: No one knows where this is going.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: We got trapped in an elevator with
dialog: a Rastafarian. He just hotboxed the

speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Yeah. That’s what happened.
dialog: But thank God: Rachel thinks that these confused, lying boys

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You guys had quite an adventure.
speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So you know Greg from class?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: I known Greg ever since we was
dialog: little. You know I was in y’all’s
dialog: kindergarten, right?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Yeah. I remember you. You were the

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh my God! Yes!
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Dude came running up to you. Showed

dialog: Said, “Justin. Only perverts show
dialog: their butts.” I was right there.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It’s amazing you remember that.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: You was a hero. Shut his perverted
dialog: ass right down. Never forget it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: So you and Greg are coworkers?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Naw, we friends. He just hates

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yeah! He does! What’s going on?
speaker_heading: EARL

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)

dialog: who's close to him. Dude’s weird-
dialog: ass dad don’t socialize with nobody
dialog: cept the cat. So that’s a role
dialog: model ain’t got no friends.
dialog: Bottom line, dude’s terrified to
dialog: call anybody his friend. Because
dialog: they might say, hold up, bro. I
dialog: ain’t your friend. And then he’d
dialog: have to kill himself.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Wow.

text: Also the beautiful harp music is playing.
scene_heading: BACK TO THIRD-PERSON:

speaker_heading: EARL

speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: So we're pretty far into this
dialog: stupid story now, and you're
dialog: probably saying to yourself, “Hey.
dialog: I like this girl Rachel, and I’m
dialog: gonna be pissed if she dies at the
dialog: end.” So I’m just telling you:
dialog: Don’t freak out. She survives. When

dialog: to some colleges. She says it’s
dialog: like a menu for my future. Sure. A

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You have to be less of an idiot

speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: (Werner Herzog voice)
dialog: The highly selective admissions
dialog: process of college weeds out the
dialog: cruel and the stupid. And so a
dialog: college is quite different from the

dialog: So again, if this was a touching
dialog: romantic story, we'd obviously fall
dialog: in love, and she’d say all the wise
dialog: beautiful things that can only be
dialog: learned in life’s twilight or
dialog: whatever, and then she’d die in my
dialog: arms. But again: that’s not what

dialog: Greg finally can’t be quiet anymore--
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey. How are you feeling, for real.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: For real? I’m feeling like you
dialog: might have been right.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Right when?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Back in October. When you thought I
dialog: was dying.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (gutted/trying to recover)
dialog: Oh. Well. I regret thinking that.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don’t regret it.

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Regretful Polar Bear.
text: Against her will, Rachel snort-laughs a little bit.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Polar bears have the purest

text: plaintive they sound. Urrrrnnrnngh.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don’t make me laugh, though. It

speaker_heading: GREG

text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Kind of a monster silence in here.
speaker_heading: Blue (6/3/14) 69A.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yeah. It’s okay to just be silent
dialog: for a while.
text: Greg finds it difficult to be silent. He fidgets and squirms.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Are you going?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You should go.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: No way. Have you seen me in a tux?

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: My movie? You know I’m not working
text: on a movie.

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: He... yes, I guess he probably did.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Sorry. I’m just asking because--
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Goddamn Earl. It was supposed to be
dialog: a surprise for you. It’s just taken
dialog: forever, because we really want to
dialog: get it right--
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I think I’m probably gonna stop
dialog: treatment pretty soon.
text: It is very quiet in the room for a moment.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: If you can’t accept that I’m going

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I’m a terrible friend? I’m not
dialog: giving up. I’m not ruining my
dialog: friend’s life by giving up on the
dialog: whole world.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Please. Greg, you should be
dialog: overjoyed. Now you can go back to
dialog: your life of being invisible and

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah and you can go back to your
dialog: life of being dead.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Nice. Really nice.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: This is gonna kill your mom. So

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: How can you--how can you even say
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Your mom forced you to hang out

dialog: The shit is that.
speaker_heading: GREG

dialog: Liked his sons to wear ties.
dialog: And then at the wake, all his old
dialog: buddies are there telling me about
text: him, and it’s like they’re talking
dialog: about a complete other guy. Like,
dialog: he knew every European pop song
dialog: from the 70s, from when he was
dialog: stationed in Germany. He’d just sit
text: around memorizing songs to sing at
dialog: German girls in bars. His go-to was
dialog: this Dutch song called Ding-A-Dong.
dialog: That's a real song. And he sang it
text: at German girls in bars.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So what does that mean.
speaker_heading: MR. MCCARTHY
dialog: It just means that, even if someone
dialog: dies, you're still gonna keep
dialog: learning about them. You know?
dialog: Their life keeps unfolding to you,
dialog: if you keep paying attention to it.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (sullenly)

speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Hi Rachel. We tried a bunch of
dialog: different ways of making a film for

dialog: goofy, and irrelevant, and not like
dialog: we wanted. So now I’m just gonna
dialog: talk to you directly.
dialog: (collects himself)
dialog: I'ma be honest here. Sometimes
dialog: white girls are a particular kind
dialog: of stupid. I mean errbody stupid
dialog: but you know. White girls think
dialog: they smarter than errbody. Self-
dialog: centered and pretendin like they
dialog: ain’t - well, obviously you ain’t
dialog: been like that.
dialog: (collects himself again)
dialog: It’s just crazy how patient you
dialog: been. That’s all I wanted to say.

dialog: Hi Rachel. Uh... Earl’s right. All
dialog: the ways we tried to make a film
dialog: for you turned out completely
dialog: horrible. So, yeah. It got me
dialog: thinking about the reason I wanted
dialog: to do this film.
dialog: He pauses. The fact is, he never wanted to do this film.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: And that reason is, when you come
dialog: right down to it, and just say it,
dialog: simply, without screwing around:
text: He has to say something.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh... I believe in you.
text: He is quoting the first video testimonial, from that stupid
text: kid. He’s not even saying his own meaningless clichéd thing.
dialog: It’s something else's.

text: down, at his hands.

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Don’t worry, mom. I’m sure you can

dialog: after Rachel dies. Which, by the
dialog: way, she’s decided to do. She's

speaker_heading: GREG

text: His mom, horrified, says nothing.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: But for right now, do me a favor.
dialog: And just leave me alone. I just
dialog: want to sit here and regret stuff.
dialog: I’m gonna think of everything I’ve
dialog: ever done, and everything I haven’t
dialog: done, and just regret the living

speaker_heading: GREG'S MOM (0.S.)
dialog: (tearfully)
dialog: The deadlines have passed, Victor!
dialog: What’s he going to do next year? Is

speaker_heading: GREG'S DAD (0.S.)
dialog: He is grieving, honey. You have to

speaker_heading: GREG'S MOM (0.S.)

text: And again, Madison comes to sit with him.
dialog: Super: The part where I get in my second fight ever
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: Greg? Can I ask you something?
text: Greg gathers his things and gets up.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: It’s not what you think--
dialog: ALT: It’s not what you think. It’s
dialog: about prom--
text: Madison touches his arm, but he shrugs it off, angrily--
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Let me ask you something--what is
dialog: this? What is up with the arm-
dialog: touching?
text: Greg is backing away from her now. She is following.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you just being friendly? Or is
dialog: it, like, this calculated tactic?
dialog: To get me to do whatever you want?
dialog: Because you have to understand what
dialog: it does, when a beautiful, sexy,
dialog: otherwise thoughtful girl touches
text: the arm of a scrawny pasty guy with
text: a groundhog face. It’s an act of
dialog: cruelty.
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Are you done?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah, I’m done with you. And I’m
dialog: done with the stupid film.
text: He backs into ILL PHIL.
speaker_heading: ILL PHIL

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: ILL PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm back for my revenge /

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: Are you honestly gonna stab me?
dialog: Fine. Go for it. You’re gonna go to
dialog: jail for your entire life, but,
dialog: it’s probably worth it. Stab away.
dialog: Ill Phil is not prepared for this. He was hoping Greg’s
dialog: reaction would be more along the lines of running away.
speaker_heading: ILL PHIL
dialog: You lucky I ain’t got my knives.
dialog: Stead you gotta fight me, punk.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Sure. I’1l fight you. Just no
text: rapping.
text: They square up. Onlookers excitedly gather, including a

text: Neither Greg nor Phil makes a move for a long time.

speaker_heading: ILL PHIL GREG (CONT'D)

dialog: Leggo my arm.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Okay. Jesus.
speaker_heading: SCOTT MAYHEW
dialog: Phil! Remember how he has trampled

speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: Come to prom with me.

speaker_heading: MADISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Look. You were right. This whole
dialog: movie situation has been really
dialog: difficult for you, and I feel like
dialog: it’s my fault. I want a chance to
dialog: make things up to you a little bit.
speaker_heading: ILL PHIL
dialog: Yo, you can make things up to me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You want my number?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (to Ill Phil)

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: MADISON

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I appreciate that.
speaker_heading: GREG’S MOM

dialog: She does.
text: Greg examines himself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: GREG’S MOM (CONT’D)
dialog: My handsome boy, going to prom.
dialog: Take lots of pictures, okay?

scene_heading: EXT. IN FRONT OF GREG’S HOUSE - EVENING 84
text: GREG, holding corsage, walks stiffly into a limousine.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE 85

speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER
dialog: You got it, boss.
dialog: They drive.
speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER (CONT’D)
dialog: You love this girl?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Uh. I dunno if I would go that far.
speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER
dialog: Are you kids gonna get busy on my

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I think the odds are against that.

speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER
dialog: Ha. I’m just playing with you, man.
dialog: I hope you do get some.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Thanks. It’s really gonna depend on
dialog: what she wants to do.
speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER
dialog: Well. If you really love her, you
dialog: got a shot. Because she’1ll know.
text: Greg does not respond to this.
speaker_heading: LIMO DRIVER (CONT’D)
dialog: She is fine, though?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I wouldn’t say that.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER 86
text: GREG exits the limo, holding his corsage.
text: He is not in front of Madison’s house. He is front of the
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL.
text: He takes a deep breath.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MAY - EVENING 87
text: RACHEL is suffering from pneumonia, a complication of end-
text: stage AML. She is extremely pale and having difficulty
text: focussing. But she smiles when GREG walks in.
dialog: SUPER: Day 209 of Doomed Friendship
text: DENISE, sitting next to her, smiles with wet eyes, gets up,
text: and hugs Greg for a very long time. Then she leaves the room.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Hey.
text: Her voice is weak and whispery.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I know. I look amazing. Here, let
dialog: me put flowers on you.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 88
dialog: Blue (6/3/14) 92.
text: He puts the corsage on her wrist. It is not romantic. It is
dialog: something else.
text: He extracts his phone and a little projector from his pocket
dialog: and starts setting them up -
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Before we watch this, uh... I’m
dialog: really sorry it took so long to
dialog: make. But the reason for that is,
dialog: we couldn’t figure out how to not
dialog: get it to suck. And we never did
dialog: figure it out. It still sucks, and
dialog: it’s not actually what I wanted to
dialog: say to you. But let’s just watch it
dialog: first. Okay?
text: She nods.
text: He turns on the projector. It projects onto the curtain. He
text: sits next to her, and they watch for a while.
dialog: The film does, as advertised, suck.
text: First, there are the TESTIMONIALS: students sitting in a
dialog: classroom, saying clichéd things, or unhelpful things. So
dialog: those suck.
text: DENISE’S INTERVIEW has been jarringly edited so as not to be
text: depressing, but of course this makes it even more depressing.
dialog: It goes without saying that this sucks.
text: And spliced among all of these sections is a mysterious
dialog: ANIMATION that is never explained and never gets enough time
dialog: to develop. It’s confusing. How could that not suck?
text: As they watch, Rachel begins to cough, weakly. Greg ignores
text: this for a few coughs.
text: Then he realizes that it isn’t going away.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Should I get a nurse?
text: Rachel, nods, coughing, in pain.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY 88
text: SLIGHTLY SLOWED DOWN, SOUND MUFFLED
text: GREG emerges from the room. DENISE is asleep in a chair
text: outside. He jogs her arm. She wakes up, reads his face, and
text: rushes into the room, stricken.
dialog: 89
dialog: 90
dialog: Blue (6/3/14) 93.
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: That was the last time I saw
text: Rachel. She went into a coma
dialog: shortly after that, and died about
text: ten hours later.
text: Greg flags down a passing NURSE and says something to her.
text: Irritably, she walks into Rachel’s room, shutting the door
text: behind her.
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah. I know I told you she didn’t
dialog: die. But I mean... this is a story
text: about a girl with cancer.
text: Greg is left alone in a hospital hallway.
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: What did you think was going to
dialog: happen?
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - THE NEXT DAY 89
text: GREG, EARL, and MR. MCCARTHY are sitting all in a row, near
text: the back. The forceful inner-city PRINCIPAL is speaking.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: It is indeed a difficult time...
dialog: for the Schenley High School
dialog: family. We are mourning... a family
dialog: member. But we have an unexpected
dialog: and touching opportunity... to turn
dialog: our thoughts to her... in a unique
dialog: way.

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - FLASHBACK, LAST NIGHT 90
text: From the hall, through the half-open door, DENISE watches the
text: film projected on Rachel’s curtain.

text: Earl has his head deep in his hands.
scene_heading: INT. TEACHER’S CONFERENCE ROOM - FLASHBACK, EARLIER THAT DAW
text: TEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL watch the film on a computer. They
text: are very moved. They are watching a sock puppet part.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL (V.O.)
dialog: And her mother has given us
dialog: permission... to show you this film
dialog: now.
scene_heading: BACK TO THE PRESENT: 93
text: Greg and Earl are up on stage. Cataclysm. It is, literally,
dialog: the stuff of nightmares.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Before we show the film... Is there
dialog: anything you would like to say...
dialog: to the Schenley High School family.
text: Earl walks to the lectern. The mic is nowhere near his head.
text: The PRINCIPAL, noting this, removes the microphone and holds
text: it to Earl’s mouth.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Naw.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: You will let this audacious film
dialog: speak for you. Very good. Gregory?
text: Greg staggers to his feet. He takes the mic. He gazes out at
dialog: his classmates.
text: He has nothing to say to them. But he can’t just say nothing.
text: Suddenly he begins speaking.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: This film sucks. And after you
dialog: watch it, you’re gonna think I’m
dialog: this pathetic untalented loser. But
dialog: here’s the thing: I don’t care what
dialog: you think about me. I’ve spent the
dialog: last four years obsessing over how
dialog: everyone sees me, and I just
dialog: realized, I don’t care anymore.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Blue (6/3/14) 95.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: The only person whose opinion I
dialog: care about is dead. So, whatever.
text: He puts the mic down, then decides to pick it back up.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve always wanted never to be
dialog: noticed by anyone. But the best way
dialog: not to be noticed is to be dead.
dialog: And I don’t want to be dead.
text: He puts the mic back. The principal, frowning, walks over to
text: reclaim the mic.
text: Then Greg abruptly grabs it a third time.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait. Here’s why our film sucks.
dialog: It’s not the film we should have
dialog: made. Okay? Because I wasn’t even
dialog: friends with Rachel before she got
dialog: sick. And then she got sick and we
dialog: spent all this time together, but
dialog: it wasn’t enough. It just wasn’t.
dialog: To make the film we should have
dialog: made, we should have gotten her to
dialog: tell us every single thought she
dialog: has ever had. Because it’s all just
dialog: lost, now. We should have had a
text: camera on her, constantly, since
dialog: the day she was born. Because her
dialog: whole life, now, it’s just lost. We
dialog: should have had a camera inside her
dialog: head, because all of her specific
dialog: thoughts and ideas and hopes and
dialog: phobias and all of her impressions
dialog: of the whole stupid world, they’re
dialog: all about to be lost, and the film
dialog: we should have made would keep her
dialog: from being lost.
dialog: And I know that happens to
dialog: everyone. It’ll happen to everyone
dialog: in this room. And it'll happen to
dialog: me. But I don’t care. All that I
dialog: can think about is that it happened
dialog: to her. And it happened last night.
dialog: And I can’t deal with it, I’1l
dialog: never be able to deal with it, and
dialog: this film has nothing to do with
dialog: that. Nothing.
dialog: (forcing back tears--semi-
dialog: incoherent)
dialog: It sucks. Nothing sucks more than
dialog: this. It sucks.
dialog: 94
dialog: 95
dialog: Blue (6/3/14) 96.
text: He puts down the mic and walks, then runs, offstage and out
text: of the auditorium. The students are baffled. Some of them are
text: giggling, but from nervousness.
text: Earl has his head in his hands.
text: The lights go down.
speaker_heading: OMITTED 94
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL’S LIVING ROOM - AFTERWARD 95
text: MOURNERS wander around Denise’s house, sitting shiva.
text: GREG spots MADISON and SCOTT MAYHEW together holding hands,
text: talking to DENISE. Surprised and sickened, he avoids them.
text: He gazes, from afar, at the URN on the mantel that contains
text: Rachel’s ashes. He cannot stop looking at it. It is absurd to
text: him, in a way.
text: Suddenly he has been cornered by an OLD PERSON -
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MOURNER
dialog: I heard you made a very nice little
dialog: movie about Rachel’s life.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Oh. Uh, yeah.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MOURNER
dialog: When will it be in theaters?
dialog: Blue (6/3/14) 97.
dialog: Greg does not have the heart to set this doddering old person
dialog: straight.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Soon. Really soon. I’m sure Denise
dialog: will let you know. Can you excuse
dialog: me for a moment?
text: Greg sneaks into the kitchen. He looks around for a place
text: where he can escape all human contact.
text: He gazes out the window, to the backyard, and sees someone.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL’S BACKYARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER 96
text: EARL has spent most of the shiva outside smoking irritably.
text: GREG approaches him.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Look who it is.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Sorry, I haven’t been out of my
dialog: room for a few days.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Yeah. I know. You smell terrible.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I can’t really smell myself.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (matter-of-factly)
dialog: You smell like a homeless dude. And
dialog: I heard even Pitt State ain’t takin
dialog: you no more.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah, well. Whatever.
text: The backyard door opens. DENISE.
speaker_heading: DENISE
dialog: Hi boys.
speaker_heading: EARL GREG

speaker_heading: DENISE

speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: (smiling sadly)
text: Squeak squeak.
speaker_heading: GREG EARL
dialog: (agreeing) (begrudgingly)
dialog: Squeak. Squeak.
text: Denise enters the house. Greg holds the college directory,
dialog: doing nothing.
text: A couple of envelopes fall out. He opens one.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Greg. I heard what happened
dialog: with your classwork, and with Pitt
dialog: State. So I wrote them a letter
dialog: trying to convince them to let you
dialog: back in. There’s a copy in here if
dialog: you want to read it. Hopefully it
dialog: works, because that would mean I
dialog: have powers from beyond the grave.
dialog: But you should probably send them
dialog: something too.
dialog: Goodbye, Greg. You’re a good
dialog: friend. Although if you don’t go to
dialog: college, you’re also an idiot. But
dialog: you already knew that. Love,
dialog: Rachel.
text: At “goodbye,” Greg's eyes blink and go wet.
text: He unfolds the second letter--
speaker_heading: RACHEL (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Pittsburgh State Admissions,
dialog: I am writing on behalf of someone
dialog: so kind and sweet and giving that
dialog: he -
dialog: Blue (6/3/14) 99.
text: He closes it. He can’t read another word. He closes his eyes.
text: Earl clears his throat.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: I know it’s a bad time. But I ain’t
dialog: doin them films with you no more.
text: Greg throws up his arms, like, Jesus Christ. Like it’s not
text: already gut-wrenching enough out here.
speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: I ain’t. I can’t. I’m done.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: I'ma level with you. I never even
dialog: liked makin the damn films. I like
dialog: watchin crazy-ass films. But I
dialog: hated makin em.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Earl, you're the talented one.
dialog: You’re the one who’s supposed to do
dialog: this with his life.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Oh hell no. That’s you. That ain’t
dialog: me. I ain’t gonna be a broke-ass
dialog: artist.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Me, I want to end up like your dad.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (momentarily shocked out
dialog: of misery)
dialog: What?!
text: Greg peers through the window at his DAD, who is alone in the
text: middle of the living room, scratching himself.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Listen, son. I’m just tellin you.
dialog: Your dad’s around. He around all
dialog: the damn time. Fact he around too
dialog: much. Talkin to the cat, starin

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Oh. ...Earl I had no idea th--
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: (needing to move on)
dialog: Don’t be tellin nobody. Now, you.
dialog: You too weird to start a family. So
dialog: you can go ahead and do your broke-

dialog: Me, I’m makin a comfortable life.
dialog: No more films. I’m out.
dialog: Silence.
text: Earl notices GREG’S MOM watching them through the window.
text: She hesitates. But she can’t help herself. She gestures to
text: “smoking” to Earl, then gestures “death,” then gives him a
text: look of reproach.
text: Earl shrugs, baffled.
text: She sticks her head out of the window -
speaker_heading: GREG’S MOM
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Earl, it’s a little inappropriate
dialog: to be smoking a cigarette outside
dialog: of shiva. Of someone who had
dialog: cancer.
text: Oh. Earl philosophically stubs out his cigarette.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Sorry Mrs. Gaines.

dialog: Yeah. I called you my friend. I’m

speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: And you quit, I’ma beat the hell

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: EARL

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: (irritably)
dialog: Feel like we're having a goddamn

text: book under his arm, the letters in his hand.
text: He sits on her bed. Surrounded by pillows.
speaker_heading: Blue (6/3/14) 101A.
text: He takes another look at the letter to him.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: P.S. I’d also like for you to take
dialog: some of my pillows. They’1ll want a
dialog: good home where they’1l be loved.
text: Greg picks up Francesca.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (V.O.)
dialog: P.P.S. Not in the way you’re
dialog: thinking. That’s disgusting.
text: He gazes at the walls. Daniel Craig, Hugh Jackman.
speaker_heading: A98
dialog: 98
dialog: Blue (6/3/14) 102.
text: He looks down at his directory. He opens it -
text: The inside has been CARVED OUT, intricately, into a little
dialog: landscape.
text: He is motionless, gazing at it. It is beautiful and strange.
text: There are three small figures in it. Somehow we know they are
text: Rachel, Greg, and Earl. Rachel’s has pink hair.
text: He runs a finger over the lip of this little fantastical
dialog: place that her hands made.
text: He gazes at her bookshelf. He pulls out a book - no carving
text: in there - another one - again no carving - another -
text: This one is carved out too. A different landscape. Two
text: figures - Rachel (the same color, but her old brown hair) and
text: one who is probably her mom.
text: He finds more and more. A world of landscapes. Different
dialog: styles, from different times in her life. Sometimes he knows
text: who the figures are, and sometimes he doesn’t. The figure
dialog: that is her is always recognizable.
text: There is no broad narrative connecting them. They are just
text: scenes. Not necessarily from her life - perhaps something
text: tangent to it.
dialog: At some point we are no longer seeing the book carvings - we
text: are just watching his face, as he SEES in a way that he never
dialog: has before.
scene_heading: EXT. MURRAY HILL SIDEWALK - AFTERNOON A98
text: Greg walks home slowly, eyes fixed on something unseeable,
text: somehow released, Rachel’s house behind him.
scene_heading: INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 98
text: We're back to where we started: GREG staring at a computer
text: monitor, breathing loudly through his nose.
dialog: Blue (6/3/14) 103.
speaker_heading: GREG (V.O.)
dialog: I know I might seem to you like I
dialog: hate myself and everything I do.
dialog: But really, I just hate everyone
dialog: I’ve ever been. The person I am
dialog: right now is okay.
text: Rachel’s ashes were scattered in a
text: park behind her house. Apparently
dialog: she ran away from home once and
dialog: tried to live there.
dialog: It was this story her aunt told at
text: the funeral. She was trying to
dialog: become a squirrel. She thought she
dialog: could turn into one by just being
dialog: in the forest and wanting it really
dialog: bad.
dialog: I guess maybe that’s what Mr.
dialog: McCarthy meant, about someone’s
text: life continuing to unfold.
dialog: It was weird to be learning
dialog: something new about Rachel after
dialog: she died. But somehow it was
dialog: reassuring as well.
dialog: The printer has just stopped printing the story we have just
text: been told. On the back we see the words, “Somehow it was
dialog: reassuring as well. FIN.”
text: He puts it in an envelope addressed to Pittsburgh State
dialog: University - Department of Admissions.
text: And then he puts a DVD in a jewel case. And then he sticks a
text: Post-It on top of the case, and writes, “WARNING: THE LAST
text: PERSON WHO SAW THIS IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO A COMA AND DIED.”
text: And he puts that in the envelope as well.
text: He seals the envelope.
text: He stares directly at us. We look into his eyes.
text: He crosses them, briefly.
speaker_heading: BLACKOUT.
dialog: NOW YOU ARE DEAD
