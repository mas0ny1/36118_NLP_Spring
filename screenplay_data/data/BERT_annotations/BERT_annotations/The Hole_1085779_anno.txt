speaker_heading: THE HOLE
scene_heading: BLACK... EMPTY... SILENT...
text: ...-for so long that we start to squirm. And then what sound
text: like WHISPERS rising all around us... turning to a LOW
text: RUMBLE... and the blackness suddenly brightens, as we realize
text: the hole we were inside was the TAILPIPE of an old SUV with
text: New York plates, moving away from us... leaving us on the
text: pavement, as it turns into the driveway of a house... a house
dialog: just like all the others on this small town neighborhood
text: street. Except this one has a “Sold” sign in the front yard.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - DAY
text: The SUV parks. DANE PAYTON, (17), good-looking kid despite
text: the pissed-off sneer, climbs out of the passenger door,
text: stares at the house as if he’s looking at his own tomb.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Shit.
text: LUCAS PAYTON, (10), eyes wide with excitement, scrambles out
dialog: of the back.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dane just said shit.
text: The boys’ Mom, SUSAN, (40), steps out of the driver’s door.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don’t say shit, Dane.
text: The words flow without emotion... like Susan’s said it a
text: thousand times before. She wipes her hair from her pretty,
text: but tired face. And it’s more than the long drive... Susan’s
text: is the face of a single mother chasing two boys.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: You told us it wasn’t going to be
dialog: that different than the last place.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It won’t be once we get our stuff
dialog: moved in.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (slapping his neck)
dialog: Except for the bugs, the heat, and
dialog: the twelve-hundred mile walk to go
dialog: hang out with my friends.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You'll make new friends. The bugs
dialog: and heat... those are just a couple
dialog: of the southern charms.
text: Lucas grabs the house key from Susan, and charges to the
text: front door.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I call biggest room.
text: Susan follows after him. Dane stands there alone...
text: staring... gazing up and down this very quiet street. This
dialog: is a world away from New York.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE/FRONT STEPS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Lucas is already inside. Susan’s picking up a “Welcome
text: Basket" from outside the door.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That was nice of someone.
text: Dane approaches, carrying a suitcase and iPod.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: What, Aunt Bee bake us a pie?
text: Susan doesn’t bother to respond... doesn’t matter, because
text: Dane wasn’t waiting around for her to... he walks inside.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY
text: Lucas stands in the doorway of a large, empty bedroom. Dane
text: steps in behind him.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: This is so much cooler than the old
dialog: place. I can put my bed over there,
text: and desk by the window.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: You can put your ass in that little
text: room across the hall.
text: Dane grabs a handful of Lucas’ shirt... tugs him out.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: That one smells like potatoes.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Hold your breath.
text: Lucas tries to push his way back into the room, but Dane
text: easily stops him. Lucas knows the battle’s lost, so...
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Mom, Dane said ass!
speaker_heading: SUSAN (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t say ass, Dane.
text: Dane slams the door... slides down to the floor against it.
dialog: This kid is miserable.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: No furniture yet... just a few unpacked cardboard boxes
text: scattered about. Dane sits on the floor, eating a slice of
text: pizza out of the delivery box, and TEXTING AWAY on his cell
text: phone. The THUMP of rap music tremors from his iPod.
text: Lucas comes bouncing a basketball into the room.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
text: There’s a goal in the street.
dialog: Let’s go play.
text: Dane doesn’t react... just keeps tapping his fingers on the
text: keypad.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: Dane.
text: Still nothing. So Lucas bounces the ball off the top of
text: Dane’s head.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Son of a...
text: Dane jerks his earbuds out.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: What’s your problem?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Let’s play some ball.
text: Dane snatches the basketball... tosses it away... it rolls
text: out of the room.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Have fun.
text: Lucas watches Dane go back to his music and phone, then
text: turns... stomps out... passes Susan in the doorway.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I‘1l play with you, Smooch.
text: Lucas shakes his head... continues outside by himself. Susan
text: slides down to the floor beside Dane... grabs a slice of
text: pizza, then tugs Dane’s earbud out of one ear.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: It’s a change for Lucas too.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: He’s happy anywhere he’s got a room
dialog: to watch Spongebob or whatever.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Or for you to spend a little time
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Any more time and I’d kill him.
text: Dane grabs another slice and stands to leave.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Let’s be happy here, okay?
text: Dane fakes a big, pizza-stuffed smile, and walks out.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - DAY
text: Moving truck in the driveway. Dane, Lucas and Susan joined
text: in with the MOVERS, hauling furniture and boxes into the
dialog: house.
text: Dane pulls a CLOWN MASK from a box... slips it on, then leans
text: around the truck for Lucas to see. Lucas CRIES OUT...
text: stumbles back through the boxes... falls to the yard.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
speaker_heading: MOM!
text: Susan snatches the mask off Dane’s laughing face.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Why did you bring this?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (off Lucas)
dialog: One guess. The little clown freak.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: Mom, Lucas just said shut up.
text: Susan shoves the mask in her pocket.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You two are embarrassing yourselves
dialog: in front of our new neighbor.
text: Dane and Lucas glance beside them, to JULIE CAMPBELL, (17),
text: southern small town Avril Lavigne, sitting on her front
text: porch, stealing glances from the book in her lap.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: (playfully nudges Dane)
text: Beats old Mr. Hyatt hacking up
dialog: phlegm from next door, huh?
text: Dane ignores Susan... grabs a box... a BIG BOX, now that he’s
text: got an audience. He starts toward the house... glances over
text: and makes eye contact with Julie. He nods, she smiles... the
dialog: perfect start. Until...
speaker_heading: LUCAS (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, Dane, where do you want me to
dialog: put all your Clay Aiken cds?
text: Dane’s face falls... he spins around... sees Lucas grinning.
text: Dane’s jaw clenches... he fights the urge to drop the box,
text: and go all “big brother” on Lucas. Instead, he just nods to
text: him... we’re not done here... then continues inside without
text: another glance to the smiling Julie.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You’re in trouble now.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: What’s new.
text: Lucas loads up... starts up the walkway, veering wide to
text: avoid Dane on his way back out. Dane just glares at him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Take that in the basement, okay,
dialog: sweetie?
text: Lucas nods... continues inside.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Why do you baby him so much?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What’s the matter, you jealous?
text: Susan playfully pinches Dane’s cheek. Dane pulls away.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: I used to baby you before you got
dialog: too cool for me. But if you want...
text: Susan goes after Dane again. He dodges behind boxes.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Mom. Cut it out. God.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (tosses a pillow at him)
dialog: What happened to my little boy?
text: Dane glances over... sees that Julie is gone. So he SMACKS
text: Susan over the head with the pillow... there’s still a kid in
dialog: there somewhere.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - DAY
text: Lucas flips on the light at the top of the stairs... barely
text: enough light to see where he’s going, as he carries the box
text: down the bare, scarred, wooden steps.
text: He reaches the cement floor basement... all dust and shadows.
text: Old tools and paint cans rest on metal shelves... boxes of
text: dusty old notebooks and journals are piled in the corner... a
text: rusty freezer chest sits along the wall.
text: Lucas stands at the center of the room, nervously glancing
text: around. AND THEN A FAINT KNOCKING drifts from the back
text: shadows of the room. Lucas squints back toward the sound.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dane?
text: The KNOCKING STOPS... the basement goes quiet... then
text: SCRATCHING... FINGERNAILS OVER WOOD... and that’s more than
text: enough for Lucas... he drops the box, and spins for the
text: stairs... and RIGHT INTO A HULKING FIGURE.
text: Lucas CRIES OUT... then realizes it’s just one of the MOVERS.
speaker_heading: MOVER
dialog: You okay, buddy?
text: Lucas manages a nod, then throws a last glance across the
text: basement before he tears up the steps.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - DAY
text: Dane carries more boxes up the front steps. Lucas charges
text: outside to him.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Have you been downstairs yet?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Dude, look out, this crap’s heavy.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I heard something in the basement.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Probably the ghost of the old lady
dialog: that lived here. Mom says she hung
dialog: herself in that potato room you’re
dialog: sleepin’ in.
text: Lucas’ eyes go wide. Dane moves inside... doesn’t let Lucas
dialog: see his smile. Sometimes it’s fun to be the big brother.
text: Lucas rushes down the walk to Susan.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: What happened to the people that
dialog: lived here before us?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don’t know. Just moved someplace
dialog: else I guess.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dane said you told him the lady
dialog: hung herself in my room.
text: Susan looks at Dane, walking back out of the house. He
text: grins... shrugs.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Coulda happened.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: The only people getting hung in
dialog: that house are you two if you both
dialog: don’t cut it out.
text: Susan carries a load of boxes past them to the house. Dane
text: laughs at Lucas, who gives him a shove, and stomps off.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The windows are dark. No sign of movement.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Darker than dark... just shapes mixed with shadows.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LUCAS’ ROOM - NIGHT
text: Lucas in bed... but he can’t sleep. He shifts... kicks...
text: SNIFFS THE AIR of his potato room... scowls... pulls the
text: blanket up over his nose. And then...
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (soft and gurgling)
dialog: Lucas.
text: Lucas’ eyes flash open.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: Help me, Lucas.
text: Lucas is afraid to breathe... finally rolls slowly over...
text: ...and sees the SHAPE OF A WOMAN HANGING IN HIS OPEN CLOSET
text: DOORWAY... feet swaying in the air.
text: Lucas SCREAMS... hits the light switch beside his bed...
text: .+.the room lights up, and we all see DANE, wearing Susan’s
text: long coat like a dress, and hanging onto the top of the
text: closet doorway with one hand... swinging... and now
text: LAUGHING... hard. So hard that he drops to the floor.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
speaker_heading: MOM!
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (still laughing)
dialog: Awesome scream, man... like a
dialog: little girl’s.
text: Susan comes racing into the room, half-asleep... sees Lucas
text: in bed... Dane on the floor in her coat... and her concern
text: instantly turns to anger. She snaps her finger at Dane...
text: points to the hall.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Out.
text: Dane walks out, still laughing.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: And hang my coat back up.
text: Susan waves for Lucas.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Come on.
text: Lucas jumps out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/SUSAN’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Susan asleep... Lucas curled up beside her, safe and sound.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Dane’s at the kitchen table, drowsily slurping up cereal.
text: Lucas stands at the counter, gnawing on a still-frozen waffle
text: straight out of the box. Susan hurries in, slipping a
text: sweater over her NURSE’S UNIFORM.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Okay, call me if there’s a problem,
dialog: but I don’t want any problems, so
dialog: don’t call me. I need this job to
dialog: go well.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We'll be cool.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Promise me. Both of you.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Promise.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Scouts honor.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (kissing Dane on the head)
dialog: You weren’t a Scout.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I thought about it once though
dialog: because of the cookies.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Those are Girl Scouts, loser.
text: Susan kisses Lucas on the cheek.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No pestering your brother.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Good luck, Mom.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Thanks, sweetie. And you two spend
dialog: some time together today.
text: Susan hurries out the door. Dane and Lucas just continue
text: eating in silence.
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: Lucas walks down the hall... stops in Dane’s doorway... sees
text: him on his bed, listening to is iPod. Lucas keeps walking.
text: Lucas on his bedroom floor, playing with the hamster.
text: Lucas in the living room, playing Xbox by himself.
text: Dane walking out of the kitchen, eating a sandwich... passing
text: Lucas without a word, as he enters to fix his own lunch.
text: Lucas on his bed, tossing a baseball up toward the ceiling,
text: catching it in his glove... tossing it again.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/DANE’S ROOM - DAY
text: Dane stands at his window, peering outside. Lucas steps into
text: the doorway behind him, baseball glove still on.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Let’s go throw.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Busy.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Doin’ what?
text: Dane doesn’t answer. Lucas walks in... looks out the
text: window... and there’s Julie, sunbathing in her back yard. A
text: seventeen year-old boy’s dream.
text: But not a ten year-old’s. Lucas grabs Dane’s glove... tries
text: to shove it into his hand.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: C'mon, you can stare at her from
dialog: outside.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (tosses the glove away)
dialog: Back off. I don’t feel like it.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: You never feel like it.
text: Lucas stomps out. Dane doesn’t even notice he’s gone.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
text: The back door swings open, and here comes Lucas striding out.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/DANE’S ROOM - DAY
text: Dane spots Lucas walking across the yard. Lucas throws a
text: devious grin up at him as he walks toward Julie’s fence.
text: Panic washes over Dane’s face... he knows that look. He taps
text: the window, shaking his head at Lucas.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Don’t do it.
text: Lucas just keeps grinning... and walking.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
text: Lucas reaches the fence... climbs up enough to lean over.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Hey!
text: Julie raises up... squints over at Lucas... smiles.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Hi.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/DANE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Dane drops down to the floor beneath the window.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Shit.
text: He waits as long as he can, then slowly inches up... peeks
text: back out the window...
text: ...to Lucas pointing straight up at him, and Julie shielding
text: her eyes to get a better view of Dane.
dialog: 12.
text: Dane drops back down to the floor like a corpse... actually
dialog: wishes he was dead right now... except he’s got one important
text: thing to do first. So he charges out of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
text: Lucas on the fence, in the middle of his chat with Julie.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dane liked it better in Brooklyn.
dialog: He wishes we hadn’t moved. But I...
text: Suddenly the back door almost flies off its hinges as Dane
text: explodes from the house... races toward Lucas on the fence.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: I gotta go.
text: Lucas leaps off the fence... sprints around the side of the
text: house, with Dane in hot pursuit.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
speaker_heading: MOM!
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: She’s not here to save you this
dialog: time!
text: Lucas races to the SIDE BASEMENT DOOR... barges inside...
text: tries to close it before Dane gets there, but he’s too
text: late... BAM... Dane slams the door open. Lucas dodges around
text: the shelves... throws an old fishing rod at Dane as he runs.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont'd)
text: WHAT’S YOUR PROBLEM, DICKHEAD?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: You shoulda played with me!
text: Dane climbs over an old table to get to Lucas. Lucas backs
text: across the basement... into a metal shelf, TIPPING IT OVER.
text: Both boys freeze, as they watch the shelf tumble, spewing
text: boxes and paint cans all over the place. A lamp SHATTERS.
text: They stare at the wreckage, the fight suddenly stripped out
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Mom is gonna be pissed at you.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: It was your fault.
dialog: 13.
text: They start grabbing boxes and cans... cleaning the mess.
text: Dane lifts one end of the metal shelf.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Get that other side.
text: Lucas grips the other edge... they tilt the shelf back
text: upright. And when they do, they both see...
text: ...the WOODEN TRAPDOOR IN THE CEMENT BASEMENT FLOOR. A two-
text: foot square of scarred wood, with TWO PADLOCKS ON EACH SIDE,
text: securing it shut.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: What is that?
text: Dane shakes his head, no idea. He reaches down... gives it a
dialog: tug... locked.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: That’s a lotta locks.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Probably gas pipes or something.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Or a treasure maybe.
text: Dane rolls his eyes, then pulls on the door again, just in
text: case. No good. So he stands up... starts searching the area.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Look for the keys.
text: Lucas digs over the shelves. Dane spots a pair of PRUNING
text: SHEARS... strains to cut through one of the locks. Not even
text: close. He tosses them away... jerks on the trap door again.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: They’re not down here.
text: Lucas steps back toward Dane, accidentally kicking one of the
text: FALLEN PAINT CANS as he moves... and we all hear the JINGLE
text: OF METAL from inside the can as it rolls.
text: Dane and Lucas look at each other, then scramble after the
text: can. Dane grabs it first... jerks out a RING OF KEYS. They
text: exchange a grin, and Dane goes to work on the locks...
text: searching and matching each key to its own lock... snapping
text: them open one by one, until they’re all clear.
text: The boys stare down at the trap door.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: If there’s treasure, I get half.
text: They grip the handle together... Lucas’ little hand right
text: beside Dane’s larger... pull the wooden door back on its
dialog: hinges...
text: ...revealing nothing but a SOLID BLACK HOLE.
dialog: And this isn’t just a shallow niche in the floor... this is
text: deep... solid black... like staring into a hole in the
dialog: universe.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
text: It’s just a hole.
text: Dane peers into the blackness, trying to get a better view.
text: He reaches his hand in just a few inches, but the darkness
text: swallows it like a black mouth. He jerks it back out.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: It’s cold.
text: Dane glances around the basement... spots a flashlight...
text: grabs it, and switches it on. He crawls back to the hole...
text: shines the light down.
text: But again, the darkness overpowers the beam... chokes the
text: life from it only a few feet down.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: How deep do you think it is?
text: Dane lifts a fallen nail from the floor beside them... drops
text: it in. The nail sinks into the black... gone... not a sound.
text: The boys exchange a glance. Lucas crawls over the open trap
text: door, dragging a PAINT CAN back across...
text: ...WITHOUT NOTICING ALL THE SCRATCHES CLAWED ALONG THE INSIDE
text: OF THE WOODEN DOOR.
text: Lucas holds the can above the hole until Dane gives him a
text: nod... he drops it... the can falls... disappears. They wait
dialog: for the clank that never comes.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Maybe it’s a real deep tunnel.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: To where?
dialog: 15.
text: Dane shakes his head... no idea. Dane aims the flashlight
text: again... they each lean their heads directly over the hole.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: POV FROM INSIDE THE HOLE...
text: .»..on the brothers’ faces peering in from opposite sides...
text: heads joined at the top.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: There’s gotta be a bottom.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Hello!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE BOYS - RISING BACK AWAY FROM THE HOLE...
text: »+.asS a grin spreads across Lucas’ face.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A TALKING SOUTHPARK CARTMAN DOLL...
text: ...-the flashlight duct-taped around it, with a LONG STRING
text: tied around his neck like a hangman’s noose.
text: Dane and Lucas kneel beside the hole. Lucas holds the
text: string, easing Cartman and the flashlight into the darkness.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Screw you guys, I’m going home!
text: The string slides over Lucas’ fingers... Cartman and the
text: light descend further... a few feet down.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN (V.O.) (cont’d)
dialog: I would never let a woman kick my
dialog: ass. If she tries anything, I'd be
dialog: like...
text: And then the black just swallows Cartman, his voice, the
text: light... everything just vanishes.
text: Lucas quickly pulls the string, and the doll and flashlight
text: appear from the darkness.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: ...-back in the kitchen and make me
dialog: some pie!
text: Dane and Lucas exchange a smile. Lucas drops Cartman again.
speaker_heading: CARTMAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: Yes, the fireman is very magical.
dialog: If you...
text: Then Cartman’s gone again.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: How does it do that?
text: Dane just shakes his head. Then suddenly, Lucas’ HAND
text: JERKS... the string tugs... HARD... like a fish just hit a
text: baited hook.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: What’d you do?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Nothin’. I think it got caught on
dialog: something.
text: Lucas winds the string back up... just a frayed end. Cartman
text: and the light are gone.
speaker_heading: JULIE (0.S.)
dialog: So you two didn’t kill each other?
text: Lucas and Dane shoot up, startled by the voice... see Julie
text: in the basement door, a long t-shirt that reads, “I’m Not A
text: Fairy-Tale Princess. Get Over It", hangs over her bikini.
text: Dane stands up... steps between Julie and the hole.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: She’s Julie.
text: Dane nods hello.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: And you’re Dane. The one that
dialog: hates it here.
text: Dane shoots Lucas a glare.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Do you wanna look at our hole?
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I’m sorry?
text: Dane shoots Lucas a look... idiot.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Nothin’. There’s just a hole in
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: And that’s what people do for fun
dialog: in Brooklyn?
text: Julie walks around Dane toward Lucas.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: Play around with their holes?
text: But then Julie sees the hole, and this is obviously not a
dialog: normal hole.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: Our hole.
text: Dane closes the basement door.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We're not sure what it is.
text: Julie squints into the bottom. Lucas pulls another
text: flashlight from a box... hands it to Julie. She shines the
text: flashlight into the black.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: We can’t see the bottom.
text: Julie sticks one of her bare feet down into the darkness, but
text: Dane grabs her.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I wouldn’t do that.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It’s just a crawlspace or
dialog: something.
text: But then Lucas rolls another paint can into the hole... Julie
text: watches it vanish without a sound.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: That’s really weird.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Dane glances around the basement... spots the OLD FISHING
text: ROD. He lifts it... stretches out the lure-ended line...
text: knots it around the metal handle of another paint can, then
text: holds the can over the hole.
text: Lucas and Julie watch intently, as Dane releases the reel
text: clasp... the can drops... the line WHIZZES OUT... the reel
text: spins like a motor, faster and faster... the fishing line
text: unwinding at a dizzying pace... growing thinner and thinner
dialog: on the spool...
text: .--and Dane, Lucas and Julie are all just watching the reel
text: spin... the line pull, as the weighted can drags it out...
text: until finally, the last of the fishing line unravels from the
text: spool... disappears into the hole.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: O-kay.
text: Lucas has a smile spread across his face.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: This is so cool.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Maybe it’s one of those
dialog: sinkholes... like in California or
dialog: wherever when the streets open up
text: and the cars drop into them.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (thinks of something)
dialog: Hang on.
text: Dane takes off for the stairs. Lucas and Julie look back to
text: the hole... exchange a glance, then race after him.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Wait up, Dane!

text: ANGLE ON THE VIEWFINDER OF A VIDEO CAMERA...
text: ...with Julie’s face filling the frame.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: JULIE (V.O.)
dialog: Is it working?
text: And then we see Dane holding the camera. There’s a rope tied
text: around it. He SWITCHES ON THE CAMERA LIGHT, then gently
text: lowers the camera down into the depths.
text: And just like with everything else, the blackness swallows
dialog: the camera.
text: Dane lets the rope slip across his fingers... easing the
text: camera deeper... deeper... until finally, he stops... holds
dialog: it secure.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: What do you think you’re gonna see?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Whatever’s down there.
text: Dane slowly twists the rope, turning the camera in a circle.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: There’s nothing down there. It’s a
dialog: hole.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Maybe it’s like an underground
dialog: tomb... the Catacombs or something.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: The Catacombs of Bensonville. I
dialog: doubt it.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I say it’s a treasure.
text: Dane twists and pulls the rope, working to get every angle
text: with the camera.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That’s good. Let’s go watch it.
dialog: See what the inside of a hole looks
dialog: like.
text: Dane nods... pulls the rope up, until the camera reappears
text: out of the hole. He slams the trap door closed, and they
text: charge up the stairs.
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Dane, Lucas and Julie are all squatted on the floor in front
text: of the television, staring at the black screen. Dane’s got
text: the video camera in his lap... the cables running to the tv.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I told you. There’s nothing down
text: there. It’s just a hole.
speaker_heading: DANE
text: A hole with no bottom in the
dialog: basement of a house. How does that
dialog: make sense? And why are there a
dialog: buncha locks on it?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: To keep kids like us from fallin’
dialog: in?
text: Julie nods to Dane. But then a WHISP OF MOVEMENT on the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Did you see that?
text: Dane rewinds the video... replays it... a BLURRED SHAPE
scene_heading: FLASHES PAST.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Right there.
text: Dane rewinds... plays... pauses on the dim mass.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: That’s something.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: And anything. Light coming through
text: a crack in the wall.
text: The front door opens behind them... Susan’s home. The kids
text: all jump to their feet, spinning to her...
text: .-.and DON’T SEE THE DIM IMAGE OF A HUMAN FACE APPEAR ON THE
text: SCREEN, ITS MOUTH STRETCHED OPEN INHUMANLY WIDE.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hey, guys.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Hi, Mom. We were just watching tv.
dialog: 21.
text: Behind the kids, the ONSCREEN FACE SEEMS TO TURN TOWARD THE
text: VOICES... STARE OUT AT THEM.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (off the image)
dialog: Yeah. What is that?
text: The face drifts out of view, before Dane spins back to turn
text: it off... only blackness again.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Some stupid show. We were getting
dialog: ready to turn it off. And this is
text: Julie... from next door.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hey, Julie.
dialog: (holds up a bag)
dialog: I brought plenty of Chinese if
dialog: you're hungry.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Thank you, but I better go. My
dialog: mom’s probably looking for me.
dialog: (to Dane)
dialog: I’ll see you later.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Yeah... cool.
text: Julie starts for the door.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: It was nice meeting you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You too, Julie.
text: Julie leaves. Susan starts for the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: So what did you guys do all day?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: We found this sweet...
text: Dane throws his hand over Lucas’ mouth... shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Just hung out. How was the new job?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Good.
text: Susan throws a shocked look back at Dane.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Did you really just ask a question
dialog: about my life? Wow... a couple
dialog: days in the South, and look how
dialog: polite you are.
text: Dane fakes a laugh... they continue into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - DAY
text: TIGHT ON THE TRAP DOOR... the locks resting beside it. Then
text: the door BEGINS TO INCH SLOWLY OPEN.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/DANE’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dane in bed, eyes closed... looking asleep, but...
speaker_heading: LUCAS (0.S.)
dialog: We could get a ladder and climb
dialog: down.
text: ...there’s Lucas sprawled under a blanket on the floor, wide
text: awake... excited.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: There’s no ladder that long.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Like one of those fire truck
dialog: ladders. Or we tie a rope around
dialog: somebody... drop ‘em down there.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We’re not droppin’ anybody in the
dialog: hole, dude. Now go to sleep.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And remember, don’t tell Mom.
dialog: It'll just freak her out, and she
dialog: won’t let us figure out what it is.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: What if the guy that lived here
dialog: before was a bank robber, and he
dialog: hid like a hundred million dollars
dialog: down there. We could get it... buy
dialog: whatever we wanted.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (exhausted)
dialog: Dude... shut up.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Mom wouldn’t have to work anymore.
dialog: We could move back to our old
dialog: house.
text: Dane’s eyes suddenly open... that does sound good.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We’1l check it out again tomorrow.
dialog: Now go to sleep or go back to your
dialog: own room.
text: Lucas closes his eyes... smiles at all the possibilities
text: bouncing around in his head.
scene_heading: INT. JULIE'S HOUSE/JULIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Julie’s propped up in her bed, listening to her iPod as she
text: reads. And we can hear the music too... until Julie’s lamp
text: FLICKERS OFF... her music goes silent.
text: Julie glances around... flicks the lamp switch... taps the
dialog: iPod... nothing.
text: And then somewhere, a LITTLE GIRL GIGGLES. Julie’s eyes scan
text: the room... then from BELOW HER...
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: You can’t find me.
text: Julie stops breathing... sits there frozen... just her eyes
text: rolling down to the edge of the bed... toward the floor. She
text: holds back as long as she can, then leans over.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: JULIE'S POV...
text: .--gliding over the edge of the bed... to the floor... empty.
text: JULIE SLOWLY LEANS FURTHER... her head almost touching the
text: ground as she stretches to see under the bed... closer...
text: closer... the shadowy boxes and dirty clothes coming into
dialog: view...
text: ...-when JULIE'S iPOD SUDDENLY BLASTS BACK ON. Julie jerks
text: with a start... rolls off the bed... hits the floor with a
text: THUD... the LAMP FLICKERS BACK ON...
dialog: 24.
text: -..and Julie sees there’s no one under her bed.
text: She rolls her eyes, almost embarrassed, then climbs back up.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - DAY
text: Susan, dressed for work, walks toward her car. Dane and
text: Lucas stand at the front door, waving goodbye, and itching to
dialog: get her out of here so they can slam the door shut, and get
text: down to the hole.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: If there's a problem, the hospital
text: number’s by the phone.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: But you don’t want any problems.
dialog: Got it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And there’s plenty of food in the
dialog: fridge. Make sure you eat some
dialog: fruit. No more Cool Whip and
dialog: chocolate sauce.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: You told us that already.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Five times.
text: Susan starts to climb in... the boys start to shut the
text: door... until Susan steps back out again.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And be nice to each other.
speaker_heading: DANE AND LUCAS
dialog: Promise!
text: Susan waves again... finally backs out of the drive... pulls
text: away. The boys stand waving until she disappears, then
text: WHAM... the door SLAMS SHUT.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Lucas and Dane rush around the room, grabbing rope... an
dialog: extra flashlight.
text: And then Dane freezes... because Julie is standing at the
text: back door in her bikini, waving in at him. She cracks the
text: door, and leans in.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Some people are hangin’ out at my
dialog: place, if you wanna come over?
dialog: (off Dane’s rope and
dialog: flashlight)
dialog: Unless you've got hole business.
text: Dane’s frozen... except for his eyes, bouncing from Julie and
text: her bikini to Lucas, already at the basement door, VIOLENTLY
text: SHAKING HIS HEAD.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (to Lucas)
dialog: Dude.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY
text: Dane trots out the back door toward Julie’s, wearing shorts,
text: with a towel tossed over his shoulder. Lucas stands at the
text: door, ready to explode.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: That hole’s not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Neither is she.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Can’t take the chance. And don’t
dialog: go down there till I get back.
text: Lucas watches Dane jump the fence into Julie’s yard... joins
text: a group of other TEENS. And Lucas is left alone... again.
text: He walks back into the house... slams the door shut.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - DAY
text: From the bottom of the steps, we watch as the basement door
text: drifts open... and there’s Lucas filling the doorway. He
text: stares down the steps, deciding whether to descend or not...
text: finally does, pulling the door closed behind him.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - LATER
text: Lucas fits the keys into the locks... pops them open... lays
text: them off to the side. He grabs the handle of the trap
text: door... hesitates a beat before he lifts it, pulling the
text: square of wood back... revealing that coal black hole.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: EXT. JULIE'S HOUSE/POOL - DAY
text: Kids splashing and playing. Dane and Julie trying to dunk
text: each other under water.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - DAY
text: Lucas props a hand against the edge, and leans directly out
text: over the hole... gazes down into the emptiness, then lets a
text: thick gob of spit fall from his lips.
text: It hits the black and immediately vanishes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: POV FROM DOWN INSIDE THE HOLE...
text: .--looking back up at Lucas.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JULIE'S HOUSE/POOL - DAY
text: The party’s still rocking. Dane and Julie lie side by side
text: on blankets, soaking up the rays.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - DAY
text: Lucas slides down to his stomach... nervously reaches his
text: hand into the darkness of the hole. He senses something and
text: pulls it back out, then builds up his nerve again...
dialog: stretching deeper... deeper...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: POV FROM DEEP DOWN INSIDE THE HOLE...
text: .+..as Lucas’ hand reaches down toward us. Our POV starts
text: gliding up... floating toward Lucas and his hand.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 27.
dialog: LUCAS...
text: ...reaching down as far as he can into the hole... just as
text: the UPSTAIRS DOOR SWINGS OPEN.
speaker_heading: DANE (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, Mucas!
text: Lucas jerks his arm up in a panic... grabs the trap door, and
text: eases it back shut.
speaker_heading: DANE (0.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: You down there?
text: Lucas darts toward the outside basement door... eases it
text: open, and slips out... just as Dane moves a few steps down
text: the stairs... peers into the empty basement... sees the
text: closed trap door... walks back up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Dane rises from the basement, just as Lucas strolls in the

speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Where’ve you been?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
text: Outside... playin’ basketball.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Well c’mon, we’re gonna go grab
dialog: some ice cream.
text: Lucas sees Julie waiting at the back door.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: What about the hole?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We’1l check it out when we get
dialog: back. Hurry up.
text: Lucas GRUNTS... follows Dane outside.
scene_heading: EXT. ICE CREAM SHOP - DAY
text: Dane and Julie sitting at a table, laughing together as they
text: work on a couple double dip cones.
text: A few tables away, Lucas sits alone, letting his ice cream
text: melt in the sun, as he draws a picture on a napkin...
dialog: 28.
text: of Dane and Julie, with goofy, oversized lips puckered
text: against each other, and a giant-headed monster standing over
text: them, mouth gaping, ready to swallow them both.
text: As Dane laughs, he glances past Julie... spots something in
text: the distance... a FIGURE... too far away to recognize, but he
text: seems to be just watching them.
text: Dane’s smile fades. Julie notices it.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What is it?
text: Dane snaps out of his stare... looks at Julie and shakes his
text: head... then squints back toward the figure... GONE.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE/BACKYARD - EVENING
text: Lucas charges through the fence from Julie’s house, with Dane
text: walking behind him.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Hurry! We can mess with it some
text: more before Mom gets home.
text: Dane just keeps striding behind him.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: Lucas races inside... sees Susan reading on the couch.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hey, smooch.
text: Lucas’ shoulders fall. Susan walks to him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Don’t act so excited to see me.
text: Dane enters, as Susan plants a kiss on Lucas’ cheek... with
text: Lucas glaring up at Dane. Dane shrugs.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: What happened to you two?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dane made me go get ice cream so he
dialog: could flirt with his new
dialog: girlfriend.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We just hung out with Julie for a
dialog: little while.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: All day.
text: Lucas walks for the stairs... gives the basement door a kick
text: as he goes past.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I grabbed a pizza if you’re hungry?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I’m not.
text: Lucas just disappears up the stairs.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What’s the matter with him?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I don’t know. Tired I guess.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LUCAS’ ROOM - EVENING

text: starts tapping the buttons.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Dark and quiet.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LUCAS’ ROOM - NIGHT
text: Lucas still dressed, asleep on the bed, video game still in

scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/DANE’S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: Dane sleeping... until...
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Boy...
text: Dane’s eyes flash open... dart around.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Lucas.
dialog: 30.
text: Dane glances around the room... his eyes drift to the
text: closet... the door standing open, revealing all that darkness
text: inside. Dane stares at it a beat, then stands... walks over
text: and closes the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: POV FROM THE HALL...
text: .»»-on Dane inside the room, pushing the closet door closed...
text: as THE FIGURE OF A MAN PASSES DOWN THE HALL... and Dane never
dialog: saw him.
text: Dane walks away from the closet door... toward the hall...
text: steps out, and we’re just waiting for whoever that was to
text: grab Dane... but nothing happens.
text: And Dane moves halfway down the down the hall... into the
text: bathroom... to the sink... turns on the water, and sticks his
text: head under to gulp it back. He twists the faucet back off...
text: the house is eerily silent.
text: Dane walks back out into the hall... down the hallway to his
dialog: room... and again we’re just waiting for that man to leap
text: from the shadows... but no. And Dane moves back into the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/DANE’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Dane climbs back into his bed... gets comfortable... then
text: SEES SOMETHING...
text: «..THE CLOSET DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.
text: Dane stares at it, confused... even a little nervous. He
text: stares at that deep, dark rectangle of black emptiness
text: staring back at him... hiding everything it holds.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Lucas. I know you’re in there.
text: Dane rises out from under the blanket... eases toward the
text: closet... nearer... closer... almost there, as he reaches out
text: for the door... gets his hands on it to slam it back closed,
dialog: then...
text: ...SEES THE TWO FILTHY BARE FEET HALF-HIDDEN UNDER CLOTHES.
text: Dane’s eyes shoot up... to the SHADOWY FACE PEERING OUT FROM
text: BEHIND SOME HANGING SHIRTS.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Shit!
text: He slams the door... scrambles back, grabbing a BASEBALL BAT
text: from the floor, and flipping on the light. He stares at the
text: closet, heart racing.
text: Suddenly Lucas steps in from the hall.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: What’re you doin’?
text: Dane jumps with a start... almost goes all Barry Bonds on
dialog: Lucas.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: There’s somebody in my closet.
text: Now Lucas is scared. But Dane feels braver with Lucas
text: there... leans to the door... to the handle.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Maybe you shouldn’t do that.
text: But Dane is doing that. He grabs the handle... pulls the
text: closet door open...
text: .--and with the light on, we can all see there’s nothing but
text: a DEREK JETER CARDBOARD STANDEE peering from behind the
text: clothes. Lucas snorts with laughter... loves finally seeing
dialog: Dane scared.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: (snorts with laughter)
dialog: Nice call. If you’re too scared,
dialog: I‘1ll ask him for an autograph for
dialog: you.
text: Lucas LAUGHS his way out of the room... leaving Dane alone...
text: confused. He reaches over... flips off the bedroom light...
text: looks back at the cardboard face... maybe it was just dark.
text: Dane closes the door... slides a chair over under the handle
text: to keep it closed, then backs his way into bed.
text: He lies there... staring at that closet door.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LUCAS’ ROOM - DAY
text: Lucas is dressed in a collared shirt, tucked into jeans, as
text: Susan hovers over him, quickly brushing his hair. Lucas is
dialog: not happy.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Why do I have to do it today?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Because today’s registration at
dialog: your school, and because I changed
dialog: my shift at the hospital to do it.
dialog: Now hold still, we're late.
text: Susan secures Lucas’ chin to get a better grip. Dane steps
text: into the room, in shorts and t-shirt, flipping his phone
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Why doesn’t Dane have to go?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Because I’m in a school where they
dialog: don’t make you take naps and drink
text: out of sippy cups.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Neither do we, dickhead.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hey!
dialog: (to Dane)
dialog: I know he didn’t learn that one
dialog: from Spongebob.
dialog: (back to Lucas)
dialog: And Dane’s not going because his
dialog: registration is next week.
dialog: (to Dane)
dialog: What are you doing this morning,
dialog: besides trying to cause trouble?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Julie’s gonna show me around this
dialog: ghost town. We're gonna try to see
dialog: everything there is in less than
dialog: ten minutes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Just be back here by four. I have
dialog: to work tonight.
text: Susan walks past Dane, kissing him on the head as she passes.
text: Lucas follows her, and Dane grabs his arm... waits for Susan
dialog: to move out of range, then...
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Don’t say anything to Mom about
dialog: last night.
dialog: 33.
text: Lucas pulls away from Dane.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Who’s the baby now?
text: Dane makes a move for Lucas, but he hurries after Susan.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/ENTRY - DAY
text: Susan opens the door to leave, and there’s Julie, just about
dialog: to ring the bell.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, hey, Julie.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Hi, Mrs. Payton.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: We're on our way out, but Dane’s
dialog: upstairs.
dialog: (yelling back)
dialog: Dane, Julie’s here.
dialog: (to Julie)
dialog: You guys have fun.
text: Dane comes walking down the stairs behind them, slipping on
text: his shoes.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - DAY
text: Susan shoves Lucas into the car, waves back to Dane and Julie
text: at the front door.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Four o'clock. Don’t be late.
text: Dane waves... got it. They watch Susan pull away... and
text: Lucas hang out the window.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Watch out for Derek Jeter!
text: Lucas ducks back in, laughing.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What’s that mean?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Nothing. He’s an idiot. You ready?
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Bensonville, here we come.
text: They walk toward the street.
scene_heading: EXT. BENSONVILLE/MAIN-STREET -— DAY
text: Mayberry with a facelift. Dane and Julie walk down the
dialog: sidewalk.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: So did you guys get all moved in?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Unfortunately.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What, you’d rather be back in New
dialog: Jersey or wherever?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: It was Brooklyn actually.
dialog: Philadelphia, Boston and Queens
dialog: before that. Maybe Jersey was in
dialog: there somewhere.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: So do you even bother to unpack the
dialog: boxes?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Every time. My Mom’s always sure
text: the next move is the last one.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: She seems nice.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: She’s cool, I guess. She’s a nurse
text: over at the hospital.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What about your Dad?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Not so cool.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He’s been locked up since Lucas was
dialog: a baby... is supposed to get out
dialog: soon. I was just a little kid back
dialog: then, so I’m not worried about him
dialog: anymore. But my mom’s not real
text: anxious for a reunion.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont'd)
dialog: She won’t admit it, but I think
dialog: that’s why we keep doing the moving
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Bensonville’s a great place to hide
text: out. He can’t look someplace
dialog: nobody even knows exists. And it
dialog: really isn’t that bad here. I mean
dialog: school sucks, but it probably
dialog: sucked in Brooklyn too, right?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Pretty much.
text: Dane notices a COUPLE GIRLS staring at them from across the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You guys are like celebrities
dialog: around here. Most people move out
dialog: of Bensonville, not into it.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Plus you moved into Freaky
text: Franklin’s house.
dialog: (off Dane’s look)
dialog: The guy that lived there before
dialog: you... Ethan Franklin. He was like
dialog: crazy or something. They ended up
text: dragging him off to the psycho
dialog: hospital or something.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (rolls his eyes)
dialog: Home sweet home.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/ENTRY - DAY
text: Lucas charges through the front door.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dane!

speaker_heading: DANE!
text: Susan walks in behind him.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: He’s probably still out with Julie.
dialog: He’1l be home soon.
text: Lucas hurries up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/HALLWAY - DAY
text: Lucas runs to Dane’s doorway... looks in... empty. His body
text: slumps.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Lucas is on the floor playing xbox. Susan is behind him on
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, I said to be home by four, not
dialog: start home then. Just hurry.
dialog: 
text: Susan hangs up... bends down to kiss Lucas on the head.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: I’ve got to get to work, but Dane’s

speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: I love you, Sweetie.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (in his video game drone)
dialog: Love you too.
text: Susan hustles for the door.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And don’t stay up too late. I’11
dialog: come check on you when I get home.
text: Lucas just nods as he continues playing, doesn’t even notice
text: Susan walk out, as his fingers dance over the buttons, until
text: his futuristic soldier dies a bloody alien death onscreen.
text: Lucas tosses the controller away... turns the game off. He
text: glances around, already bored. He pulls himself up... starts
dialog: for the stairs.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LUCAS’ ROOM - DAY
text: Lucas enters... grabs his pad and pencil, then notices the
text: CLOWN MARIONETTE PROPPED UP ON HIS PILLOW. It’s almost human
text: looking... round face poking out from under the long, red and
text: gold, belled hat. It’s painted eyes stare at Lucas.
text: Lucas returns the stare, nervous at first, then realizing how
text: it got there... Dane. He throws an angry glare back out into
text: the hall, and grabs the clown by the arm... jerks it off the
text: bed, drags it out the door. The clown’s bells jingle against
dialog: the floor.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/DANE’S ROOM - DAY
text: Lucas shoves the marionette under Dane’s sheets... pulls them
text: back to get the full effect of the reveal, then snickers at
text: his little trick. He tosses the covers back over the clown,
text: starts out, then stops... sees the VIDEO CAMERA on the floor.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - DAY
text: Dark... quiet... until the FLICK OF THE LIGHT SWITCH casts a
text: dim glow over the room.
text: Lucas moves down the steps, carrying the camera. He walks
text: past the rusty freezer chest... the shelves of tools... to
text: the trap door. He pulls the trap door open, folding it back
text: onto the floor...
text: .--and there’s that hole, so black it almost glows. Lucas
text: crouches down beside it.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (into hole)
dialog: Hello!
text: He waits for his echo, but the hole swallowed it, just like
text: it does everything else. Lucas grabs the flashlight from the
text: floor... aims the beam into the center of the black... still
dialog: doesn’t help.
text: AND THEN A JINGLE... but it’s not coming from the hole, it’s
text: coming from the back corner of the basement.
text: Lucas’ head shoots up... he squints into the shadows...
text: raises the flashlight...
text: .-».the circle of light rises up the floor... to THE CLOWN
text: MARIONETTE sitting in the corner of the basement, staring
text: back at Lucas.
dialog: 38.
text: Lucas freezes... except for his heart, which is about to beat
text: right out of his chest. He stares back at the clown, wanting
text: to run, but also afraid to look away...
text: .»+.SoO Lucas and the clown just hold their gaze on each
text: other... like a bizarre stare contest... eyes locked...
dialog: neither flinching...
text: -..until THE CLOWN BLINKS.
text: Lucas flies backward... drops the flashlight... it hits the
text: cement floor and rolls into the hole... disappears.
text: Then here comes that clown... CRAWLING OUT OF THE SHADOWS ON
text: ALL FOURS, like some invisible puppeteer is controlling its
text: limbs. The basement is filled with the TINKLING BELLS.
text: Lucas CRIES OUT... scrambles to his feet... throws another
text: glance to the marionette... crawling fast... too fast.
text: Lucas takes off... charges for the steps... races up...
text: stumbles... SLAM... falls... doesn’t want to look back, but
text: we can all hear those BELLS GROWING LOUDER, so Lucas does
text: look... just in time to see the clown starting up the steps
text: after him like some kind of horrible insect.
text: Lucas SCREAMS... crawls up the rest of the stairs... fights
dialog: with the door handle enough to make us think he might not get
text: out, as the marionette scurries up behind him.
text: But then Lucas does get it open... he dives out.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Lucas slams the door closed, just as the clown reaches the
text: top step. He takes a step back... eyes the silent door...
text: then watches the DOORKNOB BEGIN TO TURN.
text: Lucas throws his weight against the door, pressing it shut.
text: Suddenly a HAND DROPS ONTO LUCAS’ SHOULDER. Lucas SCREAMS...
text: spins... right into Dane. Lucas dives against Dane, hugging
text: him... sliding back around behind him.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: What’s wrong with you?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: It came after me.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: What?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: That clown doll... the one you
dialog: tried to scare me with. It’s
dialog: trying to get up here.
text: Dane’s too confused to even ask, so he reaches for the door.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: WAIT!
text: Too late... Dane has it swung open... AND THERE’S NO CLOWN.
text: Lucas peeks out around Dane’s body... squints down the steps.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: It was right there. It chased me.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: A doll chased you.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (nods furiously)
dialog: The one you put in my bed.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I don’t know what you’re talkin’
dialog: about, but I didn’t put any clowns
dialog: in your bed. I might have if I
dialog: thought about it, but I didn’t.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: It was there.
speaker_heading: DANE
text: On the steps.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: In my bed, then I put it in your
dialog: bed to scare you, then it was
dialog: downstairs.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Okay, you know what, there’s all
dialog: kinds of weird crap goin’ on in
dialog: there...
dialog: (taps Lucas’ head)
dialog: ...that I don’t even wanna know
dialog: about, so whatever. The clown’s
dialog: gone, so we're cool.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: It’s still down there somewhere!
dialog: 40.
text: Lucas’ head’s about to explode, so Dane just GROANS... starts
text: down the steps.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Lucas hangs onto the back of Dane’s shirt, as they descend
text: into the basement. They move across the room, with Lucas
text: holding on... spinning around for any sneak attacks from the
text: rear. Then Dane sees the open trap door.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: You weren’t supposed to keep
dialog: messing with that.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: And you were supposed to be home
dialog: before Mom left.
text: Dane glances around... squints into the shadows.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Well there’s no clown, so can we go
dialog: back up?
text: Lucas points into the dark corner.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: It was over there.
text: Lucas shoves Dane toward the corner... follows right behind,
text: not letting loose of that handful of shirt. They reach the
dialog: wall... still nothing.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Maybe it’s one of those man-eating,
text: invisible clown dolls.
text: And then a THUMP... SCRAPE from behind them. They turn...
text: see a LITTLE GIRL, (7), SITTING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS.
text: Her back is to them, as she bounces a small ball... THUMP...
text: scoops up several jacks... SCRAPE. He long blonde hair hangs
text: down over her PINK PARTY DRESS.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Who the hell’s that?
text: Lucas just shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: (to the little girl)
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 41.
text: No answer... just THUMP... SCRAPE. Dane suddenly looks a
dialog: little nervous.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Is she one of your little friends?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: No.
text: Dane watches her drop the ball again... THUMP... SCRAPE...
text: then starts toward her.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Little girl.
text: The girl doesn’t glance back... doesn’t even alter her
text: rhythm... just keeps playing those jacks... THUMP...
scene_heading: SCRAPE... THUMP... SCRAPE.
text: Dane and Lucas move closer to her back... closer... closer...
text: until they’re standing right over the little girl, as she
text: stares down, playing.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Are you lost or something?
text: And then the little girl picks up the last of the jacks...
text: SCRAPE... then slowly looks up at the boys... and her face is
text: so pale it’s almost blue... her eyes are solid black, and
text: it’s like she is CRYING TEARS OF BLOOD.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: I don’t want to die.
text: Dane scrambles backward, dragging Lucas with him. They both
text: back against the wall... watch the little girl stand... walk
text: slowly up the steps.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dane?
text: Dane’s too scared to answer... just watches her disappear
text: through the doorway. Then he moves to the bottom of the
text: steps... stretches to see if she’s still there... she isn’t.
text: So the brothers start up.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: Why don’t we just stay down here?
text: Dane keeps moving up... so Lucas does too.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog: 42.
text: Dane and Lucas lean in the doorway... glance around... no
text: sign of the little girl.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Hey!
text: Nothing. So Dane builds up the nerve to step through. They
text: glance around... see the FRONT DOOR CRACKED OPEN.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Did you close that when you came
dialog: home?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I don’t remember.
text: The brothers move as one toward the door.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Dane and Lucas step outside... glance up and down the street.
text: She isn’t out here either. But Julie is, reading a magazine
text: on her front porch.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: You didn’t see a little girl out
dialog: here did you?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
text: With blood dripping out of her
dialog: eyes?
text: Dane elbows Lucas... shut up.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: She had this makeup or something on
text: her face.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Do you know her?
text: Dane shakes his head. Julie tosses the magazine, and skips
text: off the porch.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: And she was in your house?
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
text: Playing jacks down in the basement.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Jacks?
dialog: (off their nod)
dialog: Maybe she knows that other guy...
dialog: thought he still lived here.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Yeah. Maybe.
text: Julie reaches them.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Did you ask her?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (nods )
dialog: She said she didn’t want to die.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (to Lucas)
dialog: You don’t have to answer every
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That she didn’t want to die?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: That’s what it sounded like. It
dialog: was hard to hear.
text: And then Julie sees something beyond the boys.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Is that her?
text: Dane and Lucas spin... in time to see the back of the little
text: girl as she walks down the basement steps.
text: Dane takes off after her, with Lucas and Julie right behind.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Hey, little girl!
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - DAY
text: The kids stampede down the steps... reach the bottom... just
dialog: in time to see...
text: ...the LITTLE GIRL CRAWLING ON HER STOMACH INTO THE HOLE...
text: HER LEGS DISAPPEARING just before the TRAP DOOR SLAMS SHUT.
dialog: 44,
text: Dane, Lucas and Julie can’t move... can barely remember to
dialog: breathe... just stare at that trap door.
text: Finally, they ease toward it... reach the trap door, exchange
text: a “should we” glance before Dane grabs the handle... pulls it
dialog: back open...
text: ...and there’s that DEEP, DARK, EMPTY HOLE.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Close it, Dane.
text: Dane just keeps gazing down into the black.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Hello?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dane... please.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: She’s gotta be down there.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Dane.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Close it!
text: Lucas tears the trap door loose from Dane’s grip... slams it
dialog: shut.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We all saw that, right?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: If you’re talking about the freaky
text: little girl that just crawled into
dialog: a bottomless pit under your
dialog: house... yeah.
text: Dane considers the sound of that... stares down at the trap
text: door, then looks to Lucas.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: What’d you do with the locks?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I left them right there.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Well they’re not here now.
dialog: 45.
text: They do a quick search... no luck.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Maybe she took them.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Why would she have taken locks?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: So we couldn’t keep her down there
dialog: anymore.
text: They exchange another creeped-out glance.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Or maybe it wasn’t her that took
dialog: them. Maybe it was the man last
dialog: night... or the clown.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Hang on. What man... what clown?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Nothin’.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What kinda hole is this?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - LATER
text: And Dane, Lucas and Julie sitting at the bottom of the steps,
text: their backs against the wall, staring at that hole. Lucas is
text: between Dane and Julie, wearing a CATCHER’S MASK and holding
text: Dane’s baseball bat. Dane has a paintball helmet on, with
text: the paintball gun across his lap, and Julie holds a KITCHEN
text: KNIFE in one hand and pointed MEAT THERMOMETER in the other.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It’s the gateway to hell. Like a
dialog: secret passage for dead people.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Why would that little girl be...
dialog: (thinking of a way to say
dialog: hell)
dialog: ...down there?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Did you check out those eyes?
text: Black... dripping blood. And she
text: did look completely dead.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It’s a gateway to hell.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dolls don’t go to...
text: Lucas mouths the word to Dane without actually saying it.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Maybe the guy that owned the doll
dialog: was like some puppet master serial
dialog: killer... he goes, the clown goes
dialog: too. Package deal.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Could be a wormhole.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Like a door between different
dialog: universes.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: It’s not a wormhole. And you need
dialog: to stop reading so much. You're
dialog: turnin’ into a little geek.
text: The O.S. DOORBELL RINGS upstairs. They all give a little
dialog: jump. Then...
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Pizza guy.
text: Dane shoves some bills into Lucas’ palm. Lucas throws them
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I’m not going up there.
text: Dane looks to Julie... she shakes her head. Dane rolls his
text: eyes... throws a glance up the stairs, then takes off, gun
text: ready to fire. Lucas and Julie keep their eyes locked on
text: that hole... until Lucas glances to the meat thermometer.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: I wonder what temperature that
text: little girl is. She looked cold.
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The PIZZA GUY stands at the front door. The door swings open,
text: and there’s Dane, in full paintball gear. The Pizza Guy just
text: looks him. Dane makes a quick exchange... cash for pizza.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Thanks, dude.
text: And just like that, the door swings shut in the Pizza Guy’s
text: face. He stands there a beat before walking back to his car.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Dane hurries back down the steps with the pizza.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Anything?
text: Lucas and Julie shake their heads... grab a slice each.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: When’s Mom get home?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Not till midnight.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: We should’ve called her.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: It would just freak her out. And
dialog: if she finds out about this, she'd
dialog: have us packed up tonight.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Okay with me. And that’s what you
dialog: want too.
text: Dane doesn’t answer... his eyes dart a quick glance to
text: Julie... he’s not so sure anymore.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Let’s figure out what we’ve got
dialog: before we tell her anything.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I know what you've got. You’ve got
dialog: a gateway to hell under your house.
dialog: (takes another bite)
dialog: And that’s really cool.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
text: The houses are all dark. The street is quiet. A breeze
text: whispers through the trees.
scene_heading: EXT. JULIE’S HOUSE/POOL - NIGHT
text: The wind blows an inflatable ball off the pool... it does the
text: lonely bounce over the yard... wedges against the fence
text: leading to the Payton house.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: ANGLE ON THE THREE KIDS... still armed to the teeth, but now
text: SOUND ASLEEP at the bottom of the steps. Dane’s slumped over
text: with Lucas leaning against him, and Julie’s head on Lucas’
dialog: shoulder.
text: A FIGURE’S SHADOW FLOATS OVER THEM... just hovers there,
text: until Lucas’ eyes blink open... he looks up... SCREAMS...
text: .--and the others fly up, wide awake, weapons ready. And in
text: a survival reflex, Dane SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER... POP...
text: ..-before any of them realize it’s SUSAN standing over
text: them... staring down, totally baffled. The ORANGE PAINTBALL
text: STAIN drips down from the ceiling beside her head.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I wouldn’t understand anyway,
dialog: right?
text: Dane and Lucas shake their heads. Susan throws a glance up
text: at the orange dot, then starts up the steps... never notices
text: the open hole across the room.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (cont'd)
dialog: Come up when you’re finished.
text: They wait for her to walk out the door, then...
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Whatta we do now?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (off the hole)
dialog: Lock it up for the night.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You lost the locks, remember?
dialog: 49.
text: Dane walks to the hole... pulls the trap door closed, then
text: glances around the basement until his eyes settle on the
text: RUSTY OLD CHEST FREEZER.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - LATER
text: And the kids pushing the massive box on top of the trap door.
dialog: And this thing must weigh a ton because they’re using every
text: ounce of strength they have to inch it across the floor until
text: it’s resting squarely on top of the trap door.
text: Julie hands Dane the knife and meat thermometer.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Don’t explore anymore without me.
text: Julie starts out the door... throws a glance back to Dane.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: This was fun.
text: Then she’s gone, and Dane’s left with Lucas staring at him,
text: lips puckered, making KISSING NOISES. Dane just shoves Lucas
dialog: away.
text: The boys walk up the steps, Lucas making sure he’s in front.
text: They reach the top of the stairs... CLICK... the basement
text: goes dark, except for the moonlight through the window,
text: making the old metal freezer almost glow.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING
text: Bright and sunny. Joggers and dog-walkers make their way
text: along the street and sidewalk.
text: Susan walks out of the house... climbs into her car, backing
text: out of the drive.
text: She pulls away, WAVING TO JULIE ON HER PORCH, as she leaves.
text: Julie watches for Susan to disappear around the corner, then
text: leaps off her porch... sprints across the yard.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Julie charges through the door... and there are Dane and
text: Lucas standing at the closed basement door, waiting for her.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I didn’t think she was ever leaving
dialog: for work.
text: They throw open the door... charge down.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - MORNING
text: Dane, Lucas and Julie stampede down the steps... reach the
dialog: bottom and freeze...
text: ...because the CHEST FREEZER IS STANDING ON ITS END AGAINST
text: THE WALL, like it was just tossed there... AND THE TRAP DOOR
scene_heading: SITS UNCOVERED.
text: They all just stare at it, until...
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Maybe Mom did it.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Like she could just roll that thing
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Maybe it was Satan tired of you
text: blocking his gateway to hell.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (nods )
dialog: I bet Satan’s strong.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (shakes his head)
text: So he moves an old freezer, but
dialog: can’t figure out how to get a few
dialog: locks off? I’d expect more skills
text: outta a guy with Lucifer’s rep.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Well somebody moved it.
text: Dane walks over to the freezer... gives it a shove... the
text: metal box just rocks a few inches, but enough that...
text: ...a CRUSHED BEER CAN tumbles off to the floor beside Dane’s
text: feet. Dane stares at the can a second, then reaches down...
text: picks up the can... sniffs the top.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: You guys have a party down here
dialog: last night?
dialog: 51.
text: Dane shakes his head.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I bet Satan drinks a lot too.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: You said the dude that used to live
dialog: here... that they took him to some
dialog: psycho place.
dialog: (off Julie’s nod)
dialog: Is he locked up?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Where do they keep him?
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: The old hospital west of town.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Let’s go see if we can ask him some
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (points to the trap door)
dialog: What about that?
text: They all stare at the trap door a beat, then...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - LATER
text: ANGLE OF THE TRAP DOOR... as Dane HAMMERS NAILS ALL AROUND
text: THE EDGES, sealing it shut. He gives the handle a tug...
text: doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Let’s see how Satan does with
dialog: nails.
scene_heading: EXT. BENSONVILLE MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY
dialog: Old is right... and in need of a paint job. A high barbed-
text: wire fence surrounds the grounds.
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: INT. BENSONVILLE MENTAL HOSPITAL/HALLWAY - DAY
text: Dane, Lucas and Julie walk down the hall to the NURSE’S DESK.
text: An OLD NURSE greets them with a big smile.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Hey kids, what can I do for you?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We'd like to talk to...
text: And then Dane realizes he doesn’t know who it is they want to
text: talk to... he throws a panicked glance to Julie.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Ethan Franklin.
text: The nurse’s smile fades.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Ethan?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: If it’s okay. He was my
dialog: neighbor... we were friends.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I didn’t know that he... I mean, I
dialog: believe you might be the first
dialog: visitors Ethan’s had here.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Is he allowed to see people?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Of course. Ethan’s a voluntary.
dialog: He can see who he pleases... come
dialog: and go as he likes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He just likes to stay here.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I think he just feels safer.
dialog: (to Julie)
dialog: And what was your name, dear?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Julie Campbell.
text: The nurse points to the VISITORS AREA... tables, chairs, a
text: television. A few people mingle in the room.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I‘ll bring Ethan over to you.
text: The nurse walks down the hall. Dane, Lucas and Julie walk to
text: a table... squeeze into the chairs on one side.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What do we say when he gets here?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We ask him about the hole.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Just like that?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Let’s ask him if it’s a worm hole
dialog: to another universe.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: You know what, just don’t talk. We
dialog: don’t want the freak to think he’s
dialog: trapped inside some kindergarten
dialog: Star Wars convention.
text: They see the nurse step out of a room, leading ETHAN
text: FRANKLIN, (50's), t-shirt and sweat pants hanging on his bone-
text: thin frame... long, gray-streaked hair falling over his gaunt
text: face. His fingers twitch in non-stop motion against the
text: sides of his legs.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: This guy’s not gonna try to eat our
dialog: livers or anything is he?
text: Lucas’ eyes widen... eat what?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: How should I know? All I ever did
text: was stare at him from across the
dialog: fence.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Hope he doesn’t remember that part.
text: Ethan hasn’t looked up... head tilted to one side, eyes
text: locked on his own BARE FEET. And now Dane is staring at them
text: too, as the nurse guides Ethan to the table.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Here’s your friend Julie, Ethan.
dialog: Do you remember her?
text: Ethan doesn’t answer... just keeps staring at those feet.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: NURSE (cont’d)
dialog: (to Julie)
dialog: He hasn’t talked much since he’s
dialog: been here.
text: The Nurse eases Ethan into the chair across from them.
speaker_heading: NURSE (cont’d)
dialog: But good luck. And just let me
dialog: know if you need anything.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Thank you.
text: The nurse walks away. The kids all just stare at Ethan...
text: his knee trembling wildly. Dane gives Julie an elbow.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: Hi, Mr. Franklin. I’m Julie
dialog: Campbell... I used to live beside
dialog: you.
text: Ethan doesn’t react... just keeps twitching and trembling.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (whispers to Julie)
dialog: Did he always look like this?
text: Julie shakes her head.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: We're sorry to bother you, but we
dialog: wanted to ask you about your old
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: My brother and I live in it now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We found that trapdoor... in the
dialog: basement.
text: Suddenly Ethan’s body goes completely still. The kids
text: exchange glances... they just made a connection.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: We're trying to find out where it
dialog: leads.
text: Ethan doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: Mr. Franklin?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We just want to...
speaker_heading: ETHAN
text: The darkness.
text: Now the kids are as still as Ethan. Then...
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: What does that mean? Is it hell?
dialog: Is that where the hole leads?
text: Suddenly Ethan’s head flies up... hand shoots out, grabbing
text: Dane by the arm. Ethan’s eyes burn into Dane's.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: You didn’t take the locks off?
text: And now it’s Dane’s turn to be unable to speak.
speaker_heading: ETHAN (cont'd)
dialog: (deathly serious)

text: object off his leg.
speaker_heading: ETHAN (cont'd)
dialog: Why would you do that?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We didn’t know.
text: Ethan stands... starts backing away from them... back to the
text: safety of his own room. His eyes dart around, searching for
dialog: something the rest of us can’t see.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: The darkness knows you.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Knows us? I don’t understand. Did
dialog: you make it... did you make the
dialog: hole?
text: Ethan just stares at them... shakes his head.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: It’s been there since the world’s

text: And then Ethan turns... the kids just watch him twitch his

speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: He doesn’t like that hole.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: And it doesn’t sound like he made
dialog: it either.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: So we need to find out who did.

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: No way, really? Are you sure?
text: Then Dane notices something... TWO GREASE-COVERED WORK BOOTS
text: sitting outside the closet. He stares at them a beat, then
text: walks over... picks one up... looks it over, then...
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (to Lucas)
dialog: Did you put these here.
text: Lucas glances up from the game... shakes his head. Dane
text: looks back to the boot... the FOOTPRINT STAIN on the floor.

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)

speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)

text: Julie releases Lucas’ ears, just as...
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Killed herself?
text: Now Lucas heard... MOANS.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (off Lucas, to Dane)
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: When was this?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Like before I was born. And then a
dialog: couple different families moved in,
dialog: but my Dad said they only stayed
dialog: for a couple weeks... he never
dialog: really met them. I think he said
text: they both ran off in the middle of
dialog: the night... left all their stuff
dialog: in here. Never came back for it.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: So none of them made that hole.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
text: The world’s first scream.

speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: What kinda meeting?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: The mother kind.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Why can’t we come?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Because it’s one of those grown-up
dialog: things, and it’1ll be boring, and
dialog: you'll have more fun here. And I
dialog: need somebody to keep an eye on the

speaker_heading: LUCAS

speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: You're not scared?
text: Dane notices something on the floor... the SQUARE WINDOW OF
text: LIGHT where the moon shines through the window. But the

speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: What are you doin’?
text: Dane doesn’t answer... just waves his hand past the window,
text: and watching his shadow on the floor... of the hand passing
text: over the bars.
dialog: 60.
text: Dane squints out the window... can’t find what’s causing the
text: lines. Finally, he just pulls the curtains closed... the

speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: So you’re not scared?
speaker_heading: DANE

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: My Dad was talking to somebody from

dialog: doctors think it was a heart
dialog: attack.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Then it didn’t have anything to do
dialog: with the hole. I mean it’s nailed

speaker_heading: NURSE

speaker_heading: DANE

speaker_heading: NURSE

speaker_heading: LUCAS

speaker_heading: NURSE (cont’d)
dialog: I wasn’t here when they found him,

speaker_heading: NURSE (cont’d)

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: He was deathly afraid of snakes.
dialog: The rare days we could get him
dialog: outside, he’d put those on with

speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Did he ever say anything about the
dialog: darkness?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Sometimes... if he’d get upset.
dialog: For the first few months he was

scene_heading: EXT. BENSONVILLE MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DANE
text: Scared to death.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She said they found him just

text: WHISTLING IS GONE...
text: .-+-and the kitchen is empty...
text: ...except for a GREASE-STAINED MECHANIC’S SHIRT thrown over
text: one of the chairs.
text: And Dane’s confused... frightened... like he’s just seen a
text: ghost, but it’s only a dirty shirt.
text: Dane spins... charges out of the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dane sprints across the room... up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/DANE’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dane runs into the room... flips on the light... and there’s
text: Lucas still asleep on the floor. Dane throws a glance around
text: the room, then turns the light back off.
text: He steps inside... closes the door, and climbs up into his
text: bed... but not to sleep... it’s like a guard keeping watch.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Quiet and dark.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dim moonlight glows over Ethan’s scattered pages.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: The trap door still swung open, exposing the hole.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
text: LOW ANGLE ON THE FLOOR...
text: .+.-as TWO DIRTY BARE FEET step into frame... move down the
dialog: hall.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/DANE’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: ANGLE ON LUCAS...
text: ...-sleeping on the floor... as a SHADOW MOVES OVER HIM. And
text: Lucas must have sensed the presence because his eyes fly
text: open... he starts to cry out, then sees it’s Dane standing
text: above him, his finger to his lips.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (whispers)
text: Someone’s in the house.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
text: Dane and Lucas step into Dane’s doorway.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Stay here.
text: Dane has the baseball bat again... moving into Lucas’ room.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LUCAS’ ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Dane flips on the light... glances around... empty.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
text: And Lucas staring anxiously toward his room. But then a
text: BURST OF LIGHT FROM DOWNSTAIRS... someone just turned on the
dialog: lights.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Dane. Dane.
text: But Dane doesn’t hear him. So Lucas eases to the stairs...
text: peers over the rail to see who’s down there. But his view’s
text: blocked, so he has to creep down a few steps...
text: ..-and spots a YOUNG COP standing in the center of the living
text: room, LOOKING RIGHT BACK UP AT LUCAS.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: Hey, son. What’s your name?
text: Lucas is afraid to answer... afraid to move. He throws
text: another glance down the hall for Dane... not there, so he
text: looks back to the cop.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Lucas.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: Are you the one that called, Lucas?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: My brother, I think. He said
dialog: someone was in the house.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: Did your brother say who it was?
text: Lucas shakes his head. The cop throws another glance around
text: the room, then pulls a Polaroid from his pocket... starts up
text: the stairs to Lucas.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP (cont'd)
dialog: I’ve been looking for this person
dialog: right here.
text: The young cop reaches Lucas... hands Lucas the photo. Lucas
text: looks at it, and fear washes over his face.
text: ANGLE ON THE POLAROID...
text: ...of TWO LITTLE GIRLS... one of them the LITTLE GIRL IN THE
scene_heading: PINK DRESS.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP (cont'd)
dialog: That one on the right.
text: The cop turns to go back down the stairs, and that’s when
text: Lucas sees the BLOODY, GAPING WOUND IN THE COP’S BACK... HE
dialog: SHOULD BE DEAD... might be dead.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP (cont'd)
dialog: Do you think that’s who your
dialog: brother saw?
text: Lucas doesn’t answer... can’t answer... just watches the cop
text: walk back down the stairs... around the corner. Dane appears
text: behind Lucas.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I told you to stay in the room.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: He’s down there.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: He gave me this.
text: Lucas holds the Polaroid out to Dane with a trembling hand.
text: Dane stares at the picture, then moves down the stairs...
text: leans around... sees the YOUNG COP WALK INTO THE BASEMENT.
text: Dane follows after him... and Lucas is too afraid to stay up
text: there by himself, so he rushes behind Dane...
text: ...and never sees the DARK FIGURE OF A MAN STANDING DOWN THE
text: HALL BEHIND HIM.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Dane and Lucas move slowly down the steps... bend down to
text: peer through the railing... to watch the young cop crawl into
text: the hole, disappear head first, just like the little girl.
text: The trap door slams shut behind him.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: You said the nails would keep it
dialog: closed. You said they couldn’t
dialog: come up anymore.
text: Dane stares at all the loose nails scattered around the hole.
text: Then he looks back to the photograph... the two little girls.
dialog: 79.
text: ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH...
text: .--and the other little girl... strangely familiar.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Oh, shit.
text: He grabs Lucas’ arm.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: C'mon.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JULIE’S HOUSE/JULIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Julie’s asleep in bed... stirs... rolls over...
text: .--and there’s the LITTLE GIRL standing beside her... those
text: red tears slipping down her cheeks.
text: Julie jumps back with a start... looks like she’s seen a
text: ghost. She presses herself back against the wall.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: I missed you, Julie.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let’s play. Just like we used to.
text: Julie tries to scream... can’t make her mouth work.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Da... daddy.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Don’t let him hear you. He’1l make
dialog: us go to bed.
text: The Little Girl squats down on the floor... starts playing
text: with the jacks.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL (cont'd)
dialog: Why didn’t you help me?
text: Then an 0.S. TAPPING. Julie’s eyes dart to her window... and
text: Dane knocking against it... motioning her over.
text: Julie looks back to the Little Girl... crawls down off the
text: end of her bed... backs her way to the window, as the Little
text: Girl bounces the ball... scoops the jacks.
dialog: 80.
text: Julie reaches the window... shakily flips the lock... throws
text: it open, as the Little Girl sees her escaping.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL (cont'd)
dialog: Don’t go, Julie.
text: The Little Girl rises... starts walking after Julie. And
text: Julie’s crying, as she scrambles out the window, with Dane
text: pulling her.
scene_heading: EXT. JULIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Julie hits the ground beside Dane and Lucas... they race
text: away, as the Little Girl stands at the window, watching
dialog: them...
text: .»+.a red tear hitting the windowsill with a SPLAT.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dane, Lucas and Julie charge through the back door... lock it
text: behind them. Julie falls against Dane, sobbing.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Who is she?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: She can’t be real... she can’t be
dialog: real.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Julie. Who is she?
text: Julie tries to calm down... to focus.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Annie Binning. We used to play
dialog: together every day when we were
dialog: little. But then...
text: Julie can’t finish.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Then?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: She disappeared. Someone took
dialog: her... a man.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We were outside... and this man...
text: he pulled up in a truck.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
text: He was dressed like a policeman,
dialog: but I knew he wasn’t one... I'd
dialog: seen him other days taking pictures
dialog: of us. But this time he got out
text: and started talking to Annie. Then
dialog: he took Annie’s hand...
dialog: (crying)
dialog: ..-he took her hand and led her
dialog: back to his truck. And I knew
dialog: something bad was happening, and I
dialog: wanted to yell, but I was so
dialog: scared. I wanted to help her but I
dialog: couldn't.
text: Dane holds her tighter.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: It’s okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They found him, didn’t they? They
text: found the man, and they shot him,
dialog: right?
text: Julie nods, then...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: How'd you know?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (glances at Lucas)
dialog: Just guessed. But I think I know
dialog: why she’s here... why she came
dialog: back.
dialog: (off Julie’s look)
dialog: Because you were so scared.
text: Dane points to Ethan’s hole image on the floor.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: I think inside the hole is whatever
dialog: we're afraid of. That’s what Ethan
dialog: meant by The Darkness... dark
dialog: thoughts... fears. Remember, he
dialog: said it knows you. I think he
dialog: meant it knows what we’re scared
dialog: of.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I don’t know. But it makes our
dialog: fears real... brings them to life.
dialog: For Ethan it was snakes.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont'd)
dialog: For Lucas it’s clowns. For you...
dialog: it’s what happened to your friend.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I’m not scared of anything. But I
dialog: still want to find some locks to
dialog: put on that trap door.
scene_heading: INT. JULIE’S GARAGE - NIGHT
text: The kids dig through shelves and tool chests.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Got ‘em.
text: Julie holds up a FEW PADLOCKS WITH THE KEYS STILL IN THEM.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: And we need one more thing.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Dane and Lucas stand against the wall. Julie kneels beside
text: the hole, looking scared out of her mind.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I don’t want to do this.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: It’s the only way.
text: And then we see what Julie’s so scared about... the Little
text: Girl’s feet appear on the basement steps... make their way
text: slowly down.
text: Julie’s trembling, as she watches the Little Girl reach the
text: bottom... start walking toward her.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oh, God.
text: The Little Girl moves closer... closer... and Julie wants to
text: run, but she doesn’t... she just stares back at her fear.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Do you want to play with me?
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Some other time, okay, Annie?
text: The Little Girl nods... reaches out her hand, and strokes
text: Julie’s hair. Julie closes her eyes... quivers at the touch.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: You got bigger, Julie.
text: And then Julie opens her eyes... tears well up in them.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I know. I’m sorry.
text: Then Julie takes the Little Girl’s hand... holds it. Doesn’t
text: seem scared anymore.
text: Then the Little Girl turns, and crawls headfirst back into
text: the hole... disappears.
text: And as soon as she does, Dane and Lucas leap over... slam the
text: trap door closed.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: The locks!
text: Dane looks back to the locks still over on the floor. He
text: darts back for them...
text: ++.just as the TRAP DOOR BURSTS BACK OPEN, AND THE CLOWN
scene_heading: MARIONETTE STRETCHES OUT... GRABS LUCAS’ ARM.
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
speaker_heading: DANE!
text: The doll jerks Lucas toward the hole, but Julie grabs
text: Lucas... holds him back, as the Marionette claws and tugs at
text: Lucas... its little bells JINGLING AWAY.
text: Dane punches the doll away... it vanishes in the black, then
text: WHAM... slams the trap door back down. The kids frantically
text: snap the locks shut. There’s that 0O.S. CLAWING from under
text: the door, but it finally stops... everything calms... just
text: the kids’ heavy breathing, as they stare at that closed trap
dialog: door. Then...
speaker_heading: LUCAS (cont'd)
dialog: (to Dane)
dialog: Told you it was real.
text: Dane nods... he believes.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I know everything’s cool now and
dialog: all, but... do you guys want to
dialog: stay at my house tonight?
text: Lucas nods wildly to Dane.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Yeah, okay.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dane sits on the couch, staring blankly. Julie’s beside him.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Dane snaps out of his zone... nods his head.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: It’s over, right? Nothing to worry
dialog: about?
text: Dane nods... right.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Lucas, let’s go!
speaker_heading: LUCAS (0.S.)
dialog: I’m getting my stuff!
text: Julie notices the notepad pages scattered on the floor.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Are those Ethan’s pages?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Yeah. I don’t know what it’s
dialog: supposed to be.
text: Julie walks over... takes a page... finds a place for it,
text: then moves another... the dark edges seem to fit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LUCAS’ ROOM - NIGHT
text: Lucas sitting on the floor, putting his shoes on. And then a
text: TAPPING AT HIS WINDOW.
text: Lucas looks over to the window... nothing there.
dialog: 85.
text: He goes back to his shoes... MORE TAPPING... his head snaps
text: up... still, the window’s empty.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dane and Julie working together on the puzzle.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Right there.
text: Dane slides a page in... Julie places another beside it...
text: the image is growing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LUCAS’ ROOM - NIGHT
text: Lucas stares at the window another beat, then starts crawling
text: over, keeping his head below the window... out of sight. He
text: reaches it, then slowly raises up to see outside.
text: Nothing but his own reflection.
text: And then Lucas notices something beyond his face...
text: ...the REFLECTION OF A MONSTROUS MAN STANDING IN THE DOORWAY
scene_heading: BEHIND HIM.
text: Lucas spins... but there’s no man there. Lucas turns back to
text: the window... sees just his reflection again... NO MAN.
text: So Lucas turns to walk out, and steps RIGHT INTO THE MAN...
text: huge... long greasy hair... hard face... deep, dark eyes.
dialog: More monster than man.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Hello, boy.
text: Lucas starts to scream, but the man throws a thick hand over
text: his mouth, muffling Lucas’ cries.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A SMALL SQUARE OF CARPET with black on all sides... until
text: Julie’s hand gently lays another page in the square...
text: filling it in with black...
dialog: 86.
text: ...and we pull back... but don’t reach the edges of the
dialog: image, because it’s much bigger than we last saw... covering
text: most of the floor... with Dane and Julie standing over it...
text: ...staring down at those sketched designs now pieced
text: together. It’s not completely finished, but it’s clear what
text: the image is... A PICTURE OF THE HOLE... WITH A MAN HOLDING A
text: BOY’S HAND... LEADING HIM DOWN INTO THE BLACKNESS.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Oh, God.
text: Dane takes off... charges up the stairs.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Lucas!
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/LUCAS’ ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dane rushes into the room... no Lucas.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Lucas!
text: Then he sees the GREASY FOOTPRINTS on the floor... leading
text: back out of the room.
text: Dane steps out... sees that the footprints leave a trail all
text: the way down the hall. Julie appears up the stairs.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What’s the matter? Where’s Lucas?
text: Dane takes off down the past Julie.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: My father’s got him.
scene_heading: INT. PAYTON HOUSE/BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Dane comes barreling down the steps.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Lucas!
text: And there’s that trap door OPEN WIDE... the new locks resting
text: on the floor beside it.
text: Julie races down after Dane.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What’s going on?
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I brought him here. My father.
dialog: And now he took Lucas down there.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What? No... there is no down
dialog: there. There’s no bottom,
dialog: remember?
dialog: 
text: But Dane isn’t listening to her... he’s grabbing a rope...
text: tying it around a pipe on the wall, then wrapping it around
text: his own waist.
speaker_heading: JULIE (cont'd)
dialog: Dane, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I have to get Lucas.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Wait. You can’t go in that thing.
dialog: You don’t even know he’s down
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Yes I do.
text: Then Dane steps into that shimmering darkness... WHOOSH... he
text: vanishes into the black... the rope uncoils... stretches out,
text: then SNAPS TAUT, bending the pipe.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Dane!
text: But Dane’s long gone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: BLACK...
dialog: .-..end of the universe kind of dark. And it’s completely
text: silent except for Dane’s nervous breaths.
text: We hear some movement, then a LIGHT FLASHES ON...
text: ..-and we see Dane’s standing inside a closet, his hand still
text: on a light switch. The rope is still tied around his
text: waist... stretches up to a BLACK HOLE HIGH ABOVE HIM.
text: The closet’s filled with a little boy’s clothes and toys.
text: Dane glances around, unties the rope, then his eyes settle on
text: the closet doorknob... he turns it... pushes the door open...
dialog: 88.
text: .--inching it wide to reveal a LONG, DARK, NARROW CORRIDOR,
text: stretching out in front of him... no real light except for a
text: DIM SQUARE at the far end of the hall.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Dane moves through the doorway... just a few steps. And in
text: what little light there is, we can begin to make out the
dialog: details of the corridor...
text: -..Stone floor... rock walls... and lines of PRISON CELLS ON
text: EACH SIDE for the length of the passage. Dane looks to the
text: cells beside him... beyond the rusty bars... empty... just a
text: cot in a square room of stone.
text: Dane begins walking down the corridor... toward the light at
text: the far end. And the passage seems to stretch forever...
text: like the end is a football field away.
text: Dane throws nervous glances into each cell as he passes...
text: picking up speed toward the far end... nearing it, and
dialog: slowing...
text: ..-because he can make out where the light is coming from...
text: ANOTHER PRISON CELL... this one glowing with a small lamp...
text: and there’s a Man sitting slumped over on the cot... his
text: long, greasy hair hangs down almost to the floor.
dialog: And we all know who the Man is... so does Dane... that’s why
text: he stops outside the cell door... just stares at him...
text: watches as the Man slowly raises his head... rolls those
text: black eyes up toward Dane... and smiles.
text: Dane takes an instinctive step back... but then sees the
text: SHACKLES around the Man’s hands and feet. That gives him the
dialog: courage to...
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (soft, frightened)
dialog: Where’s Lucas?
text: Suddenly the CLANK of a cell door unlocking behind Dane.
text: Dane spins... sees one of the cell doors swinging open.
text: Dane looks at the smiling Man, then begins backing down the
text: hall... nearing the open cell while keeping his eyes on the
dialog: Man.
text: Finally Dane reaches the open door... looks inside...
text: .--but it isn’t a prison cell anymore... it’s Lucas’ room at
dialog: their house...
dialog: 89.
text: .+..and LUCAS IS CLIMBING OUT THE WINDOW.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Lucas!
text: Lucas doesn’t slow. Dane charges into the room after him...
text: reaches the window and looks out... to their yard below...
text: .--and Lucas racing across the yard.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: LUCAS! WAIT!
text: Dane crawls out after him.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT
text: Dane scrambles out... starts to jump, then sees that there’s
text: NO GROUND BENEATH HIM... just endless darkness.
text: Dane clings to the edge of the window.
speaker_heading: DANE
speaker_heading: LUCAS!
dialog: But Lucas is gone... or was never there.
text: Dane climbs back inside.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT
text: Dane falls back through the window... sees that Lucas’ room
text: is now just an empty prison cell... same rock floor... stone
dialog: walls.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Dane steps out of the cell... looks back down to where the
dialog: Man was sitting...
text: ..-but now the COT IS EMPTY... the shackles rest free on the
text: floor... the Man is gone.
text: The cell door CLANKS... CREAKS as it drifts open. And then
text: the next cell door swings open... then the one across the
dialog: hall from that... then the next... and the next...
text: .»+-each door violently crashing open... moving down the row
dialog: toward Dane... and each one faster than the one before...
text: he’s coming for Dane.
dialog: 90.
text: Dane spins... takes off down the corridor... the cell doors
text: flying open behind him... gaining on him... and it’s a race
text: to that WHITE CLOSET DOOR at the end of the passage.
text: And it’s like the doors are being blown off their rusty
text: hinges, as they tear wide... crash into the walls... almost
dialog: even with Dane as he...
text: ...reaches the closet door... charges through.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dane slams the door shut... presses himself against it...
text: ready for the attack from the other side... but it never
text: comes. He spots an OLD KEY hanging on the wall beside the
text: door... he grabs it... LOCKS THE DOOR.
text: Dane steps away from the door... turns... sees he’s ina
text: large, vacant room... four walls and a floor... and another
text: door on the opposite wall.
text: He hurries to the door... locked. He’s still got the key...
text: slides it into the handle... turns...
text: ...AND THE UNLOCKING CLICK COMES FROM BEHIND DANE.
text: Dane looks back... the other door’s still closed. He turns
text: his door handle... a SQUEAK from the other door.
text: Dane glances back again... stares at the door as he turns the
dialog: knob...
text: .+-and watches the other handle rotate by itself.
text: Dane inches his door open...
text: ...the other door widens as well.
text: Then BAM... something hits Dane’s door from the other side.
text: He shoves it back closed... presses his back against it...
text: .--and watches as the opposite door shakes back and forth
dialog: exactly as his.
text: And Dane’s losing his battle... his door’s widening... so is
dialog: the other...
text: .--and finally Dane just takes off... lets his door swing
dialog: open...
text: .--and when the opposite door opens wide, he sprints through.
dialog: gl.
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Dane suddenly slams to the floor with a GASP. He looks above
text: him... there is no ceiling... just darkness... with a DARKER,
text: BLACK HOLE shimmering in the middle of it.
text: Dane stands... eases across the room. RAIN and TRAFFIC NOISE
text: beat against the windows... it feels just like we’re in
dialog: Queens.
text: A PAIR OF GREASY BOOTS rests beside the back door... a
text: MECHANIC’S SHIRT lays over the chair.
text: FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS hang on the refrigerator door. We hold on
text: one of A YOUNG BOY AND BABY BROTHER, (Dane and Lucas).
text: This is Dane’s old house... where all of Dane’s fears began.
text: Suddenly the end of the rope falls through the black hole...
text: drops down beside Dane... just hangs there...
text: ..-with a NOTE tied around the end... “RUN AWAY BOY”
text: Dane looks to the doorway... knows what waits for him on the
text: other side. He looks back up to the hole... his escape. But
text: then he tears the note off... crumples it, and tosses it
text: away... walks toward the doorway.
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dane steps through the doorway... into the empty room... just
text: a tray of half-eaten food and beer cans sitting in front of
text: the television, as a YANKEES GAME plays onscreen.
text: Dane creeps through the room, his eyes searching for Lucas.
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: A room for two boys. A twin bed on one side and crib on the
dialog: other... each with matching baseball blankets... one National
text: League, the other American. Sports posters line the walls...
text: another photograph of the YOUNG DANE in his baseball uniform,
text: with BABY LUCAS sitting in his lap.
text: Dane moves straight for the closet... opens the door, and the
text: closet is filled with clothes, toys and junk of a little
dialog: boy... this is just like the closet where Dane arrived when
text: he jumped into the hole.
text: And then Lucas steps out from behind the clothes.
dialog: 92.
text: They see each other... wrap their arms around the other.
text: Dane holds Lucas tight... probably like he hasn’t hugged him
dialog: in years.
text: Dane closes the door behind him, sealing the two boys inside
dialog: together.
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/CLOSET - CONTINUOUS
text: Dane and Lucas slide down to the floor together.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: How'd you know where I was?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Because this is where I always used
dialog: to hide when I was scared.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: You did?
dialog: (off Dane’s nod)
dialog: I thought you said you weren't
dialog: scared of anything.
dialog: A beat, then...
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I lied.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: You’re scared of him?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: (nods )
dialog: And it’s my fault he brought you
dialog: here. He’s my fear, not yours.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Then you shouldn’t have come down.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I had to. What would I do up there
dialog: without you?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: What you always do. Play with the

dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont'd)
dialog: that’s the thing with brothers...
dialog: (beat, thinking)
dialog: ...they’re like old closets.
dialog: ‘Cause no matter how many new
dialog: friends you make or new places you
dialog: go... there’s only one place where
dialog: you really feel good and safe.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And sometimes you just gotta get
dialog: scared enough to remember that.
text: Lucas considers all this a moment, then...
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: But you still shouldn’t have come.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Because that’s what he wanted. He
dialog: said he only took me so he could
dialog: get you down here.
text: Suddenly a HAND REACHES OUT FROM THE CLOTHES BEHIND LUCAS...
text: .--jerks him backward.
speaker_heading: DANE
speaker_heading: LUCAS!
text: Dane grabs for Lucas... misses... Lucas is gone.
text: Dane pushes through the clothes after him. And the closet
text: seems to go on forever... LUCAS’ CRIES leading Dane through
dialog: this endless dark passage...
text: .+-until Dane finally SLAMS INTO THE BACK WALL... and there
dialog: is no Lucas.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: (pounding the wall)
speaker_heading: LUCAS!
text: Dane spins... races back toward the closet door... reaches
text: it... throws it open.
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: The closet door swings open, and Dane charges out... freezes,
dialog: because this isn’t where he should be.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: BOY'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t tell him where we are.
text: Dane turns to the voice... the SHOWER CURTAIN PULLED ACROSS
scene_heading: THE OLD TUB.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Lucas.
text: Dane pulls the shower curtain open...
text: .+-and there’s the YOUNG DANE, crouched in the tub, holding
text: the BABY LUCAS in his arms.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DANE
dialog: Please.
text: Dane just stares at his younger self.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: You don’t have to be scared of him.
dialog: He can’t hurt you anymore.
text: THEN A BANGING ON THE DOOR BEHIND DANE...
text: .--he spins to it.
speaker_heading: FATHER’S VOICE (0.S.)
text: I TOLD YOU TO OPEN THIS DOOR, BOY!
speaker_heading: SUSAN (0.S.)
dialog: Leave them alone!
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Mom!
text: Dane throws open the door... rushes into the darkness...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: .»+-and Dane comes tumbling out of the black hole in the
text: kitchen... SLAMS TO THE FLOOR...
text: .--he’s right back where he started.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: No!
text: Dane scrambles toward the living room door.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Lucas!
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Dane charges through the door... into the living room...
text: slides to a stop... because there’s the Man... DANE’S
text: FATHER... sitting on the couch... his arm DRAPED OVER LUCAS’
scene_heading: SHOULDERS.
text: Tears slip down Lucas’ cheeks.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Let him go.
text: Dane’s Father just holds Lucas tighter.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: You aren’t real.
text: Their Father rises to his bare feet... and not only does he
dialog: look very real, he’s huge... must be close to seven feet
text: tall. He rests a hand on Lucas’ head, and it’s nearly twice
text: the size of Lucas’ skull. And there’s a GIANT GOLD RING on
text: one of his MASSIVE FINGERS.
dialog: And Lucas is scared... and so is Dane... and so are we.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: You aren’t really here. You're
dialog: still locked up. You can’t get to
dialog: us.
text: The Father gives Dane a frightening little smile... like he
dialog: knows something Dane doesn’t.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: C’mon, Lucas. He can’t hurt us
dialog: anymore.
text: Lucas is afraid to move.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Now, Lucas.
text: Lucas starts easing out from under the massive hand. And
text: we're expecting it to suddenly clamp down... grab a fistful
text: of hair... but it doesn’t... it lets Lucas go.
text: Lucas takes off to Dane... wraps his arms around his waist.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: It’s okay. We’re going home now.
dialog: 96.
text: Dane takes Lucas’ hand... they back their way toward the
text: kitchen door, with their Father just watching them escape.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: And don’t try to come after me
dialog: again. You’re just wasting your
dialog: time.
text: Dane reaches the door... pushes against it... but it doesn’t
text: move. He looks back... sees the SIX DEADBOLT LOCKS SECURING
speaker_heading: IT SHUT.
text: Their Father grins that evil grin of his... holds up a SET OF
speaker_heading: KEYS.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: They can keep things out... or keep
dialog: things in.
text: Dane shoves Lucas toward the hall.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Go!
text: Lucas takes off with Dane right behind him. Their Father
text: just LAUGHS at them as they run past.
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT
text: An old washer and dryer with a row of cabinets beside them.
text: Dane and Lucas duck into the room... lock the door.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: He’s gonna get us.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: No he’s not.
text: Dane throws open one of the cabinets... pulls Lucas down
text: toward it.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: He didn’t know about this one.
text: Dane pushes Lucas inside the cabinet... follows after him, as
text: their FATHER BEATS HIS FISTS AGAINST THE DOOR.
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/CABINET - NIGHT
text: Tight, dark and claustrophobic... Lucas and Dane squeezing
text: their way down the tiny passage.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I can’t make it.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Yes you can. Keep going.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: It’s too small.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Don’t stop, Lucas.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT
text: And the door flying open... their father fills the doorway...
text: can barely squeeze through. He crouches down... sees the
text: opening through the back of the cabinet.
speaker_heading: FATHER
speaker_heading: DANE!
text: And he’s way too big, so he spins... charges back out of the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. QUEENS BROWNSTONE/KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: One of the kitchen cabinets swings open, and out crawls
text: Lucas, with Dane right behind.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Get to the rope!
text: Then the BANGING of their Father working the locks on the
text: other side of the door.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Hurry, Lucas!
text: Dane lifts Lucas... gives him a head start up that rope.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: Get to the hole!
text: Dane throws a frightened glance to the door as it SHAKES...
text: those locks are coming off. Dane pulls the kitchen table
text: over against the door, then runs back to Lucas... starts
text: shoving him up.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: You gotta go faster!
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I’m trying!
text: Dane plants his hand on Lucas’ butt, shoving him up the
text: rope... starts up beneath him...
text: .+.jJust as the DOOR STARTS SWINGING IN AGAINST THE TABLE.
text: Lucas strains with each pull... slowly rising.
text: Their Father leans his head through the crack of the door...
text: sees them making their escape. He BANGS HIS SHOULDER AGAINST
text: THE DOOR... shoving the table out of the way...
dialog: .--he’s getting in.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I need you to go faster, Lucas.
dialog: Please go faster.
text: Lucas is trying... sweating each tug on the rope... squirming
text: upward toward that hole.
text: And Dane’s just beneath him, as their Father scrambles over
text: the table... gets to the rope, and starts swinging it...
text: trying to shake the boys down.
text: But the boys keep climbing, so he starts up after them...
text: taking big long pulls... gaining fast...
dialog: ...the boys are never going to make it...
text: .»+.-SO Dane RELEASES THE ROPE... drops straight down into
text: their Father... sending them both crashing to the kitchen
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dane!
text: Their Father jumps up... starts up the rope after Lucas.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Go! I’1l be right behind you!
text: Lucas can’t make himself rise into the hole just above his
text: head. Their Father continues up after him... until Dane
text: grabs his leg... holds him back.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: GO, LUCAS!
text: Lucas climbs higher... his head disappears into the hole...
text: then his body... finally he’s gone.
dialog: 99.
text: And Dane’s Father releases the rope... drops down to the
text: floor with a THUNDEROUS BANG... like a giant has just dropped
text: from the sky.
text: Dane backs up against the refrigerator. His Father walks
text: toward him, and Dane closes his eyes... turns away from his
dialog: Father... just the way he used to when he was little.
text: The Father eases up behind Dane... towers over him. And
dialog: then...
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I’m not scared of you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m not scared of you.
text: The Father cocks his oversized head. Dane pulls something
text: down from the refrigerator... stares at it, then turns to
text: face his Father... forces himself to stare up into those
text: black eyes.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: I’m not scared of you.
text: And then Dane’s Father ROARS... this cry that shakes the
text: room... the cry of Dane’s childhood.
speaker_heading: FATHER
speaker_heading: DANE!
text: Dane flinches at the scream... wants to run... would have run
text: before... but not this time. Instead, he just looks down to
text: the PHOTOGRAPH from the refrigerator.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: You aren’t this big. You only
dialog: looked like it because I was
dialog: little.
text: ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH...
text: ++. a YOUNG DANE posing with HIS REAL FATHER... a VERY
scene_heading: AVERAGE-LOOKING MAN.
speaker_heading: DANE (V.O.) (cont'd)
dialog: That’s why you always came after
dialog: us. Because you were mean... but
dialog: you were scared of everyone else.
text: Dane looks up from the picture...
text: .--and the giant monster of a man is gone... replaced by the
text: FATHER FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH... average... slight...
dialog: 100.
dialog: smaller than Dane even... nothing like the monster Dane’s
dialog: fears had created... except for those same mean eyes...
text: ..-but now they’re filled with fear... like he’s the one in
text: this room that’s suddenly scared.
text: And Dane smiles... and at the same time, tears fill his
text: eyes... because he’s suddenly been set free.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: You were the one that was weak and
dialog: afraid. And now I know that.
text: Dane turns his back on his Father... walks to the rope.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: I would tell you to stay away from
dialog: Lucas, but there’s no reason.
text: Dane looks back... the kitchen’s empty... his Father's
text: gone... his fear is gone.
speaker_heading: DANE (cont’d)
dialog: You don’t exist.
text: Then Dane starts climbing up the rope.
scene_heading: INT. WILSON HOUSE/BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Lucas and Julie kneel beside the hole... see Dane rising from
dialog: the black.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Dane!
text: They help him crawl out. Julie slams the trap door shut,
text: attaches one of the locks, while Lucas works the other...
text: seals the trap door shut.
text: As soon as Lucas is finished, he hugs Dane... hard.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Nice climbin’, Lucas.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Better.
text: Julie stares at him, waiting for more... doesn’t get it,
dialog: SO...
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I need more than that. What was
dialog: down there?
speaker_heading: DANE LUCAS
dialog: My father. Clowns.
text: Dane looks at Lucas... what?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Didn’t you see them? It was like
dialog: this giant, scary circus. There
dialog: were clowns everywhere.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: All the clowns that kept chasing
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Was that before we crawled into the
dialog: kitchen?
text: Now Lucas is looking at Dane like he’s crazy.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: What kitchen?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: Where the rope was... we were
dialog: climbing up... I told you to go on.
text: Lucas just stares at Dane a confused beat, then...
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: I didn’t see you down there.
text: Dane looks back to the trap door.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Dane, Lucas and Julie stand in the front yard, staring back
text: at the house.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Whatta we do now?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Come over to my place. We’ll
dialog: figure it.
dialog: 102.
text: Dane nods... just as HEADLIGHTS WASH OVER THEM... they turn
text: to Susan’s SUV pulling back into the driveway. She parks...
text: climbs out.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What are you three doing out here
dialog: so late?
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We were just... having trouble
dialog: sleeping.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Maybe that’s because you’re
text: standing in the driveway.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I thought you were going to be gone
dialog: for a couple days?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Had to change my plans a little.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're going to think I’m crazy.
dialog: But I had this dream... and it
dialog: seemed so real... that I lost both
dialog: of you.
dialog: (hugs them both)
dialog: And that’s my worst fear.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: I don’t think you have to worry
dialog: about that anymore.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What does that mean?
text: The kids exchange a glance.
speaker_heading: DANE
dialog: We should probably talk.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BENSONVILLE HOUSE - DAY
text: A For Sale sign stands in the yard. Susan’s SUV is parked in
dialog: the drive.
dialog: 103.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
text: Susan walks around the house with a REALTOR.
speaker_heading: REALTOR
dialog: It’s only six years old. The
dialog: nicest kitchen in town, and plenty
dialog: of storage space for those growing
dialog: boys.
text: They stop at the window... look out into the backyard... to
text: Dane and Lucas playing basketball. Julie sits in the grass,
text: watching them.
speaker_heading: REALTOR (cont’d)
dialog: Do you think they’d like to come
dialog: inside and take a look for
dialog: themselves?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Let’s leave them out there.
speaker_heading: REALTOR
dialog: Well they sure do look like they
dialog: enjoy each other.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes they do.
text: Susan and the realtor walk out of the frame, as we stay on
text: the window... and Dane and Lucas laughing... playing... being
dialog: brothers again.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (0.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: Now you said this place doesn’t
dialog: have a basement, right?
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
dialog:
