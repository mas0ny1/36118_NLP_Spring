scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAWN
text: A look at how birds live in the city, emphasizing the
text: scavenging nature of their existence. We see birds eating
text: off the ground, out of trash cans, even swooping down to
text: steal a piece of donut out of the hand of a sleepy citizen
text: just leaving his house.
text: The last bird we see flies towards the house of the Little
dialog: family.
scene_heading: INT. LITTLE HOUSE - DAY
text: The first hint of morning light enters the Little
text: household. All is quiet and peaceful. MR. AND MRS.
text: LITTLE are asleep in bed. THROUGH the window we see bird
text: eyes spying in on them.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - ALARM CLOCK
text: BLASTING a rendition of "STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER" into
dialog: the Little's bedroom.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: The bird flies off the window sill and disappears.
text: Even before they're awake, Mr. and Mrs. Little's feet
text: begin swiveling in time to the music.
text: Then we hear a BABY CRYING.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MRS. LITTLE
text: sitting upright in bed. She turns OFF the ALARM. On her
text: ring finger is a beautiful engagement ring.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Mrs. Little gets out of bed and we FOLLOW her OVER TO a
text: crib wherein sits a beautiful nine-month-old girl, MARTHA
text: LITTLE. Mrs. Little picks her up.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
dialog: Moomy's here. No more crying.
text: Martha's diaper is askew.

dialog: Ohh... See this is what happens
dialog: when Daddy changes you at 4!A.M.

dialog: Boys...
scene_heading: INT. BOY'S ROOM
text: ANOTHER ALARM CLOCK. It GOES OFF and makes a FACTORY
scene_heading: WHISTLE NOISE.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON GEORGE
text: in the lower bunk. He grumbles and turns over.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON UPPER BUNK
text: A tiny lump under a blanket as it begins to move. Moments
text: later a tail emerges from underneath the sheet. It moves
text: tentatively, as if checking things out. The tail is
text: followed by a rear-end dressed in bright pajamas with a
text: print pattern featuring pineapples (or something funnier)
text: and then the remainder of a four-inch body. It is STUART.
dialog: (For those who haven't read the book or seen the movie,
dialog: Stuart is a mouse.)
text: Stuart is sleepy. He staggers around almost blindly. He
text: almost steps off the edge of his bunk. This wakes him
text: more completely. He rubs his eyes and stretches and
text: smiles. Grabbing hold of a miniature fireman's pole built
text: out of tinker toys, slides down to the lower bunk and
text: crosses over to George's sleeping head.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: George, wake up.
text: George is a hard wake-up.
text: Stuart stands on George's chest and jumps up and down.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: George.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's Saturday.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: I know. But it's the first day of
dialog: Pee Wee Soccer. Our first game.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: George's eyes pop open and he gasps. He's immediately
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Soccer? Uh... No I can't today,
dialog: I... caught a cold while I was
dialog: sleeping.
text: He sneezes and blows Stuart halfway across the bed.
text: Stuart scrambles back quickly. He grabs George's glasses
text: from the nightstand and masterfully engineers them onto
text: George's face. He taps on the glasses.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: You'll be fine. Come on, we're
dialog: gonna be great. We're gonna play
dialog: like Brazilians!
text: Stuart takes off his pajama top and soccer-kicks it across
text: the room into a hamper.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Mrs. Little is rushing around the kitchen, feeding the
text: baby and making breakfast for everyone at the same time.
text: The CAMERA FOLLOWS her TO the kitchen table as she puts
text: another spoonful of cereal into the baby's mouth. The
text: baby is sitting in her highchair between her brothers who
text: are in their uniforms.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
dialog: Stuart, don't forget your water
dialog: bottle. George...
text: Mr. Little enters on the run.
speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE

dialog: Where's the baby book? I'1l write
dialog: it down.
speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE
dialog: I'm... not sure that's actually a
dialog: word.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
dialog: Your Uncle Crenshaw said that
dialog: every Little starts talking by
dialog: nine months.
speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE
dialog: Yes and in Uncle Crenshaw's case
dialog: never stops.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Are you both coming to the game?
speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE
dialog: Wouldn't miss it.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
dialog: (sotto)

text: He starts opening a jar.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Anxious. Especially ‘bout...

speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE
dialog: He's fine.

dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Honey, he's a Little. We're all
dialog: natural athletes.
dialog: (handing her the jar)
dialog: Could you open this?
dialog: She does.
text: The toast is burning, the TEA is WHISTLING, the BABY is
text: CRYING, and Mrs. Little is clearly overwhelmed.
text: Then the baby pours the remainder of the cereal onto her
text: head and throws the bowl onto the floor. Mrs. Little
text: quickly lifts her from the highchair and rushes her to the
dialog: sink.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
dialog: Okay, that's it for you.

speaker_heading: SNOWBELL

scene_heading: EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

dialog: the kids are bigger, more aggressive and better co-
dialog: ordinated.
speaker_heading: STANDS

text: Among the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Little watch the game.
text: Mrs. Little holds Martha.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
dialog: Frederick, why are all the kids
text: running one way while George is
dialog: going the other way?
speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE
dialog: Well, he, uh... he's an
dialog: independent spirit. What bothers
dialog: me is, every kid has had a chance
dialog: to play except Stuart.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
dialog: Well, there's plenty of time.
speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE
dialog: Plenty of time? There's forty
dialog: seconds.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE

dialog: Nobody gets hurt.
speaker_heading: FIELD
text: A KID on George's team gets kicked in the stomach. He

speaker_heading: IRWIN (KID)

speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: Get it! George! Go after it!
text: George and Stuart from opposite directions run towards the

speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: George, shoot!
text: Wallace appears out on the wing.
speaker_heading: WALLACE
dialog: Pass me the ball, lame-o!
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: George, shoot!
text: George shuts his eyes and kicks at the exact moment Stuart
text: reaches the ball. The ball flies off the ground with
text: Stuart pasted to it, screaming. The ball hits Wallace --
text: hard -- in the middle of his face and ricochets off.
text: Wallace, knocked loopy, has the imprint of a mouse on his
dialog: forehead.
text: The ball -- still flying. Stuart still on it, screaming.
text: It sails into the goal. The GUN GOES OFF. The game is
dialog: over.
text: George is mobbed by happy teammates. He is literally

speaker_heading: GOAL

scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE

dialog: So... lacking in bigness. Does
dialog: he have to go back next week?
speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE
dialog: Honey, we have to give him room to
dialog: grow.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
text: I give him room. I let him drive
dialog: his car to school. No other
dialog: mother does that.
speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE
dialog: Yes, but with George walking right
text: beside him every step.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
dialog: I let him go out without his
text: galoshes.
speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE
dialog: When it's not raining.
scene_heading: MRS. LITTLE
dialog: So? How much more room do I need

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Painting or dancing.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's hard to get hurt doing those.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: (glumly )
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I guess it's my fault. I'm sorry
dialog: I kicked you into the goal.
speaker_heading: STUART

text: clicks it ON by accident.
text: Suddenly the MOTOR WHIRS into action. Snowbell, hearing
text: the noise, screams, jumps up and dashes out.
text: Before Stuart realizes what is happening, the airplane is

speaker_heading: MR. LITTLE

text: the sky and land in the passenger seat of his car.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Oh, my -- !
text: Startled, her swerves the CAR all over the sidewalk until
text: SCREECHING to a stop. He stares at the bird, lying in his
text: car. Although, we don't know it yet, her name is MARGALO.
text: Stuart stares at her with a mixture of concern and
dialog: fascination. She is definitely a unique creature, not
text: much bigger than Stuart. She is wearing a pilot's leather
text: helmet, and goggles and looks like what Amelia Earhart
text: might have looked like if she was a bird. Cautiously he
text: reaches out to touch her.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Miss?... Miss?... Are you alive?

speaker_heading: MARGALO

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Falcon? What Falcon?
text: At that instant, a huge terrifying BIRD swoops down from

speaker_heading: MARGALO
dialog: That Falcon!! Drive! Get out of

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Oh, my!!!

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Uh-oh, we've got a problem.
speaker_heading: MARGALO
dialog: You can make it! Don't slow down.

speaker_heading: MARGALO
dialog: See! What'd I tell ya?

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Yeah!!!!
speaker_heading: CAR
text: lands safely on the down-sloping grate and continues along
text: the sidewalk, but the massive bird is still in full

text: Stuart SCREECHES around a corner and spots a stack of
text: plumbing supplies piled in front of a building. He zooms
text: into an eight-foot long plastic pipe, about six inches in
text: diameter. Peering out the far end he can see Falcon

dialog: It's not like that! You don't

speaker_heading: FALCON
