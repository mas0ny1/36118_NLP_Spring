text: CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH glass windows. Reflections of the
text: city, of office workers, of a woman speaking into a
dialog: microphone.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm Erica Bain, and as you know, I
dialog: walk the city. I bitch and moan
dialog: about it. I walk and watch and
dialog: listen. I witness all the beauty
dialog: and ugliness that is disappearing
dialog: from our beloved city. Last week
dialog: took me to the grey depths of the
dialog: East River where Dimitri Panchenko
text: swims his laps like he has since
dialog: the 1960s. And today I walked by
text: the acres of scaffolding outside
dialog: what used to be the Plaza Hotel
dialog: and I thought about Eloise.
dialog: Remember Kay Thompson's Eloise?
dialog: Eloise who lived in the Plaza
text: Hotel, with her dog Weenie and her
dialog: parents who were always away and
dialog: her English nanny who had 8
dialog: hairpins made out of bones --
text: As she talks, we see her -- thin, semi-transperant,
text: ghostlike. Almost nothing but voice.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: That Eloise. The adored brat of
dialog: my childhood. A little punk kid
text: pirouetting round the grand
text: ballroom, pouring pitchers of water
text: down the mail chute, Upper East Side
dialog: anarchist in pigtails, not unlike
dialog: other brats and punks this city has
text: brought to life. Sid Vicious spewing
text: beer from his teeth in the Chelsea
text: Hotel. Andy Warhol, his sunglasses
text: reflecting Valerie Solana's gun.
dialog: Edgar Allen Poe freeing live monkeys
text: from the crates of a crumbling schooner
text: on oily slips of South Street. Stories
text: of a city that is disappearing before
text: our eyes, its people swept over the
dialog: Williamsburg, the Holland Tunnel,
dialog: the Major Degan.

dialog: You can visit, but you can't live

dialog: left of those stories? Are we
dialog: going to have to construct an
dialog: imaginary city to house our
dialog: memories? Because when you love
dialog: something, every time a bit of it
dialog: goes, you lose a piece of
dialog: yourself. So where's Eloise going
dialog: to sleep tonight? Can you hear
text: her ghost wandering round the
dialog: collapsing corridors of her
text: beloved Plaza, trying to find her
text: nanny's room, calling out to
dialog: construction
text: workers in a voice that nobody
dialog: hears, has anyone seen my turtle

text: DAVID KARMANI, late 20s, dressed in RN scrubs, attends to
text: a patient sitting in the solarium.
dialog: His face -- thin, dark, beautiful, could be Italian,
text: Spanish, Black -- an indistinguishable mix, he is like
text: the future and the past all rolled up in one. A small
text: CROSS, old, silver, sits on a chain around his neck --
dialog: not as a fashion statement, or a fuck you, but a simple,
dialog: personal, intimate expression of faith.
text: A DOCTOR, a woman, all business, comes behind him.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: Could you go to room 512, the

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Uh... okay.

text: It stops her -- for just a moment.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I am such a god-awful bitch,
dialog: sorry.
text: She leaves.

scene_heading: INT. LOFT - DAY
text: A photography show. Kind of groovy, a tad trendy but

text: Erica drifts away, checks out the PHOTOGRAPHS -- a series
text: of '60s storefronts, a GUN STORE, a LAUNDROMAT, a LIQUOR
speaker_heading: STORE.
text: She SCANS them, taking in every detail, every color,

speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Hi.
text: He gives Erica a kiss.
speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: JAMES

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't you love this woman?
speaker_heading: NICOLE

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My mother told me once, if you
dialog: want to love someone, see if you

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (laughingly)

speaker_heading: ERICA

scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT 12
text: Curtis gets a little frisky, hopping around.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He knows I'm carrying.
text: David reaches behind his back and pulls out the ball.
text: CURTIS starts BARKING and jumping around excitedly.
text: Erica unfastens his leash.
text: David gives the ball a toss. Curtis runs after it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I meant it, you know. What's

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Iam. Or kind of hope I hope I

dialog: She wants the whole deal.
text: Invites, a minister, the band
dialog: playing. Maybe I want it too.
dialog: It's not as if I'm going to do it
dialog: twice.
text: He looks at her. She really means it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think that's the nicest thing
dialog: you ever said to me.

text: They look around, notice for the first time it's gotten
dialog: dark.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Curtis? Curtis, come here, boy.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Curtis!

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: DAVID

scene_heading: 14 EXT. CENTRAL PARK/PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL - NIGHT 14
text: The tall thin guy, REED, steps through the bushes holding

speaker_heading: REED
dialog: Hey, don't you know there's a
dialog: fuckin' leash law?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, sorry. Thanks for finding

speaker_heading: REED

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, sure -- our gratitude. Now
dialog: give him to me.
speaker_heading: REED

scene_heading: INT. ERICA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT) 21

speaker_heading: MERCER

speaker_heading: MERCER

speaker_heading: MERCER

text: LIT BY THE FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS: A strange sense of
text: blankness in her face. Mixed with the WAILING OF SIRENS

text: turns, and walks into it.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - NIGHT 83
text: LOUD MUSIC. A brash, dating crowd. Erica pushes through
text: a sea of men's faces and walks down circular stairs
text: towards the restroom.
scene_heading: INT. BAR RESTROOM - NIGHT A84
text: Erica pushes through the door and dry-retches into the
text: sink. Her face is now covered in beads of sweat. She
text: runs the taps and bathes her face in water. Breathes
text: deeply, looks up at the stranger in the mirror. Herself.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Hey, you...
text: ON her face in the mirror. Unnaturally calm, again.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT 84

speaker_heading: VITALE

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON MERCER

speaker_heading: VITALE

speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: Check it against Brass-Catcher,

text: He gives Vitale the casing, walks over to one of the
text: bodies, crouches down, looks at the tear the bullet made
text: in the guy's T-shirt, checks the angle and level of
dialog: entry.
text: Looks at the IPOD next to the GUY, the ALBUM COVER still
text: on the screen -- RADIOHEAD, looks at the dead guy's
text: clothes -- not a fit -- he turns the IPOD over, sees the
text: SERIAL NUMBER, bags it.
text: Vitale comes over.
speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: Neither one robbed. Both have
text: cash in their pockets.
text: The CORONER and an assistant start to bag the body of the
text: man who died sitting up.
speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: Hey, what're you doing?
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: (attitude)
text: Takin' him to the morgue.
speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: I'll tell you when you can take
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: My shift is ending, as it is I'll
dialog: be lucky if I have time for both
dialog: bodies. So, how about you just
dialog: let me do my job?
speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: How about you don't do anything
dialog: until I'm done?
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: How about, fuck you, asshole?

text: the scene, yet repulsed by it.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 87

text: of blood across the floor.
speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: They both have priors?
speaker_heading: VITALE
text: A busload of them.
speaker_heading: MERCER

speaker_heading: VITALE
dialog: That was domestic --
speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: Yeah -- I don't know, there's
dialog: something.

speaker_heading: MERCER

dialog: will be there.
dialog: Everything about her is different -- her walk, the hunch

scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT 90
text: Mercer emerging from the subway entrance. There's still

speaker_heading: MERCER

speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: You see, there was no vigilante.
text: Just three punks on a killing
dialog: spree. They got a taste of it in

speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: You know, that really hurts...
text: She drops the gun, bends down to him.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: He holds her with his good arm. She buries her head in
