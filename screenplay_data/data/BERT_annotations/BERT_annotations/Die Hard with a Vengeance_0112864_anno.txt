text: Zeus sees the gun before anyone else.
text: He lunges behind McClane and RIPS the gun from McClane’s
dialog: back, tape and all.
text: zeus brings the gun down, training it on the Gang
text: Members, wildly, back and forth, from member to member.
text: Startled, they recoil.
text: Except for Gang Member 1, who sticks the switchblade

speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Put it down.
text: A tense pause.
text: Zeus cocks the gun. His hand is rock steady.
speaker_heading: ZEUS .
dialog: I’1l kill you. I won’t want to, but
dialog: I’1l do it.
text: Gang Member 1 tosses the knife down. He backs off.
text: McClane joins Zeus. At this moment --
text: A HARLEM LIVERY CAB comes up to the intersection and

text: Zeus points a gun at THE LIVERY CAB DRIVER, who looks

speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: Stay where you are.
text: Zeus motions to McClane.
text: McClane moves to the cab, Zeus following, stepping

speaker_heading: ZEUS
dialog: I’m not going in there. There’s

speaker_heading: MCCLANE
dialog: You can give a statement now or you

speaker_heading: ” COBB
dialog: How can you be sure of that?
speaker_heading: MCCLANE
dialog: "Simon." It’s not an ordinary name.
dialog: I’d remember it. We’re up the wrong

speaker_heading: MAN IN CORNER
dialog: I disagree, Lieutenant.
text: McClane turns.
text: In the corner is a MAN, 40’s, smoking a pipe.
speaker_heading: MCCLANE
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: COBB
dialog: Fred Schilling, John. Fred does a
dialog: lot of our psychiatric criminal
dialog: evaluations at Bellevue hospital.- I
dialog: asked him to be here. What’s your
dialog: opinion, Doctor?
text: A pause. Schilling puffs his pipe.
scene_heading: DR. SCHILLING
dialog: Any understanding of this character
dialog: starts, necessarily, with an
dialog: understanding of megalomania - it’s
dialog: a sickness - a pathological
dialog: condition in which fantasies of
dialog: control, or omnipotence,
dialog: predominate.
speaker_heading: MCCLANE
dialog: Speak English.
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: DR. SCHILLING
dialog: He wants control over you - every
dialog: move you make, your thoughts, your
dialog: emotions. Megalomaniacs don’t
dialog: operate anonymously - they need to
dialog: know that you’ know who they are.
text: (beat; he puffs on his
dialog: pipe)
dialog: I can virtually guarantee this man’s
dialog: name is Simon - or possibly some
dialog: variation of that.
speaker_heading: LAMBERT
dialog: Doesn’t have to be his first name.
dialog: (looks at file)
dialog: I’ve got a Robert E. Simon right

dialog: He was released to the state work-
dialog: furlough program two months ago.
speaker_heading: COBB
dialog: Check it out, Joe.
speaker_heading: MCCLANE
dialog: You’re wasting your time. Bob Simon
dialog: was a bankrupt businessman who
dialog: kidnapped his former partner’s
dialog: daughter. He’s a fuck-up, not a
dialog: Psychopath. The guy we’re dealing
dialog: with is nuts.
speaker_heading: WEISS (0.s.)

dialog: stuff.
text: Weiss sets the briefcase on the desk. Attached to the
text: briefcase is a SMALL BOX with a protruding ANTENNAE.
speaker_heading: WEISS
dialog: Ten pounds of plastique, just like
dialog: he said. The detonation system's
dialog: not a fuse, not a timer. It’s that.
dialog: (points at the box)
dialog: Radio transmittor. Super high,
dialog: super delicate frequency. Now
dialog: watch.
text: He pops open the briefcase. A HUGE PACKAGE OF PLASTIQUE
text: EXPLOSIVE and a BLASTING CAP is within. Wires run from
text: the transmittor to the blasting cap.
text: Lambert, seeing the explosive, recoils.
speaker_heading: LAMBERT
dialog: Christ, Charlie!
speaker_heading: WEISS
dialog: Take it easy. It’s disarmed. The
dialog: beauty of this system is that it can
dialog: be detonated from anywhere up to
text: ten, twenty miles away.
text: (he looks up at the
dialog: others)
dialog: Your boy’s no amateur, Arthur. This
dialog: is the most sophisticated system in

speaker_heading: COBB
dialog: Charlie...? We get the message.

speaker_heading: WIESS
dialog: This is gonna be an interesting one,

speaker_heading: COBB

speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: I’m hurt. Really. I’m not very

dialog: Marvelous. Where are my pigeons?
dialog: (cheery)

dialog: What was the reason they did go?
