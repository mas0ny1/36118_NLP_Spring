scene_heading: 1 EXT. FIELD OF DAISIES - DAY - FLASHBACK 1
dialog: CAMERA FLIES OVER the "Welcome to Couer d'Couers" sign at
dialog: the field's edge to FIND a bright, care-free boy of about 10
dialog: (YOUNG NED) racing through the flowers sending petals flying
text: as he chases his dog DIGBY, an adorable yellow lab as bright
dialog: and care-free as Young Ned. Our OMNISCIENT NARRATOR (imagine
dialog: Patrick Stewart reading a bedtime story) begins:
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: At this very moment in the town of
dialog: Couer d'Couers, Young Ned was 9 years,
dialog: 27 weeks, 6 days, and 3 minutes old.
text: Young Ned is only a few feet behind his dog, 3 sets of legs
text: speeding through the brush. He reaches out trying to make
dialog: contact, but Digby is just out of touch. Closer... closer...
text: The brush gives way to a clearing. Closer... closer, still...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: His dog Digby was 3 years, 2 weeks,
dialog: 6 days, 5 hours and 9 minutes old.
text: WHAM. Out of nowhere, Digby is HIT BY A PASSING SEMI-TRUCK.
text: A BLUR OF BIG RIG obscures the impact. Ned stops, horrified.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: And not a minute older.
text: TIME SLOWS TO A CRAWL. FUR SAILS THROUGH THE AIR, as if Digby
dialog: was taking flight by his own propulsion. ALL SOUND DROPS OUT
text: except for the RAPID, RHYTHMIC POUNDING of Ned's HEART and
text: the EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION of his LUNGS.
text: He approaches the unmoving body of his dead dog Digby.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: This was the moment Young Ned realized
dialog: he wasn't like the other children.
dialog: Nor was he like anyone else for that
dialog: matter.
text: Ned kneels down beside Digby and as he reaches out to stroke
dialog: the dog's matted fur... CAMERA JUMP CUTS TO:
scene_heading: AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP OF NED'S FINGER
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 2.
text: The ridges of his fingertip look like circular troughs. As
text: Ned touches his dog we see a small STATIC POP OF ELECTRICITY
dialog: between his finger and Digby's fur.
speaker_heading: CAMERA JUMPS WIDE
text: TIME RESUMES TO NORMAL as Digby inexplicably scrambles to
text: his feet with a happy dog-smile on his face and runs off
dialog: into the field of daisies.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Young Ned could touch dead things
dialog: and bring them back to life.
text: Young Ned watches slack-jawed and furrow-browed as Digby
text: disappears over the horizon. He stares at his finger, not
dialog: sure exactly what just happened.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON - A FLY
text: It lands on a cupboard door and darts to and fro until SMACK.
dialog: A FLY SWATTER ends its life in one abrupt movement. We are...
scene_heading: 2 INT. NED'S CHILDHOOD HOME - KITCHEN - DAY - FLASHBACK 2
text: The dead fly lands on the counter top. Young Ned's MOTHER
text: sets the fly swatter down and returns to lovingly preparing
text: a pie, pressing dough into the pie plate.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: It was a gift given to him, but not
dialog: by anyone in particular. There was
dialog: no box, no instructions, no
dialog: manufacturer's warranty. It just
dialog: was.
text: Young Ned peers over the edge of the counter, reaching in
text: and touching the dead fly. There's a small ELECTRIC POP then
text: the fly flies up and out the open window.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: The terms of use weren't immediately
dialog: clear nor were they of immediate
dialog: concern.
dialog: CAMERA FOLLOWS THE FLY and Young Ned's gaze to:
scene_heading: 3 EXT. NEIGHBOR GIRL'S HOME - DAY - FLASHBACK 3
text: A girl named CHUCK, pig-tails et al, plays in the back yard.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Young Ned was in love.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 3.
dialog: She's making a small village out of mounds of dirt and
dialog: cardboard boxes with Play-Doh people and toy cars as her
text: FATHER waters the lawn in the background.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Her name was Chuck. At this very
dialog: moment, she was 8 years, 42 weeks, 3
dialog: hours and 2 minutes old.
dialog: She squeezes a little people head out of the Play-Doh Fun
text: Factory and places it on the body she's already constructed.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Young Ned did not think of her as
dialog: being born or hatched or conceived
dialog: in any way. Chuck came ready made
dialog: from the Play-Doh Fun Factory of
dialog: Life.
dialog: She makes the final few touches on her village and it COMES
text: TO LIFE THROUGH THE MAGIC OF IMAGINATION.
speaker_heading: CHUCK'S P.O.V. - IMAGINATION REALIZED
text: Large as life, TOY CARS drive through tiny streets, and TOY
text: PEOPLE mill about on tiny sidewalks.
scene_heading: BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The ground SHAKES. The TOY PEOPLE
dialog: react to the strangeness... then a GIANT REPTILIAN LEG STOMPS
text: into a cardboard building, crushing it.
dialog: CAMERA REVEALS A GIANT PIG-TAILED GODZILLA stomping through
dialog: the village, sparing no one as PLAY-DOH PEOPLE SCRAMBLE.
dialog: And just when we think a lone TOM CRUISE-ESQUE PLAY-DOH PERSON
scene_heading: has escaped... SQUISH. A GIANT RODAN-ESQUE WINGED DINOSAUR
dialog: looking as much like Ned as the Godzilla looks like Chuck
dialog: (wearing the same clothes, etc.) stomps him good.
speaker_heading: SMASH BACK TO REALITY
text: Chuck and Ned are stomping through the remains of her small
dialog: village, having an absolute ball and getting very dirty.
speaker_heading: ON NED
text: His Mother is sweeping the dirt off of him with a broom.
scene_heading: 4 INT. NED'S CHILDHOOD HOME - KITCHEN - DAY - FLASHBACK 4
text: Freshly broomed, Young Ned stares out the window as filthy
text: Chuck is getting hosed off in the backyard by her Father.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: He was under Chuck's spell... until
dialog: a blood vessel in his mother's brain
dialog: burst, killing her instantly.
dialog: IN THE BACKGROUND, WE SEE NED'S MOTHER CUTTING FRUIT ONE
text: MOMENT THEN ABRUPTLY DROPPING OUT OF FRAME.
scene_heading: 5 INT. NED'S CHILDHOOD HOME - KITCHEN - DAY - FLASHBACK 5
text: Young Ned turns away from the window to find his Mother dead
text: on the linoleum floor next to the stove.
scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSE UP - MOTHER'S OPEN AND STARING EYE
text: Young Ned reaches into FRAME and touches his Mother's cheek
text: just below the eye. A BOLT OF STATIC ELECTRICITY. Her
text: constricted pupil dilates and Ned's Mother blinks.
text: DING. The timer goes off.
speaker_heading: ON NED
text: He slowly backs away as his Mother stares at him. A CLOCK
text: appears in the corner of the OUR SCREEN and begins counting
dialog: down from ONE MINUTE. 59 seconds... 58... 57...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Young Ned's random gift that was
dialog: came with a caveat or two...
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Did the timer go off?
text: Young Ned nods as his Mother gets to her feet, brushes off
text: her apron and pulls on a pair of OVEN MITTS.
speaker_heading: MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I must've slipped. Clumsy. Hmmm.
text: Ned sits at the kitchen table, unable to look away as his
text: Mother pulls a pie out of the oven. 37 seconds... 36...
text: Ned's Mother places the pie in the kitchen window to cool.
speaker_heading: ON CHUCK IN HER YARD
text: She kicks over the last standing building and runs inside as
text: her Father continues to water the lawn in the background.
dialog: The COUNTDOWN continues... 23... 22... 21...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: ON NED AND HIS MOTHER
text: Ned watches as his Mother readies a second pie to go into
dialog: the oven. 11... 10... 9... 8...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: It was a gift that not only gave...
dialog: it took.
dialog: Ned's Mother twists the timer around, puts a new pie in the
text: oven and as she closes the oven door. The CLOCK HAND has
dialog: traveled almost full circle: 4... 3... 2...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Young Ned discovered he could only
dialog: bring the dead back to life for one
dialog: minute without consequence. Any longer
dialog: and someone else had to die.
dialog: INCLUDE THE KITCHEN WINDOW, through which we can SEE Chuck's
dialog: Father drop dead. Young Ned and his Mother don't immediately
dialog: see this because their backs are to the window.
text: Ned's Mother cuts a piece of pie, puts it on a plate, and
text: sets it down in front of Young Ned. He takes a bite. Heaven.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: It was the most delicious pie ever
dialog: baked because it was the pie that
dialog: was not meant to be.
text: His Mother's GASP draws his attention to the window, where
text: they can see Chuck's Father dead in the yard.
scene_heading: 6 INT. NED'S CHILDHOOD HOME - NED'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 6
text: Ned stares out the window at an AMBULANCE slowly pulling
text: away from Chuck's house without its lights on, horrified.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Young Ned realized somehow in the
dialog: grand universal scheme of things, he
dialog: had traded his mother's life for
dialog: Chuck's father's.
speaker_heading: NED'S MOTHER
dialog: Come on, big daddy, into bed.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: And he was horrified.
dialog: Ned's Mother pulls up the blankets so Ned can slide into
text: bed. She draws the blanket up to his chest. (NOTE: Never
dialog: touching him directly.)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: But there was one more thing about
dialog: touching dead things that Young Ned
dialog: didn't know. And he learned it in
dialog: the most unfortunate way.
text: She moves to kiss Ned on his forehead.
scene_heading: EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE ON - NED'S MOTHER'S LIPS
text: As they're about to make contact with his forehead, we see a
speaker_heading: STATIC POP OF ELECTRICITY.
speaker_heading: GO WIDE
text: Ned's Mother drops dead right then and there.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: First touch, life. Second touch,
dialog: dead again forever.
text: Ned kneels next to his dead mother, poking her cheek, waiting
text: for her to open her eyes again. She doesn't.
scene_heading: 7 EXT. NED'S HOME/CHUCK'S HOME - DAY - FLASHBACK 7
text: Young Ned sits on the porch, dressed all in black. He watches
dialog: as Chuck's 30-something Grey Garden-esque aunts (VIVIAN and
text: LILY) drag large steamer trunks into Chuck's house.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Chuck was orphaned when her father
dialog: died and fostered by her aunts Vivian
dialog: and Lily. A renowned synchronized
dialog: swimming duo, they shared matching
dialog: personality disorders and a love for
dialog: fine cheese.
scene_heading: 8 INT. NED'S CHILDHOOD HOME - NED'S BEDROOM - FLASHBACK 8
text: Young Ned watches as his FATHER fills a steamer trunk with
dialog: all the belongings from his room, his Rodan costume,
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: For all intents, Young Ned was
dialog: orphaned, too. After a brief mourning
dialog: period, his father panicked at raising
dialog: a child alone. In the wake of that
dialog: panic, Ned was hustled off to boarding
dialog: school.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. JEWISH/CHRISTIAN GRAVEYARD - LATE DAY - FLASHBACK 9
speaker_heading: The JEWISH and CHRISTIAN GRAVEYARDS are two halves of the
dialog: same cemetary. The Synagogue and Church on either end of the
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 7.
text: hillside graveyard. Two funerals are taking place, one on
dialog: each side of the graveyard.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: At their respective parent's
dialog: funerals...
scene_heading: 10 EXT. GRAVEYARD - SUNSET- FLASHBACK 10
dialog: The peak of the cemetary hill. Young Ned and the Neighbor
text: Girl ENTER FRAME from their respective side, silhouetted by
text: the sun. She takes his hand and kisses him on the lips.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: ...dizzy with grief, curiosity and
dialog: hormones, Young Ned and a girl named
dialog: Chuck had their first and only kiss.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER
text: Young Ned watches the Neighbor Girl head back down the hill.
text: After a moment, Young Ned's dog Digby returns and bounds
text: right up to Ned. He reaches out to pet Digby and the dog
text: pulls away. Despite this, Digby wags his tail and smiles,
text: keeping a safe distance. As Young Ned leads Digby down the
text: other side of cemetary hill, CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: The effect of his Mother's death on
dialog: Ned's psyche was twofold. He avoided
dialog: social attachments, fearing what
dialog: he'd do if someone else he loved
dialog: died. Secondly, he became obsessed
dialog: with pies.
text: The setting sun shining bright and round MORPHS INTO A GOLDEN
dialog: BROWN PIE on a cloud-print tablecloth. We are:
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: It's 19 years, 34 weeks, 1 day and
dialog: 59 minutes later...
scene_heading: 11 INT. PIE HOLE - KITCHEN - DAY - PRESENT 11
dialog: We're on a cooling window, the shelves lined with the
text: cloudprint tablecloth. On a pillow on the floor, is DIGBY.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Young Ned has become "The Pie-Maker,"
dialog: owner and pastry chef of "The Pie
dialog: Hole."
text: CAMERA FINDS a PAIR OF HANDS rolling and kneading dough.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: The expression "pie in the sky"
dialog: entered popular culture in 1911,
dialog: referring to a dessert so sweet it
dialog: can only be found in heaven. But...
scene_heading: 12 EXT. PIE HOLE - DAY 12
dialog: A charming Parisian (in tone)/American (in style) googieesque
dialog: bakery. The front of the business is rounded and given the
text: facade of a giant pie wedged into the ground floors of an
text: ADJACENT APARTMENT BUILDING, complete with a pie-crust roof.
dialog: A sign reads: The Pie Hole.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: ...if you crave something before you
dialog: die I recommend where the Pie Maker
dialog: makes his pies.
scene_heading: 13 INT. PIE HOLE - KITCHEN - DAY - PRESENT 13
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the back of the Pie Maker as he works,
text: lining the pie pan with dough, not yet showing his face.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: The peaches never brown. Berries
dialog: ripe as the instant they were plucked.
dialog: If they weren't so delicious and
dialog: eaten so quickly, folks might notice
dialog: the pies stayed fresh an unusually
dialog: long time.
text: Dead, dying or bruised fruit is lovingly picked from a bowl
text: and placed into the empty pie crust. Bruises fade and dead
text: fruit spontaneously engorges with juice, ripe and tasty.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: That's because the Pie Maker
dialog: personally touches the contents of
dialog: every one.
text: A piece of NOW FRESH fruit spills out of the pie crust.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
text: The dead fruit in his hands becomes
dialog: ripe with ever-lasting flavor -- as
dialog: long as he only touches it once.
text: The Pie-Maker's hand snatches it before it hits the floor
text: and the fruit spontaneously shrivels and darkens.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: For this reason, the Pie-Maker is a
dialog: vegetarian.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CAMERA FINALLY REVEALS NED'S FACE
text: Simultaneously handsome and awkward, about 30 years of age.
text: Ned's lips are whistling but we don't hear a sound.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
text: He bakes alone, whistling quietly to
dialog: himself, rarely pursing his lips
dialog: tight enough to produce a sound.
text: Digby cocks his head, listening to what no one else can hear.
scene_heading: 14 INT. PIE HOLE - DINING AREA - DAY 14
text: Rich and textured, like the inside of a pie. Tufted booths
text: and a rounded counter bar (with spinning stools) that curves
text: parallel to the pie facade exterior. Right out of the 40's.
text: The place is dappled with customers and a single WAITRESS.
text: CAMERA FINDS OLIVE, a 20-something waitress waiting on regular
dialog: customer EMERSON, a late 30's/early 40's African-American
dialog: man in a seersucker suit.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Every day I come in, I pick a pie
dialog: and concentrate all my love on that
dialog: pie. If I love it, then someone
dialog: else will love it. And you know what?
dialog: By the end of the day I've sold more
dialog: of those pies than any other pie in
dialog: the bakery.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Yeah? What pie do you love today?
speaker_heading: CAMERA PUSHES IN:
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Rhubarb.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: I'll stick with three plum. Ala mode.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Emerson Cod, soon to be enjoying a
dialog: slice of three plum pie ala mode,
dialog: was the sole keeper of the Pie Maker's
dialog: secret.
scene_heading: 15 EXT. CITY - ROOFTOP - FLASHBACK 15
text: EMERSON chases a RUNNING MAN across a rooftop.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: And how he came to be the sole keeper
dialog: of the Pie Maker's secret...
text: The Running Man jumps to make it to the next building and
text: misses, plunging 10 stories to his death. Emerson looks over
text: the ledge to see the Running Man HIT a trash bin with a BONE-
dialog: CRUNCHING WHAM that most definitely killed the man. But he
dialog: BOUNCES into a SLIGHTLY YOUNGER NED who happened to be
dialog: emptying the trash at the time.
scene_heading: CAMERA JUMPS TO AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP of the
dialog: impact and we SEE the POP OF STATIC ELECTRICITY.
text: CAMERA POPS WIDE as the Dead Running Man OPENS HIS EYES and
text: takes off again. Slightly Younger Ned gives chase.
text: Emerson watches as Slightly Younger Ned tackles the Running
dialog: Man and he goes limp.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: After the runaway corpse, Emerson
dialog: Cod, a Private Investigator, proposed
dialog: a partnership with the Pie Maker.
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Emerson staring, slack-jawed.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Murders are much easier to solve
dialog: when you can ask the victim who killed
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: 16 RESUME - PIE HOLE - DAY 16
text: Ned watches Emerson through the porthole window in the kitchen
text: door. Emerson looks up from his pie. Their eyes connect.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Since the bakery was on the verge of
dialog: financial ruin, the Pie Maker agreed
dialog: so he could keep his Pie Hole open.
scene_heading: 17 INT. PIE HOLE - NIGHT 17
text: It's after hours and the bakery is closed. Blinds are drawn
text: over the windows and the lights are dim. As CAMERA FINDS Ned
text: and Emerson sitting at a booth speaking in hushed tones.
text: Ned, forever the handsome, articulate recluse, fidgets a
text: bit, uncomfortable in his own skin. Digby sits nearby
speaker_heading: listening to them MID-CONVERSATION:
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I asked you not to use the word
dialog: "zombie." It's disrespectful.
dialog: Stumbling around, squawking for
dialog: brains. That's not how they do. And
dialog: "undead?" Nobody wants to be un-
dialog: anything. Why begin a statement with
dialog: a negative? It's like saying "I don't
dialog: disagree." Just say you agree.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Are you comfortable with "living
dialog: dead?"
text: Ned shakes his head for a long beat.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: You're either living or you're dead.
dialog: When you're living, you're alive.
dialog: When you're dead, that's what you
dialog: are. And when you're dead and then
dialog: you're not, you're alive again. Can't
dialog: we say "alive again?" Doesn't that
dialog: sound nice?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Sounds like you're a narcoleptic.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I suffer from sudden and
dialog: uncontrollable attacks of deep sleep?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: What's the other one?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Necrophiliac.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Words that sound alike get mixed up
dialog: in my head. Used to think masturbation
dialog: meant chewing your food. Now are you
dialog: interested in this opportunity or
dialog: not?
dialog: (off his hesitation)
dialog: A dog is involved.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: (glances at Digby)
dialog: What kinda dog?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Gonna be a dead dog. A dead dog named
dialog: Cantaloupe. Putting her down.
dialog: Allegedly killed her owner.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: When you say allegedly --
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Cantaloupe was framed. Someone put
dialog: part of the victim in her mouth.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Docile as a kitten, says the family.
text: Emerson holds up a picture of the dog, a chow.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Despite it being a chow -- the breed
dialog: most likely to turn on its owner.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: That's racial profiling. Looky here,
dialog: if the dog's innocent, it's murder.
dialog: If it's murder, then there's a reward.
scene_heading: 18 AN OIL PAINTING - LEONARD GASWINT AND HIS DOG, CANTALOUPE 18
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: The facts were these: one Leonard
dialog: Gaswint, 39 years, 42 weeks, 5 days,
dialog: 3 hours and 26 minutes old, was found
text: mauled to death in a parking garage.
scene_heading: 19 INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 19
text: A chow named Cantaloupe cleans himself next to a parked car
text: which partially obscures Leonard Gaswint's corpse.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: His dog Cantaloupe was the soul
dialog: witness and only suspect in the
dialog: murder.
speaker_heading: 20 A REWARD SIGN 20
dialog: There's a business photo of Leonard Gaswint with text that
dialog: reads: "REWARD $20,000."
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Convinced of her innocence, the
dialog: Gaswint family offered a significant
dialog: reward to find the real killer.

speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: You the dog expert?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: CORONER
dialog: Already had a dog expert.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I'm the, uh... other one.
scene_heading: 23 INT. COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE - MORGUE - DAY 23
text: Emerson and Ned approach a sheet-covered body on a slab.
text: Ned peeks under the sheet and Emerson takes a step back.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: How's he look?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: He looks fine, but my threshold is
dialog: pretty high so you have to take what
dialog: I say with a grain of salt.
text: Emerson takes a peek under the sheet himself.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: It's not a grain of salt. It's one
dialog: of those blocks they give cows to
dialog: lick. The man's tore up.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: He can't help the way he is.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: It doesn't make it any less traumatic.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: For who?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Me. And I'm sure him. But mainly me.
dialog: I'm fine when they don't move. It's
dialog: when they move that I have a problem.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Would it help if I turned off the
dialog: light?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Yes.
text: Ned turns off a metal floor lamp next to the drawer, casting
text: a shadow over the body and obscuring it. Emerson pulls back
text: the sheet and reacts to the OFF-CAMERA corpse, mortified.
speaker_heading: EMERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna wait outside.
text: Ned watches as Emerson quickly disappears out the door. As
dialog: Ned's about to touch dead Leonard Gaswint's hand... CAMERA
text: JUMPS TO AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP and we see the
text: FAMILIAR POP OF ELECTRICITY. Ned sets the alarm on his watch.
text: A CLOCK appears in the corner of the SCREEN and begins
dialog: counting down from ONE MINUTE. 59 seconds... 58... 57...
text: Leonard Gaswint sits upright into the light revealing he's

speaker_heading: LEONARD GASWINT
dialog: No, no. Cantaloupe's docile as a

dialog: party. You know, it's a funny story...

speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: How was your convention?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 16.
text: She draws close to him, flirtatious and almost slightly
text: desperate for him to seduce her. He doesn't engage.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Conventional. How was Digby?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Neurotic. He's a very needy dog. Do

scene_heading: 29 INT. OLIVE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 29
text: Ned steps inside and around Olive.

speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: With a stick? How do you pet him?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: A stick is involved, but it's more

speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: The dog needs to be touched. We all
dialog: need to be touched.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: You touch him. Other people touch
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: He's your dog. Do you touch anything?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Of course I... I touch lots of things.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: With affection?
text: She reaches out and touches his shoulder, holding her hand

speaker_heading: OLIVE (CONT'D)
dialog: When was the last time someone touched
dialog: you with affection?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I get touched.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 17.
text: She holds his gaze for another uncomfortable moment. He clears

speaker_heading: NED (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I get Digby's leash?
dialog: (to Digby)
dialog: You don't mind that I don't touch

speaker_heading: NARRATOR

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Um, I just wanna... I wanna... Can't
dialog: I do this one alone? On account of,
dialog: you know, the whole historical
dialog: context?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Got something personal you wanna
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: No. Okay, perhaps. I have nothing to

speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Wha'cha got so open it needs closing?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: NED

speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: You only got one minute.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: 60 seconds.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I know.
text: Emerson walks out eyeing Ned, who closes the door behind
text: him. Alone in the room, Ned braces his back on the door and
text: takes a deep breath. Gulp. He slowly approaches the casket.
text: Ned runs his hand over the pine frame then lifts the lid,
text: bathing the body of Charlotte Charles, aka CHUCK, in sunlight.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Only Prince Charming could know how
dialog: the Pie-Maker felt upon looking at
dialog: her.
dialog: Even in death she's beautiful, a woman yet very much the
dialog: little girl he once knew.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Great thought was taken as to where
dialog: to touch her. The hand too impersonal,
dialog: lips too forward, the cheek... the
dialog: cheek.
text: Ned's finger closes in on Chuck's alabaster cheek and CAMERA
dialog: JUMPS TO AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP of his slow
text: caress. A CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY between finger and cheek.
text: A CLOCK appears in the corner of the SCREEN and begins
dialog: counting down from ONE MINUTE. 59...
text: Chuck opens her beautiful eyes and blinks. Ned can only stare
text: back at her. The moment is as electric as his touch.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 23.
text: He smiles at her, expecting a warm smile in return but
text: instead... WHAM. She grabs him by the jacket and SLAMS HIS
text: HEAD between the coffin and its lid. WHAM-WHAM-WHAM.
speaker_heading: NED
speaker_heading: OW.
text: Chuck scrambles out of her coffin as Ned stumbles back in a
text: daze. She grabs a chair and raises it to hit him again.
speaker_heading: NED (CONT'D)
dialog: Chuck! Wait.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Do you remember the little boy who
dialog: lived next door to you when your dad
dialog: died?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: We used to destroy small villages
dialog: together?
text: Chuck stares at him a moment... confused... then...
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Ned? Hey. How's it going?
text: She finally puts the chair down. 46... 45... 44...
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Good. You look great. Um, do you
dialog: know what's happening right now?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I had the strangest dream I was being
dialog: strangled to death with a plastic
dialog: sack.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: It wasn't a dream. You were...
dialog: strangled to death with a plastic
dialog: sack. That's probably an odd thing
dialog: to hear but I wasn't quite sure how
dialog: to sugar-coat it.
text: It takes a moment. She glances at her burial shroud, her
text: coffin and finally the viewing room filled with caskets.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Oh. Oh. And I'm...? Neat. How...?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: You only have a minute. Less. About

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Huh. What can I do in 38 seconds?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: You can tell me who killed you so,
dialog: um, you know, justice can be served.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: That is so sweet. I just wanna put
dialog: you in my pocket. But I don't know
dialog: who killed me. I went to go get ice.
dialog: I was filling my bucket and I dropped
dialog: my room key in the ice maker and
dialog: just as I was thinking that was
dialog: dumb...
scene_heading: 37 INT. CRUISE SHIP - CORRIDOR - MEMORY FLASH - VERY QUICK
speaker_heading: ACTION 37
text: CHUCK stands at the ice machine perplexed with a bucket of
text: ice under her arm. FWIP - a bag is thrown violently over her

speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Is my time up?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: And Chuck was just starting to get used to being alive again.
dialog: It's weird and sad, but all she can think to say is:
speaker_heading: CHUCK

speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Before you...
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I wanted to say I'm...
text: Staring at her, Ned can't bring himself to tell her he
dialog: inadvertently killed her father. So instead he says:
speaker_heading: NED (CONT'D)
dialog: I used to... when I lived next door
dialog: to you... I had a cru... I was in...
dialog: You were my first kiss.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (smiles, touched)
dialog: You were my first kiss, too. Or did
dialog: you think I'd been around?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I didn't want to assume.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Wanna be my last kiss? First and
dialog: last? Or is that weird?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: It's not weird. It's symmetrical.
text: 5... 4... He looks at her and slowly moves in for the kiss.
text: She closes her eyes. Their lips are about to connect when...
scene_heading: 41 INT. FUNERAL HOME - BATHROOM - DAY 41

dialog: Chuck opens her eyes. 2... 1... Minute's up.
scene_heading: 43 INT. FUNERAL HOME - BATHROOM - DAY 43
dialog: A beat, then THUNK -- we HEAR The Funeral Director's lifeless

speaker_heading: 44 RESUME - VIEWING ROOM - DAY 44
text: Ned slowly pulls away from Chuck, who lies there blinking.
dialog: He let her live and someone else died, the weight of it all
text: is clearly on Ned's face when he looks back at Chuck.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: If you don't wanna kiss me, you
dialog: don't... It was just a... I thought
dialog: it might...
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: No. I want to, I do... I... What if
dialog: you didn't have to... be dead?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Well, that would be preferable.
text: RAP-RAP-RAP, Emerson pounds on the door.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Nobody can know. I have to think
dialog: about how to get you outta here. Can
dialog: you lay really still until I get
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Uh, sure --
text: Before she can finish, he's closing the coffin lid.
scene_heading: 45 INT. FUNERAL HOME - OUTSIDE VIEWING ROOM - DAY 45

speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Someone tossed her carcass off a

speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I'm -- it's warm in there. What?
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Your eye's twitching. When people

dialog: twitches. Right there. Like yours
dialog: did, just now.
speaker_heading: NED
text: It's nerves. Aggravated by a stomach

dialog: Holy -- Oh, jeez --
text: Ned makes sure they're not looking and jumps into the grave,

speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Sorry I'm late.
scene_heading: 64 INT. PIE HOLE - NIGHT 64
text: Chuck and Ned sit at a booth, Chuck wrapped in his coat. He

text: Ned is still filthy from digging up her grave.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I can't even hug you? What if you
dialog: need a hug? A hug can turn your day
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I'm not a fan of the hug.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Then you haven't been hugged properly.
dialog: It's an emotional Heimlich. Someone
dialog: puts their arms around you, gives a
dialog: squeeze. All your fear and anxiety
dialog: comes shooting out of your mouth in
dialog: a big, wet wad and you can breath
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: That's fine for someone else to do,
dialog: if I'm choking. On something other
dialog: than emotion. But you can't touch
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: So a kiss is out of the question.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: I'm teasing. I'm teasing you.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Lost my train of thought.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: This is the most delicious pie I've

dialog: butter?

speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Never had so much in common with a
dialog: pie.
dialog: (back to point)
dialog: Why didn't you touch me twice? I
dialog: haven't seen you in 20 years.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I have a very good memory.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: How long were you thinking about
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Like thinking-thinking? It wasn't
dialog: premeditated. I wasn't lying in
dialog: wait. More like I was musing on the
dialog: idea. Not, you know, dwelling. But
dialog: I wasn't seriously considering until
dialog: the exact moment I did it. Or, um,
dialog: didn't do it.
text: Chuck stares at him a moment -- this is all overwhelming.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I always wondered if you'd come back.
dialog: I guess you came back when I needed
dialog: you most. Well, that would've been
dialog: before I was killed but this worked
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: You understand you can't go back,
dialog: right? You can't see your aunts.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: They're shut-ins, it's not like they
dialog: talk to anybody.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: People aren't used to this sort of
dialog: thing. Issues of morality and "how
dialog: come she's not dead anymore?" It'd
dialog: be a disaster.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I suppose dying is as good excuse as

speaker_heading: CHUCK

dialog: he's...?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You seem to do that a lot. Why do
dialog: you do that a lot?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: It's just the two of you. I don't

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Oh, oh, of course.
text: Ned crosses to the couch and lays down, dirt and all.
speaker_heading: NED

speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER #3
dialog: A passenger heard a commotion just

speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER #3

speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Of course. Don't be silly -- That's

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You said you wanted to know who killed
dialog: me so justice could be served. But I

speaker_heading: NED
dialog: It most certainly was an entree. It

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: When were you gonna tell me?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: In the morning or when it came up.
dialog: Which ever didn't come first.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: 100,000 dollars makes a lotta pie.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: 50 thousand. I have a business
dialog: partner.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: It's a business?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Not in the traditional sense.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You touch murder victims, ask who
dialog: killed them, touch 'em again, they
dialog: go back to being dead and you collect
dialog: the reward?
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Yeah... that's it in a nutshell.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Are you after my reward? I'm not mad
dialog: at ya, I just wanna know. I'll be
dialog: mad at ya if you lie to me, though.
dialog: Is that why you're keeping me around?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: NED

speaker_heading: EMERSON

speaker_heading: NED

speaker_heading: EMERSON

speaker_heading: CHUCK

text: Emerson can only stare. Ned buries his face in his hands.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been ruminating. And by
dialog: ruminating I mean pondering, not
dialog: chewing cud. How about we solve my
dialog: murder and collect the reward.
dialog: Wouldn't that be poetic? It's
dialog: certainly an anecdote.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: She's supposed to be in the ground.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: (to Chuck)
dialog: I thought you didn't want the reward.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: No. I wanted you not to want the
dialog: reward. 100,000 dollars is a lot of
dialog: money. How about a 3 way split?
dialog: 30/30/40? Only fair I get more. I
dialog: did die for it.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: CHUCK

speaker_heading: EMERSON

speaker_heading: NED

speaker_heading: NED

speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: I intend to profit from your
dialog: stupidity. Are you in love with

speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I'll admit to being confused. This
dialog: is a very confusing time. Childhood
dialog: issues. Diggin' in the dirt. S'all
dialog: coming up.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: We all have the childhood issues. I
dialog: got a full subscription. Horror
dialog: stories.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I kinda killed her dad when I was
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Maybe not "horror" stories.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: She doesn't know. I wanted to make
dialog: it better or different from what it
dialog: was because what it was was her dead
dialog: and I didn't want that to be my fault,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: EMERSON
dialog: Who died instead, Captain Sav'a'ho?

speaker_heading: EMERSON

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: The small town girl who never saw

dialog: who I am but I've been hoisted upon
dialog: my own petard.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: What's a petard?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: In my case, a petard is the wander-

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: This isn't either. Or maybe it's
dialog: both. But here's the deal: you get

dialog: gonna catch up. Then you're... not
dialog: talking anymore.
speaker_heading: DIEDRE
dialog: Does everybody get to do this? Cause,
dialog: girl, we got to break it down.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Did you know I was gonna get killed?
speaker_heading: DIEDRE
dialog: I thought it might be a possibility.
dialog: And I'm real sorry about that. I
