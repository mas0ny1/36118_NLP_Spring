text: -- and skillfully chops the lock with one hand. The heavy

text: Blaze throws the cutters inside, peels away --

speaker_heading: ROXANNE
speaker_heading: (TURNING BACK)

speaker_heading: ROXANNE

speaker_heading: STARKE

speaker_heading: NOMI
text: He understands. He just refuses to speak
dialog: it.
text: Laforte continues to ramble intermittently. Blaze shifts,
text: impatient, finally sits forward.
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: Listen, I don't want to be an ass-hole,
dialog: but can we just fast-forward the whole
dialog: Yoda routine?
text: The home team scores! Laforte WHOOPS wildly, loses his mask,
text: COUGHS uncontrollably. Blaze stands. He's out of there.
speaker_heading: BLAZE (CONT'D)
dialog: Feel better, old man.
speaker_heading: LAFORTE
dialog: (rasping, in English)
dialog: Give me the coin.
text: Blaze stops, cocks an eyebrow at Nomi. She shrugs. Blaze
text: hands over the coin. Laforte studies it, starts speaking in
dialog: Dakota again. Nomi translates:
speaker_heading: NOMI
dialog: The man you're looking for goes by lots
dialog: of names. Coyote, Black Dog. In Dakota,
dialog: he's Waka Sica. The Trickster. Look at
dialog: him straight on, you might see a human.
text: Look at him out of the corner of your eye
dialog: at one of the in-between times -- dusk or
dialog: dawn, you might see something else.
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: What does he want?
speaker_heading: LAFORTE
text: Wacokico. Vengeance.
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NOMI
dialog: Because it's his nature.
text: Laforte elaborates. Nomi continues to translate.
speaker_heading: NOM I (CONT' D )
dialog: Long ago, Coyote could change his shape,

speaker_heading: NOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: But Eagle, he had a clear eye. And he
dialog: saw Coyote for what he really was. So he
text: swooped down, scattered those pieces to
dialog: the winds.
dialog: (beat, drawing a breath)
dialog: The first men, they found the pieces, and
dialog: not knowing what they were, they ate
dialog: them. And that's, how all men came to
dialog: have a little piece of Coyote in their
dialog: hearts. Now Coyote, he'll promise
dialog: anything to get those pieces back.
text: There it is. Blaze exhales. He studies Laforte, those
text: ancient, wise eyes.
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: I've been looking for this man for five

speaker_heading: NOMI
dialog: My grandfather says you've been looking
dialog: in the wrong place. You need to look
text: inward. The Ghost Rider is Starke's
text: weapon. An extension of his rage. But
dialog: it can't ride people unless it has
text: something to latch onto in the first
dialog: place. You understand?
text: Blaze nods. He thinks he does. Laforte hands the coin back,
text: returns his attention to the game. But as Blaze starts to
text: rise, Laforte says one final thing:
speaker_heading: LAFORTE
dialog: Wee-cha-sha nee-shee-cha hay?
text: Nomi pauses, deciding how to phrase what the old man said.
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: What? What'd he say?
speaker_heading: NOMI
dialog: He wants to know if you're a bad man.
dialog: If the Ghost Rider turned its penance
dialog: stare on you, would you burn?

speaker_heading: NOMI
dialog: I did. But I'm red. They said they'll
dialog: "look into it". Truth is, I've had a few
dialog: run-ins with them myself.
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: Your daughter -- why does Starke want her?
text: Nomi takes a beat, looks away. Haunted, ashamed.
speaker_heading: NOMI
dialog: Because he's her father. And he wants
text: her back. Billy-Ray and the others,
dialog: they're being paid to take her to him.
text: Blaze nods. Things are falling into place now.
speaker_heading: NOMI (CONT' D )
dialog: Look, I believe things happen for a
dialog: reason. Call it fate, karma, whatever
dialog: you want -- but there's no way our paths
dialog: crossing was just blind luck. I need
dialog: your help, Blaze.
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: Just so you understand what you're
dialog: asking, this thing inside me -- I can't
dialog: control it. It just comes out. And when
dialog: it does, it's like I'm a prisoner in my
text: own body. There's no reasoning with it.
dialog: It doesn't have a conscience. It doesn't
dialog: even have a personality. It's just a --
speaker_heading: (SEARCHING)

speaker_heading: NOMI

speaker_heading: AMBROSE STARKE

scene_heading: INT. LONE STAR RENT-A-CAR - DAY
text: Windows RATTLE. The storm HOWLS. A portly rental agent, JIM
text: PETROWSKY, is closing up shop. He gathers his papers, turns
text: out the lights. A TV on the counter is on:
speaker_heading: WEATHERMAN
dialog: -- experiencing extraordinary conditions.
text: Tornadoes blanketing much of East Texas,

dialog: gusts of up to seventy miles per hour --
text: As Pecrowsky turns off the TV, we hear the door CHIME.

speaker_heading: PETROWSKY
dialog: Sorry, guy, I'm just closing up.

text: Starke fixes Petrowsky with a stern gaze.
speaker_heading: STARKE
dialog: I would like to rent a car --
dialog: (reading Petrowsky's name tag)
dialog: -- "Jim" .
text: Something in Starke's tone gives Petrowsky pause. He glances
text: to the window and the growing storm beyond. We SEE the
text: coyote out there, watching from across the way.
speaker_heading: PETROWSKY
speaker_heading: (RELENTING)
dialog: Okay, alright, have a seat.

speaker_heading: PETROWSKY
dialog: Sorry, already spoken for. How `bout a

dialog: Malibu, Ford Taurus --
text: Starke deliberates. Outside, the storm seems to grow

speaker_heading: STARKE
dialog: The Taurus, then.
speaker_heading: PETROWSKY
dialog: Great. Can I see a driver's license?
text: Starke reaches into his jacket, handing over a license.
text: Petrowsky types in the required information, trying to ignore
text: the vague feeling of uneasiness settling over him.
speaker_heading: PETROWSKY (CONT' D )
dialog: How many days do you need it for?
speaker_heading: STARKE

dialog: (off Starke' s look)
dialog: We've got three options. You can
dialog: purchase a full tank in advance, you can
dialog: fill it up yourself before you return it,
dialog: or you can have us do it, but then we
dialog: have to charge you four dollars a gallon.
text: Most people go for the tank in advance.
dialog: Less hassle.
speaker_heading: STARKE
dialog: I'll do it myself.
speaker_heading: PETROWSKY
dialog: Okey-dokey.
text: Petrowsky enters the final data, hits "PRINT". As the rental
text: agreement begins feeding out, we hear a HORN FiONK.
text: Starke turns. A mini-van has pulled up outside. A MOUSY
text: WOMAN sits behind the wheel. A BOY sits in the back seat.
text: The coyote is still there, but it pays no attention to them.
speaker_heading: STARKE
dialog: Mrs. Petrowsky?
speaker_heading: PETROWSKY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Petrowsky slides the agreement to Starke, takes out a pen:
speaker_heading: PETROWSKY (CONT' D)
dialog: Here you go. Just your standard rental
dialog: agreement. You get up to 150 miles a day
dialog: for free, twenty cents a mile after that.
dialog: If you want additional personal accident
dialog: insurance it's five dollars a day,
dialog: another nine-ninety-nine if you want the
dialog: loss/damage waiver. Your basic rental
dialog: rate, plus applicable state and local
dialog: tax. You just need to initial here,

dialog: -- and give me your John Hancock on the
dialog: line right here.
text: Petrowsky offers Starke a pen. He doesn't take it. Instead,

speaker_heading: PETROWSKY
dialog: I did?
text: Starke turns the agreement around for Petrowsky to see.
speaker_heading: PETROWSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Geez, I'm sorry, you're absolutely right.
dialog: That's the Caddy rate. Guess I entered
dialog: it in by mistake --
text: Starke looks up at Petrowsky over the rim of his bifocals,
text: the timbre of his voice taking on a decidedly frigid turn.
speaker_heading: STARKE
dialog: Were you trying to cheat me, Jim?
speaker_heading: PETROWSKY
dialog: No, no, not at all --
speaker_heading: STARKE
dialog: Then I'd like a new contract specifying
dialog: the appropriate rate.
text: Petrowsky squirms, uncomfortable. For in that pregnant

text: entire nature of the transaction seems to have changed.
speaker_heading: PETROWSKY
dialog: Look, can't we just go with the contract
dialog: we've got here? I'll make a note of it
dialog: and knock a day's rental off the total
dialog: when you return it. What do you say?
speaker_heading: STARKE

speaker_heading: RAIN'S EYES

speaker_heading: THE PEN

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY/CORNFIELD - DAY
text: The Hummer barrels off the road, SLAMS down hard into a
text: concrete culvert. Without missing a beat, Rain is out and

speaker_heading: ON RAIN,

scene_heading: ON CARRIGAN AND LANDSDALE

scene_heading: INT_ QUARRY OFFICE - DUSK

scene_heading: ANGLE ON A RAGGEDY FIGURE

text: a SCARECROW being buffeted about by the wind.
scene_heading: INT. MISSION - CHAPEL - DAY
text: Rhymer leads Blaze down the central aisle. The chapel is
text: dark, lit by candle-light, crowded with scaffolding and drop-
text: sheets. As Blaze walks, the flames of the candles bend in
text: his direction -- as if drawn by some unseen magnetic force.
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: Those men outside --
speaker_heading: RHYMER
text: Most of them are on a work-release
dialog: program. We're a halfway house for ex-
dialog: offenders. We try to get people on their

text: Blaze glances at Rain, apprehensive.
speaker_heading: RHYMER (CONT'D)
dialog: (misreading Blaze's look)
dialog: Don't worry, you're perfectly safe here.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MISSION - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - LATE AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: I know my way around a flywheel housing.
speaker_heading: RHYMER
dialog: Well I've got a generator out back that's

dialog: Mind helping me try to resuscitate it?
text: Blaze looks at him curiously.
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Blaze and Rhymer work by flashlight, tinkering with the old

speaker_heading: RHYMER
dialog: So how long have you been running?
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: RHYMER
dialog: You know what I mean. You spend as much

dialog: learn how to read a man's face.
speaker_heading: (NODDING)
dialog: You want to hand me that crescent wrench?

speaker_heading: (ELABORATING)

scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER,

speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: Listen, I appreciate what you're trying
dialog: to do, but I've never really been a come

speaker_heading: RHYMER
dialog: I wasn't talking about Jesus, I was
dialog: talking about a little healthy
dialog: introspection. Working here, staying in
dialog: one place for a while, seeing what
dialog: surfaces. I've found that people tend to
dialog: arrive on our doorstep for a reason.
dialog: Blaze considers this formidable man, a yearning moment

speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: I can't stay. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: RHYMER

speaker_heading: RHYMER
dialog: You can take the Norton.
speaker_heading: BLAZE

scene_heading: EXT. MISSION - NIGHT
text: A STORM FRONT is moving in, huge thunderheads gathering and

dialog: corroding into dust --

speaker_heading: RHYMER
text: aiming his shotgun, point-blank range! BLAM! The BLAST
text: Takes a chunk out of the Scarecrow's face.
scene_heading: INT. MISSION - THE STAIRS - THAT MOMENT

text: wave of HELLFIRE, incinerating the hounds as they leap
text: towards him, fighting his way up and up the steps --
scene_heading: INT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT
text: BLAM! Another BLAST chews apart the Scarecrow's neck. The

text: barrel of the shotgun, instantly corroding it --
text: The wave of corrosion swarms up the stock while towards
text: Rhymer's hands and he drops the gun, rolling away, scooping
text: up Rain as he runs towards the bathroom --
text: BACK TO THE SCARECROW,
text: recovering, his makeshift flesh knitting itself back together.
text: Flames kiss his body, causing sodden particles on his frame to
text: SIZZLE and POP -- but because his decayed flesh is so wet, he

scene_heading: EXT. MISSION - NIGHT

scene_heading: THE GHOST RIDER
text: At the other end of the chains. More accurately,
speaker_heading: GHOST BLAZE,

scene_heading: ON RAIN AND RHYMER
text: Desperate for escape, the flames closing in on them. There's

text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Ghost Blaze HOWLS, in agony as the Scarecrow's superior evil

dialog: Nuclear silence.
text: An instant in which Rhymer shoves Rain through the hatch --
text: An instant in which Scarecrow senses his own doom --
text: Because the Ghost Rider is back- But now he's more than the

text: And he DETONATES. An apocalyptic release that --

text: Ghost Blaze snatches up Rain, DIVES through a widening split
dialog: in the wall even as --
scene_heading: EXT. MISSION - NIGHT

speaker_heading: RAIN

text: through sheer, agony-inducing willpower. Ghost Blaze
dialog: SCREAMS, struggles --
dialog: -- and forces the Demon away,

text: the first time in years. He turns away and we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT_ MISSION GROUNDS - DAWN

scene_heading: STARKE'S CADILLAC
text: It slows to a stop at the end of the drive, ENGINE RUMBLING.
text: Dusty and bug-begrimed from its cross-country journey.

text: The driver's door opens. A hulking silhouette steps out.
text: The Beast, backlit by the fiery dawn which is just breaking
text: over the horizon. Sunlight FLARES outward, briefly blinding

speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: Guess so.
text: After a long beat:
speaker_heading: STARKE
dialog: Give me the girl and I'll lift the curse.
text: Blaze looks down at Rain. This was all he ever wanted. The
dialog: only thing that has kept him going all these years. He
text: reaches into his jacket, retrieving a crumpled pack of
text: cigarettes. Plucks one out --
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: She's all yours, Starke --
text: -- and lights it without a match, somehow conjuring the flame
text: from within himself. He takes a long drag. In the pits of
text: his eyes, something glows there -- a kind of lambent
dialog: darkness.
speaker_heading: BLAZE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- but you'll have to go through me if
dialog: you want her.

dialog: gone.
text: Beat. Rain studies Blaze, reaches for his hand.
speaker_heading: RAIN
dialog: He'll be back.
speaker_heading: BLAZE
dialog: Yeah.
text: BACK AMONGST THE SMOKING RUINS
text: We pass broken concrete, smouldering timber, a rock snake
text: constricting a mouse, an industry of beetles dissecting a
text: bird's carcass. Finally, we come to a small, deep cavity --
text: and there, tucked away in the darkness, we find --
speaker_heading: WOMAN (V.0.)
dialog: And that's how it ended. With another
text: beginning. A kind of balance struck
text: between the flame and the fury.
speaker_heading: BLAZE'S COIN
