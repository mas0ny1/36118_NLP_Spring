speaker_heading: TORMHAM,

speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: Hood. He has some four-score men

speaker_heading: TORNHAM

dialog: and it keeps going, through more
text: flesh and bone, out another back -~
text: imbedding in this tree.
dialog: (chewing on his lip)
dialog: It would take at least a 150 pound
dialog: pull to penetrate all that. And
dialog: definitely an armor-piercing bodkin --
dialog: no standard arrow could do this. And
dialog: the shooter would have to be close.
speaker_heading: GISBORNE
dialog: If you say so, Sheriff. My weapon
dialog: of choice is the sword.
speaker_heading: TORNHAM

dialog: traditional weapon. I’ve seen it
dialog: often in France, Italy and Cyprus -~-

speaker_heading: GISBORNE
text: His daughter, Marian. She sits at

dialog: “Lombard”? Was he Italian? I do
dialog: like Italian wine.
speaker_heading: LADY VOLUNTEER
speaker_heading: (moving CLOSER and CLOSER
text: to him as she speaks)
dialog: Well it was his view that God made a
dialog: most perfect selection when he chose
text: Adam’s rib for the creation of Eve.
dialog: God did not make woman from Adam’s
dialog: head, for she was not. intended to be
dialog: his ruler, nor from his feet, for she
dialog: was not intended to be his slave, but
dialog: from his side -- for she was intended
text: to be his companion and his friend.
dialog: Not to make him hollow and empty as
dialog: you claim, but complete and whole.
text: The final masterpiece of creation.
text: By now the Lady is standing smack in front of the Madman on

dialog: BLOCK THE THRUST!
text: The rest of the Inmates watch in shock and disbelief from

dialog: for the fork --

text: AND YANKS HIM OFF THE LADY AND OFF THE BED -~—
text: It's Tormham. He holds Madman Haley flailing wildly in his

dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: LADY VOLUNTEER

speaker_heading: LADY VOLUNTEER

speaker_heading: HOOD
dialog: Relax, Sheriff. From the dungeon

speaker_heading: HOOD

speaker_heading: HOOD

text: Tornham shakes his head:
speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: You were a noble. If you doubted
dialog: the fairness of the court here in
dialog: Nottingham you could have taken
dialog: your plea all the way to the King’s
dialog: Court of Justice at Westminster in
dialog: London.
text: For the first time since we met him a serious look fills
dialog: Robin Hood's face:
speaker_heading: HOOD
dialog: The courts be damned. They
dialog: administer Norman justice for those

dialog: Saxon such as myself --
dialog: {GESTURING to his Men}
dialog: o~- or one of my men is involved,

speaker_heading: TORNBAM
dialog: So you wrap your murder and robbery

speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: TORNHAM (cont'd)

speaker_heading: HOOD
dialog: Lots of Norman bleod in those veins

text: Tornham’s eyes blaze with defiance:
speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: Go ahead. Murder a helpless

dialog: from the likes of you.
text: Robin Hood flashes a rather charming grin -~
speaker_heading: HOOD
dialog: Sorry to disappoint you then...

speaker_heading: HOOD (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn’t bring you here to kill you —-

text: Robin Hood slips on his HOOD:
speaker_heading: HOOD
dialog: Yours does.
text: Robin Hood nods to a HULKING WOODSMAN »- the biggest of a

dialog: Well, by all means, good sir, a
dialog: strapping noble fellow such as
dialog: yourself comes to see my Marian at

speaker_heading: MARTAN
dialog: That‘s ridiculous. Is it my fault
dialog: that you couldn't keep up? I am
dialog: just a woman, after all.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Tell me, did you learn anything

speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: That Robin of Locksley is not the

speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: Really? He nearly killed me.
speaker_heading: MARTIAN
dialog: “Nearly,” Sheriff? Se you made a

dialog: Al.
speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: What's that you're reading?
text: Marian narrows her eyes at Tornham, caught a bit off-guard by
dialog: his interest.
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: A new telling of "Tristan and
dialog: Isolde” by a Frenchman named
dialog: Beroul.
speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: Beroul‘’s only original contribution
dialog: to the ancient tale is to have
dialog: Tristan kill Godwin with an arrow
dialog: through the eye -- the way your
dialog: fiancee would have done it.
text: Marian glares at him.
speaker_heading: MARTIAN
dialog: I haven’t gotten that far in the
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: Sorry. Didn’t mean to ruin the

text: Marian shrugs back at. hime
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: I believe the love triangle between
dialog: Six Tristan, Lady Isolde and her
dialog: husband the King is a metaphor for
dialog: our own spiritual struggle -~ the
dialog: choice between duty... and pasaion.
text: Tornham thinks on that one for a moment, then notices the
text: writing in the marging and steps closer to Marian ~-
speaker_heading: TORNEAM
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: MARTIAN
dialog: {self-consciously}
dialog: My notes. Alternate Lines,
dialog: commentaries, critiques of the
dialog: text. I myself write on occasion.
dialog: Poetry.
dialog: 48,
speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: (impregsed)
dialog: King Richard writes poetry in his

speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: Is it any good?
text: Tornham carefully weighs his answer...
speaker_heading: TORNEAM
dialog: Passable at best. But if you tell
dialog: anyone I said it’s less than genius
dialog: I'll probably be executed for
dialog: treason.
text: Marian can’t help but smile:
speaker_heading: MARTAN
dialog: So... it seems I hold your life in
dialog: my hands, Sheriff.
text: Tornham looks from Marian's words to her eyes. She looks
text: back. The silence between them grows intense -- then:
speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: My name is Robert.
dialog: {a beat)
dialog: Do you ever let anyone read your
dialog: poetry?
speaker_heading: MARIAN
dialog: No. But you must remember, most of
dialog: the people around here can’t read.
speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: What about Locksley? Can he read?
speaker_heading: MARTIAN
dialog: He reads my heart.
text: Tornham nods, thinks this over.
speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: You told me I'd be dead if he

speaker_heading: TORNHAM
dialog: Your Highness, the execution you
