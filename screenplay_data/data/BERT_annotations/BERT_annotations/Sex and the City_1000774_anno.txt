speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I know.
dialog: 19A.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: So, I put you in my "we're never

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Sorry about the extra paper work.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: You'll get my bill.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Samantha, it feels so different
dialog: this time. No cliché romantic

dialog: decision about spending their lives
dialog: together.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Well, I'm happy for you.
speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Well, who's it by? The label?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No one. I found it in a vintage

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Well, you don't also have a five

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: My point of view... Exactly. The

dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Miranda -- you're a lawyer. You can
