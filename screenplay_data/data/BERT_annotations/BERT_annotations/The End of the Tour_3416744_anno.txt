speaker_heading: 2008 - NIGHT
text: A bright, unpretentious two-bedroom in a pre-war building,
text: cluttered with books and papers, reflecting its owner’s
text: lively mind. The decor is that of a perennial grad student’s
text: digs, the bachelor pad of a New York intellectual.
text: A dog curled up on the sofa beside him, DAVID LIPSKY, a
text: boyishly handsome forty-three, quick-witted, tightly-wound,
text: smokes and types speedily from scraps of handwritten notes,
text: surrounded by books on his current journalistic subject,
text: climate change. A stack of copies of his recent publishing
text: success - Absolutely American - looms nearby.
text: His iPhone vibrates. He gets up and answers the call.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Hey, Bob, what’s up?
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
dialog: (over phone) Listen: According to
dialog: this unconfirmed report... David
text: Wallace is dead.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (disputing) What? No no no no, must
dialog: be a college prank or something...
text: Lipsky rapidly googles “david foster wallace death” and scans
dialog: the news.
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
dialog: I thought if anybody knew whether it
dialog: was true or not...
text: Shock registers on Lipsky’s face. OVER: NPR reporter ROBERT
speaker_heading: SIEGEL.
speaker_heading: ROBERT SIEGEL (0.S.)
dialog: Now a remembrance of writer David

scene_heading: INT. NPR - NYC - 2008 - DAY
text: Lipsky is being escorted to a booth by a college-age INTERN.
speaker_heading: ROBERT SIEGEL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
text: He was found dead, an apparent
text: suicide, on Friday night. Wallace's
dialog: novel, "Infinite Jest," brought him
dialog: fame and a wide audience.
scene_heading: INT. NPR - NYC - 2008 - MOMENTS LATER
text: Lipsky, wearing headphones, heart pounding, nervously waits
text: for a cue from a woman producer in the control booth.
speaker_heading: ROBERT SIEGEL (0.S.)
dialog: .--Writer David Lipsky has this
dialog: appreciation.
text: The producer signals to Lipsky, who reads his prepared

speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: “To read David Foster Wallace was to

scene_heading: EXT. BOOKSTORE - NYC - 2008 - DAY
text: Lipsky, pensive, smoking, walks down the street on a crisp

text: Lipsky rummages closet shelves until he locates a particular

text: motley bunch of audio tapes - eight or nine of them -
text: numbered, scrawled with dates from four days in March 1996.

text: Lipsky takes the batteries out of his electric toothbrush and
text: puts them in the recorder.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY (V.O.)
dialog: You didn’t slip into the books looking
dialog: for story, information, but for a
dialog: particular experience. The sensation,
dialog: for a certain number of pages, of
dialog: being David Foster Wallace.”
text: With a mixture of excitement and trepidation, he inserts
text: cassette #1 in the machine and presses play. The sound of
text: David's voice mid-tape, is both comforting and moving.
speaker_heading: DAVID’S VOICE
dialog: (on the recording) -- there was, if
dialog: anything, a conscious attempt to not
dialog: give overt direction. Although, of
dialog: course, you end up becoming yourself.

dialog: ...city-wide football as a kid. I was
dialog: real big, really strong as a kid. And

text: Lipsky stands before a paltry turnout - consisting of old
text: people and a few loyal friends (among them his pretty
text: girlfriend, SARAH) - reading from his novel, The Art Fair.
text: Here, Lipsky is 30 years old but looks like a student, his
text: long, dark, Byronic hair framing his fine features.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: - the warehouses, the old buildings,
text: the cobbled streets.
text: Distracted by disinterested CUSTOMERS who continue to browse,
text: Lipsky hears a muffled giggle and sees a YOUNG COUPLE in the
text: audience flirting and clearly not listening.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY (CONT'D)
dialog: It wasn’t the Upper East Side, and it
dialog: was dirty. I felt marooned. Our
dialog: mother had taken us off the track of
dialog: the nice life we’d been on. She’d
text: moored us in a creepy cul-de-sac with
dialog: her art-world friends.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. KGB BAR - NYC - 1996 - NIGHT 14
text: Deafening music. A crowded, noisy gathering of mostly young,
text: cool, black-attired New York writers and artists.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY (V.O.) (CONTD)
dialog: None of the kids in my school had
dialog: parents in the art world. It made me
dialog: feel different. Like there was
dialog: something I had to cover up.”
text: Lipsky gets two glasses of wine from a bar. We FOLLOW as he
text: makes his way through the crowd. He knows a lot of people
text: with whom he exchanges ad-libbed greetings along the way.
text: They have to SHOUT to be heard above the din.

speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY
dialog: David, hi! How'd your reading go?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY

speaker_heading: BEARDED GUY

speaker_heading: SARAH'S FRIEND
dialog: Did you see Kirn’s review in New York

scene_heading: INT. LIPSKY’S W 77TH ST APT/BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NYC - 1996 - 15
speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: Lipsky, at the bathroom door, reads aloud Walter Kirn’s
text: review in New York magazine (2/12/96). Sarah comes out in a
text: towel and he follows her to the bedroom.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: “Next year’s book awards have been
dialog: decided.” Can you believe this? “The

dialog: It’s as though Paul Bunyan had joined

dialog: paragraph!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What if it actually is that good? You
dialog: know? You may just have to read it.
scene_heading: INT. LIPSKY’S W 77TH ST APT/LIVING ROOM - NYC - 1996 - DUSK 16
dialog: If his 2008 place is grad-student-y, the 1996 Lipsky
text: residence is smaller and explosively chaotic, like a
text: teenager’s domain. We find Sarah on the couch reading the
dialog: current bestseller, Primary Colors and Lipsky beside her
text: reading Infinite Jest. Silence.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE/CUBICLES/BOB'S OFFICE - NYC - 17
speaker_heading: 1996 - DAY
text: Buzzing with the hip, youthful industry of people who know
text: they’re at the place to be. Lipsky drops by to see his
text: editor, BOB LEVIN, 40, greying, bearded.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: How many times have we interviewed a
dialog: writer in the last ten years? Guess.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Um... how many?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Zero. I checked.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Maybe that’s because Rolling Stone
dialog: doesn’t interview writers.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: There hasn't been a writer like this
dialog: one. Once in a generation, maybe.
dialog: Hemingway, Pynchon. Let me have this
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What story?

text: Lipsky tosses Newsweek, opened to a photo of Wallace, onto
text: Bob’s messy desk.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: He’s finishing up his book tour and I
dialog: want to go with him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That’s not a story.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: He teaches at some small state
text: university, somewhere in Illinois.
dialog: Send me there. Please, Bob. This is
dialog: the sort of stuff I should be doing,
dialog: not 500-words on boy bands. Talk to
dialog: Jann?
scene_heading: INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE/LIPSKY'S CUBICLE - NYC - 1996 - I7A
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Lipsky works at his computer. Newsweek with the Wallace
text: photo lands on his desk. Lipsky looks up and sees Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: There had better be a story there...
text: Bob leaves.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (calls) There will be!
text: His smile fades. Now what?
scene_heading: INT. LIPSKY'S W 77TH ST APT/LIVING ROOM - NYC - 1996 - NIGHT 18
text: Sarah reads her own copy of Infinite Jest as Lipsky walks
text: back and forth across frame, gathering stuff to pack for his
dialog: trip. Laptop. Notebook. Wallace's books, full of notations
text: and post-its. Tape recorder, packs of audio cassettes. He
text: considers then tosses in The Art Fair and zips up his bag.
scene_heading: EXT. LIPSKY'S W 77TH ST APT - NYC - 1996 - MORNING 20
text: A grey wintry morning. Lipsky, outside his building, hails a
dialog: taxi.
scene_heading: I/E. CAB/FDR DRIVE - NYC - 1996 - MORNING 21
text: Lipsky, in the backseat, reads Infinite Jest; he’s about
text: three-quarters of the way through it. He makes a note in the

dialog: telephone conversations.)
speaker_heading: DAVID’S VOICE
dialog: (over phone) Hello?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: David, hi, it’s David Lipsky.
speaker_heading: DAVID’S VOICE
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I think I may have made a wrong turn
dialog: somewhere. Let’s see, I’m on County
dialog: Highway 29, across from Circus Video?
speaker_heading: DAVID’S VOICE
dialog: How'd you get this number?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Your publicist sent it in her e-mail,
dialog: just in case.
speaker_heading: DAVID’S VOICE
dialog: You'd do me a favor by losing it.
scene_heading: I/E. CAR/DAVID'S STREET - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - DAY 27
text: Stormy skies. Flat, wintry terrain. As the car pulls up,
text: Lipsky sees, through the windshield, a modest, one-story
text: brick house in the distance, and a man emerging from it.
text: From Lipsky’s long shot POV: DAVID FOSTER WALLACE, hands
text: shoved in his jeans pockets for warmth, accompanied by his
text: two barking, rambunctious black labs, JEEVES and DRONE.
text: Lipsky parks. He takes a deep, bracing breath before getting
text: out of the car to finally meet the man about whom he has
text: complicated feelings. He walks toward him.
text: This is the first time we see David up close and in focus:
text: stubble, long hair, blue bandanna, wire-rims, Frye boots,
text: 6'2” and, at this time in his life, burly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You made it.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yeah. Hi.
text: David offers his wary, tolerant hand. This being the end of
text: his tour, his patience is frayed and he’s just about talked
dialog: out. But, at the same time, it’s Rolling Stone, he wants to
dialog: make a good impression.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Dave. Dave Wallace.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: David Lipsky. Pleasure.
text: Lipsky is cowed but determined to hold his own. These are
text: two really smart, competitive guys out to impress each other.
dialog: Wallace wants to be favorably profiled and Lipsky wants
dialog: Wallace’s approval - and a good story.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Sorry about the phone call.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: 95% joke.
text: Lipsky laughs.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONTD)
dialog: Sorry in advance about the dogs, gonna
dialog: be slobbering all over you.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Oh, I don’t mind. I love dogs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah? Well, you haven’t met these
dialog: guys... It’s cold, let’s go inside.
dialog: (to the dogs) Jeeves, Drone! Get over
dialog: here!

dialog: house.
dialog: 28
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - 1996 - CONTINUOUS 28
text: Lipsky drops his bag on the messy, shit-stained shag carpet.
text: The dogs are indeed all over him. Lipsky scratches their
text: heads and speaks to them as a dog lover would speak to dogs.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yes, I’m very glad to meet you, too.
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That’s Jeeves. The Jeevesmeister. I
dialog: got him ‘cause he was so ugly. No one
dialog: else wanted him. Now he’s like a
dialog: Cover Girl-dog. Aren't you, Jeeves?
dialog: Yes, you are. And this is Drone. My
dialog: provisional dog.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why provisional?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just showed up one day while Jeeves
dialog: and I were out jogging and the rest is
dialog: history.
dialog: (A beat.)
dialog: I feel like I should offer you tea or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yeah. Thanks. That would be great.
text: David goes to put on water. We STAY on Lipsky, casually
text: studying the room with the eye of a journalist, taking in the
text: grad-student-like accoutrements: cramped cinder-block
text: bookshelves; hodgepodge of furniture, an ALANIS MORISSETTE
text: POSTER conspicuously on the wall. Lipsky, glancing out the
text: window at the wintry landscape, raises his voice to converse
text: with David, who’s in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Nice view.
speaker_heading: DAVID (0.S.)
dialog: Thank you. I can’t take credit for it.
text: Lipsky smiles. Pause.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: So... Have you always been unlisted?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (from the kitchen) I had to do that
dialog: recently. It was getting crazy.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Because of fans?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t know if “fan” would be the
dialog: right word... I think what happened
dialog: was, I had forgotten to tell my
dialog: parents not to give my number out. So
dialog: it was people who tracked my parents
dialog: down, and um -
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (knowing) Ohhh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I have this terrible problem, I just
dialog: really hate to hurt people’s feelings.
dialog: So I did something kinda cowardly.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Unlisting your number’s not cowardly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It kinda is. I mean, I changed my
dialog: number so these folks couldn’t find me
dialog: anymore. There was this computer
dialog: operator in Vancouver, lived in a
dialog: basement. Who I found really moving.
text: In terrible terrible pain.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What did he want from you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wasn’t clear, and when I would sort of
dialog: ask him, he’d get angry, and that’s
dialog: when it got scary.
text: Lipsky sees a child’s drawing displayed on the fridge:
dialog: “Chickenhead Dave Wallace.”
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (re: the drawing) Who’s the artist?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hm? (Lipsky points.) Oh, my friend's
dialog: daughter. Calls me Chickenhead, and I
dialog: call her Chickenhead. Her latest
dialog: salvo in the war.
text: Laughing, Lipsky takes out his tape recorder and starts to
text: set it up but stops. (Lipsky is a nervous laugher; he laughs
dialog: a_lot, not only where indicated.)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You mind if I...?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey. Do what you’ve got to do.
text: David watches uncomfortably. The ever-present tape recorder
text: becomes a third character in this conversation.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen: Before we start putting stuff
dialog: on tape, I gotta ask you something.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I need to know that anything that I
dialog: ask you five minutes later to not put
dialog: in, you won’t put in.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Absolutely.
text: He clicks off the recorder.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Given my level of fatigue and fuck-up
dialog: quotient lately, it’s the only way I
dialog: can see doin’ it and not going crazy.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I understand completely.
text: Lipsky presses play.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Right back on, huh.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You agreed to the interview.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, I do, very much, that’s what’s
dialog: so fucked, I feel so bad for these
dialog: kids.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why do you feel bad them, they have
dialog: the best writing teacher in the world.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If I were there, maybe. The whole
dialog: fuss has taken me out of school for
dialog: the past two weeks and I’m gonna have
dialog: to leave again tomorrow. We've got to
text: get up at the crack of dawn to leave
dialog: for the airport, by the way.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Oh, shit, do we really?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's what you signed on for, man.
dialog: You're welcome to stick around, write
dialog: an article about my dogs. Might be
dialog: more interesting, I promise you.

scene_heading: INT. ISU CAMPUS/CLASSROOM - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - LATER 31A
text: The class in-progress. Lipsky observes as David paces. He’s
text: “on” and his students are eating it up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A campus romance story, I gotta tell
dialog: ya, to the average citizen, is not all
dialog: that interesting. The great dread of

text: Laughter.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: EARNEST STUDENT
dialog: I just want my narrator to be funny
dialog: and smart, y'know?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know. You want your narrator to be
dialog: funny and smart. Here’s a tip, then:
dialog: Have him say funny, smart things some
dialog: of the time.
text: Laughter. Lipsky jots down a note.

speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: ..-And what can I get you to drink?
dialog: Beer, Or...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Uh, not for me, thanks. A large Diet
dialog: Rite.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I‘ll have the same.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: I'll be right back with your pop.
text: The waiter goes. Lipsky sets up the tape recorder.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You don’t drink.
text: David doesn’t answer right away.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is that a question?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: It’s an observation.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah. I see. No; I do not drink. You
dialog: can order whatever you want, go right
dialog: ahead.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: That’s all right. My friends who have
dialog: been through the program say they
dialog: didn't want people to drink in front
dialog: of them, so out of respect...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not any sort of authority on any
dialog: sort of “program.” But from my very
dialog: limited outside understanding, people
dialog: who have been in it for a while: you
dialog: could snort cocaine off the back of
dialog: your hand and they’re okay.
text: Lipsky is embarrassed for having been presumptuous.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know what I would love to do?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I would love to do a profile of one of
dialog: you guys who’s doin’ a profile of me.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: That is interesting...

dialog: Pause.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Too po-mo and cute?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Maybe, for Rolling Stone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But it would be interesting.
dialog: (A beat.)
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's just, you’re gonna go back to New
dialog: York and sit at your desk and shape
dialog: this thing however you want. And that
dialog: to me is extremely disturbing.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why is it disturbing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ‘Cause I would like to shape the
dialog: impression of me that’s coming across.
dialog: I can’t even tell if I like you yet
dialog: ‘cause I’m too worried whether you
dialog: like me.
text: Before Lipsky can assure him, the waiter brings their sodas.

speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: We’re fine, thanks.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So what's this piece about? What does
dialog: “Jann” want?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What’s it like being the most-talked
dialog: about writer in the country. That
dialog: sort of thing. That sounds so --
text: Lipsky seems embarrassed as soon as he says the words.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How do you learn to do this stuff?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Interviewing. Did you go to
dialog: interviewing school?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: No... I, uh...
text: A beat. Lipsky feels a tad fraudulent to identify himself as
text: a writer to the man whose success and talent he envies.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I'm a writer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, yeah?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I mean I write fiction. Just published
dialog: my first novel, as a matter of fact.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What’s it called?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: The Art Fair?
text: David shrugs. He’s never heard of it. Lipsky feels foolish
dialog: for having brought it up.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: And I, uh, had a collection published,
dialog: a couple of years ago.
text: Lipsky’s pumping leg betrays his anxiety. David notices.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're a nervous guy, aren’t you?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: No no I’m okay. How are you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ‘Cause I’m terrified.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Are you? I think it’s going to be a
dialog: lot of fun.
dialog: 18.

text: The food is decimated. David is loosening up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The thing about this tour is... I
dialog: would like to get laid out of ita
dialog: couple of times, but... Like, people
text: come up, they kinda slither up during
dialog: readings or whatever. But it seems
dialog: like, what I want is not to have to
dialog: take any action.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Like...?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Like, I don’t want to have to say,
dialog: “Would you like to come back to my
dialog: hotel?” I want them to say, “I am
dialog: coming back to the hotel. Where is
dialog: your hotel?”
text: Lipsky laughs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can’t stand to look like I’m
dialog: actively trading on this sexually.
dialog: Which of course I would be happy to
dialog: do. In retrospect, it was lucky that
dialog: I didn’t.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Basically, it just would have made me
dialog: feel lonely.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why lonely?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because it wouldn’t have had anything
dialog: to do with me, it would have just
dialog: been...
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Your fame?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. Whatever.
dialog: 34
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You're famous. You can say that.
dialog: Except... if they’re responding to
dialog: your work, and the work is so
dialog: personal... then trading on it is
dialog: actually another way of meeting you,
dialog: isn’t that right?
text: A beat. David is impressed by Lipsky’s analysis.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That is so good.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This piece’ll really be good if it’s
dialog: mostly you. Talk all you want, man,
dialog: save me a whole lotta trouble.
text: Lipsky laughs, sensing his stock has risen, relaxing more
text: into the rhythm of their conversation.
scene_heading: I/E. CAR/COMMERCIAL DRAG - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - NIGHT 34
text: David at the wheel, driving Lipsky’s rental. Lights from
text: fast-food restaurant signs light up their faces. Tape
dialog: running.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So this is what a real car feels like.
dialog: The one I have is like riding a power
text: lawn mower.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You think being handsome has anything
dialog: to do with your success?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (incredulously) What?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You are photogenic... You look good in
dialog: your author’s photo.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You'd have to come put me down if I
dialog: even start thinking that way.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Thinking what way? About how books
dialog: are sold?
dialog: 35
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Like, “Do you want to do a Rolling
dialog: Stone interview, do you want to do xX,
dialog: do you want to do Y” worries me that
dialog: what I’m doing right now is being a
dialog: whore.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: A whore? Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know, cashing in somehow, or
dialog: getting some little celebrity for
dialog: myself. That will, from some bizarre
dialog: set of misunderstandings, sell more
text: copies of the book.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can quote that. Preferably ina
dialog: context where I don’t sound like a
dialog: total dweeb.
dialog: (A beat.)
dialog: By the way, are they gonna send Annie
dialog: Leibovitz to take pictures?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I’m not sure. Possibly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know: You’re a good-looking guy. We
dialog: should have ‘em photograph you, and
dialog: say you're me. Maybe I’1l finally end
text: up getting laid.
text: Lipsky laughs.

speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Let me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You don’t have to pay for my shit.
dialog: 36
dialog: 37
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: It’s not coming out of my pocket...
dialog: I've got an expense account.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All right, if you insist...
text: David goes back for more.
scene_heading: INT. CAR/COMMERCIAL DRAG - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - NIGHT 36
text: Riding through town, the Davids are eating candy like
text: teenagers on a joyride.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If you ate this stuff all the time,
dialog: what would be wrong with that?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Except for your teeth falling out and
dialog: getting really fat?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, it doesn’t have any of the
dialog: nourishment of real food, but it’s
dialog: real pleasurable masticating and
dialog: swallowing this stuff.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Like seductive commercial
dialog: entertainment.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Exactly, and what saves us is that
dialog: most commercial entertainment isn’t
dialog: very good.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What about good seductive commercial
dialog: entertainment - like Die Hard?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The first Die Hard? Great film.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Brilliant, right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The best.
scene_heading: EXT. DAVID’S HOUSE - 1996 - NIGHT 37
text: The car pulls up, parks. They get out with the spoils from
dialog: the 7-Eleven. Mid-discourse:
dialog: 38
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So if the book’s about anything, it’s
dialog: about the question of: Why am I
dialog: watching all this shit? It’s not
dialog: about the shit, it’s about me. Why am
dialog: I doing it? And what’s so American
dialog: about what I’m doing?
text: We hear the dogs barking as David unlocks the door and they
text: enter the house.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - 1996 - CONTINUOUS 38
text: The dogs run out to do their thing. David puts away the soda
dialog: and snacks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The minute I start talking about this
dialog: stuff, it sounds, number one: very
dialog: vague. And, two: really reductive.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I don’t think you’re being reductive
dialog: or vague at all.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because it’s like, I don’t have a
dialog: diagnosis, a system of prescriptions.
dialog: You know? Like, why are we - and by
dialog: “we” I mean people like you and me:
dialog: mostly white, upper middle class,
dialog: obscenely well-educated, doing really
dialog: interesting jobs, sitting in really
dialog: expensive chairs, watching the best,
dialog: most sophisticated electronic
dialog: equipment money can buy - why do we
dialog: feel empty and unhappy?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Kinda like Hamlet. With channel-
dialog: surfing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m not saying TV is bad or a waste of
dialog: your time. Any more than, you know,
dialog: Masturbation is bad or a waste of your
dialog: time. It's a pleasurable way to spend
dialog: a few minutes. But if you're doing it
dialog: twenty times a day, if your primary
dialog: sexual relationship is with your own
dialog: hand, then there's something wrong.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: At least with masturbation, some
dialog: action has been performed, though,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All right, you could make me look like
dialog: a real dick if you print this: Yes,
dialog: you're performing muscular movements
dialog: with your hand as you're jerking off.
dialog: But what you're doing is running a
dialog: movie in your head, and having a
dialog: fantasy relationship with somebody who
dialog: isn't real, in order to stimulate a
dialog: purely neurological response.
dialog: Look: as the Internet grows in the
dialog: next ten, fifteen years, and virtual
dialog: reality pornography becomes a reality,
dialog: we're gonna have to develop some
dialog: machinery, inside our guts, to help us
text: turn off pure, unalloyed pleasure.
dialog: Otherwise, I don’t know about you, but
dialog: I’m gonna have to leave the planet.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (smiles uncertainly) Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because the technology is just gonna
dialog: get better and better. And it's gonna
dialog: get easier and easier, and more and
dialog: more convenient, and more and more
dialog: pleasurable, to be alone with images
dialog: on a screen, given to us by people who
dialog: do not love us but want our money.
dialog: Which is fine. In low doses. But if
dialog: that's the basic main staple of your
dialog: diet? You're gonna die. Ina
dialog: meaningful way, you're going to die.
text: Lipsky mulls over the gravity of what David has
text: said. David breaks the portentous silence when he pops a wad
text: of tobacco in his mouth.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Can I try that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Be my guest. It takes some getting
dialog: used to.
text: Lipsky tries it and makes a horrible face. David laughs.
dialog: 39
dialog: 40
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You mind if I use your uh...
text: Amused, David points the way to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I believe it’s unoccupied.
text: Lipsky goes, leaving the tape running.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/BATHROOM - 1996 - CONTINUOUS 39
text: Lipsky spits the tobacco into the sink. He cups his hands
text: under the running water and rinses his mouth. He looks at
text: himself in the mirror and takes a deep, fortifying breath.
text: He stealthily opens the medicine cabinet and finds it stocked
text: with jars of vitamins, Stri-Dex pads and tubes of Topol,
text: toothpaste for smokers. He jots down notes.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - 1996 - MOMENTS LATER 40
text: Lipsky returns, looks around. David is playing with his
dialog: dogs.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Do you not have a TV?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I do not have a TV.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ‘Cause if I had a TV, I'd watch it all
dialog: the time. I don’t even know if I would
dialog: watch it; it would be on all the time -
dialog: my version of a fireplace. A source
text: of warmth and light in the corner that
dialog: I would occasionally get sucked into.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Did you watch a lot of T.V. when you
dialog: were a kid?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. A lot. You?
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Me? Yeah, I did. I moved in with a
dialog: woman who grew up without a
dialog: television, and living with her, the
dialog: first month was torture, and then I
dialog: realized it was probably the best
dialog: thing for me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did you guys stay together?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: It’s complicated.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I was seeing this woman, then she
dialog: moved to L.A. and we theoretically
dialog: broke up. And I started seeing this
dialog: other woman, but then I started seeing
dialog: the first woman again - trying the bi-
dialog: coastal thing - and the second...
dialog: Well, let’s just say she hasn’t taken
dialog: it very well.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s so much easier having dogs. You
dialog: don’t get laid; but you also don’t get
dialog: the feeling you’re hurting their
dialog: feelings all the time. I emphasize:
dialog: strictly platonic relationship with
dialog: the dogs.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You're not dating anyone?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Seriously dating? No. I’m out of
dialog: practice; I wouldn’t know what to say.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You want to have kids?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, I think someday I do; do you?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yeah. Eventually. I think.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Writing books is kinda like raising
dialog: children, but you gotta be careful:
dialog: you should take pride in the work but
dialog: it’s bad to want that glory to reflect
dialog: back on you.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You worry about having children?
text: David seems far away; this is difficult for him. After a
text: beat, he speaks, sounding vulnerable, which doesn’t go
text: unnoticed by Lipsky.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t know that I want to say
dialog: anything more about it - okay?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (prepared to back off) That’s fine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I mean, we can joke about getting laid
dialog: on tour and stuff, but...
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I just thought, it’d be nice to have
dialog: someone to be sharing all this
dialog: wonderful stuff with.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. I really have wished I was
dialog: married, the last couple of weeks.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You have?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, because nobody quite gets it.
dialog: Your friends who aren't in the writing
dialog: biz are all just awed by your picture
dialog: in Time, and your agent and editor are
dialog: good people, but they have their own
dialog: agendas. It’s fun talking to you
dialog: about it, but you've got an agenda,
dialog: too, and a set of interests that
text: diverges from mine.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: That’s true...
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There’s something nice about having
dialog: somebody who kinda shared your life,
dialog: and that you could allow yourself just
dialog: to be happy and confused with.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Somebody you can call when you get
text: back to the hotel.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Uh huh. (A beat.) So, why aren’t you
dialog: married at thirty?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why aren't you married at thirty-four?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You first.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Okay. Um... I think it's hard to cast
dialog: that role .. to fill it when you know
dialog: it's for thirty or forty years ..
dialog: someone who, whatever mental landscape
dialog: you're in, they're going to be in it
dialog: too, you need someone who'll fit any
dialog: landscape you can imagine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I can't put it as well as you
dialog: did about the “mental landscapes,” I
dialog: just know I'm hard to be around.
text: David's “mental landscapes” reference: competitive, fawning,
text: mocking? Lipsky isn’t sure.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because when I want to be by myself,
dialog: like to work, I really want to be by
dialog: myself. I think if you dedicate
dialog: yourself to anything, one facet of
dialog: that is that it makes you very very
dialog: self-conscious. You end up using
dialog: people. Wanting them around when you
dialog: want them around, but then sending
dialog: them away.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Comes with the territory, though,
dialog: doesn’t it? Self-consciousness?
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There’s good self-consciousness. And
dialog: then there’s this toxic, paralyzing,
dialog: raped-by-psychic-Bedouins self-
dialog: consciousness.
text: Lipsky laughs.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (re: Alanis poster)
dialog: Can you do me a favor? Can you tell
dialog: me about that poster over there?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alanis? I don’t know, I guess I'm
dialog: susceptible like everybody else. Why?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: She's pretty, alright...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, but in a very sloppy, very human
dialog: way. That squeaky, orgasmic quality
dialog: in her voice? Here’s what it is: A
dialog: lot of women in magazines are pretty
dialog: in a way that isn’t erotic because
dialog: they don’t look like anybody you know.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: True.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can’t imagine them putting a
dialog: quarter in a parking meter or eating a
dialog: bologna sandwich. But her, I don't
dialog: know, I just find her absolutely
text: riveting.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: How'd you get to know her, her music,
dialog: I mean?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Listening to cheesy Bloomington radio,
dialog: and “I Want to Tell You” came on.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (correcting him) “You Oughta Know.”
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: “I Want to Tell You” is the book 0.J.
dialog: Simpson wrote.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, right.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Wouldn't it be great if O.J. Simpson
dialog: sang “You Oughta Know” and Alanis
dialog: Morissette wrote a book about not
dialog: killing two people?
text: They laugh. Lipsky is pleased to make David laugh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If somehow this whole fuss could get
dialog: me even like a five-minute cup of tea
dialog: with her...
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why don’t you put out feelers, see if
dialog: she'd be willing to meet you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You serious? I would never do that.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'd be too terrified. Why, you would
dialog: do that?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: If I were you? Why not?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A date with Alanis Morissette? What
dialog: would I say to her? “Hello, Miss
dialog: Morissette. What is it like to be
dialog: you?” (gruff voice) “I don’t know -—
dialog: shut up. And get the fuck away from
dialog: me.”
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: But you’d go if she called? “Hey,
dialog: Dave. I’m at the Drake in Chicago.
dialog: Let’s have that tea.”
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah... except this is gonna look
dialog: ridiculous: like I’m using Rolling
dialog: Stone as a vehicle to, like -
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: It’s been used for worse.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, I would do it. I’d go ina
dialog: heartbeat.
text: As Lipsky cracks up, David paints the picture:
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Perspiring heavily, all the way up
text: there, shoving Certs into my mouth.
dialog: Goin’ nuts. It would cost me like a
dialog: week of absolute trauma. But yeah, I
dialog: would do it in a heartbeat.
text: David realizes the late hour.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I like... I like talking to you
dialog: but we have to get up real early.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What is it, like ten o'clock?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s eleven-thirty, dickbrain.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Shit...I am so sorry, I completely
dialog: lost track of time. When should I
dialog: pick you up in the morning?
text: Lipsky gets his coat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Motel. There was like a Days Inn on
dialog: the main road. I thought I’d -
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (overlap) No no you don’t want to
dialog: stay there - trust me. I’ve gota
dialog: guest-roomish place you can crash in.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You sure? I don’t want to impose...

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let me get this shit out of the way...
dialog: Hm. (re: the rumpled sheet) Might be
dialog: a good idea to change that.
text: Together, they put on a clean sheet. When they’re done:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Uh, leave the door open for the dogs.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Oh, okay.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They like to wander from room to room
dialog: during the night; if the door’s
dialog: closed, they'll eat it to get through

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ..-There’s a Mitsubishi plant, and
dialog: then there’s a lot of farm-support

speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What are you doing here? I mean, why

speaker_heading: DAVID

text: enormous hiss of egos at various
text: stages of inflation and deflation.
dialog: It’s me-me-me.
text: Lipsky takes out his tape recorder.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: So, I gotta ask: What’s with the
dialog: bandanna?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: People think it’s a way you’re trying
dialog: to connect with the younger reading
dialog: audience.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is that what people think? I don’t
dialog: know many Gen-Xers who wear ‘em.
dialog: Jeez. I don’t know what to say. I
dialog: guess I wish you hadn’t brought this
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because now I’m worrying that it’s
dialog: going to seem intentional. Like if I
dialog: don't wear it, am I not wearing it
dialog: because I’m bowing to other people’s
dialog: perception that it’s a commercial
dialog: choice? Or do I do what I want, even
dialog: though it’s perceived as commercial -—
dialog: and it’s just like one more crazy
dialog: circle to go around.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Sorry. When did you start wearing
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: In Tuscon. It was a hundred degrees
dialog: all the time. I would perspire so
dialog: much... I would drip into the electric
dialog: typewriter, I was nervous I was gonna
dialog: give myself a shock. And then I
dialog: discovered that I felt better with
dialog: them on.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know it’s a security blanket for me -
dialog: whenever I’m nervous. Or feel like I
dialog: have to keep myself together. It
dialog: makes me feel kinda creepy that people
dialog: view it as an affectation or a
dialog: trademark or something. It’s more of
dialog: a foible, the recognition of a
dialog: weakness, that I’m kinda afraid my
dialog: head’s gonna explode.

dialog: Me? My dad’s in advertising, my mom’s
dialog: a painter. When they split up, I
dialog: lived with my mother in SoHo and my
dialog: brother moved in with my dad.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sounds like there’s a story there.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: There is; I just wrote it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So what was that like, your family
dialog: divided that way?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Hey, who’s interviewing whom? How old
dialog: were you when you started writing
dialog: fiction?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Twenty-one?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Never before?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think I started a World War Two
dialog: novel when I was nine.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: A bunch of people with strangely
dialog: hyperdeveloped skills and powers, who
dialog: are going to invade Hitler's bunker.
dialog: Then, in college, I wrote a couple of
dialog: papers for other people.
dialog: 52
dialog: 53
speaker_heading: 56B
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: They were paying you to write their
dialog: papers?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I wouldn't put it that coarsely.
dialog: But let's say there were complicated
dialog: systems of reward. I’d read two or
dialog: three of their papers to learn, you
dialog: know, what their music sounded like.
dialog: And I remember thinking, “Man, I'm
dialog: really good at this. I'm a weird kind
dialog: of forger. I mean, I can sound kind of
dialog: like anybody.”
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Odds are I’m gonna want to talk to
dialog: your parents.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Biographical stuff.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I hereby request that you don’t.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Oh. Okay.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They're real private people, and I
dialog: would have a hard time with it. So, no
dialog: you may not.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (backing off) Okay. I may not.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Crap jobs? Let’s see: I was a security
dialog: guard for this software company for
dialog: three and a half months.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I had to wear this polyester uniform,
dialog: and walk under these fluorescent
text: lights, twirlin’ my baton, checking in
dialog: every ten minutes: [mimes a walkie-
dialog: talkie] “All clear at this cubicle!”
dialog: Like, every bad '60s novel about
dialog: meaningless authority.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: And were you thinking, “My God, I had
dialog: two books come out when I was in my
dialog: early twenties and here I am...”?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. As a matter of fact, one reason I
dialog: liked that job is, I walked around not
dialog: thinking. In a really like, “Huh:
dialog: there's a ceiling tile.”
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: And after the security guard thing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This is the worst: I worked as a towel
dialog: boy at this chichi health club.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: A “towel boy?”
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They called me something other than a
dialog: towel boy, but I was in effect a towel
dialog: boy. Who every once in a while was
dialog: entrusted with the job of checking
dialog: people in, having them show their i.d?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Anyway, I'm sitting there, and who
dialog: should walk in to get their towel, but
dialog: this guy, this writer I knew.
dialog: 37.
dialog: Who received a Whiting Writer's Award
dialog: the same year I had, like two years
dialog: earlier.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Oh, shit...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So I see this guy that I'd been up on
dialog: this fucking rostrum with, having
dialog: Eudora Welty give us this prize -
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Oh, God!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: - And two years later, I'm like .. It's
dialog: the only time I've literally dived
dialog: under something, to have somebody
dialog: avoid seeing me.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Did you think you were done then?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. I was pretty sure life was over.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: This is after your suicide watch?
text: David blinks. A beat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How’d you know about that?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I read it somewhere. McLean's, right?
dialog: How long were you there?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Eight days, I think.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why were you there?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mostly 'cause I was scared I would do
dialog: something stupid. I had a friend from
dialog: high school who tried to kill himself
text: by sitting in a garage with the car
dialog: runnin'. And what it turned out was,
dialog: he didn't die, but it really fucked up
dialog: his brain.
dialog: 38.
dialog: And I knew, that if anybody was fated
dialog: to fuck up a suicide attempt, it was
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: So there you are still in your
dialog: twenties...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My late twenties.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Your late twenties, somewhat in pain
dialog: about your desire to become a sort of
dialog: successful literary person.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think probably the not very
dialog: sophisticated diagnosis is that I was
dialog: depressed. 'Cause by this time, my
dialog: ego's all invested in the writing.
dialog: It's the only thing that I've gotten,
dialog: you know, food pellets from the
dialog: universe for. So I felt really
dialog: trapped: Like, “Uh-oh, my five years
dialog: is up. I've gotta move on, but I don't
dialog: want to move on.” I was really stuck.
dialog: And drinking was part of that. But it
dialog: wasn't that I was stuck because I
dialog: drank. It was like, I really sort of
dialog: felt like my life was over at twenty-
dialog: eight. And that felt really bad, and I
dialog: didn't wanna feel it. So I would do
dialog: all kinds of things: I mean, I would
dialog: drink real heavy, I would like fuck
dialog: strangers. Oh, God -- Or, then, for
dialog: two weeks I wouldn't drink, and I'd
dialog: run ten miles every morning, in a
dialog: desperate, like very American, “I will
dialog: fix this somehow, by taking radical
dialog: action” sort of thing.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY

speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Do you want me to stop?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, no.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Everybody who comes here, the first
dialog: thing they want to see is “where did

dialog: You sure you don’t want me to stop?
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She wrote me a fan letter.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I did, I was the books editor at City

dialog: that’s right.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Julie has worked with a whole lot of
dialog: writers -
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: So I’m discriminating.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Exactly. And we discovered that we

dialog: people.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Indeed.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: David? Escort’s waiting. We gotta go.
text: David, still in boxers and Chicago Cubs t-shirt, frazzled,
text: opens the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sorry, man. Got totally lost in an
dialog: orgy of crap.
text: David ducks into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: A simultaneous broadcast of Falcon
text: Crest, Magnum P.I., and Charlie's
dialog: Angels: A perfect storm of shit. Out

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAY
text: A pretty PRODUCTION ASSISTANT greets David and Lipsky.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hi. Dave. Dave Wallace.
dialog: P.A.
dialog: (blushes )
dialog: I know who you are.
text: David introduces Lipsky.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My amanuensis, Mr. Boswell.
text: The P.A. shakes Lipsky’s hand, playing along with the joke.
dialog: P.A.
dialog: (in greeting)
dialog: “Mr. Boswell.” Right this way.
text: She leads David, followed by Lipsky, down a corridor past
text: glass-walled studios. Lipsky sees people recognize David,
text: whisper among themselves. Young women smile shyly, excited
dialog: to be in the presence of a cool celebrity.
dialog: P.A.
dialog: We record digitally. I hope that’s OK.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So only yes or no answers?
text: She rolls her eyes. Lipsky laughs, David sees him scribble
text: in his pad.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If you do a really mean job, I have
dialog: twenty years to get you back.
dialog: Remember that.
scene_heading: INT. MINNESOTA PUBLIC RADIO/NPR STUDIO - 1996 - DAY T6A
text: The interview goes on the air. Lipsky observes from outside
text: the booth. The NPR GUY has a good radio voice.
speaker_heading: NPR GUY
dialog: My guest today is David Foster
text: Wallace, who has burst on the literary
text: scene with his 1,079-page, three-pound-
dialog: three-ounce novel, Infinite Jest.
dialog: 54.
dialog: Jay McInerney called it “something
text: like a sleek Vonnegut chassis wrapped
dialog: in layers of post-millennial Zola.”
dialog: David Foster Wallace, welcome to our
dialog: show.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you, glad to be here.
text: He exchanges looks with Lipsky outside the booth.
speaker_heading: NPR GUY
dialog: You have said that you saw yourself as
dialog: - quote - “a combination of being
dialog: incredibly shy, and being an
dialog: egomaniac, too.”
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think I said “exhibitionist, also.”
speaker_heading: NPR GUY
dialog: Meaning?
text: David glances at Lipsky.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I think being shy basically
dialog: means being self-absorbed to the
dialog: extent that it makes it difficult to
dialog: be around other people.
speaker_heading: NPR GUY
dialog: Difficult for you, or difficult for
dialog: the other people?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I suppose a little bit of both.

speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: That was wonderful! I listened to the

speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: So, you have the rest of the day free.
dialog: Where would you like to go?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you know where the Mall of America
dialog: is?
scene_heading: E./I. MALL OF AMERICA/VARIOUS SHOPS - MINNESOTA - 1996 - DAY 79
text: They discover the vast courts at each corner of the mall.
text: They walk through the amusement park; ride a roller coaster;
text: ride a carousel. In a mirror maze, they make their way
text: through, trying not to bump into the walls. They try flight
text: simulators, play mini-golf, and walk through the underwater
text: tunnels of the aquarium. They stare blankly at Build-a-Bear
text: bear parts which stare blankly back at them.
scene_heading: INT. MALL OF AMERICA/FOOD COURT - MINNESOTA - 1996 - DAY 80
text: David and Lipsky sit over lunch, the recorder running on the
text: table between them. They watch SHOPPERS.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wanted to write something that had
dialog: kind of the texture of what life was
dialog: like in America right now: This
text: enormous tsunami of stuff comin’ at
dialog: you. And also - it’s not unfun.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Not at all. It is sort of heavy,
dialog: though. I mean weight-wise.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My friend said when it hit the porch,
text: it sounded like a car bomb going off.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Who are your readers? College kids?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The people who seem most enthusiastic
dialog: are young men. Which I guess I can
dialog: understand - it’s a fairly male book,
text: a fairly nerdy book, about loneliness.
dialog: You can expect that somebody who's
dialog: willing to read and read hard a
dialog: thousand-page book is gonna be
dialog: somebody with some loneliness issues.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You think it’s about loneliness?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think if there is sort of a sadness
dialog: for people under forty-five or
dialog: something, it has to do with pleasure
dialog: and achievement and entertainment.
dialog: And a kind of emptiness at heart of
dialog: what they thought was going on, that
dialog: maybe I can hope that parts of the
dialog: book will speak to their nerve endings
dialog: a little bit.
text: He presses stop on the tape recorder, surprising Lipsky.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: By the way, if you quote any of this,
dialog: you'd do me a favor if you’d say that
dialog: I’m talking about what I hope for the
dialog: book, or what the book is tryin’ to
dialog: do, I don’t pretend that it has. Okay?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: That’s fine.
text: Lipsky presses play.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: So: the Walter Kirn review, in New
dialog: York Magazine -
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Didn’t read it. I mean, I heard.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: “Next year’s book awards have been
dialog: decided” kind of thing? How’d it feel?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I applauded his taste and discernment.
dialog: What do you want me to say? How would
dialog: you feel about it?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: How would I feel? That I’d known all
dialog: along it was good, and here was
dialog: someone validating that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All I know is, this is absolutely the
dialog: best I could do between like 1992 and
dialog: 1995. And if everybody hated it, I
dialog: wouldn’t be thrilled, but I don’t
dialog: think I'd be devastated, either.
dialog: 57.
dialog: It’s like, if you’re used to doing
dialog: heavy-duty literary stuff that doesn’t
dialog: sell well, being human animals with
dialog: egos, we find a way to accommodate
dialog: that fact by the following equation:
dialog: If it sells really well and gets a lot
dialog: of attention, it must be shit. Then,
dialog: of course, the ultimate irony is: if
dialog: your thing gets a lot of attention and
dialog: sells really well, then the very
dialog: mechanism you’ve used to shore
dialog: yourself up when your stuff didn’t
dialog: sell well is now part of the Darkness
dialog: Nexus when it does, so you’re screwed.
dialog: You can’t win.

scene_heading: INT. MULTIPLEX/THEATER - MINNESOTA - 1996 - DAY 82
text: A loud, explosive action scene from Broken Arrow with John
text: Travolta and Christian Slater fills the screen.
text: Seated up close, their heads craned looking up at the screen,
text: Julie and Betsy sit together and Lipsky monitors David's
text: reactions. David is an ideal spectator, totally engaged with
text: a child-like guilelessness that Lipsky finds endearing.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know that guy.

speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: The guy playing Leno?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, the guy playing Letterman.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: How do you know him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Went to Amherst with him.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Friend of yours?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I hated his guts.
text: Laughter. Lipsky gets up to go to the kitchen which is
text: visible from the living room.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Does anyone want drinks or anything?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (calls) There’s also beer.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Soda’s fine, thank you.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (to David) Why did you hate him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He was just very cool and popular and
dialog: I was not, that was the basic offense.
text: Betsy gets something out of her bag and joins Lipsky in the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I brought you something.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You brought me something?
text: She gives him a copy of the Kenyon Review.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Oh, great! This has your poem in it!
dialog: Thank you!
text: In the living room, David shows Julie the TV listings.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look what's on next. Algiers.
dialog: Starring Hedy Lamarr. Have you seen
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Uh, no.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s one of the greats. And Hedy
dialog: Lamarr is fascinating. She invented
text: frequency hopping.
text: David sees Lipsky and Betsy talking and doesn’t like it.
text: Back to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Hey, when I get back to New York, you
dialog: mind if I e-mailed you with questions
dialog: about what Dave was like in grad
dialog: school and stuff?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Sure, if it’s okay with Dave.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I’m sure it’s fine with Dave. Can I
dialog: have your e-mail address?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Sure.
text: She looks for something to write on, scribbles her address
text: and gives it to Lipsky before going back to the living room.
text: A moment later, David gets up, walks over to Lipsky, and
text: backs him up against the fridge.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (whispers )
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Lipsky initially thinks David is joking.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: What?
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I saw you hitting on Betsy.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Hitting on...? I was talking to her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: David, I saw you! You got her to give
dialog: you her address.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Her e-mail address. In case I had
dialog: questions, about the piece I am
dialog: writing about you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I don’t want her talking to you.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Fine! I won’t contact her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I told you she and I dated when we
dialog: were in grad school... The least you
dialog: can do is show me the respect of not
text: coming on to her right in front of me.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Dave, I’m sorry if it looked that way.
dialog: That was not my intention. Besides,
dialog: why would I want to get involved with
dialog: somebody who lives in St. Paul?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're already involved with somebody
dialog: who lives in Los Angeles...
text: David is glaring at him when we hear:
speaker_heading: JULIE (0.S.)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Everything’s fine. Thank you.
dialog: (to Lipsky)
dialog: Just stay away from her. Okay? Bea

text: Once he catches his breath, Lipsky, breaking solidarity with
text: David's abstinence, gets a beer out of the fridge and
text: pointedly, while making eye contact with David, pops open the
text: can and defiantly takes a slug.
scene_heading: INT. JULIE'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - ST PAUL - 1996 - LATER 86
text: Algiers is on television. David watches; Betsy is gone;

speaker_heading: NIGHT
text: The cab pulls up to their hotel. Lipsky is prepared to pay

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I got it.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: That’s all right, my expense
dialog: account’'1l cover it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So will mine. I got it, I said.
text: Lipsky relents.

dialog: (over phone)
dialog: Were you flirting?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: No! Sarah, I swear to you: He just
dialog: completely went bonkers on me.
speaker_heading: SARAH'S VOICE
dialog: You do that, David, you know? You’re
text: not even aware of it.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What do I do?
speaker_heading: SARAH'S VOICE
dialog: You're compulsively flirtatious.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I can’t believe you're taking his
dialog: side!
speaker_heading: SARAH'S VOICE
dialog: I am not!
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yes you are. Listen, I think I’m just
dialog: really tired. I gotta go.
speaker_heading: SARAH'S VOICE
dialog: David? David...?
text: He hangs up.
scene_heading: I/E. HOTEL WHITNEY/VALET AREA - MINNEAPOLIS - 1996 - MORNING 91
text: Lipsky and David, unsmiling, emerge from the hotel with their
text: bags. Patty greets them with a cheery smile.
speaker_heading: PATTY
dialog: Good morning! And how are we this
dialog: morning?
text: David climbs into the backseat.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I think I’1l ride up front.

scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE - 1996 - DAY 92
text: Mid-flight. David, his beaten-up Robert Heinlein paperback
text: on his lap, sleeps soundly with his lips slightly parted and
text: his bandanna’d head leaning against the window. Lipsky
text: studies his sunlit face with new objectivity.
scene_heading: EXT. O'HARE AIRPORT/LONG TERM PARKING - CHICAGO - 1996 - DUSK 93
text: A fresh layer of snow covers every car in the lot, making
text: them indistinguishable from one another. David and Lipsky
text: walk through the rows of cars, David carrying his knapsack.
text: They continue to walk up and down the rows of cars looking
text: for the Grand Am. Lipsky repeatedly clicks his key hoping to
text: have the car announce itself with blinking headlights.
text: Lipsky clicks the key and locates the car. Finally. They
text: throw their bags in the trunk and start to get in.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You didn’t think to write down where
dialog: we parked the car?
text: Lipsky is cold, feeling vulnerable, fighting tears.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: No. I didn’t, okay? Sorry! I fucked
dialog: up. I’m a fuck-up. Not everyone can
dialog: be as brilliant as you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What is with you?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What the fuck is with you?
text: They get into the car.
scene_heading: INT. CAR/OUTSKIRTS - CHICAGO - 1996 - DAY 94
text: They ride in silence. Lipsky, at the wheel, collects his
text: thoughts before speaking his mind. This is a more assertive
dialog: Lipsky than we’ve seen before.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I gotta say... There’s something
dialog: basically false about your approach
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean “false?”
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I think it’s part of your whole social
dialog: strategy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: In what way?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You still feel you’re smarter than
dialog: other people.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, really?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yeah but you act like you’re in the
text: kids’ softball game, but holding back
dialog: your power-hitting, to try to make it
dialog: more competitive for the little ones.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Here, now, for the past three days,
dialog: it’s part of your social strategy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You’re a tough room, you know that?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You make a point of holding back -
dialog: there’s something obvious about you
dialog: holding back your intelligence, to be
dialog: with people who are younger or maybe
dialog: not as agile as you are...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That would make me a real asshole,
dialog: wouldn’t it? I don’t think writers
dialog: are any smarter than other people. I
dialog: think they may be more compelling in
dialog: their stupidity, or in their
dialog: confusion.
dialog: 66.
dialog: But I think one of the true ways that
dialog: I have gotten smarter is, I’ve
dialog: realized that I’m not much smarter
dialog: than other people.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There are ways in which other people
dialog: are a lot smarter than me. Like, I
dialog: don't know, it makes me feel kinda
dialog: lonely...
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There’s certain stuff I’ve told you
dialog: that’s really true and, frankly, I
dialog: think it’s been brave of me.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’ve written enough of these “pieces”
dialog: to know that you could present this in
dialog: a hundred different ways. Ninety of
dialog: which I’m really gonna come off as a
dialog: monumental asshole. But it seems like
dialog: your read of this is, “Huh: what an
dialog: interesting persona Dave is adopting
dialog: for the purposes of this interview.”
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: That’s not what I’m saying.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If we’d done this interview through
dialog: the mail? And I had access to a
dialog: library, and could look stuff up?
dialog: My dream would be for you to write
dialog: this up, send it to me, and I get to
dialog: rewrite all my quotes - which of
dialog: course you'll never do. When I’m in a
dialog: room by myself, alone, and have enough
dialog: time, I can be really really smart.
dialog: Don’t get me wrong: I think I’m
dialog: bright; I think I’m talented. I don’t
text: mean to sound disingenuous.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (amused) Oh, no?!
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I am not an idiot. I mean, you know,
dialog: I can talk intelligently with you
dialog: about stuff. But I can’t quite keep
dialog: up with you.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: That is such bullshit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Believe me: I’m not just “Aw-shucks,
dialog: I’m just in from the country, I’m not
dialog: a real writer, I’m just a regular
dialog: guy.” I’m not trying to lay some kind
dialog: of shit. And I’m -
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You just did it again! You flatter
dialog: me, but are you just being
dialog: patronizing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I just think to look across the room
dialog: and automatically assume that somebody
dialog: else is less aware than me, or that
dialog: somehow their interior life is less
text: rich, and complicated, and acutely
dialog: perceived than mine, makes me not as
dialog: good a writer.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because that means I'm going to be
text: performing for a faceless audience,
dialog: instead of trying to have a
dialog: conversation with a person. If you
dialog: think that's faux, then you think what
dialog: you want. I've got a serious fear of
dialog: being a certain way. And a set I think
dialog: of like, real convictions about why
dialog: I'm continuing to do this, why it's
dialog: worthwhile. Why it's not just an
dialog: exercise in basically getting my dick
dialog: sucked. And, you know what?, this is a
dialog: very clever tactic of yours:
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Tactic, what tactic?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Get me a little pissed off, a little
dialog: less guarded, I’m gonna reveal more.
dialog: 95
dialog: 96
dialog: 68.
dialog: Yes, it's true: I treasure my regular-
dialog: guy-ness; I've started to think it's
dialog: my biggest asset as a writer, that I'm
text: pretty much just like everybody else.
dialog: (A beat.)
dialog: You know what? I’m not doing any kind
dialog: of faux thing with you; I'm not gonna
dialog: say it again.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Okay, but the faux thing - what you
dialog: just said - is an example of the faux
dialog: thing. You don't want to take the
dialog: risk of giving the full you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look, I don’t know if you’re a very
dialog: nice man or not. It’s very clear that
dialog: you don’t believe a word I've said.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: All your protesting... “I’m just a
dialog: regular guy.” You don’t crack open a
dialog: thousand-page book ‘cause you heard
dialog: the author’s a regular guy. You read
dialog: it because the author is brilliant.
dialog: Because you want him to be brilliant.
dialog: So who the fuck are you kidding?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t have the brain cells left to
dialog: play any kind of “faux” games with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Fine.

text: take over driving duty from Lipsky. They drive away.
scene_heading: I/E. CAR/OUTSKIRTS - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - AFTERNOON 96

speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What are you thinking?
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Tour’s over.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Just hit you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. I’m gonna have to feel all this
text: now, instead of just sleepwalk through
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What do you mean by “sleepwalk?”
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've kind of unplugged myself for the
dialog: last three weeks. Meeting a whole lot
dialog: of new people, having to do things,
dialog: you're in a constant low-level state
dialog: of anxiety. And sort of deep,
dialog: existential, you know: fear, that you
dialog: feel kind of all the way down to your
dialog: butthole.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What are you afraid of? I mean,
dialog: what’s the worst thing that could
dialog: possibly happen?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The worst? That I’ll really get to
dialog: like it. That’s the worst.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: The attention?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (nods, then)
dialog: And what would be so wrong about that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Become one of these hideous: “Yet
dialog: another publication party, and Hey,
text: there’s Dave sticking his head in the
dialog: back of the photo.” I’d rather be
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t want to be seen that way.
dialog: Why, would you?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Well, if you're deriving your
dialog: satisfaction from talking about your
dialog: work, as opposed to writing, then,
dialog: yeah, I guess you’d get a lot less
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Exactly. And there’s nothing more
dialog: grotesque than somebody who's going
dialog: around, “I'm a writer, I’m a writer,
dialog: I’m a writer.”
text: Is that a dig at Lipsky? Lipsky thinks so.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t mind appearing in Rolling
dialog: Stone, but I don’t want to appear in
dialog: Rolling Stone as somebody who wants to
dialog: be in Rolling Stone. If you see me
dialog: like, you know, a guest on a game show
dialog: in a couple of years...
text: Lipsky laughs. Pause. David is pensive again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: To have written a book about how
dialog: seductive image is, and how many ways
dialog: there are to get seduced off any kind
dialog: of meaningful path, because of the way
dialog: the culture is now...? What if I
dialog: become this parody of that very thing?
text: Lipsky looks at David, who stares straight ahead, his eyes
text: maybe filling with tears.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Tomorrow, you drive away, get ona
dialog: plane, this is over. And I’m back to
dialog: knowing like twenty people. Then I’m
dialog: going to have to like decompress from
dialog: getting all this attention. Because
dialog: it’s like getting heroin injected into
dialog: your cortex.
text: That registers with Lipsky.
dialog: 97
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONTD)
dialog: And where I’m going to need real balls
dialog: is to be able to sit and go through
dialog: that. And try to remind myself that
dialog: what the reality is: that I’m thirty-
dialog: four years old, and I’m alone ina
text: room with a piece of paper.
text: They drive in silence.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. DAVID'S HOUSE - 1996 - NIGHT 97
text: The Grand Am pulls up, its headlights the only artificial
text: light. The Davids get out and remove their bags. Inside,
text: the dogs are barking in anticipation.
text: David unlocks the door and the dogs greet him and Lipsky
text: exuberantly. David kneels so that the dogs lick his face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (in an Elvis voice)
dialog: I’m never leavin’ you again, I swear.
text: David looks around the carpet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shit Check.
dialog: (discovers some)
dialog: Ah! Look what you did.
text: The dogs sheepishly watch David clean up their shit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Happens to the best of us, eh, boy?
dialog: Never fails. Wait to do your thing
text: after the dog-sitter leaves.
dialog: (to Lipsky)
dialog: Be sure your Rolling Stone readers
dialog: learn about that.
text: David prepares to put on some music. Tape recorder in hand,
text: Lipsky approaches.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Uh. Hey. So, I’m leaving tomorrow
dialog: and, I’ve got to ask you about this
dialog: rumor...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is this the heroin thing? The heroin
dialog: thing again?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It isn’t true. What is so hard for
dialog: you to believe?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: The reason it is so hard to believe is
dialog: because there is so much about drugs
dialog: and addiction in the book...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That doesn’t mean it’s
dialog: autobiographical, the drug stuff in
text: the book is basically a metaphor.
dialog: Look at you. You don’t fucking
dialog: believe a word I’m saying, do you.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I didn’t say that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was not, I never was a heroin
dialog: addict.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Okay. The rumor I heard... was that
dialog: in the late ‘80s, when you were at
dialog: Harvard, you'd gotten involved with
dialog: drugs and had some kind of
dialog: breakdown...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know if I had a breakdown, I
dialog: got really really depressed. I told
dialog: you that. It had nothing to do with
dialog: drugs. I mean, I'm somebody who spent
dialog: most of his life in libraries. I never
dialog: lived that kind of dangerous life. I
dialog: wouldn't even stick a needle into my
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Okay, so how do you think that rumor
dialog: got started?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I have no idea! I have no idea.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Alright... Calm down...
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: To tell you truly, if you structured
dialog: this as some “and then he spiraled
dialog: into some terrible addiction thing,”
dialog: it would be inaccurate. It was more
dialog: like, I got more and more unhappy. The
dialog: more unhappy I would get, the more I
dialog: would drink. There was no joy in the
dialog: drinking. I used it for anesthesia.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Okay. What kind of drinker were you?
dialog: Were you a falling-down drinker? A
dialog: waking-up-in-the-curb drinker?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I was not! Okay? Part of my
dialog: reticence about this whole thing is
dialog: that it won't make very good copy for
dialog: you. Because, no, I was not like that
dialog: at all!
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You did agree to this interview.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know that I did.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Alright, I'm not gonna push much
dialog: further.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm also aware that some addictions
dialog: are sexier than others. My primary
dialog: addiction my entire life has been to
dialog: television. I told you that. Now,
dialog: television addiction is of far less
dialog: interest to your readers than
dialog: something like heroin, that confirms
dialog: the mythos of the writer -
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: A myth I do not believe, okay?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know you don't believe that. I’m
dialog: also aware that one of the things
dialog: swirling around here is you want the
dialog: best fucking article you can have!
dialog: 100
dialog: 101
dialog: 74.
dialog: Why don’t you write whatever the fuck
dialog: you want, but the fact of the matter
dialog: is, it was not a Lost Weekend sort of
dialog: thing. Nor was it some lurid, romantic
dialog: writer-as-alcoholic-sort-of-thing.
dialog: What it was, was a 28-year-old person
dialog: who exhausted a couple other ways to
dialog: live, really taken them to their
dialog: conclusion. Which for me was a pink
text: room, with a drain in the center of
dialog: the floor. Which is where they put me
dialog: for an entire day when they thought I
dialog: was going to kill myself. Where you
dialog: don’t have anything on, and somebody's
dialog: observing you through a slot in the
dialog: wall. And when that happens to you,
dialog: you become tremendously...
dialog: unprecedentedly willing to examine
dialog: some other alternatives for how to
dialog: live.
text: David looks at him for a moment. He walks out of the room,
text: leaving Lipsky behind, his head reeling. Lipsky presses stop
text: on the tape recorder.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/BATHROOM - 1996 - NIGHT 100
text: Lipsky, still digesting the conversation, looks at himself in
text: the mirror while brushing his teeth. He spits into the sink.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/GUEST ROOM - 1996 - NIGHT 10
text: Lipsky is in bed, still awake in the moonlight. The door
text: ajar, David comes in. He speaks softly, in shadow. He can’t
dialog: be seen and can’t see Lipsky very well; it’s sort of like
dialog: confession.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You awake?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was just thinking... It wasn't a
dialog: chemical imbalance, and it wasn't
dialog: drugs and alcohol. It was much more
dialog: that I had lived an incredibly
dialog: American life. That, “If I could just
dialog: achieve X and Y and Z, everything
dialog: would be OK.”
dialog: (A beat.)
dialog: 102
dialog: 103
dialog: 104
dialog: 75.
dialog: There's a thing in the book: when
text: people jump out of a burning
dialog: skyscraper, it's not that they're not
dialog: afraid of falling anymore, it's that
dialog: the alternative is so awful. And then
dialog: you're invited to consider what could
dialog: be so awful, that leaping to your
dialog: death seems like an escape from it. I
dialog: don't know if you've had any
dialog: experience with this kind of thing.
dialog: But it's worse than any kind of
dialog: physical injury. It may be what in
dialog: the old days was known as a spiritual
text: crisis. Feeling as though every axiom
dialog: of your life turned out to be false,
dialog: and there was actually nothing, and
dialog: you were nothing, and it was alla
dialog: delusion. And that you were better
dialog: than everyone else because you saw
dialog: that it was a delusion, and yet you
dialog: were worse because you can't fucking
dialog: function. And it’s really horrible.
dialog: (A beat.)
dialog: I don’t think we ever change. I’m
dialog: sure there are still those same parts
dialog: of me. I’ve just got to find a way
dialog: not to let them drive. Y'know?
dialog: (A beat.)
dialog: Well, anyway... Good night.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Good night.
text: David goes. Lipsky, his eyes moist, scrambles to get his pad
text: and scribbles notes so he won’t forget David at his most
dialog: revealing.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/GUEST ROOM - 1996 - MORNING 102
text: Morning light falls across Lipsky’s face. The dogs greet
text: him. He stirs, gets up.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID’S HOUSE/HALLWAY - 1996 - MORNING 103

speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Morning.

speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Beautiful out here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You should see: in the spring, when
dialog: the wind blows, you can see ripples,
dialog: it’s like water. It’s like the ocean,
dialog: except it’s real green. I mean, it
dialog: really is. Calm, real pretty.
dialog: (Pause.) Hungry?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You know me.
text: They turn back toward the house. David calls the dogs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You should get going.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yeah. Let me take you someplace nice
dialog: this time. Remember, it’s on Jann.
scene_heading: 106 EXT. MCDONALD'S/PARKING LOT - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - DAY 106
text: Lipsy and David emerge. David tucks into the takeout bag.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sorry, I can’t wait, I’m suddenly
dialog: starving, I gotta eat something.
text: David picks pickles off his bacon double cheeseburger.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You don’t like pickles.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, come on. Now the whole world will
dialog: know what my mother’s known for years:
dialog: I'm a picky eater?
text: He takes a bite.
scene_heading: 107 INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - 1996 - DAY 107
text: The dogs are in David and Lipsky’s faces while the men eat.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jeeves, sit! You see, Jeeves gets
text: very obedient when food is around.
dialog: You sit, Drone. It should be clear by
dialog: now that you’re not getting any of
dialog: this.
text: Drone sits. David feeds both dogs morsels of his food.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good dog! There you go, thatta boy.
dialog: (to Lipsky) Don’t leave food within
dialog: their reach - they will eat it.
text: Lipsky takes a note.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You’re not gonna make me look like one
dialog: of those insane old women who talk to
dialog: their dogs, are you?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Don't worry.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I am worried: my dogs’1l be offended.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Your dogs are not gonna read it.
text: Drone playfully nudges Lipsky to the floor.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wow - he’s never taken to a male like
dialog: he’s taken to you.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Except for me, of course.
text: The phone rings. David hands Lipsky his burger.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hold this?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Sure.
text: David goes to get the phone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (on the phone) Hello? Oh, hey.
dialog: 78.
text: He turns away from Lipsky and lowers his voice but Lipsky can
text: still hear him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, I would like to. I can’t right
dialog: now. I’ve got this guy here.
dialog: Lipsky is stung: After all the intimacy they shared, Lipsky
dialog: is just “this guy.”
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The Rolling Stone guy. Yeah. Well, he
dialog: should be leaving pretty soon. Can I
dialog: just meet you there? Okay? Great.
dialog: See you there. Bye.
text: He hangs up. Lipsky tries not to show his hurt.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I should get out of here, let you get
dialog: on with your life.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just this friend. This dance I like
dialog: to go to, with this friend.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You dance?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Uh huh. I’ve just discovered in the
dialog: last few years that I really like it.
dialog: Although I’m still not very good.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What kind of dancing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I tend to do the Jerk, the Swim,
dialog: cheesy 70s disco.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The nice thing about Bloomington?
dialog: You're completely hip if you do that.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Where do you go, a club?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This Baptist church.
dialog: 79.
text: Lipsky can’t tell if David is serious.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why there?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because Baptists can dance.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Wow. Dancing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I will not Vogue.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: Lipsky, listening to David’s voice, smiles ruefully.
speaker_heading: DAVID’S VOICE
dialog: (on tape) That’s the one thing I
dialog: refuse to do: I will not Vogue. It’s
dialog: cool. All these people come, and
dialog: they’ve all got their dancing shoes on
dialog: and stuff. And it’s nice. Everybody
dialog: just, more or less, leaves each other
dialog: alone.

dialog: address data.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Absolutely. (A beat.) Well, I should
dialog: get my stuff together.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And I should start carving an ice
dialog: sculpture out of my car. It’s like
dialog: Antarctica.
text: David grabs his coat and gloves and goes outside. Soon we
text: hear the sound of David scraping ice off his car, which is
dialog: heard throughout the following:

text: Lipsky goes from room to room, as if memorizing this time and
text: place, softly describing what he sees into his recorder.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (into the device) Dog stuff. Throw
text: toys, chew toys. Crap stains on
text: carpet. Shark doll on bookcase.
text: American flag. Alanis. Coal-burning
dialog: fireplace. Brick wall. Fake wood-
dialog: paneling. Soda cans. Lots of ‘em.
dialog: Diet Rite. Looks like a frat; the

scene_heading: INT. DAVID’S HOUSE/HALLWAY/OFFICE - 1996 - DAY 112A
text: Lipsky sees the door to David's office, ajar for the first
text: time. He pushes his way in and discovers a darkened room. He
text: looks around quietly, barely breathing, sees the partially
text: illuminated keyboard and computer. He goes to the closed
text: drapes, pushes them aside and squints as he takes in the
text: brilliant snowy field.
dialog: 112
dialog: 113
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S HOUSE/GUEST ROOM - 1996 - DAY 112
text: The scraping is still heard. Lipsky packs clothes, a loafer,
text: and stops when he sees his book, The Art Fair. He looks at
dialog: his author's photo.
scene_heading: EXT. DAVID'S HOUSE - 1996 - DAY 113
text: His book in hand, Lipsky trudges through the snow and finds
text: David systematically scraping away at his car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Driving that rental of yours? The
dialog: feeling of gliding? This shit box
dialog: dudn’t even have shock absorbers.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ‘85 Nissan Sentra. I know it doesn’t
dialog: look like much, but, man, this thing
text: starts. It’s actually a problem.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I gotta get a new one but I can’t junk
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's my friend.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Ah.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Hey, David, I, uh...
text: Lipsky shyly presents David with a copy of his book.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wow. Just happened to have it on you?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I debated whether or not I should I do
dialog: this.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I don’t know, you don’t think this is
dialog: like some kid-brother sort of thing to
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. Thanks, man, I look forward to
text: reading it.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: You’re welcome. I wrote my address
text: and e-mail on the flyleaf.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’ll read it soon as I’m done with the
dialog: Heinlein and I’1l send you a note.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Great. Thanks.
text: David flips through the book.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’1ll be curious to see what it’s like
dialog: being inside your head for a change.
dialog: I like your cover.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Yeah, me, too. I had them use the
text: cover art for the British edition.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on. You got approval but I - ?
dialog: (stops himself)
dialog: It’s nice. It’s very nice.
text: Lipsky puts his bag in the Grand Am and slams the trunk.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Hey, isn’t it reassuring that a lot of
dialog: people are reading you and saying
dialog: you're a really strong writer?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It'd be very interesting to talk to
dialog: you in a few years.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Why do you say that?
dialog: 115
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ‘Cause my own experience is that
dialog: that’s not so. The more people think
dialog: that you’re really good, actually the
dialog: bigger the fear of being a fraud is.
dialog: The worst thing about having a lot of
dialog: attention paid to you, is that you’re
dialog: afraid of bad attention. If bad
dialog: attention hurts you, then the calibre
dialog: of the weapon that’s pointed at you
dialog: has gone way up. Like from a .22 toa
dialog: -45. But there’s a part of me that
dialog: wants a lot of attention. And that
dialog: thinks I’m really good, and wants
dialog: other people to see it. It’s one of
dialog: the ways I think we’re sort of alike,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: Uh huh.
text: Lipsky smiles and nods. Pause.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: (in farewell) Well...
text: Lipsky’s awkward attempt at a hug - unreciprocated by David -
text: turns into a clumsy handshake. Lipsky gets into the car.
text: David stands at his window.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m not so sure you want to be me.
speaker_heading: LIPSKY
dialog: I don’t?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (A beat. He smiles.)
dialog: Send my best to “Jann.”
text: David shuts the door. Lipsky starts the car and pulls away
text: while David returns to scraping his car.
scene_heading: I/E. CAR/DAVID'S HOUSE - BLOOMINGTON - 1996 - DAY 115

text: box and peels away newspaper to reveal: A SINGLE LOAFER. And
text: a message written on a post-it: “Yours, I presume?”
text: Accompanied by a smiley face. Nothing on the reverse.
text: Nothing else in the box. That’s all. Huh. Lipsky smiles in

speaker_heading: LIPSKY (V.O.)
dialog: We are both so young. He wants
dialog: something better than he has; I want
dialog: precisely what he has already. Neither

speaker_heading: LIPSKY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: David thought books existed to stop
dialog: you from feeling lonely. If I could,
