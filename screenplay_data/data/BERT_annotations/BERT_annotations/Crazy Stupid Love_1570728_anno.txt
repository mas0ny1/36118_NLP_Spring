dialog: (a bit monotone)
dialog: Thank you, Mrs. Thompson.

speaker_heading: (A BEAT)
dialog: I wasn't really sure what I wanted

dialog: talk about that.
dialog: 
text: Cal watches, concerned. Where's his son?

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I grew up a lot this year, I
dialog: think. I used to think that

dialog: Like getting taller and bigger.
dialog: But now I think that growing up
dialog: just makes you smaller. Your

speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: In fairness, I don't know where he
