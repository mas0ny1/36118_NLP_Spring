dialog: I talked to my guy at the State Police

scene_heading: EXT. THE FIELD -- DAWN

scene_heading: EXT. THE FIELD -- DAWN
text: MICHAEL getting out of the car. Standing there.

text: MICHAEL jumping the fence. Walking slowly into the field.
text: Behind him, the MERCEDES with the engine running.
text: THE HORSES aware of him now. Watching him come.
text: MICHAEL’S FACE as he walks. And later on we’1ll understand
text: all the forces roiling inside him, but for the moment, the
dialog: simplest thing to say is that this is a man who needs more
dialog: 16
dialog: than anything to see one pure, natural thing, and by some
text: miracle has found his way to this place. The wet grass and
text: cold air and no coat -- none of it makes any difference to
text: him right now -- he’s a pilgrim stumbling into the cathedral.
text: And he stops. Just standing there. Empty. Open. Lost.
text: Nothing but the field and the fog and the woods beyond.
text: THE HORSES staring at him.
text: MICHAEL staring back. And just like that...
text: THE MERCEDES EXPLODES!
text: THE HORSES already running before MICHAEL can turn back --
text: pieces of the car that have been blown into the sky still

speaker_heading: KAREN

scene_heading: INT. LAW FIRM/ARTHUR _EDEN’S OFFICE -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A SILVER FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH. Young Arthur Edens with his

dialog: of several very traditional items, on a very traditional
text: desk. In fact the whole place is almost disturbingly
text: repressed. The only thing out of place are the dozens of
text: document boxes piled at the center of the room.
text: MARTY and BARRY GRISSOM digging through all of it. Like

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I want all this -- everything here

dialog: to my apartment.
text: MICHAEL in the doorway. Watching them plunder. Until --
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (without looking back)
dialog: Any luck, Michael?
text: BARRY turns, surprised. MICHAEL steps into the office.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: He booked a limo from Newark airport

dialog: and walked away.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You try his place?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: It’s a loft. There’s no doorman.

dialog: You didn’t exactly charm Karen Crowder.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I was punting.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: You’ve got to saddle up here, Michael,
dialog: and get this under control.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Saddle up?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: He needs to be under a doctor’s care
dialog: immediately. He needs to be admitted.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Michael...
dialog: (the voice of reason)
dialog: U/North needs to know that he’s under
dialog: control. That he’s in a facility.
dialog: They’ve been shaken up, they need to
dialog: be reassured.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It’s just not gonna be that easy.
dialog: 53
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Why the hell not?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Because the laws in the State Of New

speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Did you see this fucking tape?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m not arguing with you, Barry, I’m

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: BRINI

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: BRINI
dialog: That is such bullshit...

dialog: wanted.
speaker_heading: BRINI
dialog: I watch these people. At the office.
dialog: How they relate to you. I can always

dialog: that you’ve done something for.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Half of them don’t even know I work

speaker_heading: BRINI

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I have great affection for you,

dialog: kept me in Wisconsin where the arrest

dialog: Was there a note?
scene_heading: DET. DALBERTO

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: MARTY

dialog: You look like hell.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I left right after you did.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: If you say so.

dialog: Jean! Jeannie!
dialog: (calling to his Assistant
dialog: across the way--)
dialog: Where’s the thing? The envelope?
dialog: (back to Michael)
dialog: So I wanted your input, but I couldn’t
dialog: get you and I had to pull the trigger.
dialog: I put Bob Nast and Kim -- which is
dialog: probably a mistake -- they’re gonna try
dialog: to pull together a memorial service by
dialog: the end of the week. I told them to

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Right about what? That we're on
dialog: the wrong side?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wrong side. Wrong way. All of it.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: This is news? We’re defending cancer

dialog: to tell you how we pay the rent?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What would they do, though, if they

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: What would they do? Are you fucking
dialog: soft? They’re doing it!
dialog: (honestly incredulous)
dialog: We don’t straighten this settlement
text: out in the next twenty-four hours,
dialog: they’re gonna withhold nine million
dialog: dollars in fees they owe us. Then
dialog: they’re gonna pull out the video of
dialog: Arthur’s flashdance in Milwaukee and
dialog: sue us for legal malpractice, except
dialog: there won’t be anything to win because
dialog: by that point the merger with London
dialog: will be dead and we'll be selling off

dialog: (handing Michael the
dialog: envelope now--)
dialog: That’s eighty. We’re calling it a
dialog: bonus. You’re getting a three year
dialog: contract at your current numbers.
dialog: That’s assuming this all works out.

dialog: Are they ready?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Almost. They're proofing.
dialog: (to Michael) )
dialog: Look, I agreed to this, okay?
dialog: But there’s rules now. You want
dialog: the contract, you’re signing a
dialog: confidentiality agreement and it’s
dialog: gonna be retroactive and it’s gonna
dialog: be bulletproof. Because Marty’s too
dialog: nice to say it, but with everything
dialog: you know about this place and the
dialog: clients and the people who work here,
dialog: it makes things just a little too
dialog: weird when you come in and ask for
dialog: eighty grand.

text: And she’s done. And it’s gone very, very well. Many happy
text: prosperous faces.
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES
dialog: Thank you, Karen.
dialog: (taking over now)
dialog: If you could just give us a few minutes
dialog: to talk it over...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (with a smile) )
dialog: I‘1l be right outside.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL BALLROOM FOYER -- DAY
text: The big, weird hub of three different huge reception rooms.
text: Wall-to-wall carpet. Chairs stacked in distant corners.
text: Empty. KAREN walking off her excitement. Standing there.
text: Catching her reflection in a wall of mirrors.
dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (0S)
dialog: How’d it go?
text: She turns. Stops. Blinks. Freezes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Pretty freaky, huh?
text: (he’s coming toward her)
dialog: You see Arthur? He’s hanging around
dialog: here somewhere...
text: She’s just paralyzed. He’s carrying one of those copy-shop
dialog: boxes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Hey, I’m kidding...
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: C’mon. Lighten up.
text: He drops the box. Pulls out a RED-COVERED BOOKLET.
dialog: 120
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You have one of these?
dialog: (offering it)
dialog: Great memo. An oldie but a goodie.
dialog: (she doesn’t move)
dialog: Got your heart racing, don’t I?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I don’t know what you think you’re
dialog: doing...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What do you think I’m doing?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: The suit is over. We have a deal.
dialog: This...
dialog: (the memo)
dialog: Whatever this is, it’s meaningless at
dialog: this point.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You think?
dialog: (so enjoying this)
dialog: I must’ve gotten it wrong. I heard
dialog: you had a tentative proposal. I didn’t
dialog: realize you'd written all those checks
dialog: already. What a drag...
dialog: (the box)
dialog: I’ve got thousands of these things,
dialog: what the hell am I gonna do?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I’m calling Marty...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Do it. Call him. That’s a great place
dialog: to start. lLet’s find out who told him
dialog: Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.
dialog: Let’s find out who tapped those phones.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: +.-this...this memorandum...even if it
dialog: were authentic -- which I doubt -- I
dialog: highly doubt...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I know what you did to Arthur.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: ...even if it was, it would belong to
dialog: U/North, it would be protected...
dialog: 121
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I know you killed him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: +..this is a cut-and-dried case of
dialog: attorney-client privilege!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: See that’s just...
dialog: (here comes the steam)
dialog: That’s just not the way to go here,
dialog: Karen. For such a smart person, you’re
dialog: lost, aren’t you? You’ve got the
dialog: moves, but you don’t hear the music.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (backing away)
dialog: ...this conversation...this is over.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m not a guy you kill! I’m the guy
dialog: you buy!
dialog: (that stops her cold)
dialog: Are you so fucking blind you don’t see
dialog: what I am? I’m the easiest part of
dialog: your whole problem and you’re gonna
dialog: kill me? Don’t you know who I am?
dialog: I’m a fixer! I’m a bagman! I do
dialog: everything from shoplifting wives to
dialog: bent congressmen and you’re gonna blow
dialog: me up? What do you need, Karen? Lay
dialog: it on me. You want a carry permit?
dialog: Need a heads-up on an insider trading
dialog: subpoena? Need someone’s name erased
dialog: from an escort service list? Got a
dialog: rich kid busted for dope? Somebody
dialog: beat up their mistress?
dialog: (wide open)
dialog: I sold out Arthur for eighty grand
dialog: and a three-year contract and you’re
dialog: gonna kill me?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (barely)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What do I want? I want more. I want
dialog: out! And now, with this......
dialog: (the memo)
dialog: I want everything.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Is there a number?
dialog: 122
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Ten is the number.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Ten what? Ten million?
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: Where do you think I can get ten
dialog: million dollars?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You know what’s so great about this?
dialog: (the memo)
dialog: Did you read to the end? You see who
dialog: signed it? Let’s go in that ballroom
dialog: and ask Don Jeffries if he wants to
dialog: pass the hat for a worthy cause.
text: KAREN is reeling. She can hardly breathe.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: This...it would have to be a longer
dialog: conversation...and someplace else...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Where? My car?
dialog: (on her hard now)
dialog: Let’s make it easy. Let’s call it five
dialog: to forget about Arthur’s murder.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Five is easier.
dialog: (hopeful for a moment)
dialog: That would be something that we might
dialog: be able to do. Five could work.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Great. And the other five million is
dialog: to forget about the four-hundred-and-
dialog: sixty-eight people who got wiped out by
dialog: your weedkiller.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Let me finish this meeting. Let me
dialog: talk to Don. Let me...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Do I look like I’m negotiating?
text: Across the room -- THE DOOR TO THE BALLROOM OPENS and --
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES
dialog: (all smiles)
dialog: Karen...
dialog: 123
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (over her shoulder)
dialog: One second.
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES
dialog: (stepping out)
dialog: ...everything okay?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (to Michael)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Ten million. Off shore. Bank of my
text: choosing. Immediately.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Say it.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Ten million dollars. Your bank.
text: As soon as this meeting is over.
text: MICHAEL hesitates. She’s serious. It’s his. Ten million.
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES
dialog: (insistent now)
dialog: Karen, everyone's waiting...
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I’m coming!
dialog: (back to Michael--)
dialog: So you...I’1l just...we...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're so fucked.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're fucked. It’s over.
dialog: (his pocket, his phone,
text: flipped open, like it’s
dialog: on--)
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Take a wild guess.
dialog: 124
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES
dialog: (coming toward them)
dialog: Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: I don’t understand...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (the phone)
dialog: Want me to take a picture while I’m
dialog: at it?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: (small and faraway)
dialog: You don’t want the money...?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Keep it. You’re gonna need it.
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES
dialog: Is this fellow bothering you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (to Karen)
dialog: I think I’11 let you tell him.
text: She can’t make sense -- swamped -- lost --
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES
dialog: Karen, I’ve got the whole board sitting
dialog: in there. What the hell is going on?
dialog: (wheeling on Michael)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I’m Shiva the God of Death.
text: MICHAEL starting to walk away and --
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES
dialog: Ron! Ronny!
dialog: (yelling back toward the
dialog: ballroom--)
dialog: I need security out here immediately.
dialog: (turning because--)
text: DALBERTO and TWO OTHER DETECTIVES are coming quickly from one
text: of the distant empty ballrooms and --
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES
dialog: Here we go...
dialog: (thinking they’re part of
dialog: his team--)
dialog: That guy, right there -- stop him --
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 125
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES (cont'd)
dialog: grab that guy!
dialog: (but they don’t)
dialog: What’re you doing?
dialog: (totally confused now
dialog: because--)
text: TWO SECURITY GUARDS are jogging out of the ballroom and --
speaker_heading: DALBERTO
dialog: Slow down, guys...
dialog: (flashing his badge)
text: Police Department. N.Y.P.D.
speaker_heading: DON JEFFRIES
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: KAREN just drifting to the floor and --
text: MICHAEL walking away. Leaving chaos in his wake.
text: There’s DON JEFFRIES still carrying on and DALBERTO trying
dialog: to calm him down.
text: U/NORTH BOARDMEMBERS spilling out of the ballroom to see
dialog: what’s going on.
text: KAREN sitting there on the floor in shock like some sort of
dialog: accident victim.
speaker_heading: FINALLY
text: GENE waiting by the exit. Watching MICHAEL come toward him.
text: Headphones around his neck make it clear he’s been listening
dialog: to the whole thing.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: You okay?
text: They trade a look. MICHAEL has just torn off his skin.
text: Naked to the world.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I need some air.
speaker_heading: GENE
dialog: Sure, just...stay close.
text: MICHAEL nods. Walking away, as we --
scene_heading: EXT. SIXTH AVENUE -- DAY
text: Rush hour. MICHAEL walking -- walking toward the park --
text: walking through the sea of people and faces, as we begin to
text: hear the crazed, manic voice of --
dialog: 126
speaker_heading: ARTHUR EDENS (V.0.)
dialog: Michael. Look at me, Michael. Look at
dialog: me and make believe. Make believe it’s
dialog: not just madness. Because it’s not
dialog: just madness...
scene_heading: TAIL CREDITS begin --
speaker_heading: ARTHUR EDENS (V.0.)
dialog: ...I mean, yes -- okay, yes --
dialog: elements of madness -- the speed of
dialog: madness -- yes, the occasional,
text: euphoric, pseudo-hallucinatory moments
dialog: that, yes -- fine -- agreed --
text: distracting -- nostalgic -- all of
dialog: that -- but that’s just the package
dialog: -- the plate -- think of it as a tax --
dialog: The Mania Tax -- The Insanity Tax --
dialog: or like advertising on TV -- it’s the
dialog: freight -- the weight -- it’s the price
dialog: of the show...
text: As we fade out and...
