dialog: Alright buddy, we're here. Right

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRABBY

speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Exactly where I want to be.

speaker_heading: CRABBY
dialog: Well I got news for you, buddy.
dialog: There's nobody out here but us.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise

speaker_heading: COMBAT SHIP

speaker_heading: CRABBY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: 
text: We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the

text: a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn,
text: the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS
text: toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force
speaker_heading: WHEN ---
dialog: 
text: --- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. He STICKS to the
text: derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP...
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. PLATFORM - OIL DERRICK - MOMENTS LATER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
dialog: Ah, yes. Very carefully...
dialog: 
text: A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed
text: carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOSY PACER
dialog: Oh. A TV camera. What does it
dialog: actually do?
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP

dialog:

text: Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
dialog: This is valuable equipment. Make

speaker_heading: GREM
dialog: This is one of those British spies
dialog: we told you about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACER
dialog: Yeah. This one we caught sticking

dialog: 
text: Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
dialog: Agent Leland Turbo.
dialog: 
text: The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo.
dialog: 
text: Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick
text: flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the
text: Professor. He looks up.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
dialog: It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the
dialog: camera! Kill him!!
dialog: 
text: Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He
speaker_heading: STOPS:
dialog: 
text: BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just
text: came from - BLOWTORCHES ready.
dialog: 
text: Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS,
text: having just found his escape.
dialog: 
text: THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables,
text: swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE
speaker_heading: CRANE ---
dialog: 
text: --- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT
text: where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck!
dialog: 
text: Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners.
text: A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control ---
dialog: 
text: --- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig!
dialog: 
text: The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity...
dialog: 
text: He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces.
dialog: 
text: ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has
text: nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He
text: spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts
text: through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp,
speaker_heading: PAST FINN ---
dialog: 
dialog: --- PAST the pursuing CARS ---
dialog: 
text: --- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back
text: UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!
dialog: 
text: ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No
text: more road. Nowhere else to go.
dialog: 
text: The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him,
text: fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce.
dialog: 
dialog: Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means
dialog: he's got something cooking.
dialog: 
text: Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge
text: of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars.
dialog: 
text: Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly
text: cutting into the water.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREM
speaker_heading: (NONPLUSSED)
dialog: Get to the boats.
dialog: 
text: THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea
text: and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make
text: up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they
dialog: do so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACER
dialog: He's getting away!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMBAT SHIP
dialog: Not for long.
dialog: 
text: The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water.
text: It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and
text: EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the
text: night clouds.
dialog: 
text: UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS.
dialog: We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now
text: CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four
text: DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.
dialog: 
text: ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GREM (OVER RADIO)
dialog: He's dead, Professor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
dialog: Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile
dialog: gone, who can stop us now?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is
dialog: here to help you!
dialog: 
text: He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He

dialog: time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Hey, Otis!
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I
dialog: thought I could make it this time,
dialog: but...
dialog: (he tries to start his
dialog: engine, stalls)
dialog: Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who
dialog: am I kidding? I'll always be a
dialog: lemon.
dialog: 
text: Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Well dadgum, you're leaking oil
dialog: again. Must be your gaskets. Hey,
dialog: look on the bright side: This is
dialog: your tenth tow this month, so that
dialog: means it's on the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: You're the only one that's nice to
dialog: lemons like me, Mater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Don't sweat it. These things happen
dialog: to everybody, Otis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: But you never leak oil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
dialog: tell nobody, but I think my rust is
text: starting to show through.
dialog: 
text: Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN.
dialog: It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: He must be crazy-excited about
dialog: winning his fourth Piston Cup.
dialog: Four! Wow!
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
dialog: But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
dialog: get back `cause we got a whole
dialog: summer's worth of best friend fun
dialog: to make up for. Just me and --
dialog: 
text: Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: --- McQueen!
dialog: 
text: Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
dialog: don't need to go so fast!
dialog: 
text: Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.

scene_heading: INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Wow. I can't believe they renamed
dialog: the Piston Cup after our very own
dialog: Doc Hudson.
dialog: 
text: McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public.
text: McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three
text: Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: I know Doc said these things were
dialog: just old cups, but to have someone
dialog: else win it just didn't feel right,
dialog: you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Well, Doc would've been real proud
dialog: of you. That's for sure.

speaker_heading: MATER

speaker_heading: MATER (O.S.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN

speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.

speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater, you work here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Well yeah I work here. What'd you
dialog: think, I just snuck in here when

dialog: be your waiter, just so I could
dialog: hang out with you?
dialog: 
text: McQueen and Sally exchange a look.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL DORADO (ON TV)
dialog: His story gripped the world! Oil
dialog: billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an
dialog: attempt to become the first car to
dialog: circumnavigate the globe without
text: GPS, ironically ran out of gas and
dialog: found himself trapped in the wild!
dialog: 
text: We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL DORADO (ON TV)
dialog: Feared dead, he emerged 36 days
text: later, running on a fuel he'd
dialog: distilled himself from the natural
dialog: elements! Since then he's sold his
dialog: oil fortune, converted himself from
text: a gas-guzzler into an electric car,
dialog: and has devoted his life to finding
dialog: a renewable, clean-burning fuel!

speaker_heading: MEL DORADO (ON TV)
dialog: And to show the world what his new

dialog: It costs a fortune. Pollution is
dialog: getting worse. I mean, come on.
dialog: It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in
dialog: dead dinosaurs. And we all know
dialog: what happened to them. Alternative
dialog: energy is the future. Trust me,
text: Mel, after seeing Allinol in action
dialog: at the World Grand Prix, nobody
dialog: will ever go back to gasoline
dialog: again.

dialog: you.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL DORADO (ON TV)
dialog: Miles, why not invite Lightning
dialog: McQueen?
dialog: 
text: Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
dialog: Of course we invited him. But
text: apparently after a very long racing
dialog: season he is taking some time off
dialog: to rest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO (ON TV)
dialog: Lightning McQueen would not have a
dialog: chance against Francesco!
dialog: 
dialog: Mater doesn't like this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO (ON TV)
dialog: I can go over 300 kilometers an
dialog: hour! In miles that is like, uh...
text: way faster than McQueen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL DORADO (ON TV)
dialog: Let's go to the phones. Baltimore,
dialog: Maryland, you're on the air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (ON TV)
dialog: Am I on? Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL DORADO (ON TV)
dialog: You're on. Go ahead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CALLER (ON TV)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL DORADO (ON TV)
dialog: Go ahead, caller.
dialog: 
dialog: Dial tone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEL DORADO (ON TV)
dialog: Let's go to Radiator Springs.
dialog: You're on, caller.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
dialog: Yeah, that Italian feller you got
dialog: on there can't talk that way about
dialog: Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest
dialog: race car in the whole wide world.
dialog: 
text: Fillmore and Sarge look around. Mater is visible in the back
text: of the bar on an office phone.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARGE
dialog: Uh-oh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO (ON TV)
dialog: If he is, how you say "the bestest
dialog: race car," then why must he rest,
dialog: eh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
dialog: Cause he knows what's important.
dialog: Every now and then he prefers just
dialog: to slow down, enjoy life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO (ON TV)
dialog: Ah, you heard it! Lightning McQueen
dialog: prefers to be slow! Of course, this
dialog: is not news to Francesco. When I
dialog: want to go to sleep I watch one of
dialog: his races. After two laps I am out
dialog: cold.
dialog: 
text: Audible RXNS from the bar. A crowd has been forming ever
dialog: since Mater started talking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
dialog: That ain't what I meant.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: MCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Hey, what's going on over there?
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
dialog: 
text: THE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that
text: they're watching Francesco on the television.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
speaker_heading: (TO SALLY)
dialog: Oh, it's that Italian Formula car.
dialog: His name is ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder
text: there's a crowd.
dialog: 
text: When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if
dialog: Italian were her mother's tongue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Wait, why do you know his name? And
dialog: don't say it like that. It's three
dialog: syllables, not ten.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: What? He's nice to look at. You
dialog: know, open-wheeled and all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: What's wrong with fenders? I
dialog: thought you like my fenders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
dialog: Well let me tell you something else
dialog: there, Mr. San Francisco ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
dialog: McQueen could drive circles around
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO (ON TV)
dialog: Driving in circles is all he can
dialog: do, no?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
dialog: No! I mean yes. I mean he could
dialog: beat you anywhere, anytime, any
dialog: track.
dialog: 
text: On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to ---
dialog: 
text: --- Mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO (ON TV)
dialog: Mel, can we move on? Francesco
dialog: needs a caller who can provide a
dialog: little more intellectual
text: stimulation. Like a dump truck.
dialog: 
text: ON MCQUEEN. He doesn't like this at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Ha ha! That shows what you know.
dialog: Dump trucks is dumb.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Mater is YANKED from the booth and replaced by
text: McQueen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Yeah, hi, this is Lightning
dialog: McQueen. Look, I don't appreciate
dialog: my best friend being insulted like
dialog: that.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO (ON TV)
dialog: McQueen! That was your best friend?
dialog: This is the difference between you
dialog: and Francesco. Francesco knows how
dialog: good he is. He does not need to
text: surround himself with tow trucks to
dialog: prove it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Those are strong words from a car
dialog: that is so fragile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO (ON TV)
dialog: Fragilé!? He calls Francesco
dialog: fragilé? Not so fast, McQueen!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: "Not so fast." What is that, your
dialog: new motto?
dialog: 
text: Francesco goes ballistic in Italian. They cut his mic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
dialog: Well, this sounds like something
dialog: that needs to be settled on the
dialog: race course. What do you say,
dialog: Lightning McQueen? We've still got
dialog: room for one more racer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Well, I would love to. The only
dialog: thing is my crew's off for the
dialog: season so ---
dialog: 
text: A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi
text: flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. Ramone backs
text: away, having spray painted "TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN" on it.
text: Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUIDO
dialog: Pit stop.
dialog: 
text: McQueen turns back to the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: You know what? They just got back.
dialog: Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!
dialog: 
text: The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS.
dialog: 
text: MOMENTS LATER - General excitement as McQueen exits the phone
text: booth where Sally waits. Off her look:
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: I know, I know. I just got back.
dialog: But we won't be long and ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've
dialog: got enough to do here. Mater's
dialog: going to have a blast though.
dialog: (off McQueen's silence)
dialog: You're bringing Mater, right? You
dialog: never bring him to any of your
dialog: races.
dialog: 
text: McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their
text: drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Just let him sit in the pits, give
dialog: him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a
dialog: thrill of a lifetime for him.
dialog: 
text: Mater arrives.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Your drinks, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: I didn't taste it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: How'd you like to come and see the
dialog: world with me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: You mean it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: You got me into this thing. You're
dialog: coming along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEGIN MONTAGE:
dialog: 
text: - McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone.
text: Mater, now sporting a "Team McQueen" emblem, seems psyched as
dialog: well.
dialog: 
text: - An airport DEPARTURES SIGN advertises the next flight:
dialog: Tokyo, Japan.
dialog: 
text: - Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen, Guido,
dialog: Luigi, Fillmore and Sarge as ---
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: --- the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane.
text: Red bawls.
dialog: 
text: - IN THE JET, LATER. McQueen and Mater are the only ones
text: awake, watch an insane Japanese game show.
dialog: 
text: - JAPAN AT NIGHT. A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour,
text: scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech
text: skyscrapers.
dialog: 
text: - INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and
text: McQueen enter. A tourist sees McQueen and faints.
dialog: 
text: - A KABUKI THEATER. Team McQueen watches a methodical dance.
text: Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives. He looks insane.
dialog: 
text: - A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a
text: parking space. Mater, now in his element, cheers.
dialog: 
text: The MONTAGE ENDS on this high note as we CUT TO ---
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MUSEUM - TOKYO - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: ---- TEAM MCQUEEN, as they roll up the red carpet. Press is
text: held at bay behind ropes. WORLD GRAND PRIX and ALLINOL logos
dialog: are strategically placed for maximum press exposure. RACERS
text: are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TOKYO MUSEUM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which
text: overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As
text: they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUIGI
dialog: Guido, look! Ferraris and tires!
dialog: Let's go!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
speaker_heading: (IMPRESSED)
dialog: Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater,
dialog: remember: best behavior.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: You got it, buddy. Hey, what's
dialog: that?
dialog: 
text: He sees something, peels away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEWIS HAMILTON
dialog: Hey, McQueen, over here!
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen
text: now has no choice but to let Mater go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Hey, Jeff. Lewis!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a
text: pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with
dialog: his hook.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Hey! You done good! You got all the
dialog: leaves!
dialog: 
text: People turn at the noise he's making.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF GORVETTE
dialog: Check out that tow truck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEWIS HAMILTON
dialog: I wonder who that guy's with?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Will you guys excuse me just for
dialog: one little second?
dialog: 
text: He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator
dialog: Springs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: You're just realizing that? Boy,
dialog: that jet-lag really done a number
dialog: on you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater, look -- things are different
dialog: over here. Which means maybe you
dialog: should, you know, act a little
dialog: different too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Different than what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Well, just... help me out here,
dialog: buddy. I ---
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: You need help? Shoot, why didn't
dialog: you just say so? That's what a tow
dialog: truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
dialog: Mr. San Francisco!
dialog: 
text: FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: I'll introduce you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater, no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: (already on his way)
dialog: Look at me -- I'm helping you
dialog: already!
dialog: 
text: On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
dialog: to meet ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Nice to meet you, Francesco.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
dialog: very good-looking. Not as good as I
dialog: thought, but you're good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
speaker_heading: (TO FRANCESCO)
dialog: Excuse me. Can I get a picture with
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Anything for McQueen's friend.
dialog: 
text: As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
dialog: sees this. She's Lightning
text: McQueen's girlfriend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Oooh.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: She's a big fan of yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Hey, she has good taste.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
dialog: wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: You're right. She's a huge fan. She
dialog: goes on and on about your open
dialog: wheels here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
text: as going "on and on."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Francesco is familiar with this
dialog: reaction to Francesco. Women
dialog: respect a car that has nothing to
dialog: hide.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Yeah, uh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Let us have a toast.
dialog: 
text: McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Let's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: (raising a drink)
dialog: I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
dialog: Miss Sally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
dialog: win tomorrow to her. So if we both
dialog: do it, it's really not so special.
dialog: Besides, I don't have a drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: I'll go get you one. You mind if I
dialog: borrow a few bucks for one of them
dialog: drinks?
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: (could kill him)
dialog: They're free, Mater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
dialog: here?
dialog: 
text: Mater ZIPS OFF.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: I should probably go keep an eye on
dialog: him. See you at the race.
dialog: 
text: McQueen starts to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Yes, you will see Francesco. But
dialog: not like this.
dialog: 
text: Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: You will see him like this, as he
dialog: drives away from you.
dialog: 
text: Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: That's cute. So you had one of
dialog: those made up for all the racers?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: He rolls off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: He is so getting beat tomorrow.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Ladies and gentlecars... Sir Miles
dialog: Axlerod!
dialog: 
text: MILES AXLEROD drives through an infinity fountain, appears.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: It is my absolute honor to
dialog: introduce to you the competitors in
dialog: the first-ever World Grand Prix.
dialog: From Brazil. Number eight...
dialog: 
text: ON FINN MCMISSILE. He appears from the shadows, keeps a
text: careful distance from the stage. He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON ---
dialog: 
text: --- THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll, catching
text: Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity.
dialog: 
text: Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the
text: photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT
text: A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL
text: SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
text: A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
text: radiator.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: That's because it's air-cooled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley
dialog: Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I
dialog: have a message from London.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Not here.
speaker_heading: (LOUDLY)
dialog: You must try the canapes on the
dialog: mezzanine!
dialog: 
text: He moves her onto an elevator. The doors close on them.
dialog: 
text: IN THE ELEVATOR, GOING UP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: So the lab boys analyzed the photo
dialog: I sent? What did they learn about
dialog: the camera?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: It appears to be a standard
dialog: television camera. They said if you
dialog: could get closer photos next time,
dialog: that would be great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: This was London's message?
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil
dialog: platforms you were on? Turns out
dialog: they're sitting on the biggest oil
dialog: reserve in the world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: How did we miss that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: They'd been scrambling everyone's
dialog: satellites. The Americans actually
dialog: discovered it just before you did.
dialog: They placed an agent on that
text: platform, under deep cover. He was
text: able to get a photo of the car
dialog: who's running the entire operation.
dialog: 
text: The doors OPEN and they exit onto the Mezzanine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Who is it? Has anyone seen the
dialog: photo yet?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: No, not yet. The American is here
dialog: tonight to pass it to you. He'll
dialog: signal you when he's ready.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: GOOD ---
dialog: 
text: Finn suddenly STOPS COLD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Oh no.
dialog: 
text: Professor Zundapp is visible below them. He talks with a few
text: Pacers and Gremlins. Finn quickly retreats into the shadows.
text: Holley follows suit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Change of plan. You're meeting the
dialog: American.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: What, me?
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Those thugs down there were on the
dialog: oil platform. If they see me, the
dialog: whole mission is compromised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm
dialog: in Diagnostics. I'm not a field
dialog: agent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: You are now.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: MATER as he grabs a drink, keeps moving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: I'll take one of them.
dialog: 
text: He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large
text: assortment of drinks balanced.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Never know which one McQueen'll
dialog: have a hankering for.
dialog: 
text: He approaches a sushi bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Hey, what you got here that's free?
dialog: How about that pistachio ice cream?
dialog: 
dialog: He refers to wasabi, of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSHI CHEF
dialog: No, no. Wasabi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up
dialog: with you? That looks delicious.
dialog: 
text: The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Uh, a little more, please.
dialog: It is free, right?
dialog: (the chef adds more)
dialog: Keep it coming. A little more. Come
dialog: on, let's go, it's free! You're
dialog: getting there... Scoop scoop!
dialog: 
text: The chef gives in. Scoops a baseball-sized ball out.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of
dialog: ice cream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSHI CHEF
dialog: (in Japanese, subtitles)
dialog: My condolences.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
dialog: 
text: MILES AXLEROD - He's now nearly done with his intros.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: ... and now, our last competitor ---
dialog: Number 95, Lightning McQueen!
dialog: 
text: MCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Thank you so much for having us,
dialog: Sir Axlerod. I really look forward
dialog: to racing. This is a great
dialog: opportunity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: Oh, the pleasure is all ours,
dialog: Lightning. You and your team bring
dialog: excellence and professionalism to
dialog: this competition.
dialog: 
text: As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain.
text: Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage,
text: making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Somebody get me water!
dialog: 
text: He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
speaker_heading: (LAPPING WATER)
dialog: Sweet relief...
dialog: 
text: Miles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it.
text: Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: (to the crowd)
dialog: Whatever you do, do not eat the
text: free pistachio ice cream. It has
dialog: turned!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is
dialog: Mater.
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: I know him. This is the bloke that
text: called into the television show.
speaker_heading: (TO MATER)
dialog: You're the one I have to thank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: No, thank you. This trip's been
dialog: amazing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
speaker_heading: (TO MCQUEEN)
dialog: He's a little excited, isn't he?
dialog: 
text: TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: But wait, I... oh, shoot.
dialog: 
text: McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles
text: Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater, you have to get a hold of
dialog: yourself. You're making a scene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: But I never leak oil. Never.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Go take care of yourself right now.
dialog: 
text: Mater drives off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON MATER - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: He drives through the party, frantic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Coming through! Excuse me, leakin'
dialog: oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank
dialog: you. I gotta go!
dialog: 
text: Someone points Mater down a hallway. He whips around the
speaker_heading: CORNER ---
dialog: 
text: --- and STOPS. Finds himself in front of TWO BATHROOM DOORS,
text: neither of which clearly indicate MALE or FEMALE.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: What the...
dialog: 
text: Mater chooses one, drives inside. A SHRIEK is heard and Mater
text: zips out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Sorry ladies!
dialog: 
text: He heads into the other door ---
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mater rolls in, still `holding it in' like a kid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: I never leak I never leak I never
dialog: leak...
dialog: 
text: He sees someone leaving a stall. He heads in.
dialog: 
text: IN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Wowee...
dialog: 
text: The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights.
text: High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as
dialog: if he's going to get an oil change.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: What in the---
dialog: 
text: A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR,
text: followed by images of waterfalls and rivers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER

dialog: 
text: OUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a

dialog: 
text: IN THE STALL - Mater, still TRAPPED, is now being SCRUBBED as

dialog: 
text: ON THE TRACK - McQueen boxes out Francesco, holds his slim
text: lead, but barely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
text: Guys, a little too much chatter.
dialog: Let's keep this line clear.
dialog: 
text: BOOM! A racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke,
text: skids out of control.
dialog: 
text: ON GREM - laughing. That was clearly his handiwork.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - SAME
dialog: 
scene_heading: HOLLEY (ON MATER'S RADIO)
dialog: There's no time for messing about.
dialog: You've got to get out of the pits.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Is there gonna be cable where you
dialog: is so I can watch the rest of the
dialog: race?
dialog: 
text: ON HOLLEY - Watching from the downtown building.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY (INTO RADIO)
dialog: You're running out of time!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN (OVER RADIO)
dialog: They're coming, Shiftwell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY (INTO RADIO)

speaker_heading: (TO FINN)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Well, all right but I usually like
dialog: to have a proper detailing done
dialog: before I meet a lady friend.
dialog: 
text: He moves toward the back PIT DOOR, is about to open it.
dialog: 
text: OUTSIDE THE PITS - ACER and another Pacer approach McQueen's

dialog: 
text: --- Finn, holding a fire extinguisher.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACER
dialog: Finn McMissile? But you're dead!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Then this shouldn't hurt at all.
dialog: 
text: He empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past. They
text: try and follow, but have been blinded. One of them crashes
text: right into a COP.
dialog: 
text: ON FINN - Already on the move, along a side street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Miss Shiftwell?
dialog: 
text: ON HOLLEY - Tracking everything on a grid map. Mater looks
text: like Pac Man, weaving through the streets as bad guys close
text: in all around him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: I've got him in the back alleys
text: east of the garages. Multiple
text: assailants are closing in quickly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN (OVER RADIO)
dialog: Keep him moving. I'm on my way.
dialog: 
text: ON MATER - He turns a corner, sees a flower shop.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Hey, new lady friend? You like
dialog: flowers?
dialog: 
text: ON THE TRACK - McQueen, hearing this, is taken aback.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: ON MATER - Slowing at the flower shop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
dialog: No! Don't go 'in' anywhere. Just

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Stay outside. Gotcha.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON THE TRACK
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN

speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Grazie and arrivaderci!

speaker_heading: DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
dialog: I cannot believe what I just saw,
dialog: Brent. That was a bonehead move.
dialog: You don't open up the inside like
dialog: that!
dialog: 
text: IN THE BACK ALLEYS - As Mater moves on he's followed by
text: Pacers and Gremlins. Suddenly ---
dialog: 
text: --- CABLES whip in front of them, pulling over flower vending
text: machines and sending the shop's owners into a frenzy. They
text: direct their attention to the AMCs, who try and explain.
dialog: 
text: ON FINN, admiring his handiwork as he appears. Just as he
text: turns to leave he's BROADSIDED and pushed INTO A DARK ALLEY.
dialog: 
text: IN THE ALLEY - Finn finds himself boxed by two Pacers and
dialog: pushed toward ---
dialog: 
text: --- ACER, who now holds a FLAME THROWER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACER
dialog: This time I'm gonna make sure you
dialog: stay dead.
dialog: 
text: He hits the flame. WHOOOSSSH!!
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ON ANOTHER STREET - Mater clicks along, still looking for
text: Holley. Just as he passes the alley entrance where Finn
dialog: stares down death:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
dialog: You're doing brilliantly. Now just
dialog: stay focused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: What's that? You want me to head
dialog: toward that ruckus?
dialog: 
text: Mater turns INTO the alley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
dialog: No! Don't go down that street!
dialog: 
text: IN THE ALLEY - Finn, now nearly pushed completely into the
text: flame thrower, leaps into the air. He FIGHTS BACK, using his
text: wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were
text: human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies.
dialog: 
text: Mater witnesses the whole thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Wow! A live karate demonstration!
dialog: 
text: ON THE TRACK - McQueen, now playing catch-up again, scowls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.
dialog: 
text: IN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a
text: bullet into a gas main line, causing an EXPLOSION that tosses
text: Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP'S SIGN.
dialog: 
text: ON THE TRACK - The end of the race is nigh ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
dialog: Francesco's the winner, McQueen's
dialog: number two!
dialog: 
text: IN THE ALLEY - Finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: That was cool! Hey, can I get your
dialog: autograph?
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door,
text: momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have
text: past, Finn has disappeared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Hey, where'd he go?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
dialog: Our rendezvous has been
dialog: jeopardized. Keep the device safe.

speaker_heading: MATER

scene_heading: EXT. PRESS STAGE - LATER

speaker_heading: DARRELL CARTRIP
dialog: Francesco, over here! Hey, what was
dialog: your strategy today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Strategia? Francesco needs no
dialog: strategy, it's very simple. You
dialog: start the race, wait for Lightning
text: McQueen to choke, pass him, then
dialog: win. Francesco always wins. It's
dialog: boring.
dialog: 
text: McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly
dialog: notices something O.S.
dialog: 
text: McQueen's P.O.V. - It's MATER, appearing from a side street,
text: moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARRELL CARTRIP
speaker_heading: (TO FRANCESCO)
dialog: I gotta tell you, dude. You were in
dialog: trouble for awhile. That dirt track

speaker_heading: FRANCESCO

speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the
dialog: race over? You won, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater, why were you yelling things
dialog: at me while I was racing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's
dialog: funny right there. Nah, see that's
dialog: `cause I seen these two fellers
dialog: doing some sort of karate street
dialog: performance. It was nutso. One of
dialog: them even had a flamethrower ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: A flamethrower? What are you
dialog: talking about? I don't understand.
dialog: Where were you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Going to meet my date.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Your date?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: She started talking to me as a

dialog: to go ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you
dialog: up, did I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: I lost the race because of you!

dialog: Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---

speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to
dialog: somebody and explained what
dialog: happened I could help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: I don't need your help. I don't
dialog: want your help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESS (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, there he is!!
dialog: 
text: The press finds McQueen, swarms him. Mater is pushed
text: backwards as the questions fly again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESS
dialog: - McQueen, you had it in the bag!
dialog: - Yeah, what happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: I made a mistake. But I can assure
dialog: you, it won't happen again.
dialog: 
text: On Mater. He takes this badly.

dialog: 
text: FOOTAGE OF MILES AXLEROD, speaking to an aggressive press. He

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Who are you with? FBI, CIA?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Let's just say I'm triple-A
dialog: affiliated. You know, I know some
dialog: karate. I don't wanna brag or
dialog: nothing, but I've got me a black
text: fan belt.
dialog: 
text: BEEP! Finn's rearview alarms. His camera has picked up Grem

dialog: the corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Hey, you wanna see some moves I
dialog: made up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: You're being followed.
dialog: 
text: Finn quickly turns, fires a tiny GLASS CUTTING BEETLE at the
text: window. As Mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a
dialog: round hole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: This first one I can reach into a
text: car's hood, pull out his battery,
dialog: and show it to him before he
dialog: stalls. I call it, "What I

speaker_heading: FINN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: This is First Class service. You

dialog: 
text: ACER and GREM appear, chasing them. Mater, who is facing

speaker_heading: MATER
speaker_heading: (TO FINN)
dialog: Your karate partners are back here.

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Finn, without hesitation, fires a MINI ROLLING-JACK. The jack
text: DRIVES ITSELF toward Grem, anchors itself under his frame and
text: flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket
dialog: OFF ---
dialog: 
text: THE ROCKET - it flies toward Mater and Finn.

speaker_heading: MATER
speaker_heading: (TO FINN)
dialog: You remember that whole thing about
dialog: me not stopping no matter what?
dialog: 
text: Just as it looks dire --- RATATATATATATAT!!! SIDDELEY

speaker_heading: FINN
speaker_heading: (TO SIDDELEY)

dialog: 
text: Just as Mater's wheels touch the ramp, BULLETS PING around
text: him in a spray. Siddeley is HIT, a tire BLOWN. He yells in
dialog: pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Hold on, Sid!
dialog: 
text: Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass.
dialog: 
text: A gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S

dialog: 
text: Acer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET ---
dialog: 
text: --- OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker.
dialog: 
text: ON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac,
text: where the grass and runway meet WATER. He HITS THE GAS, his
dialog: only hope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDDELEY
dialog: Finn, it's now or never!
dialog:

speaker_heading: SIDDELEY
dialog: Hold on!

speaker_heading: FINN

speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: (to Mater, expectantly)
dialog: What is this?
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Well, that's one of the worst
dialog: engines ever made. It's an old

dialog: appear?
dialog:

speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: You might not be happy, but I bet

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMBER
dialog: They should. I sold them.

speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: To whom?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMBER
dialog: No idea. He's my best customer, but

speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't
dialog: nothing truer than that.

speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: "Lemon?"

speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Yeah, you know. Cars that don't

speaker_heading: MATER

dialog: I figured it out when I realized
dialog: you all attached this ticking time
text: bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same
dialog: bolts that hold together that old
text: British engine from the photograph.
dialog: Holley! Show that picture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: O-kay...
dialog: 
text: Holley projects the much discussed PHOTO OF THE ENGINE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: And then I remembered what they say
dialog: about old British engines - "If
dialog: there ain't no oil under `em, there
dialog: ain't no oil in `em."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: What is he talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: It was you leaking oil at the party
dialog: in Japan. You just blamed it on me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: Electric cars don't use oil, you
dialog: twit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Then you're faking it. You didn't
dialog: convert to no electric. We pop that
dialog: hood we gonna see that engine from
dialog: that picture right there.
dialog: 
text: Mater moves toward Miles Axlerod to pop his hood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: This lorry's crazy. He's going to
dialog: kill us all!
dialog: 
text: Miles Axlerod BACKS UP to the edge of the stage.
dialog: 125.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: Stay away!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: But Sir Axlerod created the race,
dialog: Mater. Why would he want to hurt
dialog: anyone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: To make Allinol look bad so
dialog: everybody'd go back to using oil. I
dialog: mean, he said it himself with that
text: disguised voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: "Dee-sguised voice?" What are you
dialog: talking about? You're nuts, you
dialog: are!
dialog: 
text: The QUEEN'S GUARDS have had ENOUGH. As has the PRINCE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCE WHEELIAM
dialog: This is going nowhere fast. We
dialog: really should go, Grandmother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: One moment. I'd like to see where
dialog: this is going.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Mater, he created Allinol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Yeah, but what if he found that
text: huge oil field just as the world
dialog: was trying to find something else?
dialog: 
text: Mater sticks his ticking bomb-nose into Miles Axlerod's
dialog: grill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: What if he came up with Allinol
dialog: just to make alternative fuel look
dialog: bad?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: "What if?" You're basing this on a
dialog: "What if"?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Okay, that's it.
dialog: 
text: And the QUEEN'S GUARDS spirit the Queen and Prince Wheeliam
dialog: out of there FAST ---
dialog: 126.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's
dialog: crazy!
dialog: 
text: Now it's just Miles Axlerod, Mater, McQueen, Finn and Holley.
text: Miles Axlerod's back tires slip on the edge of the podium as
text: he is cornered by Mater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: Keep away, you idiot!
dialog: 
dialog: 00:00:08...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Mater!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: Mater!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: Someone do something!
dialog: 
text: Everyone FLINCHES, DUCKS or DIVES FOR COVER except McQueen,
dialog: Mater and Axlerod ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: You're insane, you are!
dialog: Deactivate!!
dialog: 
text: The bomb FREEZES at 00:01.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day,
dialog: Sir Axlerod.
dialog: 
text: General shock all around. Miles Axlerod realizes what he's
text: done, looks terrified. Police surround him.
dialog: 
text: Mater FLINGS Miles Axlerod's hood open with his hook,
text: revealing AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, oil dripping from
text: all sides. It MATCHES the photo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
text: The engine from the photo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: It's a perfect match!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILES AXLEROD
dialog: How did the tow truck figure it
dialog: out?
dialog: 127.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
speaker_heading: (TO MATER)
dialog: It's official. You're coming to all

speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Mater, let's go. You're on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. QUEEN'S CHAMBER - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LORD STEWARD
dialog: Your Majesty. May I present for the
dialog: investiture of honorary Knighthood
dialog: of the British Realm. Tow Mater of
dialog: Radiator Springs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Go get `em, buddy.
dialog: 
text: McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls
text: forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater."
dialog: 
text: Applause from all around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
speaker_heading: (LOOKS UP)
dialog: "Sir?" Shoot, you can just call me
dialog: Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna
dialog: hear none of this "Sir" business.
dialog: By the way, have y'all met each
dialog: other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen,
text: Queen. McQueen? McMissile.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 128.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: So there I was: rocket jets going
text: full blast, McQueen hanging on for
dialog: dear life when suddenly them two
text: nasty lemons come out of nowhere,
dialog: guns drawed. We was goners. But
dialog: then out of nowhere, this beautiful
text: spy car swoops in from the sky to
dialog: save us!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINNY
dialog: That's a very entertaining story,
text: young man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAN
dialog: Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of
dialog: this happened. Rocket jets? Flying
dialog: spy cars?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: No, you're quite right. It does
dialog: sound a bit far-fetched.
dialog: 
text: The crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is
text: right below her, driving up the street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Holley! Finn!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see
dialog: you again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: What're you doing here?
dialog: 129.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: Our satellites picked up an urgent
dialog: communique.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUIGI
dialog: So you got my e-mail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
dialog: Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a
dialog: great time. Everybody! This here's
dialog: Finn McMissile. He's a secret
dialog: agent.
speaker_heading: (WHISPERS)
dialog: Don't tell nobody. And this is
dialog: Holley Shiftwell. She's ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so
dialog: nice to meet you all.
dialog: 
text: Everyone is shocked. Including Mater. Guido's jaw drops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUIGI
speaker_heading: (TO MATER)
dialog: Guido believe you now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLO
speaker_heading: (TO HOLLEY)
dialog: Whoa, honey. You got a nasty dent
dialog: there.
dialog: 
text: Indeed, Holley still wears the dent from when she saved Mater
dialog: from Grem and Acer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAN
dialog: (already crushing on her)
dialog: Was that from when you swooped in
dialog: and saved them in London?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINNY
dialog: Van!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAN
dialog: What? I'm just asking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLO
speaker_heading: (TO HOLLEY)
dialog: Don't you worry, sweet pea. My baby
dialog: Ramone can get that fixed up for
dialog: you in no time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAMONE
dialog: Yeah, sure thing. No problemo. Just
dialog: let me go get my tools.
dialog: 130.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent.
dialog: It's way too valuable.
dialog: 
text: Mater takes this in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIZZIE
dialog: A "valuable" dent? Oh, she's as
dialog: crazy as Mater.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MACK
dialog: Those two are perfect for each
dialog: other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: You know, there's one thing I still
dialog: don't get. The bad guys hit me with
dialog: the beam from the camera, right? So
dialog: why didn't I, you know...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MATER
text: Explode in a fiery inferno?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FINN
dialog: We couldn't figure that one out
dialog: either.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLEY
dialog: Our investigation proved that
dialog: Allinol was actually gasoline. And
dialog: Miles Axlerod engineered it so that
dialog: when it got hit by the beam it
dialog: would explode.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Wait a second. Fillmore, you said
dialog: my fuel was safe.
dialog: 
text: McQueen turns to Fillmore. Everyone does.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FILLMORE
dialog: If you're implying that I switched
dialog: out that rotgut excuse for
dialog: alternative fuel with my all-
dialog: natural, sustainable, organic
dialog: biofuel just because I never
dialog: trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong,
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: (RE: SARGE)
dialog: It was him.
dialog: 131.

speaker_heading: SARGE

dialog: Yeah, we should do this every year.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: I just figured, we never found out

dialog: Plus: no press, no trophy. Just
dialog: racing - the way I like it.

speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Francesco likes it like this too.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: What is that?
dialog: 
text: McQueen has a new bumper sticker: "Ka-ciao, Francesco."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: It's just something I had made up
dialog: for the occasion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANCESCO
dialog: Is good, McQueen. Very funny. It
dialog: was funnier when I did it, but
dialog: it's very funny. What are you going
dialog: to do next? Are you going to take
dialog: off your fenders? Try it. You'll
dialog: like it.
dialog: 
text: Francesco leaves. We stay with McQueen and Sally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: So he's not so good-looking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: Yeah. Nice try.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I'm serious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCQUEEN
dialog: That's why I love you, Sally.

speaker_heading: SALLY
