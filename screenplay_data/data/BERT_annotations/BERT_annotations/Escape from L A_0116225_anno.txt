dialog: 
text: A Salesman with a chin-mike speaks non-stop, unintelligible
text: Chinese. A frenzied crowd gathers around him, waving money,
dialog: placing bets.
dialog: 
text: Two men sit at either end of a long table. They are in deep
text: shadows, facing each other. We only get glimpses of them: One fat.
text: Mirrored sunglasses. Chinese. His fingers tap on the table. A
text: cockroach scurries past. Ammo belts. A sheathed combat knife the
dialog: size of your arm. .45 automatics in holsters.
dialog: 
text: The other, dressed in black. An eye-patch. Dangerous. A flash of
text: two six-guns in holsters. A futuristic gunfighter. The cockroach
text: dashes past his fingers. WHAP! He squashes it.
dialog: 
text: The crowd goes nuts, placing bets, yelling and screaming in a
dialog: dozen languages.
dialog: 
text: The salesman places three different shaped, clear shot glasses in
text: front of the two men. Then he leans over to...
dialog: 
text: A VAT OF POISONOUS SNAKES. He reaches in, grabs a cobra, pulls it
text: out. The cobra hisses and squirms. Deftly, the salesman continues
text: to talk non-stop into his chin-mike as he milks the cobra venom
text: into the first glass.
dialog: 
text: He pulls out an ice-pick, jabs it into the snake's throat, and
text: bleeds a thick green-white liquid into the second glass. Finally,
text: he slits open the cobra with a large knife, and cuts out the heart
text: and liver. Tossing aside the dead snake, the salesman squeezes the
text: heart and liver with his fingers. The juice drips into the third
dialog: glass.
dialog: 
text: Now the salesman stirs the glasses. The poison is clear. The blood
text: is milky-green. The heart and liver are red. He places the glasses
text: on the table between the two men.
dialog: 
text: The two men stare at each other, motionless. The crowd continues
text: placing bets at a fevered pitch. A titanium white tube floats
text: above the center of the table. A laser beam of light shines from
dialog: one end.
dialog: 
text: The salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger,
text: sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle, the light
text: circling the room before stopping on the fat man's forehead.
dialog: 
text: The fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses. His hand shakes
text: slightly. He hesitates. Finally he takes the glass with the red
text: liquid (the heart and liver), lifts it to his lips, pauses, then
text: gulps it down.
dialog: 
text: The crowd explodes. More bets.
dialog: 
text: The salesman leans over and spins the light tube again, this time
text: it lands on something black, an eye-patch. Pull back to reveal a
text: man with an eye-patch.
dialog: 
text: The man with the eye-patch reaches forward, his hand paused
text: between the remaining two glasses. He takes the one filled with
text: milky-green blood and downs it fast. The crowd roars.
dialog: 
text: One glass left. The two men stare at it intently.
dialog: 
text: The salesman spins the light tube with more force than before. It
text: circles again and again, slowing down, speeding up, finally
text: stopping on the fat man.
dialog: 
text: The salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd, shouting at
text: the fat man. The fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison.
text: His trembling fingers hover above it. Then he quickly withdraws
text: his hand.
dialog: 
text: The crowd reacts, boos, as...
dialog: 
text: The man with the eye-patch smiles. A slightly, cynical smile. And
text: without hesitation, he reaches out, grabs the glass of poison, and
text: drinks it down. The crowd surges forward, but the salesman stops
text: them with a sweep of his arm. All bets are off.
dialog: 
text: The two men stand from the table. Take several steps away toward
text: the end of the alley. Stand facing each other. Two gunfighters.
dialog: 
text: Flashes of the two men. A piece of a black military boot. A hand
text: positioned over a six-shooter. Mirrored sunglasses. A sweaty,
text: trembling lip. And the eye-patched man's one good eye, blue and
text: clear, staring - hard and calm as a sunny day...
dialog: 
text: The draw. It happens in an instant. The alley thunders with
text: gunfire. The guns buck and flash. Then silence. The two men stand
text: there for a beat, until one of them, the fat man, slumps, falls
text: face first into the alley, dead.
dialog: 
text: The crowd goes completely ape shit as SNAKE PLISSKEN emerges from
text: the shadows of the alley, holsters his guns, grabs his take of the
dialog: money...
dialog: 
text: SNAKE PLISSKEN. Long hair. A black eye-patch. A tight-lipped
text: grimace. The impression of coiled aggression and intense cynicism.
dialog: The toughest, most dangerous man on planet earth. A legend.
dialog: 
text: PLISSKEN strolls out of the alley into the crowd. He counts his
text: money, pockets it, as a cigarette girl approaches him. PLISSKEN
text: stops her, pays for a pack of cigs. As she eyes him...
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSEUP OF PLISSKEN'S ARM
dialog: 
text: ... the cigarette girl touches him, pricks his skin with her
text: fingernail. A drop of blood appears.
dialog: 
text: PLISSKEN turns, stares after her, as the sound of helicopters
text: rises from above in the night sky. The crowd suddenly starts to
dialog: disperse.
dialog: 
text: Helicopter searchlights blast down on the street. PLISSKEN is
text: suddenly caught in the glare. He starts to move away...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KACLANG!
dialog: 
text: Out of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere.
text: The net slams down on top of PLISSKEN, trapping him, driving him
text: down to the pavement with its weight... PLISSKEN struggles inside

text: down the ramp. Plissken is bruised, badly beaten and tortured, his
text: face a mess, but he doesn't seem to care. A line of battle-ready
text: cops stand with their guns aimed right at Plissken's head as he is
text: marched into camp. An army of camcorders move ahead of the Police

dialog: bunker entrance.
dialog: 
text: The deportees are minorities, the poor, prostitutes, pimps,

speaker_heading: POLICE VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: You are sentenced to permanent expulsion

dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE ANCHOR
dialog: The whole world's watching. Every good and

dialog: 
text: Plissken's expression is blank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE ANCHOR
dialog: What would you say to all of us who

dialog: 
text: The cell door opens. Malloy, Brazen, and the 3rd Man enter the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAZEN
dialog: Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences,
dialog: then tried to erase them. She missed this
text: fragment on the end of her last tape.
dialog: Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR
dialog: master data bank - and then went prowling
dialog: around for innocent blood, someone

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Sad story. You got a cigarette?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: Shut up, Plissken.

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: What's the little black box do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: Top secret. Only on a need to know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: That's right, big shot. Unless you do what
dialog: we want you're not coming back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A.,
dialog: find the President's daughter, secure the
dialog: box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm
dialog: free?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: That's the deal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll

dialog: 
text: After a couple of beats, the 3rd Man appears next to Malloy and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: 3RD MAN
dialog: If you bring out the prototype, you'll
dialog: receive a full pardon for every immoral

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: It's the President, for Christ's sake!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: I give you my word. Put the prototype into
dialog: my hands, and you're a free man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: I can see you're real concerned about your
dialog: daughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Well, I'll think it over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: You're running out of time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: Having second thoughts?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in
dialog: me this time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: You don't understand. It's already in you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN'S FACE
dialog: 
text: As an image of the cigarette girl in New Las Vegas flashes
text: suddenly. Her fingernail scratches his arm. He tightens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an
dialog: undercover cop. She injected you with
dialog: incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming
dialog: in your bloodstream. It'll start to take
dialog: effect in 9 hours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAZEN
dialog: It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus.
text: Genetically engineered. 100% pure death.
dialog: Complete nervous system shutdown. You
text: crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not
text: a pretty sight.
dialog: 
text: Plissken takes a step toward him. Malloy holds up a large
dialog: hypodermic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: Of course there's an anti-toxin.
text: Neutralizes the virus immediately upon
dialog: injection.
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN

speaker_heading: MALLOY

speaker_heading: BRAZEN
dialog: Urolite. It'll stun the enemy for several

dialog:

speaker_heading: MALLOY
text: Tracer. Utopia has a kidnap chip implanted

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAZEN
dialog: This clips right onto your 9mm. Ammo

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: There's a war about to be declared, or

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: Third World wants to live like we do - and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: So you want me to take her out?

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Good.

speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: Thought you might try that. First clip is

scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE BAY - NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE

dialog: force.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE WALL - NEWHALL PASS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A door in the wall opens, revealing the circulator tunnel. In a

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - THE VENTURA FREEWAY - NIGHT

text: moving to yellow, into red. He pushes it up to 102%.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY (V.O.)
dialog: Plissken...?
dialog: 
text: Plissken's eye turns back to the computer map in front of him. One

text: toward a building. Plissken pulls hard on the controls.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - UNIVERSAL CITY - THE BLACK TOWER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through

text: wobbling. The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed
text: downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object.
dialog: 
text: KING KONG looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the

text: passing 1950's signage from that film, dodging a rusting Delorean.
text: It slams into the open mouth of JAWS, shattering the model into a
dialog: million pieces.

scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE
dialog:

text: backwards down toward the water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUBMARINE
dialog: 
text: Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The
text: sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear
text: exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps
text: out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up
text: the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the
text: sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing.
dialog: 
text: A bleeping sound. He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the

text: something huge and rounded at the ends.
dialog: 
text: Plissken raises his submachine gun...
dialog: 
text: ... as PIPELINE steps closer. He's a surfer in a black wetsuit.

dialog: 
text: Two old cars come zooming up Mulholland, side by side. Windows
text: down. Guns blazing at each other. They pass Plissken, continue

scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT - RAIN

scene_heading: EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT - RAIN
dialog: 
text: The rain is coming down in a torrent as Plissken makes his way
text: down the hillside. Then, all at once, the rain lets up, then
text: stops. The trees drip with moisture. Suddenly, a huge KATHUMP from
text: above him. Plissken looks back. A huge mudslide is roaring its way
text: down the hill toward him.
dialog: 
text: Plissken races down the hill, but the mudslide cascades downward
text: like a freight train, catches up with him, sweeps him off his
text: feet... and Plissken goes riding down the hill, rumbling and
text: sliding in the mud.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STAND OF TREES - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The mudslide hits a flat area near a stand of trees, spreads out,
text: slows. A completely mud-covered, black Plissken climbs out of the
text: goo. He's dripping with it. His one good eye shines in the
text: moonlight. He takes a couple steps toward the edge of the treeline
dialog: when...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A VOICE (SPINAL) (V.O.)
dialog: Shut-up, fuck! Stop makin' noise!
dialog: 
text: Plissken spins. He's standing right next to SPINAL, the leader of
text: the Black Cowboy Gang. Dressed in black, boots with spurs, black
text: duster, black cowboy hat, he carries an automatic rifle. He looks
dialog: just like Charles Barkley.
dialog: 
text: Plissken looks around, realizes he's in the middle of a small army
text: of Black Cowboys, crouched behind the trees, waiting in ambush.
text: Covered with mud, Plissken blends right in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPINAL
dialog: Take cover, fool.
dialog: 
text: Plissken jumps behind a tree, looks down the hillside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PLISSKEN'S POV - THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
dialog: 
text: Below his position is the Hollywood Bowl. A huge cross is on

dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSER - HOLLYWOOD BOWL
dialog: 
text: A group of white hooded men, the K.K.K., stand in front of the

dialog: 
text: Plissken reacts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPINAL
dialog: Let's take him.
dialog: 
text: A Black Cowboy raises his M79 grenade launcher, as the others

dialog: 
scene_heading: THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
dialog: 
text: A 40mm armor-piercing grenade leaves a blazing fire trail as it
text: rockets toward the burning cross and - KABLAMMO! A fireball blows
text: pieces of the cross into the air. The K.K.K. spin around...
dialog: 
text: A blast of lightning illuminates the Black Cowboys attacking from
text: the hills. They open fire. A K.K.K. Grand Dragon is picked off his
text: feet, buffeted in mid-air, flesh and robe shredded by gunfire. A
text: hail of bullets hits the K.K.K. They return fire, but are
text: overwhelmed. They are hit, jerking and twisting. Fire from the
text: Black Cowboys is withering, racking the hooded figures like bolts
text: of lightning. The Black Cowboys keep advancing, firing, as it
text: starts to rain again.
dialog: 
text: Through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water, the firefight
text: continues. Four K.K.K. leap out from behind a row of seats and
text: jump Plissken, knocking his gun to the ground. In a blinding
text: flash, using hands, feet, and head, Plissken sends them flying. As
text: he reaches down to pick up his submachine gun, he sees that the
text: rain is washing the mud off his body...
dialog: 
text: AND SO DOES SPINAL, who stands nearby, watching as Plissken is
text: washed clean by the rain. Spinal raises his weapon, then stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPINAL
dialog: Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken.
dialog: 
text: Plissken slowly stands, his submachine gun in his hand. Behind
text: them, the firefight is almost over. The K.K.K. scatter into the
dialog: rain...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPINAL
dialog: Hey, what's going down, Snake?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: I'm looking for somebody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPINAL

dialog:

dialog: the Bowl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPINAL
dialog: Say, is it true what they say about
dialog: Cleveland, man?
dialog: 
text: Plissken doesn't answer. He moves on through the rain...

speaker_heading: SPINAL
dialog: Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VINE AVENUE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped
text: again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the
text: distance, the sound of thumping music.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AT HIGHLAND - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Pandemonium! Music blares. It's the old Supremes hit, "Love is
text: Like An Itchin' In My Heart." Crowds dance in the street. It's
text: like a block party. Black, Latino and Native American gangs
text: celebrate. Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic.
text: Plissken moves through the carnival. Gorgeous hookers stand under
text: the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater. The marquee now reads:
scene_heading: "SAFE SEX", "NO CONDOMS NEEDED", "POLYPROPYLENE ORIFICES",
scene_heading: "SATISFACTION GUARANTEED"
dialog: 
text: One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - THE HOOKER
dialog: 
text: Opening her mouth, she gives a sensuous puff. A polypropylene
text: orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a
text: small, pink balloon. She sucks it back in and puckers, kissing the
text: air. Plissken turns, as the sounds of car engines rises.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIS POV - COMING DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD
dialog: 
text: ... is a caravan of vehicles. The crowd parts to let them through,
text: cheering insanely. Plissken ducks into an alley, watches...
dialog: 
text: The caravan passes Plissken's position. Two men on horseback lead
text: a convoy of rumbling, fuming old cars, buses, motorcycles - all
text: scarred and ripped and jerry-rigged - bumps down the Boulevard.
dialog: 
text: Plissken watches from his spot in the alley, as a blonde-haired
text: hooker joins him, rubs his arm. She has no polypropylene, at least
dialog: none that we can see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLONDE HOOKER
dialog: It's winnin' time, baby. How about you and
dialog: I do some celebrating?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: What's going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLONDE HOOKER
dialog: You must be new around here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You look familiar. Have I done you before?
dialog: 
text: Plissken grabs the hooker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: What's happening?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLONDE HOOKER
dialog: Easy, man, easy. It's Cuervo Jones' gang.
dialog: Mescalito Justice. He's the big boss man
dialog: 'round here tonight.
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: He's gonna take down the police and make
dialog: 'em kiss his fine ass.
dialog: 
text: Plissken lets her go, stares...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIS POV - A CADILLAC
dialog: 
text: ... is perched ten feet off the ground on monster truck wheels.
text: Severed doll heads are glued all over the hood, and a large
text: glittering disco ball spins atop the roof, catching shards of
text: light and flicking them back into the night...
dialog: 
text: Behind the disco ball stands the real Cuervo Jones, at least. And
text: there next to him is Utopia. She's dressed in black lace underwear
text: and bra, garters and stockings. A Playboy fantasy. She holds the
text: prototype. Delgado, Cuervo Jones' second-in-command, stands behind
text: her. He is huge and evil. Dressed like Pancho Villa.
dialog: 
text: Plissken stares as the Cadillac passes. The hooker cheers along
text: with the rest of the crowd, and doesn't notice that Plissken's
dialog: moved off...
dialog: 
text: Several motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan. Mescalitos
text: ride with their women slung behind them. As the last bike passes,
text: Plissken darts out of the alley, yanks the woman off the back of
text: the cycle, jumps on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE MOTORCYCLE
dialog: 
text: The Mescalito biker turns to react...
dialog: 
text: WHACK! Plissken takes him out with a head-butt, shoves him off the
text: bike, hops up on the seat.
dialog: 
text: KAVROOM! Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the
text: other bikers, toward the head of the caravan. Plissken zooms
text: along, makes the turn onto La Brea Avenue with the caravan...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LA BREA AND SUNSET BOULEVARDS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: As the caravan turns west onto Sunset, Plissken blasts around the
dialog: corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Coming right behind him are four Mescalitos on Harleys - chains,
text: iron bars, and swords in their hands. Plissken stares up ahead.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIS POV - THE CADILLAC
dialog: 
text: ... is just a few feet away. Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
dialog: 
text: Plissken guns it when suddenly two Mescalitos pull up on either
text: side of him. One of them swings a chain. Plissken grabs it with
text: one hand, and with his other hand, aims his submachine gun and
text: fires! The Mescalito and bike go flying, and Plissken holds on to
dialog: the chain.
dialog: 
text: Atop the Cadillac, Cuervo Jones reacts to the sound of gunfire. He
text: turns to see...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: As the other Mescalito riding behind him swings a chain. Plissken
text: swings his. The two chains snap together, intertwining. Then
text: Plissken squeezes his hand-brake. He screeches to a stop. The
text: Mescalito keeps going, and is yanked over backward by his own
text: chain, off the Harley. Finally the Harley flops over, skids,
text: explodes. Plissken guns it again, takes off after the Cadillac.
dialog: 
text: Two more Mescalitos pull up on either side of Plissken. They take
text: aim at him with their automatic rifles. Plissken pulls a sudden
text: wheelie, lifts the front of his bike up into the air, rides on the
text: back wheel. The two Mescalitos fire - directly into each other.
text: They fall and their bikes go crashing to the pavement.
dialog: 
text: Plissken surges the bike forward, coming up on a Mescalito on
text: horseback who turns and fires. Plissken ducks and the bullet rips
text: through the rear tire. The tire blows and the bike swerves out of
text: control. Plissken leaps from the bike and grabs the back of the
dialog: saddle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE HORSE
dialog: 
text: Plissken pulls himself up behind the Mescalito and wrestles for
text: control of the mount. Plissken grabs the reins and wraps them
text: around the Mescalito's neck, squeezing until his eyes burst.
text: Plissken slams his arm against the Mescalito, throwing him off the
text: saddle, bouncing onto the pavement.
dialog: 
text: Plissken gallops ahead, circling a lasso high above his head,
text: pounding down on a biker. The lasso takes flight and finds it
text: mark, the biker's neck. Plissken pulls the lasso taut, ties the
text: end to the saddle horn, rides his mount parallel to the biker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BIKE
dialog: 
text: With one quick yank to the lasso, Plissken pulls the biker off,
text: jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horse's rump.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE HORSE
dialog: 
text: Takes off down the street, dragging the biker by the neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CADILLAC
dialog: 
text: Speeds up as Plissken moves up to the Mustang five cars behind. He
text: swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk. Plissken climbs up
text: to the roof, leaps on the hood, then jumps to the trunk of the car
text: in front - leapfrogging, jumping to the next car, the next car...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MESCALITOS
dialog: 
text: Lean out their car windows, firing at him, but Plissken keeps
text: moving toward the Cadillac...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY A HAND
dialog: 
text: Reaches out a car window and grabs Plissken's submachine gun.
text: Plissken turns to snatch it back -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHEN CUERVO JONES
dialog: 
text: Leaps from the Cadillac and takes Plissken down to the roof.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Snake Plissken.
dialog: 
text: They struggle. Cuervo raises his machete. Plissken grabs his
text: wrist, flips him over, knocks the machete off into the street,
text: smacks Cuervo in the face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: A BOLAS-SWINGING MESCALITO
dialog: 
text: Comes roaring up on his bike, throws the bolas...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: As the bolas hit him, wrap around his neck, the balls thunking him
text: in the face, sending him flying...
dialog: 
text: KAWHAP! Plissken hits the pavement hard. He skids, rolls, and at
text: last slams into the edge of the sidewalk. The caravan rumbles away
text: down Sunset. The hand in the car window still holds Plissken's
text: submachine gun.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo crouches on the roof, hissing at Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Later, Snake. We finish it later.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Lies there for several beats, then climbs to his feet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIS POV - THE CARAVAN
dialog: 
text: ... disappears up Sunset.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Stands alone in the deserted street. The ruins of a supermarket,
text: cheap motels, liquor stores - all empty, desolate.
dialog: 
text: He looks over to see the broken remains of his pocket walkie.
text: After a beat, he starts moving up Sunset, checking his two 9mm
text: handguns, slipping them into their holsters.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET AND DOHENY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: On the border of Beverly Hills, Sunset stretches off into the
text: darkness beyond the intersection. A slight wind blows litter
text: aimlessly along. There are occasional sounds: Creaks, distant
text: clangs.
dialog: 
text: Plissken approaches the intersection. He carries Utopia's compass
text: homing device. It is silent. The small screen's blank. Then
text: Plissken glances at his wrist watch.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE - WRIST WATCH
dialog: 
text: Three hours gone.
dialog: 
text: Plissken stands for a moment, staring off down Sunset...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Snake Plissken, right?
dialog: 
text: He spins around.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: 
text: Sits in an old beach chair on the sidewalk, a map to the stars
text: sign in front of him. In his late 50's, he's a petty thief, con
dialog: man. He's been hustling tourists and everybody else all his life.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Wow! Snake Plissken!
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie listens to WAYWARD WIND by Gogi Grant on a
text: small, metal-plated portable radio. He clicks off the radio,
text: rises, walks over to Plissken.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: You're a star in your own right, you know
dialog: that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How
dialog: you doin'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Where'd they go?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Man, I'd love to have your autograph,
dialog: Snake.
dialog: 
text: He searches around in his pockets, comes up with pen and paper.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: I've been hearing about you ever since
dialog: that New York deal back in the 90's.
dialog: You're one smooth operator.
dialog: (offers pen and paper)
dialog: Could you sign one to Wolf, one to Death's
dialog: Head, one to Slasher Smith...?
dialog: 
text: Plissken grabs him by the throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Where are they?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man
dialog: with the juice, Snake. Got the President's
text: daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big
dialog: doings.
dialog: 
text: Plissken draws a 9mm and points it at Map To The Stars Eddie's
dialog: forehead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Location.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where
dialog: the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've
dialog: been there, y'know.
dialog: 
text: Plissken releases him, as suddenly the tracer beeps. On the device
text: Plissken sees a small red pulsing dot. West.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Nice little gizmo you got there.
dialog: (whispers conspiratorially)
dialog: Look, Snake. I've got connections in this
dialog: town. You need something, I'm your man.
dialog: 
text: Without a word Plissken turns, walks away down Sunset Boulevard
text: toward Beverly Hills.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Hey - you can't go there, Snake. You can't
dialog: walk through Beverly Hills.
dialog: 
text: Plissken's figure disappears...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET - SIGN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The old Beverly Hills sign. It's been painted over in dripping red
scene_heading: letters: "QUIET - SURGICAL ZONE - STAY OUT"
dialog: 
text: Plissken ignores the sign, keeps walking down a completely dark
dialog: Sunset Boulevard.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken walks past the once-beautiful mansions along Sunset. Now
text: they are dark, ruined.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSER - BEVERLY HILLS MANSION
dialog: 
text: As a twisted, mechanical hand sewn awkwardly to the flesh of the
text: wrist pulls aside a window curtain. The face behind the window is
text: in shadows, but we can just make out its pale, discolored
text: features. The other hand brings up a walkie-talkie...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SENTRY
dialog: (into walkie)
text: Specimen moving west on Sunset.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUNSET AND BEVERLY DRIVE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken moves into the intersection of Sunset and Beverly Drive.
text: The ruins of the old Beverly Hills Hotel are ahead and to his
text: right. He stops, stares down Sunset...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIS POV - A FIGURE
dialog: 
text: Emerges from the shadows. This is the gatekeeper. Strange,
text: mismatched body parts. A black-skinned arm attached to a pale
text: white body. His face is unnaturally smooth - too many face lifts.
text: He carries a torch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATEKEEPER
dialog: Halt!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where are you going?
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: Are you here for the auction?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEHIND PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Figures have suddenly moved out into the street, all with
text: mismatched body parts - heads too large for their torsos, female
text: body parts mixed with male heads, all sewn together with large,
text: uneven stitches. Plissken is surrounded.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GATEKEEPER
dialog: Welcome to Beverly Hills.
dialog: 
text: Plissken raises his gun, starts to move, when suddenly a figure
text: rises behind him out of the shadows...
dialog: 
scene_heading: A MULTI-COLORED FLESH HAND
dialog: 
text: Raises a lead pipe, brings it down hard...
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON PLISSKEN'S HEAD
dialog: 
text: THUNK! He goes out like a light.
dialog: 
text: As Plissken slumps unconscious to the street, the figures move for
text: him. Their arms lock around him, drag him away with amazing speed
text: - a pack of wolves on a deer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - PLISSKEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken bolts awake, to find himself tied to a cross. It's
text: lurching back and forth as though the ground is moving.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RODEO DRIVE - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken is being carried down Rodeo Driveon the cross by a throng
text: of surgical failures. They carry torches. Dressed in tatters.
text: Their faces look only partially human sewn together raggedly.
dialog: 
text: Rodeo Drive is a bizarre marketplace of body parts. The once
text: beautiful storefronts of famous designers are now in shambles.
text: Human body parts are on display like filets of fish on ice.
dialog: 
text: Gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car parts and
text: Armani displays more eclectic, high priced pieces sewn together
text: like sculptures in their windowfronts. A giant rift runs down the
text: street's center. Acrid smoke rises.
dialog: 
text: The throng stops at an intersection, and Plissken's cross is
text: anchored in the middle of the street. Surrounding the intersection
dialog: are patients of every size, age, sex.
dialog: 
text: Plissken looks over, sees another cross being carried up and
text: planted right next to his. A beautiful girl is tied to this cross.
text: This is TASLIMA, 20's, Iranian, the face of a Persian princess.
text: She's dressed in black leather, and basically has an IQ of around
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My
dialog: name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Are you crazy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be
dialog: dead. So are you, Snake.
dialog: 
text: Plissken looks across the street. Our of the ruins of the once
text: famous red door of Elizabeth Arden come an arm of women facialists
text: with acid-burned faces from one-too-many skin peelings wielding
text: knives, saws, horrible-looking carving instruments...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: I can't believe I got caught.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I run with Midnight Jihad. Iranian gang.
dialog: Only they kicked me out, cause I screw up
dialog: sometimes. I forget stuff.
dialog: 
text: Plissken struggles with his bonds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: I left my boyfriend's place tonight, took
dialog: a wrong turn...
dialog: (sighs again)
dialog: Oh, Snake, I'm really kind of out of it
dialog: sometimes.
dialog: 
text: OUT OF THE RED DOOR come more interns and nurses carrying surgical
text: pans and pushing gurneys to collect dismembered body parts.
dialog: 
text: The throng of facialists, patients, interns and nurses surround
text: Plissken and Taslima on the crosses. They move back to the
text: sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly from Plissken
text: and Taslima is about to begin. The gurneys are wheeled into place
text: and set up as large cutting tables. The facialists take their
text: positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh meat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: What are they?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: They live here, used to be like us. But
dialog: after too many silicon implants, their
text: muscles turned to jelly. The only way they
dialog: survive is to have body parts transplanted
text: over and over again.
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills
text: gets out alive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: No screamin' shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Oh no, it's the Doctor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
dialog: 
text: THE DOCTOR, THE SURGEON GENERAL OF BEVERLY HILLS
dialog: 
text: Steps out into the street. He appears incredibly gorgeous, a hunk
text: of a man, put together by the finest body parts available in
text: Beverly Hills - a millennium Fabio - but upon closer examination,
text: he's got no lower jaw. Instead, there is a rusting metal grid-work
text: attached beneath each ear. It never moves. He can actually speak
text: through a metal box attached to his windpipe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE DOCTOR
dialog: 
text: Stands in front of them. He raises his hands to quiet the crowd.
text: He walks around the cross, admiring the beautiful bodies before
text: him. He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand, which is made
text: up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE DOCTOR
dialog: I've never seen more beautiful specimens.
dialog: There will be no auction tonight. These
dialog: body parts will go to those who need them
dialog: the most.
dialog: 
text: The crowd gumbles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Turns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck.
text: With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto
text: his tongue, closes his mouth.
dialog: 
text: The doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward
dialog: Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE DOCTOR
dialog: What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame
dialog: you only have one.
dialog: 
text: A nurse brings over a small step-ladder. The doctor positions it
text: in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face
text: to face with him. The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good
text: eye from its socket with his scalpel tips.
dialog: 
dialog: FFFTTT! Plissken spits the mouth dart!
dialog: 
text: WHACK! The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead. He
text: freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding. He falls
dialog: forward.
dialog: 
text: The scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the
text: rope tied around Plissken's wrist. WHATCK! The rope's cut!
dialog: 
text: Plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other
text: hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off
dialog: the step-ladder.
dialog: 
text: WHUMP! Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time
text: as the doctor hits the pavement.
dialog: 
text: The patients are stunned. Motionless. They stare at their doctor
text: lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly.
dialog: 
text: Snake starts to run...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Snake, help me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNAKE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
text: Almost on a whim, Plissken cuts her free. Then he runs. Taslima
text: follows him.
dialog: 
text: Plissken heads toward a side street, looks over his shoulder, sees
dialog: Taslima following...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Don't follow me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: You need help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Like hell I do.
dialog: 
text: Then Plissken comes to a dead stop.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIS POV - DOWN THE STREET
dialog: 
text: Comes a mass of patients right at him. Taslima grabs Plissken,
text: pulls him with her. They take off down a dark cobblestone
dialog: street...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives
text: chase. They stop at another small alley between two large
dialog: buildings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Down this way.
dialog: 
text: They disappear into the small alley.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL ALLEY - CUL DE SAC - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on
text: either side. Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75
text: foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: This is a dead end.
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: You took us into a dead end!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: I just thought you wanted to get away. I
dialog: didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
dialog: 
text: KACLANK! They turn...
dialog: 
text: The doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from
text: his forehead. Behind him, the patients follow...
dialog: 
text: Plissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Go!
dialog: 
text: He follows Taslima through the window.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the
text: balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting
text: hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters -
text: "CAA" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are
text: wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place.
dialog: 
text: They stop at a dark hallway. Taslima moves cautiously ahead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Be careful of the bald cats. They live in
dialog: these buildings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: The what?
dialog: 
text: Plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands
text: are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw
text: dagger toward Plissken's good eye.
dialog: 
text: Taslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two
dialog: men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Are you gonna stand there? Give me the
dialog: gun!
dialog: 
text: Taslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor
text: fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts
text: three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away.
dialog: 
text: Plissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good
text: measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FIRST FLOOR - REAR EXIT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: They come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: How do we get out of here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Sewers. Come on.
dialog: 
text: She pushes open the door...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails
text: rises. Patients swarm around the building in pursuit.
dialog: 
text: Taslima stops at a sewer grate in the street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Down there.
dialog: 
text: Plissken lifts the grating. Taslima jumps in, followed by
dialog: Plissken...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the
text: sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving
text: chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain
text: seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and
text: run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients
text: overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird
text: whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It
text: gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming
text: and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping
text: back down the tunnel.
dialog: 
dialog: FROM DOWN THE TUNNEL
dialog: 
text: An eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Snake - what is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: How the hell am I supposed to know? This
dialog: is your damn city.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye -
text: floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing
text: larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a
text: blasting, ringing sound. Music!
dialog: 
dialog: It's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC!
dialog: 
text: From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart.
dialog: 
text: On a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an
dialog: optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music
text: blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of
text: the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in
text: jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat
text: is hooked to his belt.
dialog: 
text: He pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the
text: music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He
text: holds the gun on them.
dialog: 
text: Removing his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO
text: BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off
text: the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like
dialog: Los Lobos' lead guitarist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: What're you doing in here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
text: Looking to get out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Which way?
dialog: 
text: With a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken.
text: Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight.
text: With it, he examines Plissken's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: You're Snake Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Yes. Isn't he cool?
dialog: 
text: There is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished.
text: Pendejo Bob extends his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me
dialog: Pendejo Bob.
dialog: 
text: Plissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and
text: footfalls of the patients gets closer...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: Those damn patients are coming back. You'd
dialog: better climb aboard.
dialog: 
text: Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo
text: Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only
text: light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: I use the eye and the music to scare em
dialog: off. They're so whacked out, man, it works
dialog: great. Chased a whole bunch of em right
dialog: off the edge there a few months ago.
dialog: 
text: He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the
dialog: passage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: (she peers over the side)
dialog: How far down does it go?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: Don't know - never do hear em land.
dialog: Earthquake opened it up.
dialog: 
text: The golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INSIDE THE TUNNEL
dialog: 
text: Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and
text: sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up
text: ahead is a door marked: "SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL"
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control
text: center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges
text: and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered
text: with dust and grime.
dialog: 
text: Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children,
text: all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open
text: fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of
text: sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade
text: launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked
dialog: everywhere.
dialog: 
text: The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: I own this whole place. Used to work here
dialog: in the old days. I was right in this room
dialog: when the big one hit. What a mess. We were
text: waist high in shit.
dialog: (turns proudly to them)
dialog: Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed
dialog: at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought
dialog: my whole family, my amigos, down here to
dialog: live with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Gun runners.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: Hey, it's a living, baby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat
dialog: to China, take an airplane to Brazil?
dialog: (looks at Taslima)
dialog: Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place,
dialog: Snake. We got our problems, sure - but
dialog: this is paradise, man.
dialog: 
text: Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to
dialog: Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns?
dialog: Explosives? I can get you a crate of
dialog: hellfire grenades, no problem - five
dialog: hours.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
text: All the sewers are collapsed under Venice.
dialog: You have to go topside. Right up there.
dialog: 
text: He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the
text: darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other,
text: carrying crates of weapons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
text: Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway.
dialog: Just follow the signs. Get off at the
text: Lincoln Exit, turn left.
dialog: 
text: Pendejo Bob interrupts the line of men. Plissken starts up the
text: ladder, followed by Taslima...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss.
dialog: You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime
dialog: at all.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET UNDER SANTA MONICA FREEWAY OVERPASS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate.
text: Taslima follows. The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the
text: sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in
text: heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night.
dialog: 
text: Taslima points to a freeway on-ramp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I
dialog: don't think it's such a good idea.
dialog: 
text: Plissken starts toward the on-ramp. Taslima doesn't move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: The freeways are dangerous.
dialog: 
text: He keeps walking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Goodbye, Snake.
dialog: 
text: Plissken stops, turns back, looks at her - a half-smile. It's as
dialog: close to 'thank you' as he gets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
text: Sun's coming up in a few hours.
dialog: 
text: She walks up to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: UV's gonna be bad today. I have a friend
dialog: who's got a place near here. We can crash
dialog: there if you want, Snake.
dialog: (she moves close to him)
dialog: I'd love to take care of you. Make you
dialog: feel good.
dialog: 
text: Without an answer Plissken turns and walks away...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: As far as the eye can see there are lines of rusting cars and
text: trucks, bumper to bumper like a giant junkyard rush hour.
dialog: 
text: Plissken walks up the on-ramp, onto the freeway. He strides past
text: rows of junked cars. A few of them have people inside...
dialog: 
text: There is a Mercedes rusted to its frame, its driver an 80-year-old
text: in sunglasses, drinking from a bottle. A pickup truck full of old
text: illegal aliens packed in like sardines. Someone cooks from a
text: barbecue grill. An RV. An old man sits in the opened doorway,
text: staring at Plissken as he passes. Two old ladies in housecoats
text: stare at him through the windows.
dialog: 
text: CLICK, CLICK! A sound behind Plissken. He spins, 9mm ready...
dialog: 
text: It's Taslima, running to catch up with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: I changed my mind. I'm going with you,
dialog: wherever you're going.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: (gestures to the cars)
dialog: What the hell is this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: The freeway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: I know that. There are people in some of
dialog: these cars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: It's where they live. I guess after
dialog: everything happened, they just needed to
dialog: do what they'd always done before. During
text: the daytime, they just pull down the
text: shades on their windows and sleep.
dialog: 
text: Plissken continues walking. Taslima catches up...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: What are you gonna do in Venice?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Find Cuervo Jones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a shot rings out. Taslima is struck and falls. Plissken
text: drops between the cars and crawls over to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: Run, Snake...They're coming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
text: She touches his hand and looks at him softly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TASLIMA
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
text: Taslima dies. Plissken stares at her for a moment.
dialog: 
text: More shots ring out - landing very close to him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: FREEWAY EMBANKMENTS
dialog: 
text: From out of the heavy bushes along the freeway storm a dozen
text: Mescalitos moving quickly - firing as they go. Behind them grinds
text: an ancient garbage truck mounted with a 50-caliber machine gun.
text: Atop the truck is Delgado. He wears a flame thrower on his back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Returns fire, rolls under a car and begins crawling. All around
text: him people jump out of their cars, begin firing back at the
dialog: Mescalitos.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE GARBAGE TRUCK
dialog: 
text: Smashes through a rusting Volkswagen, heading straight toward him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Reaches the edge of the freeway, dives for the bushes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: AS THE GARBAGE TRUCK
dialog: 
text: Roars past, firing into the vehicles on the freeway, the people
text: running, screaming...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Clawing his way through the undergrowth, Plissken bursts onto a
text: side street. Behind him come the Mescalitos on foot. Plissken
text: runs, firing back every step of the way...
dialog: 
text: AHEAD ON THE STREET
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, in the blowing mist in front of him, a car screeches
text: into view. It's a perfectly restored, 1966 Cadillac convertible.
text: Candy-apple red. The stereo blasts "Last Night" by the Satellites.
dialog: 
text: And behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Hop in, Snake!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE UNDERGROWTH
dialog: 
text: As the garbage truck bursts through. Delgado is behind the machine
text: gun, blasting away, burning up the street. Bullets are flying
text: everywhere as Plissken runs to the Cadillac and dives into the
text: back seat. He's still not fully inside when Map To The Stars Eddie
text: roars away in a blaze of rubber and smoke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELGADO
dialog: 
text: Takes aim with his flame thrower... KAWHOOSH!
dialog: 
text: A GIANT TONGUE OF FLAME
dialog: 
text: Shoots out from the nozzle like a flaming spear. It streaks down
text: the street, just missing the tail of the Cadillac as it swerves
text: around a corner...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie races along a dark street. Plissken climbs
text: into the front seat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Hey, Snake - that was great. They almost
dialog: burned your ass off!
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie drives like Satan himself. Plissken is
text: almost thrown out as they spin around curves, up onto sidewalks.
text: Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them. Finally,
text: the Mescalitos are left far behind as Map To The Stars Eddie slows
text: down to a cruise of 70.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Too many people know where you're going,
dialog: Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his
dialog: men were back there waiting for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Delgado?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough
dialog: hombre. You don't understand, Snake.
dialog: Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island.
dialog: We're on the move, man. Big time.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DARK INTERSECTION - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Cadillac smashes through an intersection, knocking two old
text: junked cars out of the way.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken jams his 9mm into Map To The Stars Eddie's ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Stop the damn car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: No way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: I said pull over.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: All right. Anything for you, Snake.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Although I was going to take you to Cuervo
dialog: Jones' place.
dialog: 
text: Plissken lowers the gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Where is it?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Right over there.
dialog: 
text: He points. Plissken looks off, as Map To The Stars Eddie hits a
text: button on the steering wheel with his finger.
dialog: 
text: ON THE DASHBOARD
dialog: 
text: A small panel in front of Plissken flips down, revealing a two-
text: inch machine gun barrel. Before he can do anything, four rounds
text: rip straight into his chest, blasting him into the seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Grits his teeth and gasps. His gun drops. Blood runs from four
text: holes in his shirt. His face grows red as he fights for air.
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie pushes the button again and the panel
text: closes up over the barrel.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Pretty neat, huh? This is Cuervo's car. He
dialog: lets me use it sometimes.
dialog: (looks at Plissken)
dialog: Not to worry, Snake. You were just shot
dialog: with a fun-gun. You feel it?
dialog: 
text: Plissken gulps for air.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Pure mesh, man. 100-proof artery choker.
dialog: 
text: Plissken slumps back, collapses in the seat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Like Cuervo says, when the hit pulls you
dialog: down to one inch from death, that is
dialog: living, man.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PLISSKEN'S POV - THE DRUG
dialog: 
text: Kicks in hard. Surreal colors float through the dark, devastated
dialog: streets of Venice.
dialog: 
text: Plissken fights desperately against the drug, but he can't move.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: You should've talked to me first, Snake. I
dialog: could've set this whole thing up. I'm
dialog: actually Cuervo's agent, you know.
dialog: 
text: As Plissken sags, losing consciousness, Map To The Stars Eddie's
text: voice begins to fade...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: And I'd love to represent you, too. We
dialog: could make a bundle together. I know I
dialog: could really help your career...I mean,
dialog: you're a legend and all - but the last
dialog: couple years, man, it's like you've fallen

dialog: 
text: Like a giant, scorched daddy-long-legs, the architectural identity

text: wrecks of old 747s lie twisted and bent across the tarmac.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEHIND IT
dialog: 
text: Surrounded by Mescalitos with torches and guns, sits the former

dialog: 
scene_heading: PLISSKEN'S GOOD EYE
dialog: 
text: Opens. Looks around fuzzily.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: He is in Cuervo Jones lair. Huge. Torch-lit. Plissken lies in the
text: center of the room, chained to a treadmill. He is surrounded by
dialog: Mescalitos.
dialog: 
text: In one corner of the room is lots of high-tech equipment.
text: Computers. A VR simulator. Most of the Mescalitos are gathered
text: around a big screen TV. They watch the 207th Annual Academy Awards
dialog: from Carefree, Arizona.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones strides toward Plissken. Map To The Stars Eddie
text: scurries along at his side.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't
dialog: I? All I'm asking for is what you
dialog: promised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: We'll see.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones stops in front of Plissken. Sees that he's awake.
text: Holds out a glass filled with red liquid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Carrot juice?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: Laced with tequila, Snake. Good for you.
dialog: No?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: Your health.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones downs the carrot juice. Plissken lifts his head,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: You're coming out of it, Snake. It hurts
dialog: real bad.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's good.
dialog: 
text: He kneels down next to Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Dying isn't good enough for you. You need
dialog: pain. You'll never make it to where you
dialog: want to go without a little pain.
dialog: 
text: He stands, considers Plissken for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So
dialog: typical of American idealism. The old
dialog: west, Snake.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones tosses the glass to Map To The Stars Eddie. He's
text: beginning to enjoy the moment, performing for Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
text: Man against the sky. The individual.
dialog: Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much
dialog: in America, Snake. You remind them of what
dialog: they used to be.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones walks to a door, opens it. Beyond is a huge courtyard
text: filled with people - families, teenage runaways, the elderly,
text: illegal aliens, orphans - people with nowhere to go. They are
text: being fed and cared for by Mescalitos.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Here is the real L.A., Snake.
dialog: 
text: Plissken lifts his head to see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: The poor. The old. The lost. People
dialog: without hope.
dialog: 
text: He crosses back to Plissken...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Do you know what they want? One word.
dialog: Liberation.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They want a chance to live - before it's
dialog: all gone. They've been hated for too long
dialog: -
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Now it's their turn.
dialog: 
text: He gestures to his men, who move to Plissken and begin carefully
text: unlocking him from the treadmill.
dialog: 
text: Still wobbly, Plissken crawls to his feet...
dialog: 
text: As Utopia comes bounding up from the big screen TV. Still dressed
text: in her racy underwear, she gives Cuervo Jones a kiss. She still
text: carries the prototype with her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best
dialog: Actress.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones reaches out to take the prototype from her. She holds
dialog: on to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: You said I could hold it.
dialog: 
text: He yanks it out of her hands, more violently than she expected.
text: Recovering, she casts a contemptuous glance at Plissken.

speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: Who's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES

speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: Ooww!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Go on now. Do as I say.
dialog: 
text: Plissken watches as Utopia walks away, out of the terminal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: I'm going to show her what it means to be
dialog: a woman - for the first time in her
dialog: pathetic little life.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs
dialog: love.
dialog: 
text: He moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: You want to hook up with us? Join the

dialog: tomorrow night.
dialog: (holds up the prototype)
dialog: We're gonna rule the world. Come with us,

dialog: 
text: Plissken says nothing. His good eye glares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish

dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with

dialog: 
text: Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man
text: steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELGADO
dialog: You're mine now, Snake. All mine.
dialog: 
text: Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming
text: machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his
text: wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just
text: barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor...
dialog: 
text: Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet.
text: Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and
text: wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA-
speaker_heading: CLANG!
dialog: 
text: Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself
text: through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick
text: right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the
text: machetes CLANKS to the floor...
dialog: 
text: Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises...
dialog: 
text: WHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws...
dialog: 
text: THUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at
text: it in horror, then crumbles to the floor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top
text: and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by

dialog: 
text: Above, on top of the terminal, see a figure move.

scene_heading: PARKING LOT - A MESCALITO GUARD
dialog: 
text: Stands watching the caravan pull away. He doesn't see the wire

dialog: 
dialog: Beat. Beat.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - THE FORUM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken's in the backstage area, near the locker rooms. Hear
text: cheering from the main arena. Slowly Plissken moves to a door,
text: opens it, steps out...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORUM HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The cheering is louder is Plissken makes his way along the dingy
dialog: hallway.
dialog: 
text: Now the sound of gunfire from someplace up ahead. Plissken tenses.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly from down the hallway come two Black Muslims carrying a
text: body on a stretcher. As they pass, Plissken notices the body is
text: wearing a bloody basketball uniform full of bullet holes.
dialog: 
text: He moves forward...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORUM ARENA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken peers into the main arena. A basketball game is underway.
text: The Korean Dragons sit on one side, the Black Muslims on the
text: other. They cheer wildly for their respective teams. Pipeline is
text: in the crowd, enjoying the game...
dialog: 
text: Plissken moves closer, among the crowd along the baseline. The
text: whole place is lit by torches and clumsily-wired lighting. Above
text: his head is the shot clock, slowly ticking down.
dialog: 
text: There's blood everywhere on the floor. The referees wear bullet-
text: proof body suits and helmets. Trainers with stretchers stand by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE SHOT CLOCK

dialog: 
dialog: Ticks down: 3 - 2...
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE BLACK MUSLIM
dialog: 
text: Pulls up into a jump shot, releases the ball into the air. It
text: sails through the basket just as the horn goes off, beating the
dialog: 24-second violation.
dialog: 
text: The Black Muslim crowd cheers. The Korean Dragons sit down.
dialog: Plissken watches...
dialog: 
scene_heading: CUERVO JONES, UTOPIA AND THE OTHERS
dialog: 
text: Moving through the seats on the Korean Dragon side of the court.
text: Map To The Stars Eddie stands near the baseline, listening to the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE REFEREE
dialog: 
text: Hands the ball to a Korean Dragon guard. The Korean Dragon
text: dribbles the ball down court, into the corner and passes it off.
dialog: The Korean Dragons can't get a shot off...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE SHOT CLOCK
dialog: 
text: Above Plissken's head ticks down: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1... HONK!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE KOREAN DRAGON
dialog: 
text: Guard still has the ball - the shot clock horn has gone off - 24
dialog: second violation.
dialog: 
text: A whole row of Black Muslims with rifles stand up, take aim, and
dialog: fire!
dialog: 
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
dialog: 
text: The Korean Dragon guard is riddled with bullets. He falls dead on
text: the floor. The Trainers with stretchers quickly collect his body
text: and hurry off the court.
dialog: 
text: Ball boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: (sound of effect of breaking
dialog: glass)
dialog: Shot clock!
dialog: 
text: The Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming! "I Love L.A."
text: begins playing on the loudspeaker.
dialog: 
text: The players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot
text: like the black leather that Plissken wears. One of the players,
text: JAMAAL, notices Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMAAL
dialog: Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother
dialog: Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.
dialog: 
text: The other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand,
text: thumping chests, high-fiving each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMAAL
dialog: Welcome aboard, Snake.
dialog: 
text: But Plissken pays no attention. He sees:
dialog: 
scene_heading: CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
dialog: 
text: Sitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the
dialog: court.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSER - CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
dialog: 
text: Sit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce
text: man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face.
text: Utopia watches the game while the two men confer. Cuervo Jones has
text: a firm grip on the prototype.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: The time is now. We are the strongest. If
dialog: we go together, the others will come.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We go for everything, Xi-Ping. But we go
dialog: together. What do you say?
dialog: 
text: Xi-Ping nodes. They clasp hands...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps
text: into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good,
dialog: cold eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking
dialog: it out in trade. I need a favor...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMAAL
dialog: Sure, Snake. Anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: I need to get across the court now...
dialog: without drawing attention to myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMAAL
dialog: Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore
dialog: thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake.
dialog: Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's
dialog: kick some butt!
dialog: 
text: The players knock fists. Plissken puts on a do-rag. Yelling, they
text: move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMAAL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: You play much pick-up ball, Snake?
dialog: 
text: Plissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMAAL
dialog: Whatever happens, watch the shot clock,
dialog: man.
dialog: 
text: The referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the
text: ball. The game is underway.
dialog: 
text: Plissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover.
text: They go into a set play.
dialog: 
text: The game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu. Players use
text: slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands. It's full
dialog: combat.
dialog: 
text: The Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him. Plissken knocks him
dialog: flat. No foul.
dialog: 
text: Utopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: It's that weird guy again.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit...
dialog: 
text: Plissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them... when
text: suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAMAAL
dialog: Snake! Shot clock!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE SHOT CLOCK
dialog: 
dialog: Ticks down: 4 - 3 - 2...
dialog: 
text: A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at
text: Plissken. Cuervo Jones watches expectantly...
dialog: 
text: Plissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot. The horn
text: sounds just as it leaves his hand...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BASKET
dialog: 
dialog: Swish. Nothing but net.
dialog: 
text: The Korean Dragons sit back down, put away their rifles,
text: disappointed. Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their henchmen
text: quickly leave. The Black Muslims go crazy, and Plissken dashes
text: toward one of the exits. He stops, sees...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: 
text: With his portable radio, trying to get out of the arena, hiding
text: behind a crowd of Dragons. Plissken races through the crowd, grabs
dialog: Map To The Stars Eddie.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Hey, Snake, man... Great shot!
dialog: 
text: Without hesitation, Snake whacks him across the jaw. Map To The
text: Stars Eddie goes down like a sack of laundry. Plissken grabs him
text: by the collar, drags him off toward an exit...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FORUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their men rush out to the
text: caravan of waiting vehicles. Xi-Ping has his own armada of
text: vehicles and an army of evil-looking guards. Cuervo Jones pulls
dialog: Xi-Ping aside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: That man in black. He's very dangerous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: XI-PING
dialog: One eye?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Yes. We gotta dump him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: XI-PING
dialog: What does he want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: (glances at the prototype)
dialog: I'm betting the cops sent him in. Man, I
dialog: do not need this. I got a war to win.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER EXIT - THE FORUM
dialog: 
text: As Plissken drags Map To The Stars Eddie out into the night,
text: crouches behind a row of cars, watches Cuervo Jones' caravan start
dialog: their engines.
dialog: 
text: Plissken shakes Map To The Stars Eddie, waking him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Where are they going?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me,
dialog: Snake. I can help you.
dialog: 
text: Plissken shoves the barrel of his pistol up against Map To The
text: Stars Eddie's temple.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Bankrupt City. The Happy Kingdom.
dialog: (beat)
text: Snake, Cuervo's hooked up with Xi-Ping. He
dialog: is primetime, man - Mister Bad News. The
dialog: rest of the city's joining up with 'em.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're shit outta luck, Snake.
dialog: 
text: Plissken reaches into a pocket, comes out with the large black
text: clip, slips it on his 9mm pistol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: I could've helped you. We coulda made a
dialog: deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
dialog: 
text: Without looking, Plissken slams his elbow into Map To The Stars
text: Eddie's jaw with a WHACK! He flops unconscious on the pavement...
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones' caravan led by that huge Cadillac on monster wheels,
text: moves away from the Forum toward an exit. Plissken moves after
text: them, ducking behind the row of cars...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FORUM EXIST
dialog: 
text: The caravan picks up speed as it approaches the exit...
dialog: 
text: Plissken appears behind an old truck, just as the Cadillac moves
text: past him. He crouches on the balls of his feet, and as the rear of
text: the Caddy drifts closer, he springs...
dialog: 
text: And grabs on to the rear bumper. The monster wheels spin like
text: huge, black scythes on either side of him. Plissken reaches under
text: the Caddy, finds a purchase on the undercarriage, and swings under
text: the Cadillac. He hangs dangling above the street by one hand as
text: the caravan pulls out onto Manchester. With the other he raises
text: his 9mm and aims it at the undercarriage, right about where the
dialog: front seat should be...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The front seat explodes, bullets screaming upward through the
text: leather seats, tearing and shredding fabric and flesh, killing the
dialog: driver and Xi-Ping instantly!
dialog: 
text: In the back seat sit Cuervo Jones and Utopia. The Caddy begins to
text: swerve, the wheel spinning. Cuervo Jones lunges forward across the
text: seat and grabs it.
dialog: 
text: Under the Cadillac, Plissken continues to fire: BLAM, BLAM, BLAM,
speaker_heading: BLAM!
dialog: 
text: The front seat disintegrates. Metal, leather, padding fly
text: everywhere. Cuervo Jones ducks against the door, covering his face
text: with one hand, still grasping the wheel with the other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAWHUMP!
dialog: 
text: The entire front seat and floor underneath it fall down out of the
text: Cadillac and hit the street below. The bodies of the driver and X-
text: Ping flop under the monster wheels.
dialog: 
text: Plissken swings over to the hole and pulls himself up into the
text: opening that used to be the front seat. Cuervo Jones stares at him
text: in total shock, but before he can speak...
dialog: 
text: Plissken rips the prototype out of his hands! Then jumps into the
text: back seat next to Utopia. Then grabs her and turns to the side
text: door. Cuervo Jones releases the wheel for a moment, turns to grab
dialog: Plissken...
dialog: 
text: But Plissken opens the side door, kicks it wide, and with Utopia
text: under his arm, slides across the seat...
dialog: 
text: ... and sails out of the Cadillac...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: Plissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on
text: top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly.
text: Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the
text: Caddy... but fails. The Cadillac careens off the street, slams
text: into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a
dialog: hot dog stand.
dialog: 
text: ON THE ROOF OF THE MESCALITO CAR
dialog: 
text: Plissken and Utopia roll and tumble. He still has a hold of her,
text: and she fights him tooth and nail...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: Lemme go...!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INSIDE THE MESCALITO CAR
dialog: 
text: The driver swerves, hits the brakes... and the car hops the curb,
text: slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PLISSKEN AND UTOPIA
dialog: 
text: Are thrown forward. They tumble off the roof... across the hood...
text: and land on the sidewalk in front of the car. They roll to a stop,
text: as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the
text: caravan suddenly puts on its brakes.
dialog: 
text: Screaming tires. Cars jackknifing, spinning in a massive traffic
dialog: collision...
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac.
dialog: 
text: Plissken drags Utopia into the street, grabs the lid of a manhole
text: in the street, pries it up...
dialog: 
text: Mescalitos pour out of their vehicles, as Cuervo Jones charges
text: into the street, pointing at Plissken...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Kill him, kill him...!
dialog: 
text: Plissken lifts Utopia to her feel, hauls her over to the manhole
text: opening, and dives inside... just as the Mescalitos open fire! The
text: street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot
dialog: lead...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain. He gets
text: to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through
text: the water. The sound of gunfire echoes above them...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones and the Mescalitos charge the open manhole as Map To
text: The Stars Eddie appears groggily shuffling up the street from the
dialog: Forum...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: (grins to himself)
dialog: Good thinkin', Snake.
dialog: 
text: He heads off down the street...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWER TUNNEL
dialog: 
text: Plissken and Utopia race along through the water. He literally has
text: to drag her with him. They turn a corner, go down another slimy
dialog: drain away from the main tunnel...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The black belly of the sewer system. Plissken and Utopia move
text: along, slow as they come to...
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE SHEER, PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF
dialog: 
dialog: One side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our
dialog: journey with Pendejo Bob.
dialog: 
text: Plissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop-
text: off, his eye burning into her...
dialog: 
text: Her feet reach the very edge.
dialog: 
text: Plissken holds her there. Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror.
text: She gulps air in staccato bursts...
dialog: 
dialog: Beat. Beat.
dialog: 
text: Plissken can't do it. He can't push her off.
dialog: 
text: He releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one
text: of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: My... father sent you... didn't he?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He sent you to kill me...
dialog: 
text: Plissken raises the pistol. She's dead in his sights.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: Didn't he?
dialog: (begins to cry)
dialog: 
dialog: But Plissken can't. He can't kill her. The toughest man on planet
dialog: Earth can't kill this 17-year-old runaway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: Plissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun. He stares
dialog: at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Get out of here.
dialog: 
text: Utopia wipes her eyes, confused, afraid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: I said go!
dialog: 
text: Slowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off, starts away
text: down the tunnel, then stops, looks back at Plissken. She stares at
text: the prototype in Plissken's hand...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: Don't take it back. Don't give it to him.
dialog: Please. Let me have it.
dialog: 
text: Plissken glances at the prototype, then at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: What does this thing do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: (her eyes grow wide)
dialog: No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KABLAM!
dialog: 
text: Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh!
text: He spins, drops the prototype...
dialog: 
text: ... as Map To The Stars Eddie emerges from the darkness of the
text: sewer tunnel. He holds a gun in one hand, aims...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KABLAM!
dialog: 
text: He fires again, hits Plissken's leg.
dialog: 
text: Plissken staggers backward toward the edge of the drop off, as Map
text: To The Stars Eddie moves quickly forward...
dialog: 
text: ... and snatches the prototype from the wet floor.
dialog: 
text: Plissken's gun hand is useless, numb from the shoulder wound. He
text: slowly, painfully transfers the pistol to the other hand, tries to
dialog: raise it...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: So long, Snake.
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie takes aim - a head shot ...
dialog: 
text: Plissken spins, and dives off the edge...
dialog: 
dialog: ... down into the drop off...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN'S BODY
dialog: 
text: Airborne. Falling through black space. Down, down, down, straight
text: to hell below, until we can't see him anymore as the darkness
text: swallows him up...
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie steps to the ledge, looks down, as Cuervo
text: Jones and his Mescalitos slog up through the tunnel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Where is he?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
text: He jumped. Down there.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed
dialog: Plissken.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones looks over the edge, at the silent blackness below.
text: Then he turns to Map To The Stars Eddie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Give it to me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: You said I could be Vice-President,
dialog: Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: (extends his hand)
dialog: Give it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it
dialog: all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your
dialog: girl back, I got it all. Just for you,
dialog: Cuervo. Just for you.
dialog: 
text: Dead silence. Cuervo Jones stands with his hand extended. Finally
text: Map To The Stars Eddie gives up, starts to hand Cuervo the
dialog: prototype...
dialog: 
text: ... but slips on the wet floor...
dialog: 
text: ... and drops the prototype with a CLANK!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE - PROTOTYPE
dialog: 
text: A red light comes on, blinks urgently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROTOTYPE VOICE
dialog: (tiny, filtered)
dialog: I am now armed and ready for use. Use
dialog: extreme caution. The location of the
dialog: effected blast area can only be determined
text: by the orbital position of the SatStar
dialog: Ring.
dialog: 
text: Everyone in the tunnel is frozen, unable to move. Slowly Cuervo

dialog: smile...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: This is turning out to be my lucky day.
dialog: (stares coldly at Map To The

dialog: Get this asshole outta here.
dialog: 
text: Several Mescalitos grab Map To The Stars Eddie, pull him back
text: along the tunnel.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Cuervo, wait. Please...
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones turns to Utopia, who stands numbly staring off at the
text: drop-off. He walks over to her, then slaps her hard, viciously,
text: across the face.
dialog: 
text: Utopia reacts to the stinging slap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: Cuervo...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: You're my woman, you understand? You don't
dialog: let anybody take you away from me without

dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: I tried...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: (in her face)
dialog: Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you
dialog: give your life. You fight till you're

dialog: (screams)
dialog: Understand?
dialog: (shakes her)
dialog: Understand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: Yes...
dialog: 
text: He shoves her down the tunnel...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Let's go.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: POV - THE SKY

text: Above Manchester and the Forum is filled with helicopters. All

scene_heading: EXT. SKY VIEW OF L.A. BY NIGHT

dialog:

dialog: 
text: They're like buck teeth, sheered off and crumbling, stuck up in to

text: a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers. They're
text: watching a futuristic big-spin lotto on a large screen TV. The

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT
dialog:

speaker_heading: DARKNESS
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DARKNESS
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE DARKNESS
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE - PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: ... The light hits Plissken's good eye...
dialog:

speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: Hey, Snake. You okay?
dialog: (unhooks the lariat)
dialog: I heard gunfire down here...
dialog: (begins to swing the rope)
dialog: Never been down this far before...

text: jerks the line hard. Plissken is in mid-swing, and the rope
text: jerking pulls him abruptly in the opposite direction...
dialog: 
text: Plissken's boot slips out of the wire mesh...
dialog: 
text: And Plissken falls like a brick, stops abruptly as the line
text: catches, and swings against the side of the pit. He dangles with
text: only his one good arm holding on to the rope.
dialog: 
text: Pendejo Bob pulls the line upward, straining against Plissken's
text: weight. Slowly Plissken rises, a tug at a time, hauled up the edge
text: of the pit toward the cave above...
dialog: 
text: ... when suddenly he passes another opening, a storm drain below
text: Pendejo Bob. He swings into the drain, grasps the side with his
text: hand, and pulls himself in...
dialog: 
text: Pendejo Bob stares down at his rope disappearing into the side of
dialog: the pit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: Hey, Snake...where are you?
dialog: 
text: Plissken crawls into the slimy drain, pulls the rope off of him.
text: Ahead in the darkness is the rushing of water. He turns on weak
text: legs, back toward the pit behind him. Bleeding. Numb in one hand.
text: His leg on fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: (yells)
dialog: I'm in another opening... Storm drain...
dialog: There may be another way up to you...
dialog: 
text: Plissken crawls along the drain. The sound of rushing water gets
dialog: louder.
dialog: 
text: He comes to the edge of the drain. Right below him is another
text: drain filled with water rushing through it like a river.
dialog: 
text: Plissken is stuck. He turns, in great pain, and starts back toward
text: the pit... when suddenly everything starts shaking. Booming. It's
text: a small earthquake, a pre-shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNAP!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the concrete bottom on which he stands gives way, cracks,
text: disintegrates...
dialog: 
text: And Plissken falls backward into the rushing water, and is pulled
text: suddenly downstream into the drain, disappearing from sight...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: 
text: Stands silently above, listening...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PENDEJO BOB
dialog: Snake...
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: Snake!
dialog: 
text: Booming. The whole pit shudders, shaking. Another earthquake.
text: Pendejo Bob drops the rope, turns and dashes away down the
text: vibrating storm drain...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STORM DRAIN - WILSHIRE CANYON - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Black oil-slicked water rushes in the moonlight, out of a huge
text: opening in what appears to be a canyon wall.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE DRAIN
dialog: 
text: As an arm shoots out, clutching the edges of the drain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Emerges from the hole, slides out, tumbles down to a water-filled
text: canyon bottom. He lies there for a moment, trying to focus his
text: eye. Stabbing pain in his shoulder and leg. Finally he rises
text: unsteadily to his feet, looks around, trying to get his bearings.
text: He finds himself at the bottom of...
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE WILSHIRE CANYON
dialog: 
text: Straight down Wilshire Boulevard is an enormous canyon, a river
text: bottom gouged out of concrete in the big earthquake. At least 30
text: feet deep, it is a vast trough leading past skyscrapers and
text: buildings above, off into the distance.
dialog: 
text: Plissken warily glances at his watch: 1 hour 10 minutes to go.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Plissken is struck by a pair of headlights. Pipeline's
text: dune buggy comes bumping along the canyon bottom, sloshing through
text: water, pulling up next to Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Snake. Saw you at the game tonight. Great
dialog: shot.
dialog: (stares at him)
dialog: You look like shit.
dialog: 
text: Plissken hobbles over to the dune buggy as Pipeline gets out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: You feel those pre-shocks, Snake?
dialog: 
text: Pipeline unties the various surfboards he has lashed to the rear
text: of the buggy. He lifts one down and slings it under his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Could be a big one comin' any minute
dialog: now...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Long gone. You'll never catch up with him
dialog: now, Snake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The
dialog: whole town's gonna be there. Things
dialog: changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not
dialog: the same as the old days, man.
dialog: 
text: A thumping sound skyward. More choppers thunder over them, on
text: their way southeast. Plissken grabs Pipeline with his good hand...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Take me there...
dialog: 
text: But he's too weak. His hand slides off. Plissken sinks to his
text: knees. Pipeline stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need
dialog: help.
text: (bends down, helps Plissken
dialog: to his feet)
dialog: You should talk to Hershe. She hates
dialog: Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they
dialog: split up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo
text: Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that
dialog: way.
dialog: 
text: Pipeline points down the canyon to the east.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: She's connected with the Black Cowboys,
dialog: and they don't take shit from nobody...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly that booming, shuddering rumble begins. The canyon starts
text: to shake. The water in the canyon floor sloshes wildly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Yo', man. It's a big one.
dialog: 
text: And the earthquake hits like a roaring sledgehammer. The walls of
text: the canyon crack. Plissken and Pipeline are thrown to the ground.
dialog: 
text: Skyscrapers above them on Wilshire rock and tremble in the quake.
text: Pieces of the building sheer off, fall. A parking garage caves in.
dialog: 
text: Thunder shakes the earth around Plissken and Pipeline. The canyon
text: floor splits open. Water pours into the cracks. Huge boulder-sized
text: chunks of concrete tumble down the canyon walls.
dialog: 
text: And then suddenly it all stops.
dialog: 
text: The booming subsides. The earth stops shaking. Plissken and
text: Pipeline get to their feet, look around. The water around them
text: continues to slosh about violently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Tsunami, Snake.
dialog: 
text: His eyes wide, a smile on his face, Pipeline hurries over to the
text: dune buggy, grabs another surfboard from the back, hands it to
dialog: Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Surf's up big time.
dialog: 
text: Now there is another deep sound rising, coming from the west
text: behind them: A bass roar that slowly climbs from the very bottom
text: of the register upward, as if some massive wall of doom were on
dialog: its way...
dialog: 
text: Pipeline kneels, positions his surfboard in his hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Get ready, Snake. It's gonna be some kinda
dialog: ride.
dialog: 
text: Plissken looks behind him...
dialog: 
scene_heading: POV - THE FRONT EDGE OF THE TSUNAMI
dialog: 
text: Is blasting down the Wilshire Canyon, coming right for them. It is
text: a 25-foot wall of ocean water, moving fast, bellowing like a
text: thunderclap.
dialog: 
text: Plissken sees he can't climb out of the canyon in time, moves over
text: to Pipeline, kneels down...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Let the front edge pick you up. Don't get
dialog: on your board till it peaks.
dialog: 
text: Behind them, the tsunami slams along the canyon, coming right for
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Don't lose it, man. You slip off your
dialog: board and it's the Big Wipeout, you know
dialog: what I mean?
dialog: 
text: The roaring is so loud it's like being on the inside of a cannon
text: barrel. The tsunami is 100 feet away... 75 feet... 50 feet... 25
text: feet... It rolls up right behind them...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Hang on, Snake!
dialog: (yells)
dialog: YAAAAAAA!!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE FRONT EDGE
dialog: 
text: Of the tsunami sweeps under them. Pipeline and Plissken push off
text: from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a
text: cow catcher on a train. The water sweeps them up until they
dialog: disappear under the blackness...
dialog: 
text: Until suddenly Pipeline pops up on top of the tsunami, riding on
text: his surfboard, arms outstretched, feet braced.
dialog: 
text: And then Plissken pops up beside him, surfing clumsily on top of
text: the tsunami wave, kneeling on his surfboard.
dialog: 
text: They blast down Wilshire Canyon at 80 miles an hour. Plissken is
text: wobbly on the surfboard, but he manages to stay on top of the
text: wave. Finally, he gets the hang of it, glances over at Pipeline,
text: who grins from ear to ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIPELINE
dialog: Awesome, Snake. AWESOME, man!
dialog: 
text: Plissken looks up ahead...
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIS POV - MOVING THROUGH WILSHIRE CANYON
dialog: 
text: Five feet from street level. An old van speeds along what's left
text: of Wilshire Boulevard, right on the canyon's edge. It veers around
text: debris in the street, changes lanes suddenly, hell bent for
dialog: leather.
dialog: 
text: Plissken and Pipeline move closer and closer to the van as the
text: tsunami sweeps them along.
dialog: 
text: Now they move alongside the van and Plissken stares over...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSER - THE VAN
dialog: 
text: Behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie, driving like a
text: lunatic, his teeth bared and set, madder than shit.
dialog: 
text: Plissken's eye widens, burns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: (to Pipeline)
dialog: See you later.
dialog: 
text: And suddenly Plissken shifts his weight, and the surfboard tips
text: and slides sideways, across the surface of the tsunami all the way
text: over to the edge, right next to the van. Map To The Stars Eddie
text: glances to his left...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIS POV - PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Is surfing the tsunami not 10 feet away from him.
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie stares in absolute horror. Plissken tips
text: the board again, and slides another 5 feet closer...
dialog: 
text: AS MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: 
text: Jams the pedal, and the van screams forward...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AS PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Stands up and leaps from the surfboard...
dialog: 
text: For a moment he is airborne, leaping across the gap to the van...
text: and slams into the side of the van. He grabs on to the roof, hangs
text: on with one hand, his body whipping against the rocking, bucking
text: side. Map To The Stars Eddie starts swerving, trying to throw
dialog: Plissken off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VAN - WILSHIRE BOULEVARD
dialog: 
text: The van shoots back and forth across Wilshire, Plissken dangling
text: inches from the tsunami-filled canyon. Plissken pulls himself up
text: and crawls onto the roof...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE VAN
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie pulls his gun, cocks it...
dialog: 
text: When suddenly Plissken's hand snakes down from the roof, reaches
text: in the driver's window, grabs his hair, and slams his forehead
text: into the steering wheel with a THOCK!
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie goes out like a light. He slumps over in
text: the seat... but his foot is stuck on the accelerator.
dialog: 
text: Plissken grabs the wheel with his left hand, and manages to steer
text: the van from the roof. The van lurches wildly, hits a chunk of
text: concrete in the street, skids, fishtailing violently from the
text: impact. It smashes against the curb, screeches and bumps along
dialog: concrete.
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie's foot is bumped right off the accelerator,
text: and the van slows to a wobbling, grinding stop.
dialog: 
text: Plissken slowly climbs down from the roof, opens the driver's
text: door, shoves Map To The Stars Eddie out of the way, and jumps in.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VAN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Plissken pulls out into the street and speeds off down Wilshire.
text: Map To The Stars Eddie starts to come around.
dialog: 
text: Plissken grabs his gun, cocks it, puts the barrel up against Map
text: To The Stars Eddie's temple just as he comes to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Listen up. I need directions. Downtown.
dialog: Somebody named Hershe.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Sure, Snake. No problem.
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: You gonna kill me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Later.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot
dialog: you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God,
dialog: man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Cease fire with the bullshit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks
dialog: down, turn right.

scene_heading: CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Does he know how to activate it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRAZEN
dialog: What about Plissken? He could still be -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Forget him. He's dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: That may not be true, Mr. President.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead
dialog: so many times I can't count. But he never
dialog: stays down.
dialog: 
text: A long beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait

scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. VICTORIAN SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
dialog:

text: A heavy mist rises from the pool's surface and hangs over
dialog: everything.
dialog: 
text: At the far end is a group of people. Spinal and the Black Cowboy
text: Gang. Boots, spurs, dusters, and guns.
dialog: 
text: Mojo Dellasandro. Jamaican Voodoo witch doctor. A brutal, scowling

text: Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie approach.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Hey, Hershe. How're you doin'?
dialog: 
text: The woman turns and faces them. This is HERSHE, an absolutely

text: as a woman but talks in Isaac Hayes' voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPINAL
dialog: (eyes brightening)
dialog: Hershe - it's Snake Plissken.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Yeah, Hershe. I brought him to see you.

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: I need a favor.

speaker_heading: HERSHE
dialog: What's in it for me?

speaker_heading: HERSHE

speaker_heading: SPINAL

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Don't lie to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERSHE
dialog: All right, so I made another deal.

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN

speaker_heading: SPINAL

speaker_heading: HERSHE

dialog: I see your point. What's the favor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: (looks at his watch)

speaker_heading: HERSHE

dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERSHE
dialog: So whoever has it runs the show.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: They were gonna use it on South America,

speaker_heading: SPINAL

speaker_heading: SPINAL

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN

speaker_heading: SPINAL

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN

speaker_heading: HERSHE

speaker_heading: SPINAL
dialog: Shit.

speaker_heading: HERSHE

scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Yeah, kinda.

scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN

text: Gliding through the air, as the wind picks him upward. He arcs
text: away from the street level, up toward the remains of the downtown
text: skyscrapers. Behind him, one after another, the group takes off
text: into the wind, diving, rising with the wind.
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie makes a rapid suicidal dive right down

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TOPS OF SKYSCRAPERS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The group of hang gliders sweep past the buildings. A bracero
text: family is having dinner by candlelight two feet from the edge of a
text: sheer precipice, as the side of the skyscraper they live in has
text: been torn off. They wave to Plissken as he passes.
dialog: 
text: Two floors down, someone has hooked up huge speakers and a
text: croaking male voice is singing a Barbra Streisand hit to a
dialog: background track.
dialog: 
text: A beautiful girl in a sheer diaphanous gown dances far out on a
text: narrow girder, waving a scarf at the moon.
dialog: 
text: Plissken and the others now fly in formation, like avenging bats

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: An army of vehicles and people pour into Disneyland - but it's a
text: Disneyland gone to hell. A huge sign reads: "THE HAPPY KINGDOM"
dialog: 
text: The gates no longer exist. The overhead tram lies broken on the
text: ground. Slowly vehicles drive straight inside...
dialog: 
text: A battered old limousine carries Cuervo Jones and a grim-looking
text: Utopia past the ruins of the train and around the ghost-town
text: square of Main Street. Ahead is the fairy castle, broken and
text: crumbling, like some relic from a nightmare. Around it are the
text: thrill rides, tossed in to a jumbled mass by the force of the
dialog: original earthquake.
dialog: 
text: Crowds are waiting. Gangs of every conceivable description. Ethic
text: gangs. Female gangs. Gangs of children. Also families with
text: hangers-on. As soon as the limousine appears, the crowds begin
text: cheering.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones stares out at the masses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: They're simple people. They love a party.
dialog: (turns to Utopia)
dialog: We're gonna throw them one hell of a party
dialog: when we get to America. Right?
dialog: 
text: Utopia is silent, sullen. Cuervo raises his hand to her and she
text: jumps, cowering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Put a smile on your face.
dialog: 
text: A terrified smile spreads across Utopia's face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: As the limousine inches down Main Street, suddenly a wall of
text: headlights pop on. 100 or so battered old vintage Chevys rev their
text: engines, begin bouncing up and down wildly on hydraulic lifts.
text: Gangs begin cheering, firing their weapons into the air like New
dialog: Year's Eve.
dialog: 
text: At the end of Main Street is a huge open area - almost an arena,
text: beyond which are parked a literal army of helicopters.
dialog: 
text: As the limousine stops, and Cuervo Jones emerges, Utopia on his
text: arm, the cheering begins, a wall of sound through the park. Three
text: Black Muslims step out to greet Cuervo, dressed in turban-like
text: headgear and sunglasses, wearing black capes and carrying old
text: Thompson machine guns. They stop, give the right-handed power
text: salute. One of them, BIVOUAC, speaks to Cuervo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIVOUAC
dialog: Cuervo Jones. Welcome, my Brother.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones turns to the crowd, extends his arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Are you ready for the New World?
dialog: 
text: And the loudest, longest cheer you've ever heard goes up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES ABOVE DISNEYLAND - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: 
text: Glances at his wrist watch. Only 20 minutes left. Map To The Stars

dialog: Is that what I think it is?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE

scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - THE ARENA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones leads Utopia toward a large attack helicopter out in

text: Suddenly shooting down out of the sky is a screaming, yelling, Map
text: To The Stars Eddie diving out of control, eyes wide as he passes
dialog: Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Cuervo. Hey, man, I made it! I made it!
dialog: Wait for me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAWHUMP!
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie crash lands into the ruins of a fast food

dialog: 
text: A beat or so later he staggers out of the rig, dizzy and confused.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Hey Cuervo...
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones turns to Bivouac.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Would you please kill him for me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIVOUAC

dialog: 
text: Bivouac raises his machine gun...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Cuervo, wait! I got news. There's about to
dialog: be an attack.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo holds up his hand, stopping Bivouac. Everyone tenses. Map
text: To The Stars Eddie races over...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's
dialog: Plissken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: You told me he was dead.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: I thought he was, but he came back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Where?
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie moves close to Cuervo, out of breath,
text: looking like he may faint...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Oh Cuervo...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: (stalling)
dialog: It's so good to see you again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: Where's Plissken?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: He's... near.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: You're stalling, Eddie.
dialog: (grabs him)
dialog: Talk, you little gringo!
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: (eyes wide)
dialog: Cuervo, look out behind you!
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie suddenly grabs Cuervo as if to protect him,
text: and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in Cuervo's hand.
text: At the same moment Bivouac and the Black Muslim open fire on an
text: old storefront behind Cuervo Jones. The place is shredded.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones pulls Map To The Stars Eddie up off the ground, and
text: grabs what looks like the prototype out of his clutches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUERVO JONES
dialog: You've lied to me for the very last time.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones pulls out a pistol, cocks it, aims at Map To The
text: Stars Eddie's face...
dialog: 
text: KABLOOM! No, not the pistol. A huge explosion rocks Main Street.
dialog: 
text: WHOOSH! Suddenly out of the night sky Spinal and the Black Cowboys
text: dive right down across Main Street.
dialog: 
text: KABLAM! Another explosion sends everyone scurrying for cover.
dialog: 
text: Spinal pulls the pin on a grenade, throws it...
dialog: 
text: BLAMM! BLOOM! Explosions erupt everywhere!
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones grabs Utopia, turns to run toward to the lead
dialog: helicopter when...
dialog: 
text: Plissken roars down out of the sky and his him full force. Cuervo,
text: Plissken and the hang glider go tumbling and crashing in a heap.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SERIES OF FAST CUTS:
dialog: 
text: Chaos and pandemonium. Hershe dives down over the gangs, ripping
text: hellfire from his automatic rifle.
dialog: 
text: People running. Explosions.
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie grabs Utopia.
dialog: 
text: Plissken and Cuervo Jones get to their feet and have at it!
dialog: 
text: Through flames and running people Plissken and Cuervo battle.
dialog: 
text: In Cuervo's hand is a long black knife. Just as he's plunging it,
text: Plissken steps aside and grabs him. Locked together, they battle
text: savagely.
dialog: 
text: The knife cuts Plissken's chest.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo moves for Plissken's throat.
dialog: 
text: Plissken smashes him in the face.
dialog: 
text: They both grip the knife in a deadlock.
dialog: 
text: From above, Spinal dives down and hurls a grenade. Cuervo and
text: Plissken disappear in a huge flash of fire and smoke as the
text: grenade erupts out of the pavement nearby.
dialog: 
text: When the smoke clears, three things are on the ground. Plissken.
dialog: Cuervo Jones. The prototype.
dialog: 
text: Instantly Plissken and Cuervo dive for the prototype. Plissken has
text: it, kicks Cuervo in the face, drags himself to his feet and takes
text: off running (as fast as a man can run with one bullet in his leg)
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie drags Utopia toward the lead helicopter, as
text: Hershe comes in for a landing.
dialog: 
text: Spinal comes in for a landing, continues to throw grenades. The
text: other Black Cowboys land, provide covering fire.
dialog: 
text: Plissken races for the chopper. Behind him, Cuervo Jones is on his
text: feet and in pursuit.
dialog: 
text: Hershe opens fire at Cuervo. Cuervo dives behind a smoking,
text: burning Chevy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT
dialog: 
text: As everyone scrambles in. A Black Cowboy is hit by gunfire, slides
text: down the bulkhead and out the door.
dialog: 
text: Plissken jumps in the left seat, takes the controls. Utopia and
text: Map To The Stars Eddie both climb in the right seat together. The

dialog: in power.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE LEAD HELICOPTER
dialog: 
text: Rotates, turns around 180 degrees on the ground, pushed by the

scene_heading: THE CYCLIC CONTROL
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER
dialog:

dialog: 
text: In the cockpit, the ship lurches and jumps and slams! Everyone is
dialog: bounced around.
dialog: 
text: The helicopter moves fast now - faster -
dialog: 
text: LOW ANGLE ON THE SKIDS
dialog: 
text: As they rise up, an inch off the ground - then two inches - then a
dialog: foot -
dialog: 
text: Cuervo Jones emerges from the smoke, running ahead of the other
text: gangs, barreling toward the ever-so-slowly rising chopper...
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE LEAD HELICOPTER
dialog: 
text: As it lifts - five feet - climbing...
dialog: 
text: The helicopter pulls away from the charging gangs and Cuervo's

scene_heading: POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN
dialog: 
text: See the Matterhorn ahead, coming closer and closer. Hershe leans

speaker_heading: HERSHE
dialog: We're not gonna make it over the fuckin'

dialog: 
text: The helicopter moves right toward the edge of the Matterhorn, 15

dialog: feet... 5...
dialog: 
text: The helicopter wobbles over the top of the mountain, the right
text: skid catching on the Matterhorn's edge! A horrible cracking sound,
text: and the right skid is ripped off from its front mounting, hanging
dialog: half off the ship!
dialog: 
text: On the ground, Cuervo Jones jumps into one of the waiting
text: helicopters as now the gangs race into ships and begin lifting off

scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: I couldn't make the switch, Snake. I don't

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: Now we're even, Snake.
dialog:

speaker_heading: HERSHE
dialog: Can you land?

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SKY OVER THE SAN FERNANDO SEA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The lead helicopter is surrounded by enemy choppers. Above, below,
text: on either side.
dialog: 
text: Right next to Plissken, Cuervo's chopper pulls up just ten feet
text: away. Cuervo grins out at Plissken evilly, unhooks himself from
dialog: his seat...
dialog: 
text: On the other side, another chopper with Bivouac and the Black
text: Muslims pull up. In the rear compartment, a Black Muslim aims what
text: looks like a huge harpoon gun mounted to the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAWHAM!
dialog: 
text: The line shoots out and a gleaming grappling hook slams into the
text: side of Plissken's chopper, the prongs clawing in, holding. In the

dialog: weapons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: Don't shoot! They can drag us down into

dialog:

dialog: 
text: KABLAM! KABLAM! Gang choppers open fire, riddling the rear

dialog: hit!
dialog:

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: (to Utopia)
dialog: Take the controls!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: UTOPIA
dialog: What do I do?
dialog: 
text: But Cuervo wrenches the door open, grabs Plissken, and pulls him
text: out of the seat. Utopia grabs the controls.
dialog: 
text: The lead helicopter goes wild, lurching and swinging and dropping.
text: Plissken and Cuervo are locked in a death grip, hanging on to the
text: doorway, one foot in, one foot out.
dialog: 
text: Plissken embraces Cuervo and throws them both over the edge...
dialog: 
text: They fall through space, locked together, until...
dialog: 
text: WHAP! They are jolted to a dead stop, swinging in mid-air,
text: Plissken's arm wrapped around the dangling right skid.
dialog: 
text: The lead helicopter bucks and spins and swings, Plissken and
text: Cuervo suspended below, struggling to the death, whipped back and
text: forth by the helicopter's gyrations.
dialog: 
text: In the cockpit, Utopia grabs the controls. The ship is shaking,
text: swinging like a pendulum. Hershe is hit with gunfire, flops in the
text: rear compartment. Map To The Stars Eddie slowly regains
text: consciousness, stares in horror at Utopia.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Where's Plissken?
dialog: 
text: Outside, Cuervo clutches Plissken around the neck, struggling and
text: thrashing. Plissken head butts him, dazing him for a second...
dialog: 
text: KA-CRACK! The dangling skid is breaking loose from its mounting on
text: the helicopter above. Plissken and Cuervo Jones stare up, then at
text: each other, then both begin pulling themselves up the skid,
text: climbing hand over hand, in a desperate race...
dialog: 
text: Both men reach the bottom of the helicopter and leap across to the
text: left skid as the dangling right skid breaks off and falls into the
text: San Fernando Sea. Plissken and Cuervo kick at each other. Plissken
text: slides away from him, looks up... sees the grappling hook stuck
text: into the side of the helicopter...
dialog: 
text: Plissken swings up, straddling the skid. He reaches up and begins
text: prying loose the grappling hook. Cuervo's coming right up behind
text: him, reaching for him, a huge knife in his hands. He raises the
text: knife - when Map To The Stars Eddie leans out of the cockpit door,
text: lowers a gun and aims it right at Cuervo.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: Hey, Cuervo.
dialog: 
text: Cuervo looks at him, starts to say something, eyes bulging...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
dialog: If you get to America - let's do lunch.
dialog: 
text: KABLAM! KABLAM! The shots hit, and Cuervo buckles, falls backwards
text: off the skid, plunging downward toward the surface of the San
dialog: Fernando Sea... KASPLASH!
dialog: 
text: Plissken rips out the grappling hook...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AS BOOM!
dialog: 
text: Map To The Stars Eddie is hit with gunfire, dies, falls out of the

scene_heading: POV THROUGH WINDSCREEN
dialog:

text: Burning, white-sulfurous napalm shells streak across the darkness
text: and hit enemy choppers. The sky around the lead helicopter is
text: filled with explosions, waves of rolling fire, falling flaming
text: wrecks plunging past, as enemy choppers begin to hit the water.
dialog: 
text: It is a dreamlike, slow-motion ballet. Huge black police gun ships
text: circle lazily around the enemy choppers, their flex-guns and

scene_heading: EXT. SMALL CLEARING - NIGHT
dialog:

speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: It's taking all the power we've got to

scene_heading: CLOSE - ROTOR R.P.M. GAUGE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PLISSKEN
dialog: All right, baby. Don't be too rough on me.
dialog: We're gonna land.
dialog: 
text: Plissken slowly drops the collective control. The left skid sets
text: down, and the ship continues to descend, tips, begins to roll.
text: Inside, as the chopper rolls over, Plissken braces himself. As the

dialog: snap off...
dialog: 
scene_heading: FROM BEHIND PLISSKEN - INSIDE
dialog: 
text: Looking out the front, the blades smash through the windscreen,
text: barely missing the top of Plissken's head. Plissken is splattered
text: with glass, a piece of metal debris protrudes from the fleshy part
text: of his biceps. Blood pours. The rear compartment explodes into

text: the cockpit, engulfing Plissken...
dialog: 
text: Outside, Plissken pulls himself out of the door. He is on fire.
text: Dives away from the copper and rolls across the ground just as the

dialog: 
text: Plissken climbs to his feet, smoking, wounded...

speaker_heading: MALLOY
dialog: Hold it, Plissken. Now give us the real

dialog: 
text: Plissken reaches down into his other boot, comes out with Map To
