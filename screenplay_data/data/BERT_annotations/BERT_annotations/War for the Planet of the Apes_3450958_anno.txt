speaker_heading: BLACK SCREEN
text: PRIMITIVE WAR DRUMS POUND OMINOUSLY... as a LEGEND BEGINS:
dialog: Fifteen years ago, a scientific experiment gone wrong gave RISE to a species of
text: intelligent apes... and destroyed most of humanity with a virus that became known as the
dialog: Simian Flu.
text: The word "RISE" lingers, moving toward us as it FADES...
text: With the DAWN of a new ape civilization led by Caesar, the surviving humans struggled to
text: coexist... but fighting finally broke out when a rebel ape, Koba, led a vengeful attack
dialog: against the humans.
text: The word "DAWN" lingers, moving toward us as it FADES...
text: The humans sent a distress call to a military base in the North where all that remained of
text: the U.S. Army was gathered. A ruthless Special Forces Colonel and his hardened
text: battalion were dispatched to exterminate the apes. Evading capture for the last two
text: years, Caesar is now rumored to be marshaling the fight from a hidden command base in
text: the woods... as the WAR rages on...
text: The word "WAR" lingers, moving toward us... TURNING RED as
text: the REST OF THE TITLE FADES UP and the DRUMS ABRUPTLY STOP:
text: WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES
text: We HEAR sounds of nature. Then the quiet SNAPPING OF TWIGS.
text: BOOTS CRUNCHING stealthily through grass. HUSHED BREATHING.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
text: TIGHT CREEPING STEADICAM BEHIND THE HELMETS OF HUMAN SOLDIERS
text: Scrawled on the helmet closest to us are the words "MONKEY
text: KILLER." Others pass through frame: "BEDTIME FOR BONZO,"
text: "ENDANGERED SPECIES"... The SOLDIERS climb slowly up --
text: A STEEP, DENSELY WOODED HILL
text: The troops wear threadbare camo fatigues, dark camo paint on
text: their faces; each bears the hand-drawn insignia "A" on their
text: bodies: some on their uniforms, some tattooed on their arms.
text: Many carry GUNS, others MILITARY-GRADE CROSSBOWS.
text: One of the men comes to a halt, quickly WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Captain...!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The CAPTAIN holds up a hand, signalling the unit to stop. He
text: joins the Soldier, who points up ahead. The Captain peers
dialog: THROUGH HIS GUN SITE to see --
scene_heading: THREE APES AND THEIR HORSES
text: up on a ridge 100 yards away. Two of the APES stand guard
text: furtively, one clutching a spear, the other an automatic
text: rifle -- while the third waters the horses at a stream.
text: The Captain lines up his cross-hairs... when ANOTHER SOLDIER
text: creeps right up behind him, reaching for him... but as the
text: hand lifts into frame, we see -- it's an APE HAND...
text: The ape hand GRABS the Captain's shoulder; startled, he
text: quickly turns -- and the ape soldier (RED) POINTS up to --
text: THE CANOPY OF TREES OVERHEAD -- where another HELMETED APE
text: crouches, hidden, looking down at them -- the ape in the tree
text: POINTS toward the ridge... The Captain follows the gesture to
text: a LONG, LOW TRENCH WALL of logs and stones, disguised behind
text: leaves and branches.
text: Captain turns back to Red, nods; WHISPERS INTO HIS HEADSET:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Echo two-six to command. Colonel, we
dialog: have eyes on three Kong in the north
dialog: woods. A couple of our donkeys think
dialog: there are others here too... Maybe this
dialog: is it, maybe the base is near.
dialog: (listens carefully)
dialog: Yes sir... Yes sir, copy. Over.
text: He clicks off, quickly waves up more soldiers from the rear.
text: They begin pulling weapons and ammo from heavy rucksacks that
text: Red and TWO OTHER APE SOLDIERS carry on their backs. The
text: apes seem subservient, treated as no more than pack-mules.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You! Over here!
text: An ape scurries over; the Captain pulls out a grenade
text: launcher -- turns to the men:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Preacher...
text: PREACHER, a fresh-faced grunt still in his teens, crawls up
text: nervously with his CROSSBOW; the Captain points at the three
text: apes up on the ridge:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: The one with the gun...
text: Preacher NODS as the Captain readies his own weapon, lining
text: up on the partially-hidden trench wall. Beside them,
text: soldiers are sliding BAYONET BLADES onto their rifles...
text: All eyes on the Captain as he counts down silently with his
dialog: fingers. "3... 2... 1" --
text: -- and Preacher fires an arrow into the ape with the gun!
text: The other two apes are just starting to react -- when the
text: Captain sends two grenades screaming across the woods...
text: BLASTING OPEN the trench wall --
text: -- and suddenly SCORES OF STUNNED APES begin chaotically
text: FALLING out from the trench behind it! They TUMBLE off-
dialog: balance, dropping weapons (guns, spears, bows &amp; arrows) as --
text: THE HUMANS OPEN FIRE, picking them off in a hail of bullets,
text: arrows, and grenades. The two apes by the stream jump on
text: their horses, starting to flee, when a SNIPER takes one out!
text: But the APE WITH THE SPEAR manages to escape, SCREECHING in
text: warning as he disappears into the distance.
text: The Captain turns to Preacher and the other men, waving them
text: on -- we can't even hear his voice over the DIN OF BATTLE:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: (COME ON!!)
text: The humans charge up the hill, continuing their assault --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE APE WITH SPEAR ON HORSEBACK RACING THROUGH THE WOODS
text: Hooves pounding dirt! SPEAR drives his horse faster and
text: faster. He CRIES OUT again in warning, his screech echoing
dialog: through the trees --
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
text: THE BATTLE ON THE HILL
text: The apes desperately return fire as they begin retreat, more
text: and more apes cut down by the relentless human onslaught --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 4.
scene_heading: SPEAR ON HIS HORSE
text: still SCREECHING as he tears through the woods -- when
text: suddenly he hears a rising CHORUS OF SCREECHING in response.
text: He pulls his horse to an abrupt stop, seeing...
text: A BATTALION OF APES ON HORSEBACK appearing through the trees.
text: With a final WAR CRY Spear spins his horse, the apes flooding
text: at him, as he leads the charge back toward the battle --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE BATTLE ON THE HILL
text: Preacher (the fresh-faced grunt) frantically fires more shots
text: from his crossbow -- when he sees his hip-quiver is out of
text: arrows, shouts to Red over the noise:
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Reload!
text: Red quadrupeds over, and Preacher starts fishing out another
text: fully-loaded quiver from his rucksack...
text: SLOW ZOOM IN ON RED as he coldly watches the ape massacre.
text: Preacher finishes strapping on the quiver, about to re-enter
text: the fray -- when he -- and Red -- both look up to see --
text: A TRIO OF SPIRALLING SMOKE TRAILS HISSING BALLETICALLY
text: through the air from high above! The trails smack the ground
text: and start to tumble, spewing THICK SMOKE everywhere!
text: Alarmed, Preacher peers up at the SOUND OF HORSES; we see --
text: THE APE CAVALRY ARRIVING ON THE TOPMOST RIDGE
text: The riders swing primitive SMOKE BOMBS in the air, launching
text: them from their slings -- and a second wave of smoke trails
dialog: hits the ground --
text: On his horse, SPEAR SCREECHES to the tide of retreating apes
text: around him -- he RAISES HIS WEAPON, rallying them to stop and
text: join him in a counter-assault --
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW
text: Preacher and the other human soldiers are caught in a DENSE
text: SEA OF SMOKE, gasping, scrambling blindly, unable to see more
text: than a foot in front of their faces -- when TORRENTS OF
text: WHIZZING SPEARS AND ARROWS start to rain down from above!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Preacher recoils in horror as SMOKE-SHROUDED SILHOUETTES of
text: soldiers drop around him, their SCREAMS coming from all sides
text: amidst the WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH of spears and arrows --
text: it's like a hallucinatory nightmare... A disembodied scream
dialog: comes from somewhere in the fog --
speaker_heading: AGONIZED VOICE
dialog: RETREAT!!!
text: Preacher dives to his stomach, clawing for cover -- he
text: TUMBLES violently down into A DITCH.
text: He tries to catch his breath -- turns to find himself face to
text: face with the bodies of fallen soldiers. One is the Captain.
text: The ROAR OF APPROACHING APES grows louder and louder...
text: Panicked, Preacher clambers over the corpses, pulls the
text: Captain's headset off, clicks it on with trembling hands:
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Colonel -Â­ Colonel, do you copy?!
text: An excruciating beat... then a crackle of static... finally a
text: VOICE -- something almost chilling about how calm it is:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (V.O.)
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Preacher -- it's Preacher, sir -- !
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (V.O.)
dialog: Where are you, soldier? I need your
dialog: position.
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: I don't know -- !
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (V.O.)
dialog: (unfazed)
dialog: What do you see?
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: I can't see anything! We lost a lot of
dialog: men, sir -- the captain is dead!
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (V.O.)
dialog: You're in command now.
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Command, sir? I think it's just me by
dialog: myself now!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (V.O.)
dialog: By yourself?
text: The apes noises are terrifyingly close now --
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Sir, I don't think I'm gonna make it...!
dialog: I'm sorry -- I'm so sorry!
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (V.O.)
dialog: (silence, solemnly)
dialog: I understand, soldier. Just kill as many
dialog: as you can.
text: And before Preacher can reply, he peers up to see APE
text: WARRIORS converging around the edge of the ditch, glaring
text: down at him. Preacher freezes, braced for death, and we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A TRACKING POV SHOT - MOMENTS LATER
text: The battle's grim aftermath, an almost surreal vision of the
text: ravages of war. Apes scavenge for weapons, stripping GUNS
text: AND AMMUNITION off the bodies of fallen human soldiers... WE
text: CONTINUE MOVING TOWARD A TRENCH, where APE BODIES are being
text: lifted out and SCORES OF WOUNDED attended to... as we get
text: closer, apes in the recess below look slowly up at us with
text: reverence... We move DOWN INTO THE TRENCH, more and more apes
text: reacting, nudging each other, alerting everyone to our
text: arrival, even the injured raise their heads...
speaker_heading: REVEAL CAESAR
text: as he strides through the trench; the POV was his. He looks
text: older now, but even more imposing. His hardened expression
text: reveals nothing... but in his eyes we see deep pain, as he
dialog: takes in the terrible loss and suffering...
text: He's trailed by TWO GORILLAS, flanking him on either side:
text: his grizzled lieutenant LUCA and a younger, smaller ALBINO
text: (WINTER), who looks overwhelmed by the carnage around them...
text: The three of them finally arrive at an area UNDER earth
text: cover, where they find A GROUP OF HUMAN SOLDIERS on their
text: knees, helmets lowered, hands bound behind their backs.
text: Spear and other ape warriors stand guard. Seeing Caesar,
text: Spear supplicates deferentially.
text: Caesar turns to the prisoners as they lift their frightened
text: eyes to his. We see Preacher among them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: But one soldier's helmet is still lowered. Spear reaches
text: down and yanks the helmet off -- revealing Red. Red
text: defiantly avoids Caesar's gaze.
text: Spear tosses the helmet to Caesar. Caesar examines it, sees
text: the hand-drawn "A." He looks at the other soldiers, notices
text: the same symbol crudely tattooed on one of the soldiers'
text: arms, sees it scrawled on some of the uniforms. His eyes
text: find it again on the front of Preacher's helmet.
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: (nervous, quiet)
dialog: ...it's... Alpha Omega.
text: Caesar just stares; then LANG, a lean female soldier, "A"
text: tattooed on her neck, speaks, quiet defiance under her fear:
speaker_heading: LANG
dialog: Means we're the beginning and end.
dialog: Humanity's survival depends on us.
text: Just then, the apes around Caesar turn, reacting to the
dialog: arrival of --
text: MAURICE, the orangutan. Like Caesar, he's older; there's a
text: weariness in his eyes that suggests the war has taken a toll
text: on his gentle spirit. Caesar turns to his old friend.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (signs gravely)
dialog: [Twenty-two dead. Many more injured.]
text: Caesar glowers at the soldiers. We see Preacher still
text: staring up at him... finally getting up the courage to utter:
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: You're him... You're Caesar.
text: Caesar's eyes go to Preacher, caught off guard.
speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: We've been looking for you for so long.
dialog: We heard you had a hidden command base,
dialog: but we could never find it. Some of us
dialog: were starting to think you might be dead.
dialog: But Colonel McCullough said no, you were
dialog: out here somewhere...
text: Caesar doesn't respond, just keeps glaring at the soldiers.
text: Another soldier (TRAVIS) speaks up -- nerves frayed:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Just kill us already...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: LANG
dialog: Shut up, man --
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What? They're animals, he's gonna
dialog: slaughter us --
text: Caesar slowly steps toward him... Travis falls silent.
text: And at last CAESAR SPEAKS, a dark edge in his voice:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I... did not start this war.
text: The humans all hold their breath, gaping up at him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: The ape who did... is dead. His name was
dialog: Koba. I killed him.
dialog: (then, harder)
dialog: I only fight now... to protect apes.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (steeling himself)
dialog: Yeah? What about him?
dialog: (glances at Red)
dialog: And we got ten more just like him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I know these apes. They followed Koba...
dialog: (looks Red dead in the eye)
dialog: They tried to kill me. They fear what I
dialog: will do to them. They believe I cannot
dialog: forgive. So now they serve you... just
dialog: to survive.
text: Red glares up at Caesar -- and for the first time he
scene_heading: unexpectedly SPEAKS in PRIMITIVE, BASTARDIZED LANGUAGE:
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: I no fear you! You must fear! How long
dialog: you think woods can protect you? Humans
dialog: destroy you. Their Kerna has all power.
dialog: Humans follow all he say. To them, he
dialog: more than just human. He everything.
text: He looks over the apes, who seem chilled... his eyes boring
text: into Winter's; the young gorilla is unnerved --
speaker_heading: RED (CONT'D)
dialog: He say: first Caesar die... then you all
dialog: die.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Spear ERUPTS, hurling Red to the ground -- when Caesar puts a
text: hand up. Spear restrains himself, eyes still blazing.
text: Caesar looks to Luca, then signs:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [Get him out of here.]
text: Luca turns to Winter. Winter gathers himself, then drags a
text: resisting Red away. The humans watch, fearful... then turn
text: to Caesar, awaiting their fate... Luca signs, ominously:
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [What should we do with them?]
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: BOUND HUMAN WRISTS, AS APE HANDS CINCH A KNOT TIGHT --
text: REVEAL PREACHER, LANG, TRAVIS, AND THE OTHER TWO SOLDIERS on
text: a pair of horses, their hands now TIED to the reins. Apes on
text: the ground surround them. Preacher looks at Caesar.
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: You're letting us live...?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Tell your Colonel... you have seen me
dialog: now. And I have a message for him: this
dialog: fighting can stop. Leave us the woods.
dialog: And no more humans will die.
text: The soldiers look at him, fear and defiance in their eyes.
text: Caesar nods to Luca -- who SWATS the horses' hindquarters,
text: sending them on their way. The stunned humans peer back at
text: the apes as the horses carry them off.
text: TIGHT ON CAESAR AND LUCA as Maurice steps up beside them, and
text: they WATCH THE HUMANS GO. Finally, Maurice turns to Caesar:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Do you really think they'll give him the
dialog: message?]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: They are the message. I showed them
dialog: mercy. He will see we are not savages.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Let's hope this works. They are getting
dialog: closer...
text: Just then SHRIEKING is heard -- they turn to see --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A COMMOTION among the apes by the trenches below. Apes start
text: to swarm up toward them. As they near, a distraught Winter
text: is revealed in their midst, clutching his head, BLEEDING --
text: Alarmed, Luca moves for him -- Caesar watches, concerned, as
text: Winter lifts his head, signs to Luca, humiliated and upset:
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: [Red attacked me! He got away!]
text: Winter turns to Caesar, too ashamed to hold his gaze.
speaker_heading: WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: [I'm sorry...]
text: Caesar says nothing, taking in the troubling news; we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - EPIC WIDE SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The procession of ape warriors heads through the woods, led
text: by Caesar on horseback. The able march with the injured,
text: helping them keep up; the dead are carried on the backs of
text: horses. A LOW ROAR builds as we CUT TO --
scene_heading: AN IMPOSING WATERFALL
text: RUSHING down sheer rock-face in an area nestled deep in the
text: woods. The apes have stopped to gather along the river at
text: the base of the falls. Shrouded ape bodies are released into
text: the river. Caesar and Maurice sit side by side, apart from
dialog: the others -- Caesar, troubled:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Why didn't I see, Maurice?
text: Maurice turns to Caesar.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [See what?]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: That Koba could not forgive what humans
dialog: did to him when he was their prisoner.
dialog: That he would seek revenge. I should
dialog: have known.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [No one could have known how much
dialog: darkness was living inside of him.]
text: A SUDDEN HIGH-PITCHED ALERT rings out, almost like a bugle.
text: They quickly look up to --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: THE TREELINE ABOVE
text: where we discover they are far from alone, the trees coming
text: to life as APES EMERGE EVERYWHERE! Hundreds concealed in
text: CAMOUFLAGED GUARD STRUCTURES in trees and all around the
text: falls. A LONE APE blows into a RAM'S HORN, as others
text: communicate to the apes below that someone is coming...!
text: The apes on the ground seize their weapons, standing at the
text: ready, tension building to a fever-pitch when --
text: A SMALL GROUP OF HORSES appears through the trees...
text: Caesar's intense expression suddenly changes, swelling with
text: emotion as he sees --
text: BLUE EYES, ROCKET, and TWO OTHER APES arriving. They look
text: weary, caked with dust, their horses laden with enough gear
dialog: to suggest they've been on a long journey.
text: As they dismount, Caesar and a group of others move quickly
text: to greet them. Caesar stands before Blue Eyes, the two of
text: them just looking at each other, overcome. Everyone watches,
text: giving them their space, when finally Blue Eyes signs:
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES
dialog: [Hello, Father...]
text: A huge smile spreads across Caesar's face and he embraces his
text: son. The crowd celebrates, rushing in to join the reunion.
text: Caesar turns to Rocket, the two happy to see each other --
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Welcome home, Rocket.
dialog: (grins at Rocket)
dialog: You look tired.
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [It was a long journey --]
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES
dialog: (cuts in, excited)
dialog: [Father, we found something!]
text: Caesar looks at him, immediately hopeful.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Come inside!
text: They all start toward the waterfall -- as we CUT TO --
dialog: 12.
text: THE BACK SIDE OF THE WATERFALL
text: DAYLIGHT plays through the ENORMOUS WALL OF RUSHING WATER, as
text: the SILHOUETTES of Caesar and the apes appear in front of it,
text: entering around the edge of the falls. They continue into
text: the cavernous recess as we CUT TO REVEAL we are inside --
speaker_heading: A HIDDEN FORTRESS
text: Like a primitive castle built into the caves, completely
text: concealed behind the waterfall and surrounding rocks. A
text: FLOOD OF CHILDREN converge around them as their MOTHERS run
text: after them, trying to maintain a little order.
text: Blue Eyes looks through the crowd, spots CORNELIA rushing
text: toward him, beaming -- he beams back --
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES
dialog: [Mother...!]
text: -- she pulls him into an emotional hug. They both look down,
text: noticing a TODDLER (CORNELIUS) hiding shyly behind her legs.
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: [Cornelius, don't you recognize your
dialog: brother?]
text: Blue Eyes crouches down, strokes his head. Cornelia grins:
speaker_heading: CORNELIA (CONT'D)
dialog: [Someone else missed you too...]
text: Blue Eyes turns, rising to see -- A YOUNG, FEMALE APE around
text: Blue Eyes' age (LAKE) standing right behind him. Blue Eyes
text: is struck at the very sight of her. She smiles uncertainly
text: as he takes her hands, and they tenderly press their
text: foreheads together.
scene_heading: INT. HIDDEN FORTRESS - COUNCIL ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER
text: CAESAR'S SYMBOL carved into the stone floor; around the
text: symbol sit Caesar and Cornelia, Blue Eyes, Lake, Rocket,
text: Maurice, Luca, Winter and other COUNCIL MEMBERS.
text: A MAP is laid out on the floor; Cornelius presses his face
text: close, watching Blue Eyes' finger as it points to one spot in
dialog: particular:
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES
dialog: (passionately, to Caesar)
dialog: [This is it, Father. We can start over.
dialog: A new home.]
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Cornelia scoops Cornelius into her lap, gently pulling him
text: away from the map -- she looks at Blue Eyes, intrigued,
dialog: points:
speaker_heading: CORNELIA
dialog: [What is beyond those mountains, son?]
text: Blue Eyes picks up a pouch beside him and digs his hand in,
text: removing a fistful of SAND; he spills it out dramatically --
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES
dialog: [A desert, Rocket and I had to cross it
text: too. The journey is long, but that is
dialog: why humans will not find us.]
text: Cornelia smiles, nodding -- she and Caesar exchange a proud
text: look -- when Winter cuts in anxiously:
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: [We must leave tonight!]
speaker_heading: LAKE
dialog: [Tonight? That's impossible!]
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: [How much longer can we wait? Soldiers
dialog: are getting closer!]
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES
dialog: (touching Winter's arm)
dialog: [Winter...]
text: Winter shrugs him off -- Luca and the others all erupt
text: angrily at Winter -- Caesar stands imposingly. Winter
text: immediately lowers his head, afraid; then, to Caesar:
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: [Your son's been gone, he doesn't know
dialog: how hard it's been!]
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES
dialog: [I know you are scared, we all are, but
dialog: we are still planning...]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Yes... We must still find a way to get
text: out of the woods safely.
text: Everyone looks at Caesar as he sits.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: There were two of you. But we are many.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (concurring)
dialog: [The woods are filled with soldiers.]
text: Everyone falls silent. Blue Eyes meets Caesar's gaze:
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES
dialog: Father... We must try.
text: Caesar looks at his son, emotional:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I know, son.
dialog: (he turns to the others)
dialog: More apes die everyday. And we cannot
dialog: hide here much longer.
text: Caesar looks back down at the map, deep in thought; then
text: feels the anxious stares of the apes around him. He looks at
text: them, trying to reassure, though he is still uncertain
dialog: himself:
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: We will find a way out...
text: He raises his fists and brings them together, solemn:
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
text: Apes together strong.
text: They return the gesture, nodding faithfully at their leader.
scene_heading: INT. HIDDEN FORTRESS - CAESAR'S DWELLING - NIGHT
text: A small cave in the upper levels of the fortress, enclosed on
text: one side by the ROARING FALLS. Caesar sits up, awake, as his
text: family sleeps around him. Troubled, he studies Blue Eyes'
text: map in his lap -- when suddenly he feels something...
text: Caesar looks down to see Cornelius instinctively hugging his
text: leg as he rests, nuzzled beside his mother. Caesar gazes
text: down protectively at his little one, strokes his head, then
text: turns to look back at the map -- when he notices Blue Eyes
text: staring up at him through heavy lidded eyes.
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES
dialog: [Can't sleep?]
text: Caesar shakes his head, his worried gaze returning to the
text: map. Finally, Blue Eyes reaches out and touches his father's
text: arm; Caesar turns.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES (CONT'D)
dialog: [Trust me, father. This is a risk worth
dialog: taking.]
text: Moved, Caesar nods; he reaches out and gratefully caresses
text: his son's face, then SIGNS, smiling:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [I am so proud of you.]
dialog: (then)
dialog: [I love you, son.]
text: -- when suddenly a SHIMMERING GREEN LIGHT washes briefly over
dialog: both their faces...
text: Startled, Caesar looks up at the falls to SEE --
text: -- THREE SHAPES distorted surreally in the water, each haloed
text: in green light as they descend rapidly from view.
text: Unnerved, Caesar sits up, unsure of what he's just seen.
text: Blue Eyes watches as his father approaches the falls warily,
text: moving in very close... when Caesar sees a STRANGE THIN LINE,
dialog: whipping about in the current...?
text: He reaches toward THE LINE, mystified -- then plunges his arm
text: deep in the water, grasping for it --
text: -- he pulls the line toward him... revealing a taut section
text: of RED NYLON CLIMBING ROPE, straining against the current...
text: Alarmed, Caesar immediately turns back to Blue Eyes and
dialog: signs, urgent:
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: [Stay here. Protect your mother and
dialog: brother.]
text: Blue Eyes nods with growing concern as Caesar heads out --
scene_heading: INT. DARK CATACOMB - NIGHT
text: We hear the INCESSANT, OMINOUS ROAR of the waterfall as THREE
text: FIGURES enter the rock corridor, shrouded in DARKNESS...
text: The sweeping, green beams of THREE RIFLE'S LASER SITES blink
text: on, one by one, as the figures sneak forward through mist.
text: At a fork in the catacombs, one silently signals for the
dialog: others to go one way; he goes the other...
dialog: 16.
text: IN ANOTHER DARK CATACOMB
text: CAESAR creeps cautiously down the narrow, winding passage,
text: picking up speed... He hugs the wall, rounding a bend --
text: -- when he comes face-to-face with A HULKING FIGURE! Caesar
text: leaps back, startled -- then finds it's Luca. Standing guard
text: with a rifle, the gorilla looks surprised to see Caesar:
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [Sorry, Caesar.]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [How many others on patrol?]
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [Five? Six--?]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [Get them! Rocket too!]
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLUE EYES
text: Crouched behind rocks in the family dwelling. He gestures
text: protectively to Cornelia and the toddler to stay behind him
text: as he anxiously stares at --
text: A GREEN LASER BEAM slowly approaching in the dark rock
text: corridor just outside their cave... a HUSHED VOICE:
speaker_heading: FEMALE SOLDIER
dialog: Lima-two to command. Colonel, intel's
dialog: good. I'm in the target area. Are you
dialog: close?
text: Blue Eyes tightens his grip on a SPEAR in his hand... HOLD
text: on him, as he waits, coiled to pounce --
text: The green glow of the beam spills into the cave, sweeping its
text: interior, getting closer, closer -- when --
text: Blue Eyes SPRINGS FORWARD! STAY ON a terrified Cornelia and
text: the toddler as we HEAR a sudden VIOLENT SCUFFLE, chaotic
text: flashes of green illuminating Cornelia's horrified reaction!
text: The space finally goes quiet, and we --
text: CUT WIDE TO SEE BLUE EYES IN PROFILE, standing over the body
text: of the intruder; it's LANG, the tattooed female soldier, her
text: rifle on the floor a few feet away. Blue Eyes clutches his
text: spear, catching his breath -- when --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A second OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE creeps silently into the f.g....
text: Blue Eyes unaware as another green beam quickly moves up his
text: body, finally coming to rest on the back of his head...
scene_heading: INT. DARK, NARROW CATACOMB - MOVING SHOT - SIMULTANEOUS
text: Yet ANOTHER BEAM scans the pitch black passage as a FIGURE
text: moves stealthily toward us. He WHISPERS into his headset:
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Lima-four to command. Colonel, did you
dialog: get him--?
text: -- when suddenly A SHAPE tackles him from behind -- SMASHING
text: the Soldier against the walls like a rag doll -- SILENCED
text: MUZZLE FLASHES STROBING as the soldier involuntarily pulls
text: the trigger! The space goes black again as the Soldier is
text: dropped in a heap.
text: A SILENT BEAT. Then, approaching TORCHLIGHT flickers on the
text: walls... revealing the shape to be ROCKET; he reaches down
text: and grimly retrieves the gun from the dead soldier on the
text: ground. Rocket looks up as Caesar and Luca arrive with the
dialog: torch.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Rocket! What happened?!
text: Rocket signs urgently to Caesar -- pointing to the body:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [I heard him talking! The Colonel is
dialog: here!]
text: Caesar's eyes go wide -- he takes the torch from Luca, moves
text: down close to look at the body... immediately recognizing
text: TRAVIS, the defiant soldier whose life he spared. Suddenly,
text: an eerie crackle comes back over Travis' headset:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (V.O.)
dialog: 99, target acquired!...
text: Caesar picks up the dislodged headset, raises it to his ear --
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (V.O.)
dialog: ...Repeat, target is down! I got him.
dialog: Let's go! I can get out from here!
text: Caesar's face goes ashen as horror dawns...
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: A HUMAN HAND
text: fishing out the red nylon climbing rope from the waterfall...
text: it starts to clip the rope to an anchor on a belt --
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: BOUNDING FULL-TILT through the corridor, faster, faster --
text: until he bursts into
scene_heading: HIS FAMILY DWELLING
text: Panicked, heart-racing, Caesar's eyes FIND --
scene_heading: COLONEL J. WESLEY MCCULLOUGH
text: Silhouetted by the waterfall as he finishes securing the rope
text: to his belt. He turns to face us -- and Caesar -- for the
text: very first time: a striking, nightmarish image -- his face
text: covered in shocks of dark camo grease, head completely
text: shaved, a full unruly beard, wild eyes just visible behind
text: graduated aviator sunglasses. His presence is chilling.
text: The Colonel's eyes blaze, stunned at the sight of Caesar.
text: Confused, his gaze flits to something on the floor -- Caesar
text: follows his stare to discover --
text: BLUE EYES, LIFELESS ON THE GROUND, CORNELIA DEAD BESIDE HIM.
text: TIGHT ON CAESAR as time seems to stop -- he's reeling, his
text: entire world crashing in -- his eyes lift to the Colonel, a
text: wave of rage rushing over him -- when --
text: THE COLONEL quickly swings his gun off his shoulder --
text: Caesar DODGES FOR COVER behind the rocks -- as --
dialog: The Colonel FIRES --
text: From the corridor we hear the furious ROAR OF INCOMING APES --
text: The Colonel yells into his headset, backing toward the falls:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Get me out! Now!!
text: Then he turns -- and LEAPS STRAIGHT THROUGH THE WATERFALL!
text: Caesar raises his head just in time to see --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: THE COLONEL, barely discernible through the rushing water,
text: clutching the swinging rope -- as HE'S PULLED UPWARD!
text: Apes spill into the cave as Caesar, desperate with rage,
text: jumps to his feet, charging after the Colonel -- the apes
text: watch in shock as -- CAESAR LUNGES INTO THE FALLS TOO -- !
scene_heading: EXT. WATERFALL - CONTINUOUS
text: Caesar crashes through the water, hands flailing for --
text: THE ROPE! He grabs at it -- IT CAREENS WILDLY! Caesar holds
text: on tight, looks up to see --
text: THE COLONEL high above -- clinging to the suddenly jerking
text: line -- he looks down to see
text: CAESAR starting to climb up furiously after him...
text: The Colonel, unfazed, seizes a KNIFE from his boot as --
text: Caesar closes in, climbing, about to reach him -- when --
text: THE COLONEL CUTS THE LINE -- and --
text: Caesar PLUMMETS -- down, down, down -- INTO THE RIVER BELOW!
text: An excruciating beat -- then Caesar SPRINGS UP from the
text: water, gasping, enraged -- he peers up in agony to SEE --
text: THE COLONEL disappearing over the TOP OF THE CLIFF!
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S FAMILY DWELLING - LATER
text: CLOSE ON Cornelia and Blue Eyes, as their lifeless bodies are
text: lifted from the rock floor...
text: REVEAL CAESAR watching silently, lost in his own world; still
text: wet, he remains completely motionless, consumed with rage,
text: pain. Beside him, Rocket, Luca and Maurice watch, shaken, as
text: the bodies are carried away.
text: Just then Spear pushes through, reporting to Luca:
speaker_heading: SPEAR
dialog: [Luca! We can't find Winter. He wasn't
dialog: at his post.]
text: Luca and Maurice suddenly exchange a worried look --
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [He was scared. Could he have turned
dialog: against us?]
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He looks to Rocket as well -- but Rocket's gaze is now fixed
text: elsewhere. Maurice and the others all turn to see --
text: CAESAR has been following their conversation. Finally, Luca
text: signs, wracked with guilt:
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [Caesar... I think Winter betrayed us.
dialog: I'm sorry. He was in my command.]
dialog: Caesar remains silent; then:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: My youngest son... Have you found him
dialog: yet?
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [We're still looking.]
text: Maurice turns to the others:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Let's help them search.]
text: Everyone nods, following Maurice's lead as they shuffle out,
dialog: giving Caesar some much-needed space... Finally --
text: Caesar is alone.
text: His eyes move to where he found Blue Eyes and Cornelia; there
text: is blood on the floor. He steps closer, in a trance; sees --
text: TWO BRASS BULLET CASINGS on the ground. Caesar crouches, his
text: expression intensifying as he reaches for the spent casings --
text: -- when he hears a NOISE behind him -- on a hair-trigger,
text: Caesar seizes the spear, raising it furiously -- so gripped
text: by animalistic rage that it takes a moment to realize -- it's
text: his toddler son, peeking out from hiding in the rocks;
text: Cornelius peers up in terror at his father, shrinking back.
text: Caesar returns to his senses, lowers the spear... then,
text: softening, he bends to the toddler and extends a hand... But
text: Cornelius is still too frightened to approach, his eyes fixed
text: on the spear in Caesar's grasp.
text: Ashamed, Caesar sets the spear on the ground, then holds both
text: arms out to his son.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Cornelius... you're safe now, son.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: The child finally comes, reluctantly... Caesar, growing
text: emotional, pulls him into a powerful embrace. We HOLD TIGHT
text: on CAESAR, pain etched deeply on his face...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK AT THE BASE OF THE WATERFALL - DAY
text: The entire ape community is here, urgently loading up their
text: horses, preparing for the imminent exodus. HEADS TURN as ---
text: CAESAR makes his way through the crowd; clutching a rifle in
text: one hand and holding his little son's hand in the other, gaze
text: fixed ahead as he crosses to --
text: LAKE, who stands by her horse, surrounded by Maurice, Luca,
text: and Rocket on theirs. Caesar looks at Lake. He seems stoic,
text: but his eyes belie heartbreak, and something deeper...
dialog: tremendous rage:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You loved my son. Look after his brother
dialog: until I return.
speaker_heading: LAKE
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: [You're not coming with us?]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No.
text: Caesar crouches down to Cornelius, caresses his little son
text: one last time, then guides him to Lake.
text: ANGLE ON Rocket and Luca; they exchange a look, shocked.
text: Maurice looms behind them on horseback, watching it all too:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Caesar! You're not going after them?!]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Not them... Him.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Caesar, you are our leader! We can't
dialog: leave without you!]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You must. The soldiers will be back
dialog: soon.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Caesar looks for one last time at his son -- Cornelius cries
text: out as Lake tries to comfort him --
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: [Father!]
text: But Caesar remains unrelenting, already completely consumed
text: by his dark, vengeful quest as he starts to head off:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (to the apes around him)
dialog: When I find him, the soldiers will all
dialog: come after me. That may give you the
dialog: best chance to get out of the woods.
dialog: Until then, be safe.
text: And with that he moves straight for his horse. As the
text: reality that their leader is leaving them sets in, the ape
text: community begins to react in anxious protest -- shockwaves of
text: HOOTS rise as Caesar mounts his horse.
text: ON MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA watching Caesar amidst the
text: growing turmoil -- they stare after him in total disbelief...
scene_heading: EXT. WIDE SHOT ON THE APE EXODUS - WOODS - DAY
text: A seemingly endless line of ape refugees. Spear leads the
text: procession; armed apes in warpaint guard the group, parents
text: protectively clutching their children, others help the
text: injured along -- as they set off uncertainly for the perilous
dialog: journey ahead...
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: Caesar rides alone, rifle in hand, the sound of the ape
text: exodus now barely audible in the distance. Suddenly, he
text: hears RUSTLING behind him. He turns, stops, alert. As the
text: sound gets closer, we recognize the CLOP OF HOOVES -- then --
text: MAURICE, ROCKET, and LUCA appear, riding out of the trees.
text: They come to a halt, eyes on Caesar. Caesar returns a hard
text: look, shakes his head. But Luca is undeterred:
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [The soldiers' camp is always moving. My
dialog: guards think they know where it is. Let
dialog: me take you.]
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [You'll need me to back you up.]
text: Rocket reveals a rifle in his hand. But Caesar remains firm:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Please... I know what it's like... to
dialog: lose a son.]
text: That strikes a chord; Caesar looks at him, affected...
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I might not make it back.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [That's why I'm coming. To make sure you
dialog: do.]
text: Caesar looks at his three friends, moved, torn...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A MOVING SHOT - CAESAR, MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA
text: Riding silently through woods, close together. A posse.
text: HOLD on this iconic image of the foursome; then CUT TO --
scene_heading: EXT. LOWER WOODS - SEASIDE CLIFF - LATER
text: The posse making their descent, when they see --
text: SMOKE rising from an old shack across the way.
text: They look at each other, slowing...
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [This is where the guards thought they
dialog: might be. There are always fires
dialog: burning.]
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HANDHELD SHOT - PEEKING THROUGH THE TREES
text: As we move closer, we discover we are at the edge of --
scene_heading: A DESERTED R.V. PARK
text: Old campers lined up, long-since abandoned. Smoke billows
text: from a weathered stovepipe poking through the window of a
text: rusted-out Airstream trailer. The only sign of life.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: REVERSE ON CAESAR, MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCA
text: spying through the trees on foot, looking apprehensive. They
dialog: exchange uncertain looks -- could this be the base camp?
text: They creep out of the trees for a closer look -- when --
text: A LONE MAN carrying firewood emerges from the forest.
text: He's mid-40s, dirty, unshaven. Seeing the apes, he stops in
text: his tracks. They all stare, a silent stand-off... Then,
text: very, very slowly, he starts to lower his pile of wood:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I'm just gonna... put this down --
text: He drops the wood suddenly, revealing a RIFLE strapped to his
text: shoulder -- he whips it around -- and FIRES! The shot JUST
dialog: MISSES MAURICE, when --
text: BANG! THE MAN DROPS DEAD. Stunned, the apes turn to see --
text: CAESAR clutching his SMOKING GUN, staring distantly at the
text: man he's just killed. The others regard Caesar's grim,
text: steady presence, a bit in shock at his seeming lack of
text: remorse; a look in his eyes suggests even he knows something
text: has broken within him. A line has been crossed.
text: Finally, Caesar lowers his rifle -- only now aware of their
text: stares. He turns away, ignoring them, steps toward the man.
text: The others join him, looking down at the body. The tattered
text: rags he wears are barely recognizable as the fatigues worn by
text: the human soldiers. "A" is crudely tattooed on his arm.
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [Is he out here alone?]
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Maybe he's a deserter?]
text: Caesar doesn't respond, eyes on the dead man -- when a MUTED
text: CRASH comes from behind; they all turn to THE AIRSTREAM...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
text: Suddenly a door is ripped open, and light spills in; we are --
scene_heading: INT. RUSTED-OUT AIRSTREAM - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: The faces of the apes slowly appear, gazing warily in at us;
text: Caesar and Rocket have their guns drawn.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: They stalk silently into the dim space, eyes roaming... It's
text: long and narrow, lined with rotted wood panelling, packed and
text: littered with improvised survivalist essentials.
text: We MOVE with them as Caesar leads the group through the
text: claustrophobic interior, anxiously scanning for any place a
text: human might be hiding... Moving inexorably toward...
speaker_heading: A CLOSED DOOR
text: at the far end of the trailer. The others exchange tense
text: looks as Caesar readies his gun -- and SMASHES down the door!
text: ON CAESAR, eyes blazing, furiously training his gun as he
text: sees something; he freezes, poised to kill, and we REVEAL --
speaker_heading: A LITTLE GIRL
text: cowering like a frightened animal against the wall in a lower
text: bunk bed. She looks no more than 8 or 9 years old. A little
text: waif-like figure, her unwashed face is framed by wildly
text: matted hair. She stares wide-eyed up at --
text: Caesar, gun still trained on her, adrenaline coursing through
text: his veins... The faces of the other apes appear behind him,
text: shocked at what they see.
text: Finally, Maurice reaches over, places a hand on Caesar's gun,
text: gently lowers it. Caesar returns to his senses... but still
text: shows no compassion for the human child. He turns away, to
text: the others, gesturing coldly at the trailer behind them:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Look around. Take what we can use.
text: Caesar steps out past them; Rocket and Luca share an uneasy
dialog: look, then follow.
text: But Maurice remains, eyeing the scared little Girl with a
text: mixture of curiosity and pity. He spots something on the
text: floor by the bed, starts to move toward it...
text: Terrified, the Girl scoots back against the wall, withdrawing
text: as far as she can. But Maurice coos a comforting pant-hoot
text: as he reaches down to the floor and retrieves --
text: A CRUDELY-MADE RAG DOLL. He holds it out. She hesitates --
text: then quickly grabs it and retreats to her corner, hugging it.
text: Maurice watches her, then raises his arm, reaching for her.
text: She freezes, nervous eyes following his enormous hand... as
text: his finger straightens... and gently strokes the doll's head.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: She blinks up, studying him, fear ebbing; she opens her mouth
text: to speak, but no words come, just GENTLE, GASPING GRUNTS...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A DUSTY COMPASS IN A BATTERED OLD LOCKBOX
text: REVEAL LUCA picking it up, as he, Caesar and Rocket search
text: the trailer. Luca sees a PAIR OF BINOCULARS in the box; he
text: takes them too, along with some FLASHLIGHTS.
text: Impatient, Caesar looks back, wondering where Maurice is --
text: when Maurice appears in the doorway, the Girl visible behind
text: him, staring out curiously. Maurice signs to Caesar:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Something wrong with her. I don't think
dialog: she can speak.]
text: Caesar looks coldly at the Girl, then back to Maurice:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Come.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERTED R.V. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Caesar and Rocket mount their horses as Luca arrives with the
text: others. Maurice is about to climb up when he notices --
text: The Girl has followed them out. She wanders toward the dead
text: Man, his gun still a few feet away. She stares at him,
text: looking lost, but not quite sad. Instead she exhibits a
text: strange, almost primitive fascination with his lifeless body.
text: They all gaze at her, uncertain. Maurice turns to Caesar:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [She'll die out here alone.]
text: Caesar looks at her, a flash of pity in his eyes... but he
text: pushes it away, turns to Maurice, firm:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: We cannot take her.
text: Maurice considers this, nods.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [I understand...]
dialog: (then:)
dialog: [But I cannot leave her.]
text: Caesar stares at him, frustrated...
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DUSK
text: The posse on the move again. The Girl rides behind Maurice,
text: arms around him, her cheek pressed into his furry back.
text: Caesar takes in the sight, shoots Maurice a hard look...
text: Maurice returns an assuring nod: it'll be okay.
text: Just then, Luca GRUNTS for their attention. They all turn to
text: see CROSSES UP AHEAD ON THE SIDE OF THE TRAIL, crudely-bound
text: branches staked into the ground. They approach warily,
text: stopping as they discover --
text: A LARGE GRAVEYARD amidst the trees. A sea of crosses,
text: marking mounds of dirt. They peer around, a bit unnerved:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Must be where they bury the dead.]
text: Rocket nods, when Caesar suddenly notices the TREE TRUNKS are
text: scarred with BULLET HOLES... He glances at the ground,
text: finding scattered BRASS BULLET CASINGS; perplexed, he points:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Looks like some were killed here.
text: They all look at the shot-up trees and casings, bewildered --
text: when Luca sees a pile of ASHES and CHARRED OBJECTS --
scene_heading: BLACKENED EYEGLASSES, BELT BUCKLES, DOG TAGS --
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [They burned their things too.]
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Why would they kill their own men?]
text: ON CAESAR, mulling the mystery -- when Luca lets out another
text: GRUNT; they turn as he points through the trees at pinpricks
text: of FIRE LIGHT and TENTS in the distance. It's the base camp.
text: Caesar tenses in grim anticipation --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A POV THROUGH HIGH-POWERED BINOCULARS
text: SEARCHING the FIELD OF TENTS in the blue twilight. We FIND a
text: huge "A" stencilled on the side of one of them. Re-focus on
text: HAND-PAINTED SIGNAGE beside it: "Those who forget the past
dialog: are doomed to repeat it." Next to it: "The only good Kong is
text: a dead Kong." An eerie, almost cult-like atmosphere.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: REVEAL CAESAR
text: crouched in brush, spying through the binoculars scavenged
text: from the Airstream. Luca and Rocket are pressed beside him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR'S POV
text: A PAIR OF TURNCOAT APES walk into view -- the binoculars
text: follow them as they cross to an area where LARGE GROUPS OF
text: SOLDIERS are gathered around CAMP FIRES; as the apes begin
text: dutifully pouring drink into the humans' cups, one turns
dialog: toward us -- we recognize him as RED.
text: The apes watch Caesar peering; when suddenly his expression
text: hardens. He slowly lowers the glasses, anger burning...
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [Did you find the Colonel...?]
text: Caesar just hands the binoculars to Luca, who lifts them --
scene_heading: LUCA'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS
text: Beside Red, the OTHER APE HAS TURNED TOWARD US, serving the
dialog: humans... As Luca FOCUSES, we recognize him, as Caesar
text: whispers his name ominously:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Winter...
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
text: We're inside the human camp now. Red and Winter quietly
text: ladle stew from a bucket to Soldiers sitting around the fire.
text: A volatile soldier with tortured eyes (BOYLE) calls out in a
text: low, menacing voice to Winter:
speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: Donkey. Over here.
text: Winter hesitates, flustered -- Red notices, immediately
text: intercedes, anxiously trying to placate Boyle --
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Ok -- Ok... He come...
text: He nods at Winter to hurry over; he does. Boyle holds out
text: his bowl. Winter takes it, filling it quickly -- some stew
text: spills on Boyle's boot --
speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: Hey! Hey! You stupid-- !
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: WHAP! as Boyle KICKS the bowl right out of Winter's hand --
text: and Winter reacts with an instinctive SNARL! Boyle grabs his
text: gun, points it right at him. Winter FREEZES -- then:
speaker_heading: A VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Come on, Boyle...
text: Boyle turns to see PREACHER, the fresh-faced kid, beside him.
speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: Shut up, Preacher -- what're you, a
dialog: donkey lover now? I think you going soft
dialog: coz that kong let you go.
text: Some of the soldiers snicker. Preacher backs down,
text: humiliated and angry. Boyle levels his gun at Winter again.
speaker_heading: BOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get me a new bowl.
text: Winter looks nervously to Red. Red nods soberly: do it.
scene_heading: INT. DARKENED MOBILE KITCHEN TENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Winter digs under a supply table for a new bowl. Rising, he
text: catches his reflection in a grimy mirror over a wash basin.
text: He hesitates, maybe suffering a crisis of conscience -- when
text: he sees A REFLECTED FACE lurking in the shadows behind him!
text: He spins to see CAESAR standing there, motionless, staring...
text: Panicked, Winter turns for the exit -- but LUCA is there,
text: blocking escape. Turns the other way -- and there's ROCKET.
text: Winter's eyes widen as Caesar takes a slow step toward him...
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where is the Colonel?
text: Winter swallows, trembling as he lifts his hands to sign:
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: [He's gone.]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (dubious, stalking closer)
dialog: ...Gone?
text: Winter looks at the other apes, sees them closing in too...
text: Turns back to Caesar, nervously explaining:
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: [This morning. He took many soldiers
dialog: with him.]
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Luca and Rocket exchange troubled glances... but Caesar's
text: eyes remain fixed on Winter as he continues his approach...
speaker_heading: WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: [Men are coming down here Â­- from their
text: base in the north. The Colonel and his
dialog: soldiers are going to meet them at the
dialog: border.]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What border? Why?
speaker_heading: WINTER
dialog: [I don't know. But more of us are
text: leaving to join them in the morning. Red
dialog: thinks they'll all be coming back here...
text: to help the Colonel finish off the apes
dialog: for good.]
text: Caesar finally stops, right in front of him. Winter pleads:
speaker_heading: WINTER (CONT'D)
dialog: [Please... I know I betrayed you. But
dialog: can't you see? We'll never beat them. I
dialog: was just trying to survive. Red told me
dialog: the humans promised to spare us if we
dialog: helped. I beg you, forgive me...]
text: But Caesar is unmoved, barely stifling his rage...
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: My son... my wife... are dead.
text: Just then -- we hear the LAUGHTER OF HUMANS outside; Winter
text: turns, sees SHADOWS OF SOLDIERS passing on the side of the
text: tent -- he opens his mouth to shriek to them -- but a HAND
text: CLAMPS over his mouth, as Caesar wrestles him to the ground
text: to silence him! The others rush in, holding Winter down as
text: he struggles violently, desperately trying to shriek out --
text: The SHADOWS OF THE SOLDIERS HALT, their laughter subsiding as
text: their heads turn toward the muffled sounds in the tent --
text: Seeing this, Caesar furiously tightens his grip around
text: Winter's neck -- but Winter won't stop, struggling even
text: harder! Eyes fixed on the human shadows, Caesar grips
text: fiercely... choking tighter and tighter...
text: ...until Winter finally relents. Caesar watches the shadows,
text: tense... And at last, they move on.
text: The apes exhale relief. Luca and Rocket turn to Caesar --
text: but their eyes drift to Winter.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Caesar follows their looks down to the young gorilla in his
text: grasp... and discovers he has killed him.
text: Stunned, he stares at Winter's lifeless face... then, slowly,
text: looks up again at Luca and Rocket, grappling with what he's
text: done. They lower their eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. DENSE WOODS - NIGHT
text: Tense silence. The apes and Girl sit by a fire, isolated in
text: the trees; Maurice studies Caesar's face as he gazes into the
text: flames, deeply unsettled. Then Maurice turns to the others,
text: who look equally plagued. Finally, Rocket turns to Maurice:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Winter had it coming!]
text: Maurice nods, uneasy; Luca looks up, convincing himself:
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [Caesar had no choice!]
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [So what do we do now?]

text: Maurice turns again to Caesar, who is still in his own world,
text: lifting a gourd canteen to his lips. He takes a drink...
text: when, out of the corner of his eye, he sees the Girl beside
text: him, staring at him guilelessly.
text: He looks at her askance for a moment, deadpan, then hands her
text: the gourd, and she guzzles thirstily. Caesar watches --
text: -- when suddenly his eyes shift, startled to discover a DARK
text: FIGURE on the other side of the fire...
text: Alarmed and bewildered, Caesar peers through the flames...
text: amazed to see it's AN APE sitting across from him, his head
text: lowered ominously. Fire dances on Caesar's pupils as he
text: stares at the figure, haunted...
text: ...when suddenly, the Ape lifts his face, grinning at Caesar
text: through the distorting waves of heat -- Caesar looks haunted:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: ...Koba?
speaker_heading: KOBA
dialog: Ape... not kill ape...
dialog: 32.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON CAESAR
dialog: snapping awake with a start -- we are --
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - MORNING
text: Caesar catches his breath, lying disoriented on the ground...
text: when he hears activity around him. He turns, finding Maurice
text: standing over him -- he signs urgently:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [The soldiers are going!]
text: Caesar turns to see Rocket and Luca twenty feet away,
text: crouching anxiously behind the trees, peering into the
text: distance -- we hear the APPROACHING THUNDER of horses...
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - MT. TAMALPAIS - DAY
text: A grand vista of Mill Valley in the distance. A SMALL ARMY
text: OF HUMANS ON HORSEBACK DESCENDS on the hills below us... when
text: OUR POSSE arrives in the foreground.
text: Caesar looks with determination down at the humans as they
text: recede... He urges his horse forward; the others follow...
dialog: AND WE DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SIERRA MOUNTAINS - DAY
text: WINDS BLAST SNOW in all directions...
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
speaker_heading: A WHITEOUT
text: Our posse are no more than DIM SHAPES pressing blindly toward
dialog: us, battling the elements, lost...
text: TIGHT ON CAESAR'S EYES squinting hard, fighting to see...
text: He peers into the maelstrom spying -- BRAKE LIGHTS up ahead --
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [Is that them up ahead?]
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: (tense)
dialog: [Looks like they stopped!]
text: Caesar urgently raises his hand to stop his posse --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [Don't let them see us!]
text: He is already off his horse -- when DISTANT GUN BLASTS echo
text: through the air! They all rush to the side of the road,
text: huddling together -- as MORE SHOTS RING OUT up ahead --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: (to Caesar)
dialog: [What are they shooting at?!]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A SILENT, UTTERLY STILL, SNOW-COVERED TRAIL - LATER
text: The blizzard has stopped.
text: With a SOFT CRUNCH of snow, we see our posse ride cautiously
text: into view, eyes anxiously scanning the trail for the presence
text: of the humans... Rocket SIGNS cautiously to the group --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [They're gone...]
text: As he approaches, Caesar sees something -- he stops his
dialog: horse:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (unnerved)
dialog: What is that...?
text: As Caesar and the others dismount, REVEAL SMALL WOODEN X ON
text: THE SIDE OF THE ROAD; they move toward the Xs to discover --
text: THREE BODIES DRAPED IN SNOW. Maurice tucks the Girl
text: protectively behind him, as Caesar reaches down and brushes
text: snow off them... revealing THREE ALPHA OMEGA SOLDIERS, bullet
text: wounds in their backs, HOODS OVER HEADS, execution-style.
text: Caesar pulls one of the hoods off -- the soldier is a WOMAN;
text: her eyes are open, lifeless, dried blood under her nostrils.
text: Rocket pulls off another hood... a lanky, young, MALE
text: SOLDIER, eyes shut. He too has dried blood under his nose.
text: Rocket inches closer to look at his face -- when THE
text: SOLDIER'S EYES SNAP OPEN -- he GASPS at the sight of them!
text: The apes are startled as the panicked Soldier begins
text: frantically scrambling away -- Caesar moves after him --
text: places a hand firmly on his leg --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Why... did they shoot you?
text: He just stares back, blinking without understanding -- when
text: he notices the Girl, staring at him from behind Maurice. The
text: two lock eyes warily, like creatures in the wild. And then
text: the Soldier opens his mouth as if trying to speak... but
text: makes no sound, only GASPING GRUNTS, just like the Girl's...
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (struck; to Caesar)
dialog: [He can not speak either...?]
text: The apes all exchange looks; Caesar turns to Rocket:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Help me get him up...
text: Rocket reaches down toward the Soldier -- but the Soldier
text: freaks, wide eyes darting ferally, wildly scrambling on his
text: back to get away from them -- Caesar moves toward him, trying
text: to calm him -- but it only spooks him more -- he rolls on to
text: his knees and takes off RUNNING...
text: The apes watch, stunned, as he disappears into the woods.
text: Finally, Caesar turns back, looking at the bodies again...
text: and then the Girl. Maurice catches his eye:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [What is wrong with them...?]
text: Caesar just shakes his head: I don't know... And we CUT TO:
scene_heading: ATOP A TALL RADIO TOWER - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Caesar, Maurice, Rocket, and Luca urgently climb into view as
text: snow swirls around them; cold, out of breath, they anxiously
text: scan the colossal Sierra snowscape, stretching out endlessly
dialog: around them --
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Where could they have gone?!]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Winter said they were heading to a
dialog: border...!
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [Yes, but which way is that?!]
dialog: 35.
text: ON THE GROUND
text: The Girl sits on Maurice's horse, craning her neck all the
text: way back to stare up at the apes high above; as she glances
text: back down to play with the rag doll in her hands -- an OUT OF
text: FOCUS FIGURE IN A GREEN PARKA silently passes behind her...
text: CLOSE ON DARK, WEATHERED SNOW BOOTS creeping up and stopping
text: next to the legs of one of the horses --
text: We watch THE BACK OF THE FIGURE'S HEAD, covered beneath the
text: FUR-LINED HOOD of the bulky parka, as his unseen hands
text: rummage stealthily through a saddle-bag. His breath steams
text: quietly around him. He FREEZES as A FLASHLIGHT drops into
dialog: the snow by his boots --
text: But the Girl remains focused on her doll, unaware.
text: The Figure resumes rummaging, finally pausing as we BRIEFLY
text: GLIMPSE the BARREL OF A SHOTGUN he has just found --
text: UP IN THE TREE TOPS
text: A NERVOUS SNORT comes from one of the horses below -- the
text: apes turn to see the TINY FIGURE IN THE BULKY PARKA FAR BELOW
text: digging in the saddle bag; Luca lets out a TERRIFYING ROAR --
text: The Girl finally looks up, startled, as --
text: -- the Figure panics, JUMPING ON THE HORSE, AND TAKING OFF!
text: Caesar and his posse scramble down from the trees -- mount
dialog: their horses --
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
text: THE POSSE GIVING CHASE THROUGH THE SNOWY WOODS
text: GALLOPING THROUGH THE TREACHEROUS OBSTACLE COURSE OF TREES --
text: The TINY FIGURE in the parka darts in and out of view --
text: The apes are starting to gain on him, when he BREAKS OUT of
dialog: the woods and up onto --
scene_heading: A MASSIVE SNOW-COVERED SLOPE
text: We watch from HIGH ABOVE as his horse CHARGES THE INCLINE,
text: KICKING POWDER INTO THE AIR -- the apes' horses burst out of
text: the woods after him -- all of them just tiny dots climbing
text: the stark white landscape...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: From this vantage we can now see the TOPPLED CABLES and
scene_heading: DILAPIDATED GONDOLAS that tell us this was once A SKI AREA --
text: The apes again begin to close the gap --
scene_heading: CLOSE ON CAESAR CHARGING HARD, EYES FIXED ON --
text: THE DIM FIGURE up ahead of him -- when suddenly -- BLAM! -- a
text: FLASH OF GUNFIRE ERUPTS from atop the Figure's horse --
text: CAESAR and the OTHERS DUCK as -- CHING! -- the BLAST
text: RICOCHETS off a half-buried GONDOLA CAR far wide of them!
text: BLAM! BLAM! TWO MORE SHOTS ring out, wildly astray, kicking
text: up snow clouds nowhere near them or their horses --
text: -- as the Figure disappears over the crest of the slope.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF THE SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER
text: The apes arrive, slowing their horses as they come upon --
scene_heading: AN ENORMOUS, ABANDONED VICTORIAN HOTEL, built into the
text: mountainside. An old sign reads: The Inn at Deer Creek.
text: The stolen horse wanders rider-less on the snowy front lawn.
text: The apes cautiously dismount, drawing their weapons... As
text: they approach, a SHADOW SUDDENLY BOLTS from behind one of the
text: buildings, dashing into the main lodge --
text: The apes all exchange looks; then raise their guns as we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE INN AT DEER CREEK - MAIN LOBBY ENTRANCE - DUSK
text: An ornate glass door slowly opens... Caesar, Rocket, and Luca
text: enter, guns first... As they pass us, the door swings shut
text: behind them... HOLD as Maurice and the Girl wait outside,
text: pressing their faces to THE FROSTY DOOR PANE -- their eyes
text: fill with a sense of amazement as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: MAURICE AND GIRL'S POV - PUSHING IN ON THE FROSTY DOOR PANE
text: Inside the lobby, Caesar, Rocket, and Luca creep away from us
text: into what appears to be a kind of SURREAL ICE PALACE...
text: BACK INSIDE THE LOBBY
text: We MOVE with Caesar and the others, their breath steaming in
text: the cold as they peer around them at an extraordinary sight --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Every inch of the cavernous interior -- from furnishings to
text: chandeliers -- is covered in THICK CRYSTALLINE ICE, the
text: building having long-since been breached by weather. Snow
text: swirls in the air, drifting down through a hole in the roof.
text: Caesar lifts a hand to stop the others as he spots -- BOOT
text: PRINTS in the frost on the floor. The apes' eyes follow them
text: across the lobby's expanse... to where they disappear into
text: the black opening of AN ENORMOUS HEARTH along the wall.
text: The apes cautiously close in, guns trained on the hearth,
text: deep and dark enough to conceal whoever's hiding inside...
text: Caesar stops at the opening; he COCKS his gun LOUDLY,
text: levelling it -- Rocket and Luca COCK their weapons too...
text: ... when suddenly, the STOLEN SHOTGUN is tossed out at them,
text: landing at the apes' feet with a thud. They stare down at it
text: uneasily -- when to their surprise the STOLEN BINOCULARS come
text: skittering out too. And then the COMPASS.
text: The apes exchange a look -- Rocket quickly grabs the shotgun,
text: and the apes wait expectantly, weapons still raised, as --
text: THE FIGURE slowly begins to emerge from the darkness, head
text: hung remorsefully, still obscured in the hood of the worn-out
text: parka... He starts to raise his hands in surrender, and as
text: his head lifts... we discover --
text: HE IS AN APE.
text: A chimp with more skin than hair on his small, rounded head,
text: he has oversized ears and a little scruff of beard, his
text: scrawny frame swimming in the big green parka.
text: He stares up at our shocked trio with a sheepish, apologetic
text: smile... and finally, he SPEAKS ALOUD in halting grunts,
text: pointing a finger at his own chest --
speaker_heading: SCRAWNY CHIMP
dialog: (chastising himself)
dialog: Bad... ape... Bad ape...
text: Our three apes just gape back, no idea what to make of him...
text: Rocket lowers his gun. Then signs:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Who are you?]
text: But Bad Ape just tilts his head, not comprehending. Our apes
text: exchange uncertain looks. Then Luca turns to Bad Ape, leery:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [Where are you from?]
text: No answer. Luca turns to Caesar.
speaker_heading: LUCA (CONT'D)
dialog: [I don't think he understands.]
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: (to Caesar)
dialog: [I don't recognize him. He's not one of
dialog: us.]
text: Caesar regards the odd little chimp a moment; then SPEAKS:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Are you... alone here?
text: Bad Ape's eyes dart uneasily from face to face -- it's not
text: clear if he understands this either -- but then he looks back
dialog: at Caesar... and NODS.
text: A soft CREAKING across the lobby causes their heads to turn --
scene_heading: MAURICE AND THE GIRL
text: stand just inside the entrance, peering back uncertainly at
text: them across the giant space.
text: Bad Ape notices the Girl, SHIVERING BADLY beside Maurice. Bad
text: Ape considers her a moment, then lowers his hands --
text: Rocket lifts his weapon again, wary -- but Bad Ape just
text: continues, removing his parka; finally he holds it out in one
text: hand -- calls out to the Girl --
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: Cold...?
text: No one says anything. Bad Ape turns to Caesar. Holds out
text: the parka, gesturing to the Girl with a tentative smile:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: Cold.
text: Caesar stares hesitantly at Bad Ape and the ratty jacket.
text: Finally, he reaches out, accepts it from Bad Ape's fingers.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: AROUND THE HEARTH - A SHORT TIME LATER
text: as Bad Ape starts A FIRE.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Warming herself by the flames, the Girl -- now in Bad Ape's
text: parka -- sits with Caesar and the others, looking around in
text: wonder at SPRAWLING PILES OF BAD APE'S SCAVENGED TREASURES
text: beside the hearth, a hoarder's paradise of dry goods, canned
text: food, and an endless array of STOLEN ITEMS and TRINKETS.
text: Bad Ape beams as he stokes the flames for his new guests:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: I see girl. Think... you human. But
dialog: you... apes. Like me!
text: He smiles excitedly -- when he sees the Girl picking up a
text: trinket from a pile: a glinting CHEVY NOVA CAR EMBLEM. He
text: gently snatches it from her, kindly shakes his head no.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (peering around)
dialog: You... live here?
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: (nodding quickly)
dialog: Long time. Long, long time.
text: He suddenly scurries away; puzzled, Caesar watches him as he
text: rummages through what looks like a little sleeping area. He
text: returns with a small STUFFED CROCODILE, hands it to Caesar --
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: (a wistful look)
dialog: Home. Old home.
text: Confused, Caesar looks down at the stuffed crocodile, finds
text: embroidered on its belly: WORLD FAMOUS SIERRA ZOO.
text: Caesar peers up at him, trying to make sense of this... then:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Are there more like you? More apes?
dialog: From zoo?
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: Dead. All dead. Long time.
text: He looks at Caesar, growing solemn as he explains:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: Humans get sick... Apes get smart...
text: Caesar nods, understanding he means the Simian Flu --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: Then humans kill apes. But not me...
dialog: (grins, proud)
dialog: Not me. I run.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You learn to speak...?
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Listen to human...
text: His face abruptly contorts into an "angry human" expression --
text: he waves a chiding finger as he mimics:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: "Bad ape! Bad ape!"
text: Then, turning his head, he realizes the Girl has the shiny
text: Chevy Nova emblem again -- he reaches for it, possessive:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: (gently admonishes)
dialog: No... No touch.
text: She stares at it longingly as he sets it down. He looks back
text: at the apes, smiles -- then rushes away for something else...
text: The apes all watch their excitable host, perplexed -- Maurice
text: turns to Caesar, signs an aside:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Amazing... Always thought we were the
dialog: only ones. Wonder if there are others
dialog: out there somewhere? Others like us.]
text: Just as Caesar begins to contemplate the mind-blowing
text: thought, Bad Ape bounds back in, hurriedly passing out
text: packages of vacuum-foiled food rations (M.R.E.'s).
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: Here! Eat, eat!
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: New friends. Special day.
text: Bad Ape tears the top off one, starts eating the dehydrated
text: food, nodding encouragingly for them to do the same.
text: Caesar looks slowly down at the ration in his hand -- notices
text: an official military seal: "U.S. GOVERNMENT PROPERTY: CA
scene_heading: STATE BORDER QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER" CUT
text: TIGHTER on the word: BORDER. Caesar suddenly looks up:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Where did you get this?
text: Bad Ape turns to him, confused. Caesar holds up the package.
text: Bad Ape looks uneasy... his voice lowering to a hush:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: Bad place. Very bad. I find. Long time
dialog: ago. After zoo. Looking for food. Find
dialog: human zoo. Zoo for sick.
text: Engrossed, Caesar's eyes meet his... as Bad Ape continues:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
text: Big walls. Sick humans try climb. Bad
dialog: humans kill. Then get sick too. All
text: dead now. All dead.
text: Caesar and the others take this in, somehow haunted. Then:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Bad humans...? Soldiers?
text: Bad Ape recognizes the word, nods gravely:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: Soldiers.
text: The posse looks to each other with rising intensity...
speaker_heading: ROCKET
text: [An old, deserted military camp on the
dialog: border...?]
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [Maybe this is where the Colonel and the
dialog: troops from the north are going to meet?]
text: Caesar nods: maybe. He turns back to Bad Ape.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Is it far? Can you take us?
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: (looks agog)
dialog: Human zoo?! No... No go back there.
dialog: Everyone dead. I come here. Safe here.
dialog: Never go back!
text: Caesar reaches out his hand, places it on Bad Ape's shoulder:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Please. You must take us.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: No! Can not take! Can not take!
text: Scared, he pushes Caesar's hand from his shoulder, a little
text: too hard -- Rocket GRABS him, incensed Â­- but Caesar
text: restrains Rocket, shakes his head no. Bad Ape shrinks in
text: Rocket's grasp -- then sees something, and points desperately
text: to the little windows along the wall --
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look! More snow! Can not go, must stay
dialog: here.
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Look, look!
text: They all look to the massive lobby window to see it is indeed
text: snowing hard now.
text: Rocket finally releases Bad Ape. He exhales, looks at them
text: with renewed optimism.
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: You stay here. Eat. Rest.
dialog: (smiles hopefully)
dialog: With me.
text: Caesar considers, reluctantly nods to the others. Bad Ape is
text: relieved -- when he sees the Girl staring longingly again at
text: the Nova emblem; he grabs it, hands it to her ceremoniously:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. You keep.
text: He looks around, smiling at the apes for approval; the Girl
text: gazes happily at the emblem, as with a WHISTLING HOWL, we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HIGH OVER THE CAVERNOUS LOBBY - MIDDLE OF NIGHT
text: Snow whirling hard through the ice palace. HOLD; CUT TO:
scene_heading: NEAR THE HEARTH - SAME
text: The last embers of the fire dying out as everyone sleeps...
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON CAESAR
text: The only one still awake. He sits up, eyes settling on --
text: THE GIRL, curled into Maurice's belly, hugging her doll; the
text: Nova emblem is clutched in her little fingers. Maurice's arm
text: is draped protectively around her as they sleep.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Caesar stares at the sight, growing sad, his mind distant...
speaker_heading: BAD APE (O.S.)
dialog: Who is...?
text: Caesar turns, startled to find Bad Ape watching him; Bad Ape
text: nods toward the Girl.
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: Child.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: But she... with you?
text: Caesar nods.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: She has no one else.
text: Bad Ape gazes at the Girl, suddenly feeling sorry for her.
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: I see you look at her. Just now.
dialog: (turns back to Caesar)
dialog: Look sad.
text: But Caesar says nothing. Bad Ape studies him; then ventures:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: You... have child?
text: Caesar turns -- Bad Ape smiles sweetly, expectantly... but
text: Caesar just returns a withering look. Bad Ape falls silent.
text: Caesar looks away. Then, quietly, stoically:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I had two. But one was killed. By
dialog: human.
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: (quietly struck)
dialog: Oh... Soldier?
text: Caesar, still not looking at him, NODS. A silent beat, as
text: Bad Ape looks down, pensive. Then softly:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: I had child...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Caesar turns, surprised. Bad Ape stares at the ground,
text: remembering, a little lost. Then slowly, he looks up.
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: You think... you will find him... at
dialog: human zoo? Soldier?
text: Caesar's eyes drift to the dying embers.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I don't know... Maybe.
text: Bad Ape ponders this. Torn, he finally looks at Caesar:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: Then... maybe I take you.
text: Caesar turns from the fire, their eyes meeting as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF THE INN - MORNING
text: The Girl steps out alone onto the deserted porch, still
text: wearing Bad Ape's parka. As she clutches herself against the
text: cold, something catches her eye; she looks up overhead at the
text: PINK FLOWERS of a perennial dogwood tree, poking through the
text: snow -- the only color in an otherwise stark white world.
text: With the muffled crunch of hooves, Luca and Rocket appear,
text: guiding the four horses toward the porch.
text: Luca notices the Girl staring up at the branch of flowers.
text: He watches a moment, then moves toward her... and reaches his
text: long arm up, snapping off a small piece of the branch.
text: The Girl observes as Luca bends down, his massive gorilla
text: face right in front of hers as he very gently slips the
text: flowers behind her ear. She smiles. He blinks back at her
dialog: sweetly, when --
text: Caesar and Maurice emerge onto the porch. Luca quickly
text: straightens, resuming his tough guy demeanor.
text: Maurice lowers next to the Girl, and she hops on his back.
text: He moves to his horse, and climbs up with her. Caesar,
dialog: Rocket and Luca mount up as well, when --
text: -- the front door SQUEAKS open; they turn to see Bad Ape
text: stepping out to join them. He wears boots, an old wool
text: blanket on his shoulders, and a striped toque on his head.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Caesar and the others stare at him, deadpan, but he is
text: oblivious, looking from horse to horse, wondering where he's
dialog: supposed to go.
text: Luca GRUNTS gruffly, points him toward Rocket's horse. Bad
text: Ape smiles, and starts for Rocket's horse.
text: Rocket looks miserable as Bad Ape struggles to climb up.
scene_heading: EXT. SIERRA MOUNTAINS - DAY
text: The group silently weaves its way through snow-covered trees.
text: The Girl watches curiously as Caesar removes his canteen from
text: his saddle bag. Maurice notices her staring, follows her
text: gaze to see Caesar drinking. Maurice grunts softly to her.
text: She turns, and he gestures at Caesar, making the sign for:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Thirsty.]
dialog: (repeats for her, teaching)
dialog: [Thirsty.]
text: She just stares blankly at Maurice. He takes her small hand
text: in his, demonstrating the way to sign the word.
text: Caesar notices, lowering his canteen, quietly intrigued.
text: Maurice demonstrates again. But the Girl shows no interest
text: or understanding. Her eyes return to Caesar -- who for the
text: first time softens, offering a sympathetic gaze.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODED AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The group have left the trail, moving through dense forest.
text: Caesar watches Bad Ape who peers anxiously ahead... to where
text: SUNLIGHT spills in at the edge of the woods. Bad Ape turns
text: to meet Caesar's eyes, fearful:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: There...
text: Caesar looks at the light, then turns to the others, raising
text: his hand for them to stop.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EDGE OF THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATER
text: On foot now, the group presses in close behind the trees at
text: the forest's perimeter, squinting into the hard, low sun at --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: AN ENORMOUS CANYON BELOW THEM
text: Steep, snow-covered granite cliffs slope down in shelves,
text: disappearing into an unseen expanse below.
text: The TOP OF A MASSIVE, PRISON-STYLE WARDEN'S TOWER pokes
text: ominously up in the distance, from the center of the chasm.
text: Caesar raises the binoculars, PEERING AT THE TOWER: sun
text: flares off the cement and steel structure, stained with
text: corrosion. Through the windows, it appears to be DESERTED.
text: Caesar lowers the glasses, staring uncertainly -- when he
text: notices something about the FADED CALIFORNIA STATE FLAG
text: hanging from the tower -- he looks through the binoculars to
text: examine it: the flag is hung upside-down... and a HUGE "A"
text: has been painted in black across it.
text: Then Caesar suddenly notices movement down below -- he shifts
text: the glasses to find TINY SILHOUETTED FIGURES, just barely
text: visible along the edge of the lowest visible shelf.
text: Caesar turns, looks from face to face... then:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [Luca, let's take a closer look.]
dialog: (to Rocket)
dialog: [Stay here. Keep them safe.]
text: Rocket nods dutifully, and Caesar and Luca start off --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - SUNSET
text: The HEAVILY SILHOUETTED FIGURES in the distance are still
text: small, but from this closer vantage we can see now they're in
text: the midst of placing a series of about twelve MYSTERIOUS, X-
text: SHAPED STRUCTURES along the cliff's edge -- maybe this is
dialog: some kind of defensive perimeter...?
text: REVEAL CAESAR LOWERING HIS BINOCULARS; he looks confused as
text: he turns to Luca, lying beside him on the edge of a ridge.
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [What are they doing?]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Caesar turns back, looking through the binoculars again,
text: trying to decipher this strange activity -- when Luca GRUNTS
text: at him with quiet alarm. Caesar turns.
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: (points)
dialog: [What's that? A patrol?]
dialog: Caesar looks --
scene_heading: THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
text: finding a PAIR OF HORSES on a ledge right below.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (O.S.)
dialog: Don't see riders...
text: Suddenly AN OUT OF FOCUS SHAPE RISES directly in front of the
text: binoculars -- Caesar drops the glasses to discover --
text: AN ALPHA OMEGA SOLDIER looming right above him, rifle raised!
text: The soldier pulls the trigger -- CLICK -- but the gun is
text: jammed! Panicked, the soldier rears back, about to lunge
text: forward with the rifle's BAYONET -- when --
text: LUCA DIVES PROTECTIVELY in front of Caesar --
text: -- taking the bayonet blade in his gut as he YANKS the man
text: down, WRESTLING him to the ground! They roll violently,
text: finally coming to a stop, Luca atop the motionless soldier --
text: Caesar's eyes land on the BLOOD-STAINED BAYONET, lying in the
text: snow beside them -- he scrambles up, rushing to Luca --
text: -- when a SECOND SOLDIER steps out, startling Caesar -- about
dialog: to shoot -- when --
text: WHAM! THE SECOND SOLDIER CRUMPLES, revealing Rocket behind
text: him, having just clubbed him with the butt of a rifle.
text: Rocket looks to Caesar, signs regretfully, out of breath:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [I saw them from up there... Coming for
dialog: you...]
text: They both turn immediately to Luca... who is rolling
text: painfully off the dead man; he looks at them helplessly,
text: GASPING, clutching his gut... CUT TO:
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: BACK UP IN THE WOODS - DUSK
text: Waiting anxiously at the edge of the trees, Bad Ape, Maurice
dialog: and the Girl stare as --
text: ROCKET returns, climbing quickly up toward them, a grim
text: expression on his face, clutching the bayoneted rifle in his
text: hand... right behind him, CAESAR CARRIES LUCA across his
text: back, like a Vietnam soldier shouldering a fallen brother.
text: They all retreat into the safety of the woods, the group
text: converging around Caesar as he lowers Luca to the ground...
text: Emotion in his eyes, Caesar looks down at his loyal friend.
text: Fading fast, Luca smiles weakly. He manages to raise a hand,
text: holding it out to Caesar; Caesar grasps it firmly.
speaker_heading: LUCA
dialog: [At least this time... I was able to
dialog: protect you...]
text: Deeply affected, Caesar holds Luca's gaze a silent moment,
text: and then Luca releases his grasp, his hand drifting to the
text: ground as the rest of the group looks on. Her eyes fixed on
text: the massive gorilla, the Girl climbs off Maurice's back...
text: The others watch, surprised, as she approaches Luca, climbing
text: onto his chest. She stares down, her little face inches from
text: his... for the first time we see deep emotion in her eyes.
text: Luca peers up vulnerably as she removes the twig of flowers
text: he placed behind her ear... and gently tucks it behind his;
text: she begins to cry. Caesar is struck by her display of
text: emotion. Luca smiles at her, then gradually his smile fades
text: as his face grows still... and life ebbs from his eyes.
text: TIGHT ON CAESAR, staring intensely at Luca, a mixture of rage
text: and guilt in his eyes. The others watch him silently.
text: Finally, Maurice ventures a SOFT GRUNT to him. Caesar turns.
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [I know how much you have lost... But now
dialog: we have lost another.]
text: Caesar just stares, inscrutable.
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: [Please... it's not too late to leave
dialog: this place. To rejoin the others.]
text: Emotion stirring, Rocket cannot hold back --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Luca gave his life! We can not turn
dialog: back -- !]
dialog: Maurice remains fixed on Caesar --
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Caesar...]
text: But Caesar turns away. He shakes his head grimly; then
text: utters quietly, consumed:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: They must pay...
text: Everyone stares, until finally, Caesar turns back. His eyes
text: meet Maurice's, whose gaze now appears judgemental:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Now you sound like Koba.]
text: Caesar turns to his friend, suddenly seething; the look in
text: his eyes is chilling:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: ...Koba? You know nothing. My wife and
dialog: son were killed.
dialog: (gestures to Luca)
dialog: And now my friend.
dialog: (then, harder)
dialog: You call me Koba...?!
text: Caesar glares at him, an unprecedented rift between them.
text: Rocket remains still, taken aback... waiting... Then:
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: (trembling with rage)
dialog: I did not ask you to come. Any of you.
dialog: This is my fight. I will finish it
dialog: alone... Go now. Join the others.
text: Stunned, they watch as Caesar rises, and takes the bayoneted
text: rifle from Rocket's shoulder... then heads off, back toward
dialog: the canyon...
text: HOLD on the apes' harrowed expressions, watching him; CUT TO:
scene_heading: HELICOPTER SHOT HIGH AND WIDE OVER THE GRANITE CLIFFS - NIGHT
text: SWOOPING OVER Caesar's tiny figure as he scales down the
text: vast, snowy expanse in the moonlight; he DROPS down to a
dialog: lower shelf, and we CUT TO:
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CAESAR'S POV
text: BREATHING HARD (O.S.), MOVING toward the CLIFF'S EDGE -- the
text: massive guard tower reaches up from the canyon beyond it --
text: ON CAESAR, air steaming from his nose; he SLOWS, SEEING --
text: THE TWELVE MYSTERIOUS X-SHAPED STRUCTURES looming ahead --
text: As he approaches we can suddenly start to make out DARK FORMS
text: STRAPPED to them...? Caesar's expression moves from
text: confusion... to dawning horror as he realizes: the forms
text: appear to be APES. He picks up speed again, rushing toward
text: them, their backs to us -- it's unclear whether the forms are
dialog: dead or alive...
text: Finally reaching the line of crosses at the edge of the
text: cliff, he finds a GROUP OF APES, all semi-conscious,
text: struggling to breathe, bound to Xs by their hands and feet...
text: Reeling, Caesar whips his head from ape to ape, trying to
text: make sense of this -- when he HEARS A DREADFUL MURMUR RISING
text: from the canyon; heart racing, he spins, staggering toward
text: the edge to PEER DOWN --
scene_heading: INTO THE CANYON
text: at what looks like a ENORMOUS, FORMER PRISON CAMP at the base
text: of the sheer mountains, three stories below.
text: As Caesar is drawn inexorably to the very edge of the cliff,
text: OUTDOOR HOLDING PENS come slowly into view... INSIDE THE
text: PENS ARE HUNDREDS OF APES, MURMURING helplessly...
text: THE EXODUS HAS BEEN CAPTURED.
text: Caesar stumbles back from the edge, overwhelmed, in shock...
text: He turns in panic to the bound apes -- suddenly recognizing
text: SPEAR among them. He rushes to Spear's side.
text: Spear looks like he's near death, his head sagging. Caesar
text: lifts Spear's face in both hands -- Spear's eyes slowly open;
text: as they focus on Caesar, he can't believe what he's seeing.
text: Caesar yanks the bayonet off his rifle, quickly cuts Spear
text: down. Spear slumps to his knees -- Caesar crouches to steady
text: him as Spear struggles to sign, still stunned to see him.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SPEAR
dialog: [They came out of nowhere, attacked us...
dialog: We were sure they would kill us all --
dialog: but the Colonel stopped them!]
text: Caesar stares at him, surprised --
speaker_heading: SPEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: [There was madness in his eyes! He said
dialog: they would use us, before we died.]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Use you...?
speaker_heading: SPEAR
dialog: [They've been forcing us to work!]
text: Caesar turns to look below -- when Spear suddenly gives out,
text: collapsing. Caesar quickly turns -- seeing brutal LASH MARKS
text: across Spear's back. Horrified, Caesar lifts Spear up,
text: holding him in his arms.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What... kind of work...?
text: But Spear struggles for consciousness, his eyes fluttering
text: closed... He begins to collapse -- Caesar is stricken:
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait -- my little son -- is he here...?
text: But Spear just falls to the ground, Caesar watches aghast --
text: when an APE FOOT steps right beside him -- Caesar turns,
text: startled -- looks up to see --
text: RED standing ominously right above him! The BUTT OF RED'S
text: RIFLE comes SLAMMING DOWN into us -- and we SMASH TO --
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
text: HOLD for a long moment. Hear the echoing sound of WATER
text: SLOWLY DRIPPING. Then HARD CUT TO --
scene_heading: SUPER TIGHT ON CAESAR'S EYES
text: as they wince open, disoriented, in pain, his face pressed to
text: the ground... A SHAFT OF HARSH LIGHT blasts down from above.
text: Water drops splatter around him.
text: Caesar peers around, struggling to get his bearings, his POV
text: drifting in and out of focus: he finds TRACKS embedded in the
text: ground, a rusted-out TRAIN ENGINE in the shadows. The place
dialog: was a depot of some kind.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He glances up at the cavernous, curved ceiling; sodium vapor
text: security lamps shine in through a rip, which leaks melting
text: snow. And then he notices --
text: AN OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE LOOMING IN THE DARKNESS
text: a few feet away: it's PREACHER, tensely holding his crossbow,
text: looking unsettled as he stands guard... when an unseen VOICE
text: comes quietly from the shadows as WET FOOTSTEPS approach:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (O.S.)
dialog: Grant and Lee... Wellington and
dialog: Napoleon...
text: A SHAPE finally enters the light: it's THE COLONEL, who
dialog: studies Caesar inscrutably:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
text: Custer... and Sitting Bull.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You're probably not much of a reader.
dialog: But this is... this is a big moment.
dialog: This is... beyond... historic.
text: Caesar glares up at him, rage welling...
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Where were you...?
dialog: (then)
dialog: We came upon your herd... we got lucky.
dialog: But I was surprised. You weren't with
dialog: them.
text: They stare at each other an intense beat... Caesar crawls
text: menacingly toward him -- but is instantly YANKED BACK HARD.
text: GASPING, Caesar reaches for his throat to discover his wrists
text: are shackled and his neck is CHAINED by a NECK COLLAR...
text: Writhing, he turns to see RED cruelly gripping the end of the
text: chain. Preacher takes a step closer, levelling his crossbow
text: threateningly; Caesar's eyes lock with his. The Colonel
text: watches their stare-down:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope you don't come to regret sparing
dialog: his life. He's quite a good shot.
text: The Colonel just watches Caesar a beat; beneath the chilling
text: stillness of his eyes we sense something dangerous, damaged.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you finally come to save your apes?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (still in pain, seething)
dialog: I... didn't know they were here.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I came for you.
text: The Colonel searches Caesar's ferocious expression,
text: surprised, something dawning on him for the first time:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: I see... I kill somebody close to you
dialog: that night...?
text: Caesar looks him right in the eye, unblinking...
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: My... family.
text: The Colonel stares down, some mysterious nerve jolted inside
text: him. He comes closer, stands right above Caesar, looking at
text: him for a long beat, something about this revelation churning
text: in his mind; Red cautiously tightens his grip on the chain.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: I'm sorry. I was there to kill you.
text: Caesar just glares up at him, the Colonel so close... Struck,
text: the Colonel inches even closer:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: My God, look at your eyes... they're
dialog: almost human...
dialog: (a long beat; then)
dialog: How did you know I was here?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I was told you were coming... That
dialog: others would be joining you here.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: (a cryptic beat)
dialog: Joining me...?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: To finish us off... for good.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: Who told you that?
text: But Caesar won't answer. The Colonel just stares at him,
text: then turns to Red and NODS:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Ok, let's go.
dialog: Red quickly responds --
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Ok -- ok, Kerna...!
text: Red YANKS Caesar roughly to his feet; Caesar struggles,
text: CHOKING -- as Preacher moves in too -- and we HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON CAMP - YARD - TRACKING SHOT - NIGHT
text: MOVING with the Colonel, Red, and Preacher as they march
text: Caesar into the frozen, desolate yard; Caesar steals a glance
text: back at a CORRODED SIGN over the hangar: CA STATE BORDER
scene_heading: QUARANTINE DETENTION AND RELOCATION CENTER, PROCESSING DEPOT
text: As they walk along train tracks, Caesar turns forward, SEES
text: SOLDIERS huddled around fires in front of temporary barracks,
text: killing time -- they stare up at him menacingly -- up ahead --
text: A PAIR OF GUARD TOWERS LOOM
text: More HAND-PAINTED SLOGANS hang on signs, recalling the cult-
text: like vibe of the base camp. Armed GUARDS stare down as they
text: pass, straightening tensely at the sight of the Colonel --
speaker_heading: TOWER GUARD
dialog: Evening, Colonel!
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: (not even looking at him)
dialog: Any more trouble tonight?
speaker_heading: TOWER GUARD
dialog: (eager to please)
dialog: No, sir -- not anymore --
text: He gestures, and Caesar follows it to the LINE OF TWELVE APES
text: bound to the Xs on the granite shelf above. The Colonel
text: finally glances up at the Guard, eyes fixing critically --
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: You could use a haircut there, son.
dialog: (seeing the other guard)
dialog: You too, soldier.
scene_heading: BOTH TOWER GUARDS
dialog: Sir, yessir!
text: Red jerks Caesar's head back in line as they start to pass --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: HOLDING PENS ON EITHER SIDE OF THEM
text: Caesar looks into one of the pens... to see MASSES of CHAIN-
text: GANGED APES peering out mutely, shocked to see him. Caesar
text: stares back at them with tortured empathy -- when to his
text: surprise -- a change comes over their faces, and many begin
text: to avert their eyes... a sense they feel betrayed by him...
text: Stunned, Caesar marches on, devastated by the dawning
text: realization his apes have lost faith in him -- when PLAINTIVE
text: SHRIEKS suddenly seize his attention --
text: He quickly turns to the other pen... it is filled with APE
text: CHILDREN... they gaze helplessly at him -- when, suddenly,
text: one presses through to the fence, pushing his way past the
text: others, terrified as he tries to keep pace with Caesar;
text: Caesar is overcome by the sight of HIS SHRIEKING SON.
text: Caesar nervously glances at the Colonel, worried he'll
text: notice; he turns back to his son, shaking his head urgently,
dialog: trying to quiet him --
text: -- when the Colonel starts to turn... Seeing this, Caesar
text: has no choice -- he quickly turns away from his own child...
text: HOLD ON CORNELIUS, watching his father walk away --
text: THE DOOR TO THE ADULT APE PEN
text: swings open as the group arrives; Caesar peers in at the
dialog: hordes of prisoners --
text: The Colonel nods, and Red HURLS Caesar violently to the
text: ground, grabbing his leg HARD and shackling Caesar to the
dialog: others.
text: Red returns the key to Preacher -- Caesar staring up at the
text: Colonel, who watches an eerie moment longer, then heads off.
text: The others follow.
text: TIGHT ON CAESAR; he looks up at the ape prisoners... They all
text: stare at him coldly, and then turn their backs on him.
text: Caesar lifts his head, stunned... as ANOTHER GROUP turns
text: away... and ANOTHER. A quiet ape sound makes Caesar turn --
text: he finds LAKE in their midst, gazing back consolingly:
speaker_heading: LAKE
dialog: [Forgive them. We've been through much.]
text: Caesar nods, shell-shocked, reeling... Finally, he speaks,
dialog: quietly devastated:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I will find some way to get us out of
dialog: here. I promise...
speaker_heading: LAKE
dialog: (shakes her head, grim)
dialog: [You don't know what this place is like.]
text: The sound of crying makes Caesar turn; he looks at the pen
text: across the way, where little Cornelius is pressed to the
text: bars, helplessly reaching his arm out toward Caesar:
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS
dialog: [Father...!]
text: As Caesar gapes back, heartbroken, guilt-stricken, we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WIDE VISTA AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE - DAWN
text: We see the camp in the distance, nestled at the foot of the
text: mountains; a dilapidated barrier wall stretches out from the
text: front of it in both directions as far as the eye can see.
scene_heading: INT. ADULT APE PEN - MOVING SHOT - DAWN
text: TRAVELING OVER THE SLEEPING APES, chained on the icy
text: ground... we hear the sound of DISTANT MARCHING, when a LONE
text: HUMAN VOICE BEGINS SINGING out hauntingly across the yard in
text: a militaristic gospel tone:
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.)
dialog: Hu-uh-left... Left-right-left...
text: THE CAMERA ARRIVES AT CAESAR, who stirs, his eyes opening as
text: the SINGING CONTINUES. PUSH IN on Caesar, confused, as apes
text: around him start to wake up as well, a palpable anxiety
text: spreading... he looks at Ape Elder who shakes his head, grim.
text: Caesar turns at the building sound of at least THREE HUNDRED
text: SOLDIERS MARCHING in formation outside the APE PENS; he
text: rises, anxiously scans the rigid faces, intensity burning in
text: their eyes as they march past the frightened, caged apes.
text: As the SINGING STOPS, the soldiers abruptly halt, turning
text: about face, eyes fixed upward; Caesar follows the gazes to --
scene_heading: THE EMPTY WARDEN'S TOWER BALCONY
text: the "A" FLAG waving just below it. Chilled, Caesar watches
text: as the soldiers all hold in fervent SALUTE, and the X.O.
text: cries out, leading a MARINES-STYLE CALL-AND-RESPONSE:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CONT'D)
dialog: Blood...!
speaker_heading: SOLDIERS
text: MAKES THE GRASS GROW!!
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE OFFICER
dialog: We...!
speaker_heading: SOLDIERS
dialog: MAKE THE BLOOD FLOW!!
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE OFFICER
dialog: We are the beginning...!
speaker_heading: SOLDIERS
dialog: AND THE END!!
text: Caesar stares, unnerved, as the Soldiers' call-and-response
text: crescendos in OMINOUS CHANTS OF "OO-RAH!" as they gaze up at
text: the tower, where finally... THE COLONEL SLOWLY EMERGES; he's
text: shirtless, despite the cold, not fully dressed yet -- he
text: stares down at the assembled troops, casually shaving the
text: back of his head with a straight razor as chants ROAR below.
text: A shrill chorus of ARMY WHISTLES suddenly breaks out --
text: Caesar quickly turns to see the soldiers moving for the pens;
text: as the doors unlock, ARMED SOLDIERS enter and Red and the
text: TURNCOATS storm in, forcing the lines of chained apes to
text: their feet and into the yard with WHIPS -- it's terrifying.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE COLONEL
text: watching the brutality; he stops shaving a moment, calmly
text: pulls a FLASK from his hip, and takes a slow drink; then he
text: disappears into the tower again.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: MARCHING gravely with hordes of apes across the snowy yard...
text: ARMED SOLDIERS pace menacingly atop FUEL TANKER RAILCARS
text: along the side of the camp, keeping watch over the prisoners.
text: Caesar slows, suddenly struck by what's LOOMING up ahead --
scene_heading: THE EXTREMELY HIGH BARRIER WALL
text: that seals in the front of the camp; it's unlike anything
text: we've ever seen. Part of it is man-made, cracked slabs of
text: weathered concrete erected side by side years ago; but a vast
text: section, growing right out of the original wall, is ape-made.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Massive tree-trunks have been fastened in a primitive but
text: elaborate framework, into which huge stones are being set,
text: one by one. The apes have been rebuilding the crumbling wall.
text: As Caesar moves closer, his eyes are drawn to an old slab of
text: cement, still standing in the midst of the ape construction.
text: On it, "A" is painted in HUGE BLOOD RED GRAFFITI SCRAWL;
text: next to this drip the words: "HUMANITY'S LAST STAND".
text: Caesar stares at the words, chilled... as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE WALL - DAY
text: Caesar labors, just another slave in the sea of apes passing
text: brutally heavy boulders to be laid into the growing wall, as
text: Soldiers keep GUNS trained on them. Caesar squints out at
text: even more apes perched dangerously on the rock shelf above
text: the tanker cars, quarrying for the stones.
text: Beside him, Lake heaves another boulder; Caesar peers past
text: her at the apes around them; they look WEARY, GAUNT; on the
text: framework above, EXHAUSTED apes -- Ape Elder among them --
text: battle to lift boulders on ropes. Lake sees the anguish on
text: Caesar's face as he takes in the suffering, she signs:
speaker_heading: LAKE
dialog: [We haven't had food or water since we
dialog: got here...]
text: Stunned, anger fills his face; he glares up at the structure:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [Why do they need a wall...?]
text: Lake looks back at him, shaking her head: I don't know --
dialog: when Caesar sees --
text: THE COLONEL arriving at the work site; his Soldiers nervously
text: address him as his eyes roam the wall, surveying the progress
text: -- then fix on Caesar -- when suddenly a SOLDIER CRIES OUT:
speaker_heading: BOYLE (O.S.)
dialog: HEY! HEY!
text: The Colonel turns to the commotion -- Caesar turns too -- to
text: find Ape Elder struggling high up on the framework, dizzy
text: with fatigue, losing grip on his rope as Soldiers and
text: Turncoat Apes watch with alarm from below --
text: -- when he COLLAPSES, the rope ripping from his fingers --
text: the rock CRASHES into the framing, KNOCKING DOWN a big
text: section of the stone wall in a violent chain reaction!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Furious, Boyle spins to one of the Turncoats -- Red. Caesar
text: watches as he orders Red to punish Ape Elder; Red and the
text: other turncoats pull the feeble ape from the rubble and drag
text: him into the yard, in full sight of the Colonel, where Red
text: dutifully begins to WHIP the old ape...!
text: Startled, Caesar looks at the Colonel, who watches the
text: beating, unmoved -- then back to the helpless old chimp --
speaker_heading: ON CAESAR
text: as he steps slowly forward in horror, pained by the
text: excruciating sight -- the apes in his line follow, affected
text: too... Caesar pulls himself up onto one of the tree trunks
text: in the framework, stepping into a CLOSE UP, his rage starting
text: to boil... until finally, unable to bear it, he ERUPTS:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: LEAVE HIM!!!
text: Heads turn, everyone stopping dead in their tracks as
text: CAESAR'S BOOMING VOICE ECHOES across the yard... Even Red
text: goes still, turning with the others to SEE --
text: CAESAR UP ON THE FRAMEWORK
text: GLARING back defiantly; then, he turns slowly to the Colonel,
text: fury in his eyes, no concern for his own safety...
text: For a moment, the yard is suspended in TOTAL SILENCE as
text: Caesar and the Colonel lock eyes -- when, one by one, the
text: APES START TO CHANT...
text: Low and guttural at first... then RISING INTO A DEAFENING
text: CHORUS OF REBELLIOUS HOOTS AND SHRIEKS -- as they defiantly
text: DROP THE STONES AND TOOLS to the ground!
text: Surprised, Caesar turns... stunned by what he has started...
text: he peers around at the apes, to find them all gazing at him
text: in solidarity as they chant...
text: CLOSE ON APE ELDER still on his knees, clutching his wounds,
text: watching in awe as the protest reaches a fever pitch...
text: The Soldiers are at a loss as to how to restore order -- they
text: turn to the Colonel who just stares ominously at Caesar...
text: Eyes fearfully on the Colonel, a SOLDIER FRANTICALLY GESTURES
dialog: across the chaos to Red and the Turncoats: get him!
speaker_heading: CAESAR
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: turns as Turncoats and Soldiers approach (Preacher among
text: them); unafraid, Caesar steps down to meet them -- his chain
text: gang CHANTING protectively -- when the Turncoats GRAB Caesar!
text: The Soldiers anxiously hold the others in check with their
text: weapons -- as the roar of the crowd grows even LOUDER --
text: Caesar glares as Preacher nervously unclips his keys from his
text: belt, tosses them to Red, who unshackles him...
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
text: watches as Caesar is marched into the yard, and thrust onto
text: his knees beside Ape Elder. The Colonel considers Caesar;
text: then, eyes still on him, gestures calmly to the Turncoats --
text: The Turncoats tighten their grip on Caesar's arms -- and Red
text: suddenly WHIPS Caesar's back with a VICIOUS SNAP!
scene_heading: The APES' CHANTING SUDDENLY FALTERS as --
text: Caesar WINCES -- but he refuses to break eye-contact with the
text: Colonel, who stares back, a battle of wills...
text: The Colonel nods; and Red LASHES Caesar again!
text: Spirits broken, the apes go SILENT; beside Caesar, Ape Elder
text: drops his eyes.
text: Red looks to the Colonel, lowering his switch -- but the
text: Colonel's eyes remain fixed on Caesar's, the two leaders just
text: staring at each other, neither giving in...
text: And then the Colonel NODS to Red again. Surprised, Red
text: hesitates -- then, LASHES Caesar once more, the CRACK echoing
text: through the silent camp. The Colonel coldly nods again; even
text: Red is shaken by the Colonel's relentlessness. Red slowly
text: lifts his whip again -- and --
text: WHAP! Caesar finally DROPS HIS HEAD, broken by the pain.
text: GASPS ripple through the apes. The Colonel nods to the
text: Turncoats, who release Caesar; he crumples to the ground.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: ...Ok. Back to work.
text: The SOLDIERS YELL for the apes to get back to work; but the
text: apes just stare at Caesar, worried, as he lies on the ground.
text: Caesar finally lifts his head, his face now smeared in MUD;
text: he looks at the apes, then glowers back at the Colonel,
text: fiercely gritting his teeth:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Apes need food. Water.
text: The Colonel glances at the apes, then back at Caesar:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Please. Tell them to work.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (simmering)
dialog: Give them food and wat--
text: -- without warning the Colonel suddenly pulls his sidearm and
text: shoots Ape Elder dead right beside Caesar, then immediately
text: places the gun against Caesar's temple -- the speed and
text: efficiency of the action is utterly chilling.
text: Caesar gapes in shock as terror ripples through the apes.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: (an eerie calm)
dialog: Tell them.
text: Caesar stares silently at him, unflinching, trembling with
text: rage -- as the Colonel SLOWLY COUNTS DOWN:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Five... Four...
text: He tightens his finger on the trigger; but Caesar remains
text: stoic, willing to die...
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Three... Two...
text: And suddenly an APE by the wall quickly reaches out and picks
text: up one of the boulders, desperate to save Caesar's life --
text: It's LAKE. The Colonel pauses at the sight, gun still
text: raised... Caesar turns to see her, surprised...
text: And then ANOTHER APE picks up a boulder. Then another...
text: Caesar watches, distraught, as more and more apes pick up
text: stones and tools. The Colonel finally lowers his gun.
text: Caesar glares back at him bitterly.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (turns to Red)
dialog: String him up, donkey.
text: And the Colonel heads off; Preacher stares down at Caesar
text: with pity as Red moves in... CUT TO:
dialog: 62.
text: A HIGH-ANGLE BINOCULAR POV OF CAESAR BEING TIED TO AN X
text: The X has been erected atop a platform on the tracks in the
text: center of the yard, for all to see; Red binds him up as
text: Preacher stands guard... As the POV starts to drop, REVEAL --
scene_heading: MAURICE - HIDDEN ON A CLIFF'S EDGE
text: Lowering the binoculars, in utter shock; lying beside him are
text: Rocket and Bad Ape, eyes glued to his expression. Maurice
text: hands Rocket the binoculars to see for himself --
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: (warning them, fearful)
dialog: Bad place...
text: But the apes ignore him. He turns to the Girl on Maurice's
dialog: back, looking for anyone who'll listen:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bad, bad place.
text: She just stares at him, blank-faced.
text: Peering through the glasses, Rocket makes a low anguished
text: grunt. Bad Ape turns anxiously:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: What? What you see...?
scene_heading: THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
text: Rocket sees Caesar on the X, face covered in mud; the POV
text: WHIPS to the MASSES OF CHAINED APES at the wall.
text: ROCKET sets the glasses down, turns to Maurice, overwhelmed:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Must save them! But how?]
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Must think! What would Caesar do?]
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: Oh no!
text: They look over to see Bad Ape squinting into the binoculars --
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Why so small?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He lowers the glasses to look at them, appalled. They just
text: stare at him. Then Rocket reaches out and flips the
text: binoculars the right way around, hands them back. Bad Ape
text: looks at him, confused. He peers through again.
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: (finally seeing the crisis
dialog: below)
dialog: Ohhhh...
scene_heading: ON THE PLATFORM
text: Red finishes roughly binding Caesar, who looks haggard.
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Alright -- that's good.
text: Red turns. Preacher jerks his head: go. Red takes a last
text: menacing look at Caesar, then starts down the platform.
text: Preacher watches him go... then turns back to Caesar;
text: he hesitates... then lowers his voice, hurriedly confiding:
speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I owe you one, so let me set you
dialog: straight here, ok? I think he respects
dialog: you, he does... that's why you're still
dialog: alive. But believe me, he can do a lot
dialog: worse than this. I've seen it.
dialog: (haunted, almost a whisper)
dialog: You do not want to agitate the man.
dialog: Understand? So just...
text: He gestures with his hand: back off. Disturbed, Caesar holds
text: his gaze; then watches as Preacher descends the platform...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: BEHIND CAESAR HANGING LIMPLY ON THE X - NIGHT
text: We're looking out past Caesar over the camp, as exhausted
text: apes are herded away from the wall, the work day over... A
text: diesel GENERATOR COUGHS to life, HARSH LIGHTS blinking on.
text: Caesar squints into the glare, weary -- when the SOUND OF
text: SOLDIERS makes him look below -- at a group approaching from
text: the rear of the camp, rolling ominous-looking ARTILLERY;
text: suddenly concerned, he watches them head toward the apes...
text: ...the fraught apes look alarmed as they see the weapons and
text: Soldiers coming their way -- then Caesar discovers even more
text: Soldiers with MASSIVE MACHINE GUNS by the wall. Unnerved, he
text: sees them hoisting the guns up to the sentry towers... where
text: others position them on tripods; but then Caesar NOTICES --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: All the weapons are POINTED OUTWARD, BEYOND THE CAMP...
text: Caesar is relieved; he stares at the weapons, perplexed --
text: when he hears FOOTSTEPS; he turns to see --
text: RED climbing the platform toward him, gripping a long MACHETE
text: with a look of cruel satisfaction... Startled, Caesar
text: tenses; he peers around anxiously to FIND --
text: THE COLONEL eerily watching from the warden tower window...
text: Chilled, Caesar turns back, bracing for the worst, as Red
text: stops before him... He looks at the knife, then meets Red's
text: cold gaze. Steeling himself, he hardens, his voice hoarse:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What did the Colonel promise you? You
dialog: really think he will let you live...
dialog: after we are gone?
text: Red just stares, contempt in his eyes.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: No matter what you do... you'll never be
text: one of them.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You let them call you "donkey"...
dialog: You are ape.
text: Red raises his knife, examining it in his hands; he runs his
text: fingers along the edge... Then looks at Caesar, sneers:
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Koba right. You think you know better...
dialog: than rest of apes. But look you now.
dialog: (his expression darkens)
dialog: You nothing.
text: Red SUDDENLY LIFTS THE MACHETE -- Caesar's eyes widen as RED
text: SWINGS DOWN AT HIM VICIOUSLY -- THWAP!!! THE BLADE SINKS
text: INTO THE WOOD, AN INCH FROM CAESAR'S WRIST, HACKING THROUGH
text: THE ROPE -- ! Caesar turns to Red in shock, as his arm is
dialog: set free.
speaker_heading: RED (CONT'D)
dialog: (menacing, quiet)
dialog: Kerna... want see you.
text: Caesar looks back up at the tower window where the Colonel
text: remains staring a moment longer; then turns, and disappears.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
text: Then a DOOR IS OPENED, REVEALING -- we are --
scene_heading: INT. WARDEN'S TOWER - NIGHT
text: The Colonel stands with his back to us, leaning on a map-
text: covered table in the former window-lined control center,
text: smoke rises from sage and grass smudge burning in a tin bowl.
scene_heading: CAESAR, PREACHER AND RED ENTER
text: approaching the Colonel, who still doesn't acknowledge them;
text: as searchlights outside sweep through, Caesar catches a brief
text: glimpse of a room just off the control center -- it looks
text: almost like a sanctum; light passes over APE SKULLS... the
text: word "HISTORY" scrawled on a wall... then the room goes dark
text: again. Caesar looks unsettled -- his gaze returning to the
text: Colonel, and noticing for the first time painful looking
text: BRAND SCARS on the back of his hands: one Alpha, one Omega.
text: The Colonel finally speaks, eyes still on the map:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Interfere with the work again, and I'll
text: begin slaughtering the apes, one by one.
dialog: Understand? I need that wall.
text: He looks up coldly at Caesar, then nods at Preacher: that's
text: all -- they start to lead Caesar out, but he won't go yet --
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Apes... need food... water.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: (eyes on the map)
dialog: They'll get food and water when they
dialog: finish the work.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Give them food and water... or they will
dialog: not be able to finish.
text: The Colonel looks up, amused by Caesar's audacity.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: You know you're very emotional.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What makes you think you're in a position
dialog: to make demands?
text: Caesar doesn't reply. The Colonel turns back to the map --
text: Preacher nervously tugs again on Caesar's chain --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: C'mon --
text: But Caesar stands firm, eyes fixed on the Colonel:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: The soldiers who are coming here... are
dialog: not coming to join you, are they?
text: The Colonel slowly looks up, smiles, suddenly intrigued -- as
text: Red warily tightens his grip on Caesar's chain...
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: I saw men outside by the wall...
dialog: preparing for battle...
text: The Colonel studies him, surprised:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: I was told you were smart, but... that's
dialog: impressive.
text: He stares at Caesar a moment; then finally:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: No. They won't be joining me.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: They are against you?
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: They... fear me.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Why...?
text: The Colonel just looks at him, silent.
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Because you kill your own men?
text: Preacher tenses; The Colonel holds Caesar's gaze, stunned...
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: We found bodies.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Something wrong... with these men.
text: The Colonel shakes his head in awe:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Jesus Christ... you are impressive.
dialog: (then, almost enjoying this)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, you paint quite a picture. What
dialog: you must think of me.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I think... you have no mercy.
text: The Colonel goes still, a deep nerve struck. He DARKENS:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: You came here to kill me. Were you going
dialog: to show me mercy?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: I showed you mercy... when I spared your
dialog: men. I offered you peace. And you
dialog: killed my family.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: (low, with contempt)
dialog: Mercy. Do you have any idea what your
dialog: mercy would do to us?
text: Caesar stares warily, confused by the simmering rage he seems
dialog: to have provoked in the Colonel.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're much stronger than we are. And
dialog: you're smart as hell. No matter what you
dialog: say, you'd eventually replace us, that's
dialog: the law of Nature. The irony is, we
dialog: created you. We tried to defy Nature,
dialog: bend it to our will. And Nature's been
dialog: punishing us for our arrogance ever
dialog: since. Testing us. Even now.
text: Caesar searches the Colonel's ominous expression... Then:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Ten months ago, we sent out recon units
dialog: to look for your base. They found
dialog: nothing. My own son was a soldier with
text: one of the groups. One day he suddenly
dialog: stopped speaking. He became...
text: primitive. Like an animal. They
dialog: contacted me, said they thought he lost
dialog: his mind, that the war was too much for
text: him. But then the man caring for him
text: stopped speaking too. Their medic had a
dialog: theory, before he stopped speaking. That
dialog: the virus that almost wiped us out -- the
dialog: virus every human survivor still carries
dialog: Â­- had suddenly changed... Mutated.
dialog: (peers at Caesar)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: And if it spread, it would destroy
dialog: humanity for good this time. Not by
dialog: killing us... but by robbing us of the
dialog: things that make us human. Our speech,
dialog: our higher thinking... It would turn us
dialog: into beasts... not unlike what you all
dialog: used to be. You talk about mercy...?
dialog: What would you have done?
text: Caesar stares back, unnerved, challenged... he has no answer.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, it was a moment of clarity for me.
dialog: I realized I would have to sacrifice my
dialog: only son, so that humanity could be
dialog: saved. I held that gun in my hand, and I
dialog: pointed it at my only child.
text: (emotion in his eyes as he
dialog: remembers)
text: He looked at me with trust in his eyes,
text: all he had left in his primitive gaze.
dialog: And I pulled the trigger. It purified
dialog: me. It made my purpose clear.
text: His eyes finally return to Caesar's, who looks stunned.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I gave orders to kill the other infected,
dialog: all of them, and anyone who might've been
dialog: in direct contact, even if they showed no
dialog: symptoms. We burned their belongings,
dialog: anything that might spread contamination.
dialog: Some of the men questioned my judgment.
dialog: I was asking them to do what I had done:
dialog: to sacrifice their families... their
dialog: friends. They refused. So I had them
dialog: killed too.
dialog: (growing darker)
text: Others with children deserted into the
dialog: woods. One of those cowards fled to my
dialog: superiors up north. They sent officers
dialog: down to restrain me. They tried to
dialog: convince me this plague could be dealt
dialog: with medically, that up there they were
dialog: already looking for a cure. That's when
dialog: I realized: they had learned nothing from
dialog: our past.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (harrowed)
dialog: You killed them too...?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: What did I do, Preacher?
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: (a beat, quietly)
dialog: You severed their heads, sir.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Except for the one I spared, so he could
dialog: return to deliver a message: if they
dialog: wanted to relieve me of my command,
dialog: they'd have to meet me here, and do it
dialog: themselves.
text: Caesar stares, his eyes questioning what the Colonel means --
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This place used to be a weapons depot.
dialog: They turned it into a relocation camp
dialog: when the crisis was just beginning. But
text: the weapons are all still here, inside
dialog: that mountain.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: This is a holy war. All of human history
dialog: has led to this moment. And if we lose,
dialog: we'll be the last of our kind. It will
dialog: be a planet of apes. And we'll become
dialog: your cattle.
text: Caesar just stares, unsettled; they hold each other's eyes...
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at you. You think I'm sick, don't
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: How many... will be coming?
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Probably all of them. Don't get any
dialog: ideas -- only thing they fear more than
dialog: me is you apes. They never questioned my
dialog: methods when it came to you.
text: He moves closer, looking at Caesar's face, his tone quieter:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't mean to kill your son...
text: Caesar remains totally still as the Colonel studies him...
text: The Colonel's nearness is almost too much to bear...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (leaning in even closer)
dialog: But if his destiny was to inherit your
dialog: unholy kingdom... then I'm glad I did.
text: A sudden rage surges behind Caesar's eyes -- HE LUNGES -- !
text: The Colonel LEAPS BACKWARD -- Caesar's fingers GROPING FOR
text: HIS THROAT as he SCRAMBLES out of reach JUST IN TIME -- Red
scene_heading: SUDDENLY SEIZES CAESAR'S CHAIN -- WRENCHING CAESAR BACK HARD!
text: The Colonel HITS the floor, FLASK tumbling from his jacket --
text: Panicked, FURIOUSLY LEVELS HIS CROSSBOW -- SCREAMING --
speaker_heading: PREACHER
scene_heading: HEY -- HEY-HEY-HEY!!!
text: CAESAR SEETHES, raging in vain against the restraint --
text: In shock, the Colonel gathers himself, picks up the flask,
text: self-consciously pocketing it as he stands, backing away --
text: he touches the side of his neck to find Caesar nicked him.
text: He looks at the BLOOD on his fingers with a rush, smiling
text: breathlessly as Caesar strains, CHOKING in Red's grasp:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: So emotional!
text: The Colonel watches, smile fading as Caesar finally relents:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I can see how conflicted you are. You're
dialog: confused in your purpose. You're angry
dialog: at me because of something I did that was
dialog: an act of war. But you're taking this
dialog: all much too personally.
text: Preacher watches as The Colonel steps forward, venturing
text: closer to Caesar, seemingly unconcerned for his safety...
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: ...sir --
text: The Colonel holds up his hand to silence Preacher as he stops
text: right in front of Caesar again, eye to eye... Caesar burns,
text: tortured by the agonizing effort to restrain his rage...
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: What do you think my men would've done to
dialog: your apes... if you had killed me?
text: Caesar looks up at the Colonel. The Colonel holds Caesar's
text: angry stare as he starts slowly forward:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (6)
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Or is killing me more important...?
text: The Colonel lingers tauntingly... finally, he turns to
dialog: Preacher -- and as Preacher and Red move in, we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: PREACHER AND RED MARCHING CAESAR OUT OF THE DEPOT - NIGHT
text: They head for the yard -- Preacher utters quietly, shaken:
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Didn't I tell you not to agitate him?
dialog: That was not smart, man...
text: Caesar glances at Preacher, then at Red behind them; he turns
text: forward, speaks softly to Preacher, a hint of sympathy:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: If this battle is coming... you should
dialog: leave, while you still can.
text: Preacher turns to him; then abruptly stops:
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Leave? What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: You are not like him.
text: Preacher looks at Caesar, taken aback -- maybe even offended:
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: He was right, you do think he's sick,
dialog: don't you? You're just like them. He's
dialog: not crazy. The world's gone crazy. And
dialog: he's the only one with the vision to get
dialog: us through this. The Colonel's a great
dialog: man. He sacrificed everything for us.
dialog: You can't judge him. Who are you to
dialog: judge him?
dialog: (darkening)
dialog: I was trying to give you a heads up, keep
dialog: you out of his way, I don't even know
dialog: why. But if you think you and I have
dialog: some kind of relationship -- that you're
dialog: gonna give me, what, advice? You can
dialog: disavow yourself of that notion right
dialog: fucking now.
text: Caesar is stunned. Preacher raises his crossbow:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon, kong.

scene_heading: ON THE CLIFFS JUST ABOVE THE CAMP - NIGHT
text: Concealed behind boulders, Rocket LOWERING THE BINOCULARS,

speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (worried)
dialog: [How is he?]
text: Rocket shakes his head: not good. He rises, waves for them

scene_heading: EXT. YARD - NEAR THE PENS - NIGHT
text: Caesar waits grimly at the base of the platform, as Red
text: unshackles his hands; Preacher stands guard, the X looming.
text: Caesar looks up to discover APES gathered at the bars of
text: their pen, unseen by Red and Preacher, whose backs are to
text: them. Their starved faces are etched with worry for Caesar.
text: He softens, eyes settling on Lake's gentle gaze as Red
text: continues to unshackle him. Concern fills Lake's eyes:
speaker_heading: LAKE
dialog: [You look weary.]
text: Caesar looks back at her, then peers out at the MASS OF
text: DISPIRITED APE FACES. Determination sets in; he steals a
text: look at his captors, then signs discreetly to the apes:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [Do not lose hope... Some way, somehow,
dialog: we will finish the journey to our new
dialog: home. I will find a way to get us out of
dialog: here.]
text: The Apes return moved stares -- when Red hands Preacher back
text: the key, and Preacher nods for Caesar to climb the platform.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Lake and the others watch as Caesar, weakened, takes an
text: exhausted step -- and suddenly STUMBLES, knocking into
text: Preacher -- who shoves him back, startled --
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Get off!
text: The Apes look scared for Caesar as Red yanks him down.
text: Recovering, Caesar lifts his head, glancing meaningfully back
text: at Lake, then rises to his feet...
text: Confused, Lake watches as Caesar continues up the steps --
text: when she notices CAESAR'S HAND slipping behind his back -- as
text: the hand subtly opens, Lake suddenly SEES Caesar is carefully
dialog: showing her something --
text: Preacher's shackle key is now concealed in Caesar's palm, its
text: small key ring looped slyly around his middle finger.
text: Lake can't believe her eyes; with dawning hope she turns,
text: points it out to the others -- their eyes widen, excitement
text: spreading as they watch him ascend the platform...
scene_heading: EXT. SNOWY CANYON FLOOR OUTSIDE THE PRISON WALL - LATE NIGHT
text: Rocket leads as the group sneaks along the base of the wall.
text: They arrive at a spot where the wall has come down, steal a
text: look around the edge, peering into the camp...
text: ...to see the apes in their pens, Caesar on the X, and
dialog: between here and there, SOLDIERS on duty --

speaker_heading: ROCKET

dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: On pins and needles, Bad Ape watches them raptly, trying to
text: interpret their sign language; he sees the repeated two-
text: finger-pointing sign for "get in", and the implication
text: worries him -- he anxiously taps Maurice on the shoulder --
text: As Maurice turns, Bad Ape tentatively MIMICS THE "GET IN"
text: SIGN, pointing with his two fingers at the camp:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: "In"...? "In"?
text: Maurice NODS. Bad Ape is immediately alarmed:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: No -- no go in -- !
text: But they ignore him -- Bad Ape persists with panic, shrinking
text: away from them as he pleads:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: Friends! Friends! No go in -- no go
dialog: iiii--
text: Without warning he ABRUPTLY DROPS STRAIGHT OUT OF SIGHT,
text: disappearing into the ground as it gives way underneath him!
text: Everyone turns, shocked to see him gone. They scramble to

text: his fingertips on the lip of a VERY DEEP HOLE!

speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: (overcome with gratitude)
dialog: Thank you, friend -- thank you --

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: REVEAL Caesar rousing from sleep; he looks frail, almost
text: faint -- his treatment and starvation taking its toll. He

text: He watches as the FIGURE OF THE COLONEL appears at the Warden
text: Tower window; The Colonel looks down at a SOLDIER awaiting
text: his command. The Colonel nods; the Soldier SIGNALS and --
text: TROOPS step forward with WHEELBARROWS and HEAVY PAILS.
text: Caesar watches confused as the troops spread among the apes,
text: scooping out HORSE-FEED and setting down PAILS of WATER.
text: The apes glance at each other, unsure... when one of them
dialog: nervously HOLDS OUT HIS HANDS --
text: A Soldier dumps a mound of the dry grain into his palms, and
text: the starving ape immediately SCARFS IT DOWN.
text: The other starving apes instantly rush forward with CUPPED
text: HANDS -- as others begin to lift pails, DRINKING THIRSTILY.
text: AT THE PENS, Lake watches amazed.
text: She looks up AT US, growing emotional, filled with gratitude:
speaker_heading: LAKE
dialog: [You saved our lives...]
scene_heading: REVERSE ON CAESAR
text: Stunned. He turns to see Red ascending the platform with a
text: pail of water. Red pauses before Caesar, turning to The
text: Colonel, who watches, motionless. Red turns back, raising

text: Caesar stares at him mistrustfully, but his ravaged body
text: craves sustenance... Finally he parts his lips --
text: But Red just POURS THE WATER OUT in front of his face,
text: DUMPING IT onto the platform.

text: But she continues, climbing out the top... Bad Ape clutches
text: his head, torn about what to do; then reluctantly starts up --
text: AT THE TOP OF THE HOLE
text: Bad Ape pokes his head up... to find the Girl heading away --
speaker_heading: ON THE GIRL
text: as she heads toward the edge of the rocks, drawn by something
text: she sees in the distance --
speaker_heading: BAD APE (O.S.)
dialog: No, no! Where you go?!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He appears, running after her.. He finds her SQUINTING out at
text: something past the rocks... He follows her stare to ONE OF
text: THE OPENINGS in the massive wall. He whispers to her:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: What? What you see...?
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - DAY
text: Maurice and Rocket head down the tunnel --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Must be under the camp by now!]
text: They stop in a cavernous concrete hub where the sewage
dialog: tunnels converge --
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [Wonder how close we are... to where
dialog: soldiers keep apes?]
text: He lifts his flashlight to the ceiling; they both look up --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A LOW ANGLE SHOT ALONG THE PRISON TRAIN TRACKS - DAY
text: Apes work on the wall in the distance, some HOISTING heavy BM-
text: 12 ROCKET LAUNCHERS into place above -- when -- we HEAR a
text: QUIET RUSTLING sound -- which continues as we PULL FOCUS to
text: the train rail in front of us, and begin PUSHING TOWARD IT...
text: As we clear over the rail, we TIP DOWN to see the BALLAST
text: GRAVEL under the tracks STARTING TO MOVE... The stones
text: SHUDDER, and suddenly begin to FUNNEL DOWNWARD as we CUT TO --
scene_heading: THE TUNNEL BELOW
text: where a RUSH OF GRAVEL showers over Rocket, who stands on
text: Maurice's back as Rocket claws through the earth above them.
text: DAYLIGHT suddenly peeks in through a TINY HOLE in the
text: surface. Rocket stops digging; he glances down at Maurice,
text: then carefully presses his eye to the hole...
text: ROCKET'S POV UP THROUGH HOLE
text: Peering up through the train tracks we can see A TALL METAL
text: POLE looming against the winter sky. As we --
dialog: 78.
text: CUT WIDE TO THE CAMP ABOVE
text: The pole is revealed to be a TRAIN SIGNAL SWITCH rising in an
text: exposed area of the yard, Soldiers nearby on either side.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CAESAR - SEEN THROUGH BINOCULARS - DUSK
text: He is covered in frost and ice, shivering with hypothermia,

speaker_heading: BAD APE (O.S.)
dialog: (quietly distraught)
dialog: Ohhhh no, friend...
scene_heading: REVEAL BAD APE - STILL AT THE EDGE OF THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING
text: lowering the binoculars -- he turns to the girl to share the
dialog: bad news --
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: He --
text: when he sees
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
text: already starting to walk away toward the camp!
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: (urgent whisper)
dialog: No!
text: He creeps out from behind the rocks after her -- FRANTICALLY
speaker_heading: WHISPERING:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: No no no... no no no...
text: She pauses, peering up for a moment at the immense wall.
text: Then she looks back over her shoulder at Bad Ape -- he WAVES
text: FOR HER TO COME BACK, NODDING desperately...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CAESAR ON THE X - NIGHT
text: His head bowed, fading even more now, shaking, his lips
text: cracked, his skin frostbitten and turning blue. He looks as
text: if he might die any second... It is eerily quiet now.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A SHADOW passes over him... And then, a PAIR OF APE HANDS
text: reach slowly into frame, gently cradling Caesar's face...
text: CAESAR'S EYES FLUTTER OPEN, struggling to see; he looks up at
text: the Ape, its face OUT OF FOCUS, haloed by the camp's lights.
text: As the Ape's head nears, blocking the light, its face comes
text: into view: it is KOBA, staring down at Caesar tenderly.
text: Caesar's eyes widen, bewildered; he's breathless:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Koba...
text: Koba leans in toward Caesar, gazing into his eyes... then
text: moves even closer, pressing his lips to Caesar's ear:
speaker_heading: KOBA
dialog: (a comforting whisper)
dialog: Sleep...
text: Fighting exhaustion, Caesar pulls back, struggling to resist.
speaker_heading: KOBA (CONT'D)
dialog: Let go...
dialog: (glances toward the apes)
dialog: You cannot save them... They will all
dialog: die here...
text: Caesar follows his gaze, then looks back at Koba, stricken:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: KOBA (O.S.)
dialog: Yes... Join me...
text: Caesar starts to shut his eyes, devastated -- when a BLINDING
text: FLASH startles him -- he squints back up as a MACHETE swings
text: through the air overhead -- the blade HACKS into the rope
text: binding his wrist with a LOUD THWACK!
text: Completely disoriented, Caesar looks back at the Ape beside
text: him again, realizing now it is RED. He looks past him to see
text: The Colonel and Preacher too -- as Red cuts the rope around
text: his other hand, Caesar finally COLLAPSES.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: If he's still alive in the morning, he
dialog: goes back to work or you shoot him.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Keep him separate from the others.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Preacher nods; as Caesar sees Red moving for him, he uses his
text: last bit of strength to close his fist around the key...
scene_heading: EXT. ROCK-OUTCROPPING - TOP OF THE HOLE - NIGHT
text: Rocket and Maurice clamber urgently out behind Bad Ape, who
text: stops at the edge of the rocks -- pointing frantically with
text: two fingers again and again at the opening in the barrier
dialog: wall -- trying to sign:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: IN! She go IN!
text: Stunned, Maurice and Rocket slowly turn to the camp; and we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: HIGH ANGLE OVER THE WALL
text: As Soldiers work busily in the towers and all along the wall
text: securing artillery -- we see the Girl walking right through
text: the open front gate directly below, totally unnoticed...
scene_heading: EXT. CAESAR'S SMALL CAGE - UNDER A GUARD TOWER - NIGHT
text: PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Caesar through the bars...
text: He lies on his stomach, face to the ground. As the CAMERA
text: stops, a small blurry FORM steps to the edge of frame...
scene_heading: REVEAL THE GIRL
text: Standing in front of the cage, staring down at Caesar sadly.
text: After a moment, she fishes into the pocket of her bulky
text: parka, and pulls out her RAG DOLL. She stretches her arm
text: through the bars, straining toward Caesar... GENTLY TOSSING
text: the doll toward him.
text: Dazed, Caesar slowly lifts his head, confused... and
text: discovers the doll next to him on the ground.
text: He looks up... to see the Girl staring down with concern.
text: She holds his gaze; then lifts her tiny hand and tentatively
text: slides her finger along her neck -- the sign Maurice was
dialog: trying to teach her for:
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: [Thirsty...?]
text: Caesar looks at her, stunned. And touched. And then --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Girl abruptly turns and walks off. Caesar cranes his
text: head, worried for her... unable to see where she's gone...
text: when she suddenly returns, lugging a pail of water in both
text: hands. She raises the pail, holds it to the bars.
text: Caesar lifts himself, pressing his face to the bars... and
text: she tilts the pail, gently spilling water into his mouth. As
text: Caesar thirstily guzzles, the Girl removes one hand from the
text: pail, touching the side of his face --
text: QUIET APE GRUNTS echo from the yard. The Girl turns to see --
text: A LARGE GROUP OF APES pressed to the bars of their pen,
text: watching her and Caesar. A few silently wave her over...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: AN EXTREME WIDE SHOT OF THE YARD
text: As the Girl crosses from Caesar's cage to the Apes' pen,
text: oblivious to the potential danger around her... REVEAL:
scene_heading: MAURICE, ROCKET, AND BAD APE
text: watching anxiously, their three faces huddled together in the
text: shadows, peering around the edge of the giant front gate...
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: gazing nervously through the bars at the Girl, who stands at
text: the Apes' pen, her back to us; she seems engaged in some
text: transaction with them, the Apes all trying to get near her --
text: Caesar's eyes dart tensely around at GUARDS ON PATROL in the
text: distance, unaware of her presence, but for how long...?
text: Finally, the Girl turns and heads toward Caesar, CRADLING
text: SOMETHING IN HER ARMS. Caesar watches curiously as she steps
text: up to his cage. He glances at the APES IN THEIR PEN to find
text: them all watching expectantly...
text: Caesar turns back to the Girl; she leans forward carefully,
text: as if about to spill the contents from her arms -- puzzled,
text: Caesar reaches his hands out to catch whatever it is --
text: AND A LONG STREAM OF GRAIN RUSHES INTO HIS PALMS.
text: Surprised, Caesar looks up at her... then out at the Apes in
text: the pen, their eyes all still on him. One of them raises his
text: hands, quietly pressing his fists together, SIGNING proudly:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: APE
dialog: [Apes together strong.]
text: A wave of emotion floods Caesar's face; and then he sees
text: other Apes silently raising their fists too... Caesar is
text: completely overcome as each and every one of them joins in.
text: A smile slowly surfaces on Caesar's face; you can almost see
dialog: his strength returning...
text: The Girl follows Caesar's gaze to the Apes and their up-
text: stretched hands; then turns back to Caesar. She uncertainly
text: raises her fists together too... smiling, proud of herself.
scene_heading: MAURICE, ROCKET, AND BAD APE
text: watch from behind the gate, affected by the sight -- when
text: they spot something the apes and the Girl cannot yet see --
text: THE COLONEL AND SOME OF THE OFFICERS IN THE DISTANCE
text: deep in conference, walking in the direction of the pens...!
text: MAURICE AND ROCKET exchange terrified looks --
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [If humans see her, they will kill
dialog: her...]
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ON CAESAR AND THE GIRL
text: as they SPIN, startled -- suddenly seeing the Colonel and
text: troops stepping into view ten feet away -- when -- a sudden
text: COMMOTION in the distance grabs their attention --
text: Caesar grunts urgently to the Girl, nodding for her to hide --
text: she presses quickly behind one of the guard tower legs --
text: just as the Colonel and troops stop in the path right before
text: Caesar's cage, still gazing off at the disturbance...
dialog: Caesar follows their looks to SEE --
text: A SQUAD OF FIVE SOLDIERS, guns-drawn, amped up, shouting at
text: AN UNSEEN INTRUDER... As they approach, prodding with their
text: weapons, Caesar discovers the intruder is --
text: ROCKET. He marches slowly, chin-raised defiantly.
text: Caesar watches in shock as Rocket is brought toward the
text: waiting Colonel... who slowly turns and looks suspiciously at
text: Caesar -- unaware of the Girl just behind the tower leg...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: As Rocket arrives at gunpoint, the Colonel gestures to Red.
text: Red and Rocket exchange hard stares; Red moves to restrain
text: Rocket's arms -- but ROCKET SUDDENLY RESISTS, thrashing into
text: Red, HEAD-BUTTING HIM -- Red stumbles, clutching his head,
text: stunned... then LAUNCHES furiously back at Rocket!
text: The two apes begin VICIOUSLY WRESTLING as the SOLDIERS WATCH,
text: guns trained; a few LAUGH derisively, amused by the display --
text: TWO TURNCOATS nervously approach, unsure what to do --
text: Caesar seizes this momentary distraction -- gestures for the
text: Girl to make a run for it -- SHE DARTS AWAY -- ducking behind
text: the long barracks nearby, streaking toward the wall --
text: The Colonel peers down annoyed at Red and Rocket; he calmly
text: pulls out his sidearm, points down at them and FIRES -- !
text: Caesar's head whips around -- as Rocket and Red FREEZE,
text: startled -- a CLOUD OF DIRT kicking up from where the bullet
text: hit the ground beside them...
text: Red immediately takes the opportunity to get the upper hand,
text: forcing Rocket's face to the ground, pinning him. The
text: Colonel walks closer to Rocket; stares at him a beat...
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: How many are out there? Are there
dialog: others?
text: Rocket stays silent, refusing to show even a hint of fear.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Soldiers)
dialog: Sweep the area.
dialog: (turns to Red)
text: Put him in the pen.
text: As the Colonel walks off, Red abruptly leaps to his feet,
text: grabbing Rocket by the ankle -- Rocket FLAILS VIOLENTLY as
text: Red drags him across the dirt and ice...
text: Caesar watches in horror as the turncoats move in, BEATING
text: ROCKET into submission as they HURL him into the pen. One
text: roughly SHACKLES HIM -- as Red delivers a last, VICIOUS KICK,
text: leaving Rocket in a crumpled heap as they exit.
text: Caesar's stricken eyes remain fixed on Rocket as he struggles
text: to his feet. His face bloodied and bruised, Rocket looks
text: back at Caesar through the bars of their pens -- and to
text: Caesar's surprise, Rocket smiles at him... He SIGNS:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Feeling better?]
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Thrown, Caesar looks at him, then manages a slight smile; he
text: nods. Rocket nods back, pleased:
speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
dialog: [Good. Then we can talk about escape.]
text: He brings his fists together: "Apes together strong."
text: Emotional, Caesar smiles, proud of his friend; as he brings
dialog: his own fists together...
text: PRE-LAP -- A LONE HUMAN VOICE SINGING OUT in gospel tones:
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.)
dialog: Hu-uh-left... Left-right-left...
text: AS WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. EPIC WIDE SHOT ABOVE PRISON CAMP - YARD - MORNING
text: The SOLDIERS MARCH in formation toward the Warden's Tower...
text: as the Apes peer anxiously through the bars of their pens...
text: The procession comes to a halt, all eyes lifting expectantly
text: to the Colonel's balcony, waiting for him to appear... when
text: the SOUND OF A METAL DOOR suddenly scrapes open -- everyone
text: turns, surprised to see --
text: THE COLONEL emerging at the base of the tower, right before
text: them. He's in FORMAL DRESS GREENS, MEDALS on his chest,
text: BERET on his head. He moves to the top of the steps, looks
text: out, studying their uncertain faces a pregnant moment...
text: ON CAESAR, observing from his cage -- his eyes flit warily to
text: Rocket's across the way -- then back to the Colonel... as he
text: finally begins to address his assembled troops; there is
text: something momentous, almost reflective in his tone:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: For two years we've fought relentlessly
dialog: against these beasts, and when we are
dialog: done with them, we will bring an end to
dialog: their kind. But now we find ourselves on
dialog: the eve of battle... against our own
dialog: kind. So you may ask: who is the real
dialog: enemy, who are we fighting here? And
dialog: I'll tell you. It's not the apes. It's
dialog: not the men who are on their way here
dialog: right now to altercate with us. The
dialog: battle we've been waging all this time is
dialog: against ourselves.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He watches them as the words sink in, then starts down the
text: steps, walking among them as he continues -- his eyes dart
text: momentarily across the yard, meeting Caesar's:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: They say we are inhumane. Indecent.
dialog: They call us a death squad. But they'll
dialog: never understand the extent of our
dialog: sacrifice. How agonizing it has been to
dialog: do what must be done, even as it tears at
dialog: our very souls. Because there are times
dialog: when you must abandon your humanity in
dialog: the fight to save humanity. All of you
dialog: have shown the courage to do that... But
dialog: now we must take that fight to them, or
dialog: this hellish trial will all have been in
dialog: vain.
text: (beat, still walking through
dialog: the ranks)
dialog: We can not fail. We're the last defense.
dialog: Somewhere in this world there are more
dialog: survivors. And whether they know it or
dialog: not, they are counting on us. To show
dialog: the will to protect them against this new
dialog: plague. We've seen it here. And it's
dialog: already spreading up north. If we lose
dialog: this battle, there'll be nothing to stop
dialog: it from spreading everywhere. If we
dialog: lose, in a matter of months, the human
dialog: race will gasp its last words, and go
text: silent. Just another dumb animal, left
dialog: to roam a godforsaken world.
text: He comes to a stop in the Soldier's midst -- Preacher close
text: by, gazing intently -- the Colonel's tone growing intimate:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Most of you are still young men and
dialog: women. And if we win, years from now,
dialog: you may be sitting somewhere with your
dialog: children, your grandchildren... and
dialog: they'll ask you: what did you do in the
dialog: greatest war...? And you can tell them,
dialog: you fought... viciously... for a gentler
dialog: world.
text: Preacher looks almost emotional -- the others too -- as the
text: Colonel NODS to the X.O. -- and as WHISTLES SHRIEK -- we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: THE APE PENS - MOMENTS LATER
text: CRANE over the apes being forced out into the yard...
text: FINDING the Colonel now wading through the chaos, Preacher
text: and Red at his side... as they ARRIVE at CAESAR'S CAGE.
text: The Colonel pulls out his sidearm, nods to Preacher who
text: unlocks the cage, opens the door... they all stare in at --
text: CAESAR, who returns a hard, weary look, making no motion to
text: exit -- when CH-CHINK -- the Colonel cocks his gun.
text: Caesar hesitates, then gathers the strength to stand, and
text: slowly steps out of the cage. The Colonel stares at him,
dialog: hard:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Send him up to the quarry. Alone.
text: Red fastens shackles to Caesar's ankles and wrists, and looks
text: at Preacher, who is searching through his key rings -- he
text: can't find the shackle key; suddenly nervous, his eyes dart
text: to the Colonel, as he continues searching in vain...
text: Impatient, the Colonel calls out to Boyle who's passing by
text: with the first groups of chained apes --
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Boyle! His cuffs.
text: Boyle heads over, starts to lock Caesar up -- when the
text: Colonel suddenly sees something... Caesar watches as the
text: Colonel steps toward the cage, reaches in... and retrieves...
text: THE GIRL'S DOLL. He stares at it, perplexed:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (turning to Caesar)
dialog: What is this...?
text: But Caesar is silent. The Colonel turns to Preacher --
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: How did this get in there?
text: Preacher shakes his head, looking pale:
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: I really don't know, sir...
text: The Colonel looks back hard at Caesar; then, finally:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Get him to work.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Colonel's stare lingers on Caesar as Red shoves him
text: forward; then the Colonel returns his attention to --
text: THE RAG DOLL IN HIS HANDS... looking eerily up at him...
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON CAMP - HIGH UP ON THE ROCK QUARRY SHELF - DAY
text: Caesar labors alone on a dangerously narrow perch, quarrying
text: for heavy stones high above the yard... He looks down as he
text: works, secretly scanning the yard, to FIND --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
text: waiting to be brought out of the pen, chained to a group of
text: other apes; he glances surreptitiously up at Caesar -- Rocket
text: NODS -- as Rocket's group is ordered out --
text: CAESAR WATCHES for a moment as Rocket's group heads toward
text: the wall -- then he turns quickly to FIND --
speaker_heading: LAKE
text: also looking up at Caesar, waiting with her group by the
text: CHILDREN'S PEN, picking up tools -- she NODS -- and suddenly
text: her group moves out toward the wall too --
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: turns quickly back to Rocket, whose eyes are fixed on his own
text: feet, COUNTING EACH STEP as his group approaches...
text: ...THE TRAIN SIGNAL SWITCH in the middle of the yard -- the
text: spot where he and Maurice dug up from the tunnel below... As
text: he passes it, Rocket looks up at Caesar -- stealthily signs:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [37.]
text: Caesar NODS. Then quickly turns back to Lake -- as she too
text: passes the train switch -- she looks up from her feet --
dialog: signs to Caesar:
speaker_heading: LAKE
dialog: [55.]
text: Caesar NODS -- and immediately begins to climb, pulling
text: himself up to a ledge above -- when -- PING!-PING! -- BULLETS
text: kick off the stones around him! He freezes, looks down at --
text: SOLDIERS standing guard ATOP THE FUEL TANKER RAILCARS -- one
text: of them lowers his rifle, yells out to Caesar --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: TANKER GUARD
dialog: That's high enough, kong!
text: Caesar submissively holds up his hands. The soldiers eye him
text: a beat longer as Caesar returns to quarrying... then, coast
text: clear, Caesar peers out at --
text: The ROCK OUTCROPPING in the distance, outside the camp; he
text: can just make out a DARK FORM behind the boulders -- CUT TO:
text: HANDHELD BINOCULAR POV OF CAESAR ON THE QUARRY LEDGE
dialog: Caesar looking right at us, signing:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [37 steps to the adult cage... 55 to the
dialog: children.]
speaker_heading: REVEAL MAURICE
text: lowering the binoculars; he ducks down behind the rocks --
text: -- where the Girl and Bad Ape await his command.
text: Maurice points to the Girl, then up at his eyes, looking
text: around -- as if to say, "You, keep a look out." The Girl
text: nods back very seriously, his little soldier.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE DUSTY COMPASS
text: from the airstream trailer. The NEEDLE QUIVERS as the

scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - AT THE CONCRETE-FILLED IMPASSE - DAY
text: Maurice stares at the compass in his hand as Bad Ape watches,
text: holding the flashlight... finally, Maurice lifts his head,
text: and POINTS TO TWO DIFFERENT SPOTS ALONG THE TUNNEL WALL.
text: Bad Ape nods eagerly, moves to one of the spots, and STARTS
text: TO DIG tentatively, looking to Maurice for approval; Maurice
text: nods, goes to the other spot, STARTS DIGGING as well.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH OVER THE CAMP - NIGHT
text: At gunpoint, apes roll MASSIVE SOPHISTICATED ARTILLERY out of
text: the depot at the base of the mountain, and along the train
text: tracks toward the barrier wall...
dialog: 89.
text: AT THE BARRIER WALL
text: A cluster of POWERFUL GORILLAS struggle to hoist an imposing

scene_heading: REVEAL -- WIDE ON THE NOW COMPLETED WALL -- MORE RAPIER
text: LAUNCHERS BEING POSITIONED BY APES AND SOLDIERS ALL ALONG THE

scene_heading: ON CAESAR -- WATCHING THE WALL FORTIFICATION
text: as Red and Preacher march him across the yard amidst masses
text: of weary apes being herded back to the pens; they arrive at --
speaker_heading: CAESAR'S CAGE
text: As Preacher starts to unlock the door, Caesar's gaze shifts
text: to Red, and then to the ANGRY WELT over Red's eye where
text: Rocket head-butted him; Red glowers, self-conscious.
text: Preacher opens the door, and Red shoves Caesar in. Then Red
text: steps forward to remove the chain leash from Caesar's neck
text: collar, pressing his face menacingly close to Caesar's:
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: You know Kerna shoot apes tomorrow...
dialog: when wall is done.
text: Caesar's eyes shift briefly to Preacher's, who looks away.
text: Then he turns back to Red:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: His wall is madness. It won't save him...
dialog: any more than it will save you.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: I save myself.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Is there anything left... of you to save?
text: A brief flash of uncertainty passes over Red as he meets
text: Caesar's piercing eyes... then he musters a final hard stare
text: at Caesar, and turns to go.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BINOCULAR POV

speaker_heading: THE GIRL
text: Watching from behind the rocks. She lowers the binoculars,
text: blinking out at the camp a beat...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: MOVING WITH THE GIRL THROUGH THE TUNNEL
text: Eyes wide, she searches for sign of Maurice or Bad Ape...
text: She approaches the cement-filled impasse... finding TWO NEWLY
text: DUG TUNNELS on either side of the blockage. She enters --
text: ONE OF THE NEW TUNNELS
text: She heads toward the distant glow of a flashlight up ahead...
text: Arriving behind Maurice, covered in dirt, still digging away.
text: He stops, noticing her. He looks at her quizzically --
text: points upward, makes a tentative thumbs up sign --
text: "everything ok up there?" She nods. He smiles:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [You are very brave.]
text: She looks at him, confused. He gently repeats the sign:
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)
dialog: [Brave.]
text: She hesitates, then slowly mimics him:
speaker_heading: THE GIRL
dialog: [...Brave?]
text: Maurice nods, proud; the Girl smiles, then signs uncertainly:
speaker_heading: THE GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: [Ape?]
text: Maurice doesn't understand -- she signs again:
speaker_heading: THE GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: [Me...? Ape?]
text: Maurice gets it now; stares back, struggling for an answer:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: [You are...]
text: Then he notices something. He leans forward and reaches out,
text: gently lifting the Chevy NOVA emblem poking out of her jacket
text: pocket. He shows it to her, smiling warmly as he SPEAKS:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAURICE (CONT'D)

text: BAD APE stands excitedly at the mouth of their tunnel.
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: Come! Come see!
text: As Maurice and Nova move to join him... we LINGER a beat,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE OTHER NEWLY-DUG TUNNEL
text: Bad Ape leads them forward as he WHISPERS, watching his feet:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: ...35 ...36 ...37.

text: Nova smiles mutely back at Bad Ape as Maurice looks up from
text: his compass, nods approvingly.
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispers, excited)
dialog: What now?
text: Maurice surveys the new tunnel, looking up at the ceiling...
text: then gets down on his hands and knees. He looks up at Bad
text: Ape, and pats his own back, gesturing for Bad Ape to climb
dialog: on. Bad Ape doesn't get it:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: What.
text: Maurice points up at the ceiling, then pats his own back
text: again -- and now it dawns on Bad Ape:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)

dialog: Noooo--
text: Shaking his head, Bad Ape starts to back away -- when Maurice
text: suddenly GRABS his ankle; Bad Ape goes silent, startled.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Maurice lets out a low, surprisingly MENACING GROWL... Bad
text: Ape takes a deep breath; then:
speaker_heading: BAD APE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ok.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMP - HIGH AND WIDE OVER THE APE PEN - NIGHT
text: The chained apes are being herded in. A SOLDIER stands
text: inside the pen door, ushering them through, waving his rifle.
text: CLOSE ON ONE OF THE SOLDIER'S BOOTS pressed into the ice and
text: dirt... when suddenly the TIPS OF APE FINGERS poke up from a
text: tiny hole in the ground below, inches from the man's toes...
text: Oblivious to the presence of the boot, the fingers continue
text: to widen the hole, clawing away at the earth... WE CUT --
speaker_heading: UNDERGROUND
text: where Bad Ape stands with his hands above his head, his
text: fingers reaching out through the hole. He stops digging for
text: a moment, straining his neck to look up --
text: THROUGH THE HOLE
text: horrified to discover the Soldier's boot in front of his
text: face! Bad Ape shrinks back -- when one of the apes amassing
text: above NOTICES him, staring down into the hole, perplexed.
text: Petrified, Bad Ape holds a finger to his lips --
text: The ape above suddenly gets it; he nods and holds out a hand,
text: inconspicuously signalling Bad Ape to hang tight -- becoming
text: a look-out... as nearby apes start to notice Bad Ape too...
speaker_heading: REVEAL MAURICE
text: Bad Ape's feet shifting nervously on his shoulders; Maurice
text: looks up uneasily, wondering what's taking so long...
dialog: BACK TO BAD APE
text: Eyes glued on the look-out ape, who still has his hand
text: raised, watching some unseen activity above... Finally, he
dialog: turns to Bad Ape again, NODS THE OK --
text: Bad Ape ventures up, PEERING anxiously through the hole to
text: see THE SOLDIER'S BOOTS walking away, LEAVING THE PEN. Once
text: the Soldier's gone, he relaxes a bit, turning to see --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: APES GATHERED ALL AROUND HIM
text: staring down into the hole with amazement... at the odd, dirt-
text: coated ape in his toque -- a total stranger to them.
text: Bad Ape smiles up at the crowd sheepishly -- when another ape
text: roughly presses his way through to the edge of the hole --
text: IT'S ROCKET. He stares down at Bad Ape, expressionless...
text: and then a big smile spreads across his face. He turns
text: excitedly to the look-out ape:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [This is the ape I told you about.]
text: They all stare at him again, fascinated. The look-out steps
dialog: forward, and SIGNS to Bad Ape:
speaker_heading: LOOK-OUT
dialog: [Thank you.]
text: But Bad Ape looks up insecurely, not understanding the sign;
text: seeing this, the look-out slowly reaches down into the hole,
text: OFFERING HIS HAND.
text: Bad Ape regards the hand uncertainly... then CLASPS it,
text: beaming. He stares up at his new friend, then pats his chest
text: with his other hand, bowing his head as he nods, quietly
dialog: fumbling for a way to introduce himself:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: ...Bad Ape.
dialog: (shaking other apes' hands)
dialog: Bad Ape... Bad Ape...
text: More and more apes jostle to get a look, greeting him warmly,
text: Bad Ape overcome by the affection from this new family.
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW
text: Maurice peers up at Bad Ape above him, trying to get a look
text: at what's going on -- when -- Nova tugs on his fur. He looks
text: at her, and she points --
scene_heading: DOWN THE TUNNEL
text: where a SMALL STREAM OF WATER is creeping toward them.
text: Maurice looks at the ground beneath him as the water starts
text: to pool around his feet; alarmed, he instinctively steps
text: forward to investigate -- forgetting Bad Ape on his
text: shoulders. Bad Ape tumbles to the wet floor, surprised.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Maurice spins, realizing; Bad Ape looks at the water around
text: him, confused. As Maurice bends to help him, Bad Ape glances
text: up, seeing something above -- Maurice follows his gaze to --
text: ROCKET peering over the edge of the hole with concern. His
text: eyes lock on Maurice's, immediately sensing trouble --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [What's wrong?]
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAESAR'S CAGE - NIGHT
text: Caesar waits alone, staring tensely at the apes across the
text: way, all huddled around the hole, backs to us. Rocket
text: suddenly breaks through the crowd to report to Caesar, who
text: has been anxiously awaiting news. Rocket looks grave:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [There's a problem.]
text: As worry creeps into Caesar's face, we CUT TO --
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - IMMEDIATELY
text: MUD AND WATER GUSH IN through a WIDENING FISSURE in the wall
text: where Maurice had been digging -- Maurice and Bad Ape try
text: desperately to plug the opening with earth and rocks...
scene_heading: EXT. YARD - THE PENS - NIGHT
text: We hear QUIET APE GRUNTING -- Caesar stands pressed to the
text: bars of his cage looking across to a large group of apes
text: gathered at the edge of their pen, all eyes fixed on Caesar.
text: CLOSER ON THE PEN
dialog: The apes in mid-debate --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [We can't dig any further, it will flood
dialog: the whole tunnel!]
speaker_heading: LAKE
dialog: [If we don't dig further, we'll never get
dialog: to the children! How are we going to get
dialog: them out?]
text: A sudden swell of APE GRUNTS echo the sentiment --
text: Caesar raises a hand to quiet the apes, peering around at the
text: GUARDS PATROLLING THE CAMP to see if the noise alerted them --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Rocket and some of the others glance up at THE GUARD TOWER
text: directly above Caesar's cage... where Boyle is leaning
text: suspiciously over the ledge. Boyle listens for a moment --
text: then, hearing no more commotion, leans back.
text: The apes all pause warily for a beat; then Lake signs
text: stealthily, worried:
speaker_heading: LAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: [We have to keep looking down there, see
dialog: if there's another way to reach the
dialog: children...]
text: But Caesar shakes his head, gravely serious:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [We must leave tonight!]
text: Pained, Caesar turns behind him, glances at the children, all
text: asleep in their pen -- he can see little Cornelius sleeping
text: too -- he turns back to the other, decisive:
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: [We'll have to get the children out above
dialog: ground!]
text: The apes exchange tense looks; then all look back at Caesar:
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [How...?]
scene_heading: EXT. WIDE SHOT OF THE CAMP - LATE NIGHT
text: The lights in the soldiers' barracks go out, one by one...
text: UP BY THE GUARD TOWER OVER THE ADULT APE PEN
text: Boyle steps slowly out onto the catwalk, quietly drinking
text: from a steaming thermos, staring out into the distance --
text: WHEN SPLAT! He is SUDDENLY PELTED HARD in the back of his
text: head with a handful of what looks like WET MUD from somewhere
text: below. Stunned, he looks at himself, wiping the disgusting
text: muck off: wtf?! He peers furiously over the railing at the
dialog: pen below --
speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: Hey -- you animals!
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: BOYLE
text: CHARGING down the tower ladder, heading for the pen! He
text: thrusts his keys into the lock, slides open the door, and
text: enters, shutting it behind him; he raises his gun at the
text: shackled apes who shuffle fearfully out of his way:
speaker_heading: BOYLE
dialog: Who did that?!
text: The apes cower, shaking their heads, protesting innocence --
text: when SPLAT! Another WAD of muck smacks the side of his head!
speaker_heading: BOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: SONUVA--!!!
text: He spins, swinging his rifle -- the chained apes rush out of
text: the way in panic, parting to reveal --
text: THE CULPRIT. It's Rocket, who stands his ground as he glares
text: back clutching another fistful of muck... Boyle recognizes
dialog: him:
speaker_heading: BOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: You...
text: Livid, he raises his gun, about to shoot -- when an ORANGUTAN
text: HAND SEIZES HIS ANKLE from below and YANKS HIM DOWN INTO THE
text: HOLE IN THE GROUND! The Apes all stare at the hole...
text: And a moment later, BOYLE'S KEYS are TOSSED BACK UP.
text: Rocket moves forward and snatches them up. He looks down
text: into the hole at Maurice; they share a determined look; then
scene_heading: Maurice HANDS HIM UP Boyle's RIFLE --
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S CAGE - SIMULTANEOUS
text: Caesar urgently feels for something along the wall above the
text: cage door -- until he finds where he's hidden Preacher's key.
text: He bends down and immediately begins unshackling his feet...
text: He gets one free -- when -- he hears FOOTSTEPS... He stops,
text: quickly turns, seeing --
text: THE FIGURE OF THE COLONEL approaching in the distance.
text: Caesar straightens, carefully palming the key, eyes on the
text: Colonel heading toward the pens... as Rocket, across the way,
text: slowly hides Boyle's rifle behind his back...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: But as the Colonel arrives, mysteriously he doesn't even
text: glance at the apes, instead staring off at the finished wall
text: in the distance, lost in thought... He continues right past
text: them... stopping 20 paces away, back to us... He just stands
text: there, motionless, taking the sight in.
text: Caesar watches the Colonel anxiously -- when -- the Colonel
text: turns. He starts slowly back... heading to Caesar's cage.
text: As he comes closer, we can see he is still in a fog. Caesar
text: is surprised to see the FLASK grasped absently in his hand.
text: A strange silent beat. And finally, the Colonel speaks --
text: his tone is oddly vacant:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: Least you can take comfort... Your
dialog: struggle ends... Ours goes on... Nature
dialog: still has the power to wipe us off this
dialog: planet at any moment... Killed the
text: dinosaurs with a single meteor.
text: He eerily studies Caesar's body... musing to himself:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You apes are so strong... I wonder...
dialog: what kind of world you would have
dialog: built... on our graves.
text: Caesar's eyes search the Colonel's, trying to make sense of
text: his demeanor. The Colonel gazes off, as if lost in a dream:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You know when I first got to the city...
dialog: a man said he had to see me. He said he
dialog: knew you. That you worked together.
text: Caesar looks surprised. Beat. Finally, warily:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: ...Malcolm?
text: Caesar's voice pulls the Colonel out of his reverie for a
text: moment -- he looks at Caesar a bit confused; then, realizing:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: I think that was his name, yes.
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: He... was a friend.
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: He said you were remarkable. More than
dialog: just an animal...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: you were a great leader. I thought he
dialog: was crazy... But I almost see what he
dialog: meant.
dialog: (he drifts off again)
dialog: He pleaded with me to find you. To make
dialog: peace with you.
text: Caesar is rapt, stunned by these revelations... But the
text: Colonel is wholly unaware of Caesar's reaction, staring off
text: in a long unnerving silence. Caesar hesitates, then:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: What... happened to this man?
text: The Colonel remains staring off a moment longer, then finally
text: looks at Caesar... and then off again:
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL
dialog: I shot him.
text: He remains still a moment longer -- then suddenly looks
text: around, disoriented, as if awakened from a dream --
speaker_heading: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly paranoid)
dialog: What's going on here?
text: Caesar frowns at him, disquieted and perplexed... The
text: Colonel's eyes dart suspiciously around him; he cranes his
text: neck to peer up through the falling snow at the guard tower,
text: but the angle is too steep to see if anyone is up there --
text: A CLANK at his feet makes him look down... where he finds
text: he's dropped his flask. He picks it up, looks at it as if
dialog: having no memory of even bringing it out here.
text: Suddenly self-conscious, he looks around at the apes in their
text: pen, all staring back at him -- and then at Caesar. He
text: slowly backs away, then turns, retreating through the
text: darkness to his tower.
text: Caesar watches him go, then turns to find Rocket and the
text: other apes looking at him, confused.
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [...What was that?]
text: Caesar shakes his head, just as confused. Then returns to
text: action, bending down to unshackle his other ankle -- he
text: unlocks it -- then TOSSES PREACHER'S KEY TO --
text: ROCKET, who reaches through the pen bars and catches them mid-
text: air; he quickly unshackles himself, TOSSES THE KEY to --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: LAKE, who immediately starts to unshackle herself -- she
text: passes the keys down the line of her chain gang, they all
text: begin to unshackle themselves too --
text: ROCKET moves to the pen door, uses BOYLE'S KEYS to unlock it
text: -- then tosses BOYLE'S KEYS across to --
text: CAESAR, who starts to unlock his cage -- when he notices
text: something -- he holds up his hand! Everyone freezes. They
dialog: all look up at --
scene_heading: THE WARDEN'S TOWER
text: to see the Colonel stepping toward his lighted window, his
text: face in SILHOUETTE -- he might be staring down at them, or
text: off into the distance, it's impossible to tell...
text: Caesar and Rocket share a tense look --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Do you think he knows we're up to
dialog: something?]
text: Unsure, Caesar peers back up at the Colonel's silhouette.
text: After a beat, the Colonel steps away from the window. Rocket
text: looks anxiously at Caesar, raising the rifle:
speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
dialog: [Now?]
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: [Wait till he turns out his lights.]
text: HOLD as they stare at the lighted window, waiting...
text: waiting... SOUNDS OF FIERCELY GUSTING WIND rising... as we --
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. YARD - WIDE ON THE TOWER AND PENS - LATER
text: IT'S SNOWING HARD NOW, a fresh layer blanketing everything.
text: And still, the Colonel's lights remain on. The apes are all
text: pressed to the bars of their pen, eyes fixed up on the
text: Colonel's window; some pace, tortured by the wait...
text: PUSHING IN ON CAESAR
text: Staring up with coiled intensity, totally still... His gaze
text: shifts to Rocket, whose eyes are locked on Caesar --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [The sun will be up soon...]
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Torn, Caesar steals a final look at the lighted window...
text: then turns back to Rocket -- forced to make the call:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: [We go now. Or die trying.]
text: Rocket nods -- he waits as the SEARCHLIGHT PASSES, then darts
text: out of the pen, holding the stolen rifle -- crossing to
text: Caesar's cage, as Caesar steps out -- they both streak --
text: TOWARD THE SOLDIERS' BARRACKS
text: ducking into an alley between the building and the children's
text: pen -- they press against the barrack's wall, peering down
dialog: the alley to see --
text: SOLDIERS PASSING BY THE CHILDREN'S PEN
text: Caesar waits until the Soldiers cross out of sight -- then
text: looks to Rocket, and they head for --
scene_heading: THE CHILDREN'S PEN
text: A small cluster of kids rush to the door as Caesar unlocks
text: it; others stir from their sleep, scrambling over to see --
text: Caesar and Rocket enter. The little apes swarm around them,
text: wide-eyed. Caesar gently pats their heads, shushing them --
text: when suddenly he sees HIS SON in the crowd. Cornelius breaks
text: into a run, clambering up over the backs of the others...
text: straight into Caesar's arms. Emotion floods Caesar's face as
text: he tightly embraces his son...
speaker_heading: CAESAR
text: (overcome, holding him
dialog: tight)
dialog: I love you, son...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A POV THROUGH A DOORWAY AT A GUARD TOWER
text: We glimpse the side of the Guard's head as he stares down,
dialog: eating --
text: REVEAL ROCKET, keeping lookout on the guard from the doorway;
text: behind him the children are huddled with Caesar -- Caesar
text: hustles the children toward a LIGHT POLE, quickly hoisting
text: one after another up onto it --
scene_heading: CUT WIDER OVER THE CHILDREN'S PEN
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: where we see Caesar, Rocket and the children are on a second
text: story landing, dangerously close to the Guard Tower -- the
text: little apes scale the tall light pole, scrambling out onto --
scene_heading: THE ELECTRICAL LINE
text: suspended high over the Guard Towers and camp --
text: As SNOW SWIRLS HARD all around them, the children make their
text: way back toward the adult pen -- directly over the heads of
dialog: the unwitting Soldiers below!
scene_heading: IN THE ADULT PEN
text: The children arrive on the wire above and begin dropping down
text: silently, one by one -- into the waiting arms of Lake and
text: other unchained apes -- the apes urgently hand the kids off
text: to their anxious parents.
text: As the emotional reunions continue, Caesar (Cornelius
text: clinging around his neck) and Rocket finally arrive overhead
text: too, each dropping down into the grasp of the massive
text: gorillas waiting below.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
text: Staring up urgently from the hole in the adult pen... as
text: Caesar and the apes converge above; Caesar and Rocket begin
text: HANDING THE CHILDREN DOWN...
speaker_heading: IN THE HOLE
text: Maurice lowers the kids to the tunnel floor; they look up to
text: find Nova extending her hand... and they start off after her
dialog: down the tunnel...
scene_heading: EXT. ROCK-OUTCROPPING OUTSIDE CAMP - TOP OF HOLE - PRE-DAWN
text: Bad Ape clutches himself, shivering nervously in the wind --
text: when he hears a NOISE FROM BELOW; he looks down to see --
text: Nova leading the apes out of the tunnel, and pointing them up
text: the ladder toward Bad Ape; he smiles sweetly, reaching down
text: to the frightened children as he WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: It's ok, little ones... come, come.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 102.
text: THE EDGE OF THE OUTCROPPING
text: Bad Ape pokes his head around a boulder, peeking up through
dialog: his BINOCULARS at --
text: A GUARD POST ALONG THE BARRIER WALL
text: where Soldiers pace, scanning the distant, dark horizon...
text: BAD APE turns behind him, where Maurice and Nova are now
text: huddled with all the ape children -- Bad Ape gestures as he
speaker_heading: WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: Go! Go go go...!
text: Nova climbs onto Maurice's back, and they rush off, leading
text: the little apes SINGLE FILE from behind the rocks, dashing
text: out across an EXPOSED STRETCH OF FLATS under the cover of
text: darkness -- and heading up into the mountain on the side of
dialog: the camp...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: BACK IN THE ADULT PEN
text: Caesar slowly moves toward the fence, staring out at
text: something tensely, as behind him Rocket urgently ushers apes
text: down into the hole. As the last of the apes descend, Rocket
text: turns to see Caesar is staring up at the Warden's Tower.
dialog: Rocket moves to Caesar, urgent --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Hurry! Let's go!]
text: But Caesar stays motionless, eyes fixed intently on the
text: Colonel's still lighted window.
speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
dialog: [Caesar, what's wrong?]
text: Caesar stares darkly at the tower, preoccupied:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: By the time the sun rises, you'll all be
dialog: on your way... to a new home.
dialog: (finally, he turns)
dialog: Hurry, you must go.
text: And now it hits Rocket, Caesar is not coming with him --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Without you? No...]
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Caesar sees the pain in Rocket's face, and it pains him too;
text: but something still burns inside him:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Maurice was right. I am like Koba. He
dialog: could not escape his hate...
text: (his eyes fix on the tower
dialog: again)
dialog: And I still cannot escape mine. He took
dialog: too much from me.
text: After a long moment, he turns back to Rocket; Rocket nods,
text: his eyes now unexpectedly emotional. Caesar puts a hand
text: around Rocket's head, pulls his forehead against his -- a
text: final embrace. He pulls back, says softly:
speaker_heading: CAESAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Go...
text: Rocket looks at him, then reluctantly starts for the hole.
text: He takes one last look at Caesar, and begins to descend.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BAD APE
text: excitedly waving on the children, sending them off toward the
text: mountain -- when an OMINOUS RUMBLING begins, shaking the
text: ground. Alarmed, Bad Ape looks quickly up at --
text: THE GUARD POST ALONG THE BARRIER WALL
text: where Soldiers react to the sound, startled -- anxiously
text: scanning the horizon -- suddenly SEEING something in the
dialog: distance -- as --
speaker_heading: BAD APE
text: TURNS to the horizon too, lifts his binoculars --
scene_heading: BAD APE'S BINOCULAR POV
text: Through snowy haze, we can make out the cock-eyed headlights
text: of A HUGE ARMADA OF MILITARY VEHICLES APPROACHING INEXORABLY
text: -- their hulking shapes advancing across the frozen tundra.
text: As ALARMS SOUND all along the wall --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: EXT. YARD - THE BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS
text: LIGHTS blink on in the windows as waking SOLDIERS flood into
text: the yard with weapons -- we PAN WITH THEM as they RUSH for

speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Holy shit -- they're here!!!
text: As they race by, the CAMERA FINDS CAESAR, hidden, crouched
text: beside the building, watching them go, taking this news in...
text: He waits until the Soldiers pass, then BOLTS UP ONTO --
scene_heading: THE BARRACKS ROOF
text: We MOVE WITH CAESAR -- as he races along the edge, below him
text: we see the tide of Soldiers storming in the opposite
text: direction... Finally, Caesar STOPS --
scene_heading: BENEATH THE WARDEN'S TOWER
text: He hears FRANTIC BANGING below. He peers down to see --
text: A GROUP OF OFFICERS POUNDING on the STEEL DOOR of the tower --
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.)
dialog: COLONEL! COLONEL!!!
dialog: (turns to one of the men)
scene_heading: OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR, SOLDIER!
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (O.S.)
text: I CAN'T! IT'S BLOCKED FROM INSIDE, SIR!
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.)
dialog: WHERE THE HELL IS HE?!
speaker_heading: SOLDIER (O.S.)
text: I DON'T KNOW, SIR! WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE
scene_heading: COLONEL ALL NIGHT!
text: Caesar ducks back, quickly stares up at the tower overhead --
text: SPOTS the Colonel's OPEN WINDOW four stories above... He
text: takes a last look around -- then LEAPS across from the
text: barracks' roof to the side of the tower...
scene_heading: EXT. YARD - PRE-DAWN
text: More Soldiers rush past -- when one SLOWS, looking RIGHT AT
text: US in utter shock. It's Preacher:
speaker_heading: PREACHER
dialog: Jesus Christ...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: PAN with him as he steps right past the camera to REVEAL --

speaker_heading: PREACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: THE APES!!! THEY'RE GONE!!!
scene_heading: INT. WARDEN'S TOWER - CONTROL ROOM - PRE-DAWN
text: Caesar silently climbs in the window; he looks around... and
text: immediately spots an unnerving, incongruous sight --
text: THE FRONT DOOR is BARRICADED WITH FURNITURE from the inside.
text: Confused, Caesar looks around, sees the area in total
text: disarray: a SMALL STOCKPILE OF MUNITIONS lie scattered
text: chaotically across a table, alongside a tray of HALF-EATEN
text: FOOD and the Colonel's SPILLED FLASK...
text: Soaked in liquid from the flask is a PHOTO OF A LITTLE BOY;
text: beside it OLD WAR MEDALS; Caesar peers around, wary: where's
dialog: the Colonel...?
scene_heading: EXTREME WIDE SHOT - IN FRONT OF THE CAMP
text: A SERIES OF INTENSELY BRIGHT RAPIER MISSILES rip into the sky
text: from atop the barrier wall, SOARING HIGH ABOVE THE ROCKY
text: OUTCROPPING, illuminating the landscape below --
scene_heading: TOP OF THE HOLE
text: Bad Ape shudders, watching the missiles -- as they EXPLODE
text: into the path of the armada -- TWO OF THE FRONT VEHICLES
speaker_heading: ERUPT!
text: Panicked, he frantically urges the children --
speaker_heading: BAD APE
dialog: Hurry! Go go go!
text: When A SUDDEN ROAR AND BLINDING FLASH makes him turn to see --
text: ARTILLERY SHELLS SOARING in return from the giant vehicles --
text: Bad Ape LUNGES protectively over nearby children -- when --
text: BOOOOMM!!! The SHELLS MAKE IMPACT 30 feet from the wall!
text: DEBRIS HAILS DOWN on our group as they hug the ground!
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
dialog: 106.
text: THE TUNNELS BELOW -- CROWDED WITH ESCAPING APES
text: They stop, look around in fear as the space RUMBLES VIOLENTLY
text: around them -- alarmed, ROCKET begins pushing his way through
text: the crush to get to the other end, gripping his rifle --
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: [Let me through!]
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
scene_heading: CAESAR IN THE WARDEN'S TOWER
text: He whips his head at the sound of continued shelling --
text: panicked, he rushes to the window to see INCOMING MISSILES
text: FROM THE ARMADA beginning to make IMPACT INSIDE THE YARD -- !
text: When a QUIET CRASH comes from somewhere close behind him.
text: Caesar turns, startled, gaze fixing apprehensively on a
text: PARTIALLY OPENED DOORWAY; he steels himself, and slowly
text: approaches the door.
text: He hesitates, wary... then carefully peers around the door
text: frame, glimpsing a BROKEN COLEMAN LAMP at the foot of a small
text: table; kerosine still pools from the lamp's base.
text: Beyond the door, Caesar suddenly hears labored breathing...
text: He pushes it open to REVEAL...
scene_heading: THE COLONEL'S SLEEPING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN/INTO DAWN
text: The Colonel is splayed on his stomach across a military cot --
text: head lowered, his outstretched hand trembles mid-air as he
text: struggles in a total daze, like a drunk, grasping helplessly
text: for something out of reach on the table... HIS PISTOL.
text: Heart racing, Caesar crosses silently to the table... eyes
text: glued to the Colonel, he places his hand firmly on the gun
text: before the Colonel can get to it.
text: Caesar lifts the gun slowly, then trains it down at the
text: Colonel beneath him, who is so out of it he continues
text: listlessly groping for a gun that isn't there.
text: Caesar glares down at the Colonel, pitiless... his expression
text: hardening as he prepares to finish him, once and for all --
text: -- when the Colonel slowly lifts his head to peer up at
text: Caesar... and for the first time, Caesar sees there is BLOOD
text: smeared on his face from under his nose.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The Colonel's eyes look desperate, like a wounded animal's;
text: he opens his mouth pleadingly, trying to speak -- but the
text: only sounds that come are eerie, GASPING GRUNTS...
text: Caesar stares back in utter shock -- when he notices
text: something on the floor near the bed...
text: It's Nova's crude RAG DOLL, silently gazing up at him, now

text: Reeling, Caesar unconsciously lowers the gun -- but as the
text: Colonel reaches lamely for it, Caesar instantly remembers
text: himself, raising the weapon threateningly again at his head --
text: But the Colonel doesn't even flinch, the barrel just inches
text: from his face. He begins quietly gasping once more; Caesar
text: watches, unnerved, finger on the trigger, as the Colonel
text: lifts himself, slowly leaning his head forward...
text: ...and pressing his own temple against the muzzle -- he looks
text: up at Caesar, his tortured eyes pleading mutely for death.
speaker_heading: HOLD ON CAESAR
text: as he stares down, haunted... his gaze shifting from the
text: Colonel's agonized face... to the gun in his hand...
text: Finally, horrified, he slowly LOWERS THE GUN. Self-awareness
text: returns to his eyes -- a look of humanity we haven't fully
text: seen since before the death of his family, as if the war
text: within him is finally coming to an end.
text: The Colonel gapes helplessly... as Caesar, quietly stunned by
text: his own decision, starts to back away... Caesar pauses,
text: pitying eyes on the Colonel's; then finally, he gently sets
text: the gun back down onto the table.
text: A look of confused gratitude flickers through the Colonel's
text: primitive gaze... and he resumes REACHING LAMELY for the gun.
text: Eyes still on him, Caesar backs slowly out --
scene_heading: INTO THE CONTROL ROOM
text: We see Caesar, his back to us, as he continues gazing into
text: the Colonel's sleeping quarters... then, after a quiet,
text: clumsy fumbling sound, a SINGLE GUNSHOT echoes from the room.
text: Caesar remains still, then lowers his head as day breaks
dialog: outside...

scene_heading: UP ON THE BARRIER WALL - DAYLIGHT NOW
text: Through SWIRLING SNOW we see RED and other TURNCOATS arrive

text: Soldiers around them unleash another round of Rapier missiles
text: -- WHOOOOSH -- two more MLRS vehicles EXPLODE on the horizon!
text: Soldiers around the missile launcher react with raucous
text: cheers to the direct hits, a sense that the battle's theirs
dialog: to win --
text: -- when the GUNNER beside Red suddenly NOTICES THE APES
text: scrambling by the rock out-cropping -- his jaw drops, in
dialog: complete shock!
speaker_heading: GUNNER
dialog: (screams to the others)
dialog: LOOK!!! THE APES!!!

scene_heading: EXT. WARDEN'S TOWER - WINDOW - IMMEDIATELY
text: We see Caesar about to climb out -- when he SEES the apes
text: taking heavy fire from gunners on the wall! He freezes,
text: terror-stricken, grappling for a way to save them -- when his
text: eyes lock on the TANKER CARS just beneath the wall --
text: He quickly turns from the window, charging back into the
dialog: control room -- when --
text: A SUDDEN BANGING comes from the front door --
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE OFFICER (O.S.)
dialog: Colonel! Are you in there?! Colonel!
text: Caesar spins, startled -- then finishes grabbing a BANDOLIER
text: OF GRENADES off the table strewn with the Colonel's
text: belongings -- he bolts for the window -- when --
text: CRASH! The door SMASHES OPEN -- Caesar turns to see the X.O.
text: AND HIS MEN ENTERING -- they see him too -- raising their
scene_heading: weapons, and FIRING AS -- CAESAR LEAPS
dialog: 109.
text: OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW!!!
text: HE SWINGS DOWN FROM THE TOWER LEDGE -- and GRASPS onto the
text: FLAGPOLE stretched across the open space beneath -- the pole
text: breaks his fall, but only so much -- as ONE SIDE SNAPS FREE!
text: Caesar hangs on, riding the swinging pole as it descends --
text: and finally releasing it, tumbling to the ground!
text: Caesar scrambles to his feet, still clutching the grenades --
text: -- when the Officer and his men appear in the tower window!
text: They OPEN FIRE -- as Caesar sprints away -- bullets tearing
text: up snow and ice right behind him as he goes -- !
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ROCKET - AT THE ROCK OUT-CROPPING
text: DESPERATELY FIRING Boyle's automatic rifle, trying to provide
text: cover for the FLEEING APES who are now PINNED BELOW IN CHAOS
text: -- as BEHIND HIM ON THE ROCKS, Bad Ape and another HORDE OF
text: APES are gathered helplessly around the hole, some apes still
text: crawling out to discover there's now nowhere to go...
text: UP ON THE BARRIER WALL
text: The Gunner ducks from Rocket's bullets, then jumps back up,
text: returning a mad volley from his machine gun, SHOUTING over
text: the din to the other soldiers firing beside him --
speaker_heading: GUNNER
dialog: Kill them, man!!! Kill them all!!!
text: REVEAL RED behind them, watching the apes under attack -- the

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: QUADRUPEDING at great speed for the yard, as another incoming
text: mortar hits the ground -- Caesar DARTS HARD around the front
text: of the pen -- and fearlessly straight through the PLUMING
text: DEBRIS and SWIRLING SNOW -- a heroic battlefield image!
text: Mesmerized, Red watches motionless as Caesar charges
text: fearlessly through the chaos toward the TANKER directly
text: beneath gunners on the wall!
text: Caesar continues through the smoke and debris -- finally
text: grabbing one of the grenades from the bandolier -- eyes fixed
text: on the tanker just 30 feet away -- rearing back, about to
text: pull the pin -- WHEN SUDDENLY --
text: CAESAR DROPS, CLUTCHING HIS SIDE -- TUMBLING TO THE GROUND!
text: Shocked, Red watches as Caesar, in agony, touches his
text: abdomen, discovering BLOOD; Caesar reaches behind him to find
text: he's been shot in the back with a CROSSBOW ARROW...
text: Red looks up to see -- PREACHER stalking through the haze and
text: snow, out of the pen area, almost shocked himself at what he
text: has just done -- he nervously loads another arrow, in turmoil
text: as he moves toward Caesar.
text: Gasping in pain, Caesar SNAPS the arrow from his side, and
text: turns, seeing Preacher too...
text: Red stands frozen, gripped by the sight of Caesar lying there
dialog: helpless --
speaker_heading: GUNNER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: GODAMMIT!!!
text: Red turns, startled, to find the Gunner screaming at him,
text: momentarily turned from the battle --
speaker_heading: GUNNER (CONT'D)
dialog: YOU STUPID DONKEY!!! WHERE'S MY
dialog: LAUNCHER!?!
text: Red suddenly looks at the weapon in his hands, remembering
text: what he was ordered to do -- still returning to his senses,
text: he nods to the Gunner -- who immediately turns back to the
text: battle, FIRING RELENTLESSLY at the apes...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CAESAR ON THE GROUND
text: as he sees Preacher anxiously closing in... Caesar's eyes
text: frantically dart for an avenue of escape, but there is none.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: His pained gaze returns to Preacher who comes to a stop just
text: 25 feet away, hesitating, torn -- then, finally steeling
text: himself, he raises the LOADED CROSSBOW -- when --
text: FSSSSSSST--KABLOOM! Preacher DISAPPEARS in a HUGE BLAST!!!
text: AND EVERYTHING GOES INSTANTLY SILENT, THE SOUND REPLACED BY A
scene_heading: QUIET RINGING --
text: Stunned, disoriented, Caesar looks around him, deafened,
text: finally peering up to discover --
text: RED ON THE WALL holding the SMOKING LAUNCHER, looking down
text: stoically.
text: Caesar can't believe it... He gazes up in shock at --
text: RED, who just gazes back, calmly holding the weapon, almost
text: in a state of peace -- while BEHIND HIM --
text: THE GUNNER turns, suddenly realizing what Red has just done,
text: freaking out, his SCREAMING INAUDIBLE to Caesar's ringing
text: ears -- the Gunner pulls out his PISTOL -- pointing it at
text: Red, who doesn't even react -- we see just a split-second of
text: his SILENT MUZZLE FLASH -- when we CUT --
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON CAESAR
text: as he takes in the grim sight, pained -- THEN --
text: THE GUNNER turns and takes aim at CAESAR!
text: Caesar scrambles, the sounds around him (and us) suddenly
text: starting to return -- as -- he SNATCHES UP THE GRENADE from
text: the ground beside him -- jumping to his feet --
text: -- narrowly dodging the Gunner's bullets tearing up earth
text: around him -- as he PULLS THE PIN from the grenade,
text: desperately LAUNCHING it straight for the tanker beneath the
dialog: wall --
text: The Gunner's alarmed eyes suddenly whip toward the tanker --
text: as Caesar takes off, sprinting in the opposite direction --
text: -- when the grenade EXPLODES and THE TANKER ERUPTS --
text: ENGULFING the WALL beside it, and consuming all the Gunners
text: above in its INCREDIBLE BLAST!!!
text: Caesar races into the adult pen -- as behind him, FLAMES
text: CLIMB HIGH INTO THE SKY -- when SUDDENLY -- THE TRAIN CAR
text: NEXT TO THE TANKER EXPLODES TOO!
text: Still running, Caesar steals a startled look back -- as
text: ANOTHER CAR EXPLODES!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

text: SWEEPS AROUND HIM -- AND HE EMERGES -- TUMBLING OUT --
text: THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ROCKY OUTCROPPING
text: And flat onto his stomach!
text: Finally, he lifts his head to see the feet of apes all
text: around, their backs to him -- as he rises, he finds them all
text: staring out beyond the outcropping in awe...
text: He slowly presses his way through the crowd, climbing higher
text: on the rocks... to discover their eyes all fixed on...
text: THE UTTERLY DECIMATED PRISON, engulfed in a massive
text: conflagration as a STORM OF DEBRIS RAINS DOWN FROM THE SKY...
text: Now seeing Caesar, Rocket and Bad Ape turn, stunned at the

dialog: looks --
text: -- when MECHANICAL GROANS beside them make them all turn to
dialog: see --
text: THE REMAINING ARMADA as it finally arrives, braking to a stop

dialog: as well -- to see --

dialog: And it's heading their way --
scene_heading: A HUMAN VOICE CRIES OUT
dialog: AVALAAAAAAANCHE...!!!

speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
scene_heading: CAESAR AND THE APES RUNNING - FURTHER DOWN THE MOUNTAIN

speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
text: CAESAR REACHING THE TREE TOP

scene_heading: TIGHT ON CAESAR
text: CLINGING to the trunk, an elemental fight against the RAGING
text: WHITENESS -- holding on for life as snow HOWLS DEAFENINGLY
text: around him, ripping at his body... until finally, as quickly
text: as it began, the tide subsides... suddenly leaving us in --
text: A STUNNING SILENCE.
text: Caesar peers around in a daze to find himself in a SURREAL
text: HAZE OF WHITE, as if in a heavenly cloud... And slowly, the
text: mist begins to clear...
text: Caesar stares down from the tree top to discover an
dialog: incredible sight below...
text: EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE ARE GONE, THE ENTIRE CANYON BURIED IN
text: PRISTINE SNOW... It's as if nothing was ever here.
text: He stares for a moment in disbelief -- when sounds of apes
text: ECHO through the landscape -- he lifts his head to see --
text: THE APES, all clinging to the tree tops all around him. They
text: look at him, their savior, the chorus of ape sounds growing
text: louder... more exuberant... triumphant. They raise their
text: fists in solidarity and tribute to Caesar...
text: A smile begins to spread across Caesar's face, as he raises a

scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: A SERIES OF EPIC 65MM SUPER-WIDE LANDSCAPES, DAVID LEAN-STYLE
text: THE APE EXODUS moving on foot across SNOWY PLAINS...
text: CLOSER ON CAESAR as he pulls Bad Ape's blanket tighter around
text: Cornelius and himself, shielding them both from the cold. We
text: HOLD on Caesar's face, etched with strain, but determination
dialog: too...
dialog: 115.
text: through the sands of STUNNING MOJAVE DESERT VISTAS...
text: ...until they reach what looks like a vast, arid wasteland,
text: passing the outskirts of a DECIMATED NUCLEAR POWER PLANT...
speaker_heading: MOVE CLOSER
text: As Caesar, Cornelius on his shoulder, walks with the others
text: past a huge, rusted SIGN: "FORBIDDEN ZONE." Caesar looks to
text: Rocket, uncertain... but Rocket points reassuringly ahead...
text: at a DISTANT DESERT VOLCANO. As they continue onward, we --
scene_heading: DISSOLVE AGAIN TO:
scene_heading: THE TOP OF THE DESERT VOLCANO
text: The mass of apes scaling up, and finally cresting over the
text: lip... Caesar pauses momentarily in shock, and then we PAN
text: with him as he and the others step forward to REVEAL:
scene_heading: A GORGEOUS LUSHLY-OVERGROWN GREEN CRATER, a CRYSTAL BLUE LAKE
text: at its center; a kind of paradise, a place to begin again...
text: Exhausted, Caesar has to sit for a moment on one of the mossy
text: rocks, taking in the beauty as the apes excitedly pass,
text: exploring the incredible landscape of their new home...
text: Maurice arrives beside him, Nova on his back; Cornelius peeks
text: curiously over his father's shoulder, fascinated with her.
text: She smiles shyly, when a bunch of ape children race playfully
text: past, jostling and scurrying. Both turn, watching them go.
text: Then Nova hops off Maurice, eager to join in the fun. She
text: pauses, turning back to Cornelius, holding out a hand...
text: Cornelius climbs carefully down, then stops, looking up
text: uncertainly at Caesar, not sure if he's ready yet to leave
text: his father's side. Touched, Caesar smiles down at his son;
text: he kneels before him, caressing his face gently, filled with
text: great emotion... then he nods gently for him to go play --
text: and he and Nova hurry off.
text: Maurice and Caesar share a look, a pair of proud fathers.
text: They both turn to watch little Cornelius and the other ape
text: children playing with the lone human girl. A strange, joyous
text: sight. Pleased, Maurice turns back to Caesar, discovers him
text: watching with profound emotion on his face -- when to
text: Maurice's surprise, Caesar LOSES BALANCE for a moment...
text: Maurice stares with concern as Caesar rights himself, WINCING
text: in pain, avoiding Maurice's eyes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: And then Maurice reaches out, gently pulls the blanket back,
text: which has slipped down Caesar's shoulder... and for the first
text: time, Maurice sees CAESAR'S HAND, cupped to his side; it is
text: soaked in BLOOD.
text: Caesar glances up, finds Maurice staring at him, suddenly
text: distraught. A long unspoken look passes between them,
text: Caesar's sad smile confirming Maurice's worst fears. The
text: exchange between the old friends is heartbreaking. Finally,
text: Caesar speaks, a sense of contentment in his quiet voice:
speaker_heading: CAESAR
dialog: Don't worry... You are all home now.
dialog: Apes are strong. With... or without me.
text: Tears well in Maurice's eyes, as Caesar smiles peacefully --
text: -- when the playful sounds of ape children suddenly draw him
text: back to the toddlers again. Maurice watches as Caesar's eyes
text: fix wistfully on his son... a sense of tremendous melancholy
text: setting in, as his breathing grows more labored...
text: Maurice grunts gently. Caesar slowly turns back to him, and
dialog: Maurice speaks:
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (filled with emotion)
dialog: Son will know... who was father... and
dialog: what Caesar... did... for us.
text: Caesar smiles, tears now in his eyes too. He turns back to
text: his son for a last look... As we CUT CLOSE ON --
scene_heading: HIS ICONIC GREEN EYES
text: A FINAL SLOW DISSOLVE BEGINS -- TO A WIDE SHOT OVER THE APE
text: PARADISE... for a moment, the eyes and the landscape of apes
text: linger together -- then, as Caesar's eyes peacefully shut, we
text: FINISH DISSOLVING TO THE WIDE -- and gently TIP UP to the
text: TRANQUIL SKY -- HOLD, as the sounds of apes echo...
text: CUT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: THE END
