scene_heading: INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A phone rings in the dark. A little light falls from the
text: open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone. It
text: sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty
text: bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays.
scene_heading: EXT. PHIL'S TRIKE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the
text: night at great speed. The trike is moving very quickly,
text: its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels
text: sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver
text: fights to keep it on the road. This is PHIL KAUFMAN, and
text: he's in a hurry.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Two figures are struggling on the floor. The male is
text: naked. The woman sits astride him, her movements urgent,
text: her breath fast. They appear to be having sex.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRIKE. DAWN
dialog: 
text: The Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show
text: desert, more desert, and then... a giant bright, flickering
text: neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: That phone - still ringing; shrill, insistent. There is a
text: bed next to the table. It is covered in clothes, but there
text: is also a man's shape, which now moves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A little more light, and it now appears as if our man and
text: woman are struggling. There is fear on her face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly
text: off the bed. We see the man from behind as he shakes the
dialog: sleep away and looks for the damn phone.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The woman is screaming now, and banging on the man's chest
text: with her fists. He is motionless underneath her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN. DAWN
dialog: 
text: The Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the
text: driver leaps off. He runs at the door, throwing it open in
text: one movement, disappearing into the room. A broken striped
text: 'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The man finally answers the phone. At last the ringing
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking
text: quickly through the room.
dialog: 
text: As he searches, we hear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Oh my God please help me! I
dialog: found your number in his pocket
dialog: and I don't know... I don't know
dialog: what to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL'S VOICE
dialog: Ah, what... who are you?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: He's dead... he's dead... and
dialog: I'm... just... I don't know what
dialog: to do.
dialog: 
text: The man glances into the bathroom and opens some drawers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL'S VOICE
dialog: Hold on. Tell me who's dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Parsons. Gram Parsons. We met
dialog: in a bar and we had a lot to
dialog: drink and he just...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL'S VOICE
dialog: Are you sure he's dead?
dialog: 
text: He looks under the beds.
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Yeah. He's really dead. He
dialog: just...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL'S VOICE
dialog: Listen. Call an ambulance.
dialog: Where are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Joshua Tree. Joshua Tree Inn.
dialog: Room eight.
dialog: 
text: He checks on top of the wardrobe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL'S VOICE
dialog: Have you got a car?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL'S VOICE
dialog: Call an ambulance. Then get out
dialog: of there. Okay? Okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Yeah, okay. I'm goin'...
dialog: 
text: He picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and
text: glances at it. He turns and walks past us to the car and
text: for the first time we see Phil Kaufman's face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING
dialog: 
text: The Trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital.
text: There are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a
text: reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background.
text: Phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks
text: to the entrance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: We move through the reception area up to the nurses'
text: station. Phil is in conversation with a large woman in a
text: nurse's uniform.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You wanna run that by me again,
dialog: sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Okay. I'd like to see Gram
dialog: Parsons.
dialog: 
text: They stare at each other.
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You want to see Gram Parsons?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yes. Alone, if possible. And
dialog: would you have a gurney standing
dialog: by in case I need to move him?
dialog: 
text: She looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from
text: under the shabby overcoat. His hair is on end. He is
text: wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half-smoked
dialog: cigar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: And you are.... his physician?
dialog: Or perhaps a close relative?
text: Phil clears his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Actually, I'm his road manager.
dialog: 
text: The big nurse smiles mirthlessly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: So you're not his physician or a
dialog: close relative?
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Mister Parsons is awaiting a post
dialog: mortem. He will then be
dialog: delivered to his family. I
dialog: suggest you speak to them if you
dialog: wish to pick through his personal
dialog: effects. Sir.
dialog: 
text: She turns away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Now listen here...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: No, you listen here. Mister
text: Parsons is dead and no longer
text: appears to need a road manager.
dialog: Which makes two of us.
dialog: 
text: The nurse turns and marches down the corridor. Phil waits
text: until she's gone and then walks through a door marked
dialog: 'Admittance only to Authorized Hospital Staff'.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL LOCKER ROOM. MORNING
dialog: 
text: Phil slips off his overcoat and stuffs it into the trash.
text: He tosses away the unlit cigar, grabs a white coat from a
text: hook and puts it on. He walks out through another door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING
dialog: 
text: Phil wanders down the corridor, glancing into rooms and
text: checking signs. He pushes open a door marked 'Pathology'.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL PATHOLOGY LAB. MORNING
dialog: 
text: The room is empty, except for a couple of covered bodies on
text: trolleys. Phil checks under the first sheet, and recoils
text: at whatever it is which lies beneath.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sheesh!
dialog: 
text: He walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet. He
text: stares down at the body, visibly moved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello buddy. How you been?
dialog: 
text: He stands for a moment, gripping the gurney and looking
text: down at his friend. Then he snaps out of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I can't stand around here
dialog: chatting with you all day.
dialog: Things to do...
dialog: 
text: He wheels the gurney towards the door.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING
dialog: 
text: Phil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit.
text: A doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a
text: clipboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Naw, I'm cool thanks.
dialog: 
text: The doctor reads the tag on the body's toe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Just taking some stiff down to
dialog: neurology.
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: We don't have a neurology
dialog: department.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Urology.
dialog: 
text: The doctor grabs the end of the gurney. Phil tugs and the
text: doctor tugs back. After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes
text: his head in frustration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Just hold your horses -
dialog: I'll go check the paperwork.
dialog: 
text: The doctor holds up his clipboard.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I have the paperwork.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No. You have your paperwork. I
dialog: need to go check my paperwork.
dialog: 
text: He slips through the exit. The doctor waits awkwardly for
text: a few seconds, and then pushes open the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Hello? Hello...
dialog: 
text: He glances around in surprise, but there is no-one in
dialog: sight.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT. MORNING
text: Phil's trike accelerates as it approaches a T junction. To
text: the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the
text: left 'Los Angeles'. The trike doesn't even slow as it
text: skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying
text: across the road.
dialog: 
text: NB. There will be several shots of Phil driving through
text: the desert, set to music.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PHIL'S STREET. DAY
dialog: 
text: The Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house. Two
text: enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant
text: Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six
text: foot flashing neon star in the front window. Phil gets
text: out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his
dialog: pocket.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: Phil walks into the room and pours himself a drink. He
text: slumps onto the couch, takes a sip and closes his eyes. We
text: see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips
text: through a door and approaches Phil from behind. This is
text: SUSIE, and she puts her hands over his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Guess who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Martin Luther King.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Try again...
text: Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a
text: long slow kiss. She jumps over the couch and resumes
text: kissing, this time more passionately. Phil tries to pull
text: away with little success.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: This.... ...isn't.... ...the
dialog: best time... ...Baby....
dialog: 
text: Susie continues regardless, Phil is now finding it hard to
text: resist. He eventually gives in, and they begin to kiss
text: passionately.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY
dialog: 
text: Phil and Susie are sitting at the kitchen table. He takes
text: a drag from her cigarette and passes it back.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: God damn! I'm so sorry, baby.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah, out of a job again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Would never have happened if you
dialog: were there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: How do you know I wasn't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Well, if you were, you wouldn't
dialog: have let him die.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I was still 'on staff'. He was
dialog: still my responsibility.
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
text: They sit quietly for a moment. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: So where have you been, anyway?
dialog: 
text: She sighs, and stands up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: How long this time? Two weeks?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Yeah, let's have this
dialog: conversation again. Like you
dialog: haven't just done six weeks on
dialog: the road...
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah, but I usually leave a note.
dialog: And there's a paycheck involved.
dialog: 
text: Susie disappears through the door. Phil's shoulders sag
text: and he slumps against the wall. Then Susie reappears with
text: a bottle of Jack Daniels and a couple of glasses. She
text: pours out two generous measures and hands one to Phil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Come here...
dialog: 
text: After a moment, he gets up and follows her out of the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: Susie guides Phil to a chair and sits him down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What's this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: This is a remembrance.
dialog: 
text: She crosses to a record player and turns it on, pausing to
text: let down the blind on the way back. 'In My Hour of
text: Darkness'(or similar music) fills the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SERIES OF
speaker_heading: SHOTS:
dialog: 
text: A) PHIL TAKES A DRINK.
dialog: 
scene_heading: B) GIRL IN TEARS TO CAM OUTSIDE THE JOSHUA TREE MOTEL:

speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (Earnestly)

dialog: feeling. I'll...
speaker_heading: (MOR E)
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
speaker_heading: GIR L (CONT'D)
dialog: never laugh again. My inner joy
text: has gone. It evaporated when
dialog: Gram departed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: C) MUSIC 'EXPERT' ON CHAT SHOW
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXPERT
dialog: He sang country music in a way
dialog: that it had never been sung
dialog: before. It was 'country rock',
dialog: if you like. And it was kinda
text: catchy. At least, the young
dialog: people seemed to lap it up. It's
dialog: fair to say that when Gram
dialog: Parsons died, he died a star.
dialog: 
text: D) PHIL TAKES ANOTHER DRINK. HE MAY BE CRYING.
text: E) HIPPIE TO CAM FROM A STREET IN LA:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIPPIE
dialog: It's like... I can't... It was
dialog: real, kinda... I... Oh, man.
dialog: 
text: F) PHIL SLEEPS, AND THE GLASS SLIPS FROM HIS HAND.
dialog: 
scene_heading: G) REPORTER TO CAM FROM OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REPORTER
text: And another light burns out in
dialog: the desert. Gram Parsons - the
dialog: standard bearer of the new
dialog: country music movement - is dead,
text: following an overdose of drugs.
dialog: While many of America's young
dialog: people are today in mourning,
dialog: their parents will view this as
dialog: another example of how today's
dialog: drug culture can so easily claim
dialog: a life. We'll leave you tonight
text: with the young man's own words.
dialog: Gram Parsons wrote a song called
dialog: 'In My Hour of Darkness', which
dialog: contains these words: 'In my hour
dialog: of darkness...'
dialog: 
text: We are back in Phil's sitting room. Fade up on the music,
text: to match the reporter's words, as Gram's voice fills the
dialog: room: (or similar music).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM'S VOICE
dialog: In my hour of darkness, in my
dialog: time of need, Oh Lord grant me
dialog: vision, Oh Lord grant me speed.
dialog: Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord
dialog: grant me speed.
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
text: Susie tenderly throws a blanket over the sleeping Phil as
text: the record ends. She turns the light off and the room goes
dialog: dark.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: Susie walks in with a coffee. She sits beside Phil and
text: strokes his head until he wakes. She kisses him and passes
text: him the cup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Hello.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Hi.
text: He sits up and stretches. She leans over to kiss him, then
text: stands and starts to tidy. He watches her. She picks up
text: some clothing from near his chair and moves away. He drops
text: another piece of clothing on the same spot. She says
text: nothing and picks it up. He takes a sock off and drops it.
dialog: It has stopped being a game and started being a statement.
text: She picks the sock up and drops it in his lap. He pushes
text: it back onto the floor. She opens her arms and everything
text: falls to the floor. She walks out of the room and into the
text: kitchen. He follows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY
dialog: 
text: Susie leans on the table, staring out of the window. Phil
text: walks up behind her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: When you're here, I spend my time
dialog: wondering when you're going. And
dialog: when you're back, I wonder where
dialog: you've been.
dialog: 
text: She turns and walks round to face him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Phil, you give me laughs and a
dialog: great time. But I'm not sure if
dialog: that's enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You mean there's more than that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Yes, there's more than that!
dialog: There's dependable, responsible,
dialog: reliable...
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: There's dull, boring, normal.
dialog: You should hook up with someone
dialog: who works in a bank. I know a
dialog: guy, actually. He has fish for
dialog: dinner every Friday, cleans his
dialog: shoes twice a week and buys his
dialog: ties in bulk because it works out
dialog: cheaper that way. I'll put you
dialog: in touch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I don't mind loving a crazy
dialog: bastard, Phil. But you've got to
dialog: be for something and not just
dialog: against everything. You have to
dialog: choose something to represent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I represent the combined forces
dialog: of charm, enchantment and
dialog: exuberance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Your job is to arrange other
dialog: people's lives. Maybe it's time
dialog: to put a little thought into your
dialog: own.
dialog: 
text: Susie walks out of the room.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET. DAY
dialog: 
text: A suburban street of small, neat bungalows. We move down
text: the street, past house and identical house, until we rest
text: outside another that is identical to the rest. The front
text: door opens, and a nondescript man emerges, carrying a small
text: overnight bag. He carefully locks the door and walks down
text: the path to where a cab waits. We can clearly see 'New
text: Orleans Taxi' marked on the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Airport, please.
dialog: 
text: This is STANLEY PARSONS, Gram's father.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY
dialog: 
text: There is a loud banging on the front door. Phil glances
text: out of the window, and looks momentarily puzzled. He opens
text: the door, and a beautiful woman stands on the step.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Long time, no see, Barbara.
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Don't try and schmooze me,
dialog: Kaufman, you repellent slimeball.
dialog: 
text: She notices Susie standing behind Phil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: The latest victim?
dialog: 
text: Barbara walks past them into the kitchen. Susie looks
text: quizzically at Phil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Meet Barbara.
dialog: 
text: Barbara calls out from the kitchen.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It's a lot tidier than I
dialog: remember.
dialog: 
text: Susie raises an eyebrow at Phil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Who the hell is she?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Gram's ex-girlfriend.
dialog: 
text: Phil points at his temple as if to say she's nuts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Girlfriend? Isn't he married?
dialog: 
text: Barbara walks back into the hall.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Welcome to the seventies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What do you want, Barbara?
dialog: 
text: Barbara lights a cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I'm here to fulfill Gram's
dialog: wishes.
dialog: 
text: She waits for him to speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That's nice. I have no idea what
dialog: you're talking about.
dialog: 
text: She holds up an old piece of writing paper.
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (2)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Do you know what this is?
dialog: 
text: Phil reaches for it, but Barbara snatches it away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's Gram's will.
dialog: 
text: She reads it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: To whom it may concern: I would
dialog: like it to be known that it is my
dialog: wish to leave Barbara Mansfield
dialog: my assets and belongings in the
dialog: event of my death. Signed:
dialog: Ingram Cecil Parsons.
dialog: 
text: Phil looks surprised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Did he write that with joined up
dialog: writing or was it before he knew
dialog: how?
dialog: 
text: Barbara gives a wry smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Still the jester Kaufman, and
text: still very unfunny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That's not a will Barbara, and
dialog: you know it.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It's better than a will,
dialog: actually. It's a signed promise
dialog: from Gram to leave me all his
dialog: assets and belongings. And
dialog: anyway, it's really none of your
dialog: business what this is. I've come
dialog: for the guitar.
dialog: 
text: Phil shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Guitar?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Yes. Gram's guitar. He always
dialog: kept it here.

dialog: 
text: Barbara leans forward until their noses are almost
dialog: touching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I don't believe you, Kaufman.
dialog: 
text: Barbara pushes past Phil who gives no resistance. She
text: walks straight over to the couch and starts pulling up the
text: cushions. Susie moves to stop her, but Phil holds her back
text: and lets Barbara carry on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S LOUNGE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Phil and Susie sit on the sofa, an island of calm in a sea
text: of chaos. Around them, the floor is covered with papers,
text: clothing, empty record covers, torn open cushions and
text: books. A broken drawer is propped against the table. A
text: lampshade hangs crazily from its bearings, throwing strange
text: shadows around the room. Suddenly, Susie gets up and kicks
text: a cushion across the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Hey, well done. You found the
text: only unbroken thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Why did you let her in?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It's all part of the grieving
dialog: process.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: How can she behave that way?
dialog: Gram's not even in the ground
dialog: yet.
dialog: 
text: Phil stares at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Nothing.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Don't you freak out on me.

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Do me a favor and get the guitar,

scene_heading: INT. JOSHUA TREE FUNERAL HOME. DAY
dialog: 
text: We hear the rest of Phil's mutter from the phone in the
text: undertaker's hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNDERTAKER
dialog: It's Latin. It means burial. Is
dialog: there anything I can help with?
dialog: Who am I speaking to?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY
dialog: 
text: Phil straightens up. He speaks curtly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yes, you can help me as a matter

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JOSHUA TREE FUNERAL HOME. DAY
dialog: 
text: Again, we hear Phil's voice trumpeting out of the phone.
text: The undertaker changes his tone.

speaker_heading: UNDERTAKER
dialog: Mister Parsons? I'm sorry, I'll
dialog: take a look immediately.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
text: He puts down the phone and flicks through a big book. He
text: purses his lips. He wipes his nose with a white silk
text: handkerchief. Then he picks up the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNDERTAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, he was here.
dialog: 
dialog: Mutter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNDERTAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: New Orleans. Although he only
dialog: just went, so he'll still be on
text: his way to Los Angeles Airport.
dialog: Big thrill for us here, as we're
text: only a small facility. Nearly
dialog: got Jane Mansfield in '67 when
dialog: she passed through, but she got
dialog: diverted to Frisco. Hello?
dialog: 
dialog: No mutter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNDERTAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello. Hellooo...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY
dialog: 
text: The phone sits on the table but the room is empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
speaker_heading: (O.S)
dialog: Phil?
dialog: 
text: Susie walks in, looks around, and leaves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PHIL'S DRIVEWAY. DAY
text: Phil is lying down in the back of Susie's station wagon,
text: his feet sticking out of the back. Susie comes out of the
text: house carrying the guitar, and sits on the steps, where she
text: watches him. After a minute:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: These things aren't that big.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Okay. Is that a problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Not really.
dialog: 
text: Susie is confused.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Well, that's good.
dialog: 
text: No answer. Phil continues to check out the inside of her
dialog: car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: So what are you up to?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It's best you don't know.
dialog: 
text: Without a word, Susie gets up and walks into the house.
text: Phil lies still. After a moment, she reappears with her
text: bag. She flounces theatrically past him and opens the car
text: door. Phil gets out of the back.
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I don't know what this madness
dialog: is, but I'm not getting involved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, that's the point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I mean, I don't know what it is
dialog: you're planning, but I'm not
dialog: bailing you out again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I'm going.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Again.
dialog: 
text: She gets into the car and slams the door. She starts the
text: engine, and Phil stands back, but the car doesn't move.
text: After a moment the window winds down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: This time, I'm not coming back.
dialog: 
text: She gives him a 'so there' smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to find a man who buys

dialog: 
text: She drives away.

scene_heading: EXT. LARRY OSTERBERG'S HOME. DAY
dialog: 
text: Phil arrives on his trike outside a small house.
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LARRY OSTERBERG'S HOME. DAY
dialog: 
text: A man is sitting cross-legged on the floor. A joss stick
text: burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background.
text: This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating. There is a
text: loud hammering on the door. Larry shows no sign of having
text: heard anything. More hammering at the door, but still no
text: response. Then the letter box creaks open and an eye
text: appears in the slot. After a moment, the eye disappears
text: and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window. The
text: window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face
text: appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (O.S)
dialog: Hello? Anyone there?
text: Then Phil is gone. Larry expels a big breath. The
text: letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (O.S)
dialog: There you are. I'm looking for
dialog: Larry Osterberg.
dialog: 
text: Larry sighs, and stretches. He gets up slowly, gently
text: shakes himself to relax his muscles and walks to the door,
text: which he opens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: The door is unlocked.
dialog: 
text: Phil barrels in and closes the door behind him. He turns
text: to take a look around the room.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You Larry Osterberg?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yes. Welcome to my house.
dialog: 
text: This might be sarcastic, but any nuance is lost on Phil,
text: who props the guitar up against the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Very nice. What's that noise?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: Manomanjari on the sitar by
dialog: Nikhil Banerjee.
dialog: (NB. Similar music may
dialog: be used in this scene)
text: Phil stares at him.
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: He pops a cigar into his mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: There's no smoking in here, I'm
dialog: afraid.
dialog: 
text: Phil stares meaningfully at the burning joss stick, but
text: puts the cigar away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Who are you, please?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh, I'm Phil Kaufman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: And how may I help you, Phil
dialog: Kaufman?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I'd like to hire your car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, I need to pick someone up
text: at the airport.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Don't you know anyone with a car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yes, of course. It's just that
dialog: I'm told your car is more
dialog: suitable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I see. In what way is my car
dialog: more suitable?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well... it's a hearse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: They both look at each other. Larry waits for Phil to
dialog: speak.
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (2)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: And how is a hearse going to be
dialog: suitable for picking someone up
dialog: from the airport?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It's... a joke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: A joke?
dialog: 
text: He doesn't look entirely convinced.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: A prank. A surprise.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well, okay. Is it two hundred
dialog: dollars worth of surprise?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No, it's more of a fifty dollar
dialog: surprise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I can lend you a bicycle.
text: Besides, the car is booked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Booked how?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I use it to carry equipment for a
dialog: band.
text: Phil pulls some cash out of his pocket and sorts through
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, here's two hundred dollars
dialog: to unbook it. Let 'em carry
text: their own trombones.
dialog: 
text: Phil passes the money over. Larry starts to count it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't need to count it. You
dialog: could trust me.
dialog: 
text: Larry doesn't pause counting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Let's see; I've never met you in
dialog: my life, you shout through my
dialog: mail slot, you want to hire my
dialog: hearse as a joke, and...
speaker_heading: (MOR E)
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (3)
speaker_heading: LAR RY (CONT'D)
dialog: you're twenty dollars short. Why
dialog: should I trust you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That last twenty is for gas.
dialog: Anyway - I haven't even seen the
dialog: car yet. I'm the one who's
dialog: operating on trust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: It's a hearse. What else do you
dialog: need to know?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE LARRY OSTERBERG'S GARAGE. DAY
dialog: 
text: The garage doors swing open and a hearse drives out into
text: the sun. It is bright yellow and covered in painted
text: flowers. One of the side windows is broken and a headlight
text: hangs out. Phil's jaw drops open. Larry gets out of the
text: driving seat and pats the roof, proudly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Meet Bernice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Bernice?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Bernice is a Cadillac Superior
dialog: Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral
dialog: Coach. We've got a Seven gallon
dialog: V8 engine offering three hundred
dialog: and forty bhp at four thousand
dialog: six hundred revolutions per
dialog: minute. You're looking at a
dialog: twenty one feet beauty with a one
dialog: hundred and fifty six inch
text: wheelbase containing a four
dialog: barrel Rochester Quadrajet
dialog: carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic
dialog: transmission. Bernice weighs
text: over six thousand pounds.
dialog: 
text: There is a very long silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: It's yellow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yes, it's yellow. Bernice comes
dialog: in yellow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It's supposed to be black.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: But they're all black.
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That might be my point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: So how is a yellow hearse covered
dialog: with flowers less of a surprise
dialog: than a black hearse?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I paid you two hundred dollars
text: for a black hearse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: No, you paid me a hundred and
dialog: eighty dollars for a hearse, and
dialog: a hearse is what you've got. If
dialog: you take a long, hard look at
dialog: Bernice, you'll see that she's
dialog: one of a kind. She's big, she's
dialog: fast, she's comfortable, and
dialog: she's beautiful. But she's not
dialog: black.
dialog: 
text: They stare at each other for a moment. Then Phil sighs
dialog: deeply.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Okay. Where are the keys?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I gotta go.
text: Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Oh, no. She doesn't go anywhere
dialog: without me.
dialog: 
text: Phil thinks this over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Okay. Well, let's boogie.
dialog: 
text: Larry runs across and closes the doors on a pile of amps
text: and band equipment that now sits in the garage. Phil puts
text: the guitar in the back seat and they get into the car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Larry pulls a screwdriver out of the glove compartment and
text: jigs it about in the ignition until the engine catches.
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
text: Then he turns the keys and pull up and down to undo the
text: steering lock. Phil watches curiously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Someone stole her last summer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, I've paid top dollar, so
dialog: it's nice to see I'm getting the
dialog: best...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: How did you hear of Bernice and
dialog: me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You are famous throughout the
dialog: greater Los Angeles area.
dialog: 
text: Larry looks pleased.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: But you are the only guy with a
dialog: hearse. Don't go getting carried
dialog: away...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LA HIGHWAY. DAY
dialog: 
text: One backfire, and Bernice is ready. The hearse weaves
text: erratically across the road and then disappears in a cloud
text: of exhaust smoke.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BARBARA'S HOME. EVENING
dialog: 
text: Barbara sits at a table in her shabby kitchen, reading the
text: will. She lights a cigarette and sits back in her chair.
scene_heading: EXT. LAX. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The hearse drives under a huge sign which reads 'Welcome to
text: Los Angeles Airport' and peels off the main road past some
text: offices and cargo stores. Bernice drives into a giant
text: hangar and pulls up outside a dark and shuttered office.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. EVENING
dialog: 
text: Phil glances out of the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Pull over.
dialog: 
text: Larry parks, and Phil looks at his watch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What's the matter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well... What flight are they on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: We'll wait here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay. Well, what time is the
dialog: flight due?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Soon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay. How soon?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Why do you ask so many damn
dialog: questions?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well... I don't know.
dialog: 
text: There is silence. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shouldn't we be at arrivals?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Look, will you please shut up
dialog: asking me stuff?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: He looks out of the window, and then back at Phil, who now
text: has his eyes closed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: So how long are we going to wait?
dialog: 
text: Phil doesn't answer for a moment. Just as Larry opens his
text: mouth to ask again, Phil speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Morning.
dialog: 
text: Larry looks at Phil with astonishment.
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (2)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Morning? What do you mean,
dialog: morning?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: We'll make the pick-up in the
dialog: morning.
dialog: 
text: Larry tries to start the car. Phil leans over and plucks
text: the screwdriver from his hand. He reclines his seat and
text: closes his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You wait till morning. I'm going
dialog: home.
text: Larry opens the door and gets out of the car. He slams the
text: door shut behind him and stomps off into the gloom. Phil
text: doesn't move.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. EVENING - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: The drivers' door opens and Larry gets back into the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm only back because I don't
dialog: trust you with Bernice. I don't
dialog: even know you, and if you think
dialog: I'm going to leave my car with
dialog: you and just walk away, then
dialog: you've got another thought on the
dialog: way.
dialog: 
text: He stares at Phil, who hasn't moved an inch: eyes still
text: closed, unlit cigar hanging out of the corner of his mouth,
text: feet up on the dash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm staying right here. Where I
dialog: can keep an eye on things...
dialog: 
text: There is still no response from Phil. After a moment,
text: Larry settles back in his seat and closes his eyes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The hearse disappears into the gloom as the light fades and
text: night falls.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE BARBARA'S HOME. MORNING
dialog: 
text: A door swings open, and Barbara appears. She is looking
text: quite stunning, with a tight black suit doing equal justice
text: to her womanly curves and her duties as a mourner. She
text: strides down the sidewalk, and as a group of schoolchildren
text: appears around the corner Barbara scatters left and right.
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
text: Then she cuts across the road, and a delivery van skids to
text: a halt inches away, horn blaring. The driver leans out of
text: the window, furious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Hey, lady!
dialog: 
text: Barbara stops and whips round, her hair cascading across
text: her shoulders, her blue eyes flashing. The man simply
text: stares at her, enchanted by her beauty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
text: He continues to stare, and is only shaken back to his
text: senses by a burst of abuse from further back in the road.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: You... should be careful.
dialog: 
text: Barbara smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Why, thank you...

speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I've come to pick up my son's

dialog: 
text: The line behind him falls quiet, and the officious clerk
text: wobbles slightly. Stanley raises his voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: My son died out here, you see?
dialog: So I've come to bring him home.
text: Everyone looks at Stanley. Stanley looks at the clerk.

speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT'D)

scene_heading: CHECK-IN CLERK
dialog: Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. We'll...

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BANK. MORNING
dialog: 
text: There is a line leading to the information desk, but

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I'd like to see the manager,
dialog: please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Wait your turn.
dialog: 
text: Barbara's eyes immediately water, and her lower lip
text: trembles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I'm sorry. It's just that the
dialog: man I loved died yesterday. I
dialog: was forgetting my manners...
dialog: 
text: She dabs at her eyes with a lace handkerchief. The

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: I'm sorry. Please... go ahead.

speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:

scene_heading: EXT. MORTUARY. MORNING
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. MORNING
text: Phil walks over to the door and walks inside the mortuary.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MORTUARY. MORNING
dialog: 
text: The clerk busies himself opening up. Phil wanders around
text: and knocks into a coffin. The lid bangs closed and the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I'm here to pick up a... coffin.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: No you're not.

speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: I simply can't give you any money
dialog: based on this piece of paper.
dialog: 
text: Barbara is totally calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It's not a piece of paper. It's
dialog: a promise from Gram to leave me
dialog: all his money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Well, I'm sorry, but it's highly
dialog: likely that the estate will go to
dialog: probate and be divided up
dialog: accordingly, subject to a valid

speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:

dialog: cry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: You don't seem to understand.

speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: No... I do... understand, Miss

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Please tell me how I'm supposed

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Are you saying that I'm lying?
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: No, absolutely not. But getting

text: Stanley doesn't move. He peers at Stanley and shuffles in
text: his seat, but there is still no reaction. Next, a deep
text: sigh is forced out between his fat wet lips - he is plainly
text: keen to start a conversation. Stanley keeps looking out of

speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Well, you'd better tell them that

scene_heading: INT. MORTUARY. MORNING
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PJ GAMBRELL
dialog: What's your bidness?

scene_heading: INT. PLANE - LAX. MORNING
dialog:

text: blanket on the back. It is driving away from the plane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What the hell?
dialog: 
text: He stands up and turns to the fat man.

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What's the hurry?
dialog:

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: CLERK

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: When you came in, you said you

dialog:

speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Use your phone?
dialog: 
text: After a moment, the clerk nods towards the phone on the

speaker_heading: CLERK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: In a hearse?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yes. It's a... surprise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Which parts the surprise: The
dialog: fact that you're in a bright
dialog: yellow hearse, the fact that
dialog: you're dressed like something out
dialog: of a horror film, or the fact
dialog: that you're half a mile from the

speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well... the first part.
dialog:

speaker_heading: COP

speaker_heading: COP (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, now why don't you tell me
dialog: what the hell's going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Going on?
text: They stare at each other. The cop shifts position and
text: purses his lips. Larry stares at the ground looking for
text: some kind of inspiration. Just when the silence moves
text: beyond uncomfortable, the door of the mortuary opens and
text: Phil clatters out with the casket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, I don't care if it is first
dialog: thing in the morning - but I sure
dialog: need a coffee. I tell you, I've
dialog: never seen so many darned bits of
dialog: paper to sign! It's paperwork
dialog: which is slowing this great

dialog: triplicate!
dialog: 
text: He's busying himself at the back of the hearse, and appears
text: to notice the cop for the first time.
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Good morning officer.
dialog: 
text: The cop peers at him suspiciously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Mornin'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I was just saying how people with
dialog: work to do - people like
dialog: yourself, officer - are just
text: getting engulfed by paper. Grab
dialog: the end, will you? Doesn't that
dialog: just drive you plain crazy?
dialog: 
text: The cop hesitates and then takes the end of the casket and
text: helps load it into the hearse.
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (2)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: I guess it does.
dialog: 
text: Phil gestures at Larry to get into the car, which he does.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: One casket, six sheets to sign.
dialog: Six! That can't be right. Does
dialog: that sound right to you?
dialog: 
text: He closes the back doors and gets into the passenger seat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Nope. Sure don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: And the very last thing I want to
dialog: do is to hold you up further with
dialog: my chatter. Thank you for your

dialog: 
dialog: It looks like they've got away with it. But:

speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Just a moment, boys.
dialog: 
text: Phil smiles up at him.

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yessir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Your sidekick here has just

speaker_heading: COP

dialog: That's a real nice touch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah. We're doing it this way
dialog: for the avoidance of doubt.
dialog: 
text: He gestures at Larry to start the car. Larry pulls out the
text: screwdriver and starts to jig it about in the ignition.
text: The cop watches. As the engine refuses to catch, Larry
text: starts to panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Ignition's a bit temperamental.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Right.
dialog: 
text: More fiddling. No ignition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Have to use a screwdriver.

speaker_heading: COP
dialog: I see that.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Thanks for everything, officer.
dialog: We'd best be off...
dialog:

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: LARRY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What seems like Yin is often
dialog: supported by Yang, and vice

dialog: example: To truly know good, you
dialog: must first know evil, and without
dialog: good as a comparison, nothing can
dialog: be evil. So by allowing Yin to
dialog: flourish, you welcome Yan. By
dialog: letting go of Yin, you are

dialog: example is...
dialog: 
text: There is a crash, and the car slams to a halt. Larry is

dialog: 
text: Phil starts to laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That's a great line...
text: The cop turns to Phil. He is still smiling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: A long pause. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP (CONT'D)
dialog: I wonder if you gentlemen can
dialog: help me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
dialog: I'm looking for some fellows who
dialog: stole a body back there at the
dialog: airport.
text: Larry wobbles with shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: A body? Stole a body?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
text: A body. Rather like the one in
dialog: the back of your car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: That's an empty coffin, officer.
dialog: 
text: The cop ignores him. Phil lights his cigar.
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (3)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
dialog: I know it sounds strange. But
dialog: these guys - there are two of
dialog: them - they stole a body, loaded
text: it into the back of an old yellow
text: hearse painted with flowers, and
dialog: they're supposed to be driving
dialog: out this way.
dialog: 
text: Larry thinks hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: Hearse. Flowers.
dialog: 
text: He looks to Phil for support. Phil raises an eyebrow.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I think he's onto us, Larry.
dialog: He's just having a little fun at
dialog: our expense.
dialog: 
text: The cop is no longer smiling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
dialog: In the car, please.
dialog: 
text: Phil opens the door and empty beer bottles cascade out into
text: the road. They get into the car and the cop cuffs them
text: together through the steering wheel and takes the car keys.
text: Then he walks back over to his bike and starts to talk into
dialog: the radio.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Phil closes his eyes and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: God damn!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: He said a body. He said we stole
text: a body.
dialog: 
text: Phil opens his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: He meant a coffin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: He didn't say 'coffin'. He said
dialog: 'body'. Tell me we haven't
dialog: stolen a real person.
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Look, the place that I get the

dialog: Trust me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Oh, I'm just overflowing with
dialog: trust for you, man. I feel this
dialog: overwhelming feeling of... trust
dialog: every time I look at you.
dialog: 
text: He shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna check inside that box
dialog: just as soon as we're out of

dialog: 
text: They both stare out of the window. Phil bangs the cuffs
text: against the wheel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Jesus!
dialog: 
text: They sit glowering out of different windows at different
text: bits of desert. The motorcycle cop can be heard talking
text: into his radio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What are we going to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Time.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: We're going to be arrested,
dialog: that's what we're going to do.
dialog: Then we'll go to court and then
dialog: we'll go to jail and we'll do
dialog: that for a while.
dialog: 
text: Larry mulls this over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What about if I could slip out of
dialog: these cuffs?
dialog: 
text: Phil treats the theoretical question with indifference.
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (2)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah, that would be great. Then
dialog: we could suspend you from a
text: bridge in a straitjacket and set
text: the rope on fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: No, really. I really can slip
dialog: these cuffs.
dialog: 
text: He has Phil's attention now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Okay. Show me.
dialog: 
text: Larry pops his middle finger out of its socket, squeezes
text: his hand and slides it out of the handcuff. He hands the
text: other cuff to Phil, who stares at him in astonishment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Do you think we should go?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yes, I think we should go.
dialog: 
text: Larry starts the car. He throws it into reverse and the
text: bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost. Suddenly
text: the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into the
text: cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its
text: trailing wire. Larry slams on the brakes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Oh shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Nicely done.
dialog: 
text: He rolls down his window and addresses the cop, who is
text: staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll be moving on, now that your
text: sign no longer appears to be
dialog: impeding our forward progress.
dialog: 
text: Bernice accelerates away but slowly starts to turn in a
text: wide ark and circles the smashed bike. The cop chases
dialog: them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Phil screams at Larry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: LARRY

dialog: 
text: Phil turns to watch the chasing policeman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: So, we've escaped but we can only
dialog: drive in a circle?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT. DAY
dialog: 
text: They do another circuit. The exhausted cop stops,
text: breathing heavily, and then watches in astonishment as the
text: hearse turns and heads back towards him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Phil and Larry stare at the policeman out of the window as
text: the car sweeps past. The cop gets his gun out of his
text: holster, and Phil reaches into the glove box and pulls out
text: the screwdriver. He leans across Larry, jams it into the
text: wheel column, and snaps the steering lock in two. The
text: hearse's direction immediately changes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Can we please go?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT. DAY

speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: If you hate Phil so much, why are
dialog: you chasing him across

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: He's got Gram and I need him.

dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE

text: Barbara shoots her a withering look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I know he's dead, Honey. But he
dialog: hasn't been officially
dialog: identified, and there's no

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Let's just say I'm overly

speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: This is all about money, isn't

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Isn't everything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I was a great support to Gram

speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Phil's not responsible for your

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: What do you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I know that he can be a pain in

dialog: Gram, Phil only ever did the
dialog: right thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: In his whole life, Phil Kaufman
dialog: didn't do anything because it was

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I don't have to listen to this.
dialog: 
text: Susie leans over, grabs the safety brake and pulls it up
text: hard. The car swerves and skids to a stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, you vindictive bitch. I'm
dialog: going with you to Joshua Tree
dialog: because my life seems to have

scene_heading: INT. HEARSE. DAY - LATER
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well, that's it! They're going

speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Jesus - what the hell is that?
dialog: 
text: A large plaster dinosaur appears ahead.

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: PHIL

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. POLYONAX PLACE. DAY
dialog: 
text: The hearse pulls up around the back of the building, and

text: peer round the side of the building to check that they have

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD. DAY
dialog: 
text: A Police Car with siren blaring and lights flashing speeds

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - THE POLYONAX PLACE. DAY
dialog: 
text: We are with a short-order cook. He expertly flips a burger
text: from a hotplate and adds it to a plate overflowing with

text: on which there is a second plate containing two pieces of
text: plain bread and some lettuce. He dings a bell and a waiter
text: enters and picks up the tray. We move with the tray as he
text: carries it from the kitchen and into the dining area. He
text: stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer and
text: a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to Phil and
text: Larry, who are sitting in a window booth. Larry has his

dialog: You frighten him.

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I do not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE POLYONAX PLACE. DAY

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey man, where's the phone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARMAN

speaker_heading: STANLEY

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I do okay. Listen, I was an

dialog: because it puts food on my table,

dialog: myself, no-one else will.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: So what do you want from us?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I don't want anything from you.
dialog: It would be a bonus to see

speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Why do you hate Phil so much?

text: Barbara lights another cigarette.

speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Gram was the first good guy I

dialog: perfect, but it worked between
dialog: us. We just seemed to fit
dialog: together. But Gram was already
dialog: wild, and I made him wilder.
text: Kaufman watched over him like a

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That's what I hate about people

dialog: boundaries, provisos. You only
dialog: operate with a safety net.
dialog: 
text: Larry is confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Tell me something - if it was the

dialog: 
text: Phil says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You've missed the point. See, it
dialog: doesn't matter what he would do,
dialog: or what you and your tie-dyed
dialog: friends think is the correct way
dialog: to behave. To me, it only
dialog: matters what I do. Where you
dialog: have boundaries and limits and

dialog: I keep it - that's right. If I
dialog: break that promise - that's

dialog: 
text: Phil rubs his eyes, tired. Suddenly, Larry smashes Phil

text: Then Susie walks over to the hearse's passenger window and

speaker_heading: PHIL
text: It's too late to claim him now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What the hell does that mean?
dialog: 
text: They are almost nose-to-nose now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: It means that you were never
dialog: there when it mattered to Gram.
dialog: It means that you stopped being a

dialog: doing your bidding. It means
dialog: that you learned to care too
dialog: late. That's what it means.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I don't have to justify my

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (2)
speaker_heading: STA NLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: He was a disappointment to me,

text: but he let it trickle away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No - he gave it his all, but in a
dialog: way you could never understand.
dialog: And all he ever wanted from you
dialog: was approval. He wanted you to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I kept everything. Every record,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I was both, yes.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: And that you weren't there when

dialog: 
dialog: A beat, then:

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yes. That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: So the guilt isn't all mine,

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: You boys took away my son. I

speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: Waves a hand at Stanley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: And you are an old fool who

dialog: 
text: She walks over to the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, let's just call the cops and
dialog: get it done. The sooner we get

dialog:

text: into the bathroom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! What the hell are you

dialog: 
text: He emerges and slips the back of a chair under the handle,

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Son, you had your chance to look

dialog: 
text: There is a 'bang' from the bathroom, and the door shakes.

speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (4)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
speaker_heading: (O.S)
dialog: Bastard!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL

dialog: 
text: Stanley pauses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Okay. You tell me why I should
dialog: let you take my boy.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I was his road manager and his
dialog: friend. We loved it out here in
dialog: the desert, and we made a pact
dialog: that whoever died first, the
dialog: other would come down here and
dialog: set them free. Gram gave his
dialog: word and I gave mine.
dialog: 
text: Stanley thinks about this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: You're a couple of druggies. Why
dialog: should I believe you?
dialog: 
dialog: Phil doesn't like the inference.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I don't take drugs.
text: Another 'bang' from the bathroom. Stanley turns to Larry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What about you? Are you a

dialog: 
text: There is a long pause. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yes. Yes I am.
dialog:

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Are you going to call them?
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Well, you haven't given me a

dialog: 
text: There is another 'crash' from inside the bathroom. The

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: There isn't a reason. If someone

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What is it, son?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I've been a junkie for over four

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: You don't need...

text: Larry holds his hand up to stop Stanley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I've taken heroin, speed, uppers,

dialog: methadone, mushrooms, quaaludes,
dialog: acid, valium, barbiturates,
dialog: straight LSD, marijuana,
dialog: marijuana laced with opium,
dialog: nembutal, mescalin of course, and

speaker_heading: STANLEY

dialog: That's very impressive, son.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Not my point.

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Better make the point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I started working my way through

speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (2)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Are we sure that this is helping?
dialog: 
text: Larry ignores him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: And now I've stopped. I stopped
dialog: because it seems that I had
dialog: something more important to do.
dialog: 
text: They all look at him. He gestures at Phil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: He's doing this because he gave
dialog: his word. I'm prepared to do
dialog: this now because I think it's
dialog: right. And because I believe
dialog: that each body has a soul. And
dialog: Gram's soul doesn't belong in a
text: family plot surrounded by
dialog: strangers. It belongs here,
dialog: where he was happiest.
dialog: 
text: In the silence, Susie walks over and grips Phil's hand.
text: Then Stanley gets up off the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I'm going to go say goodbye to my
dialog: son.
dialog: 
text: Everyone looks surprised. Phil gives Larry a look of
text: appreciative approval. Barbara starts to kick furiously at

text: go, and Susie walks over to kiss Phil.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What's that for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: That's for failing to reinforce

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: C'mon, time to go...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE ROOM 8. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Phil, Larry and Susie leave room eight. They look around

speaker_heading: PHIL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Yeah, he took the body and

dialog: I've just told you that they've
dialog: stolen a body and you want to see

dialog: 
text: He just stares at her. Barbara is losing it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: You people are supposed to be on
text: the lookout for a hearse. A
dialog: hearse is a big long car. You
dialog: can usually tell which ones are
dialog: the hearses, because they have
text: coffins in the back. The one
dialog: we're looking for is painted
dialog: yellow. Does this look like a
dialog: yellow hearse to you, asshole?
dialog: 
text: Long pause. Barbara realizes that she might have gone too
text: far. He starts to write a ticket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that a ticket? Are you
dialog: writing me a ticket?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Yes it is, ma'am. And yes I am.

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Cap Rock. This is perfect.
dialog: Really peaceful...
dialog: 
text: Larry pulls the hearse over near the rock. They all sit
text: there for a moment. Phil and Larry look at each other.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Phil opens the back of the hearse and slides the casket out
text: of the car. He notices that Larry has made no move to
text: help. Susie sits on a rock and watches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You wanna give me a hand here?
text: Larry walks over and grabs the other end of the casket.
text: They walk it away from the car and lay it down. As they
text: lower it, the coffin slips out of Phil's hands and bangs
text: down in the sand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, Gram.
dialog: 
text: They stand and stare at the casket. Susie walks over with
text: the guitar and takes Phil's hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Now we... do it.
dialog: 
text: He gets the gasoline can from the car and stands over the
text: casket.
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Take the top off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: Flesh burns easier than wood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I can't believe you just said
dialog: that. I'm not taking the top
dialog: off.
dialog: 
text: He walks off. Phil puts the can down and removes the top
text: of the casket. He peers inside.
dialog: 
dialog: 95.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (to Gram)
dialog: Hey, man. Looking a little
dialog: peaky...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Some decorum would be nice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Right.
dialog: 
text: He pours some gasoline into the casket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think that's enough?
text: Against his better judgment, Larry walks over and peers
dialog: inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well, I don't know. Maybe a
dialog: little more.
dialog: 
text: Phil pours a little more fuel in. He looks over at Susie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Enough?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: I'm not having a conversation
dialog: with you about how much gasoline
dialog: you need to burn a body.
dialog: 
text: She backs off.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I think that'll do it.
dialog: 
text: Phil stops pouring and shakes the can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: Only a little left.
dialog: 
text: He pours the rest of the can into the casket. Susie walks
text: over to stand next to Phil. He looks down at Gram.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry I wasn't there for you
dialog: when it mattered, but I was there
dialog: before, and I've been there ever
dialog: since. Gram, good luck to you,
dialog: wherever you are.
dialog: 
text: They all stare at the casket. Phil wipes a tear away and
text: tucks a can of beer into the coffin.

dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (2)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: That's my last one, man.
dialog: 
text: He rests Gram's guitar against the casket, takes big puffs
text: on his cigar to get the flame up, then tosses it into the
text: coffin. They wait. Nothing happens. Phil edges nearer
text: and looks inside. Then the coffin explodes into flames.
text: All three of them are thrown backwards by the blast.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The traffic cop is finishing the ticket when there is a

speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Jesus! What the hell's that?
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: That'll be Gram Parsons, on fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Get in the car, ma'am. Now.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Phil, Larry and Susie pick themselves up. They stare at
text: the pyre. Phil is close to tears, and Susie puts her arm
text: around him. For a moment, Phil thinks he sees the flames
text: morph into the shape of an angel over the burning coffin.
text: The image disappears when Larry speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Maybe too much fuel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Nah, I just didn't factor in the
text: booze inside of him. Gram
dialog: always...
dialog: 
text: He breaks off as a flashing police light appears in the
text: darkness, followed by a siren.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT'D)
dialog: I think our work here is done.
dialog: 
text: Larry and Susie run to the car. Phil lingers a moment,

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Phil jumps into the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Go!

scene_heading: INT. CAR. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Stanley watches as the hearse flies past him. He glances

dialog: the darkness.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The police car arrives at the scene. Barbara and the cop

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: How do you know it's your
dialog: boyfriend?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: I recognize that birthmark on his

dialog: observation?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Be my guest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
text: We're in the desert. It is dark.
dialog: If you want to catch someone in
dialog: the dark, it's best not to turn

text: loud noise with a siren.
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: Do you want to know what I think,
dialog: ma'am?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: No. But I'm really, really keen
dialog: to find out.
dialog: 
text: The traffic cop stares into the fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAFFIC COP
dialog: I think it was suicide. He just
dialog: wanted to get away from you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE. DAWN
dialog: 
text: Phil is fast asleep and snoring in Bernice's passenger
text: seat. He wakes slowly and shields his eyes from the bright
text: sunshine that pours through the windscreen. He pulls a
text: flask out of the glove compartment and takes a long gargle,
text: spitting the result out of the window.
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D:
text: Then he glances in the rear view mirror and sees the man
text: sitting in the casket bay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: Sure is hot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Hello, Gram.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: Phil.
dialog: 
text: Gram pulls himself along the bay and onto the back seat.
text: He then climbs into the front, settles next to Phil and
text: holds his hand out for the flask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Do you think you should?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: Not gonna hurt me now, is it?
dialog: 
text: He takes a drink and looks around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice wheels. Very stylish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: They're very handy for
dialog: transporting dead people around.
dialog: Nothing better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: I am dead, then?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You're more than dead, Gram. You
text: and the box are down to bones and
dialog: brass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: Oh, well. Here's mud in your
dialog: eye.
dialog: 
text: He takes another drink and hands the flask back to Phil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What can I do for you, Gram?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: You assume I want something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, you're here. And seeing as
dialog: I just burned you to a cinder,
dialog: you shouldn't be.
speaker_heading: (MOR E)
dialog:

speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (2)
speaker_heading: PHI L (CONT'D)
dialog: So I'm guessing you've got some

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: Well, okay. I just wanted to say
dialog: thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: Doing the thing that we agreed,
dialog: keeping your word, keeping them
dialog: all away...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, that's okay, Gram. But I
dialog: don't need thanking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: You don't?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I'm just taking care of business.
dialog: That's what you paid me for -
dialog: that's what I do.
dialog: 
text: Gram grins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: You shooting for a raise?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Actually, I just quit.
dialog: 
text: Gram holds his hand out for the bottle and takes a drink.
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: Well, I s'pose I should be

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Goodbye, Gram. I'm glad it all
dialog: worked out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GRAM
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I said I'm glad it all worked
dialog: out.
dialog: 
text: And Gram is now Larry, peering down at Phil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: All what worked out?
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: CON TINUE D: (3)
dialog: 
text: Phil sits bolt upright and looks around the car. Larry and
text: Susie stare back at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Doesn't matter. Can we go now?
dialog: I'm getting sick of sand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY
dialog: 
dialog: We hear Gram's: 'Return Of The Grievous Angel' or some
dialog: similar music.
dialog: 
text: We follow Bernice as she drives through the desert, and
text: into Los Angeles. We follow her through the city streets,
text: and we stay with her as she parks.
dialog: Fade down music.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HEARSE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Phil turns off the ignition and sits back in his seat. He
text: and Larry look at each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well, we did it. We saved a
dialog: soul.
dialog: 
text: He leans across to hug Phil, who looks awkward and pats him
text: on the shoulder instead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Singed my damn mustache, that's
dialog: for sure.
dialog: 
text: Phil pulls a cigar out of his pocket and lights it. The
text: handcuff dangles from his wrist and bangs against the dash.
text: He stares at the match as it burns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Well, shall we?
dialog: 
text: Phil blows the match out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah. Let's roll, hippie.

dialog: 
text: There is a small moment of tension, before Phil grins at
text: her. They kiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUSIE
dialog: Get out of here. Finish it.
dialog: 
text: Phil pats Bernice's battered wing as he walks away and over
text: to where Larry is waiting. They cross the road and walk
text: into a building through heavy wooden doors. Pull back to
text: reveal a sign: 'Los Angeles Police Department'.
text: FADE UP ON SUPER: Phil Kaufman and Larry Osterberg
dialog: appeared in West L.A. Municipal Court on November 5, 1973 -
