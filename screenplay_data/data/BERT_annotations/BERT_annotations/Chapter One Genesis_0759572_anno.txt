speaker_heading: CHAPTER ONE
dialog: "In His Own Image"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A PAIR OF EYES
text: Intense. Focused. Filled with trepidation. But underneath
text: this fear, a hint of resolve. Whatever these eyes are staring
dialog: at, it's a seminal moment, one that HAS to be done. The
text: only sound - WIND, Just WIND, SWIRLING all around us.
text: WIDEN to find these eyes belong to ETHAN CAMBELL (mid-30's),
text: a kind face, a little innocent. He's dressed in a MALE
text: NURSE'S UNIFORM. A CHIRON says, “MIDTOWN MANHATTAN, NEW
dialog: YORK".
text: The SOUND of DISTANT CITY TRAFFIC begins to SEEP in. LOUDER
text: now, as we ARM DOWN his body to REVEAL him STANDING ON THE
text: VERY EDGE of a SEVENTY STORY SKYSCRAPER, the toes of his
text: Converse hanging two inches over the ledge. Teetering
text: dizzily.
text: We're getting VERTIGO just looking at it. Holy shit, this
text: guy is ABOUT TO JUMP. And you know what, he does -- He
text: Stretches his arms out in a SWAN DIVE position and LEANS
text: FORWARD and FALLS.
text: We watch in a SUBJECTIVE SHOT as he LEAVES THE LEDGE and
text: PLUMMETS down the side of the building at 127 MPH. The street
text: below races towards us, faster and faster... until... WHOOSH!
text: He STOPS. In MID-AIR. (Still SUBJECTIVE CAMERA) Hovers for
text: a beat, then just as quickly, BANKS LEFT and TAKES OFF! And
text: now he's actually fucking FLYING.
text: Thirty floors ABOVE THE STREET and SOARING in the most
text: beautiful and exhilarating (SUBJECTIVE CAMERA) FLYING sequence
dialog: you've ever seen!
text: SAILING THROUGH THE CANYONS OF MANHATTAN
text: SWOOPING and DIVING, ROLLING and TUMBLING at a hundred and
text: fifty MPH. ROLLING, BANKING, TUMBLING, he SOARS DOWN to a
text: busy street and comes to a FLOATING STOP, HOVERING fifty
text: feet above the crowded sidewalk, ROCKING SLOWLY, RHYTHMICALLY
speaker_heading: in MID AIR.
text: No one seems to notice except ONE LONE MAN, his head craned
text: back staring up at us. (We will soon come to know this man
text: as HARRISON CAMBELL, Ethan's brother.) As he stares up at
dialog: him curiously --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05 2.
speaker_heading: CABBIE (0.S.)
dialog: (Arabic accent)
dialog: Your stop, sir.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - MORNING 1
text: Ethan WAKES with a start to find himself in the back seat.
text: He takes a moment to get his bearings, obviously rattled by
text: the odd dream. The Middle Eastern CABBIE stares through the
dialog: partition at hin.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: You get out here, yes?
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Oh... Yeah. Sorry. I haven't been
dialog: sleeping much lately and... Sorry.
text: He pulls a couple BILLS out of his wallet and hands them to
text: the Cabbie. Climbs out.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS 2
text: Ethan, still reeling from the dream, stands on this busy
text: sidewalk, orienting himself. He looks up at a stately old
text: apartment building, then down at a BUS ROARING past. Someone
text: has plastered a CAMPAIGN POSTER on the side -- The smiling
text: face of HARRISON CAMBELL. (The guy Ethan just saw in the
text: flying dream) Underneath it reads, "Harrison Cambell -- State
dialog: Senate -- For A New Tomorrow".
text: Ethan stares for a beat, then starts towards the entrance of
text: the apartment building. He STOPS. Looks down at a COCKROACH
text: crossing his path. Fascinated by it, he watches as it CRAWLS
text: to the gutter and into DRAINAGE GRATE, and --
speaker_heading: SURESH (V.0.)
dialog: Man is a narcissistic species by nature.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY 3
scene_heading: THAT SAME COCKROACH
text: Or at least one that LOOKS LIKE IT, crawls out of a crack in
text: the wall and scurries along the floor.
speaker_heading: A HAND
text: reaches INTO FRAME and PICKS IT UP. WIDEN to meet Professor
text: MOHINDER SURESH, (mid-30's), a slightly nerdy Bast Indian
text: academician, standing in at the front of this LECTURE HALL
text: in an old, faded British colonial building.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
text: A CHIRON tells us this is "THE UNIVERSITY OF MADRAS, INDIA".
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: But we are not the pinnacle of so-called
dialog: evolution.
text: Behind him, he's written his lecture in HINDI on the
text: blackboard. (All but one word in English - “'TERAFORMA” . )
text: He lets the COCKROACH crawl along the back of his hand as he
text: speaks to a pathetically small group of FIVE STUDENTS
text: scattered among the empty seats in this large classroom.
speaker_heading: SURESH (CONT'D)
dialog: That honor belongs to the lowly
text: cockroach. A creature who has adapted
dialog: and evolved for 250 million years.
dialog: Capable of living for months without
text: food. Remaining alive headless for
dialog: weeks at a time.
text: As Suresh speaks, he looks up to see --
speaker_heading: THE DEAN
text: an elderly Brahmin, standing at the back of the class. Suresh
text: is little flustered by his presence. He continues --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SURESB (CONT'D)
dialog: Its female need only be impregnated
dialog: once to Lay over a million eggs in her
dialog: lifetime. Resistant to radiation, it
dialog: is the only species who will survive a
dialog: nuclear winter. If God has indeed
dialog: created himself in his own image, then
dialog: I submit to you that God is a cockroach.
text: The class stares at him, unsure what to make of this strange
text: pronouncement. The Dean nods, unamused. He CLAPS his hands
text: LOUD, twice, to get everyone's attention.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You are all dismissed. This class has
dialog: been canceled.
text: The five students stand, a little confused and shuffle out
text: as the Dean approaches Professor Suresh. (Their conversation
text: is in HINDI with English subtitles.)
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: Sir, I know the enrollment is down a
dialog: little this semester, but --
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I'm afraid this institution can no longer
dialog: support your tenure, Dr. Suresh...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: %
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: What are you saying?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You are being dismissed from the faculty.
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Your theories are unfounded.
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: {a body blow)
dialog: But...this is my life's work!
dialog: fhe truth is, no one believes in your
dialog: work and no one wants to publish your
dialog: theories.
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: BUT IT'S HAPPENING now! The world needs
dialog: to know!
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I'm... sorry. Our decision is final.
text: and off Suresh's stunned look -~
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SURESH'S APARTMENT ~ DAY
text: professor Suresh comes up the staircase of this four story
text: walk-up carrying his briefcase and 4 net bag full of
text: groceries. He moves to his door, fumbles for his key, then
text: STOPS. Something is wrong. Very wrong. It's the door.
text: It's OPEN a tiny crack.
text: suresh goes into FULL PANIC MODE. This is something he has
text: dreaded, but hasn't fully prepared for. “Think, think..."
text: He gathers his courage and GENTLY PUSHES the door open far
dialog: enough to see inside --
speaker_heading: SURESH'S POV --
text: the place is TORN APART. His gaze MOVES to a HUGE MAP OF
text: HE WORLD taking up an entire wail. The map has dozens of
text: COLORED PUSH PINS placed into different locations around the
text: world. A SHADOW washes over it. shit, someone's in there}
text: suresh pulls back, leans against the wall. Breathes. Forces
text: himself to think. Then, steeling himself, he pushes open
text: the door and slinks into --
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05 5.
scene_heading: INT. SURESH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 5
text: A dark, cluttered two room apartment. Stacks of BOOKS and
text: RESEARCH. The home of an obsessive, single-minded academic.
text: Suresh slinks to a desk, quietly tries to open a drawer.
text: Shit, it's STUCK. He PULLS hard and the desk shakes as the
text: drawer POPS OPEN. Something falis off the desk and lands at
text: his feet. A paix of HORNED RIMMED GLASSES. He picks them
text: up. Looks at them curiously. These are clearly NOT HIS.
text: Q.S. we HEAR someone RANSACKING the adjacent room.
text: He sets the glasses back down and reaches into the drawer.
text: Pulls out a small CAMERA. Aims it at the map on the wali.
text: SNAPS a photo. The FLASH GOES OFF! Shit. He cringes, as
text: the 0.8. RANSACKING suddenly STOPS. They've noticed.
text: Suresh RUSHES up to the map, reaches up and pulls out a WHITE
text: PUSH PIN that's right over MANHATTAN, turns and SPRINTS out
dialog: of the apartment.
text: And one second later, the FIGURE of a MAN, STEPS INTO the
text: FOREGROUND. Stands here, taking in the room, his BACK TO
text: us. Cold, calculating. We DO NOT see the man's face, but
text: he reaches down and picks up the HORN RIMMED GLASSES, slips
dialog: them on.
text: Steps up to the map on the wall. Studies it, sensing that
text: something's different. We PUSH RIGHT PAST him and onto a
text: PUSH PIN inserted into the map right over the central part
dialog: of NEVADA, .
text: As we PUSH IN farther, Nevada MORPHS to the WHITE SAND of a
text: SATELLITE IMAGE over the entire state. We SLAM IN, RACING
text: DOWN as DETAIL begins to emerge ~- The city of LAS VEGAS —
text: past the strip and INTO THE SUBURBS ~ Where we finally come
text: to a STOP over a the rooftop of a small TRACT HOUSE, and --
dialog: BLEED TO WHITE:
scene_heading: INT. NIKI SANDERS' GARAGE - MORNING 6
text: FADE IN ON A PAIR OF LACY PANTIES
text: as they slide slowly, sexily off a woman's shapely REAR END.
text: WIDEN to find NIKI SANDERS, (33), showgirl looks, completely
text: NAKED (strategically posed), holding the panties teasingly
text: in front of her. She COOS and makes a pouty, sexy face.
text: The CHIRON says, "LAS VEGAS, NEVADA".
text: We PULL FURTHER back to see her posed on a BED with a blue
text: satin bedspread. Shiny gold curtains hang behind the bed.
text: FURTHER BACK now and we realize that we are in a GARAGE.
text: This is a SET. Niki is performing for a WEBCAM on a tripod.
text: A cable stretches from the camera to a COMPUTER on a DESK.
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
text: Niki slips on a tiny silk robe and crosses to the computer.
text: Types quickly.
text: ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN
text: we see the words, "Time's up", The CURSOR BLINKS as it waits
text: for a response. A beat, then we see the response, “Just a
dialog: little more. Please. I'm almost there."
dialog: Niki's answers this by typing -- "It'll cost you another 39
dialog: bucks."
text: Niki waits for the response. The BLINKING CURSOR, then --
dialog: "BITCH!"
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Creep.
text: She turns and heads for the door, but stops. An odd look on
text: her face. A little scared. She whips around, as though
text: expecting someone to be there. She stares across the room
text: at a MIRROR. Her own REFLECTION stares back. Something
text: about it disturbs her.
text: She backs slowly to the door that leads into --
scene_heading: 7 INT. NIKI SANDERS' HOUSE - MORNING
text: A tiny cracker box of a house. Niki makes her way down the
text: narrow hallway, stepping over a baseball glove.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Time to wake up, Micah!
text: She comes to a stop at a bedroom doorway. Looks into -~
speaker_heading: MICAH'S BEDROOM
text: The domain of a messy ten year old boy. The bed is unmade,
text: but Micah is nowhere to be seen. (NOTE: We see Niki's
text: REFLECTION in a MIRROR on the back of the door. Her profile.)
text: Niki stares at the empty bed. Then suddenly a little
text: panicked, as a terrible thought dawns on her --
speaker_heading: NIKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Micah!
text: She turns and hurries down the hall. But as she does, her
text: REFLECTION in the mirror SP! SECOND LO!
text: than she did. This is barely perceptible and a little weird.
scene_heading: IN LIVING ROOM
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
text: Niki stops, looks. Tacky furnishings, no frills. These are
text: people living at the bottom of the American dream.
speaker_heading: NIKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Micah!
dialog: She heads into --
speaker_heading: THE KITCHEN
text: where we see MICAH, (10), of mixed race, half black, sitting
text: at the small table eating a bowl of FRUIT LOOPS, as he
text: examines a SHOE BOX next to him. He looks up innocently.
speaker_heading: MICAH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Dammit, Micah, don't do that to me.
speaker_heading: MICAH
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Nothing. Just... You need to be careful,
dialog: that's all. I don't want you talking
dialog: to any strangers, you understand?
dialog: Whoa, where's this coming from?
speaker_heading: MICAH
dialog: I'm just having breakfast.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: That's not breakfast. That stuff'1l
dialog: rot your brain.
text: Micah just goes back to work on the SHOE BOX, poking a whole
text: into the lid with a pen.
speaker_heading: NIKI (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MICAH
dialog: Making a pinhole camera... It's for the
dialog: eclipse,
dialog: (off her confused look)
dialog: The moon's gonna cover up the sun today.
dialog: We're supposed to look at it at school.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Speaking of which, go get ready. We
dialog: can’t be late. Not today.
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
speaker_heading: MICAH
dialog: I'm already dressed and packed my own
dialog: lunch,
dialog: (pointed)
dialog: That's what I've been doing this morning.
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Hey, don't get smart with me. I've
dialog: been working to Pay our bills!
speaker_heading: MICAH
dialog: Then why'd they turn off our gas again?
dialog: She doesn't have a comeback for that,
speaker_heading: MICAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Why can't you go back to work at the
dialog: casino? You made a lot of money there.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Because I can't, alright. and you're
dialog: not the adult here, I am.
speaker_heading: MICAH
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Yeah, sure you are.
text: Before she can respond, the DOORBELL RINGS. Niki stops. A
text: panicked look crosses her face.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: (ominous )
dialog: Grab your stuff and wait by the back
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: MICAH
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Just do it!
text: Niki turns and heads into ~-
speaker_heading: THE LIVING ROOM
text: where she crosses to the window and pulls back the curtains.
scene_heading: HER POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW
text: Two MEN stand at her front door. One is a little WEASEL of
text: a GUY in a tight LEATHER JACKET. The other is BIG, And I
text: mean big. The weasel is slipping on a pair of leather gloves.
dialog: Trust me, it's not that cold outside,
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE “Genesis" 12/2/05 9.
text: Niki shuts the curtain. Eyes wide. The DOORBELL RINGS again.
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: AT THE BACK DOOR
text: Niki, now in a bra and shimmying into a pair of jeans, .
text: wrestles a t-shirt over her head as she meets up with Micah.
text: He waits with his backpack. And now he's scared,
speaker_heading: MICAH
dialog: Mom, what's going on?
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Nevermind, just keep your voice down
dialog: and stay close to me.
text: They head out the door.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBOR'S SIDE YARD - SECONDS LATER 8
text: A FENCE, as Niki and Micah drop over it and SCURRY QUICKLY
text: to an old DATSON B210 parked at the curb.
text: Micah JUMPS into the passenger side. Niki unhooks the WIRE
text: that's holding the driver's side door shut and climbs in.
text: In a billow of EXHAUST SMOKE, the car lurches, then FISHTAILS
text: down the street. We RISE UP as it disappears around the
dialog: corner and ~-
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT, NIKI SANDERS' LIVING ROOM ~ SAME 9
text: WHAM! The front door SPLINTERS off its hinges! KICKED open.
text: The WEASEL and the BIG GUY step into the room, taking it in.
text: As they move off to search the Place --
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - PENTHOUSE APARTMENT — DAY 10
text: And FADE IN on ETHAN (our guy with the flying dream) leaning
text: against the headboard of a big bed, reading aloud from the
text: New York Times stock page. A HEADLINE on the folded page
text: facing us reads: "Skies Clear for Solar Eclipse".
text: On the bed, next to Ethan, an OLD MAN, (83), thin, frail,
text: lies dying, a breathing tube in his nose. Ethan is a hospice
text: nurse, hence the uniform. A warm and gentle soul, selfless,
dialog: almost a saint.
text: We're on the 3lst floor of the stately old apartment that we
text: saw earlier. A CHIRON Says, "UPPER EAST SIDE, MANHATT: me
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05 10.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "amCor sold at 68 and a half. GenCom
dialog: was down two to fifteen and an eighth."
dialog: That's sounds like a bargain to me,
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (painful, barely audible)
dialog: Money... Shit. The goddamn hippies had
dialog: it right. In the end it's only love
dialog: that matters.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: I'd like to think so.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: I'm...
dialog: (can't find the word)
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Thirsty. Here.
text: He takes a glass of water from the night stand, tips it gently
text: into the Old Man's mouth. He swallows painfully.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: How do you do that... know what I want
dialog: before I say it?
text: Ethan just smiles warmly at him.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to be dead soon,
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: (matter-of-fact)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: I want to do it right. Make it worth
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: I think it's about letting go.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: I know. But how?
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Look out the window there. see how
dialog: beautiful it is today?
text: He gestures to a large open window. Lace curtains billow in
text: the sunny breeze, Outside, a MAGNIFICENT MANHATTAN SKYLINE.
dialog: 
dialog: 11
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05 qi.
speaker_heading: ETHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: There's freedom out there. Peace. No
dialog: more pain, no more IV's. When you're
dialog: ready, just let yourself go there. Let
dialog: yourself... fly.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Can you show me?
text: Ethan looks at him, a little confused.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you show me how?
text: Ethan stares at him, then nods. He stands and turns towards
text: the window. Starts walking slowly towards it, picking up
text: speed. And just as we think he's about to JUMP OUT --
speaker_heading: STELLA (V.O.)
dialog: How's he doing?
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM ~ PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - SAME 11
text: Ethan WAKES, still on the bed, the New York Times resting on
text: his chest. The Old Man next to him lies UNCONSCIOUS. Ethan
text: looks up to see STELLA, (28), beautiful, bohemian, in a
text: colorful cotton dress. She's the Old Man's daughter.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I'm sorry, did I scare you?
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: No, it's just... I keep having these
dialog: weird dreams every time I close my
dialog: eyes...
dialog: (re: the newspaper)
dialog: He likes me to read him the stock page.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Has he been conscious?
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: No. Been nine days now. I think he's
dialog: close. Couple days maybe.
text: Stella nods, fighting her emotions.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I don't know what he'd do without you,
dialog: Ethan. You've got a real gift.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: dust doing my job.
dialog: 12
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE “Genesis” 12/2/05 12.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: No, you're like a son to him.
text: Ethan smiles, a little embarrassed --
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Then that would make us like brother
dialog: and sister. Could be a little awkward
dialog: if I ever wanted to ask you out.
text: And now it's Stella who looks at him embarrassed. He was
text: serious and they both realize it. He's got a crush on her.
dialog: And why not? So do we.
speaker_heading: ETHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, that was really inappropriate.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: No, you're sweet. It’s just... I'm
dialog: kinda seeing somebody and-~
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Yeah, it's okay, really.
dialog: (excusing himself)
dialog: I've gotta change his Iv...
text: As he walks off, Stella sits next to her father. Ethan walks
text: towards the WINDOW that he flew out of in his dream. It's
text: CLOSED, CURTAINS DRAWN. As he stops and stares at it, the
dialog: sight of it upsetting him --
scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM - SING SING PRISON - MORNING 12
scene_heading: We're in REAL TIGHT on the FACE of D.L. HAWKINS, (31). A
text: white man's nightmare, D.L. is a black man doing life in
dialog: prison with nothing to lose and mean as hell. But right
text: now, he's as peaceful as a baby -- sound ASLEEP on the floor.
text: The CHIRON says, "SING SING PRISON, NEW Yt a

text: eyes SNAP open.
scene_heading: HIS POV - (SIDEWAYS, GROUND ANGLE)
text: Four ROTTWEILERS tug at their leashes pulling a posse of
text: PRISON GUARDS, loaded for bear with SHOTGUNS and RIFLES.
text: D.L. sits up quickly and scoots back on his hands to a wall.
speaker_heading: PRISON GUARD
text: FREEZE! HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD!
text: The dogs are taut on their leashes, inches away from ripping
text: him apart, TEETH FLARING, DROOL FLYING. He's SCARED SHITLESS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05 13.
speaker_heading: PRISON GUARD (CONT'D)
dialog: How did you get out of your cell?!
text: D.L. just looks around, thoroughly confused.
speaker_heading: PRISON GUARD (CONT'D)
dialog: How the fuck did you get out of your
dialog: goddamn cell?!
dialog: DL.
dialog: I don't... I don't know.
text: And he's dead serious. He really has no idea.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY 13
text: CLOSE ON THE SMILING FACE OF HARRISON CAMBELL
text: WIDEN to find this image is one of several CAMPAIGN POSTERS
text: plastered on the window of a storefront campaign headquarters.
text: Ethan heads towards the entrance, but stops as a WAVE OF
text: PEOPLE head out, making their way towards two BLACK
text: EXPEDITIONS parked at the curb.
text: HARRISON CAMBELL, (34), Ethan's fraternal twin brother,
text: dressed in an Armani suit, turns and sees Ethan. Where Ethan
text: is a lost dreamer, Harrison is a golden boy. A star. A
text: look of trepidation crosses his face and he hurries over to
dialog: see Ethan.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: I've got two speeches and a fund raiser.
dialog: I'm late...
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: It happened two more times. And you
dialog: were in both of them.
speaker_heading: EARRISON
dialog: I can't do this, Ethan. Not now.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: They're not just dreams, Harrison.
dialog: They're too real, What if they're
dialog: telling me something?
speaker_heading: RARRISON
dialog: What are you talking about? Telling
dialog: you what?
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: What if they're telling me I can fly?
text: There. He said it. Harrison looks at him like he's nuts.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3 HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis” 12/2/05 14.
speaker_heading: @ ETHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (suddenly desperate)
dialog: When I got out of bed this morning, my
text: foot hovered before it hit the floor
text: for a split second. Like I was floating.
text: It's so real I'm afraid to go to sleep.
text: Harrison grabs him and pulls him against the wall.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: You need to snap the fuck out of this,
dialog: you understand?! Go see a doctor, get
dialog: some drugs. Just don't go pulling a
dialog: Roger Clinton on me. I've got ten days
dialog: left and I'm two points down.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: I know, I know. I'm sorry. It's just...
dialog: I have a feeling you're the only one
dialog: who understands this.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: (pissed)
dialog: Why?! Why the hell would I understand
dialog: that you think you can fly?!
speaker_heading: ee ETHAN
dialog: Because you're my twin brother! We
dialog: shared a womb--

scene_heading: INT. LOFT - DAY
text: A BUCKET of PAINT is tossed onto a PAINTING, destroying what
text: is a brilliant PHOTO-REALIST image of a PLANE CRASHING into
text: a BRIDGE.
text: PULL BACK to meet ISAAC BOROLO, (28), a wiry, handsome, but
text: strung-out junkie. Black jeans, a "Being John Malkovitch" te
text: shirt, barefoot, with a five-day growth on his face.
text: We're not sure what's going on with him, but he's frantic
text: about something and having a REALLY BAD DAY.
text: we're in a huge ARTIST'S LOFT with tin foil covering the
text: large windows. Only tiny CRACKS of SUNLIGHT seep through.
text: The CHIRON reads, “LOWER EAST SIDE, MANHATTAN". Isaac pulls
text: another painting from a stack against the wall. Another
text: photo-realist image - this one of a BUILDING BURNING.
text: Isaac grabs the bucket of paint and rears back to toss it--
speaker_heading: STELLA (0.5S.)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!
text: He stops and turns to see STELLA (the old dying man's
text: daughter) standing in the doorway, sunlight silhouetting
text: her, one hand leaning on the doorjamb.
text: He fills the bucket up with more paint. She approaches.
dialog: Pissed, confused -~
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you high?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: No. Yes. I don't know.
text: He tosses paint on ANOTHER PAINTING. This one has the image
text: of a TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Would you stop! What are you, crazy?!
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Clearly.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: You're chasing, aren't you?
text: He looks at her. Whatever that means, he's verified it with
text: his silence. She moves to the destroyed paintings. Looks
text: at them like they're dead kittens.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: When did you do these?
dialog: 15.
dialog: 14
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
text: He doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: These are fantastic. There's enough
dialog: here for a show. JI can call Arni, he
dialog: can get you gallery space...
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Not I can't.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Why not?!
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Because I don't even remember doing
dialog: them. I can only paint when I'm high.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: It doesn't matter. We'll get you back
dialog: into a program. It'll work this time.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: They're evil.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: He angrily crosses the paintings. Lifts one from the stack.
text: It's big, five feet wide. A photo-realism image of THREE
text: RACE HORSES crossing a finish line.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: This horse? Name is Applejax. This is
dialog: him winning the Santa Anita Derby in
dialog: the sixth race. I painted it three
dialog: weeks ago.
text: Stella stares at it, confused.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Yeah? So?
text: Isaac strides over to a table. Picks up a NEWSPAPER. Flips
text: through it. Shoves a page right into her face. Stella
text: stares, confused. And now WE SEE the page. It's a PHOTOGRAPH
text: in the Sports Section. It's the IDENTICAL IMAGE.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: That's this morning's paper. The race
dialog: was yesterday. Fucking yesterday!
text: Stella just blinks, trying to process what he's getting at.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: But that's...
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Impossible? Apparently not.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: You telling me you can paint the future?
text: Isaac doesn't answer. Just fills the bucket again.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's just a coincidence. You were high.
dialog: For all you know you could've painted
dialog: it this morning.
text: Isaac angrily pulls out another PAINTING from the stack.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: No. This one I painted this morning!
text: He spins it around for us to see. The image is of Stella
text: STANDING IN THE DOORWAY wearing the same flowery dress. The
text: EXACT IMAGE we first saw of her -- Sunlight silhouetting her
text: from behind, one hand leaning on the doorjamb above her head.
text: She stares at it, now a little freaked.
speaker_heading: ISAAC (CONT'D)
dialog: Something's. Wrong. With me.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: We'll get you help, Isaac.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I've tried that. Twice. There's only
dialog: one way left.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: You can't do that. Not alone. I can
dialog: help you. I love you. Please.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: NO! I'll drag you down with me, I swear
dialog: to God I will. dust leave me alone.
dialog: (off her stare)
dialog: Get out of here! NOW!
text: Stella holds his gaze. What she gets for falling in love
text: with a junkie. She neds and slowly backs away, turns and
text: walks out. Isaac watches her. Then stares at the paintings.
text: A moment of decision. He's got a plan and he's sticking to
text: it. He crosses quickly to a desk.
text: YANKS open a drawer and pulls out a ROLLED UP t-shirt.
text: Unrolls it onto the desk.
dialog: 
dialog: 17,
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
text: Inside is FIX KIT - a SYRINGE, a SPOON, a BURNER, a BAG OF
text: HEROIN. Another drawer YANKS open and he reaches in, pulls
text: out a pair of HANDCUFFS. Strides to the middle of the room.
text: Lays the fix kit down on the floor, opens it.
text: He walks back to the wall, sits, crosses his legs. Takes
text: ONE END of the handcuffs and SNAPS them onto his WRIST.
text: Takes THE OTHER END and SNAPS it onto the RADIATOR.
text: He stares at the heroin, ten feet away. So close, but now
text: impossible to get to. Off his steely determination --
scene_heading: EXT. ROCK QUARRY - DAY
text: We're looking at a SHAKY HOME VIDEO IMAGE of CLAIRE BENNET,
text: (17), standing on the edge of a TWO HUNDRED FOOT CLIFF at a
text: rock quarry, staring over the precipice. Claire has "girl-
text: next-door" looks, and to complete the cliché, she's dressed
text: in a CHEERLEADING OUTFIT. A CHIRON prints out across the
text: screen -- "ODESSA, TEXAS".
dialog: Claire's life up until now has been as ordinary as any kid
text: in rural America. But right now it's anything but ordinary.
text: Because at this moment, her arms outstretch and she leans
text: forward and... steps off the ledge. Like she's flying.
text: Except she's NOT flying. She's FALLING. And fast! We watch
text: this horrible incident like a bad “shock video” TV moment.
text: Until SPLAT! She hits the ground FULL FORCE. It's fucking
dialog: awful.
text: The CAMERA runs up to her, like assassination footage. We
text: hear the LABORED BREATHING of whoever is shooting this video
text: footage. The CAMERA stops and aims down at her BROKEN,
text: {JWISTED body. BLOOD on the rocks.
text: A long beat, then Claire begins to STIR. Slowly. She POPS
text: her dislocated leg BACK INTO ITS SOCKET. Her joints SQUISH
text: and SNAP into place. ‘Then she pries her bloody face off the
text: rock and looks right INTO CAMERA --

scene_heading: CLOSE ON A CLOCK FACE
text: that reads 1:47. The SWEEP HAND TICKS off the seconds
text: rhythmically. Tick, tick, tick...
text: ADJUST to see HIRO TANAKA, (24), staring at the clock
text: intensely. He's two feet away from it, his stare practically
text: poring a hole into it. His face is actually shaking, he's
text: concentrating so hard on it.
text: WIDEN to find Hiro at his cluttered desk in a tiny OFFICE
text: CUBICLE, the walls covered with JAPANESE ANIME CHARACTERS
text: pinned to every surface. The CHIRON says, “TOKYO, JAPAN".
text: Hiro is slight and nondescript in his short white sleeve
text: shirt and black tie. A worker bee in sea of worker bees.
text: However, Hiro has a hint of the nonconformist in him. A
text: little "spike" to his hairstyle. His tie a little too thin.
text: A small "punk" bracelet tucking out of his sleeve.
text: We HOLD on him, as his fervent stare intensifies on the clock -
text: eyes bulging, forehead sweating. And then... miraculously --
speaker_heading: THE SWEEP HAND
text: STOPS! QUIVERS and CLICKS ONE SECOND BACK - before resuming
text: its normal forward rhythm.
text: Hiro THRUSTS both fists into the air.
speaker_heading: HIRO
speaker_heading: BONSAI!
text: He leaps out of his chair and lunges out of the cubicle. We
text: TRACK WITH him as he SPRINTS down the long aisle, past what
text: seems like a hundred other cubicles in this bee hive of
dialog: workers.
scene_heading: IN ANOTHER CUBICLE
scene_heading: CLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN
text: A live VIDEO IMAGE of Niki (our webcam stripper) slipping
text: into her tiny robe. She's on the SET in her garage-
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
text: (This is the VERY SAME scene we saw earlier).
text: Niki walks past the camera, leaving just the image of the
text: empty bed. Under which, we see the words, "Time's up" type
text: out across the COMPUTER SCREEN.
text: WIDEN to meet ANDO MASAHASHI, (28), a little more conservative
dialog: looking than Hiro, and frankly a bit of a killjoy. Where
text: Hiro's cubicle was a cluttered mess, Ando's is exemplary in
dialog: its neatness.
text: Ando types his response to Niki. “Just a little more.
text: Please. I'm almost there." The CURSOR BLINKS, then Niki's
dialog: response, "It'll cost you another 39 bucks...."
text: Ando stares at the BLINKING CURSOR, then types “BITCH!”
text: Just then, Hiro SLIDES around a corner and into the cubicle.
text: Ando quickly hits a button on he keyboard - A SCREEN SAVER
text: for "Star Wars - Revenge Of The Sith” takes over the screen.
text: Hiro catches his breath for a beat, before -- (Their
dialog: conversation is in Japanese - subtitled to English.)
speaker_heading: HIRO (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: (impatient)

speaker_heading: HIRO
dialog: I've broken the space/time continuum!
speaker_heading: ANDO

speaker_heading: HIRO
dialog: My clock. I made it go back one second,
dialog: using only my mind, my thoughts.
speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: Too bad you're not paid by the hour.
dialog: You'd be onto something.
speaker_heading: HIRO
dialog: I'm serious. This explains the subway

speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: It was fourteen seconds late. Big deal.

speaker_heading: HIRO
dialog: yes. I have discovered powers beyond

speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: Right. You and Spock.
speaker_heading: BIRO
dialog: (finally, you get it)
dialog: Yes. Like Spock. Exactly.
text: Suddenly, Hiro is grabbed by the scruff of his shirt. It's
text: his BOSS, who starts YELLING at him as he drags him away.
text: We're not sure what he's yelling, but we can guess it has
text: something to do with getting his ass back to work.
text: Ando pokes his head out of his cubicle and watches with a
text: smile as Hiro is dragged humiliatingly away -~
speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: (yelling after)
dialog: Use your ‘death grip', Spock! The ‘death
dialog: grip’!

text: the Principal's office.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - SAME 18
text: Niki sits across the desk from PRINCIPAL KEARNS, a tweedy ex-
text: hippie. Beard, corduroy jacket. Niki is pretty agitated,

speaker_heading: KEARNS
dialog: I'd like to tell you it's only his test
dialog: scores, but it's pervasive.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: He's just a little behind though, right?

dialog: Look, I'm a single mom and I work nights

speaker_heading: KEARNS
dialog: People pay a lot of money to send their

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Yeah, well so do I!
speaker_heading: KEARNS
dialog: They expect an academic standard that

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: I wrote a check for twenty five thousand
dialog: dollars to get him into this snobfestl
dialog: I was told that's what it took! Not to

text: In the b.g., Micah has noticed things heating up in here.
dialog: Kearns
speaker_heading: KEARNS
dialog: And your donation was very appreciated.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Well I want it back.
text: just looks at her.
speaker_heading: NIKI (CONT'D)
dialog: I want it back now. Preferably in cash.
speaker_heading: KEARNS

dialog: Then un-spend it!

scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05 23.

text: Niki reaches across the desk and GRABS him by the collar,
text: HOISTS him out of his seat.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Fuck you, I want my money back!
speaker_heading: KEARNS
dialog: That's... not possible.

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Come on, let's get outta here.
dialog: (looking back at Kearns)
dialog: You're too good for this lousy school.
text: She pulls Micah towards the door, but passes a MIRROR along
text: the way. She catches her REFLECTION in it. Stops. Looks
text: at herself. Something about it pisses her off.
text: She strides up to the mirror, stares. Then rears her hand
text: pack. And just as she's about to strike her palm into the
text: glass - her REFLECTION SLIDES UP and OUT of the frame.
text: WHAM! She SHATTERS the empty mirror with her palm. Then
text: follows the trajectory of WHERE THE REFLECTION WENT. she
text: stares up at the corner of the ceiling at something we CANNOT
text: see. A long and strange beat, as everyone stares at her.
speaker_heading: MICAH
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: (at something unseen)

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Then why'd you want me to tape it?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: 20E
dialog: I still can't believe you asked me.
dialog: You stopped talking to me in sixth grade.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Safer this way.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Why, cuz I'm not popular and no one
dialog: would believe me even if I did tell,
dialog: which I won't?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I mean, it's not like you're not going

scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE “Genesis” 12/2/05
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: Popular?! Who's talking about popular?!
dialog: My life as I know it, is over, okay?!
dialog: I've got the Bishop game next week, the

speaker_heading: Z0E
dialog: You're being a little dramatic, don't
dialog: you think?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No! I don't think. Look at me. I
dialog: busted like every bone in my body,

speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: Then what do you call that?

text: It's almost too gross and bloody to look at.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (only slightly annoyed)
dialog: Great...

speaker_heading: CLAIRE (CONT'D)
dialog: Just give me the tape, okay?
text: She holds out her hand, impatiently snaps her fingers. Z0e

text: Claire, on the spot, hesitates.
speaker_heading: SANDRA
dialog: I know what she means.
text: Claire looks at her, a mixture of fear and relief.
speaker_heading: SANDRA (CONT'D)
dialog: Here I am talking about getting passed
dialog: over for a silly little raise, and you
dialog: go and say something really profound.
dialog: We come to all kinds of cliffs in our
dialog: lives. And when we face our fears and
dialog: jump, we usually don't get hurt.

scene_heading: INT. TAXI - LATE AFTERNOON 41
text: Ethan climbs into back seat of the cab, stares out the window
text: up at the sky. The LIGHT has darkened from ECLIPSE, and we
dialog: realize we are RIGHT where and when we last left him.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: (to 0.S. driver)
dialog: The corner of Center and Canal, please.
text: The taxi pulls away and Ethan stares out the window up to
dialog: the sky.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
text: as a HAND reaches up to adjust it. In its REFLECTION we see
text: Ethan from the driver's perspective. A voyeuristic moment,
text: as Ethan has no idea he‘s being spied upon.
speaker_heading: SURESH (0.S.)
dialog: A Solar Eclipse.
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
text: Ethan looks up at the driver, It's PROFESSOR SURESH, looking
text: as anonymous as any other Third World cabbie in Manhattan.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Oh. Yeah. Wonder if it's gonna be
dialog: total?
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: Not here, no. Some other part of the
dialog: world, yes. A true global event. Makes
dialog: one appreciate how small our planet
dialog: really is.
text: Ethan looks at Suresh, intrigued by his observation.
speaker_heading: SURESH (CONT'D)
dialog: But then, we are all rather small, aren't
dialog: we?
text: Ethan nods as he stares at Suresh. It's an odd stare, an
text: instant and overwhelming need to open up this conversation.
dialog: A perfect stranger, no strings. What's the harm?
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: Mohinder.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: I'm Ethan.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let me ask you something, Mohinder.
dialog: You ever have the feeling you were meant
dialog: to do something extraordinary?
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: I'm driving a cab. You may have noticed.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: I'm not talking about what you do. I'm
dialog: talking about who you are. I'm talking
dialog: about being special.
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: We are all special.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: That's not what I mean.
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: Some individuals, it is true, are more
dialog: special. This is natural selection.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
speaker_heading: %, ETHAN
dialog: (interesting...)
dialog: Like evolution.
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: What is it that makes a species, after
dialog: millions of years, suddenly adapt to
dialog: catastrophic changes in their
dialog: environment? Overnight. Literally.
text: We PUSH IN on Ethan as Suresh continues. Ethan is riveted.
speaker_heading: SURESH (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The ice age hits and a hundred thousand
text: species go extinct immediately.
dialog: (snaps his fingers)
dialog: Like that. While others, no more unique
dialog: ox complex, change and adapt in
dialog: extraordinary ways, insuring the survival
dialog: of their species. The cockroach, for
dialog: instance.
text: We PUSH IN on Ethan as Suresh's lecture continues. Ethan is
text: riveted. This is speaking to the very core of his being.
speaker_heading: SURESH (CONT'D)
text: It begins with a single individual,
dialog: born or hatched like every other member
text: of their species, Anonymous, seemingly
dialog: ordinary. Except they're not. They
dialog: carry inside them the genetic code that
dialog: will take their species to the next
dialog: evolutionary rung.
text: Ethan is now staring off at nothing. Slowly nodding his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: SURESH (CONT'D)
dialog: So if one feels they are special, that
dialog: they have unique abilities, then they
dialog: have an evolutionary imperative to
dialog: discover those abilities. It's their
dialog: destiny.
text: Ethan swallows. He looks like he's about to leap out of his
dialog: skin. No words have ever rung truer. And breaking this
text: strange silence -~ RING, his cell, Ethan jumps, then answers.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: (to phone)
dialog: Hello?... Stella... I was just going
dialog: home, but... No, it's no problem. I
dialog: can be there in ten minutes. That's
dialog: okay, I'll see you there.
text: He hangs up.

scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
speaker_heading: ETHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I get out here, please?
text: Suresh studies him for a beat, then pulis the cab over.
text: Ethan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a ten, drops it
text: through the window of the partition. He opens the door and
text: starts to get out.
text: Ethan holds his gaze for a beat, unable to speak. Then turns
text: and rushes off. Suresh watches him as another MAN slides
text: into the back seat. We do NOT see his face, but he is dressed
text: in a DARK SUIT. And for a split second we think we catch
text: just a glimpse of his HORN RIMMED GLASSES.

speaker_heading: WEASEL (0.8.)
dialog: Fifty grand is a lot of money.
text: Niki is thrown onto her bed. Violently. (Only a minute and
dialog: fourteen seconds have passed since last we saw her.) She

speaker_heading: WEASEL (CONT'D)
dialog: But we wanna be fair about this.
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Fifty? It was thirty. Even with
dialog: interest-—
speaker_heading: WEASEL
dialog: Shoulda read the fine print.
text: The Weasel pulls up a chair as the Big Guy checks out her

speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Look, I have a son. I'm all he's got.
dialog: Please. I can get the money.
speaker_heading: WEASEL
dialog: Tell you what, let's start with a little

dialog: forty bucks every twenty minutes for
dialog: taking off your clothes?
text: Niki looks at them, unsure what he's getting at.
speaker_heading: WEASEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna give you a chance to work off

text: TURNING echoes in the garage.
speaker_heading: WEASEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (leaning back)
dialog: Go on, let's see what you got.
text: Niki sits up on her knees on the bed and slowly, timidly
text: begins to rub her hands seductively up and down her body.
text: She starts to cry, but stops herself. Gets into character.
text: Undoes the buttons on her shirt -- starting at the top and
text: working her way down. One by one. Slow as she can.
text: The two men smile. And as she undoes the top button of her
text: jeans -~ she STOPS. Looks at something just behind the two
text: men. They notice. Turn and look back behind them to see --
speaker_heading: NIKI'S REFLECTION
dialog: din the MIRROR that we saw the first time we were here.
text: Nothing unusual. They look back at Niki.
text: But she keeps looking at her reflection.
speaker_heading: WEASEL (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the problem, baby? It's just
dialog: getting good.
text: But Niki doesn't respond. She just keeps staring at the
text: reflection. The Weasel is pissed. He stands, crosses to
text: her, BACKHANDS her across the face.
speaker_heading: WEASEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I said, what's your problem?!
text: Niki gets back up. Scowls at him defiantly --
speaker_heading: NIKI
dialog: Fuck you.

speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: I'm sorry?
scene_heading: HORNED RIMMED GLASSES
dialog: Your name. On your license there.
text: Suresh looks down at his LICENSE and PHOTO, displayed on the
dialog: dash.
text: And now we get our first real look at the Man with the HORNED
text: RIMMED GLASSES. A sort of young Max Von Sydow-type.
text: Sophisticated, unknowable. He's toying with Suresh. He
dialog: knows exactly who he is.
speaker_heading: HORNED RIMMED GLASSES (CONT'D)
dialog: That's Indian, yes?
text: Suresh stares at him through his rear view mirror. Those
text: GLASSES. He knows them. It lands. Hard.
speaker_heading: HORNED RIMMED GLASSES (CONT'D)
dialog: (musing)
dialog: Probably lots of Suresh's where your
dialog: from. Like Smith or Anderso--
text: SKIIIDDDDD! The tires LOCK as Suresh SLAMS on the BRAKES.

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - SAME
text: We CRANE UP over the taxi, its driver's door wide open, and

scene_heading: INT. KARIOKI BAR - NIGHT 45
text: Ando stands at the bar. (About forty seconds of time has
text: passed since we last saw them.) He takes two bottles of
text: Asahi and turns back towards the table where he and Hiro
text: were sitting. Hiro is gone. He sees a COMMOTION near the
text: back of the place. A BOUNCER is dragging Hiro out of the
text: women's bathroom as two WOMEN scream angrily at him.
dialog: 
text: Ando watches the Bouncer drag Hiro right past him and out
text: the front door, tossing him onto the sidewalk. Ando looks

speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: Enough! There is NO SUCH THING as

speaker_heading: HIRO
dialog: Fine, don't believe me.
speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: There are twelve and a half million
dialog: people in this city. Not one of them
dialog: can bend space and time. Why do you
dialog: want to be different?!
speaker_heading: HIRO
dialog: No. The question is, why do you want
dialog: to be the same?!
speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: Because, that's what I am! The same.
speaker_heading: HIRO
dialog: Exactly. It's what we all are. Look
text: at us. We dress the same. We look the
dialog: same. We do the same jobs. Just like
text: everyone else. Homogeneous. Yogurt.
speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: (now he's mad)
dialog: Yogurt, huh? Last year at the company
dialog: banquet, the whole department sang
dialog: karioki. Madonna, Tears for Fears,
dialog: Abba, Duran Duran... But who sang Barry
dialog: White? Me. That's different enough.
speaker_heading: HIRO
dialog: Sure. For you. But I want to be
dialog: special.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: We are not special! We are Japanese!
speaker_heading: HIRO
dialog: Fine. Stay here. Be just like everyone
dialog: else. I wanna go boldly where no man

text: And he walks off. Ando watches him go.
speaker_heading: ANDO
dialog: That's right, you’re special! You're
dialog: “Super Hiro"! Go find your purpose!

scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Ethan enters, looks up to see Stella rifling through the

speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Morphine.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: What for?

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I need you to come with me someplace.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: You'll see.

speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Look, I can’t work for your father
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What? What are you talking about?
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE “Genesis” 12/2/05
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: I can't, I need to make some changes
dialog: in my life. I can't keep living for
dialog: other people. I need to spread my wings,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (snaps)
dialog: We'll talk about this later! Right now
dialog: I need you to come with me. You're a
dialog: nurse, you can give a shot. You can
dialog: help him.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Help who?
text: But she doesn't answer, as she strides towards the door.
text: Off Ethan, wondering what he's getting into --
scene_heading: INT. CELL - SING SING PRISON ~ NIGHT

scene_heading: ACROSS THE HALL
text: D.L. stands by the bars of his cell, a strange glazed look
text: on his face.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Somethin’ you want, brother?
text: D.L. doesn't answer. Zeke stands and crosses to the bars of
text: his own cell. Stares at D.L., studies him.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
text: Still no response from D.L., just the strange expression.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (CONT'D)
dialog: {realizing)
dialog: Damn... You're sleepwalking, ain't you?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Go back to bed. I'm serious. This
dialog: ain't natural. Go back to bed.
text: He waits to see if D.L. will comply. He doesn't. Zeke turns

speaker_heading: SANDRA (0.S.)

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: But nothing. I just wanted to tell you

speaker_heading: SANDRA (0.S.)
dialog: No, you think I'm trying to be your

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's alright, really, we can go to the

speaker_heading: SANDRA (0.S.)
dialog: (voice rising over noise)
dialog: I just miss you, that’s all. I want to

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I want advice. I do. I won't push you
dialog: away, I promise.
text: And just then, her CLASS RING slips off her finger and INTO
text: the disposal. Without thinking, Claire PLUNGES her hand in
text: to retrieve it. The disposal WHIRS and GRINDS hideously as
text: her fingers are GROUND in it. She pulls her hand out, and
text: in her BLOODY, MANGLED FINGERS, she holds the RING. She

scene_heading: HERCES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
speaker_heading: SANDRA {0.S.)
dialog: I just don't think you should be so

speaker_heading: SANDRA (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want to see you make mistakes

dialog: isn't wonderful, but my point is, you

dialog: it's enough. Because who you are is

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: About that, mom... There's something I

scene_heading: INT. NIKI SANDERS' GARAGE - NIGHT
text: We're IN REAL TIGHT on Niki's face, lying in a smear of her

dialog: something and GASPS.
speaker_heading: NIKI'S POV -
text: The place looks like a fucking TORNADO RIPPED THROUGH IT.
text: Our two bad guys, the WEASEL and the BIG GUY lay DEAD on the

text: They've been SAVAGELY BEATEN.
text: BROKEN MIRROR SHARDS are everywhere. One LARGE PIECE is
text: sticking out of the Weasel's neck, his eyes still wide open.
text: The Big Guy's own gun is SHOVED into his MOUTH, a pool of
text: BLOOD behind his head.
text: Niki stands up and STAGGERS off the bed. She turns all the
text: way around, totally freaked, looking for the unseen culprit
text: of this insane KILLING SPREE.
text: She backs up, stepping over the Big Guy's dead carcass and
text: BUMPS INTO the webcam's tripod. Catches it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEROES VOLUME ONE "Genesis" 12/2/05
text: Suddenly realizes that the camera's RED LIGHT is STILL ON.
text: It dawns on her in a flash. She shuts off the camera and
text: unclips it from the tripod. Carrying it, she starts to turn
text: when something catches her eye.
text: Looking OVER HER SHOULDER from BEHIND her, we now see what
text: it is -- The BUSTED MIRROR, half the glass broken out of its
text: frame. In the mirror - HER OWN REFLECTION. She stares at
text: herself in the cracked pieces of glass, dividing her like a
text: jigsaw puzzle.
text: And suddenly, like something out of a freaky horror film,
text: her REFLECTION MOVES, independent of her. It RAISES its

text: And off Niki, her life suddenly upside down --
scene_heading: EXT. SING SING PRISON - NIGHT
text: We're TIGHT ON D.L.'s FACE. Again, like when we first met

scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - TOKYO - NIGET
text: We TILT DOWN from that same MOON to find Hiro strolling down

text: Stops and stares at his own reflection the window.
text: Along with the various TRAVEL POSTERS on display, there is
text: wall of CLOCKS displaying the different TIME ZONES around
text: the world. He closes his eyes from fatigue, pinching the
text: bridge of his nose. As he does, we see EVERY CLOCK begin to
text: SPIN wildly.
text: He opens his eyes back up and they stop. He didn't notice.
text: He nonchalantly glances up at a poster of TIMES SQUARE in
text: New York City, all lit up at night.
text: He stares it, smiles and slowly turns to walk away. He takes
text: a couple of steps and stops. A stunned look on his face.
text: He stares up and all around him and we SLOWLY PULL BACK to

dialog: Isaac?! I brought someone to help you.
dialog: He's a nurse.
text: There's no response. Ethan follows behind her, but stops,

text: Stella aims the light up towards the radiator that Isaac

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Jesus, Isaac, what have you done?
dialog: But Ethan has come to a stop, He's seen something. We don't

speaker_heading: ETHAN'S POV -
text: A PAINTING on an easel, half finished. It’s ETHAN! He's
text: LEAPING OFF a building, wearing the same clothes he's wearing
text: right now, arms outstretched, like a swan dive.
text: Ethan steps right up to the painting. Reaches out and touches

text: Ethan, still frozen by his own image leaping off a building,
text: finally senses something and turns to see the huge painting
text: on the wall. And as he takes it all in --
dialog: FADE OUT AND INTO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP OF BUILDING ~- NIGHT
text: Close ON A PAIR OF SHOES DANGLING in mid-air. We RISE UP to
text: find Ethan sitting on the ledge of a fifteen story building,
text: legs over the side. He looks down, sees a TAXI pull up to
text: the alley below. HARRISON hops out, rushes to the edge of
text: the building, looks up at him, Ethan stands up on the ledge.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: (feigning nonchalance)
dialog: I got your message! What are you doing
dialog: here, Ethan?!
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Finding out who I am!
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: You know who you are! You're my brother!
dialog: My better half! The nicest guy on the
dialog: planet!
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: (welling up)
dialog: Yeah! That's me! Or at least it used
dialog: to be! I can fly, Harrison! I just
dialog: need to do it! I need to take the leap!

dialog: And if you can't?!
speaker_heading: ETBAN
dialog: Then at least I’1l find out! I was
dialog: born right next to you, I guess I'll
dialog: die that way, too!
text: Ethan steps closer to the edge.
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: Ethan, dammit, stop screwing around!
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: No. It's my turn to be somebody now!
text: And he LEAPS off the ledge, arms outstretched, just like the
text: PAINTING! Like he can fly. But he doesn't... and he DROPS.
dialog: Actually, PLUMMETS is a better word. Like a stone! Falling
dialog: and flailing! Its awful. And just as we're convinced we're
text: about ot witness a horrible death -- He STOPS! In mid air!
text: It's like in the first dream. Except -- He looks down to

speaker_heading: HARRISON

text: They stare into each other's eyes, both as freaked by this
dialog: as the other.
speaker_heading: ETHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You...$ How did you...?
speaker_heading: HARRISON
dialog: I...I don't know.
text: Ethan is heavy, and Harrison unsteady. He can't hold him
text: up. Ethan SLIPS out of Harrison's arms! Harrison GRABS
text: onto Ethan's HAND, suspending beneath him, dangling by the
text: tips of his fingers.
speaker_heading: HARRISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Ethan... Oh god...
text: A desperate beat, as they try to hold on.
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: It's okay. I love you, Harrison.
text: And as Ethan's fingers BEGIN TO SLIP, Harrison HOLDS ON for
