speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT - SAM
text: hidden by the undergrowth. CAMERA PANS with him as he moves
text: silently forward -- towards the revolver....
speaker_heading: CADY
text: CAMERA TRACKS with Cady as (poker clutched in his hand), he
text: stalks Sam. The angle is such that we are aware that Cady has
text: spotted Sam - but that Sam himself is unaware of Cady's silent
text: approach. Just when it seems that Cady is going to kill Sam --
text: Sam glimpses the raised poker, and scrambles to his feet.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: darts aside through some trees. Cady following him. Now Cady
text: suddenly jumps to one side, and for an instant it looks as
text: though Sam is trapped against the trunk of a tree. . Cady ad-
text: vances on him, and suddenly swings viciously with the poker.
text: By a hair's breadth Sam contrives to move aside. The poker
text: whistles through the air and cuts through the bark of the tree
dialog: like matchwood,.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: stumbles through the long grass and brushwood and flings him-

scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT ~ CADY
text: breathing heavily, blood trickling down his face -- murder in
text: his eyes as he hunts his victim.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: CAMERA TRACKS with him as he makes his way down the gully towards
text: the water's edge. He reaches it and begins to search in the
text: grass for the revolver, At last he sees it -- a few feet away.
text: He is just reaching it, and has almost got his hands on it --
text: when suddenly he has to roll aside, Almost simultaneously the
text: poker crashes through the air and cuts into a log, splintering

text: One savage stroke comes near to hitting Sem -- and he has to
text: move aside and give himself away. Cady leaps towards him, and
text: Sam -- pressed against the far bank of the gully -- seems to
dialog: be at his mercy.
text: Cady “savours" this for a brief moment, then raises the poker
text: for the "kill." In the same instant there is a TERRIFIED SCREAM
speaker_heading: PEGGY
text: her hair drenched, and her wet dress clinging to her body --
text: has struggled ashore. Though near complete exhaustion she
text: moves toward Cady. This "interruption" gives Sam the chance
text: to roll aside -- and again Cady goes berserk -- thrashing at
dialog: the ground, each and every stroke could be the death of Sam.
text: In terror =-- not knowing what she is doing -= Peggy runs forward.
text: Cady is momentarily distracted.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: This gives Sam the chance he has been waiting for. Ina last
text: desperate gamble, he scrambles forward towards the revolver.
text: Cady comes after him. Sam gropes for the gun -- and just as
text: Cady is about to hit him, Sam gets the revolver and twists
text: around and fires.
speaker_heading: CADY
text: is already delivering Sam's "death blow" -- as he is hit by the
text: bullet from the revolver, the poker spins from his hand, and
text: Cady reels aside clutching his shoulder. He looks surprised
text: and stunned.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: In the same moment Sam is on his feet -~- revolver levelled at
