speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: And that’s exactly what my boss

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Listen, bud, look, I’1l be happy to

speaker_heading: HALLEY

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: She's just talking to these ladies.

speaker_heading: JANCEY

speaker_heading: HALLEY

speaker_heading: CASE WORKER
dialog: So...
speaker_heading: HALLEY

speaker_heading: DCF INVESTIGATOR (CONT’D)

text: Bobby thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: If I did, you would have heard from

speaker_heading: DCF INVESTIGATOR

dialog: accusations. She could be back here
dialog: by the end of the week. Hopefully
dialog: there is nothing to find. You
dialog: understand?
text: Halley just stares.
speaker_heading: CASE WORKER (CONT’D)
dialog: Now, I have to warn you. Staying

dialog: your best interest. You do what you
dialog: did today and your actions will be
dialog: considered detrimental to Moonee.
dialog: This will not help your case in any
dialog: way. You understand?

scene_heading: INT. MAGIC CASTLE - ROOM 323 - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NAREK
dialog: Are you crazy? You want a court
dialog: case against Magic Castle? That’s
dialog: the last thing I need. They can

speaker_heading: DCF INVESTIGATOR
