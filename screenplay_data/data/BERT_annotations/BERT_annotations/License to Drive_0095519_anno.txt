scene_heading: EXT. COMMERCIAL SUBURBAN STREET - COLD FOGGY MORNING
text: No cars. Swirls of newspapers blow across the street.
text: Suddenly, a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS BECOMES VISIBLE, rising over a
text: hill. As it gets nearer, we feel the ROAR of the engine.
text: The bus is a monster. As it rumbles by us we SEE "SUNNY
text: MEADOWS HIGH SCHOOL" inscribed on the side.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE SCHOOL BUS
text: Grimy. Run down. School Bus Hell. Oppressed grey-faced
text: HIGH SCHOOLERS sit round-shouldered, looking out into nowhere
dialog: land.
text: WE DOLLY SLOWLY ALONG the floor TO REVEAL all the students'
text: ankles SHACKLED and CHAINED to their seats. The faint rhythm
text: of a FILE RUBBING AGAINST STEEL becomes louder and louder
text: until the CAMERA STOPS ON a student's hands. Seconds away
text: from filing through the lock on his shackle... FREEDOM.
text: The CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL LES ANDERSON, sixteen, maybe
text: seventeen. He's the only kid on the bus with a spark of life
text: left in him.
text: As the bus stops at a RED LIGHT, something catches Les' eye.
scene_heading: LES' P.O.V. - THROUGH A GREASY WINDOW - A RED BLUR
text: He wipes the window, revealing a RED FERRARI 308 GIB parked
text: beside the bus, outside a CORNER GROCERY STORE. The T-ROOF
text: is off, and all we CAN SEE are the LONGEST, MOST BEAUTIFUL
text: LEGS lounging in the passenger seat. A GUY walks away from
text: the car into the store.
speaker_heading: LES
text: lecks to the back of the bus, to the REAR DOOR, clearly
text: marked "FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY." He teeters on the edge of
text: his seat, about to make a move. He looks to the front of the
dialog: bus, at the:
speaker_heading: BUS DRIVER
text: A maniac: mid-40s, lousy toupee. He's been watching Les in
text: his rearview mirror the entire time. They stare at each
text: other, eye to eye. Les holds his ground. The driver thrusts
text: the bus in gear and begins to pull away... away from the
dialog: Ferrari.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Les explodes from his seat, charging for the "emergency
text: door." The kids come to life, watching and screaming with
text: excitement. Les kicks at the door.
text: A RED WARNING LIGHT on the Driver's dash flashes. An ALARM
text: sounds. The Driver looks back, angrily. Then pushes a
dialog: button.
text: A STEEL BOLT slams across the door. Les slams through the 7
text: back window -- diving out of the bus onto the street. Les
text: bounces out of a COMMANDO ROLL and runs up the street to the
dialog: Ferrari.
text: The bus does a spectacular BOOTLEGGER'S turn. It's coming
dialog: back.
text: LES LOOKS INTO THE FERRARI
text: Keys dangle from the ignition. In the passenger seat is the
text: LEGGIEST BLONDE GIRL you've ever seen. The approaching bus
text: builds speed. Les jumps into the car.
text: She smiles, seductively. He smiles back. They're in love.
text: The bus screams towards them. Les turns the ignition, pops
text: the clutch, then squeals into a right turn slicing onto a:
scene_heading: QUIET TREE-LINED SUBURBAN STREET
text: The bus roars after them, barely making the turn, balancing
text: on two wheels.
text: LES RACES DOWN THE STREET
text: Looks at his speedometer: 70... 75... 80... 85. Maple trees
text: whip by like he's in a rocket ship. AWESOME! He looks up at
text: his rearview mirror. It's all yellow. Miraculously, the bus
text: is right on his tail. Suddenly:
text: A LITTLE BOY DELIVERING PAPERS
text: Hops the curb and bicycles across the street. Les, about to
text: hit him, yanks the wheel left, practically tearing it off its
text: column. The bus bombs by, slicing the front tire off the
text: bike. The LITTLE BOY is left there on his seat, spinning
text: around acrobatically on his back tire.
speaker_heading: THE FERRARI
text: still trying to lose the bus, streaks down a street, then
text: screeches into:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: NARROW BACK ALLEY
text: So narrow they spell it with one "1". The bus slams in,
text: rocking and rebounding off the alley's walls. Dragging power
text: cords and live wires, sparks shoot out from the bus' sides.
text: Les jams on his brakes, cuts and slides right onto a:
scene_heading: WIDE COMMERCIAL STREET
text: Les guns it! A laser beam. With one hand he downshifts to
text: accelerate, with the other, he starts to light the girl's
text: cigarette... She pulls his hand closer to her, looking into
text: his eyes.
text: But WAIT! Up ahead, by a GAS STATION, there's a HUGE PUDDLE
text: OF WATER. But it's not water. It's GAS! A tank pumps gas
text: into a tanker fuel truck. GAS spews from a ruptured hose.
text: Suddenly, we hear a BORING MONOTONE voice.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Remember. Be prepared and look
text: ahead. The driver must see the BIG
dialog: PICTURE...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: A dark classroom. The sound of a projector. Flickering
text: light. An instructional film is being shown to a class of
text: DRIVER'S ED STUDENTS. The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the room and
text: stops in back where we FIND Les Anderson, head on his desk,
text: fast asleep, resting on his DRIVER'S ED BOOKS.
speaker_heading: VOICE OVER
dialog: Â«+eIn heavier rain, your tires may
text: begin to 'hydroplane,' ride on the
text: water, rather than the pavement.
dialog: Don't panic! And especially don't
dialog: jam on the brakes. Ease your foot
text: off the gas pedal.
scene_heading: INT. FERRARI - DAY
text: High speed. There's no avoiding the puddle. Les EASES HIS
text: FOOT off the gas pedal. The Ferrari remains steady as a 15-
text: foot spray of gas erupts on either side of the car. He
text: finishes lighting the girl's cigarette, then casually tosses
text: the match out the window.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: INSIDE THE BUS
text: The driver shifts gears with reckless abandon, charging for
text: the puddle. Suddenly, the puddle ignites. There's a HUGE
text: EXPLOSION. The bus driver JAMMMMS on his brakes. Headed
dialog: straight for it.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE FERRARI
text: Les and the girl hear the explosion and turn around
text: simultaneously. There's no bus, just a huge WALL OF FLAME.
text: They smile at each other. They've made it... Les leans over
text: to kiss her, but suddenly she's not smiling. Her mouth is
text: open in shock. There's terror in her eyes. We hear the ROAR
text: OF AN ENGINE. Les looks back at the road.
text: THE BUS IS HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THEM
text: about to smash into them. WE HEAR a LOUD HORN which becomes
text: a SCHOOL BELL.
scene_heading: INSERT - SCHOOL BELL
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - CLOSE ON LES - DAY
text: He wakes up, startled. He has sleep marks on one side of his
text: face. He looks around, embarrassed. The bell stops.
text: Standing in front of him is the DRIVER'S ED TEACHER, MR.
text: GASKET, the bus driver from the dream. The class is getting
text: up from their desks, leaving. He motions for Les not to
dialog: move.
text: Leaving the class, A VERY CUTE GIRL turns to Les' twin
text: sister, NATALIE -- she's conservative, bookish.
speaker_heading: CUTE GIRL
dialog: (low voice)
dialog: Does your brother have mono or
dialog: something? He slept through the
dialog: entire course.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: No, he's just brain dead.
text: The class empties. Mr. Gasket stands ominously above Les.
speaker_heading: MR. GASKET
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: Mr. Anderson.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MR. GASKET (cont'd)
dialog: It's punks like you the paramedics
text: end up scraping off the roads at
text: four in the morning.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: For your own sake and the safety of
dialog: others, I hope you fail your
dialog: driver's exam.
text: Les gets up to leave. Gasket signals to stay, then throws
text: him a piece of chalk. Les rolls his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNNY MEADOWS HIGH - DAY (BEGIN CREDITS)
text: Kids load into YELLOW SCHOOL BUSES and fancy cars.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: LINES. Blackboards full of "I WILL DRIVE SAFELY. I WILL
text: DRIVE SAFELY..." Les finishes his last one and flies out of
dialog: class.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNNY MEADOWS HIGH - DAY
text: Buses and cars begin to pull away.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
text: Deserted. Sprinting. Les slides to his locker and quickly
text: unlocks it. An avalanche of books and junk fall onto the
text: floor. He stuffs it back in.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNNY MEADOWS HIGH - DAY
text: A few kids here and there. Les bombs out of school, jamming
text: papers into his knapsack. He runs down the street after the
text: last departing school bus. He can't catch it. Natalie,
text: inside the bus, smiles at him. He stands in the middle of
text: the road, pissed. We hear a car racing towards him from
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: IT'S A RED FERRARI
text: The one from the dream. T-roof off. Music blares. MERCEDES
text: LANE, the leggy blonde girl from the dream, sits in the
text: passenger seat. PAOLO, her GQ Latin American boyfriend,
dialog: drives. They're in their own perfect world.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Les jumps out of the way as it screams by him. He watches
text: the Ferrari drive off.
text: We hear a bicycle tire SKIDDING along the pavement. He turns
dialog: to see:
text: A "nut case" on a ten speed stop his thirty foot skid a hair
text: away from Les' sneaker. This is DEAN, Les' best friend. He
text: has charm and mischief with a capital M written all over his
dialog: face.
text: They both look back at the Ferrari.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: You know, Dean, I can't help
dialog: wondering whether it'll ever get
dialog: that good for me.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Anderson, the only difference
dialog: between you and that greaseball, is
dialog: that he has a license and you
dialog: don't. In two days we open a whole
dialog: new chapter.
text: (motioning to his handle
dialog: bars)
dialog: Get in. I'll drive you home.
text: Les looks at Dean's BEAT TO SHIT death trap bike.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Unh, unh. Too much is at stake.
dialog: They'll never let me take my
dialog: driver's exam in traction.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Les, your license is as important
dialog: to me as it is to you. I'll take
dialog: it easy. I promise.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: White knuckles. Les hangs on as a sadistic Dean speeds along
text: the sidewalk. About to collide with a JOGGER, Dean cuts
dialog: onto:
speaker_heading: THE STREET
text: zigzagging in and out of TRAFFIC. A HONK here, a honk there.
text: Dean JOLTS the bike back up on the SIDEWALK.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Les tries to absorb the shock. Dean laughs, pedals faster.
text: He whips Les through:
scene_heading: LOW HANGING BRANCHES
text: They flap against Les' face. Dean's having a riot. Les
text: wants to start one. The torturous branches give way to:
scene_heading: LES' P.O.V. - A FEROCIOUS DOG CHAINED ON A PORCH
text: Dean has the bike headed straight for it. Its mouth
text: salivates. As Dean swerves Les by it, the dog runs and pulls
text: his chain taut, swinging out against an imaginary wall.
scene_heading: EXT. ANDERSON HOUSE - DEAN TURNS INTO THE DRIVEWAY
text: making sure to run Les through a SPRINKLER. This is Les'
text: house; large and colonial, its landscaping perfectly groomed.
text: Ahead of them, in front of the garage, there's an Audi 5000
text: Turbo. It's surrounded by mounds of dusty boxes and garage
text: junk. Dean slaloms through it.
scene_heading: EXT. ANDERSON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - A 1972 CADILLAC SEDAN
speaker_heading: DEVILLE
text: sits parked at an angle, barely squeezing in. Sky blue.
text: Gleaming chrome. It's in mint condition. Dean and Les ride
text: in. Dean jams on the brakes. Les slides painfully off the
text: handlebars. He gives Dean a dirty look. END OF CREDITS.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Just a painful reminder of what
dialog: you're leaving behind.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Whose Caddie?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: My grandfather's. Can you believe
dialog: it's sixteen years old? It only
text: has twenty thousand miles on it.
text: Dean gets off his bike and lets it crash to the ground.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (examining it)
dialog: It's intense. What's it doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: He's afraid to take it on long
dialog: trips so he borrowed my dad's car
dialog: for a week.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (opening the door)
dialog: I gotta tell you, Les, this boat
dialog: would kick-ass up at Archieâs. Do
dialog: you think we can get it for
dialog: Saturday night?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (o.s8.)
dialog: Not a chance in hell, Dean.
text: They turn. It's Les' DAD -- good-looking, early forties, he
text: wears grimy work clothes. He walks into the garage, removes
text: Dean's hand from the door, and buffs the chrome.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You have a better chance of winning
dialog: the Nobel Prize for physics than
dialog: you do of getting in this car.
text: Les looks at Dean as if to say "Does that answer your
dialog: question?"
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Hi Dad.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (to the boys)
dialog: How âbout a hand helping me move
dialog: this junk?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (picking up his bike)
dialog: I'd really love to, Mr. Anderson,
dialog: (a fake cough)
dialog: but I'm sort of allergic to dust
text: and cardboard boxes.
text: He coughs again. Dad doesn't even bother. Dean gets on his
dialog: bike.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (driving off)
dialog: See you tonight.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Dad? Do you think you could tell
dialog: me for sure if I can use Mom's car
dialog: Saturday night?
speaker_heading: DAD
text: (shoving a dusty box at
dialog: him)
dialog: Do me a favor, will ya, Les? Just
dialog: pass your driver's exam. And then
dialog: we'll talk.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN DINING AREA - NIGHT
text: Dad, Les, Natalie and Rudy sit at the table. Rudy is the
dialog: cute, ten year old brother you can only find in the movies.
text: As they munch away at their dinner, one by one they look up
dialog: in awe...
scene_heading: THEIR P.O.V. - MOM
text: Looking more like nine years pregnant, rather than nine
text: months, she carries the most humongous plate of mashed
text: potatoes, spotted with mini-pickles, chocolate chips and
text: potato chips. Instead of putting it in the center of the
text: table, she plops it down in front of her table setting.
text: With the family still looking on disgustedly, she picks up
text: the ketchup bottle, and starts squirting it out on her food
speaker_heading: (HAPPY FACE)...
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: For your information, this is
dialog: exactly what I ate when I was
dialog: pregnant with all of you.
text: She downs her first bite. It scares them back to their
dialog: meals.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Dad?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Unh, unh.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Did you get a chance to look at
dialog: those brochures?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (pulling a crumpled
text: brochure from his back
dialog: pocket)
dialog: Sure did.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Well? What do you think?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (flipping through it)
dialog: A twenty-three thousand dollar BMW
dialog: for a sixteen year old kid who's
dialog: never had a job in his life? I
dialog: think it's a great idea.
text: Les is humiliated.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Les, you only completed your
dialog: driver's ed course two hours ago.
dialog: You don't even have a license yet.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: But Dad, it wouldn't be just for
dialog: me. It would be for Natalie too.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Don't include me in your obsession.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Excuse me, Miss Mature. Is there
dialog: anything wrong with being American?
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: A BMW at sixteen? It's more like
dialog: spoiled. Karl says...
text: Everyone stops what they're doing ala E. F. Hutton.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: Can you people please be serious
dialog: for once in your life?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Karl says that in America the
dialog: people are misled to believe that a
dialog: car represents freedom and
dialog: individuality, when, in essence, it
dialog: is more oppressive than anything
dialog: else, burdening the individual with
dialog: materialistic costs, such as
dialog: insurance, gas and repairs.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Who cares what your Commie
dialog: boyfriend thinks? I think we'd all
dialog: prefer to be burdened with the cost
dialog: of an automobile, than with bread
dialog: lines and two year waiting lists
dialog: for a washing machine.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I agree.
text: Mother starts to boil.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: You two are so simple, it's
dialog: frightening.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Why are you even getting your
dialog: license?
speaker_heading: NATALIE
text: (upset and getting up from
dialog: the table)
dialog: I'm not hungry.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Natalie, if you prefer to eat
dialog: standing up, that's fine with me.
text: But nobody leaves the table until
dialog: we finish eating.
speaker_heading: NATALIE
dialog: This is the most oppressive
dialog: environment a child could be
dialog: subjected to.
text: Natalie sits down. We hear a loud HONK-HONK! Les stands up.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: (wiping his mouth)
dialog: That's for me.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You heard me Les. Whoever it is
dialog: will have to wait a few minutes.
speaker_heading: LES

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Les? Do you want to use my car
dialog: Saturday night?
text: Les sits down like he's playing musical chairs! The family
text: eats in silence. We hear another HONK, and then a couple of
text: quick HONKS, and then a HONNNKKK... The family tries to
text: ignore it, but it's more than annoying. It starts again:
scene_heading: EXT. ANDERSON HOUSE - INSIDE A RUSTED TWO-DOOR 48 DATSUN B-
speaker_heading: 210 - NIGHT
text: Hanging over, from the back to the front seat, leaning on the
text: horn is Dean. Dean's MOM and his LITTLE SISTER ride in
dialog: front. They're used to this behavior.
text: BACK IN THE DINING ROOM
text: The obnoxious HONKING continues. Everyone except Les has
text: stopped eating. Cheery, he munches away as if nothing is
text: going on. Mom and Dad boil. Dad has had it.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Les, if you're not out of this
dialog: house in five seconds, there's a
dialog: good chance you'll never drive
text: anything but a golf ball.
text: A victorious Les calmly excuses himself from the table.
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
text: Now this is a party. Loud music. Sixteen-year-old kids all
text: over the place. ALL THE GORGEOUS GIRLS AND GUYS huddle
text: around expensive SLICK DRIVING MACHINES, and competing car
dialog: stereos. If you happen to be a male without a car, you may
dialog: as well be at home with a Playboy.
text: The Datsun makes its way down the street.
scene_heading: INT. DEAN'S MOTHER'S DATSUN - NIGHT
text: An uncomfortable backseat, filled with junk. Les and Dean
text: sit squished together, practically eating their knees. The
text: front seat is pushed all the way back. Dean's little

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DEAN'S MOM
dialog: Is there something wrong with the

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: It's not the car, Ma. It's you,
dialog: you're driving. Just drop us off
text: around the corner.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CAR - AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT
text: As Dean and Les pull themselves out of the car, a GLOSSY
text: BLACK GTO, with a confederate flag attached to its antenna,
text: slows down across the street. Inside the GTO are THREE of
text: the scariest and rowdiest looking HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS you've
text: ever seen. They're laughing at the boys being dropped off by
dialog: mom.
speaker_heading: THE DRIVER
dialog: Hey boys, does Mommy drive you to
dialog: the little boys' room, also?
text: Les and Dean are crushed. As the derelicts drive away

text: "DUM, DUM, DaDUM... DUM, DaDUM, DaDUM, DaDUM."
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (to his mother)
dialog: Sorry, I didn't introduce you, Ma.

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: DEAN'S MOM
dialog: It's a school night, Dean. If
dialog: you're not standing here between
dialog: eleven and eleven o' two, I'm

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CHARLES

dialog: him.
scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
text: Les, Dean, and Charles sip fruit punch. They sit alone on

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I know exactly what you're
dialog: thinking, Les. I'm thinking the
dialog: same thing. I'm not sure about

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why am I so alone here? I'm good
dialog: looking, I've got a great sense of

speaker_heading: LES

dialog: (beat)
dialog: And on Saturday night, when we pull
dialog: into Archie's Atomic in your mom's
dialog: Audi 5000 TURBO, all this is going
dialog: to be at our fingertips. In fact,
dialog: Archie's makes this place look like
dialog: Sesame Street.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: To you Archie's makes the Playboy
text: Channel look like Sesame Street.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Archie's is the joint. I swear it.
dialog: My brother used to go there every

dialog: girls to guys is five to one. And
dialog: we're not talkin' dogs, we're
dialog: talkin' bunnies. The place is a
dialog: paradise.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm telling you, Les. The secret
dialog: to your happiness, and ultimately
dialog: our happiness, as long as we live
dialog: in this country, is a driver's

dialog: I've bumped into her a million
dialog: times, and she's never once bumped
dialog: into me.
text: Mercedes heads for them, arguing with her older looking
text: boyfriend, PAOLO. He looks very out of place.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: You don't own me, I can do whatever
dialog: I like. Women have rights in this
dialog: country. Not like Chile or
dialog: Argentina, where they worship their
dialog: men.
text: They barge through the boys as if they were a string of
text: beads. Les "quivers" beside Mercedes as she pours herself
dialog: some punch.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: PAOLO
dialog: It has nothing to do with worship,
dialog: it has to do with going to parties
dialog: with... with kids.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: I happen to go to school with these
dialog: kids. I have friends here.
speaker_heading: PAOLO
dialog: Friends? These children can do
dialog: nothing for you.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: (cold)
dialog: Can we just stop this discussion?
dialog: There are some things you and I
dialog: will never agree on.
speaker_heading: PAOLO
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Mercedes. I'm beginning to
dialog: perspire. You know I hate to
dialog: perspire.
dialog: (turning to go)
dialog: Are you coming?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: I think I can find my own way home,
dialog: thank you.
text: He walks away.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: And Paolo? If you're wondering
dialog: about Saturday night, I just
dialog: remembered...
speaker_heading: PAOLO
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: Don't do this to me, Mercedes.
dialog: You'll regret it.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: I've made other plans. I already
dialog: have a date.
speaker_heading: PAOLO
dialog: With who?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
text: With him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Mercedes turns to a shocked Les.
speaker_heading: PAOLO
dialog: Him?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: (to Les)
dialog: Didn't we make arrangements?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: I... I believe so. But, nothing
dialog: was final.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Well now they're final.
speaker_heading: PAOLO
dialog: You'll pay for this, Mercedes.
text: Paolo storms away. Les watches, afraid to speak. Mercedes
text: downs her punch. She fills her glass again, and downs it.
text: Les who? WE PUSH IN ON Les. He's in a daze.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNNY MEADOWS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: Kids pile out of class.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY
text: Dean and Charles get on the bus. Les stands on the curb.
text: The bus starts its engine. Fancy cars pull away.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I cannot believe you, Les. You're
dialog: blowing the greatest night of your
dialog: life for a girl who probably
dialog: doesn't even know you have a pulse.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Dean, believe it!
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (betrayed)
dialog: That's pathetic. After all these
dialog: years we finally get a chance to go
dialog: to Archie's, and now you're telling
dialog: me it's off?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: If Mercedes pulls through, you bet.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Why don't you just ask her, to make
dialog: sure?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: I'd love to Charles, but I can't
dialog: talk to something I can't see.
dialog: Last night was the closest any of
dialog: us have ever been to her.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well you're in luck, loverboy,
dialog: âcause she's sittin' down right
dialog: behind you.
text: Dean backs away. The bus doors slam closed in Les' face. He
dialog: turns around:
text: Mercedes sits on a bench about twenty-five feet away, reading
text: an ELLE magazine, sipping some apple juice.
text: Les turns back to the bus. It's pulling away.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (leaning out)
dialog: Go on, ask her. If you're lucky,
dialog: she'll bite.
text: Les turns back to Mercedes.
text: She's more beautiful than ever. He walks towards her. Her
text: blonde hair flutters in the wind. He stands beside her.
text: Some apple juice dribbles off her bottom lip. She tongues
text: her lips dry. It's the sexiest thing he's ever seen. He
dialog: can't even talk.
text: She glances up. Not recognizing him, she goes back to her
text: Magazine. We hear a LOUD HONK! HONK! !!!! It scares
dialog: Mercedes.
text: Les turns, shocked to see his father in the Cadillac, pulling
text: up in front of them. He HONKS again. It's the loudest horn
text: in the world. Les, embarrassed, ignores his father.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (rolling down the window)
dialog: Les?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The height of embarrassment. Les coolly walks by Mercedes.
text: Then, instead of getting into the car, he walks in front of
text: it, across the street. Dad rolls down the window, HONKING
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Les. It's me, your father.
text: Cringe. He tries to get out of her sight. Mercedes doesn't
text: even notice. Dad follows beside him, like the secret
dialog: service.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: What's going on, here, Les? Don't
dialog: you recognize me?
text: Still no answer. He turns the corner. So does Dad.
text: Finally, out of her sight, Les gets in.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CADILLAC - DAY
text: A WHITE INTERIOR, impeccably clean. The immensity of the car
text: dwarfs Les. We SEE BAGS OF PAMPERS in the back seat.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Is there something wrong with
dialog: having a father, these days?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Dad, what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I ran some errands for your mom,
dialog: and I thought I'd come by and take
dialog: you driving. I figured if you could
dialog: handle this cruiser you could
dialog: handle anything.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: But what about Grandpa?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Don't worry about Grandpa. Who
dialog: knows what he's doing with my car?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Okay.
text: Dad slides over. Les climbs into the driver's seat, moving
text: it way up close.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He checks his mirrors then takes a deep breath. He puts his
text: flicker on, then pulls out, very slowly... cautiously.
text: Immediately, the car screeches to a halt fifteen feet before
text: a stop sign.
text: Dad rubs his neck.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Sorry. The brakes are a little
dialog: sensitive.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - DAY
text: Les smoothly turns the Cadillac off a busy street into a
dialog: residential neighborhood.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CADILLAC - DAY
text: Les, driving for a while now, begins to get the hang of it.
text: He stops smoothly at a stop sign. Suddenly, he stares wide-
text: eyed, frozen.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: That's a long enough stop. Make a
dialog: right here.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: What's the matter?
text: Up the block, Les sees Mercedes Lane.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: I have to ask you a favor. You can
dialog: say no, but I'll never ask you
dialog: another one as long as I live.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Les, you know that's a lie.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: You see that girl up ahead? Her
dialog: name is Mercedes Lane. To put it
dialog: simply, if she asked me to marry
dialog: her tomorrow, I'd definitely say
dialog: yes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (excited)
dialog: So. Let's drive by her.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Dad, she just asked me out last
dialog: night. If I drive by with you in
dialog: the car, she'll never look at me
dialog: again. Even if I were standing on
text: her chest.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You're asking me to let you drive
dialog: this car, alone? Without a
dialog: license? Are you insane?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: I'll just drive by, say hello and
dialog: circle back. It'll take two
dialog: minutes.
text: Dad, sizing up the situation, looks at Les, then at Mercedes
text: who walks farther up the block.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: (earnestly)
dialog: I just want to see if she was
dialog: serious.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (with a big heart)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: And Dad...
dialog: (looking at groceries)
dialog: Would you mind?
dialog: What can Dad say? He gets out, with the Pampers, then
text: watches Les pull away.
scene_heading: LES' P.O.V. - APPROACHING MERCEDES
text: He rolls down the window and honks. She turns, gives hima
text: dirty look, and keeps walking. He shadows her.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Mercedes?
text: She stops and looks inside, puzzled.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Les Anderson, from the party last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Oh, you scared me. I didn't
dialog: recognize you. Some jerk honked at
dialog: me a little while ago in a car just
dialog: like this.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: You live around here, don't you?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
text: Unh, unh. Just up the street.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Hop in, I'll give you a lift?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Sure, that'd be fun.
text: As she's about to open the front door:
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Wait a second.
text: Les jumps out of the car, runs around the passenger side, and
text: insists she get in the back seat. Charmed, she does.
speaker_heading: DAD
text: down the road, shakes his head in
dialog: disbelief.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Adjusting the rearview mirror, Les momentarily holds on her
text: chest, then up to her face. He smiles. He sees Dad, in the
text: mirror, holding the bags.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Which house is yours?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
text: It's right down the block.
text: He drives up half a block.

speaker_heading: LES
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
text: Into Cedarbrook, to a friend's
dialog: place. You don't mind, do you?
text: Les is stunned, caught completely off guard. He looks at

speaker_heading: REARVIEW MIRROR
text: His father, still holding the bags, stands alone.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: No, not at all.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - DAY

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: (courageous)

dialog: mentioned something about you and I
dialog: going out Saturday night. I was
dialog: just curious... Are we still on?
dialog: She doesn't have the heart.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Sure... Call me, tomorrow.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: (pulling out a pen)
dialog: Great, let me give you my number in
dialog: case something comes up. You never
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: (handing him her Elle

speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Thanks again for the lift, Les.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: No problem.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CADILLAC - LATER
text: Les coasts down the street like a cop on surveillance.
text: Suddenly, he spots Dad a block ahead, carrying the huge
text: grocery bags. His jacket is off and his shirt is soaked in
dialog: sweat.
text: As Les pulls up, Dad glares at him. If looks could kill.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM AND DEN - DAY
text: Les sits stiffly, in a chair. Dad disheveled, his shirt

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DAD (cont'd)
dialog: You gave me your word and you used
dialog: up your last favor? Do you realize
dialog: where this leaves you?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Not in good shape, but just let me
dialog: explain. I admit I should never
text: have let her in the car, but she
dialog: lived three houses down. I thought
dialog: I was taking her home.
dialog: (leoking at Mom)
dialog: Mom, I'm sure there were many
dialog: similar romantic gestures when Dad
dialog: was dating you.
text: Mom lies on her side in the den wearing a workout outfit,
text: doing scissor-kick exercises, to a pregnancy video. If Moby
dialog: Dick were a pregnant woman living in America, she'd look like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: I don't know. There must have
dialog: been. We're married.
text: Mom smiles. Dad looks at her as if to say, "Thanks a lot."
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Why didn't you just tell her the
dialog: truth?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Tell Mercedes Lane I don't have a
dialog: license? And risk her having a
dialog: heart attack from laughing so hard?
dialog: Put yourself in my shoes.
text: Dad looks at Les. Then to Mom for help. Forget it, Dad,
dialog: you're on your own.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (giving in)
dialog: Well, consider yourself lucky that

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Relax, I didn't get caught.
dialog: (pinning the picture over
dialog: his desk)
dialog: And you'd do the same.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now did you guys come over to ask
dialog: me some questions? Because if you
dialog: didn't, then I have some studying
dialog: to do.
text: A tense silence. Les hands Charles the Driver's Ed book.
text: Through the walls, the classical music builds in intensity.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: All right. How can you identify a
dialog: blind pedestrian to whom you must
dialog: yield the right of way?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You're not serious.
speaker_heading: LES
text: By their white cane, or guard dog.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: This is a complete waste of time.
dialog: You know your stuff, Les. You've

scene_heading: EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MERCEDES

speaker_heading: LES

speaker_heading: MERCEDES
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: It's a tow zone.
speaker_heading: MERCEDES

speaker_heading: LES
dialog: Hey, come on, I'm with her.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN

scene_heading: INT. EL RAY'S - BAR/FOYER NIGHT

dialog: first drink.
text: She approaches Paolo. He sees her.
speaker_heading: PAOLO
dialog: (feigned charm)
dialog: Mercedes, what a lovely surprise.
dialog: Where is your high school 'throb

speaker_heading: INSIDE EL RAYâS

scene_heading: OUTSIDE EL RAY'S
text: Les waits for Mercedes. She stomps by him, back to the car,
text: swigging the near-full bottle of champagne. Les turns to
dialog: see...
text: THE TOW TRUCK, about to pull away with the Caddie. Blindly,
text: Les, runs across the street. Cars screech and swerve. He

speaker_heading: REDNECK DRIVER
dialog: Get out the way, boy.
speaker_heading: LES

speaker_heading: LES

speaker_heading: REDNECK DRIVER
dialog: For eighty dollars?

speaker_heading: MERCEDES

speaker_heading: LES

speaker_heading: MERCEDES

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
text: The car bounces along on a steep, narrow dirt mountain road
text: more suited for a horse or a 4x4.
dialog: Whatever it is, it's not good for the car. Mercedes has

dialog: giggly âexcuse me.â
scene_heading: THEIR POV - STRAIGHT AHEAD
text: Bit by bit, the trees vanish. There's nothing but stars.
text: The entire city sits below us, glowing like an expensive
text: breach. It's a glorious sight. Les stops the car.
text: They get out. Mercedes, clutching her now three quarters
text: empty bottle of champagne, stares up at the stars. Mercedes
text: is more than light headed. She's drunk. Les checks the
text: condition of the car. It looks fine.

scene_heading: LES' P.O.V. - A ROW OF CASSETTES

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: DEAN

scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BOOTH - NIGHT
text: Tiny and sleazy. Les and Dean's reflection CAN BE SEEN in

dialog: LES RUNS UP THE RAMP
text: and gets inside the car. The interior is so white, it's

text: WITH THE BOYS - WALKING UP TO ORDER
text: Chrome glistens. You can see your reflection on every

speaker_heading: LES

speaker_heading: WOMAN.
speaker_heading: LES

speaker_heading: BARTENDER

speaker_heading: LES
dialog: How 'bout something with a little
text: body... something with some heat on
dialog: it.
text: Challenged, the Bartender reaches under the bar, and pulls up
text: a three quarter's full bottle of the Devil's mouth wash.
text: There's no label on it, only a FIVE-INCH WORM rests on the
text: bottom. The Bartender pours hima glass. Everyone gathers
text: around him, the dropouts as well.
text: Beads of sweat dot Les' forehead. Sixteen years, all coming
text: down to this moment. Coolly, he pushes the glass aside.
text: CONFUSION. He grabs the bottle. The crowd GASPS! Oddly, he
text: pours the alcohol into his hand, through his fingers. It
text: spills onto the bar, until he's left holding THE WORM in the
text: palm of his hand.
text: He takes the worm between his thumb and index finger, tilts
text: his head back, and in one motion drops it into his mouth and
text: swallows. INSTANT RESPECT. A ROAR OF APPROVAL. Within
text: seconds the music is back on and the place returns to
dialog: "normal."
text: Proudly, Les spins to look out at all his new friends, only
text: to see the DROPOUTS menacingly surround him.
speaker_heading: THE DRIVER
dialog: Step outside, worm, we've got a job
dialog: to finish.
dialog: Les looks around for help. Forget it. In a joint like this

text: who does he see holding the glass? The driver with his two
text: buddies on either side of him.
text: The Beast winds up and nails the driver, sending the three
text: dropouts flying onto a table full of beers. As a MACK TRUCK

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAWN
text: Sorry, Dad, no car in sight. The garage door inches open.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAWN
text: Dad helps Mom along, TWO STEPS AWAY FROM THE GARAGE. She
dialog: looks better. He's the crazy one.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: One more second, we're almost
dialog: there.
text: He swings the garage door open, without looking inside.
text: Behind him, it's empty. He's about to swing her around,
dialog: BUT...
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I'm okay.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Gas? Are you sure? The car's
dialog: right here.
text: Dad glances into the garage.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I'm positive. It must have been
dialog: the herring.
dialog: (feeling guilty)
dialog: I feel terrible.
text: Dad, about to close the door, notices something.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: What's the matter?
scene_heading: INSIDE THE GARAGE
text: Even with the emergence of daylight, it's still too dark to
dialog: notice the condition of the Caddie.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Why is the garage door open?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Maybe Natalie left it open?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Why would she? She took the Audi.
scene_heading: DAD'S P.O.V. - OUTSIDE THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE
text: He sees the Audi is not back. Then he notices the hedges...
text: Locking around, he spots the tire tracks. Shock.
speaker_heading: MOM
text: stands at the lip of the garage, watches. Suddenly... she
text: doubles over in pain.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Richard.
text: Forget it. He's in a trance.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Richard!
text: Dad turns and sees her hunched over. He runs to her aid.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (walking her to the car)
dialog: Okay, honey. Just try and breathe
dialog: normally. We'll be at the hospital
dialog: in a few...
text: Everything stops; his feet, his voice, his heart... As he
text: walks around the car we can hear his blood boiling.
text: The bumpers. The hubcaps. THE BACK WINDOW! Dad puts his
text: hand through it, unbelieving. He examines the severed
text: antenna, the mutilated wipers, then looks into the car.
scene_heading: DAD'S P.O.V. - LES LYING ON THE FLOOR
text: hiding, looking him straight in the eye. A frightened puppy.
speaker_heading: DAD
text: Ready to explode. Les slithers out the opposite door, away
dialog: from Dad, beside Mom.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Is there something wrong with your
dialog: bed, Les?
text: Les can't speak. Dad walks around the car. Les goes the
text: other way. They circle. Mom stands in between them, leaning
text: against the car. She doesn't look well, but there's no
dialog: stopping Dad.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Would you mind explaining to me

dialog: this?

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you have any notion of what
dialog: you've done this evening? What
dialog: this means to your future in this
dialog: house and on this planet?
text: They're still on opposite sides. Rudy appears at
text: door to the house, wearing his pajamas.
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: I have a feeling.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Les, you couldn't even begin to
dialog: imagine what's in store for you.
dialog: We had a college fund set aside for
dialog: you.
dialog: (glancing at the Caddie)
dialog: That's gone. You had free room and
dialog: board, two trusting parents, anda
dialog: social life. That's gone. You had
text: a TV, a stereo, a baseball glove, a
text: tennis racket, a skateboard, a
dialog: bicycle. That's all gone. You
dialog: even had sunlight and a window in
dialog: your room. That's history. I'm
dialog: boarding the window up tomorrow.
dialog: And communication with the outside
dialog: world? You can forget about that.
dialog: It's all gone.
speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Frankly, Les, I don't see what's
dialog: left... other than school and two

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: LES

dialog: you try, you can't imagine what
dialog: I've learned tonight.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Please let me drive, Dad. I can do
dialog: it.
text: Dad thinks about it... He hands Les the keys, gripping his
text: hand tight.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (right up to his face)
dialog: All right, but try and drive like
dialog: you have a license.
text: Dad lets go of Les' hand and jumps in the back with Mom.
text: Rudy rides shotgun. Les buckles in.
scene_heading: THE MANGLED CADDIE

dialog: away.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CADDIE

scene_heading: INT. POLICE PHONE BOOTH - DAY

speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Don't you feel invigorated? This

text: She walks away, leaving a stunned, and at last, speechless
dialog: Karl.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Full speed ahead. NOT A SINGLE CAR IN SIGHT. The light
text: turns yellow, then a quick red. The Caddie's wheels lock. A
text: lennnnnng skid. Burnt rubber, as it screeches to a stop.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CADDIE
text: Rudy, Mom, and Dad, REBOUND from the sudden stop.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (pissed off)
dialog: Les? What the hell are you doing?
text: There's not a damn car in sight.
speaker_heading: LES
text: It's a red light.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Les. We're rushing your mother to
text: the hospital, not a bridge game.
dialog: Go through it! Just get us there.
text: Les smiles, looks both ways, then tries to take off... Only
text: one problem: the engine is revving, but the Caddie's not
dialog: moving.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: I don't know. I'm pressing on the
dialog: gas, but it won't go anywhere.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It sounds like the transmission.
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Try the other gears.
text: Les tries them all. Nothing. Shifting into park, the car
text: JOLTS BACKWARDS as he passes REVERSE.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: (looking at Dad)
dialog: Only reverse works.
text: Dad doesn't like it. Mom is in more pain. She winces and
text: groans. Dad feels for her.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Alright, alright. But take it
dialog: easy.
text: Les loves it. He shifts into reverse, turns to look through
text: the back window, braces his arm behind the seat, and takes
dialog: off.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE CADDIE
text: Popeye Doyle screeches the car around and peels away.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS - DAY
text: The Caddie, in reverse, bombs down the street, its right turn
text: signal on. In the left lane is a long WEDDING PROCESSION.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CADDIE
text: Mom is in great pain. Les has to make the turn. He zips up
text: to the front of the line, then makes a sweeping left turn
text: from the middle lane, and because an OLD BLIND WOMAN is
text: shuffling across the street, Les is forced to go up ons:
speaker_heading: THE SIDEWALK
text: Boxed in by parked cars, the Caddie bombs through Sunday
text: papers and Sunday morning brunch tables. A WAITER putting a
text: RED tablecloth down on a table dives out of the way, like a
text: Matador teasing a bull. The Caddie flies through the
text: tablecloth.
text: A MOTORCYCLE COP ACROSS THE STREET
text: writing out a parking ticket, drops his pencil when he sees
text: the Caddie crash down off the sidewalk onto the street
text: joining the traffic. The Cop jumps on his motorcycle,
text: switches on his siren, and rockets away.
scene_heading: WITH THE CADDIE
text: weaving in and out of traffic: left turns, right turns, it's
text: incredible. We hear the SIREN. The Cop pulls up beside Les,
text: waving for him to pull over.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Dad tries to signal to the Cop that Mom's pregnant. The Cop
text: realizes what's going on. He waves for Les to "follow him,"
text: but he hasn't been looking ahead. Suddenly, his front tire
text: hits the back bumper of an ANTIQUE CONVERTIBLE. The Cop
text: somersaults over his handle bars into the car's front seat.
text: The DRIVER, a red-nosed Irishman, does a double-take, takes a
text: leck at the flask he's been nipping on, smiles, and takes
text: another swig.
text: BACK WITH THE CADDIE
text: bulleting down the street. The hospital is in sight. Les
text: has to catch a yellow light. A WATER MAIN has burst.
text: There's a HUGE PUDDLE. IN REVERSE, Les rockets through the
dialog: light. Here comes the puddle... Has he learned his lesson?
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CADDIE
text: Les eases his foot off the brake and coasts through. Spray
text: shoots out on either side, and SPLASHES through the back
text: window, soaking Mom and Dad. Rudy loves it. Dad alternates
text: between caring for Mom and fearing for his life.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: Down the street from the hospital. Natalie leaves the
text: precinct. She does a triple-take when she sees her family
text: flash by backwards. She runs after them.
dialog: SUDDENLY!!!
text: A HUGE TRUCK backs out of a SKYSCRAPER CONSTRUCTION SITE. A
text: TOWERING CRANE attempts to lift a HEAVY LOAD OF STEEL GIRDERS
text: from the truck's flatbed. The girders hang out onto the
dialog: street...
text: The Caddie's headed straight for them. We hear a SCREECH!
scene_heading: EXT. CADILLAC - CLOSE ON THEIR FACES IN THE BACK WINDOW
dialog: Horror, as there's nothing they can do, except pray... ten
text: feet, five feet, a foot... Les swoops the car safely around
text: the girders and then screeches to a stop in a tow zone, in
text: front of the hospital. The emergency driveway is clogged.
text: Natalie runs to the car.
text: TWO ORDERLIES dash out to the car with a WHEELCHAIR. Dad
text: helps Mom out. Rudy and Natalie watch. Les stays in the
text: car. They rush Mom up the walk into the hospital. Dad looks
text: back. Les is standing by the destroyed Caddie, ashamed.

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (stern)
dialog: Come here, Les.

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Les. Come here!

dialog: him.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Where did you learn to drive like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: LES
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: I don't know, Dad. TI guess last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: It must have been some crash
dialog: course.
text: Les laughs. Dad squeezes him, affectionately. The CAMERA
text: CRANES UP TO a bird's-eye view, high above the scene. Dad,
text: with his arm around his son, disappears into the hospital.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (voice over)
dialog: Maybe we can fix the car before
dialog: Grandfather gets home. He'll never
dialog: notice.
text: Suddenly, CONSTRUCTION WORKERS begin shouting, and then
text: running for cover, scattering like ants. From the sky:
scene_heading: THE WHOLE BUNCH OF GIRDERS
text: CRASH down on Grandfather's Cadillac, DEMOLISHING it.
text: As the dust settles, the CAMERA CRAWLS its way into the heap
text: of junk until we CAN BARELY MAKE OUT the radio-tape deck. We
text: hear a click-click. The tape starts to play... Sinatra
