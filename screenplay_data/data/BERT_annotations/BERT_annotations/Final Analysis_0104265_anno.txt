text: A SEA OF FACES. Twisted, Contorted. Mouths open wide -~
text: black holes, screaming. But silently: these SHOTS are MOS.

speaker_heading: cuT To:
scene_heading: INT. GIANT STADIUM - NIGHT

dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. WELFARE HOTEL - SAME TIME
text: A filthy little room somewhere in the South Bronx. The Crazy
text: Man stands on a mattress, the gun still in his mouth. At his
text: feet a Girl is curled, her wrists slashed. TWO COPS stand in

speaker_heading: cOP 1
dialog: Put it down. Slow.
text: The Crazy Man slides the gun out of his mouth. Lets it fall

text: THREE FANS leap up, in their seats. All in their late 30's.
text: MIKE O'BRIEN, an ursine Public Defender with fiery eyes;
text: ALAN LOWENTHAL, a meticulous, conservative psychiatrist; and
dialog: in between them:
text: ISAAC BARR, another psychiatrist, somewhat less meticulous
dialog: and conservative.
text: Through the din, Isaac realizes that his beeper is BEEPING.
scene_heading: BENEATH THE STANDS
text: As Isaac moves past the hot dog vendors toward the nearest
text: exit. Beneath the cantilevered rows of stands, he passes a
text: strange, skinny MAN who spasmodically jerks -- a marionette
text: going cold turkey -~ to the rise and fall of the fans’ ROAR.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - NIGHT (MOVING)
text: Isaac has pulled an electric shaver from his briefcase. He
text: runs it over his cheeks as the cab hurtles downtown.
text: It’s hard to get an even shave, as the cab drops into deep
text: potholes and bounces out again.
text: Now he stuffs the shaver back into his case as the cab pulls
text: up in front of Bellevue Hospital.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: I used to be in there. They threw me
dialog: out. That was wrong. I shouldn’t be
dialog: driving this cab, I’m a crazy person.
text: As Isaac hands over the fare:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Y'have to be crazy to drive a cab...
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOLDING AREA ~- SAME TIME
text: feeming with loud, angry lunatics. Every seat is taken, even
text: a couple of stretchers.
text: Guarded by a bored and hulking C.0., a NURSE takes the pulse
text: of the handcuffed Crazy Man.
speaker_heading: CRAZY MAN
dialog: There’s no need for that. My pulse
dialog: rate is twenty.
dialog: c.o.
dialog: Sounds more like your IQ.
text: Provoked, the Crazy Man springs at the big C.O. The C.O.
text: steps back and whallops the Crazy man with a ham~fist.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON WARD ENTRANCE ~ NIGHT
text: Isaac reaches the first of three heavy steel gates with the
text: emblem "N.¥.C. Department of Corrections" bolted to it.
speaker_heading: ESAAC
dialog: Crack the gate!
scene_heading: INT. HOLDING AREA - A MINUTE LATER
text: Crazy Man is being guarded now by TWO C.0.’s. A fresh bruise
text: on his cheek.
text: Isaac, entering, immediately notices the bruise. He and the
text: c.0.’s trade tense looks. Now, soft but emphatic:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: We’1ll be okay.
dialog: c.0. 2
dialog: Your call.
text: Reluctantly, the two C.0.’s exit.
text: Isaac sits on the bench opposite Crazy Man, who regards him
text: with cold, slitted eyes.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Do you understand that you’re ina
dialog: hospital, and that it’s a special kind
dialog: of hospital?
text: The Crazy Man just glares.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: It’s a prison. Do you understand that
dialog: you're going to be charged?
speaker_heading: CRAZY MAN
dialog: I’m already charged, with ions from
dialog: Bantar.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: "Bantar"?
speaker_heading: CRAZY MAN
dialog: The planet.
speaker_heading: ITsaAAC
dialog: What I mean is, do you understand why
dialog: you’re here?
speaker_heading: CRAZY MAN
dialog: To prepare for the landing. This
dialog: facility will make a suitable
dialog: headquarters.
text: Isaac considers this. It doesn’t make sense.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: you'd think they’d want something
text: closer to midtown.
text: Crazy Man stares at Isaac. Now, the hint of a smile.
speaker_heading: CRAZY MAN
dialog: You've been to Bantar, haven’t you?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Only on business.
scene_heading: INT. NURSING STATION ~ NIGHT - LATER
text: Isaac raids the med closet as a pretty duty nurse (FRANKLIN)
text: makes notations in her charts.
speaker_heading: NURSE FRANKLIN
dialog: Guy psycho or whacked out on dope?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I’1l hedge my bets. Both.
text: He finds what he’s looking for: Maalox. As he swigs:
speaker_heading: NURSE FRANKLIN
dialog: We've stashed some Chardonnay in the
text: fridge, behind the urine samples and
text: tetanus toxoid.
text: Isaac doesn’t pick up on the offer. Franklin tries again.
speaker_heading: NURSE FRANKLIN
dialog: Robert’s out of town till Wednesday ...
text: A beat, then Isaac snaps shut Crazy Man/’s chart.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Really? Maybe tomorrow night ... But TI
dialog: don’t know -~ I’ve got this thing ...
text: Franklin nods: this thing. Great. And Isaac hurries out.
speaker_heading: cuUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ISAAC'S BUILDING ~ LATE NIGHT
text: A brownstone on 19th off Broadway. Isaac has the lower two
text: floors, and the basement office.
text: He steps out of a cab, in front of a huge hairy HOMELESS MAN
text: warming himself by a garbage can -~- its contents are afire.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: Hey Doc. Would you consider loaning me
dialog: five-thousand dollars?
text: Isaac hands him a pile of change, then hurries to his door.
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC'S LIVING ROOM ~ LATE NIGHT
text: Isaac turns on a light, on a dimmer, very low. our first
dialog: impression is of books, everywhere. And second, of the sorts
dialog: of fixtures and furnishings a bachelor would have,
text: unaccountably mixed with older, worn items from another era.
text: A dark, older WOMAN steps into the room. She’s been knitting
text: a sweater. They speak softly.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: Everything’s fine. She’s fast asleep.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Thanks, Maria. Let me call you a cab.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (MARIA)
dialog: I’ll do it.
text: She goes to the phone. Isaac crosses, into:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: A LADY, not that old, but frail, her body slightly bowed, is
text: tucked in bed. Her features are relaxed, blank ... but there
text: is an intelligence, somehow, in her eyes. Her eyes are open.
text: Isaac sits on the couch opposite the bed. Quietly:
speaker_heading: TSAAC
text: Got beeped at the game. Missed the end
dialog: «+. Just gets worse at the hospital ...
text: The city’s at war. A war in the head,
dialog: in people’s heads, and we‘re losing.
text: Isaac’s mother doesn’t respond. It doesn’t seem as though
text: she can hear him. Nevertheless he continues to "converse".
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I‘ll be home all morning ...
text: He nods down at the floor, signifying the floor below.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Private patients. I know, I know, but
dialog: it just piles up ...
dialog: (remembers)
dialog: «es then court, tomorrow afternoon.
text: We HEAR the night nurse letting herself out. Isaac stands,
text: crosses to his mother’s bedside. Strokes her forehead.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Okay, okay. I promise I’11 slow down.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC’S OFFICE ~ EARLY AFTERNOON
text: Quiet and austere. Black blinds block the view. The desk is
text: made of two filing cabinets and a marble top. There’s an
text: Eames chair opposite the desk chair and a black leather couch
text: opposite the Eames chair. Isaac sits in the Eames chair.
text: OFF-SCREEN, we hear the VOICE of a young WOMAN.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (OS)
dialog: -.. Ifve had the dream again.
text: Lying on the couch is DIANA BAYLOR, mid-20’s. Very pretty,
text: but pale and thin. In drab clothes and schoolgirl bangs.
text: Clearly much of the session has already passed: her eyes are
text: closed, her body limp.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I’m arranging flowers on a table ... as
dialog: a centerpiece ...
text: Isaac watches as she twists on the couch, causing her skirt
text: to hike up ever higher on her thighs.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I decorate the flowerpot with fancy
dialog: paper ...
text: Suddenly her eyelids roll wide open, like a doll’s.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: By the way, my sister --
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Wait. Let’s go back to your dream.
dialog: Tell me more about the flowers.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: There’s nothing more to tell.
text: She swings her feet over the side of the couch and sits up.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: My sister still wants to talk to you.
dialog: She thinks she knows some things about
dialog: Mom and Dad that might shed some light.
text: Isaac glances at his clock: As he suspected, end of session.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Maybe these are things we’d do better
dialog: to uncover in our work here, Diana.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: She’s paying for this, Dr. Barr.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Why don’t we discuss how that makes you
dialog: feel in our next session?
text: Diana hesitates, then stands. As she starts toward the door:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: And try to be on time, please.
text: Diana turns. Explains:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It’s not me, it’s the stove.
text: Isaac looks at her.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Whenever I leave my apartment, I have
dialog: to go back to be sure the stove’s off.
dialog: Then after I check it, I have to go
dialog: back to be sure the pilot light didn’t
text: blow out when I closed the oven door.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: That’s why you were late today?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I went back thirteen times.
text: She stands there, awaiting a response from Isaac. Finally:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: It could be ... that you perform this
dialog: ritual in order to be late.
text: Diana looks confused.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: To put people off. Make them "give up"
dialog: on you. As a way of avoiding intimacy.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You mean I’m "passive aggressive" ...
text: Isaac stands. Calmly, firmly, as he shows her to the door:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: We’ll get into it on Thursday.
dialog: 8.
text: He gently closes the door on her. Then bolts to his desk --
dialog: he’s late! --
text: Isaac madly grabs at a bunch of papers, and thrusts them into
dialog: his briefcase --
dialog: cur To:
scene_heading: INT. GYPSY CAB - AFTERNOON
text: Speeding up to 16ist Street. Past half-demolished housing
text: developments and bombed-out storefronts. Beirut, the Bronx.
text: Isaac alternately reviews his papers and stares out at the
text: devastation. His knee jiggles. As they stop at a red light:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Don’t be mean, turn to green.
text: A chant he’s used since he was young. The light stays red.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Don’t be mean, turn to gr--
text: The CABBIE jumps the red light and goes SCREECHING through an
text: intersection, just missing two others cars.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Take it easy!
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: You said you were inna hurry!
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I was kidding.
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRONX SUPREME COURT - AFTERNOON
text: In the back, Legal Aid Lawyers try to convince various pimps,
text: prostitutes, dope dealers, motorcycle punks, to cop pleas.
text: Isaac, on the witness stand, is being cross-examined.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT D.A.
text: This is a schizophrenic patient who may
dialog: suffer a relapse in the future. Isn’t
dialog: that true?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I don’t agree that Pepe Carrero suffers
text: from a schizophrenic illness.
dialog: (more)
speaker_heading: ISAAC (Cont‘d)
dialog: Nonetheless the prognostic indicators
dialog: of what you call a "relapse" are:
dialog: Previous hospitalization? Pepe was not
text: previously hospitalized. Gradual onset
dialog: of the illness? His onset was abrupt,
dialog: acute. Lingering symptoms? Pepe has
dialog: had a rapid reorganization.
text: Pepe, small and scared, sits at the defense table in borrowed
text: clothes that are too big for him, beside his lawyer, O’Brien.
speaker_heading: MS. KAUFMAN
dialog: You don’t feel that this man, who
text: murdered his male lover with scissors,
dialog: should be held in a secure facility?
dialog: For our safety, if not for his own?
speaker_heading: QO’ BRIEN
dialog: Objection! Your Honor, our safety
dialog: isn’t the issue here --
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I'd like to answer the question.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: A maximum security state hospital --
dialog: what you call a "secure facility" -- is
text: in fact a human warehouse. There’s no
dialog: psychotherapy offered, only chemical
dialog: restraints. And once a patient is
dialog: committed, who knows how long he’1l be
dialog: held there? Five years? Ten? Will he
dialog: be a human time bomb when he’s
dialog: released? No, Pepe will be safer ina
dialog: civil psychiatric treatment center.
dialog: And if he’s safe, we’ll be safe too.
dialog: curt TO:
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE ROTUNDA - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Crowded with the accused, their lawyers and relatives. Isaac
text: and O’Brien make their way through the mob, to the street.
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
dialog: Score another upset win! We/’re a
dialog: fucking demonic team, you and me.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: True.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: O’BRIEN
dialog: So why are you so fucking ecstatic?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I dunno ... Suppose Pepe slips through
dialog: the system. It’s been known to happen.
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
text: Pokes another boyfriend with pinking
dialog: shears?
text: Suddenly Isaac notices, across the entrance hall, a stunning
text: WOMAN who seems to be peering through the crowd at him.
text: She’s fair, early 30’s, and couldn’t look more out of place.
speaker_heading: O’BRIEN
dialog: Hey, that’s Pepe’s problem. We won,
dialog: tke my man. Now we gonna celebrate.
text: Now the Woman is obscured by an oversized pair of Bikers ...
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I’m gonna go home. Eat with my mother.
speaker_heading: O’BRIEN
dialog: Hey, Gretschen could feed her tonight.
text: Isaac nods at his beeper.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: I’m on call.
text: O’Brien grabs Isaac's beeper off his belt. Waves it.
speaker_heading: O’BRIEN
dialog: Y'know who wears beepers these days?
dialog: Crack dealers.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (grabs it back)
dialog: And doctors.
text: He clips it on his belt again. Then looks up, trying to find
text: the stunning Woman. But she’s vanished, now.
speaker_heading: O’/BRIEN
dialog: (scolds)
dialog: Only people you hang out with are guys
dialog: that rape their grandmothers.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
text: After decapitating them.
dialog: il.
text: They exit the courthouse, and Isaac flags a gypsy cab.
dialog: curt TO:
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC'S VESTIBULE - EVENING (LATER)
text: Isaac unlocks his mailbox. Removes his mail, and scans it.
text: He seems to be looking for one particular letter.
text: He finds what he’s looking for, rips open the envelope.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Yes.
text: Then pulls out his many keys, and starts to unlock the front
text: door when he hears, behind him:
speaker_heading: WOMAN (0.S.)
dialog: -- Dr. Barr?
text: Isaac turns to find the Woman from the courthouse. Her
text: rather sensational figure, he now sees, is wrapped in a
text: tight-fitting Romeo Gigli suit that seems made for her.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I’m Heather Evans -- Diana Baylor’s
dialog: sister. I left a few messages on your
dialog: machine.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I’ve been in court. Didn’t I -- see
dialog: you there?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I wanted to speak with you alone. And
dialog: the man you were with? I thought maybe
dialog: -- I don’t know, that he might’ve been
dialog: some kind of ... patient, or something.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: O’Brien? He‘’s crazy, but nobody’s had
dialog: him committed yet.
text: Her limpid eyes fixed on Isaac, Heather waits for him to say
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Well ... come in for a second ...
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC'S APARTMENT ~ NIGHT
text: As they enter, Heather takes in the several walls of books.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You've read them all ..?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Oh, those. My decorator buys them by
dialog: the pound.
text: He uncertainly glances at Heather, who’s taken Modern Man In
text: Search Of A Soul off the shelf.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Would you excuse me a minute?
scene_heading: INT. BACK BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Isaac’s mother is propped up in bed. GRETSCHEN, the tough-
text: looking but attractive day nurse, is spoon-feeding her.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Gretsch, Could you stay another hour?
text: She looks up at him. Smiles.
speaker_heading: GRETSCHEN
dialog: I could stay all night.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Oh ... Okay. Yeah. Good.
text: He takes the spoon from her hand, starts to feed his mother.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Mom, my paper ... It’s been accepted
dialog: for presentation at the next Academy of
dialog: Psychiatry and Law Conference.
text: Isaac’s mother silently finishes her soup.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I know it’s not that big a deal ... But
dialog: everything helps when you’re not board
dialog: certified ...
text: He hands the spoon back to Gretschen. Tells his mother:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I’ve got somebody waiting. A patient’s
dialog: sister. I/’11 talk to you later.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Heather slides the Jung volume back onto the shelf.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Who were you talking to?
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (a little embarrassed)
dialog: My mother.
text: Heather laughs.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Are you into taxidermy too?
text: Isaac looks quizzical -- he doesn’t get it.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Norman Bates ~-?
text: Now Isaac laughs.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: No, my mother’s quite real. Though I
dialog: guess Norman would’ve said the same.
text: Now Heather notices Gretschen, standing in the doorframe of
text: the back bedroom. Appraising her.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Could we possibly go somewhere else?
dialog: To talk?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOCAL COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
text: Isaac and Heather are in a booth, sipping coffee. In b.g., a
text: trio of garish transvestite Hookers buys cigarettes, candy.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: ... Diana mentioned to me that you know
dialog: something about your parents.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Does anybody really know anything about
dialog: their parents? Actually, I’1l bet your
dialog: parents are terribly proud of their son
dialog: the doctor.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Actually my father’s dead, and --
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’m sorry. How?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Car accident. And my mother’s had a
dialog: stroke, so there’s no way of knowing if
dialog: she’s proud, actually.
dialog: 14.
text: He offers a slightly pained smile.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Were you driving the car?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: As a matter of fact.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: So you decided to become a doctor ..?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Obviously.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Can psychiatrists really cure people?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Freud called it "the impossible
dialog: profession".
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: I guess Jimmy agrees with Freud.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: Jimmy is ... your husband?
text: Heather offers a pained smile of her own.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: He thinks people in analysis just need
dialog: a good spanking.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Some of them could benefit from that.
text: Heather stubs out her cigarette.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I could use some air.
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET ~ NIGHT
text: The street is quite empty -- a sense that the rest of the
text: city is barricaded behind heavy doors and barred windows.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: So ... you hate your husband?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: "Hate"? That’s a strong word.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Why do you stay with him?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Maybe it’s a matter of chemistry ...
dialog: "pheromones". Isn/t that the word?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Pheromones have only been demonstrated
dialog: to work in animal mating. Humans are a
dialog: lot more complicated.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I‘m not so sure.
dialog: (then)
dialog: How are you planning to help Diana?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: To paraphrase Freud, I’m trying to turn
dialog: her neurotic misery into general
dialog: unhappiness.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Are you generally unhappy?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Actually you caught me at a bad time ~~
dialog: I’m feeling pretty good.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I don’t think I believe you.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (laughing, protests)
dialog: But my days are full, rich... I’mona
dialog: first-name basis with several mass
dialog: murderers.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (laughs, then)
dialog: May I call you Isaac?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: We really need your help.
text: As she flags a cab. It screeches to a stop. Heather climbs
text: in. Isaac leans into the window.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: wel?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (amends)
dialog: Diana.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Goodnight, Isaac. I’m glad we met.
text: As her cab takes off, Isaac pulls out a cigarette and sticks
text: it in his mouth.
text: And forgets to light it, as he stands here and stares at the
text: disappearing cab.
dialog: cut To:
scene_heading: INT. HEATHER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER
text: Memphis intermixed with Victorian antiques. A Francis Bacon
text: on one wail.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: ~- Jimmy --?
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: which is the size of a normal bedroom -- mirrored walls, two
text: sinks and w.c.’s, shower, tub, and five-foot diameter sunken
text: Jacuzzi in the middle, always filled with hot bubbling water.
text: An alcove houses an exercise area with Lifecycle, dumbbells,
dialog: treadmill, etc.
text: Luxuriating in the Jacuzzi is JIMMY EVANS, swarthy, with
text: thick, taunting features. For a man of 40, he’s in fine
dialog: shape -- and with all this equipment, why not?
text: He lazily eyes Heather. In a sleepy, deep, insinuating tone:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Heather. Honey. Man, I’ve missed you.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I tried you, Jimmy. I let the phone
dialog: ring forever.
text: There is none of the teasing insouciance heard with Isaac.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I been soaking awhile ... all evening,
dialog: actually, and I’m still unwinding.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Can I bring you a scotch? Something?
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I gotta haul my ass out of this tub.
dialog: We’re meeting Nick Pappas at Nell’s.
text: Heather nods. Jimmy nods at Heather, nodding. Then --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You knew that, right? That we had a
dialog: social obligation?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Well I mean ... I’ve been running all
dialog: day and --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Where, from Eve Arden to Bendel’s to
dialog: where?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Elizabeth Arden. And I’m tired.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You're tired.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You heard me.
text: She places her hands on her hips, challenging him. He grins.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I heard you. Now do it.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Not now. Please, Jimmy --
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Do it, Heather.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I told you, I’m tired.
text: She's whining a bit, like a child.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Do it.
text: Heather hopelessly stares at him. Then strips off her suit-
text: coat. Tosses it. Undoes her blouse ...
speaker_heading: CLOSE JIMMY
text: His eyes feast on her. A buzzard’s eyes.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Slower.
dialog: 18.
text: His voice is slightly choked, with lust.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Don’t ever tell anybody what we do.
text: And then he suddenly stands, in the Jacuzzi, the water
text: whooshing off him ~- this great dark hairy figure, emerging
text: like a sea monster from the depths. He steps out of the tub.
scene_heading: HIGH ANGLE - HEATHER
text: lies naked on the white marble floor. Fetally curled.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - JIMMY
text: Looming. Omnipotent. He stares down at his wife. When he
text: speaks, he sounds truly moved.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You are magnificent.
dialog: curt To:
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC'S OFFICE ~- AFTERNOON
text: Diana has just arrived. Wearing a cute pinafore, white
text: anklets, maryjanes. As she sits on the couch:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Isn't she beautiful, Dr. Barr?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Heather. She told me, You met her.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Compared to her I always felt like a
dialog: caterpillar, y’know? Creepy and
dialog: crawly.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Perhaps it’s unproductive to compare
dialog: yourself with Heather.

dialog: (trace of bile)
dialog: -- because I can’t measure up?
text: Diana catches herself; her voice softens.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You guys talked about Mom and Dad ..?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Actually we didn’t. And I want you to
dialog: know that we didn’t discuss what
dialog: happens in this room. If we meet
dialog: again, I’ll- only be a listener. And
dialog: I’1l let you know what she tells me.
text: Diana lies back.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I had the dream again.
dialog: (beat)
text: I’m arranging a centerpiece of flowers,
text: on a table.
text: She speaks rotely, as though reciting someone else’s words.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I decorate the flowerpot with fancy
dialog: paper.
text: Silence. When he’s sure she’s not going to say more:
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: What kind of flowers?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Three kinds. Lilies, carnations ...
text: She trails off again.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: ... And the third kind?
text: Diana shrugs -- she can’t remember.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What are your associations with the
dialog: word "lily"?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Like lily-white, I guess ... Pure.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What about "carnation"?
text: Diana draws a blank.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Do you know the word "carnal"?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: It has to do with ~- lust ... right?
text: Isaac nods.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: So far, in your centerpiece, you’ve
dialog: placed a symbol of purity ~- of
text: virginity ~~ and a symbol of lust.
text: Diana turns to Isaac with a coy, embarrassed smile.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I guess there’s a conflict here ..?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Do you remember what we said about the
dialog: stove ritual?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You mean somehow that it’s this passive
dialog: aggressive thing?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I think that "fear of intimacy" may be
dialog: an issue here.
dialog: As though to gain the upper hand:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: The stove ritual is over, Dr. Barr. I
dialog: haven’t done it in a week.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Why do you think that is?
text: As she considers, her body twitches on the couch, hiking up
text: her pinafore, revealing a great deal of leg.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I don’t know ...
dialog: (then)
dialog: I’m checking the gun now.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (tensing)
dialog: ~~ the gun?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I make sure the safety’s on, and that
dialog: it’s loaded ... five to ten times, in
dialog: the morning.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Why do you feel you need a gun?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I don’t feel I do. Heather made me
dialog: take it. It belongs to, um ~~
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: -~ Jimmy?
text: The name has popped out of his mouth ~~ both Isaac and Diana
text: look surprised. Quickly recovering:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Why don’t we focus on the feelings and
dialog: associations you get when you’re
dialog: "checking" the gun in the morning ..?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Well, it’s my surrogate penis, and the
dialog: safety being on is because I’m
dialog: ambivalent about my phallic fantasies
dialog: .». and the bullets are semen.
text: Isaac takes a beat.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Have you thought about the dangers of
dialog: keeping a loaded gun in your apartment?
text: Diana thinks about it. So does Isaac. He doesn’t look happy
dialog: at all.
speaker_heading: TIME CUT:
text: We're still in Isaac's office, but it’s evening. Heather is
text: sitting on the couch now. As she swings up her legs?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: So... is this where Diana lies?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: And sometimes tells the truth.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: When she’s deep in thought, does she
dialog: ... sort of twitch, and turn ...
text: Which Heather does, for Isaac’s amusement.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: ... making her skirt sort of accidently
dialog: ride up ... like this?
text: Heather somehow makes her skirt hitch up, to mid-thigh.
dialog: 22.
text: Isaac watches, as impassively as he can manage. When Heather
text: finally turns to him for a reaction:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Tell me about the gun.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What gun?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Jimmy’s gun. The gun you gave Diana.
text: Heather swings her legs over, sits up again.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Isaac. I worry about my baby sister
dialog: but I have not armed her. In case
dialog: you've missed it, Diana invents
text: neurotic compulsions. She thinks they
dialog: make her interesting. JI assume she
dialog: told you she checks her stove fifty
dialog: times every morning?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (nods)
dialog: But a fabrication is a kind of fantasy,
dialog: and a fantasy is a kind of wish. Do
dialog: you see what I’m getting at?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: Behind every lie, there’s an element of
dialog: truth ..?
text: Isaac nods again.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: still, I’m glad the gun is a lie.
text: Heather looks disappointed.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: -~ And that’s it?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Unless you want to tell me whatever you
dialog: came to tell me the other night.
text: Heather rises. Paces, like a cat.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Your downstairs office, this brownstone
dialog: ... It’s all very Dressed To Kill ...
text: Isaac smiles but he doesn’t respond.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Are you dangerous, Dr. Barr?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What do you think?
text: Suddenly she stops pacing and turns to him.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I think a psychiatrist can’t have a
dialog: personal relationship with a patient.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You're right.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What about a patient’s sister?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Technically, there’s nothing that
dialog: prohibits it. But -~ to me -~ it
dialog: doesn’t feel right.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: In addition to which you’re married.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Technically.
text: Heather sinks back down onto the couch. Sighs.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You try divorcing a Greek Orthodox
dialog: gangster.
text: Isaac smiles at her melodramatic choice of words.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: A "gangster"? What, he drives a Stutz
text: Bearcat and wears double-breasted
dialog: pinstriped suits?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: He drives a Mercedes 300 and wears
text: single-breasted pinstriped suits.
dialog: Jimmy builds public housing for the
dialog: poor, which is what gangsters do today.
dialog: We live together in the same apartment.
dialog: Emphasis on "apart".
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Look, our previous evening together
dialog: already generated some inappropriate
dialog: stuff in my session with Diana.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: That sounds like psychobabble -~ but if
dialog: it’s how you feel, let’s not beat this
dialog: to death.
text: She sits up. A last look at Isaac. Then she stands.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Goodnight. Goodbye.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Okay. I’m sorry. Goodbye.
text: He moves to the door, to let her: out -- they brush up against
text: each other, in the door frame.
text: Then they’re kissing. Running their hands over one another’s
text: bodies. Hungrily ... they’ve both been starving. In between
text: moans of pleasure and anticipation:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: There's a nurse upstairs. And my
dialog: mother ...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: We'll be quiet. I won’t tell.
text: They’ve fallen back onto the stairs that lead up to Isaac’s
text: apartment. Feverishly undressing each other here.
text: And then, abruptly, Heather disentangles herself from Isaac.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: -- What --?
text: She holds up a palm: wait.
text: Then begins a slow, languid, melancholy strip that instantly
text: hypnotizes him.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Do you like this?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (hoarse)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:

scene_heading: INT. PRISON WARD ~- MORNING
dialog: Isaac and Alan Lowenthal -- the reserved psychiatrist we saw
text: earlier, at the stadium -- have just entered the checkpoint.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: On the gate!
text: It’s a sort of cage, surrounded by mirrors and closed-circuit
text: cameras. Isaac nods at all the bars and security devices and
text: chirps at his gloomy colleague:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Leok at this! Shrinks in cages! But
dialog: we can free ourselves, Alan ... Learn
text: to hang-glide, maybe. Mentally, too.
text: Alan doesn’t know what to make of Isaac’s lightheadedness.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: cut it out. You’re making me nervous.
text: The Gatekeeper BUZZES them in.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAYROOM ~ MORNING ~ LATER
text: Where some PATIENTS play cards, others aimlessly roam around
text: the crowded room. Those most heavily medicated are slumped
text: before the TV watching Wheel of Fortune. Isaac, making his
text: rounds, is peppered with OS questions, e.g.: "When’s my court
dialog: date, Doc?" and "Hey, Doc, when do I get sprung outta here?"
text: Isaac is approached by INMATE 1.
speaker_heading: INMATE 1
dialog: Doc -- I’m charged with assault!
dialog: Compared to the motherfucking fights I
dialog: seen in here, what I had was a tiff.
dialog: And I'm charged with assault.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Billy: Regardless of what other people
dialog: call it or what other people do, you
dialog: still have to work on controlling your
dialog: anger. Okay?
text: Inmate 1 looks a tad defensive.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Anyway "lst Degree Tiff" doesn’t have
dialog: the right ring to it, does it?
dialog: 26.
text: Inmate 1 backs off. Isaac approaches an almost sweet-looking
text: INMATE 2, hunched in the corner.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What's up, Kevin?
speaker_heading: INMATE 2
dialog: Doc, I figured out why I smoked all
dialog: that angel dust and crack. It’s not
dialog: ‘cause I feel bad about myself. It’s
dialog: ‘cause I feel bad about the world.
dialog: Isaac is surprised and touched hy this.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Yeah? I think I know that feeling.
text: Inmate 2 is surprised but comforted by Isaac’s response.
speaker_heading: INMATE 2
dialog: You do ..?
text: Now, insistently tapping Isaac’s shoulder, is Bantar Man.
speaker_heading: BANTAR MAN
dialog: Doc ... I made you something in art
dialog: therapy class.
text: He furtively pulls several sheets of sketchbook paper out
text: from under his shirt and hands them to Isaac.
speaker_heading: CLOSE = ARTWORK
dialog: Crude paintings of the devil ... the names "Isaac" and
dialog: "Satan" connected with arrows ... repetitions of the phrase
dialog: "pr. Barr must die."
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Isaac puts on a broad smile.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: May I keep these?
speaker_heading: BANTAR MAN
dialog: They’re yours, Doc, Suitable for
text: framing.
text: Now Isaac notices Pepe Carrero, across the dayroom, longingly
text: staring out through the mesh window. Isaac crosses.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Hey, Pepe ...
text: Pepe turns. Sees Isaac, smiles.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: PEPE
dialog: Hey, Doc.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Pepe. You been hearing any voices?
speaker_heading: PEPE
dialog: Nada.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You know you’re being transferred as an
dialog: outpatient to Bronx Psychiatric, it’s a
dialog: civil hospital ...
speaker_heading: PEPE
dialog: Thanks to you, Dr. Barr. You ever need
dialog: anything from me, you just ask.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Look, I just want to know: After your
dialog: boyfriend brutalized you ... the thing
dialog: that happened, with the scissors ...
text: Pepe steps back, immediately uncomfortable. Isaac holds his
text: gaze, peers hard into his eyes.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Is there some part of you -~- way deep
dialog: inside you -- that feels maybe it was
dialog: right, though you know it was wrong?
text: Pepe pales.
speaker_heading: PEPE
dialog: Oh man ... No ..! I was crazy! And
dialog: for weeks after, all’s I could hear was
dialog: Ramon screaming. No way, man. Shit --
text: Isaac lightly puts a hand on Pepe’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I’m sorry, Pepe. I had to ask.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Let’s keep an eye on Larry Pomeranze ~~
dialog: he’s sure we’ve got a machine upstairs
text: that’s scrambling his brain.
dialog: (looks up at her)
dialog: Do we?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: I‘ve never known Larry to be wrong on
dialog: something like this.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Disassemble it immediately ... And also
dialog: -- and I hate to do this -- raise his
dialog: Thorazine to 1200 a day. Oh, and I
dialog: think we can D/C Lamarr King from one-~-
dialog: to-one suicide watch.
dialog: (starts off, stops)
dialog: Am I forgetting anything?
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: (sour)

speaker_heading: FRANKLIN
dialog: Forget it.

scene_heading: INT. ADMINISTRATIVE WING ~ AFTERNOON
text: Isaac and Alan munch hero sandwiches as they move along the
text: corridor, crowded with crying kids, shouting patients, cops
dialog: drifting here and there ...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: This new referral is so dull ...
dialog: Yesterday, during the session, I
text: actually started to fall asleep.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Long as you don’t snore.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: But what do you say at the end of a
dialog: droning monologue you haven’t heard?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You repeat the last word or two,
text: phrased as a question.
dialog: (demonstrates)
dialog: "your mother?"
text: Alan laughs.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I’ve got a great new patient who uses
dialog: the most elegant symbolism and verbal
text: bridges in her dream content ... She
text: represents her libido not by a tunnel
text: or a forest, but by a carnation.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Ah. Carnation. "Carnal". TI like it.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
text: She has an older sister. About thirty.
dialog: We met a couple of times to talk about
dialog: the family ...
text: Alan follows him into:
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC'S OFFICE ~ AFTERNOON
text: Cramped, crowded with files, made (barely) habitable only by
text: the window that faces onto a rooftop exercise area.
text: Alan shuts the door tight. Sits opposite Isaac.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: You didn’t sleep with her ..?
speaker_heading: ISAAC .
dialog: Look, if you never want to have lunch
dialog: with me again, I understand.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: No, don’t stop. I’d love to see you
dialog: hanged by your civil libertarian pals.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Hey, I went through the A.M.A.’s
dialog: Principles of Ethics, and even the
dialog: special annotations for psychiatry
dialog: don’t say anything about sleeping with
text: a patient’s sister.
text: Alan shakes his head, incredulous.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What can I say, Alan? I have a
dialog: weakness for unhappy women.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Don’t flatter yourself. All shrinks
dialog: have a weakness for unhappy women.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Yes, but this is something special ...
dialog: She’s really unhappy.
text: Alan is unamused.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: If your patient finds out -~- which
dialog: seems likely -- then all the trust
dialog: you’ve built goes down the dumper. If
dialog: she doesn’t find out, it’s because
dialog: you're lying to her, which means the
dialog: analysis can’t continue. Anyway you
dialog: know as well as I do that romantic love
dialog: is a projection. You don’t see this
dialog: woman ~~ you see your vision of her.
dialog: You’re in a delusional state, Isaac ...
dialog: No human being is so beautiful, so
dialog: special that she, uh ... that she --
text: Alan is looking past Isaac. His mouth is slightly
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: has stepped into the office. She’s like a goddess
dialog: the lower depths.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: C-can I help you?
dialog: 30.
dialog: agape.
dialog: visiting
text: Heather touches Isaac’s shoulder. Alan dies a little.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: The receptionist said you’d be here.
text: Isaac is surprised and delighted. He stands.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: This is Alan Lowenthal. My colleague,
dialog: my conscience. Alan, Heather Evans.
text: A blushing Alan jumps to his feet as well.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Pleased to meet you.
dialog: (offers his seat)
dialog: Please ... Sit down.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Sorry for barging in on you guys.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Don’t be.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (to Alan)
dialog: What were we just saying?
text: Alan flashes Isaac a mortified grin.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: That I’m late for rounds. Nice to meet
dialog: you, Ms. Evans.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Nice meeting you.
text: Alan mops his brow and hurriedly EXITS.
text: Heather smiles at Isaac.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: So ... Cure any crazies today?
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: No, but I was given a lovely set of
dialog: original watercolars. Created by a
dialog: personal friend of the President of
dialog: Bantar.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: "Bantar"?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
text: The planet. The theme of the work is
dialog: that Satan and I have much in common,
dialog: and that I must die.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: «+. God ...
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: So what’re you doing here?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Is it okay? I woke up and all I wanted
dialog: was to see you. And I can’t tonight
dialog: ... Jimmy made a reservation at Lutece.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: There’re worse places to eat dinner ...
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: That's just the beginning. Then it’s
dialog: on to Nell’s. Three times a week ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He makes me dance.
text: She looks down, as though in shame. Isaac reaches a hand to
text: her chin, turns her face up to his.
text: His mouth finds hers. She bites his lip. He pushes her
text: against the wall, hand groping under her skirt ... She grabs
text: and tears at him. They are almost making love when ...
speaker_heading: P.A (V.0.)
dialog: Dr. Barr ... Dr. Barr to the Prison
dialog: Ward immediately ... Dr. Barr ...
text: Neither seems to hear: they continue to consume one another.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON WARD ~- FIVE MINUTES LATER
text: Bantar Man is being restrained by Four C.0.‘s as a fifth fits
text: him for a straitjacket. Another C.O. kneels nearby, with a
text: smashed, bloody nose.
text: Alan has just injected Bantar Man with a heavy sedative as
text: Isaac belatedly arrives, still straightening his clothing.
text: He guiltily takes in the scene.
speaker_heading: ISAAC

speaker_heading: O'BRIEN

speaker_heading: ISAAC

dialog: (then, concedes)
dialog: Somebody’s husband.
text: O’Brien squints at his friend.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: She's trying to get out of it. And I’m
dialog: trying to find out if that’s as tough

speaker_heading: O’BRIEN
dialog: Ike, this isn’t you. You’re a rational

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Yeah. I know. But trust me, Mike ...
dialog: this is a Good Thing. Life affirming.

speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LUTECE - NIGHT
text: Jimmy and Heather, looking splendid but stiff, share a table
text: in one of the formal uhpolstered dining rooms upstairs. He’s
text: washing down sauteed sweetbreads with a wine that he
text: refreshes from a carafe. She’s picking at pelerines a la
text: Meridionale, and sipping ice water.
text: A CLATTERING of silverware in lieu of conversation. Finally:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Know what I love about Lutece?
text: Heather reluctantly raises her eyebrows: what?
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You take away the prices and all the
dialog: polite bullshit and it’s peasant food.
dialog: Mountain food. My kind of food.
text: Heather manages a halfhearted murmur.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Plus which we're not gonna run into any
dialog: of my, ah ... grease-a-ball business-a
dialog: buddies, y’know what I’m saying?
text: Another murmur from across the table.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: They’re in pig heaven in their pasta
text: palaces with the velvet walls and the
text: wine steward fresh off the boat. What
dialog: do those gorillas know from Alsation
dialog: cuisine ..?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where is Alsatia, anyway?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (quietly corrects)
dialog: Alsace.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Al’s ass? Who’s Al? Some stud you’re
dialog: seeing on the side?
text: Mortified, Heather glances at the neighboring Diners.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What do you care if they heard? Do you
dialog: think their shit don’t stink?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You can be very crude.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And you need that. "Crude." "Rough".
dialog: You pretend that you don’t but you do.
text: Heather looks down. She is mun.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: To get off.
dialog: (cold, quiet)
dialog: Don’t you?
text: Heather looks up.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’d like some wine with dinner.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You'd like some wine with dinner.
text: He lifts his glass, as though to hand it to her. But he
text: holds it tantalizingly out of reach.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Or don’t you remember the last time?
dialog: You got way out of hand.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: “Way out of hand".
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Wild.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I got wild! I have one good time --
dialog: once ~~ and I’m wild.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It’s more than once.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh you‘re right. Twice. Thrice.
dialog: {snaps her fingers)
dialog: -~ Hopa!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Two months I’m holding this reservation
dialog: and you pick tonight to grow a wild
dialog: hair up your ass.
text: Again Heather flicks her eyes to the nearby tables.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: They’re not gonna help you. You need
dialog: help, you pray. You pray to me.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: One sip.
text: There is a note of pleading in her voice.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You pray. "Our father ..."
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: "Our father ..."
text: Jimmy smiles. Then hands her his wine glass.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: One sip.
dialog: 36.
text: Heather takes a gulp. Then passes the glass back to hin.
text: Jimmy is happy now. As he polishes off his sweetbreads:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You believe I’m eating this? Me, who
dialog: used to be a vegetarian. And here I am
text: chewing on a pancreas. A pancreas is a
dialog: giand, f’r godsakes ...
text: During this speech, Heather has gone from listlessly forking
text: her scallops to furiously attacking them.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: Heather -~-?
text: Seemingly oblivious, Heather stabs at her scallops with such
text: force, the sauce splatters off the plate.
text: Several Diners in the immediate vicinity trade concerned
text: looks with Jimmy, who’s now leaning across the table.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Heather --!
text: Apparently brought back to her senses, Heather abruptly sets
text: down her silverware. Then, softly:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: It’s alright. I’m... a little woozy.
dialog: I need the ladies room.
text: She shakily stands, awkwardly pushes her chair aside.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’ll be fine.
text: She puts on a wan smile meant to reassure. Shuffles away
text: from the table. Jimmy tears off a chunk of roll. As he
text: starts to butter it we hear a startling SHRIEK OFF-SCREEN.
speaker_heading: HEATHER’S VOICE
dialog: He’s controlling me! My brain!
text: Horrified, Jimmy drops his butter knife. Turns. Gawks:
speaker_heading: WHAT HE SEES
text: At the staircase just beyond the dining room stands Heather.
text: Wild-eyed, mouth twisted, finger pointed at Jimmy. Her
text: screeches sound not at all like her natural voice: it’s as
dialog: though Heather were demonically possessed.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: My brain! My body. They’re not mine!
text: The hush is palpable. All eating and bustling have ceased;
text: Diners and Waiters alike are frozen by the spectacle,
text: Then Heather bolts back to the table. She hurls herself at a
text: horrified Jimmy, who ducks out of harm’s way ... Heather
text: crashes onto the table, which collapses onto the floor.
text: She is rushed by three waiters and two captains. As they
text: seize Heather, sprawled across the capsized table, her cries
dialog: continue, muffled:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: He controls my brain! My body --

speaker_heading: JIMMY’S VOICE
dialog: She had a drink a few times before and
dialog: kinda ... snapped. But I never thought
dialog: one big sip could set her off ...
scene_heading: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM ~- NIGHT - LATER
text: Heather, sweaty and bruised, is laid out on an examining

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: She’s been in before?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Why? We only get one visit?
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - JIMMY

speaker_heading: PHYSICIAN
dialog: Mr. Evans ... I’m Dr. Spector.
text: They start down the corridor crowded with Patients, standing,
text: sitting, sprawled on gurneys, etc.
speaker_heading: DR. SPECTOR
dialog: You realize your wife suffers from
dialog: Pathological Intoxication?
dialog: (more)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: DR. SPECTOR (Cont/d)
dialog: I see on her chart she came in here
dialog: last year after a similar incident.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: If I knew so little could make her go
dialog: flippy ... In Lutece, talk about
dialog: humiliating -~
speaker_heading: DR. SPECTOR
dialog: People with this syndrome will have a
text: dramatic, often violent, response to
dialog: even the most minute amounts of
dialog: alcohol. And never remember a thing.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - LATE NIGHT
text: Two orderlies deposit the semiconscious Heather into the back

speaker_heading: DR. SPECTOR
dialog: (tells Jimny)
dialog: We gave her five milligrams of Haldol.
dialog: Get her home, let her sleep off the

dialog: In any form. Understood?
scene_heading: INT. CAB (MOVING) ~ NIGHT
text: Heather is half-sprawled, head lolling. Jimmy studies her

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (soft, mournful)
dialog: You're damaged goods.
text: He reaches out and gently arranges her hair just so, as one
dialog: would do for a small child.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: But you’re also my wife.
text: He suddenly seizes Heather and desperately clutches her limp
text: form to him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: But if you ever embarrass me like that
dialog: again I’1ll fucking kill you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC’S LIVING ROOM - NEXT EVENING
text: He’s at his word processor, revising his paper. In b.g. we

dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - SCREEN
dialog: As Isaac types: "Yet since the Reagan Era, the insanity
dialog: defense has been under fire from"
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Disgusted, he stops typing. Mutters, as he deletes:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Bullshit.
text: Reaches into the ashtray, finds the longest cigarette butt.
text: As he starts to light it, there is a loud BUZZ.
text: Isaac jumps up, crosses to the intercom.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE
dialog: (through filter)
dialog: National Institute of Mental Health.
scene_heading: INT. VESTIBULE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: HEATHER

scene_heading: INT. ISAAC’S KITCHEN - FIVE MINUTES LATER
text: As he mixes two vodka tonics he hears, from the living room:
speaker_heading: HEATHER‘S VOICE
dialog: Is your mother awake?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
text: Watching the tube.
text: He crosses, with the drinks, into:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Heather is peering at Isaac’s computer screen.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Don’t read that. Would you like to
dialog: meet her?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: 40.
text: She looks up as Isaac hands her a glass. Lightly sniffs.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Vodka?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: And tonic.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’d prefer hot water with lemon. I’m
dialog: fighting a cold. And f don’t drink.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But you smoke ...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Want one? Go in my pocketbook.
text: She tilts her head in the direction of the couch, where she’d
text: left it. Then crosses to the kitchen, to turn on the kettle.
text: Isaac reaches into Heather’s pocketbook. And finds an item
text: that’s more intriguing than cigarettes. He pulls out:
speaker_heading: A LEAD PIPE
text: Chrome-plated, about five inches long, with threaded ends.
speaker_heading: SCENE
text: Isaac is studying it as Heather steps back into the room.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh. That’s protection. There’s a lot
dialog: of lunatics in this town.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Fortunately for some of us.
text: He hefts the pipe.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Hmm. Why not a whistle? Or mace? Or
dialog: a nice, traditional kick in the balls?
text: Meantime Heather is reading off Isaac's computer screen:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: "The insanity defense is as old as the
dialog: conflict between free will and
dialog: determinism. As far back as the Bible,
dialog: distinctions are drawn between those
dialog: who are criminally responsible and
dialog: those who are not ..."
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Painful, isn’t it? I’ve got to rework
dialog: the whole thing.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Why? It looks interesting.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
text: The words of a sage who acquired his
text: hard-won wisdom in the law library.
text: Heather turns from the screen to him.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Whereas now that you're sleeping with a
dialog: patient's married sister, you’ve become
dialog: worldly and profound?
text: Isaac is about to retort, when he notices:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Your cheek. What happened --?
text: Heather averts her face to make the bruise less obvious.
speaker_heading: BREATHER
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Jimmy?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I thought you wanted a cigarette. Go
dialog: on -~ have a cigarette.
text: Still clutching the lead pipe, Isaac holds it in her face.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: This is protection from Jimmy ~~ isn’t
dialog: it? Talk to me.
text: Heather steps toward him. Reaches out for him.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I can stay late. He has a poker game,
dialog: Tuesdays and Thursdays. Sometimes he
dialog: plays all night.
text: Incongruous mindless LAUGHTER cascades from the back bedroon.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: He leaves you all night to play poker.
dialog: 42.
text: As he puts the pipe back in her pocketbook:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Every new detail helps me to hate him
dialog: more. And I don’t even know the guy.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Let’s leave it that way.
text: In the kitchen the kettle emits a SHRIEK that quickly becomes
text: piercing. But neither Isaac nor Heather appears to notice.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I don’t want to leave it. And I don’t
dialog: think you do either.
text: Heather’s response is to abruptly -- almost violently -~ kiss
text: Isaac’s lips. As abruptly, she breaks the kiss.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Isaac, don’t rewrite your paper. Don/‘t
dialog: change because of me. This isn’t real.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: No? What’s real? A husband who drops
text: a bundle at five-card stud, then
text: stumbles home and smacks his wife?
text: Isaac shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: That's bullshit. This is real.
text: Heather shakes her head -- more adamant, even, than Isaac.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: No. This isn‘t real. It’s a movie.
dialog: We're in a movie.
text: Her tone is almost desperate. Isaac starts to speak, but:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Here’s a scene. I’m in bed --
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC’S BEDROOM ~- NIGHT
text: A modest room upstairs. Crowded also with books and papers.
text: Heather lies on Isaac’s bed, nearly naked, partially covered
text: by a sheet. He stands in the far corner, shrouded in shadow.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: In my bed. Asleep. But warm... it’s
text: summer. I toss and turn.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (soft, rapt)
dialog: And who am I?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You’re an intruder. You’ve come for my
dialog: jewels. You thought I was out of town,
dialog: with my husband. But I stayed behind.
text: Isaac moves toward the bed. We see, now, that he is naked.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You've just come out of jail. Haven’t
dialog: been with a woman in five years. But
dialog: you were a legendary lover ... You’d --
text: Isaac silences her with a soft kiss. Then deftly removes her
text: lingerie with one hand while tenderly stroking her with the
text: other. His movements are gentle, deliberate. Healing.
text: Then Heather pulls her mouth apart from his, to speak. Her
text: voice is oddly childlike.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Can you ... fuck me without hurting me?
text: Isaac is stunned by the question. But now is not the time to
dialog: play shrink.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: of course.
text: He continues to make love to her. She begins to respond. At
text: first she is tentative, but it builds, steadily, and builds
text: more ... When she comes, it is both ecstatic and a strange
text: surprise. A tear slides down her cheek.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: -.. What?
text: Heather pulls herself together. Kisses Isaac’s forehead.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: That never happened to me before.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You mean, you don’t come when -~
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Don’t be silly.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Then ... why ..?
text: A beat, then Heather swings her legs off the bed.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: T have to go.
text: Her tone is suddenly, oddly cordial. She finds her bra, her
text: panties. Stands before the mirror and brushes her hair with
text: quick strokes.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Stay awhile longer. I want to talk.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Iocan’t ... You know I can’t.
text: She continues to brush her hair -- in an abstract way, like
text: an autistic activity. Now, without turning from the mirror:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: How is Diana? Will she be okay?
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: We'll see progress ... But there’s no
dialog: magic. It takes a lot of time and hard
dialog: work to break through the defenses --
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: {matter of fact)
dialog: Our Mom died when we were small -~ Dad
dialog: raised us alone. He raped Diana. More
dialog: than once. She’s blocked it all out.
text: Heather finally turns from the mirror, to face Isaac.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Will that speed things up a little?
text: Isaac is startled, though not entirely surprised. He reaches
text: out to touch her.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: It‘ll help.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Good.
text: The sound of a SIREN, outside ... barreling into the night.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: I know it was hard for you to tell me
dialog: that.
text: Heather presses herself hard against him, but doesn’t speak.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Stay the night. The hell with Jimny.
dialog: 45.
text: Heather’s eyes shine.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: He’d kill us both.
text: She pushes away from him and quickly crosses to the door. As
dialog: Isaac follows her out, we HEAR:
speaker_heading: DIANA’S VOICE
dialog: Have you seen her again, Dr. Barr?
dialog: cur To:
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC’S OFFICE ~ DAY
text: Diana is lying on the couch.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Did you talk about me?
text: Isaac sits in the EFames chair. A beat, then:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: No. We didn’t.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Are you two lovers?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Why do you want to know?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Because I keep imagining it.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: How does that make you feel? When you
dialog: imagine it ..?
text: Diana considers. Then changes the subject.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I had the dream again.
text: In a somnolent monotone, as though instantly self-hypnotized:
speaker_heading: DIANA
text: I’m arranging a centerpiece of flowers,
dialog: on a table. I use fancy paper to
dialog: decorate the flowerpot ... the paper
dialog: feels like velvet ... and there are
text: three kinds of flowers.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What kinds?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Lillies, carnations ...
text: She trails off.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: What’s the third kind, Diana?
text: After a long beat:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Violets.
text: Isaac lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: “Violets”.
text: Diana turns her head, to see him.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Does that mean something?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What do you think?
text: Diana just stares.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Let’s say the table is you, Diana ...
dialog: Compared to your sister you see
dialog: yourself as plain, flat ...
text: uninteresting.
text: Diana doesn’t contradict this.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: The centerpiece of flowers ... perhaps
dialog: .-. is your sexuality. And the
dialog: connection between purity and lust ...
dialog: the missing piece of the puzzle ... is
dialog: "violets".
text: Diana makes a dismissive face.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Violence are just flowers.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: "Violence"?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I didn’t say that.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: I said "violates".
text: She catches herself.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Violets. Godammit -- violets.
text: Abruptly she sits up and swings her feet over the side of the
text: couch so she’s facing Isaac. She looks upset.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Perhaps it relates to something in your
dialog: past, that you’ve ... put away.
dialog: As though panicked by this suggestion:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: They’re just flowers, Dr. Barr. I used
dialog: to do floral arrangements ... Why does
dialog: everything always have to be about sex?
text: Isaac remains impassive.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: fell me more about this fancy paper,
dialog: that feels like velvet.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (heatedly)
dialog: You mean something gross, like it’s
dialog: pubic hair. I knew you’d say that.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: No, you said it.
text: Diana glances at her watch. Then swings her legs off the
dialog: couch.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Where’re you going?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Hour’s up.
text: As she starts to rise:
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: I did see your sister last night. We
dialog: did talk about you.
text: Diana sinks back onto the couch.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: .-. About your father.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: It’s true.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What's true?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I wanted him to be dead. And he did.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: He "did"?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Had a heart attack. Dropped dead. And
dialog: I was happy.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: And why were you happy?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Because he hated me. Once he was dead
dialog: we were finally free! We could start
dialog: fresh, come to New York ...
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Whose idea was that?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Oh, Heather has all the ideas. I just
dialog: ... I just agree with her.

speaker_heading: O’BRIEN

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You haven’t seen the girl, Michael.

text: Isaac, hugging his sides, tries to stay warm by shuffling

text: ACROSS THE STREET
text: Heather, escorted by Jimmy, as they exit their building and
text: are helped into an idling limousine.
dialog: 50.
dialog: BACK TO ISAAC

scene_heading: INT. NELL’S - NIGHT (LATER)
text: Heather and Jimmy on the dance floor. He’s casual, loose ...

text: Now as their bodies separate, we see between them to the har.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
text: Finishing what, to judge by body language, is not his first

speaker_heading: ISAAC
text: is too far gone to care: He continues to baldly stare.
speaker_heading: SCENE
text: Jimmy signals to Heather -~ he’s had enough. He leads her

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Were you just giving me a look?

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: c'mon, Jimmy ~~
text: Jimmy won’t let it go.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Was that a look you were giving me?
text: Heather’s eyes flick to Isaac, pleading with him to back off.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
text: It was a look of admiration.
text: Heather inhales -- oh God, what next?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (continuing, to Jimmy)
dialog: I’m a fan of yours. Of all the great
dialog: builders: Le Corbusier, Donald Trump,
dialog: Adolf Hitler ...
text: A tense beat as Jimmy measures his response. But Heather

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - 5 MINUTES LATER
text: Isaac douses his face and tries to sober up. Now he raises
dialog: his face, to dry it --

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You little pricks over at Justice
dialog: either hand down an indictment or stay
dialog: off my ass. Remember: Shit flies two

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Shit definitely flies two ways.
text: Jimmy takes a step closer.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: That'll solve your legal problems.

dialog: 52.
text: Isaac swings at Jimmy’s face but Evans is quick, and the blow
dialog: is glancing, at best.
text: Jimmy pushes Isaac against the sink. He’s about to punch him
text: out when two elegant men emerge from the same toilet stall.

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: It was dumb, I know. I’m sorry.
dialog: You've been crying.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’ve caught a goddamn cold.
text: She notices the bruise. Lightly strokes it.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: That looks terrible.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Now we both bear the Mark of Jimmy. By
dialog: the way, he thought I was with the
dialog: Justice Department. C‘mon, Heather ...
dialog: Do I dress that bad?
text: Heather isn’t amused.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: That’s why psychiatry is the
dialog: Wimpossible profession". Psychiatrists
dialog: are impossible ... More narcissistic
dialog: than any of your patients.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I just felt a neurotic, masochistic ...
dialog: stupid need to see him. See you

text: Heather involuntarily shudders.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: After the other night with you, I...
dialog: can’t bear him touching me.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Leave. Divorce him ~-
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: It’s not that easy! He’d still be ...
dialog: around. And I’d ... I’d still be who I
dialog: am. Divorce ... it’s just a legalism.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But a fairly definitive one.
text: Heather grabs Isaac’s shirt, pulls him to her.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Let’s not talk. Let’s just fuck --
text: Isaac holds her off.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Why do you think -- really think -- you
dialog: can’t walk out on Jimmy? Because he’s
dialog: Greek Orthodox? A gangster? No, it’s
dialog: because he’s what you understand in a
dialog: man, what you expect from a man ...
dialog: That, and "fucking". So far, I bet,
dialog: you've been "fucked" by every man
dialog: you’ve ever known, But it doesn’t have
dialog: to be that way. You have a choice.

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Den’t turn. Just come in.
speaker_heading: BEHIND ISAAC

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - EVENING
text: Heather quickly leads Isaac past the doorman. Softly:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Is it him?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I don’t know.
text: They move to the elevators, in a bank off to the side. She
text: presses Up. Both anxiously look up, at the floor indicator
text: above the car door.
speaker_heading: THE INDICATOR
text: As 2 blinks off, and Lobby blinks on. Behind them, the
text: CLACKING of a man’s SHOES, approaching.
scene_heading: IN THE ELEVATOR
text: As the door opens and Isaac and Heather quickly board. Isaac
dialog: presses Door Close.
text: A hand reaches in, jolting open the door. And --
text: ~- a harmless old GENT in coke-bottle glasses boards. He
text: brings his face close to Heather’s. Squints.
speaker_heading: GENT
dialog: Evening, Mrs. Evans.
text: Heather manages a smile as Isaac presses Door Close again.

speaker_heading: GENT

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: HEATHER

scene_heading: INT. VESTIBULE - EVENING

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Call me.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - EVENING - TWO MINUTES LATER
text: Isaac exits the building into a shadowy alley where trash is
text: collected. Then humiliatingly slips in some slick stuff .....
text: Isaac gets to his feet. Collects himself -- and his dignity
text: -- then darts out of the alley, and hurries down the block.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HEATHER’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: Heather stands here, sipping more Nyquil. Muffled, through
text: the walls, she hears a strange, unearthly TRAMPING sound.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM/SPA - EVENING
text: It is Jimmy on the treadmill, in running shoes and shorts --
text: hirsute, pouring sweat, feet POUNDING. An almost fascistic
text: picture of power in motion.
dialog: 58.
text: Heather stands in the doorframe, watching the spectacle. He
text: instantly senses her presence. Without looking at her:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: We're meeting Joe Giannatasio at Tre
dialog: Scalini, at eight.
text: A smile of contempt crosses her lips.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’m in for the night. I have a cold.
text: She sips her Nyquil.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Two weeks I’m holding reservations.
text: Heather’s response is to take another sip of Nyquil.
text: Jimmy shuts off the treadmill.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: C'mon. Go to your room. Make yourself
dialog: gorgeous.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’m staying in. I’m sick.
text: She swigs again on the Nyquil. Jimmy crosses, for a towel.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You're sick? Now tell me something I
dialog: don’t know.
text: On "don’t", he swats the Nyquil out of her hand. The bottle
text: goes flying, shatters against the mirrored wall, cracking it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Shit. You’re paying for that --
text: A cruel glint in his eye. He brings the towel to his face.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Take off your clothes. Get down on
dialog: your knees.
text: He vigorously dries the sweat from his forehead and --
text: ~- Heather reaches for the nearest dumbbell. Grips it with
text: both hands and swings it at his temple!
text: It connects with a hideous CRACK, the impact sending Jimmy
text: over the side of the Jacuzzi, into the bubbling water.
dialog: 59.
text: All we see are his feet, bobbing ... and the towel still
text: covering his face, like a shroud. A stain spreads on it,
text: then the towel floats away, revealing eyes open in surprise,
text: turning the water a sick fizzy pink ~- and Heather SCREAMS.
text: FADE OUT. As the SCREAMS subside, we FADE UP ON:
scene_heading: EXT. RIKERS ISLAND - NEXT MORNING

text: of the picnic table. The chair opposite is empty.
text: Through CLANGING steel DOORS at the far end of the Visitors
text: Area comes Heather, escorted by a female C.0. Heather’s skin
text: is chalky, hair greasy and limp, eyes swollen from erying.
text: Spotting Isaac, she breaks away from the C.0., swiftly moves
text: to the chair opposite, and sits.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Heather mimes that she needs a ciagrette. Isaac shakes one
text: out for himself too, lights them both. Then:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: He found out about us? Attacked you?
text: Heather shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Threatened you?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (fights for control)
dialog: It wasn’t like that. We were talking
dialog: 1... a fight, but nothing -~ unusual ...
dialog: and then, God I, just snapped, like --
text: She brings the cigarette to her mouth with a trembling hand.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Like those other times.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What other times?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: The feeling that came over me. Losing
dialog: control. Going crazy --
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: But this time, I didn’t have a drink.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I was going to tell you ... but it’s
dialog: not easy for me ... I guess I wanted
dialog: you to think IT was perfect ...

text: She laughs -~ softly, bitterly.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Something happens to me when I drink.
dialog: It’s horrible, I become ... I don’t

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Have you seen a doctor for this?
text: Heather half-nods.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: ... And did they diagnose it?

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Did they call it ~~ would you remember?
dialog: -~ "pathological intoxication"?
text: Heather frowns, tilts her head -- maybe ...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I don’t know --
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But you said you didn’t have a drink --
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Of course not. I know I can’t drink.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Okay ... What did you do?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I... went into the bathroom ... Had
dialog: some more Nyquil ... Jimmy was there --
text: Isaac blinks: of course.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: The Nyquil. You @grank ~~ how much?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: A few sips. Quite a few ...
text: Isaac leans across the table.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Don’t you know that Nyquil is twenty-
dialog: five percent alcohol?
text: Heather looks baffled.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You didn’t know what you were doing --
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Isaac, I’m not crazy --
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But you’ve been treated for this, am I
dialog: right? For pathological intoxication?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’ve been ... they brought me in to,
dialog: um, New York Hospital ... twice ... and
dialog: once to Lenox Hill ...
text: Isaac nods. The wheels are spinning.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Do you have a lawyer?
text: Heather shakes her head. Despairing:
speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: GRUSIN

speaker_heading: O/BRIEN

text: Alan, still shaken, shoots O’Brien a desperately blank look.
speaker_heading: O’BRIEN
dialog: ~- Didn‘’t one slash her wrists?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh. Yes.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Didn’t another break her son’s arm?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: O’BRIEN
dialog: Didn’t --
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: And one of ‘em threw himself in front

text: He turns to the jury. Brightly:

speaker_heading: FOREMAN

dialog: longer represents a danger to herself
dialog: or others, and that she no longer
dialog: suffers from active dangerous mental

text: Heather, ill at ease in the midst of the cacaphony, anxiously
text: watches for someone. Now she sees ~~
dialog: 76.
text: -- Diana and Isaac, as they are let into the room. Heather
text: quickly crosses, embracing first her sister, than Isaac. We
dialog: realize we’ve never seen all three in the same FRAME before.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: How're you making out in here?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I don‘t know ... How long do you think
dialog: I’ll have to stay ..?
text: As Isaac leads her (Diana following) to an unoccupied table:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Technically, it’s indefinite. But you
text: play the game and the shrinks’11 sign
dialog: you out in maybe six to eight weeks ...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: That’s two months. Isaac, don’t you
dialog: know anyone on the staff who --
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Well I mean you did kill your husband.
text: Heather and Isaac shoot Diana a quick look. Then the lovers
text: regard each other again.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Is it that terrible in here?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: No but it’s ... there’s noise, all the
text: time, day and night. People shouting,
text: and the damned TV. And lights on, all
dialog: night too. That’s hard on my nerves.
text: She reaches out for Isaac’s cigarette, has a hungry puff.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: And all I can think about is being with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: When you're released, I’d like you to
dialog: come live with me.
text: Heather doesn’t say no. So Isaac turns to Diana. Gently:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Obviously I can’t remain your doctor at
dialog: that point. I know a number of
dialog: excellent analysts who'd --
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: That’s okay.
text: Like a child, she has a hard time hiding her hurt. Hastily:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But there’s no hurry. For the next two
dialog: months, anyway ... I don’t see why we
dialog: can’t continue together ...
text: Now a strained looks crosses Heather’s face. Isaac and Diana
text: notice. Everyone starts to say something at once --
text: ~~ then everyone stops.
scene_heading: INT. KIRBY FORENSIC ~ MORNING (LATER)
text: Isaac and Diana exit the elevator. As they cross the lobby,
text: she takes his arn.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Didn’t she look awful? She almost

scene_heading: INT. NYU AUDITORIUM LECTURE HALL ~ AFTERNOON (A WEEK LATER)

speaker_heading: SPEAKER
text: Elsewhere, Freud refers to the female

speaker_heading: THE AUDIENCE
text: Including Isaac. Bored, he drums his fingers on his leg ...
speaker_heading: SPEAKER’S VOICE
dialog: In his Interpretation of Dreams, the
dialog: man who gave the world "penis envy"
dialog: declares that women’s libido is
dialog: essentially masochistic. The evidence?
dialog: 78.
text: BACK TO SPEAKER
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
text: It’s buried deep in Chapter VI... A

dialog: floral centerpiece, has the poor taste
dialog: to mix violets with lillies and
dialog: carnations.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
text: sits up straighter in his chair.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER‘’S VOICE
dialog: Of course violets represent women’s
dialog: unconcious need to be violated --
dialog: violently, wouldn’t you know?
text: BACK TO SPEAKER
text: Hitting her stride now.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: But I would like to paraphrase the good
dialog: doctor and proclaim that sometimes a
dialog: violet is just a violet!
dialog: BACK TO ISAAC
text: He quickly makes his way -~ quietly excusing himself -- along

speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. UNIVERSITY PLACE - AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - ISAAC
text: rushes to the Information Desk.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: -~ Where’s your psychology section?
scene_heading: INT. THE PSYCHOLOGY SECTION
text: A separate room, dimly lit, low-ceilinged, claustrophic. He
text: finds the Freud shelves.
dialog: 79.
text: An entire shelf is devoted to the Standard Edition of the
dialog: Complete Works of Sigmund Freud -~ 24 Volumes. Isaac reaches
dialog: for Volume V, The interpretation of Dreams.
scene_heading: CLOSE - INDEX OF DREAMS
text: Isaac’s finger trails down the pages past hundreds of dreams,
text: to the dream listed as "Table Decorated With Flowers".
speaker_heading: ISAAC
text: anxiously thumbs through the dream. INTERCUT between ISAAC
text: and phrases from Freud’s text as, whispering, Isaac reads:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: "T arrange the centre of a table with
dialog: flowers ... I decorate the flowers with
text: fancy paper. The paper looks like
dialog: velvet ... There are lillies of the
dialog: valley, pinks, or carnations ... and
dialog: violets."
text: Isaac stands there, frozen ... And then he slowly shuts the
text: book, replaces it on the shelf.
scene_heading: EXT. LIBRARY ~ AFTERNOON
text: As Isaac hurries out, arm upraised for a cab. But it is the
text: start of rush hour, and there are no cabs.
text: Isaac starts to run ... down the crowded sidewalk ... nearly
text: knocking over numerous outraged pedestrians --
scene_heading: EXT. 100 CENTRE STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Most everybody is streaming out of the Criminal Courthouse.
text: Isaac races up the steps. He fights the tide, to get into:
scene_heading: INT. ARRAIGNMENT COURT - EARLY EVENING
text: The familiar chaos -- lawyers, lowlifes ... Isaac quickly
text: moves toward the rear, craning his neck for:
speaker_heading: HECTOR
text: The pudgy Court Officer he spoke to during Heather’s trial.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Dr. Barr ...
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (winded)
dialog: Hector ... May I see you a moment?
text: Before Hector can reply, Isaac is guiding him into a corner.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: That day at the trial ... You said "I
dialog: never thought we’d see her up there."
text: Hector blinks as he remembers.
text: Isaac nods.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I thought you meant, as a witness. But
dialog: that isn’t what you meant, is it?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Not exactly ...
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You meant, as a defendant. Didn’t you?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: (hedges)
dialog: Not that it’s any of my business, but
dialog: ... Ms. Evans is your girlfriend?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: A guy like me, married as Iam...
text: notices a woman like that. Even with
text: glasses and a kerchief.
dialog: (explains)
text: She sat in the back row a coupla times
dialog: last year.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Last year ...
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: When you was testifying.
dialog: (grins agreeably)
dialog: She must really love you. Looked like
dialog: she was hanging on your every word.
dialog: Now he knows.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: I’m glad for you, Doc, that she got
text: off. The woman’s really something.
speaker_heading: ISAAC

dialog: Yes. She really is.

scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE ~ ISAAC

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Listen. I --
text: The Moderator smiles with relief.
speaker_heading: MODERATOR
dialog: Thank god. You’re next.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Sorry. I can’t do this. Something’s
dialog: come up and -~-
text: In b.g., a FIGURE at the mike is concluding his introduction.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: ... Barr, of Bellevue Hospital.
speaker_heading: MODERATOR
dialog: Don’t bust my chops, Isaac. You’re on.
scene_heading: ANGLE ~ ISAAC AT THE PODIUM
text: A moment later. In no mood, Isaac tentatively begins:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: The insanity defense, ah ... dates back
dialog: to the Babylonians and Assyrians ...
dialog: Both the Bible and the Talmud contained
dialog: several references to ...
text: He trails off. Blinks at his audience. Then puts aside his
text: text. Takes a breath,
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Isn’t every act of violence a form of
dialog: insanity? The "crime of passion" we
dialog: understand in that context, yes, but --
text: He seems, momentarily, to lose this thread as well.
scene_heading: IN THE AUDIENCE
text: Restless shifting. Alan and O’Brien trade curious glances.
dialog: BACK TO ISAAC
text: As he finds his voice again.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But what about someone who coldly plans
dialog: the death of another? Isn’t that -- in
dialog: a sense -- even more pathological? But
dialog: if that is sick ... as we psychiatrists
dialog: insist, then ... aren’t all criminals
dialog: sick, and shouldn’t all prisons become
dialog: hospitals? And not just prisons ... I
dialog: can imagine a time when this whole city
dialog: will, in fact, be one enormous minimum
dialog: security psychiatric facility ...
text: Isaac takes another breath. Then hurriedly stuffs his papers
text: back into his briefcase and strides off the dais.
scene_heading: IN THE AUDIENCE
text: People trade rueful looks: another promising young shrink
text: self-destructs.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NEW DELHI RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT
text: TRACK with Isaac as he crosses the crowded room, to join:
text: Alan and O’Brien, washing down curries with Taj Mahal beer.
speaker_heading: O’BRIEN
dialog: Look who’s here: The prophet Ezekiel.
text: Isaac sits. He looks pensive.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Congratulations. That was perhaps the
dialog: most bizarre valedictory since Nixon’s
text: farewell to his White House staff.
text: Isaac pours himself a beer, takes several big gulps. But he
text: hasn‘’t spoken yet, or cracked a smile.
text: O’Brien turns to Alan.
speaker_heading: O’BRIEN
dialog: You know what the problem is -- this
dialog: dude doesn’t trust happiness. Don’t
dialog: you witchdoctors have a name for it?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Anhedonia.
dialog: (studies Isaac)
dialog: Actually, I think what we're seeing is
dialog: a crisis of commitment. Typically, in
dialog: a love triangle, when the third party
text: is vanquished, the lovers develop a -~
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: O/BRIEN
dialog: I know: You/’re uptight about taking on
dialog: the formidable Widow Evans... piece of
dialog: work ... But think of the perks: Park
dialog: Avenue condos, Bavarian cars, vacations
dialog: in Virgin Gorda ... And I figured you’d
text: end up with an ex-hippie social worker.
text: Isaac ignores O’Brien, turns to Alan.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Have you ever had a patient with a
dialog: phony pathology?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: You mean, reporting bogus symptoms,
dialog: dreams, etc? We’ve all had patients
dialog: like that.
text: Q/Brien listens intently, as:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: And how do you proceed with patients
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: You dig beneath the phony pathology to
dialog: get to the real pathology. There’s
dialog: always something there to stir up.
text: He and O’Brien watch, curious, as Isaac ponders. And then
text: abruptly rises.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: T gotta go.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT
text: O’Brien catches up to Isaac, halfway down the block.
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
dialog: Something not kosher with the sister
dialog: act? Am I in the ballpark here?
text: Isaac doesn’t answer ~~ just keeps walking. Fast.
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
dialog: Notice I’m not asking what. ‘Cause
dialog: it’s over. We won.
text: By now, Alan has caught up too.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You won. I helped my girlfriend get
text: away with murder.
text: Alan pales.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh shit. Oh shit! I knew it! In my
dialog: gut -- oh God --!
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
dialog: Get a goddam grip on yourself.
text: Then back to Isaac, moving so fast now he’s nearly jogging.
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
dialog: I @gon’t want to know anything about it.
dialog: Just make it right somehow.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I’ll do what I have to do.
speaker_heading: O'BRIEN
dialog: No police, no publicity ...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (terrified, babbles)
dialog: You dragged us into this -- you gotta
dialog: fix it, Isaac --
text: O’Brien glares at Alan again. When he turns back, Isaac has
text: sped into a full-out sprint, leaving his friends behind ...
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAB - NIGHT (MOVING)
text: Isaac, in the back seat, restlessly bounces his knee up and
text: down, taps his teeth. As the cab brakes, he looks up.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Don’t be mean, turn to green.
scene_heading: ANGLE ~ TRAFFIC SIGNAL
text: Instantly, the light turns green. The cab lurches ahead.
speaker_heading: cUuT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. KIRBY FORENSIC FACILITY - NIGHT (LATER)
text: Isaac hops out of the cab. Dashes into the building.
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. NURSING STATION - ISAAC
text: Revved, almost manic, he impatiently listens as:
speaker_heading: NIGHT NURSE
dialog: I’m sorry, Dr. Barr, but it’s well past
dialog: visiting hours. The inmates are alr--
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I know. But listen: I have to finish
dialog: a report for court tomorrow and I just
dialog: realized I’m missing some data. And
dialog: I’m gonna get killed if I don’t have it
dialog: first thing in the morning --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHART ROOM - NIGHT (5 MINUTES LATER)
text: An Orderly escorts Heather into the room. She is surprised
text: to find Isaac here, pacing.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Hil What‘s going on?
text: Isaac waits for the orderly to exit. Heather takes a step
text: forward, steals a quick kiss. Then pulls away, when Isaac
text: doesn’t kiss back. Off her questioning look:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: When you married Jimmy were you already
dialog: planning to kill him? or did the plan
dialog: just sort of evolve?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Right, what? What about me? Are you
text: gonna eat a bowl of cherriés jubilee
dialog: and then push me in front of a bus?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Isaac, please -- this is crazy --
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Crazy maybe but clever too, sending me
dialog: your sister -- how concerned and
dialog: compassionate ... and I fell for it. Tf
dialog: believed every word. I thought --
dialog: finally -- something real. But all
dialog: along you were just sucking me in --
text: Heather’s tone is simultaneously pleading and piercing:
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Don’t turn on me. You’re the only man
dialog: I ever trusted.
text: She moves toward him again. Isaac pushes her off.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You forgot about one phenomenon:
dialog: transference. The bond a patient
text: develops with the doctor who listens to
text: her, analyzes her, counsels her ...
dialog: it’s such a powerful force, even a
dialog: phony patient will start to feel
dialog: something you might call "love".
dialog: (then)
dialog: Diana told me everything. How you came
dialog: to court, watched me testify ...
dialog: Auditioning me for the part ...
text: Heather sinks onto the nearest chair. Weakly:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Diana doesn’t love you.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But she thinks she does. You let her
dialog: lie on my Couch week after week free~-
text: associating, fantasizing, fabricating
dialog: ... Well, that gives a psychiatrist
dialog: some insight. And a degree of control.
text: When Heather looks up we see that she is crying.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Get out of here. I never want to see
dialog: you again.
text: Isaac lights a Camel. He’s riffing, on anxiety overdrive,
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: But you will -~ every six months. Oh
dialog: yes you will. I/’11 be on the
dialog: evaluating committee that visits you!
dialog: We'll consider how you’re interacting
dialog: with other patients, look at the
text: paintings and little clay sculptures
dialog: you’ve done in art therapy ... See,
dialog: it'll be quite awhile before you get
dialog: out -- once you’re stuck in a maximum
dialog: security psychiatric hospital, your
dialog: civil rights sort of ... evaporate.
dialog: Yes and -- do you know about the anti-
dialog: psychotic drugs? The side effects?
dialog: Speech impairment. Facial twitches ...
dialog: 87.
text: Heather dries her eyes. Stands. Steps toward Isaac and puts
text: a hand on his cheek. Even in extremis, she is ravishing.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You wouldn’t do that.
text: Isaac stubs out his Camel. A bitter laugh.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You know I would’ve done anything for
dialog: you ... Except what I did for you.
text: Then he turns and walks out of the chart room, gesturing for
text: the Orderly to take her away.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - A MINUTE LATER
text: As a distressed Heather is escorted back to her room:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I need to make a call!
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: In the morning, lady ...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: It's a family emergency -- I need to
dialog: phone my sister --!
text: A second Orderly opens the door to Heather’s room -~- a dorn~
text: type arrangement with seven other women -~ and the escorting
text: ordlery roughly pushes her inside.
scene_heading: EXT. KIRBY FORENSIC - NIGHT - SAME TIME
text: Isaac walks out, his body twisted from tension, the pain of a
text: near-migraine evident on his face.
text: He kicks a piece of trash on the steps, and emits a string of
text: frustrated curses. Suddenly --
text: -- a hulking FIGURE steps from out of the shadows, blocking
text: him. Isaac startles.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Isaac Barr?
text: The Black Man from the trial. He’s nearly a head taller than
text: Isaac and twice as wide. He’s smiling, but somehow we’re not
text: reassured. His voice is gutteral, effortlessly threatening.
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: How’s Heather?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Who are you?
text: A beat, then a badge glimmers in Isaac’s frightened face.
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: Huggins. Homicide.
text: Isaac relaxes, but not much.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What can I do for you?
speaker_heading: HUGGINS
dialog: How’s Heather?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: She’s ... fine.
speaker_heading: HUGGINS
dialog: You look upset. Could use a shower,
dialog: too. What’d she tell you ~~ she ain’t
dialog: gonna share the two million with you?
dialog: 88.
text: Isaac’s mind whirls. The silence is punctuated by a lunatic
text: WOMAN'S shrill SCREAMS, from inside the building.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I have a report due in the morning. I
dialog: needed some data, so I --
speaker_heading: HUGGINS
dialog: Don’t yank my dick! Night of the
dialog: murder some stud walked into the
dialog: building with Heather. Hinky thing, no
dialog: one saw this stud walk out.
text: With all the cool he can muster:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Sounds like an interesting lead. Why
dialog: didn’t you follow up on it?
speaker_heading: HUGGINS
text: Doorman’s a pillhead on parole. Geezer
text: who rode upstairs with the happy couple
dialog: is legally blind ... Even if one of ’em
dialog: made an ID, in court it’d be worth zip.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: But you think it was me, with Heather?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: HUGGINS
dialog: At this juncture? I know it was. But
dialog: without a murder weapon I can’t do
dialog: jack. Meantime you’re the expert
dialog: witness. The lawyer’s your best
dialog: friend. The sister’s your patient and
dialog: you're banging the accused. And I
dialog: don’t have a fucking murder weapon.
text: He glowers at Isaac. Who tentatively steps around him.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I wish I could help you with that,
dialog: Detective. Now if you don’t mind, I’m
dialog: going home to take that shower.
text: He steps down, to the cab waiting at the curb.
text: Huggins watches as Isaac’s cab pulls off, into darkness.
speaker_heading: cUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSE ~ NIGHTSTAND
text: As the PHONE on it RINGS. It’s a cute pink phone we’d expect
text: to find in the room of a teenage girl. The clock next to the
text: phone says it’s 7:00 a.m.
text: On the third RING, a hand grabs at the receiver, knocking the
text: clock and several vials of tranquilizers off the nightstand.

dialog: (groggy, hoarse)
dialog: -- What --?
scene_heading: INTERCUT HEATHER, in:
scene_heading: INT. KIRBY FORENSIC - MORNING
text: On the pay phone in the dayroom. The hollows around her eyes

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What did you tell him?
scene_heading: INT. DIANA’S APARTMENT ~ SAME TIME
text: A one-bedroom whose cutesy decor has been eerily overwhelmed
text: by dirty dishes, tossed clothes and old magazines. Like the

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You fool! You fell in love with him!
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Wh-what do you mean? I -~
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You want to tell me how he found out?
text: This brings Diana to full consciousness.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: He found out?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yes, and he said you told hin.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I didn’t tell him shit!
speaker_heading: HEATHER

dialog: cut TO:
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC’S OFFICE ~ THAT AFTERNOON
text: Diana has had a few hours to pull herself together, put her

speaker_heading: ISAAC

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Well like my sister. Even though was

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Did something happen between you two?
text: is silent. Isaac lights a cigarette. Carefully:
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: The kind of stress you’re talking about
dialog: can manifest itself in bizarre ways ...
dialog: In paranoia, that might result in
dialog: certain kinds of mental distortions ...
speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Diana, I think it’s time we had a talk.

speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You know how I feel about Heather. But

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: What? Tell me --

text: lets out a shocked gasp. She can’t speak.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What’s so unfair is, she made you do
dialog: it. Pressured you ... Didn’t she?
text: Diana starts to hyperventilate.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: And now she’s trying to sell you down
dialog: the river.
text: Finally, Diana articulates four strangled words:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: -- but she’s my sister --
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Exactly.

dialog: 92.
text: Isaac and Heather stroll the grounds, bounded by barbed wire,
text: under leaden skies that promise rain.
text: Heather nods at an older woman, standing in the middle of a
text: small grassy area, making weird signs with her hands.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: That’s "LaLa". All night she stands at
dialog: the window mumbling. You can’t sleep.
dialog: When you ask what she’s doing she says
dialog: she’s praying for the Jews ...
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: What did you want to tell me --?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I want to talk to you. Try to make you
dialog: see why I... did what I did. It
dialog: wasn’t for the money, more like ~-
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: For two million? Of course not --
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: ~~ a kind of suicide --
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: ~~ called murder --
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I lashed out at my husband, my
dialog: marriage, myself as victim...
dialog: (more)
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (Cont/d)
dialog: I was crazy ... but not in a way you
dialog: could understand in any clinical --
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Oh, I understand. All my training, my
dialog: experience ... it’s about understanding
dialog: why people do what they do to each
dialog: other. And how they justify it.
text: He lights a Camel, drags deeply on it.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Look, I don’t blame you. I used you
dialog: and I lied to you. But I also fell in
dialog: love with you. That night in your bed,
dialog: you branded me with your tenderness. I
dialog: belong to you --
speaker_heading: ISAAC
text: No. The seduction is over.
text: Heather grabs his cigarette and steals a puff.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You won't listen --
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Yes, I will. Tomorrow, in fact ... I’m
dialog: bringing two Assistant D.A.‘s <-- they’d
dialog: like to hear your whole story, Heather.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’ve been found Not Responsible. Ever
dialog: heard of double jeopardy? I can’t be
dialog: tried twice for the same crime.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: If you’re so sure of that, why is your
dialog: hand shaking?
text: Heather looks down: the cigarette is indeed twitching between
text: her fingers. She drops it, smothers it with her shoe.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Call off the D.A.’s, Isaac. Don’t you
dialog: remember the little lead pipe you held,
dialog: that night in your living room?
text: Isaac’s eyes narrow, as he remembers.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: That was the handle of a dumbbell.
dialog: 94.
text: The grounds around Isaac seem to blur a bit, and almost start
dialog: to spin.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I hoped it wouldn’t come to this. You
dialog: don’t know how sorry I am, that it has.
text: Isaac abruptly leans forward. Gives her a quick, hard kiss.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: We’ll see you tomorrow, at noon.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DIANA’S BEDROOM ~ AFTERNOON (LATER)
text: Diana lies, limp, on the bed. The tv is CHATTERING but she’s
text: studying the ceiling, sunk in daydreams.
text: The phone’s SHRIEK jolts her from her reverie, She grabs it.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: -- What?
scene_heading: INTERCUT HEATHER, in:
scene_heading: INT. KIRBY FORENSIC DAYROOM ~ MORNING
text: On the pay phone again. Resigned, almost tragic, but firm.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Tomorrow. Bring the dumbbell.
text: Diana sits bolt upright.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Because I say to. At noon. Take care
dialog: when you handle it. And be on time.
text: Heather clicks OFF. Diana is motionless for a moment. Then
text: she hangs up.
text: Takes a breath. Stands, and crosses to her closet.
dialog: Very little is hanging: mostly, things have been thrown here
text: -- a pile of dresses, pants, sheets, shirts, and shoes.
text: Diana finds, near the top of the pile, a pair of thin white
text: gloves. She pulls them on.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Okay. The dumbbell.
dialog: 95.
text: Then reaches under the whole pile, feels around ... extracts
dialog: one ... two... three baggies.
text: A beat. And then, from Baggie One she removes the five-inch
text: chrome-plated handle with Isaac’s fingerprints.
text: From Baggie Two, a thick chrome-plated lead disk. Diana
text: screws it onto one of the handle’s threaded ends. Her hands
dialog: are shaking a bit, so this takes some doing.
text: Then she opens Baggie Three. Inside is another such disk.
text: This disk is heavily flecked with what appears to be -- but
text: isn’t -- rust. And there are a few black hairs still stuck
text: to the "rusty" part.
text: Diana retches. Then manages to calm herself ... then decides
text: she’s going to vomit -- runs OUT of FRAME, toward the
text: bathroom, but it’s okay, she’1ll be okay ... She returns, INTO
text: FRAME. Carefully sinks to her knees, and takes the disk ...
text: Starts to screw it onto the handle. But her hand is wildly
text: shaking, she can’t match the threads ... she curses ... and
text: loses her grip on the disk which hits the floor and rolls a
dialog: few feet. Shit!
text: She crawls after it. Touches it and then -- almost as though
text: it was alive -- the horrible bloody disk rolls, another foot!
text: Frustrated and unnerved, Diana brings her gloved hands to her
text: face and SCREAMS.
dialog: cut To:
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY
text: At Kirby. It is conspicuously quiet here. Isaac sits beside
text: two 50ish men in blue suits -- the Assistant D.A.'‘s.
text: Guarded by a burly female Orderly, Heather sits opposite.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I gather you’ve heard his version.
text: A perfunctory nod in Isaac’s direction.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Now are you ready for the truth?
text: The D.A.’s look a tad surprised at her intensity.
speaker_heading: D.A. 1
dialog: Of course, Ms. Evans.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’ve invited my sister. She’ll
dialog: corroborate what I have to say.
text: D.A. 1 nods: that’s fine. To the Orderly:
speaker_heading: DA. 1
dialog: You'll allow Ms. Evans’ sister in, the
text: moment she arrives.
text: He turns back to Heather. In a solicitous tone:
speaker_heading: D.A. 1
dialog: In the meantime, why don’t we begin.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I should have a lawyer present, but my
text: lawyer is his best friend.
text: Again, a nod at Isaac. Trying to conceal her irritation:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I tried to replace him but the Judge
dialog: won't let me ~- because I was recently
dialog: found to be temporarily insane -- so I
dialog: have to defend myself on my own.
speaker_heading: D.A. 2
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Don’t worry, Ms. Evans. We’1ll listen
dialog: carefully and impartially to anything
dialog: you want to tell us.
dialog: Heather's looks says: I wish I could believe that.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: My sister is one of his patients. He
dialog: and I met a few times, to discuss
dialog: family matters. And in the course of
dialog: that, we ... we began an affair.
text: Isaac shakes out a cigarette. Lights it. Nervously puffs.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: When Isaac first suggested killing my
dialog: husband, I thought he was joking. But
dialog: he knew I suffered from pathological
text: intoxication and he became obsessed,
dialog: insisting we had the makings of ...
text: She pauses. It’s tough to articulate such an alien concept.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: -.. the "perfect murder".
dialog: 97.
text: The D.A.‘s make copious notes. Isaac sits, smoking.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: One night Isaac followed me home. He
dialog: was excited, agitated. I begged him to
dialog: leave but he came upstairs and ... he
text: did it. He hit Jimmy. Isaac hit
text: Jimmy, with a dumbbell.
text: The conference room door opens. Diana is led in by a second
text: Orderly, who remains in the room. Diana carries a briefcase.
text: Isaac anxiously eyes it.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I was horrified ... I think Isaac was
dialog: too. He just sort of ran out of the
dialog: apartment, and then he called, Tf don’t
dialog: know, five minutes later from a bar, I
dialog: think. Said I’d better tell the police
dialog: I’d done it... after sipping Nyquil.
text: The D.A.’s gravely stare at Isaac ~~ who gazes at the floor,
text: drops his cigarette, grinds it out.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I =~ did as I was told.
text: She momentarily cracks. Starts to softly cry.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: But I was thinking clearly enough to
dialog: hide the dumbbell Isaac used. I know
dialog: that was wrong -- concealing evidence
dialog: ++ but I’ve been so scared ...
text: It’s too much for her -- she "breaks down".
text: The D.A.’s uncomfortably shift. Isaac puffs. Diana digs
text: into her purse and finds a tissue for her sister.
text: Heather pulls herself together. Between sniffles:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I asked Diana to bring this briefcase
text: today. She doesn’t know what’s inside.
text: A warm sisterly smile.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Sweetie ... Let them have it.
text: Diana dutifully hands the briefcase to the D.A.’s. Isaac
text: watches, tensing as D.A. 2 snaps it open. Pulls out --
dialog: 98.
text: ~~ a sheaf of sketchbook paper.
text: Heather looks confused. She grabs for the briefcase. But
text: there is nothing else inside.
speaker_heading: THE PAPERS
text: Covered with demented scrawls in poster paint. As the D.A.’s
text: leaf through them we note the phrase "Dr. Barr must die", and
text: the name "Isaac" scribbled above the word "Satan", the two
text: connected with arrows.
dialog: This was Bantar Man’s gift to Isaac.
speaker_heading: SCENE
text: Heather angrily grabs at the papers. Then turns on Diana.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: -- Where’s the dumbbell?
text: Her tone is harsh -~ like the voice she’d used in Lutece.
text: Diana cringes.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Where did you get these? From him?
text: Shooting Isaac a lethal look. Then, to the D.A.‘s:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: He’s controlling her. He forced her to
dialog: substitute these paintings.
text: She whirls, again, on Isaac.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: They’re from the planet Bantar, aren’t
dialog: they? —
text: The D.A.’s trade looks.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: How did you get her to bring them,
dialog: Isaac? You’re fucking her, aren’t you?
text: Isaac turns away. Diana, mortified, is staring out a window.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Answer, you bastard!
text: She flies out of her chair, at Isaac. The Ordleries grab and
text: restrain her. Urgently petitioning the deadpan D.A.’s:
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: They’re in this together. Do you see?
dialog: They’re trying to frame me!
speaker_heading: D.A. 2
dialog: Of course, Ms. Evans.
text: D.A. 1 snaps open his own briefcase. Inside are medications
text: and syringes.
text: Heather’s eyes widen as an Orderly yanks up her sleeve.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: ~~ What?
dialog: And now she realizes:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You’re doctors.
text: As "D.A. 1" -- actually Doctor 1 -~ sinks in the syringe:
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 2
dialog: You know we’re doctors ... You're just
text: a little confused right now.
text: Explaining, in infuriatingly gentle tones:
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 1
dialog: I’m with the Forensic Review Committee.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 2
dialog: I consult with your late husband's
dialog: insurance company.
text: Heather starts flailing.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You tricked me. All of you --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 2
dialog: You're very upset, Ms. Evans.
text: Confirming this, as she shouts to no one in particular:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Liar!
text: She struggles to break free. Sotto, to his colleagues:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: If I may ... I know Heather, and I just
dialog: might be able to reach her.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: bocTOR 1
dialog: Please, Doctor.
text: Isaac approaches Heather. She stops struggling to hear what
text: he has to say. Softly, into her ear:
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: You were right about double jeopardy.
dialog: This was the only way.
dialog: Heather freaks.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Sonovobitch bastard -~
text: The Orderlies cart her away. We HEAR the muffled sounds of
text: SCREAMING; they FADE as she’s dragged farther down the hall.
text: Diana is standing, mute and expressionless, in a far corner.
text: Stunned, the two Doctors approach Isaac. Quietly:
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 1
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 2
dialog: When you came in the other day with
dialog: your diagnosis, we were -- well, we
dialog: were skeptical.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 2
dialog: There was no indication of psychosis,
dialog: no prior history. But ...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 1
dialog: She’s worse than you described her.
dialog: Talk about paranoid ... Who did she
dialog: think we were? District Attorneys?
text: Isaac shakes his head -- he’s mystified.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Maybe the anxiety of killing her
dialog: husband -- plus the repeated insults of
dialog: alcohol ~~ have produced a stress~
dialog: related organic psychosis.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I wouldn't be surprised if there was
text: further deterioration.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR 1
dialog: We'll want her reviewed in six months.
dialog: You’re familiar with the case, Dr.
dialog: Barr. You should be on the evaluation
dialog: team.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I’ll try to find the time. But you
dialog: know, these cases can drag on...
dialog: patients remain committed for years.
dialog: The Doctors nod -~ they know. They know.
dialog: cut To:
scene_heading: INT. TAXI (MOVING) ~ AFTERNOON
text: Isaac and Diana. The aftermath: She’s sobbing, remorseful.
text: Isaac pats her knee, attempting to soothe her.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: It’s okay ...
text: Now the Cabbie does a typically wild maneuver -- veering
text: across four lanes -- and Diana’s head is whipped around.
text: Isaac unloads all his tension on the Cabbie:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Could you drive sanely please? We/’d
dialog: like to get there alive.
text: The Cabbie grudgingly slows and Isaac turns back to Diana.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You did the right thing. The only
dialog: thing ...
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: -.. Did I?
text: She wears a doubtful look. Begging for more encouragement.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Now that you’re free of her you can
dialog: finally begin to be ... who you are.
text: The faint trace of a hopeful smile crosses Diana’s lips.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: You’1l see. The caterpillar is going
dialog: to become a butterfly, Diana.
text: Then he adds, as casually as he can:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Meantime, after all that’s happened, we
dialog: should keep our distance for awhile.
text: Diana’s smile flickers, uncertain.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: So no one draws a conclusion that might
dialog: be dangerous to us both.
text: Diana nods: she sees his point.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: So all I need from you is the dumbbell
dialog: back. Then well stay clear of each
dialog: other -~- only for as long as necessary,
dialog: of course.
text: A long beat. Then Diana pulls a Kleenex from her pocketbook,
text: and dries her eyes. Smiles again, rather coyly.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - ISAAC
text: follows Diana up a narrow flight of stairs, into:
scene_heading: INT. DIANA’S APARTMENT ~ DUSK
dialog: Weve been here before and seen how messy it is. Now it’s
text: gotten even worse: piles, everywhere, of clothing, bedding,
text: magazines, unreturned videotapes, dishes and glasses ...
text: Diana seems gaily oblivious to the disorder as she beckons:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Come in. Make yourself comfortable,
text: Isaac cautiously closes the door behind him.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Can I fix you some tea? Camomile?
dialog: Mint?
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: I shouldn’t stay, Diana. I just --
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Right. Of course. The dumbbell.
text: She makes a cute girlish gesture: Be right with you.
text: Still standing by the door -~- ready to make a fast getaway ~-
text: Isaac watches as she moves to her bedroom closet, opens it.
text: Massive clutter. Diana kneels, feels under all the dresses
dialog: and underwear she forgot to hang back up, these past months.
dialog: 103.
text: Then she starts sifting through all that stuff, feeling for
text: the dumbbell.
text: Then she stands. Scowls.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Hmm.
text: Isaac steps forward.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: -~ What?
text: Diana snaps her fingers.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I know. I hid it somewhere better.
dialog: After that detective ...
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Huggins?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (nods)
dialog: After he started calling. And then he
text: came by. Poked around.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Jesus Christ -~
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: He wants it real bad. So I hid it ...
text: A beat, as she concentrates. Then it comes back to her:
speaker_heading: DIANA
text: ... under the mattress.
text: Diana crosses to her bed, leans down, feels under it, frowns.
text: Isaac crosses. Joins her. Feels, too. Nothing.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Shit.
text: She straightens up. Squints at the bed. And remembers:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I couldn’t sleep with it there.
text: She takes in a breath. Surveys her apartment. Exhales.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: The dumbbell, the dumbbell ...
dialog: 104.
text: She starts moving around, throwing stuff off her nightstand,
text: flinging things in the air ...
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Where did I put that dumbbell --?
text: Moving faster, like a dervish through the chaos, upending
text: everything, sending dirty sheets flying, as she murmurs:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It’s here somewhere I know it’s here -~
speaker_heading: ANGLE ISAAC
text: As it starts to sink in that maybe she’s toying with him ...
text: and then he brightens as he HEARS:
speaker_heading: DIANA (0S)
dialog: A-ha!
speaker_heading: ANGLE DIANA
text: As she triumphantly waves it.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I haven’t seen this in weeks!
text: But it’s not the dumbbell she’s found -- it’s Jimmy’s gun!
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Isaac startles as she recklessly waves the .38.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Careful with that --
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Oh the safety’s always on -~
text: BLAM! As the thing discharges, a bullet ZIPPING past Isaac’s
text: ear and EXPLODING a lamp.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: Diana pauses to look at the gun, then at Isaac, to marvel:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I fired it! Finally --!
text: The neighbor below angrily BANGS on the ceiling.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Shuttup!
dialog: (resuming the search)
dialog: Where the hell could it’ve gone? I
dialog: mean dumbbells just don’t up and walk
dialog: out of a girl’s apartment, right -~?
text: She brushes aside empty cereal boxes, discarded shoes ...
text: Isaac now wears a small, ironic smile.
text: Diana, feet firmly planted in the middle of the maelstrom,
text: throws up her arms, extravagantly befuddled.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I just don’t know what to say.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: ... Right.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I’m so embarrassed ... I mean I know
dialog: it’1ll turn up one day ...
dialog: Then, an idea:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Y'know, maybe ... in the course of my
dialog: therapy ... Maybe you’il help me break
dialog: through my defenses and remember where
dialog: I put the damn thing.
text: Isaac just nods. He’s almost amused.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: So. I guess this butterfly will be
dialog: seeing you Tuesday. At the regular
dialog: time ..?
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: See you then, Diana.
text: He starts to turn, to open the door, but:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: And by the way, Daddy fucked Heather,
dialog: not me,
text: This stops Isaac cold.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: He always preferred her -- he wouldn’t
dialog: even let me sit in his lap.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If that helps any.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: It’s all grist for the mill.
text: He turns, now, opens the door. Walks cut, acutely aware that
text: there’s an unstable young woman behind him with a loaded gun.
text: Diana watches her psychiatrist go, wearing a satisfied smile.
text: Which disappears as a thought crosses her mind. She quickly
text: moves to the stove. Opens the oven, to check that the pilot
text: light is still on.
dialog: It is.
text: FADE OUT. Then, Slowly FADE UP ON:
scene_heading: INT. ISAAC’S MOTHER'S BEDROOM ~ EARLY EVENING
text: Some time has passed -- the quality of the light, through the
text: blinds, has changed.
text: Isaac sits on the couch opposite his mother’s bed. They both
text: look thin, pallid. They’re both staring into space.
text: Now Isaac jots some notes, on the legal pad in his lap.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (murmurs, as he
dialog: writes)
dialog: "Trouble sleeping" ... "Appetite loss"
dialog: ».. "Lack of concentration" ...
text: He looks up at his mother.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Yeah, I know what they’re symptomatic
dialog: of ... But I’m not -- How could I be
dialog: +++ ¢’mon, six months later ..? With a
dialog: woman who ... She lied, she -~
text: He's interrupted by the RINGING phone. Then Isaac’s clipped
text: prerecorded MESSAGE, followed by:
speaker_heading: O’BRIEN’S VOICE
dialog: Hey. Howard Hughes. What’re you, not
dialog: showing up again?
text: In b.g., we HEAR the DIN of a CROWD. O’Brien is calling from
text: a public phone in a stadium, it sounds like. Next, we HEAR:
speaker_heading: ALAN’S VOICE
dialog: Can’t you be a tad less borderline?
text: Gooden’s starting against the Dodgers.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: O’BRIEN’S VOICE
dialog: We're waiting, schmuck.
text: With that, he clicks off.
text: At first, Isaac doesn’t move. Then, abruptly, with a sudden
text: sense of purpose, he rises.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: I’1l call Gretschen. I should go.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: To the baseball game, where else?
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAYROOM - EVENING (LATER)
text: Exercise class. A dozen women stretch, bend, etc. Most are
text: stiff, out of shape. Some make bizarre gestures in the air.
text: All look shabby and desperate, in this dingy, awful dayroom.
text: Heather slouches, in the corner. Tired and pale, but still
dialog: possessed of grace and beauty. Her strategy for coping is,
text: apparently, to pretend that she’s not here.
dialog: She’s on a beach in the south of France -~ we can almost read
text: it in her eyes.
speaker_heading: ANGLE DOOR
text: A man’s face, jaw set tight, in the mesh pane. Staring into
text: the room -- at Heather.
dialog: Isaac Barr.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING (LATER)
text: A windowless little room -- a cell, really ~- where Isaac has
text: come to visit Heather in his role as "Evaluator".
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Are you having trouble sleeping?
text: There is a rudimentary desk between them, a lamp on the desk.
text: Her head is down -- her hair hangs, a little greasy, in front
text: of her face. Concealing, like a curtain.
text: No answer from across the desk. In a clinical voice:
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: At night. Do you find you have trouble
dialog: sleeping?
dialog: 108.
text: Finally, a response. Muted, but distinct:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: {beat ~~ then,
dialog: neutral)
dialog: Please answer my question.
text: Heather looks up. Her lovely face is streaked with tears.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I love you.
text: Isaac stares at her for a beat. Then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Have you experienced loss of appetite?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: TSAAC
dialog: Difficulty concentrating?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (stands)
dialog: Stop it. Answer truthfully --
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: (erupts)
dialog: If you’d told me the truth, I could/ve
dialog: helped you ... You couldn’t just leave
dialog: Jimmy any more than you could’ve walked
dialog: away from your father ~-- I understand
dialog: that now, I could’ve helped you, but --
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Enough! Tell me the truth for once.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Dammit! The truth --
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I love you.
dialog: Isaac
dialog: Bullshit! The truth!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: It’s true.
text: The realization hits Isaac like a punch to the gut -~ almost
text: knocking him back, against the wall.
text: Two beats. His voice, now, is as muted and fragile as hers.
speaker_heading: ISAAC
dialog: Christ ... What do we do ..?
text: As she silently looks at him, and he at her, CAMERA SLOWLY
text: starts to rise ... higher and higher ...
text: Revealing walls that are twenty, thirty, forty ... fifty feet
dialog: tall, and more ... until we are looking down on these two, as
text: from a great height, a pair of mice trapped in a mineshaft --
text: The CAMERA is still RISING as we slowly FADE to BLACK.
dialog:
