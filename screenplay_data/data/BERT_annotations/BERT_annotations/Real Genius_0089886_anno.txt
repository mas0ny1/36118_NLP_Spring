dialog: EXT. SKY-DAY
dialog: A Black B-1 Bomber banks steeply exposing its underside to us.
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O./FILTERED)
dialog: Slingshot this is Watchdog. Rabbit's home.
text: Rolling out of its bank, the bomber begins a steep climb revealing the fact that it is carrying a small delta winged shuttle on it back. The bomber's wings slide back.
speaker_heading: BOMBER PILOT (V.O./FILTERED)
dialog: Roger watchdog. Understand we are go for crossbow.
text: Suddenly a rocket engine on the back of the modified bomber fires thrusting the plane into steep climb.
dialog: INT. B-1 FLIGHT DECK-DAY
text: THE PLANE VIBRATES. The pilot and co-pilot are busy in their seats. Behind them sits a third pilot wearing a space suit. He gives them a thumbs-up signal, rises and crawls to the rear.
speaker_heading: BOMBER PILOT
dialog: (into the mike/ over the roar)
dialog: Watchdog, Slingshot. let us know when the rabbit's in the hole.
dialog: EXT. A CROWD-DAY
text: A blond haired, blue-eyed man with a small walkie-talkie is standing in the midst of a group of cheering Central American peasants and townsfolk. He is disguised as one of them.
dialog: ANGLE ON VILLA BALCONY
text: The uniformed President of this formerly sleepy, now strategically critical nation is waving to his people. He is flanked by military guards. He turns and walks into the villa.
speaker_heading: EXT. B-1 BOMBER-DAY
dialog: The bomber approaches the top of it's arc.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
text: The shuttle pilot climbs into his seat, straps in and checks his instruments.
dialog: SHUTTLE PILOT
dialog: All systems check. Crossbow is armed.
speaker_heading: BOMBER PILOT (V.O.)
dialog: Roger, Ignition sequence, start, separation in five...
dialog: EXT. TOP OF THE BOMBER
dialog: The explosive bolts blow on the shuttle mount.
dialog: INT. BOMBER FLIGHT DECK
dialog: The pilot pushes his yolk forward.
dialog: EXT. BOMBER
text: As the bomber falls way, the shuttle's booster ignites with a roar, thrusting it toward space.
dialog: EXT. SPACE-LOOKING BACK
text: We see a tiny glowing speck coming towards us. very quickly it gains in altitude and we see that it is the shuttle. Suddenly it is upon us and blasts over our heads.
speaker_heading: ANGLE FROM BEHIND
text: We follow the shuttle. The engine stops. There is a small explosion, which pushes the booster rocket away. Small maneuvering rockets fire and the shuttle establishes itself in a nose down altitude.
speaker_heading: SHUTTLE PILOT (V.O. FILTERED)
dialog: Crossbow is established.
speaker_heading: BOMBER PILOT (V.O./FILTERED)
dialog: Roger, we have ground confirmation. Reference grid seven. Check pathfinder, on.
speaker_heading: SHUTTLE PILOT (V.O. FILTERED)
dialog: Roger, I'm going on the scope. Moving Target Indicator, engage.
text: Behind and above the cockpit a large hatch opens and a large circular spinning mirror rises and locks into position.
dialog: INT. SHUTTLE
text: The pilot reaches above him and pulls down a viewfinder and begins looking through it.
dialog: EXT. THE SHUTTLE.
text: A target sighting lens moves from right to left, stops, and then moves back but this time with the mirror moving in unison.
dialog: INT. THE SHUTTLE
text: While still looking through the viewfinder, the pilot manipulates the targeting controls.
dialog: INSERT
dialog: PILOT'S POV OF THE SCREEN
text: Crosshairs, a grid patter and digital, rangefinder readouts appear over various parts of the Earth's topography as the pilot searches for his target. Then it steadies on a polarized image of a group of people. One of the images seems to stand out brighter than the others.
dialog: EXT. VILLA PATIO-DAY
text: The president and his aide are chatting with a group of visiting dignitaries. There is a jovial atmosphere as they order drinks from a waiter. The president is proudly displaying one of his medals to his guests. it has a very unique jewel-like object in its middle.
dialog: INT. THE SHUTTLE
dialog: The pilot is watching through the viewfinder.

dialog: INT. THE SHUTTLE
text: The pilot puts his hands on the joysticks and flips open the trigger covers.
dialog: PILOT
dialog: Nice and easy does it.
dialog: EXT. THE SHUTTLE
text: Dead silence, then the mirror erupts in brilliant light and sends an incredibly bright beam toward the Earth. Behind the shuttle we see exhaust gases venting in giant plumes into space.
dialog: EXT. VILLA PATIO
text: The beam strikes the president like the finger of god. He vaporizes. The waiter turns back with the asked-for sugar to find a smoking hole where the President once stood.
dialog: EXT. SPACE
text: The shuttle finishes its work and the beam shuts down. The mirror folds away and the shuttle arcs across the screen preparing for re-entry, firing small retro rockets.
speaker_heading: PILOT (V.O)
dialog: I'm coming home. Just like shooting ducks in a barrel.
dialog: PULL BACK TO REVEAL
scene_heading: INT. A HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENT CONFERENCE ROOM-NO WINDOWS
text: A large screen at one end of the room continues to show the re-entry.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: The Crossbow Project. There's no defense like a good offense.
text: In the middle of the room is a giant donut of a round conference table. Another circle hangs above and casts light downward in such a way as to light the table-top but caser those sitting around it in shadow. We can see them but not well. There are SIX MEN in suits. The look is sinister as Hell; but the talk is for Rotary Club meeting.
text: A MAN, sitting at three o'clock, wearing an Air force major's uniform, points at a remote control device at the screen and stops the film. The lighting does not change. he turns to the man sitting at twelve o'clock.
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: Nice little weapon isn't it, Dave?
dialog: DECKER
dialog: Well, I guess so, but gosh, Don, it's a movie. You want me to start buying weapons from George Lucas?
dialog: Polite laughter all around.
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: Now that would be somethin', wouldn't it?
dialog: DECKER
dialog: Well, sometimes I think I might as well.
dialog: (to one of the others)
dialog: What do you think of what you saw, Roy?
dialog: ROY
dialog: I think there weren't enough girls.
dialog: More polite laughter. Then Roy turns ice cold in a flash.
dialog: ROY (cont'd)
dialog: Is this thing for biological targets only?
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: No, Sir, this thing would take the skin right off, of Air Force One if you wanted. Not that I'm saying we'd ever want to kill our own President, but, you know, for example.
dialog: ROY
dialog: Our studies indicate that this type of weapon is totally useless for warfare.
dialog: DECKER
dialog: It's not intended for use in your kind of warfare, Roy. This is a perfect peace time weapon.
dialog: ROY
dialog: What's the kill potential?
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: As soon as the size-to power ratio is licked we'll have about seven bangs for the buck.
dialog: ROY
dialog: When that?
dialog: Carmichael shrugs the sign for "who knows?"
dialog: DECKER
dialog: Seriously, Don, I have to report to the Secretary that everything's on schedule. We have plans for your little ray's gun this summer.
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: (Trying to cover)
dialog: As I understand it, guys, there's some major practical difficulties. I'm pushing as hard as I can.
dialog: DECKER
dialog: Well, Don, you tell those geniuses you've got until the end of the next fiscal quarter to come up with a working model or I'm pulling the plug on the funding.
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: (very nervous)
dialog: I'm assured they're on the verge of a major breakthrough.
dialog: DECKER
dialog: Good. Just as long as we get a working weapon out of it by June. Right, general?
dialog: ROY
dialog: I wouldn't know, Dave. I haven't had a working weapon since Korea.
dialog: DECKER
dialog: Right.
dialog: (to assistant)
dialog: Larry, let's see the film on blinding techniques, then we'll have some lunch, all right?
speaker_heading: INT. EXHIBITION HALL -DAY
text: WE OPEN on a sign: "Effects of marijuana on Rodents." A cage is divided in half. One side is marked "NO Marijuana." A chinchilla is running furiously on a treadmill. The other side is marked "Marijuana." A chinchilla is lying in a little hammock.
text: DOLLY BACK TO WIDE SHOT. We see we are in a large hall. There are dozens of booths and exhibits. A banner strung across the hall lets us know that this is the "WESTERN REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL WINTER SCIENCE FAIR."
text: ANGLE ON a pretty female student at a booth standing in front of a clear glass cylinder that has vacuum hoses connected to it. There are two colored gases inside the cylinder. A sign behind her says: HOW TORNADOS ARE FORMED." A small group of boys stand watching her in as sexist a way as possible.
dialog: GIRL
dialog: It doesn't seem to be working; but if it was, these gases would be going around.
dialog: A BOY
dialog: We don't care.
text: ANGLE ON another part of the hall. Two blond-haired, male twins stand proudly in their booth. "THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF HEAVENLY BODIES." A large, crudely painted diorama of the Milky Way is in the background. Several painted balls are suspended in front, labeled "Mercury," "Venus," etc. The sun is represented by a large electromagnet. All the "planets"
text: ANGLE ON a booth near the entrance. A ROBOT attracts a crowd. It has a video screen for a face which reads: "Hi, my name is Harry. Let me guess your weight and age." With jerky motions he extends his mechanical arms and shakes hands with passersby. He is speaking to a small KID.
dialog: HARRY
dialog: Hi, my name is Harry. Let me guess your weight and age...midget mutant; weight...
text: The kid shoots it in the neck with a toy space gun. The ROBOT SHORT CIRCUITS: sparks shoot out, its arms fly in circles until a FUSE BLOWS and it SIZZLES to a burning stop.
text: WE PAN OVER TO the door just in time to see the entrance of DR. JERRY ATHERTON, professor of physics at Pacific Tech, and a popular host of a PBS television show about science. His manner and bearing mark him as a classic anal retentive. He is a perfect cross between Carl Sagan and Jerry Brown. Brilliant, intense, seemingly sincere but, in fact, incredibly manipulative. There is an intentional aura of superiority surrounding him.
text: We FOLLOW him in and down an aisle where he draws the attention of the crowd in the manner of the celebrity he is. An OLD LADY stops him. He beams a smile at her.
dialog: OLD LADY
dialog: Are you Dr. Atherton?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Yes, dear.
dialog: OLD LADY
dialog: I just love your television show.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Well, thank you. We try.
dialog: OLD LADY
dialog: What's Albert Einstein really like?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Dead.
dialog: OLD LADY
dialog: Oh, I thought you had him on.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: No, that was just an actor.
dialog: OLD LADY
dialog: Is everyone an actor, then?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (beginning to tire of this)
dialog: No, I'm a physicist.
dialog: OLD LADY
dialog: But Einstein isn't?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (dismissing her)
dialog: Nice talking to you.
dialog: He walks away.
text: ANGLE ON a booth where we meet MITCH SIMON, aged fifteen. Mitch is a genius. He's known that since he was old enough to understand the word, which was on his first birthday. He was doing college level work by the time he was in the fourth grade. Although he's intellectually precocious, he's still only 15 years old and has all the problems of any average adolescent. His shyness and intellect have always made him feel different and uncomfortable in social situations.
text: He stands with his PARENTS near a demonstration table. Unlike some of the other exhibits we've seen, there is nothing amateurish about this one. In fact, it is an impressive display of a dye laser. We can see the beams of multi-colored rays bouncing between mirrors, moving through liquids, combining with gases.
dialog: MITCH is trying to explain his work to MR. SIMON, who is a nice enough guy but who pretty much regards the fact that his son is gifted as a pain in the butt.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: See, Dad, it's coherent light.
dialog: MR. SIMON
dialog: It talks?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No.
text: ATHERTON APPROACHES. He is seen by MRS. SIMON, who greets him.
dialog: MRS. SIMON
dialog: Dr. ATHERTON, what a surprise.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Hello, Mrs. Simon. How are you?
dialog: MR. SIMON
dialog: No problem with Mitch's test scores or anything, is there?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: No, no. I just thought I'd stop by, bring you the good news myself. I just got word from the admissions committee. We did it. Mitch is in.
dialog: MRS. SIMON
dialog: Isn't that wonderful.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Hello, Mitch.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (shyly)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Nice little display?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Thanks
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: What's your medium?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Just Argon. But I have it all structured for HF if I could get some.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: That would be interesting.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: It's all theoretical at this stage, but I have the power supply completely worked out.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Very nice.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (a kid again)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: ATHERTON turns to Mitch's parents.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: You must be very proud. he's the first student we've ever accepted for winter term entrance at Pacific Tech.
dialog: MR. SIMON
dialog: I image he's the youngest, too.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: No, actually. The youngest we've had was a twelve, but he cracked under the pressure within six months so we don't really count him.
dialog: MRS. SIMON
dialog: (almost in tears)
dialog: Fifteen year old and off to college. Image.
dialog: MR. SIMON
dialog: Listen Doc. This scholarship thing, does he get any kind of whatya call it, signing bonus sort of thing?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (hoping this is not going to be a problem)
dialog: Well, no...but by allowing Mitch to progress at an accelerated rate we give him the opportunity to fulfill a far greater portion of his remarkable intellectual potential. Don't you agree?
dialog: MR. SIMON
dialog: Yeah, I guess. It's just that athletes get, you know, cars and stuff.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (polite for Mitch's sake)
dialog: Well, I guess we scientists are a little different than athletes.
dialog: MR. SIMON
dialog: Cheaper.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Smarter
dialog: MR. SIMON
dialog: Not when it comes to getting cars.
dialog: MRS. SIMON
dialog: We just want the best for Mitchie.
dialog: (changing gears)
dialog: Dr. Atherton, I saw your show the other night, about radioactive isotopes, and I have a question for you.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Oh, yes?
dialog: MRS. SIMON
dialog: Is that your real hair?
dialog: MR. SIMON
dialog: Well, I wondered that, too.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (struggling for manners)
dialog: Well, interesting question, when you consider the philosophical aspects of whether anything on television is "real" or actually just an "image" being broadcast.
dialog: MR. SIMON
dialog: Didn't look real. Anyway, listen, I got to get something to eat or I'm gonna die.
dialog: MRS. SIMON
dialog: Come on, let's look for something.
dialog: They start away.
speaker_heading: MRS. SIMON (cont'd)
dialog: I saw over there one of the kids was doing an experiment with insect protein.
dialog: MR. SIMON
dialog: Did you see anyone doing anything with corned beef?
dialog: They exit.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Your parents...
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: They're...nice
dialog: MITCH
dialog: They're Okay. They just sometimes don't have any idea of what I'm talking about.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: I'm sure of that. Afraid you're going to miss your friends?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No. I don't have any. I think I intimidate other kids.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Good boy.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I don't want to.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Remember, compared to you, most people have the IQ of a carrot. We're different than most people, Mitch, but you should be proud of that. I mean, look around. From now on, you'll BE amongst peers, colleagues. I suppose I might as well tell you now, I've put you on my personal research team. Some of the finest minds on campus, not the least of which is, of course, my own.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: It sounds great.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Well, now, I'm expecting great things from you, my boy. This is only the second time I've given this honor to a freshman. The first was...
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Chris Kinsley.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: You know Chris?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No, but he's a legend in the Physics Club.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Well, you're going to become a legend yourself. You'll be working with Chris. He's a senior now but he's still on the team and still as brilliant as ever.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Wow.
scene_heading: INT. PACIFIC ELECTRONICS INSTRUMENTS-DAY
text: We see CHRIS KINSLEY, Chris has on his head a pair of those jiggling antennae-like things. WE PULL BACK to revel that he is on a tour of the facilities.
text: A huge hanger-like room filled with workers constructing and assembling scientific instruments. This place has the look and feel of the Big Time.
text: Workers put the finishing touches on a communication SATELLITE. Passing through this Disneyland of Science is a well-dressed executive. ROBERT JENSEN, who is guiding Chris on the tour. Chris was heralded as one of the smartest people to ever enter Pacific Tech. He proved to be even smarter than many of his professors. He also proved to be one of the most outrageous people to ever enter Pacific Tech. his antics are legend. Unimpressed with authority, pomposity and bullshit in general., Chris dresses on the sloppy side of life. Currently he's wearing a sports jacket that's seen better days, over a faded sweatshirt that has the logo "I ? Toxic Waste."
text: They approach a second executive/scientist, MIKE DODD, who is wearing a lab coat, and a beautiful public relations executive named SHERRY NUGIL, who is also wearing a lab coat but in a whole new way.
dialog: JENSEN
dialog: (as they approach the couple)
dialog: Guys, I want you to meet Chris Kinsley. Chris, this is Sherry Nugil, my assistant, and Mike Dodd.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Dr. Dodd?
dialog: JENSEN
dialog: He's the man who just designed the new Telcom Satellite here.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I know. Nice to meet you Dr. Dodd. Isn't the Telcom raining debris all over Europe?
dialog: DODD
dialog: (smiling, but angry)
dialog: That was a launch problem, not a design problem. Why are you wearing that toy on your head?
dialog: Chris takes the thing from his head.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Oh, this. Sorry, I was worried that people would think I was stuffy, You know, no fun; all brain, no penis,
dialog: JENSEN
dialog: Pardon?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I'm sorry, it's just an infantile response to authority.
dialog: JENSEN
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Yes. you are Chris Kinsley, aren't you?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: No. Well, yes. I mean, I used to be. Now I'm Mhavishnue Kinsley.
dialog: JENSEN
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: I see. You are being funny.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Well, I just can't help it. You're such a fun guy yourself.
dialog: JENSEN
dialog: Oh yes. I think you'll find we all are, right Mike?
dialog: DODD
dialog: No.
dialog: JENSEN
dialog: Now Chris, Sherry is going to show you around the place. She can answer any questions you might have about fringe benefits or dress codes or anything and I'll see you back upstairs when you're done, okay? Sherry, take good care of this young man. He's one of the ten finest minds kin the country.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Someday I hope to be two of them.
dialog: JENSEN
dialog: See you later.
dialog: Jensen and Dodd exit.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: You are very beautiful.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: You don't act like one of the top ten minds in America.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Oh, really? How many of them have you met?
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: (with a really dirty look in her eye)
dialog: Seven.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Really?
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: You'll be eight. Six was Professor Hostetler at M.I.T.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Old Professor Hostetler? Isn't he dead?
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: He is now.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PEI FACILITY- ALITTLE LATER
dialog: Sherry and Chris stare intently into one another's eyes.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: And so, coupled with full insurance coverage and bonus plans, you find it adding up to a fairly sizable perks package.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I have a pretty sizable perks package right now.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: Also, we understand that you people don't care too much for rigid timetables, and that's pretty rare in private industry.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: So are you.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: Is it true that school of yours keeps getting smarter and smarter kids every year?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Yup! I mean no!
scene_heading: INT. YET ANOTHER PART OF PEI- A LITTLE LATER.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: You see the funding associations are the same. Our theoretical work is in the Blue Sky sector as well.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: You have no idea how much I need that kind of continuity in my life right now.
dialog: INT. CATWALK ABOVE A HUGH LAB- A LITTLE LATER STILL
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: You just belong here, Chris. We have several of Dr. Atherton's former students and they're all doing quite well with us.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: What number was he?
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: Two. One of his other students was four.

dialog: And Gym.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: Please.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: What's your research with Artherton?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Ultra-high power laser as an energy force for fusion. Tremendous boon to all mankind. And womankind, too.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: Fusion, more fusion.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: It's the process for obtaining enormous amounts of energy from forms of hydrogen, like Deuterium and Tritium.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: Oh, my God, more.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Extracting the fuels is no problem.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: Hmmmm.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Getting them to combine and release the energy is the problem.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: Oohh, yes
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: It takes temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius.
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: Oh, God.

dialog: EXT. PACIFIC TECH CAMPUS-DAY
text: It is an impressive campus of older California Spanish building mixed with modern architectural marvels. This is the Sunday before the beginning of the Winter Term.
text: We pick up MITCH SIMON and FOLLOW him as he crosses campus. He is wearing a tie and jacket, which only adds to his general sense of being out of place. He is carrying a map which he stops to consult every now and again. He stops an upper classman and asks him a question while pointing at the map. The older asks him a question while pointing at the map. The older student takes great delight in turning the map right side up.
dialog: EXT. PRESIDENT'S HOUSE-AFTERNOON
text: The tasteful and elegant official residence of the university's President. DR. EUGENE MEREDITH. MITCH approaches the open front door, where he is greeted by MRS. MEREDITH.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Good afternoon. I'm looking for
dialog: (reading from the invitation in his hand)
dialog: the President's Freshman Tea.
dialog: MRS. MEREDITH.
dialog: (leading him inside)
dialog: Oh, good. I'm so glad we have one then. Who are you?
dialog: INT. THE HOUSE-CONTINOUS
dialog: They pass through on their way to the backyard.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Mitch Simon.
dialog: MRS. MEREDITH.
dialog: Oh yes. You're the special case. I know Gene wants to meet you. You're just in time for his traditional talk. Would you like a glass of sherry?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I'm a minor.
dialog: MRS. MEREDITH.
dialog: Aha, well of course you are. That would explain your height.
dialog: They exit out onto the patio.
dialog: EXT. THE PATIO AND GROUNDS OF THE HOUSE-CONTINUOUS
text: The returning freshman class has gathered for a social. Mitch is the only one in a tie. He stands on the patio with Mrs. Meredith whose husband, the apparently ever-jovial professional academic administrator, is about to speak to the assembled.
dialog: MEREDITH
dialog: People, if I might get your attention.
dialog: The din begins to quiet.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Welcome back, freshmen! I take it you all put the Christmas break to good use?
dialog: There is good-natured jeering.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (CONT'D)
text: Now, if you'll indulge me, I'd like to speak seriously for a moment. You will recall that when I welcomed you to the Pacific institute of Technology a few short months ago I spoke of how we are one of the finest scientific institutions in the world. I think the finest. I mentioned our six Nobel Prize winners, our members of the national Academy of Sciences, and our members of the National Academy of Engineering. This is an intellectual oasis of technological achievement in the dessert of general academic mediocrity we see inmost colleges and universities today.
dialog: There is some applause and good-natured banter. Mitch is truly moved. This environment is exactly what Mitch has hoped for all his life.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: I also spoke of the fact that you are the finest freshmen class we have ever had here.
dialog: There are cheers and applause.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: I say this to every freshman class. Each year we raise our entrance requirements and each year there is a group of students like you who meet and surpass those requirements.
dialog: Almost jubilant cheering and clapping.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: As you have no doubt already noticed by now, over a third of you are gone. By the end of the year another third of you will have followed them out of Eden and into mediocrity.
dialog: The crowd goes deathly silent as Meredith continues in his cherry manner.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: We want only the best. Hard work and high standards are expected of everyone. And if you aren't up to it Cal tech or M.I.T. might take you, but you don't fit in here.
speaker_heading: MEREDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me remind you that this place is an opportunity, not a right; a chance not a gift; a working lunch, not a picnic. Welcome back.
text: Several waitresses begin serving tea but the despair of reality creeps over the students and they begin to disperse. Mitch stands waiting for the approaching Dr. Meredith.
dialog: MRS. MEREDITH
dialog: Gene, this is Mitch Simon.
dialog: MEREDITH
dialog: Oh, yes, Professor Artherton's bright star.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: MEREDITH
dialog: And I understand you're already on his project. I'm assured you're going to do great things.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I hope so.
dialog: MEREDITH
dialog: Let me give you some advice.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: MEREDITH
dialog: Don't screw up.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Okay. I guess I better go now.
dialog: He walks away.
dialog: MEREDITH
dialog: (watching Mitch with satisfaction)
dialog: I think the young people really appreciate my " getting down" verbally, don't you?
dialog: MRS. MEREDITH
dialog: Absolutely.
dialog: EXT. CAMPUS-LATER
text: Once again Mitch, map in hand, must ask another student for directions. This one also turns the map right-side up and then points to the building they are standing in front of. As he heads for it he passes a bronze bust of one of the founding fathers, DR. BRADFORD. The students have decorated him with a muffler, earmuffs and carrot nose to look like a snowman.
scene_heading: INT. APPLIED PHYSICS BUILDING-MOMENTS LATER
text: Mitch walks down a long corridor. He passes several open doors that reveal laboratories with all kinds of scientific equipment all over them.
text: Mitch stops in front of a closed door. He checks the number, then looks down at a card in his hand. He turns the card right-side up. He OPENS the door to REVEAL a darkened lab. In the darkness there is a veritable light show of laser beams. A voice calls out from the darkness.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.C.)
dialog: Hey!
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.C.)
dialog: Come in here.
dialog: INT. LAB-CONTINUOUS
text: Mitch ENTERS quickly and shuts the door behind himself. In the instrument glow we can make out the forms of three other students. They are: KENT, CARTER and BODIE, members of Dr. Atherton's research team.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Just leave the sandwiches and go.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Me?
dialog: KENT
dialog: No, Yoda; yeah, you.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I don't have any ah...
dialog: CARTER
dialog: Brains?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No, sandwiches.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Well then, what good are you?
dialog: CARTER
dialog: What are we supposed to eat?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (getting a little fed up)
dialog: How about my shorts.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Hey! Who do you think you're talking to?
text: The laser snaps off and the lights snap on. The glare is a little intense at first.
speaker_heading: KENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you from the restaurant or not?
text: With the lights on we get a chance to have a better look at the team. Kent is an elitist, intellectual snob with very little imagination who likes to think of himself as Atherton's protégé. He wears braces on his teeth because he knows how important a proper smile can be in the marketplace.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No. I'm Mitch Simon. I'm a student. Dr. Atherton told me to come up here.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Oh, you're the new stud, are you. Or is it dud?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: How do you mean?
dialog: BODIE
dialog: Stud. Hot shot. Brain. You're the twelve-year-old, right?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I'm fifteen.
dialog: CARTER
dialog: Does your body know that?
dialog: Mitch attempts a good-natured laugh. It's not a great attempt.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Are you expecting him or...
dialog: KENT
dialog: Sure. Can I get you something? A balloon?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Are any of you guys Chris Kinsley?
dialog: They all freeze.
dialog: KENT
dialog: No, Thank God.
dialog: CARTER
dialog: Hey Kent, I hear Kinsley got that PEI job all locked up.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Damn! I wanted that job.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Why?
dialog: KENT
dialog: Why? Because it starts at fifty thousand a year, that's why. Plus travel, car, stock options...
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Oh. Well, I'm supposed to have a look at your work up to date. Check it over.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Check it over.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Yes.
dialog: KENT
dialog: For what?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Mistakes, I guess. He said you guys are stuck.
dialog: The room goes rigid. Evidently this little punk of an upstart needs to be told what Christ died for.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Let's get something very clear here. Everything you've heard about the supportive student body and the honor code might hold for the rest of the campus, but it doesn't count for squat in here. Which means when jerry's not here, you do what I say. From God to Jerry to me, get it?
dialog: Atherton ENTERS.
speaker_heading: KENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi Jerry.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: I've told you before, Kent, you don't get to use my first name.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Did I?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Good to see you, Mitch.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: I'm sure you're all going to become fast friends.
dialog: KENT
dialog: We're well on our way already.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Good, because after Mitch is brought up to date, I want the rest of you to take your cues from him. He'll be in charge of the group.
dialog: KENT
dialog: What? I mean, good choice, Jerry.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: You're doing it again, Kent.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Am I?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Where's Chris?
dialog: KENT
dialog: He didn't bother to come in today.
dialog: BODIE
dialog: He said he didn't feel like it; and then I said 'you better'; and then he said ' or what?'; and then I said ' or he'd get the heck,' and then he said 'jam it, it's Sunday' and he looks for God on Sundays; so I said 'okay, but I'm telling.'
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Thank you Bodie. I notice you've stopped stuttering.
dialog: BODIE
dialog: Yes, I've been giving myself some sock treatment and it's working.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Good.
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: I'm sorry he isn't here. I wanted you to meet your hero.
dialog: CARTER
dialog: Hero? That clown? Look at this.
text: He points to a table full of laser equipment comprised of various angled mirrors and gas cambers and drib units. The others gather around it.
dialog: CARTER (Cont'd)
dialog: We heard he wasn't coming in. Kent and I figured we'd go ahead and run his section without him. And we started getting picosecond ratings that aren't even in the ballpark.
dialog: KENT
dialog: It looks like it'll take at least a week to re-do all this and start again.
dialog: Mitch is carefully studying the equipment and checking some notes that were on the table.
speaker_heading: KENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Another costly mistake.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: CARTER
dialog: Positive.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Positive.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (reading from notes)
dialog: Negative.
dialog: (innocently, to Carter and Kent)
dialog: There's a mistake all right, but I think you guys made it. Look, you inverted the last two steps.
dialog: CARTER
dialog: (grabbing the notes)
dialog: I don't make mistakes...
dialog: (reading)
dialog: ...Usually.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Damnit, don't touch other people's things.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (adjusting the equipment)
dialog: This shouldn't take too long to fix.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: I'm glad that you were here, Mitch.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Yes, thanks for pointing out Carter's mistake, Mitch.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Don't bother with that now. I'm sure you want to go get settled.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Well, it has been kind of a long day.
dialog: Atherton starts to leave.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Oh, I forgot Kent, I need your help.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Anything, Jerry.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Stop it.
dialog: KENT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Get copies made of everything so young Mitch here can get started checking everything tomorrow.
dialog: KENT
dialog: My pleasure.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: And then, on your way back, stop at my cleaners.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Don't give it a thought. I enjoy it.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Shall we?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Sure.
dialog: Atherton exits, followed by Mitch.
dialog: BODIE
dialog: I guess it goes from God to Jerry to you to the cleaners, right Kent?
dialog: EXT. DORM HALL- LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: Mitch enters the arched column portico of this dormitory building.
dialog: INT. ROOM
text: The room is small, cramped, and more than a little disheveled. PEI, NASA and science fiction posters hang on the ceiling and wall, over and around one of the two beds. Junk food and soft drink containers are littered everywhere. In one corner is a fully-stocked Frito Lay Chip display.
text: Mitch crosses to his bed and sits. He is exhausted and depressed. The door opens and Mitch see a strange, tall, bulkily- built, hermit-looking kind of a guy enter. He is carrying a McDonald's bag. He stops when he see Mitch and stares at him in a quirky way for a second, then crosses to the closet, opens the door and exits into it.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Hello?
dialog: Getting no response, Mitch rises, goes to the closet, opens it and looks in.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Hello?
dialog: There is no one there.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: What kind of place is this?
text: Mitch crosses to his luggage. he opens a bag and, to his surprise, he finds it empty. he then looks in the other bag and find they've all been cleaned out. Puzzled, he shuts the bags.
text: Suddenly, the door swings open and CHRIS KINSLEY , who we saw earlier at PEI, ENTERS. He's dragging a large piece of mechanical equipment. it is, in fact, a baseball pitching machine.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Hi.
dialog: Mitch stares.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, you just gonna sit there admiring the room or are you going to help me with this?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: What is this thing?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: It's a penis stretcher. You want to try it out?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No!
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Oh really? Well, congratulations, then, No, It's an Iron Mike.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: What?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: A baseball pitching machine.
dialog: Chris is setting it up.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I was here for a second this morning...
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: You didn't straighten the place up, did you?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (looks around at the mess)
dialog: No.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Good. 'Cause all my filth's in alphabetical order.
dialog: Chris puts on a baseball cap and grabs a bat.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Anyway, I dropped off my luggage and now all my bags are empty.
text: A ball is pitched. Chris connects and the ball smashes through the window.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I put your stuff away for you.
dialog: Another pitch. He smashes a ball into a wall.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's all in the bottom drawer. Shirts, pants, underwear, shoes. I had a little trouble with your sport jacket, so I threw it out. Nah, only kidding. This one's for you, little Johnny.
text: He whacks another pitch. He does a crowd cheer and circles the bases.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: What a game. I'm Chris Kinsley.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Oh, no.
dialog: INT. MOVING CAR- SAME TIME
text: Dr. Atherton is riding in a rental car with DON CARMICHAEL, a government contract monitor. These two guys are part of an old boy network involved with research and development.
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: We're falling way behind, Jer.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Well, we're not making cheese sandwiches here, you know, Don.
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: That's a good one. I'll have to remember to use that, Jer.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: The new boy is quick.
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: He better be because the company needs a practical working model within four months.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: You can't dictate innovation.
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: Let me put this another way, Jer. You know all that money we've been spending for development?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Yes
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: Well, when a project gets cut off, the finance boys always run an audit.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: I see.
text: The car pulls up to Atherton's house, where there is a great deal of construction going on. Once the work is completed, this is going to be beautifully restored, rather large Victorian home.
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: (looking out)
dialog: Having a little work done on the old place, are you? Looks nice.
dialog: INT. MITCH'S ROOM-THAT NIGHT
text: Mitch is gathering up some books. He looks at a chart on the wall.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Library... library...205.
text: The door to the room opens while Mitch is looking the other way. We catch a glimpse of the same tall, bulkily-built man opening Mitch's closet door and disappearing inside. Mitch turns just in time to see the door close. he goes into it, opens it and looks inside. Nothing. he goes to the door of his room. Mitch opens the door, steps into the hall and slips, landing on his ass. His books go flying.
dialog: INT. HALLWAY
text: The hall floor is covered with ice wall-to-wall. Skating MUSIC is playing on a cassette somewhere. A few students, dressed for winter, are skating. Chris skates over and helps Mitch to his feet.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Welcome to Pacific Tech's "Smart People On Ice."
text: He whirls away, leaping from wall to wall, sliding quickly down the ice. He stops in front of a short, roly-poly kid of Japanese descent, MARK ICKAGAMI, better know as ICK. Ick is a bio-chemist who spends a great deal of time in his lab experimenting with various fun compounds that do things ranging from making artificial ice to increasing memory.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (with a proletariat accent)
dialog: Ice turned out real good, Ick.
dialog: ICK
dialog: Yeah, it worked., didn't it?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: What did you use?
dialog: ICK
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Oh, sure, I tell you then you tell somebody else, and the next thing you know we're in the middle of another ice age.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (yelling down the hall)
dialog: Come on, people. Nobody's skating.
speaker_heading: A STUDENT (O.C.)
dialog: Just 'cause you're a slack, Kinsley.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Moles and trolls.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: What?
dialog: CHRIS
text: Moles and trolls. Work, work, work, work. I plan this for weeks. I go to a lot of trouble and all they want to do is study. I'm hurt. I know that's it's not like me but I'm sorry. I'm starting to get discouraged, people. We had nobody at the mutant hamster races, one entry in the Madame Curie look-alike contest, and he was disqualified later. Why do I even bother?
dialog: Chris skates off.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (to Ick)
dialog: How does he do it?
dialog: ICK
dialog: Well, I'm not an expert, but I think he puts one foot in front of the other and pushes.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Not skating. The horsing around. The never studying. I know he's smart. but nobody's that smart.
dialog: ICK
dialog: I don't know how smart he is. Before he even came here he invented a solar battery, which laid the groundwork for the system that provides the energy for Amarillo, at half the cost. He'd be a millionaire today if he been smart enough to make them pay for it. How he pulls the grades, I don't know.
text: Just then, ROARING down the hall, face down on a sled, comes JORDANS COCHRAN. She is an advanced engineering student with great theoretical and mechanical skill who can never seem to pitched energy of a hyper-kinetic kindergarten class. She crashes at Mitch's feet. He reaches down to help her.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: You okay?
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: No, not emotionally, no I'm not. I'm disappointed... not terribly, but still, it should have gone much, further, much faster. It's okay, though, I know what the problem is, that's simple, it's obviously the drag coefficient, I'll just have to re-design the blades. I can do that, that's easy. I can do that here; but I have to cut then after they're designed, that takes tools, that takes time. How long is this stuff going to last, do you know?
dialog: ICK
dialog: Maybe another half an hour.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: That's great, that's good. I can do that, no problem, lots of time.
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: What's your name?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Mitch
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: Thanks for the help. See you.
dialog: And in a flash she is gone.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Your welcome.
dialog: (to Ick)
dialog: Who was that?
dialog: ICK
dialog: That? that was...
dialog: Jordan rushes back.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: I'm Jordan, I realized I'd forgotten to tell you my name, it's Jordan. I heard there was going to be someone new this term, are you a freshman?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Yes.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: Do you have a bed?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: Oh, I was going to make you one if you needed it but you don't so that's okay. Well, I gotta go, I'll see you later, probably. See you Ick, see you Mitch.
dialog: As she races off, KENT enters carrying several binders.
dialog: KENT
dialog: What's all this suppose to be?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: This? This is new kind of shovel.
dialog: Mitch finds this very funny and reacts accordingly by laughing.
dialog: Kent can't stand to be laughed at.
dialog: KENT
dialog: (Dumping the binders into Mitch's hands)
dialog: This should keep you busy for awhile. This, plus your regular class load should turn your brains to mush in a month.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Aw! Kent, we were going to name you King of the Winter Carnival.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Ha ha.
dialog: (to Ick)
dialog: I suppose you're in on this, too. Did you make this stuff?
dialog: ICK
dialog: I'm not saying.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Who's going to clean it up?
dialog: ICK
dialog: Don't have to. It's going to go from solid form directly to gas.
dialog: KENT
dialog: (impressed by this fairly uncommon phenomenon)
dialog: Really? What is it?
dialog: ICK
dialog: I'm not saying. But I can tell you that it's fairly rare, and very unstable.
dialog: KENT
dialog: You're all a bunch of degenerates.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: We are? What about that time I caught you naked with a bowl of Jello?
dialog: KENT
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: I...you... I was hot and I was hungry. And anyway...Look, Kinsley, you're not number one anymore.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Number one what?
dialog: KENT
dialog: (pointing to Mitch)
dialog: Mighty mouse, here, beat your placement scores by over twenty points.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Really? I guess you think you're pretty hot stuff?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (uncomfortable, unsure if this is real)
dialog: Well...no, I mean
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Hey! Maybe you are smarter than me, but, can you do this?
text: Chris pushes himself off backwards and slides along the ice in an attempt at a fancy figure skating move. Just as he's about to finish he crashes to the floor at the precise moment that the floor turns into a cloud of rising gas. Chris disappears in the cloud.
dialog: ICK
dialog: (excited)
dialog: It worked!
dialog: MITCH
dialog: That's neat.
dialog: ICK
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Now if we can just keep it from exploding.
dialog: Kent runs away.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (from inside the growing cloud)
dialog: Hey, Ick. Is it okay to breathe this stuff?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ick?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ick?
dialog: The cloud fills the screen.
dialog: INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-THE NEXT MORNING
text: Perfect morning light streams through the window, making even this dump look beautiful. Chris is asleep in a strange position on his bed, proving that even asleep he is eccentric. We Pan across the room to Mitch. He has obviously fallen asleep while reading the binders that Kent had given him the night before. We HEAR the sound of the door opening, followed by some heavy footsteps. This causes Mitch to wake up. it takes him a second to realize where he is. He sits up.
speaker_heading: MITCH'S POV
text: Again we catch just a glimpse of that same mysterious figure opening the closet door. He is holding a "McDonald's" bag. He closes the door behind him.
dialog: ANGLE ON MITCH
dialog: To say the least, he's thrown by this strange intrusion.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Hello?
text: He waits a beat, listening. Nothing happens so he gets up and crosses to the closet, looks inside.
dialog: OVER MITCH'S SHOULDER INTO CLOSET
dialog: There's nothing in there but clothes. Mitch pushes the garments aside and finds just a wall.
dialog: ANGLE ON MITCH
text: He shakes his head. This is getting frustrating. He exits the room.
dialog: INT. BATHROOM
text: Mitch crosses to the urinal. Just as he is about to relieve himself, the door opens. Jordan enters. This is an experience Mitch has never before and as a result he is one uncomfortable fifteen-year-old.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: Hi, good morning, I thought I saw you come in here, you must be an earlier riser, we met last night, I'm Jordan, remember? I had a sled with me, I made you a sweater.
text: She holds out a sweater. He leans into the urinal, trying to hide himself the best he can.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Last night?
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: yeah, it's just something I do with my hands while I'm reading. I hope I got the size right, I'm pretty sure I did, I have a brother so I use him as a sizing comparison, and I have a pretty good eye for that sort of thing, so I just went ahead and made you one because I was, you know, up. Peeing?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: JORDAN
text: I never sleep. I don't know why. It drove my roommate nuts. I mean really nuts, they had to take her away in an ambulance and everything, she's okay now thought but she had to be transfer to an easier school but I don't know if that part has anything to do with being my fault, but still, anyway, if you ever want any help studying at night or just let me know, okay, 'cause I'm just a couple of doors down from you guys and I'm usually up and I wouldn't mind, okay?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Thanks, I will.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: Are you finished yet?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I can't start.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: Because I'm here?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I think so.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: Isn't that weird? Well, I have to go.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Me, too.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: Right, well, don't forget what I said, I'll put the sweater in your room, see you later, tell Chris that if he wants one I'll be happy to make him one but nit today because after classes I'm going to rebuild the back part of my room, you should come down and see it later, I have to go, bye.
dialog: She exits.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: bye.
scene_heading: INT. THE LOBBY AREA OF THE DORM- A LITTLE LATER
text: Mitch is coming down a hallway into the area. He is dressed in his tie and jacket and has books under his arm. As he crosses past the self-serve vending machine he spots Chris entering the kitchen. Mitch follows him inside.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Something strange happened to me this morning.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Was it a dream where you see yourself dressed up in kind of sun god robes standing on top of a pyramid with all theses nude women throwing little pickles at you?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Why am I the only person who has that dream?
text: Before Mitch can ask another question, Chris open the freezer compartment and takes out a large thermos-like container. He takes it over to the cutting board, then takes from his pocket a pair of calipers, a pair of tweezers, and a little box that looks like a dental floss kit. He opens the container which immediately starts pouring thick steam.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Liquid nitrogen?
text: Chris uses calipers to extract a length of tubing from inside the container. he puts it down on the board and, using the tweezers, pushing out a cylindrical mound of ice from inside the tube. Then, from the dental floss kit, he pulls out a length of very fine wire, which he uses to cut the ice into a number of thin "coins" and slides then into the lid of the container, which he picks up and takes out the door with him. Mitch follows.
dialog: INT. VENDING MACHINE AREA
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Coffee?
text: Using the tweezers, Chris picks up an ice coin and puts it into one of the machines. There is a high-pitched squeak. To Mitch's astonishment, the machine accepts the bogus money and a cup drops down and fills with coffee.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: So, what's happened?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Oh. There's a guy living in our closet.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: You've seen him too?
dialog: Chris puts his coins in several of the machines and retrieves from them junk food junky's treasure trove of goodies.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Who is it?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Hopsfield.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Is he... safe?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: So far.
dialog: Chris exits. Mitch stares after him.
speaker_heading: SCHOOL MONTAGE:
dialog: A quick series of shots moves us through the next two months of time, accompanied by an original song.
dialog: INT. LECTURE HALL-DAY
text: An older professor is lecturing, pointing to a complicated algebraic problem on a blackboard, Mitch is in the last row of this student-filled, multi-tiered classroom. Everyone else listens intently and makes notes while Mitch thumbs quickly through a textbook, then closes it and makes a note in a loose-leaf binder.
dialog: INT. ATOM SMASHER ROOM-DAY
text: Mitch stands with a group of other students watching an instructor explain the intricacies of nuclear fission. Mitch opens a notebook and starts writing furiously.
scene_heading: INT. ATHERTON'S PROJECT LAB-DAY
text: Mitch is using his notes and some pieces of equipment to explain something to the rest of the team. Chris is impressed. Kent shakes his head in disagreement until Atherton nods his approval, at which point Kent also agrees.
dialog: INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-NIGHT
text: it is late but Mitch is still hard at the books. Hopsfield goes by and disappears in the closet. Mitch doesn't even notice anymore. There is a knock at the door and Jordan enters. She has brought Mitch a device that she just built which holds textbooks and turns the pages automatically.
dialog: INT. LECTURE HALL-DAY
text: Mitch, dressed more informally, is in the same room with the same professor as in scene 54. This time, however, there are several empty seats. The people have been replaced by cassette tape recorders. Mitch takes notes.
scene_heading: INT. CHEMICAL ENGINEERING LAB-DAY
dialog: Mitch enters with another student to find a teddy bear waiting for him at his place.
dialog: INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-NIGHT
text: Mitch and Chris work alone. it is obviously very late. Using a variety of exotic-looking devices, they put the laser through its paces and make notes.
dialog: INT. LECTRURE HALL-DAY
text: This time, Mitch is the only student. Tape recorders sit in front of every seat. The professor drones on, apparently oblivious to what he sees in front of him.
dialog: INT. WAVE TANK ROOM-DAY
text: A very attractive instructress is demonstrating a dye trace experiment in a huge wave tank. Mitch takes notes.
dialog: INT. DINING HALL
text: Mitch and Ick are carrying trays of food, looking for a place to sit. They pass a seated Kent, who points out a place for Mitch, who looks to see a highchair at the end of the table.
dialog: EXT. LIBRARY-MORNING
text: Mitch comes down the stairs with several books under his arms. He stumbles and drops one of the books. As he struggles to recover it, it is handed to him by none other than Hopsfield. By the time Mitch realizes who it is, the mysterious figure is once again gone.
dialog: EXT. STREET-DAY
text: Mitch is crossing the street carrying a huge load of books. Suddenly a yellow Citroen pulls up behind him and honks its horn causing Mitch to drop everything. He looks at the driver and sees that it is a laughing Kent.
dialog: INT. ATHERTON'S CLASSROOM
text: Chris, Kent, Bodie and Carter are present as Atherton wraps up a day's class. People take serious notes. Chris reads a magazine. People file out and Mitch enters approaches Chris to get him to work on the laser. Chris shakes his head.
dialog: INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-LATE NIGHT
text: Mitch is working alone. He adjusts the laser and turns it on. It burns through a very thick block of wood, but Mitch is still not pleased.
dialog: INT. HALLWAY-NEXT MORNING
text: A very tired Mitch heads for the lecture hall. He comes to the door, opens it and enters to see a tape recorder lecturing to a roomful of tape recorders.
scene_heading: INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-ANOTHER NIGHT
dialog: In need of a break from studying, Mitch goes to the closet in hopes of figuring out how to open the wall.
text: He examines the walls and the floor and looks, for hidden switches or secret mechanisms, all to no avail. As he's about to give up, the closet door swings closed. When it closes, the wall opens to reveal a small elevator-like cage. Mitch steps in and the cage descends. It hits a lever and stops. But before Mitch steps in and the can get off, it begins to move sideways, triggering another pulley, and goes down again into the steam tunnels, then drags along the floor and stops. Mitch gets out. It's spooky. In the distance there is a glow of light.
text: Mitch goes forward until he can see the home of Hopsfield. It's a very utilitarian example of life on the edge, with all the comforts. At the console of an amazing, hand-built computer sits amazing Hopsfield. Mitch watches in awe from the darkness.
dialog: INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-DAY
text: There is an experiment in progress. A large laser is building up an energy load. Atherton, Kent, Bodie, Carter, and Mitch monitor various pieces of equipment. Things hum and click and there is a sense that something big is going to happen. Atherton seems pleased, while Mitch seems troubled. Suddenly, a valve blows and a stream of liquid nitrogen hisses from a hose, spewing frost over everything. Everyone jumps for switches and they shut the experiment down.
dialog: CARTER
dialog: (checking the valve)
dialog: It's nothing. It's just mechanical.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: GOOD. Don't bother changing it. I want you and Bodie to rebuild the whole unit; same output in half the size. Should hold up, right Mitch?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Sure, as long as we go with H.F.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Well, gentlemen, now what? Things are going okay so far, aren't they?
dialog: KENT
dialog: They certainly are in my area, Jerry.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (warning)
dialog: KENT
dialog: KENT
dialog: (unaware)
dialog: Yes?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Boy, when I think of all the applications for this...!
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (covering)
dialog: We've got enough theory to deal with without talking applications. You just worry about giving me that power breakthrough. how close are you?
dialog: KENT
dialog: (gloating)
dialog: Not very, from what I hear.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Aren't you and Chris working together?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Yes...but...
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Where is Mr. Kinsley?
dialog: KENT
dialog: (anxious to get Chris in trouble)
dialog: He's outside.
dialog: Kent goes to the window and shouts down.
speaker_heading: KENT (CONT'D)
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Kinsley! Dr. Atherton wants you.

text: He's sitting on a chaise lounge with a stack of encyclopedias, sipping a beer.
dialog: CHRIS

text: PULL OUT TO REVEAL that the chaise lounge has balloons tied to each corner. Chris dumps a volume from his lap and the chaise rises straight up in the air.
dialog: ANGEL ON ATHERTON AND CHRIS-FRAMED BY THE WINDOW
dialog: Chris hovers in mid-air.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: What are you doing out there?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Floating, sir. And thinking.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (fuming)
dialog: I want to see you at my house at six o'clock. Sharp.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Sounds fun. Should I bring anything?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: How about a proper attitude for a change?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I'll try and borrow one. Now, if you'll excuse me, there are millions of boys and girls everywhere waiting for me to bring them presents. Ho ho ho.
dialog: He hands Atherton a volume and floats from view.
dialog: INT. LAB
dialog: Atherton, Mitch and Kent stand at the window, watching Chris ascend.
dialog: KENT
dialog: He's really pushing it, isn't he, Jerry?
dialog: ANGLE ON MITCH
dialog: He smiles as he watches his roommate and friend float off.
scene_heading: EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE-EARLY EVENING
dialog: The restoration work is reaching completion and the house is looking pretty beautiful.
text: A small crew of workmen paint and do other finishing work. Chris is sitting on the porch, watching. He is eating a very large puffs of popcorn from a bag. We SEE Atherton returning from his daily jog. He is decked out in an expensive designer jogging suit and has all the appropriate accessories. he also has all the silly habits of the trendy runner for cooling down and stretching.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: You wanted to see me, your joggingness?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Mr. Kinsley. Right on time. What a surprise. Do you run?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Only when chased.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: What are you eating?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: It's one of mark's Ickagami's experiments. He's been irradiating corn with strontium. it's his hobby; big food.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: That's popcorn?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: It's big popcorn.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (over reacting)
dialog: Get it away from me. I can't stand it. I hate popcorn. Leave it there.
dialog: Chris puts the bag down on the porch.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Okay. Have you ever considered switching to de-caffeinated coffee?
text: Atherton leads Chris to the front door, where he removes his shoes and then stands and waits until Chris does the same. They proceed into the house.
scene_heading: INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE- CONTINUOUS
text: The interior is immaculate. A classic example of elegant good taste. Atherton is fastidiously protective of his things.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: I want to start seeing a lot more of you in the lab.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: You want me to work nude?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Very funny, you're a major disappointment to me, Chris.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: And you to me, Jerry.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (angry)
dialog: We had a deal!
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: And I advanced your project more than any three guys on campus.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: That was yesterday. What have you done for me today?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Hey, aren't you getting a little obsessive about this? I took in the new kid. He's working his guts out for you.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Your arrogant, disrespectful behavior is distracting him. If you keep it up, you're going to pay for it.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Hey, I'm out of here. Delenda Est Cartheo. P.E.I. July one.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: You still have to pass, dear boy, and considering the fact that my class is a requisite, it would seem that I would have some control over your destiny. From now on, you and Mr. Simon are going to spend every waking moment working on my power problem and you will solve it by my deadline.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Okay, Jerry, but I really think you should see an analyst.
dialog: Chris exits. Atherton watches him go.
dialog: INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-NIGHT
text: Mitch is alone and trying to work on the new, smaller laser. He looks tired and upset. He tinkers around for a while, then goes back to his table and looks at his notes. Nothing seems to make sense anymore. Chris enters with a beaker in his hand.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Hi. Do me a favor, taste this.
dialog: Mitch is confused.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, you won't hurt my feelings.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I...
dialog: Chris rams the spoon in his mouth.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Well, too sweet?
dialog: Mitch makes a face.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: What is it?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Beats me. I just found it in one of the labs.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Aggghh!!
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Come on. I'm just pulling your leg. How are you doing?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I'm stuck. Dr. Atherton says we've got to miniaturize the power supply and you're not helping.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Lighten up. It's only a laser.
dialog: Chris goes to the laser. Mitch is annoyed.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Instead of trying to take that roomful of capacitors over there and putting new perspective. Charge this baby up. Everything you've got.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: What for?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: You'll see. Go
text: Mitch goes next door. Chris, meanwhile, measures a certain distant from the floor and mounts a mirror on the wall above his head. He then moves to the laser and repositions it to shoot at the mirror. Mitch returns and makes some adjustments to a control panel.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: All set, I think.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Do it.
text: Mitch throws a switch. Immediately, a loud electrical hum fills the air. Chris goes over and opens the door to the hall and glances left.
speaker_heading: CHRIS'S POV
dialog: A roomful of capacitors loading.
dialog: EXT. THE CAMPUS-NIGHT
dialog: The lights twinkle from various buildings. WE HEAR the hum

dialog: What are you doing now?
speaker_heading: CHRIS (V.O.)
dialog: Making hamburgers.
text: Suddenly, there are several loud snaps and all the lights on campus go off at once as the power overload blows the sub station fuses.
dialog: MITCH (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, no!
dialog: INT. THE LAB IN DARKNESS
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Relax, it's just the fuses at the sub station. They'll have it back on in a second. More importantly, did we get a charge?
text: Suddenly there is a loud "crack" and the laser sends out a beam across the room, bouncing off the mirror on the wall., out the door, where it hits another mirror and disappears from sight.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Wow!
dialog: EXT. THE CAMPUS-CONTINUOUS
text: The beam has formed a web of light across the darkened campus. The effect is quite spectacular. People look in awe. Chris and Mitch exit the physics building.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Follow the yellow brick road.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Have you ever considered the fact that you are completely wasting your life?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Constantly.
dialog: The lights on campus come back on as Chris and Mitch continue to follow the beam.
dialog: INT. WAVE TANK BUILDING
text: An open window above the door lets the beam of light enter. Chris and Mitch enter.
dialog: INT. HALLWAY-CONTINUOUS
dialog: Chris and Mitch walk down a stairway through an open door, following the beam.
dialog: INT. WAVE TANK ROOM-CONTINUOUS
text: The place has been turned into an indoor Waikiki. The beam has been directed into a hood-shaped device that has split it into enough rays to cook a bunch of hot dogs and hamburgers on an improvised barbeque, managed by ICK, who is dressed for the beach and wearing a welding mask.
text: Past him we can see that there about twenty girls and some guys present. Several of them are water-skiing on the mechanically produced waves inside the tank, towed by an elaborated pulleys system. Others are frolicking on the "beach" and cut out palms stand around, achieving the desired effect. Blankets have been laid out and girls sit on them eating hot dogs and talking. There are sun lamps set up in one area and some kids are smoothing sun tan oil and shagging a few rays. Rock music fills the room.
dialog: ICK
dialog: (lifts his mask)
dialog: Aloha.
dialog: ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY
dialog: A lot of the guys we've seen around the dorm have started to arrive. They enter hesitantly at Chris's urging.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Come on in, boys. Surf's up.
dialog: Awestruck, shy but excited, they approach.
dialog: CORNELL
dialog: (a nerdy student)
dialog: I have a geochemistry test tomorrow and I do not feel adequately prepared.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: But the main thing is you look good.
dialog: CORNELL
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: MILTON
dialog: What if we end up having too much fun and end up failing?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: And would that be the end of the world. Milton?
dialog: MILTON
dialog: Yes, it would.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, you're right. Maybe you should go back to the library.
dialog: MILTON
dialog: Well, maybe I could just look for a minute.
dialog: CORNELL
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Are those girls?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I haven't had them all tested yet, Cornell, but so far so good.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Who are they?
dialog: MILTON
dialog: They're not from here. I'd know.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: No, no they're not, they're from a nearby college though.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Which one?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: The Wanda Trossler School of beauty.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: They're beauticians?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: CORNELL
dialog: Gee, I don't know...
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: They'll teach you. Let's get serious here, lads. There are 670 guys at pacific tech and 136 girls.
dialog: MILTON
dialog: A ratio of 4.93 to 1
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Good, Milton. Of the 136 girls, most of them can find guys a lot better than you.
dialog: CORNELL
dialog: Oh, easily.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: These girls are not used to geniuses. You might impress them.
dialog: CORNELL
dialog: I don't see how.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Let me put this another way. Given the type of people you are and the environment you're in, you guys have to admit the strong probability that this may be the only chance you'll ever get in your entire lives to have sex.
dialog: There is a pause while everyone considers the hypothesis.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Think about it.
text: He turns and heads into the party. After a beat, everyone except Mitch follows Chris's lead.
dialog: ANGLES ON VARIOUS ACTIVITIES- A LITTLE LATER
text: Water-skiing, dancing, a volleyball game. Most of the guys are making an effort to socialize. Mitch watches quietly.

dialog: So, what do you guys do? Just be smart all the time?
dialog: MILTON
dialog: Well...

dialog: MILTON
dialog: Astrophysics.
dialog: VIVIAN
dialog: Is that like sports medicine?
dialog: MILTON
dialog: Space.
dialog: VIVIAN
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Oh! Let me ask you something about that. If I was on the moon, Could I like tease hair much higher?
dialog: MILTON
dialog: Theoretically.
dialog: VIVIAN
dialog: This is fascinating.
dialog: ANGLE ON another guy named Fenton and a girl. They're necking.
dialog: CONNIE
dialog: My friend Evelyn, tells me that brilliant men are the best lovers.
dialog: FENTON
dialog: I'd say that's true.
dialog: CONNIE
dialog: Up to now, what's been your ultimate sexual experience?
dialog: FENTON
dialog: I once fell off a ladder and landed on my sister, Bernice.
text: ANGLE ON CONNELL, and a girl in the tank. they both bob up out of the water. Cornell still has his glasses on. He takes them off and can't see.
dialog: LOUISA
dialog: Why do you wear those glasses?
dialog: CORNELL

dialog: LOUISA
dialog: But you look very sexy without them.

dialog: ANGLE ON MILTON AND VIVIAN. He rubbing suntan oil on her back
dialog: MILTON
dialog: I really should be studying.
dialog: VIVIAN
dialog: Me too. I have a bleaching final tomorrow.
dialog: MILTON

dialog: Achew.
dialog: VIVIAN
dialog: Bless you.
dialog: MILTON
dialog: I'm allergic to suntan oil.
dialog: VIVIAN
dialog: Maybe you should stop.
dialog: MILTON
dialog: (aroused)
dialog: I don't think I can
dialog: ANGLE ON CORNELL AND LOUISA. They are sitting on the "beach" toweling off.
dialog: LOUISA
dialog: (very sexy)
dialog: You know, I read in the Enquirer that woman paid twenty thousand dollars for the sperm of a genius.
dialog: CORNELL
dialog: Really?
dialog: LOUISA
dialog: (putting her arms around him)
dialog: I've GOT TWENTY BUCKS?
dialog: CORNELL
dialog: Do you have a cup?
dialog: ANGLE ON MITCH
text: The party is in full swing and most of the guys have become very comfortable. Some are making out. Mitch now seems like the only one left out. he sees a pretty GIRL just coming out of the water. She adjusts her top. Mitch wanders over to her.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (with great effort)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: TAMMY
dialog: Hi.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I was watching you...swim.
dialog: TAMMY
dialog: Yes?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I was thinking of maybe going for a swim myself.
dialog: TAMMY
dialog: Yeah? Is this the kiddy pool?
text: She exits, leaving Mitch devastated. He goes and sits in a corner. Meanwhile, Chris is looking around proudly. It's obvious he didn't see what just happen to Mitch. He smiles at the fun everyone is having. A girl passes him eating a hamburger.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Don't eat that!
dialog: KIMBERLY
dialog: Huh?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Don't you know eating that stuff can give you very large breasts?
dialog: (mock despair)
dialog: Oh. My god! I see I'm too late.
text: She laughs. He puts his arms around her and they walk off. As Chris and Kimberly EXIT, we catch a glimpse of a face in a window. We push in to see Kent, spying.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM-SAME TIME (BUT APPEARS TO BE DAY)
text: OPEN TIGHT on Atherton's face. He looks odd, as there are Kleenex tissues sticking out from his shirt collar. A hand comes into frame, holding a pancake makeup puff, and starts applying it to his face.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Christ, Don. I'm doing the best I can. You act like I don't want my own invention to work. There are only so many hours in a day.

dialog: Off-hand, I'd say television.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (angrily to make up man)
dialog: Just get rid of the crows' feet!

dialog: The STAGE MANAGER approaches.
dialog: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: Ready to go, Dr. Atherton.
dialog: He exits.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Pushing me doesn't help. You tell them that.

speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: You were supposed to be in the lab tonight.
dialog: KENT
dialog: (chiming in)
dialog: Weren't you!
dialog: MITCH

dialog: KENT
dialog: That's right!
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I was working, I...
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Where's Kinsley. I imagine this was his idea.

dialog: Kent!
dialog: KENT

speaker_heading: ATHERTON

dialog: He loves it.
dialog: ANGLE ON MITCH
dialog: He runs out of the dinning room. Kent loves Mitch reaction. It makes him laugh harder.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CHRIS
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Too low.
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S ROOM-A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Mitch is trying to pack, but it's difficult because the place is in such disarray. Chris enters. He watches and tries to think of what to say.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Okay, if you want to leave, go ahead. But you'll miss the fun.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (sour)
dialog: What fun?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Ick invented a new virus and we're gonna release it in Kent's room.
dialog: Mitch turns on Chris with surprising hostility.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: That's sick! That's a sick thing to do!
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Hey, I was just kidding, I...
dialog: MITCH
dialog: You're always just kidding. There's something wrong with you.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Just a second...
dialog: MITCH
dialog: The other night I needed your help and all you wanted to do was party.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I tried to help you. I tried to help you relax.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Being snubbed by beauticians isn't my idea of relaxing.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Student beauticians.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (Blows up)
dialog: I thought this place was going to be different, but it's just the same. I'm either used or made fun of. In high school they pushed me in a mailbox, did I tell you that?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: They called me Chris the whiss'...
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Really? What's a whiss?
dialog: CHRIS
text: I think they meant wuss, but it didn't rhyme...when I was three years old, I balanced my father's checkbook so they sent me to school and fired their accountant. My father was so intimidated, he stopped speaking to me. My teacher disliked me because I was smarter than they were, and my classmates hated me because I bell the bell curve. Sound familiar? And tell me why my...why did my mother dress me in white shirts, hush puppies and a briefcase, guaranteeing that a girl would never talk to me?
dialog: Mitch looks down at his own white shirt and hush puppies.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: YOU?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (Dramatic)
dialog: And then one night, in this room, I was sitting right where you are sitting now. I had a vision. I saw him.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: god
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Hopsfield.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Hopsfield? Oh! The guy in the closet.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah. Laslo Hopsfield. I followed him. Through the closet; down into the steam tunnels. And down there I saw the most disgusting thing Ive ever seen.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (Frighten)
dialog: What?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Hopsfield in his pajamas.
dialog: MITCH LAUGHS.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (Lighter, but sincere)
dialog: And I talk to the guy . Turned out that in the Seventies he was the number one stud around here. Smarter than you and me put together. So brilliant, so sharp, so advanced, so long.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: He graduated. Went to work for some chemical company. One day someone told him he was making stuff that was killing people. I think it was his mother. He freaked. You see, he was totally unprepared for the real world. He had no philosophy. He thought science was the answer for everything.
dialog: Mitch
dialog: Am I gonna wind up in a steam tunnel?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Yes, you are, Metaphorically speaking. Unless you see that the same thing that has made your life miserable can make it great; your brain. When you're smart, people need you, and you can learn how to work that for fun and profit.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: You had a arrangement going with Atherton, don't you? That's why you don't have to study.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Hey, I don't carry a briefcase.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You're a nice kid. If you leave I'll miss you.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (thinking about it)
dialog: If I stay, what should I do, I mean...
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Well, the first thing you have to do is get even with Kent. It's a moral imperative.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: EXT. CAMPUS-NIGHT
text: Kent's Citroen pulls up. Kent and Carter get out and walk by Jordan, who is sitting nearby.
dialog: KENT
dialog: And at Northern Electronics you get the stock options, but not the free housing, It's what makes PEI so sweet. You get everything.
dialog: CARTER
dialog: Yeah, and Kinsley's got that locked.
dialog: KENT

dialog: Maybe he does, and maybe he doesn't.
dialog: They walk away.
text: After a beat, CHRIS, MITCH and ICK jump out from behind another car. Mitch carries a TOOL BOX.

dialog: I had help.
dialog: KENT

dialog: You?

dialog: I'm going to get you guys. Dr. Atherton's gonna hear about this.

dialog: DECKER
dialog: Good.

dialog: Anything I should know about?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Shut up Kinsley. I'll be with you in a moment.
dialog: DECKER
dialog: Goodbye, Jerry, and good luck. Susan?
dialog: They begin to exit. Chris takes Susan's hand.

dialog: I guess this is goodbye. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to know you. At all.
dialog: (to the boys in admiration)
dialog: Have you ever seen breasts like theses before?

dialog: MITCH
dialog: Something wrong?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: No. Atherton is going to flunk me out of school.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: But you had a deal.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, and he says I didn't deliver. You sleep with pits, you wake up smelly. I think Aristotle said that. It was him or Eva Gabor. At least Hopsfield still has his integrity.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I thought I was so smart. I didn't want to be like the other dumb geniuses like Hopsfield. I though I could use Them., instead of Them using me. But, Guess what?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I have to agree. It does appear that you've been the victim of your own erroneous logic.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: However, this doesn't mean that you can't get yourself out.

dialog: How?

dialog: Hi, Laslo.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: I thought you might want some help so I dug into the computer and got every question Artherton's ever asked on every final he ever given.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Gee, I didn't get you anything. Is that them?
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: No, these are entries for McDonald's Sweepstakes. No purchase necessary. Enter as often as you want. So, I am.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Really?
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: This box makes it one million, six hundred thousand. I should win thirty two point six percent of the prizes, including the car.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it?
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: I suppose so. But they set up the rules, and lately, I have come to realize that I have certain materialistic needs.

dialog: JORDAN
dialog: You made it with her?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No. That's what was unbelievable.

dialog: INT. ANTHERTON'S LAB-DAY
text: Chris enters and prepares to test the new equipment. He aligns the secondary laser and let it charge up. He makes some final checks and then throws a switch. The laser fires for an instant but then seems to go crazy. The new laser overheats and the main chamber sparks and smokes. Chris tries to shut it down but to now avail. he tears the cover off in hopes of pulling the wiring, but he's too late. We see everything melting away as the machine eats itself. We also see a message left for Chris just before it too melts. It reads: "1 laser=1car." Chris is on the verge of a complete mental collapse as he watches his work go up in smoke.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (in anguish)
dialog: No!!!!
text: There is nothing but the echo of his voice in response. The main laser stands like a huge, frozen bird in the empty room. In anger and frustration he swears at the machine.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You bastard. This is your fault.
text: He kicks the wastepaper basket in hopes of getting rid of some of this anger; but, instead, all he gets is the basket bouncing back and hitting him in the shin.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit! I deserve that. It all comes back on you in the end.
dialog: He suddenly stands up straight as though he were having a stroke.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Laslo! Buddy! Have you seen Mitch?
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: No. How did you do?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (elated)
dialog: I failed!
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: You shouldn't have.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: That's true. But never mind that now. It came to me. The power problem. I solved it. Echoes! It's so simple, four little mirrors. It bounces back and supercharges the gas itself. I've got to find Mitch to help me build it but it should increase the power ten-fold at least. If you see him, tell him to meet me at the lab. Bye.
dialog: Chris exits, leaving Hopsfield lost in thought.
dialog: EXT. STUDENT UNION-MOMENTS LATER
text: A hand-painted sign hangs over the door that says: "Exam Week Decompression Here." Chris runs in the door.
scene_heading: INT. DECOMPRESSION ROOM-CONTINUOUS
text: The room is full of students who are blowing off steam from studying for and taking exams. They are engaged in all sorts of silly, mindless activities, ranging from tiddly-winks and video games to watching cartoons. There are supplies of "brain food" and health drinks around. Mitch, Ick and Jordan are in the corner. Chris runs up to them.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: Oh, Chris. How did it go?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Great. It was a snap. But Atherton said he's failing me anyway.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: That's terrible. You must be feeling awful. Are you all right?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Thank you, Jordan. I do feel terrible but I can't talk about it right now. I need Mitch. Gotta go. Bye.
dialog: He grabs Mitch and pulls him out.
dialog: ICK
dialog: He seems to be handling it all right.

scene_heading: INT. ATHERTON'S LAB-LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Atherton, Kent, Bodie and Carter stand by the laser as Chris explains what he's done with formulas on the blackboard.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: As you know, I was working on supercharging the DF by means of a fusion technique using a secondary laser. Well, when I tried it, I discovered Kent had sabotaged it so it collapsed on itself.
dialog: Everyone looks at Kent in disgust.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: And I want to thank him for the thought.
dialog: KENT
dialog: What????
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: The Deuterium and Fluorine take up enough space by themselves, right? Well, the mistake we've been making up to now is in trying to kick up the power by means of yet another outside source. Big and bulky, right? Well, the elegance of this is that by reflecting part of the lasing light back in the gas jets we supercharge the whole deal, increasing the power tenfold with no increase in size.
dialog: KENT
dialog: This is a complete waste of time.
dialog: Mitch has been preparing the laser for demonstration. He is struggling to lift several thick metal plates.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Kent, make yourself useful for once and help put those plates against the wall.
dialog: Kent does and everyone stands back.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, Mitch do it. This should work.
text: Mitch switches on the main laser. It comes to life. Gases flow and a beam appears, hitting the plate without effect.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Now we open the vacuum chamber.
dialog: He turns a valve and the beam begins to heat up the plate.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: So far so good. And now, cross your fingers.
text: He throws a switch. There's a beat. And then, suddenly, the beam glows intensely brighter, cuts through the plate, the cabinets behind it and through the wall out into the night. Chris and Mitch jump shut the whole thing off.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Sorry about the wall, sir.
dialog: KENT
dialog: (looking through the hole)
dialog: And the tree across the quad.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (in awe)
dialog: Screw the wall, you did it! You really did it.
dialog: KENT
dialog: (petulant)
dialog: I've done my part, too.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: (ignoring Kent)
dialog: Okay, Kinsley. You did it. You pass.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: And I think we can get that job back for you at PEI.
dialog: KENT
dialog: (apoplectic)
dialog: What! You can't. That's my job. I've done everything you've ever asked. I get your laundry, and I finished the mirror. Look.
text: Kent runs out of the room as Mitch and Chris exchange a look and Atherton shakes his head. Kent returns, rolling a circular precision mirror one meter in diameter.
dialog: KENT
dialog: See! Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a film virtually 100 per cent reflective, one micron thick and apply it to a mirror this shape?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Good, Kent.
dialog: (to Chris, in a hurry)
dialog: I have to go. I have a pressing...
dialog: He exits.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (very happy for Chris)
dialog: Let's celebrate.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Absolutely. Kent, you with us?
dialog: KENT
dialog: (totally frustrated)
dialog: Oh...eat me.
dialog: EXT. CAMPUS-NIGHT
dialog: Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan are looking at the laser hole in the tree.
dialog: EXT. LIBRARY-NIGHT
dialog: They look at where the beam has cut a hole through the head of the statue of Dr. Bradford.
dialog: EXT. STREET-NIGHT
text: They look high up at a hole where the beam went through a telephone pole and then across the street, even higher, where it burned through a billboard on top of tavern. They cheer.
dialog: INT. BAR-LATER
text: Our group is celebrating. The jukebox blares. Chris and Ick are drinking beers; Mitch and Jordan are holding hands, sharing a milkshake and feeding each other French fries.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I don't think I'm ready for that yet. Maybe we should wait a year; at least until I get my license.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: I understand. There are a lot of things to be considered here. For example, I could drive.
text: Hopsfield enters and sits down at the table. Everyone stares for a beat.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: (to Chris)
dialog: I've been thinking about your laser solution.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I figure you've increased the output to six megawatts.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: What would you use that for?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: The applications are unlimited. Industrial for one.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: With the gas tanks you've designed the beam would only last for forty seconds. What good is that?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I don't care, Laslo. I graduated.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Let the engineers figure out a use for it. That's not our concern.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: Maybe somebody already has a use for it, one for which it's perfectly designed.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: You mean Atherton had something in mind all along?
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: Looks at the facts: very high power, portable, limited firing time, unlimited range. All you'd need is a big spinning mirror and you could vaporize a human target from space.
dialog: Hopsfield gets up and walks outside. Silence for a beat.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: This is not good.
dialog: ICK
dialog: You want another beer?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: How big a mirror?
dialog: INT. HALLWAY-EARLY MORNING
dialog: Chris, Mitch, Ick, Jordan and Hopsfield run down the hall and enter the lab.
dialog: ANGLE- THE LAB
dialog: The laser is gone.
dialog: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: Chris runs next door and forces Kent's lab door open, looks in.
dialog: INT. KENT'S LAB
dialog: They all enter.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: The mirror is gone, too. Atherton, you worm! You pig! You fuck! Kent, you too!
text: Chris is venting his rage on every inanimate object in the room, kicking and punching.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I should have seen it! How could I have not seen it!
dialog: MITCH
dialog: He lied to us.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: It's easy to lie to you. You trust people! I'm cynic! What an asshole I am!
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: I understand how you feel, Chris, and you're right. But what we should be doing now is trying to find out what he's doing.
dialog: INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-NIGHT
dialog: Chris and Mitch sit waiting. Chris is very despondent. Very. Jordan enters.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Did you do it?
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: I put a receiver in it too.
dialog: (referring to Chris)
dialog: Is he okay?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I don't know he stopped talking about an hour ago. May I see it?
text: She holds out her hand and we see an almost microscopic electronic device. Ick enters carrying several gas masks, a gas bottle, some tubing an atomizer.
dialog: ICK
dialog: Ready?
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY -MOMENTS LATER
text: Mitch, Jordan and Ick are gathered around the closed door to Kent's room wearing the gas masks. Ick feeds the end of the tube under the door and opens the valve on the bottle.

dialog: A STUDENT walks by, not batting an eye.
dialog: STUDENT
dialog: Hi, guys.
dialog: INT. KENT'S ROOM
text: The gas has knocked Kent out. He sleeps peacefully in a chair. The door opens and our gang enters.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Open his mouth.
text: He does and she pulls out some dental tools and goes to work, placing the receiver in Kent's mouth.
dialog: JORDAN (cont'd)
dialog: It was his braces that gave me the idea. They're a perfect antenna. His whole..
dialog: ICK
dialog: It's about time someone put it to good use.
scene_heading: INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

dialog: INT. KENT'S ROOM-SAME TIME
text: Kent begins to stir. We can HEAR Mitch's voice coming from Kent's head. At first he thinks he's dreaming.

dialog: I'm talking to you, Kent.
dialog: KENT
dialog: What?
dialog: MITCH (V.O.)
dialog: I said I'm talking to you.

dialog: MITCH (V.O.)
dialog: This is Jesus, Kent, and you've been a very naughty boy.
dialog: KENT
dialog: (cracking up, laughing)
dialog: All right! Who is this?! Bodie? Carter?
dialog: MITCH (V.O.)
dialog: I am known by many names. I am the One. Turn to me and be saved.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Oh, Sure.
dialog: MITCH (V.O.)
dialog: Cut the crap, Kent, you've built a weapon.
dialog: KENT
dialog: How did you know that?
dialog: MITCH (V.O.)
dialog: I know everything.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Oh. God.
dialog: INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM
dialog: MITCH
dialog: That's right, Kent. Where is the laser now?
dialog: INT. KENT'S ROOM
dialog: KENT
dialog: I can't tell you.
dialog: MITCH (V.O.)
dialog: How would you like to burn for the rest of time?
dialog: KENT
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: No, they're testing it on the twenty-seventh but I don't know where. It's classified.
dialog: MITCH (V.O.)
dialog: Oh.
dialog: KENT
dialog: What?
dialog: MITCH (V.O.)
dialog: Nothing. I want you to think about what you've done and repent, and from now on, stop playing with yourself.
dialog: KENT
dialog: I don't...okay
dialog: INT. CHRIS AND MITCH'S ROOM
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Now what?
dialog: The closets door opens and Hopsfield appears.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: Phase two.
dialog: INT. STEAM TUNNELS
text: They are near Hopsfield's lair. Hopsfield has removed the cover from an enormous terminal. Chris seems remote and depressed.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: This is the phone terminal for the entire school.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Okay, we tap Atherton's office phone. What about his home?
dialog: ICK
dialog: All the faculty's home phone are part of the University system.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: (enthusiastically, looking at the maze of wiring)
dialog: Great, all we have to do is find it!
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: We'll find it.
dialog: Jordan and Hopsfield set to work searching for Atherton's lines. Ick is concerned about Chris.
dialog: ICK
dialog: I'm depressed. Why did I listen to my parents? I should have become a ping-pong pro.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: It's not too late.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: You shouldn't be depressed. It's us he used.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: Downtown Schmidlap.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: (Still working)
dialog: Ernie "Downtown" Schmidlap. From my high school. He was captain of everything. One day he told me he wanted to "date me up." so for a month he'd come over and I'd do his homework for him. He was going to take me to the prom. But once he passed his courses, he took Roberta Preen. I stayed home and re-wired our housekeeper's TV.
dialog: ICK
dialog: That's awful!
dialog: MITCH
dialog: You think that hurts? You should've met my Uncle Stan. He was a Weasel.
dialog: ICK
dialog: That bad, huh?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No, that was his lodge. The Royal order of Friendly Weasels. Every Wednesday when I was eight, he'd take me down to his lodge meeting and he'd challenge people to call out two five-digit numbers. I had to multiply them in my head faster than a guy could do it on a calculator. They'd bet on me. Of course, after the meeting, he'd take me for ice cream.
dialog: ICK
dialog: That's nice.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Well...he'd take me to the supermarket and I had to dip my hand in.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: I've got his office.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: I've got his home.
dialog: INT. STEAM TUNNEL- SOMETIME LATER
dialog: They've all made themselves comfortable as they sit and wait for the phone tap to produce results. Hopsfield has wired a speaker so that they can hear,
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Why doesn't your phone ring, you jogging, syphilitic microbe?
dialog: ICK
dialog: (sotto, to Mitch)
dialog: I think he's coming around.
dialog: Suddenly, from the speaker, we HEAR the sound of Atherton's phone being picked up.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON (V.0./FILTER)
dialog: Hello
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Is this Jerome Atherton?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON (V.O.)
dialog: Yes, it is.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: This is Bill Carlisle. I saw your television show the other night about the reproductive system.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON (V.O.)
dialog: Thank you, I hope you enjoyed it.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: I love it. Everything you said was copied word for word from my book and I expect a lot of money for it.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON (V.O.)
dialog: Need I remind you, it's public television, an attempt to teach people something. And all you can think of is personal greed. It's people like you that make me feel bad about being American.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: I'm Canadian
speaker_heading: ATHERTON (V.O.)
dialog: I'm not surprised. Good day.
dialog: They hang up.
dialog: ICK
dialog: God, he's good at that. He almost gets away with it. That's the most manipulative guy I've ever seen... I mean heard.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: He does get away with it.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Not anymore.
dialog: INT. STEAM TUNNEL-LATER STILL
text: Everyone lies asleep in various places and positions, Mitch awakens. He is amazed to find Jordan asleep on his shoulder, so amazed he has to wake her.

speaker_heading: DECKER (V.O.)
dialog: Jer? Dave Decker How are you?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON (V.O.)

speaker_heading: ATHERTON (V.O.)
dialog: Very funny, Dave. What do you want? I'm busy.
speaker_heading: DECKER (V.O.)
dialog: It sounds like it. Listen, I'll be out there tomorrow for the test but I want you to go to the Marsh this afternoon and check optics systems one more time.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON (V.O.)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DECKER (V.O.)
dialog: Because I'm in charge, Doctor. Goodbye. He hangs up. All look to Chris.
dialog: ICK
dialog: Well?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (comes to life)
dialog: It's happening.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: It's only weapon if it works, right?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (determined)
dialog: You're absolutely right! The time has come, people. No more being used. No more Downtown Schmidlaps or Uncle Stans or Jerry Athertons. We're going to take responsibility for our own brains. Remember, without ethics there can be no morality. Without morality there is no society and without society there can be no fast food restaurants. So the whole country, nay, in the world, is counting on us to get even in a big way. Thank you.
dialog: ICK
dialog: Nice logic.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Thanks. Synchronize watches.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Why?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: It's just something you say at a time like this.

text: A technician hits a switch and a monitor pops on. Crosshairs dominate the center of the screen. The desert floor rushes by. Atherton turns to a specialist standing by.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Norman, if you'd be so kind. This cockpit mock-up duplicates the shuttle flight deck and we've placed it here to demonstrate the firing technique.
dialog: The specialist takes his place inside the command module.
speaker_heading: PILOT (V.O./FILTER)
dialog: We are thirty one DME from the target.
dialog: CONTROLLER
dialog: (mike)
dialog: Roger, Crossbow. Open the doors.
speaker_heading: INT. BOMB BAY
dialog: The doors open to reveal clouds rushing past and the ground far below.
dialog: EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE
dialog: MEREDITH
dialog: These are rather strong accusations, Chris.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Yes, sir, I know.
dialog: MEREDITH
dialog: If they're true, I'm going to need some proof.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I think we're going to be able to accommodate you in just a minute, sir.
dialog: Looking past Meredith, Chris sees Kent approaching.
text: ANGLE ON KENT as he arrives at the house and stars up at it. He glances at his watch and waits impatiently.
dialog: INT. COMMAND CENTER
text: Inside the firing module, the specialist pulls down the target sighting device and puts his hands on the joysticks.
speaker_heading: SPECIALIST
dialog: Power on.
dialog: CONTROLLER
dialog: T minus fifty and counting.
speaker_heading: INT. BOMB BAY
dialog: The large mirror lowers into its firing position and the laser powers up.
dialog: EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE - MORNING
dialog: The group watch Kent, who is nervously pacing back and forth, talking to himself.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Boy, if this works, he's going to start a new religion.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: If it doesn't work ...?
dialog: Chris shoots him a censoring look.
dialog: INT. COMMAND CENTER
text: This countdown continues. Monitors display the target sight, the pilot's sighting screen of the ground and a camera's view of the bomber.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Trajectory command relay, locked.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Now, Norm here has firing control.
dialog: ANGLE ON TARGETING MONITOR
dialog: The target motorcade is sighted.
speaker_heading: INT. BOMB BAY
dialog: The laser mirror and sighting lens move in unison as they line up on target.
dialog: INT. COMMAND CENTER
dialog: The crosshairs line up on the sighting monitor.
dialog: EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: What's he doing?
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
dialog: Kent has now started toward the front door.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I told him not to go in!
dialog: CLOSER ANGLE ON KENT
dialog: KENT
dialog: (muttering to Jesus)
dialog: Look, this is Jerry's house, we're very close, so if you're not going to answer me, then I'm going in ...
dialog: He reaches for the front door.
speaker_heading: KENT (CONT'D)
dialog: ... here I come.
dialog: ANGLE ON CHRIS AND MITCH
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Kent! Stop!
dialog: ANGLE ON KENT
dialog: who turns and sees them.
dialog: INT. COMMAND CENTER
dialog: Everyone is riveted to the sighting monitor.
speaker_heading: SPECIALIST
dialog: Target locked. In ten, nine, eight ...
dialog: As the countdown continues.
speaker_heading: INT. BOMB BAY
text: The computer comes to life and electronically unlocks the laser optics from the sighting camera. The mirror turns to the left.
dialog: INT. COMMAND CENTER
dialog: The aerial view of the motorcade remains centered on the sighting monitor.
dialog: INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE
dialog: Kent opens the front door and enters.
dialog: KENT
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: That looked like Dr. Meredith in a bathrobe. First I'm hearing things, now I'm seeing things.
dialog: He closes the door.
speaker_heading: KENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, God. Let me have it.
text: The room is dark, lit only by morning light coming through a large stained glass window at the top of the stairs. In the middle of the room is what looks like a large above-ground swimming pool, covered in aluminum foil. Kent is amazed.
dialog: INT. COMMAND CENTER
speaker_heading: SPECIALIST
dialog: ... three, two, one, bingo.
dialog: He hits the trigger.
speaker_heading: INT. BOMB BAY
dialog: The laser fires.
dialog: EXT. SKY
dialog: The laser beam traces through the atmosphere.
dialog: INT. COMMAND CENTER
dialog: The group waits expectantly. Nothing happens to the target.
dialog: EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE
text: Chris and Mitch, who are running toward the house, are stopped in their tracks by the incredible sight of the red laser beam shooting down out of the heavens, striking the grass, tracking across the lawn then up the wall of Atherton's house.
dialog: INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE
dialog: The beam strikes the window and for one tiny moment causes the most incredible light show anyone has ever seen.
dialog: KENT
dialog: (in awe)
dialog: Oh!
text: The window is obliterated by the laser light, which crashes down directly onto the aluminum foil-covered pool.
speaker_heading: KENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, my!
text: The foil is heated instantly in the laser light and there is the SOUND of tiny explosions, building to a roar. In a second, the foil rises violently and tears open. Kent picks up a piece of debris and examines it.
dialog: KENT
dialog: Popcorn?
dialog: In the next instant, he is engulfed in popcorn.
dialog: EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE
text: The beam disappears as suddenly as it came. Everyone stands in awe. A few kernels fly out of the broken window, then a storm.
dialog: INT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE
text: Kent and furniture are being forced up the stairs by a rising tide of popping popcorn. He struggles against it, loses, and sinks into the mound like a dinosaur in quicksand.
dialog: EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE
text: The windows are filling up with popcorn. Finally, they crack and break as popcorn forces its way out of the house wherever it can.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Kent!
text: Chris and Mitch head for the front door. Suddenly, it bursts open and Kent is carried out by a moving wall of popcorn.
dialog: INT. COMMAND CENTER
dialog: People furiously check systems.
speaker_heading: CARMICHAEL
dialog: I don't understand. Did it fire?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Yes, we indicate a shot. We've got another problem, though. It's not shutting down.
speaker_heading: INT. BOMB BAY
text: The computer is still working. The laser optics and equipment begin to melt. It's been wired to self-destruct.
dialog: INT. COMMAND CENTER
dialog: The devastated group watches the laser self destruct on the monitor.
dialog: DECKER
dialog: Nice going, Jer.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Something's wrong here. Unlock the bird's eye.
dialog: He takes over the command module sighting system
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: I'm tracing where the shot went.
text: We watch as the monitor's view swings away and across a residential neighborhood, coming to rest on a bird's eye view of his own house.
speaker_heading: ATHERTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, no.
dialog: The monitor view moves in to reveal what looks like a growing mushroom.
dialog: DECKER
dialog: What have you done?
speaker_heading: ATHERTON
dialog: Retired.
dialog: EXT. ATHERTON'S HOUSE
text: The group looks on as the mountain of popcorn continues to engulf the house. Meredith goes to see if Kent is all right.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Do you think we used too much?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Maybe a little.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Well, I guess we all learned something here today.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: What?
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: I don't know, but it seemed like the right thing to say, didn't it?
dialog: ICK
dialog: It did to me.
text: As they continue to watch the destruction of the house, and various neighbors come out to see what's what, a Winnebago pulls up and stops. Hopsfield gets out.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: I think you used too much.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Really? I'm sorry you missed it.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: Yeah, well, I had to pack.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Why?
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: I'm getting married.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: What? To whom?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: (looking at the U-Haul)
dialog: What is all this?
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: Oh, I won. Only thirty-one point eight percent though. I have to figure that out. But not this summer.
dialog: Mitch suddenly sees Sherry standing at the Winnebago door.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Sherry?
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: (kissing Hopsfield)
dialog: Hi. Isn't it wonderful. I finally found him. Number One. I've been looking for him for ten years.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: What can I do? She loves me.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Right. Congratulations.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: Thanks. Anyway, we probably won't ever get to see you again, so, bye.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: What do you mean? Where are you going?
dialog: SHERRY
dialog: I've got a little survival place in Wyoming. We're going to live there.
dialog: HOPSFIELD
dialog: Yeah, it's getting too weird around here. See ya.
dialog: They climb into the Winnebago and it pulls away. The others watch it go.
dialog: ICK
dialog: You think it's getting too weird around here.
dialog: CHRIS
dialog: Absolutely.
dialog: JORDAN
dialog: I didn't notice.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I like it.
text: In the background, the popcorn has split the walls of the house and finally lifts the roof off like the top of a pot. The whole house tilts to its side and the popping stops.
text: As we PULL BACK, Atherton's car pulls up and he gets out, dumbstruck. Dr. Meredith walks over to him and confronts him. Kent joins Chris and the others who watch.
dialog: THE END.
