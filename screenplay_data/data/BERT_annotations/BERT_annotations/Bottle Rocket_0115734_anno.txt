speaker_heading: DIGNAN

dialog: why.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: See, that's what I'm saying. It has
text: the logic of a dream.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: The point is the killer always
dialog: goes, May I speak to Starsky? He
text: says his name.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What does Starsky say?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: He says. This is he.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN

text: Anthony's in a kid's room. Looking at posters of a football

speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Kind of. Except we've already got
text: the keys.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: That's true. But what if they
dialog: change the locks?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Would they do that?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Who knows? That's why I filed it
dialog: down.
text: Dignan nods.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Now that window can never be locked.
dialog: It's impossible.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: See, your mind is very good with
text: the more mechanical details.
dialog: Whereas my strength would be --
text: A good-looking WOMAN about forty-five years old interrupts
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Can I use your Tabasco?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Sure.
text: Anthony hands her a bottle of Tabasco off the counter. She
text: walks away. Down the counter.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You don't see many women who like
dialog: Tabasco.
text: They watch her for a minute. Dignan looks away.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: She's really kind of hot.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN

dialog: of those?

speaker_heading: DIGNAN

dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: They are.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: So who's going to know?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: My brother.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Future Man.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Futute Man. You know. Cause he
text: looks like he's from the future.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: He looks like he was designed by
dialog: scientists. For desert warfare.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That never would of --
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Let's cut the bullshit.
text: Silence. They all look at the car. Pause.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: It's got a V-8, Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What do you think the cops have?
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY
text: They're sitting at the coffee table in Bob's great big
text: living room. It's got high ceilings and two Persian rugs.
text: They're eating sandwiches and chips.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: If you're that worried, maybe we
dialog: should just steal one.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What are you talking about, Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Can you use a coaster.
text: Bob slides a coaster under Dignan's glass.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Did you ever steal a car bdfore?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah. I've stolen two cars before.
text: One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With
dialog: T-Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to
dialog: drive.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You stole a Trans-Am.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yes. I did.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: OK, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's true, Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Well. What do you want to do? You
dialog: want to steal one or just drive
dialog: your car?
speaker_heading: BOB

dialog: I'll just drive my car.
scene_heading: INT. DELI. DAY
text: Anthony's playing pinball at a machine in the back of a
text: little grocery store. Dignan's watching.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Anthony, we'll get two hundred for
dialog: the coin collection alone. That's
text: less than what it's appraised at.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: But Dignan, do you really know that
dialog: much about rare coins?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I know about money, Anthony. I know
dialog: the value of money. Plus the
dialog: earrings are worth three times that.
text: Anthony looks at Dignan. Dignan points at the pinball machine.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Your ball.
text: Dignan tries to hit the flipper.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I told you not to take the earrings.
text: Anthony keeps looking at Dignan. Dignan doesn't look up from
text: the machine. Anthony turns and walks away.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You got another ball.
text: Dignan watches him go.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I'm playing your game.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK. DAY
text: They're walking fast down the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: The list, Dignan. I know you
dialog: remember the list because you
dialog: signed it. "Things Dignan was not
dialog: supposed to touch."
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Every valuable item in the house
dialog: was on that list.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: That doesn't make any difference. I
dialog: bought those earrings for my mother
text: on her birthday. They have a very
dialog: special value for her.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Yeah, but I can't be sorting
dialog: through that shit in the middle of
dialog: a burglary. There's just not time
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Then you shouldn't of gone in
dialog: there, Dignan. Maybe we should of
dialog: robbed your house. Did you ever
dialog: think of that?
text: Dignan stops walking. Anthony looks back at him. Pause.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What?
text: Dignan turns and starts walking the other way.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: How was I ridiculing you?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You're making fun of my family. You
dialog: know there's nothing to steal from
dialog: my mom and Craig. You know exactly
dialog: what you're saying.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: That's not what I meant, Dignan.
text: They both see something. They keep walking. Dignan looks
text: back down the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Did you see that?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Yeah, I saw it.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I'm lookout.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Dignan, it's got an alarm.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I don't think so. Just reach on in.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: That sets it off.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No, just do it real quick.
dialog: (starts down the sidewalk)
dialog: I'll meet you down there.
text: Dignan cuts into an alley. Anthony turns back. Looks at a
text: parked car. Looks left and right. Walks to the car and
text: reaches in the half-open window.
text: An alarm goes off. Anthony unlocks the door and opens it.
text: Leans inside. Grabs a wallet off the seat.
text: A MAN standing on the sidewalk watches Anthony get out of
text: the car. Anthony looks at him, then walks down the sidewalk
text: not too fast. He turns down an alley and runs.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY. DAY
text: Anthony comes around the corner and meets Dignan beside a
text: dumpster. The alarm is still ringing in the distance.
text: Anthony starts looking through the wallet.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: It had an alarm.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Yeah, I heard that.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (counting the money)
dialog: Five, seven, eight dollars.
text: He looks at Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (taking the wallet)
dialog: Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Eight dollars.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That's not bad.
text: Anthony keeps looking at Dignan. Dignan smiles. He hands
text: Anthony a five dollar bill. Anthony looks at it. He takes it.
text: He puts it in his pocket. Dignan puts out his hand to shake.
text: Anthony waits a second. He shakes Dignan's hand for just a
text: second and walks down the alley. Dignan smiles and walks
text: behind him.
scene_heading: INT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHT
text: Anthony and Dignan are sitting at a table with Bob.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What do herbs have to do with it? I
dialog: don't understand the --
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Pot is an herb. It's just like any
dialog: type of gardening.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: How much could you grow?
text: Realistically.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: As much as I want. When these
dialog: plants bud I'll probably have about
dialog: six thousand dollars worth of weed.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You should take a look. I have an
dialog: entire crop in my backyard.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: In your backyard? How do you
dialog: protect them?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's private property. Plus I have
dialog: Hector.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Hector woudn't do anything.
speaker_heading: BOB
text: But he's got a loud bark. That's
dialog: the most important thing is a loud
dialog: bark.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: If it's that easy why doesn't
dialog: everybody grow them?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Good question.
text: Bob looks at Anthony and Dignan. He suddenly gets worried.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Don't you guys tell anybody about
dialog: my plants.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You're paranoid, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Could you grow cinnamon?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know. Sure, I guess.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You could make your own cinnamon
text: toast.
text: Bob looks at Anthony for a second. He looks at Dignan. Back
dialog: at Anthony.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Are you a fag?
scene_heading: LITTLE RICHARD
dialog: You're the faggot.
text: Bob turns around to see LITTLE RICHARD, short but muscular,
text: wearing a down vest and a baseball cap.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Little Richard. I don't believe it.
dialog: They'll let anybody in this place.
dialog: Sit down.
text: Little Richard sits down.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dignan and Anthony, this is Little
text: Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
scene_heading: LITTLE RICHARD
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I don't know about that.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Little Richard. Trust me. You're
dialog: insane. Jesus, this guy used to
text: carry a percussion bomb around in
dialog: his trunk. You do not want a guy
text: like that loose on the streets.
scene_heading: LITTLE RICHARD
dialog: It seemed like a good idea at the
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The one and only Little Richard.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Are you named after THE Little
dialog: Richard?
scene_heading: LITTLE RICHARD
text: (stares at Dignan)
dialog: Ha! Ha! Ha! Why don't you stick it
dialog: up your ass. Great group of guys
dialog: you're hanging out with.
text: Little Richard goes out the door.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What was that all about?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I can't believe you said that.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What did I say?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I told you he's crazy.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: But he didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Hang on a second.
text: Dignan gets up and walks out of the restaurant. Anthony and
text: Bob look at each other. They start to get up.
scene_heading: EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHT
text: Anthony and Bob go out the door. Dignan is walking over to a
text: station wagon. Little Richard is getting in.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Little Richard. Wait a second. Hang
dialog: on. I didn't mean to --
text: Little Richard opens his door hard into Dignan's legs, then
text: gets out fast and takes off his shirt. Dignan tries to hit
text: him but doesn't connect. They grab onto each other and start
text: knocking around. Another GUY gets out of the station wagon.
text: Two more GUYS rush out the door of the burger place. Anthony
text: and Bob stand back, nervous.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Let them fight.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Let them fight.
text: They all watch. Dignan keeps trying to punch Little Richard,
text: but he's hanging onto him too tight. They keep spinning
text: around together, moving down the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Anthony.
text: Anthony looks at the other guys then moves toward Dignan.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: OK. Break it up. Break it up.
text: Little Richard lets go of Dignan. They separate.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I separated my shoulder.
text: Dignan is holding onto his arm. He kind of moans.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: OK. Hang on.
text: Anthony grabs hold of Dignan's arm. Everybody's watching.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Just pull straight up.
text: .Anthony pulls up hard on Dignan's arm. Dignan tries not to
text: yell, then suddenly he's OK and relieved.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Is it back in?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (moving arm slowly)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GUY #1
dialog: OK, man. Let's go.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No. I'm not fighting anymore.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: His shoulder went out, man. It's
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: GUY #2
dialog: You guys better get out of here.
text: Guy #2 pushes Dignan. Anthony turns and pounds him in the
text: face. Right on the nose. The guy goes crosseyed. He falls
text: down with his legs all tangled-up in a strange position.
text: Everyone stands there stunned. Anthony takes a step back. He
text: looks up. He and Dignan take off. Bob stands there. Frozen.
text: Everyone looks at him. Bob looks at Little Richard.
scene_heading: LITTLE RICHARD
dialog: Bob?
text: Bob takes off.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. DAY
text: The next day. They're driving with Bob. Dignan's up front.
text: He's banged-up from the fight.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: The guy is fucking insane.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I warned you, Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You said it like it was a big joke,
text: Bob. Like he's wild.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, I was saying crazy like a
dialog: lunatic.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I know that now. He's a fucking
dialog: psycho.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, don't blame me. I told you.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look
text: at her.
text: There's a beautiful GIRL on the sidewalk. They drive past her.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Loop around real fast.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Just turn right here.
text: Bob immediately turns and they drive past the girl again.
text: They don't say anything as they go past her. They all just
text: look at her. They drive on.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A minute later. They've looped back. They're looking for the
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Where'd she go?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Maybe she turned.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: There she is.
text: She's on a side street. Bob hits the brakes hard. The girl
text: looks back at them. They back up a few feet and turn down
text: the street. They drive slowly toward the girl.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Bob, don't be so obvious.
text: The girl keeps looking back at them.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I think we might of scared her.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Let's just go.
text: They come up, beside the girl. She looks right at them,
text: still walking.
text: Her expression is angry and also a little scared.
text: They drive away.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You blew it, Bob.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY
text: Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are meeting with TEMPLE. Temple is
text: in his mid-fifties, short, heavy, completely expressionless
text: wide face. They listen intently as he briefs them on the
dialog: intricacies of firearms.
speaker_heading: TEMPLE
dialog: A gun is a firearm. A pistol is a
dialog: firearm. But anything you hold in
dialog: your hand is a weapon. A knife. A
text: wrench. A ballpoint pen.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: A ballpoiht pen?
speaker_heading: TEMPLE
dialog: Anyone who tells you a ballpoint
dialog: pen is not a weapon needs intensive
dialog: psychiatric treatment. You can
dialog: stick them in the esophagus. You
text: give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.
text: They nod seriously. Temple laughs.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD. DAY
text: They're standing behind Temple's car in the middle of an
text: open pasture. The trunk is open. Temple's got some guns in
text: metal cases. They draw targets on pieces of paper. Anthony

text: different pistols. The last one they shoot's a .44 Magnum.
dialog: They buy it.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY
text: The TV room. There are two big couches and a nice giant TV.
text: The doors are open onto the balcony. The .44 is on the
text: coffee table. Dignan is sitting there with a map and some
text: diagrams laid out. Anthony and Bob are on either side of him.
text: Dignan's pointing at a notebook page with the heading
dialog: "Escape Route."
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: OK. Escape route. The most important
dialog: thing you can have is an escape
dialog: route. Just in case somebody's
text: tailing us. Or even chasing us, as
dialog: the case may be --
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You think we're going to be chased?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: That's a good question. No. I don't.
dialog: I'm just being hypocritical here.
dialog: However, I will say --
text: Bob reaches for the .44.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I'm going to take a look at this.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN

dialog: and the people. You're responsible
dialog: for the external situation. The

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (nods)
dialog: That's my responsibility.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That's your domain.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: OK.
text: Anthony is making a little man out of a scrap of paper.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Now. One thing we need to discuss
dialog: is timing. Timing is absolutely
dialog: crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: Nothing. Go ahead.
text: Bob picks up the gun.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: How many bullets can that hold?
text: Dignan grabs the gun away and sets it down out of Bob's reach.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm paying attention. I just want
text: to look at it for a minute.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: What's your fucking problem? You're
dialog: a shithead!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I just want to see how much bullets
dialog: it takes.
text: Anthony picks up the gun off the table. He clicks the action.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (pulling away)
dialog: No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's
dialog: all of ours.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I paid for it.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: God DAMMIT.
text: Dignan stands up, grabbing his papers.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You two just don't give a shit, do

dialog: Bob's got a Heineken.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: He doesn't get it. Held never
dialog: understand what we're trying to
dialog: accomplish here. It's too dangerous
dialog: for him.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Well, in reality it's not that
dialog: dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous
dialog: if you don't know what you're doing.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, but what if some nut pulled
dialog: gun on you?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: The only nut with a gun is going to
dialog: be Dignan.
text: Anthony gets out of the hot tub and dives in the pool.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (whispering, very serious)
dialog: You know, Bob, Anthony did kill
dialog: someone. He electrocuted our
dialog: janitor senior year.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: He electrocuted someone?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: It was an accidental. I don't want
dialog: to go into the details. It was just
dialog: one of those senior pranks that
dialog: didn't really go right. I mean,
text: obviously, since Swifty's dead.
dialog: That's why Anthony never graduated.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: His name was Swifty?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Yeah. One of the nicest old guys
dialog: you'd ever know.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That's too bad.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (nods)

scene_heading: INT. CAR. NIGHT
text: Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are sitting in Bob's car, parked in
text: the dark. Bob's at the wheel. Anthony and Dignan are in the
text: back. Anthony has on a dark blue ski cap. Dignan's wearing a

text: of adhesive tape across his nose and hands the roll to
dialog: Anthony.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: I'm putting a piece of tape on my
text: nose.
text: Anthony tapes his nose. They stare out the windshield. The

speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (immediately, dead serious)
dialog: Let's get lucky.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. BOOKSTORE. NIGHT
text: Anthony and Dignan walk through the shadows in front of a
text: huge bookstore. The lights are on inside. They watch for a
text: minute and then go to the front door. Dignan hides behind a
text: post. Anthony knocks on the glass. An EMPLOYEE appears.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I left my sweater inside.
text: The employee shakes his head. He can't hear through the glass.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Do you have a lost and found?
text: The employee unlocks the door and opens it an inch.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
dialog: We're closed.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I left my sweater in there.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
dialog: Oh. I see. Come on in.
text: Anthony goes inside. Dignan comes out from behind the post.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
dialog: We're closed, sir.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Where's that guy going?
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
text: He left his sweater.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Well, I left some money in there.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (pulls out the gun)
text: In the cash relister. Step away
text: from the door.
text: Dignan goes in. They walk through the store.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Where's the manager?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Where's the other stocker?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: There's another stocker, right?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: We know there's another stocker.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
dialog: Rob?
text: Dignan points the gun at the employee.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Where is he? Where is Rob?
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
dialog: I don't know. Maybe in literature.
dialog: That's his section.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You got that?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Sure. Literature. The classics.
text: The MANAGER is locking the door of his office.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Is that the manager?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (to manager)
text: Unlock that door.
dialog: (to Anthony)
dialog: Check the aisles.
text: Anthony starts walking through the store, checking down each
text: aisle. He picks up a copy of The Air War on Hitler's Germany
text: and takes it with him. He goes through literature and sees
text: ROB in travel, kneeling in front of a low shelf with a
text: carton of books beside him.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Rob?
speaker_heading: ROB
text: (looks up, a little puzzled)
dialog: Uh-huh?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Why aren't you in literature?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: (hesitates)
text: It's all full up.
text: Dignan is in the office with the manager and the first
text: employee. He's pointing at a drawer.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Open it up.
text: The manager opens it. It's full of office supplies.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: OK. Open the other. Let's go.
text: The manager opens the other drawer. It's full of cash.
text: Dignan looks at the manager. He looks back at the cash.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Put it in one of those.
text: Dignan points at some bookstore bags. The manager picks up a
text: little one and starts to put the money in it.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: A bigger one, you idiot.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: (glares at Dignan)
dialog: Don't call me an idiot, you punk.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I'm sorry. But that bag's too small.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Anthony waiting outside the office door. Rob, the first
text: employee, and the manager are sitting against the wall in
text: the office. The manager's got an intense, angry look on his
text: face, staring at Dignan. Dignan hands Anthony five little
text: bags full of money and starts to close the office door.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: OK, guys. Just...Sit tight.
text: Dignan closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. NIGHT
text: Anthony and Dignan jump into the car.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Go. Go. Drive slow.
text: Bob drives. Pretty slow. Anthony and Dignan keep looking
text: back out the rear window. They're nervous. Nobody says
dialog: anything for a block or two.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: This is natural.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (looks at speedometer)
dialog: That's good. Keep it at forty.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Did we get it?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Be cool, Bob. Be cool.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Make that light.
text: They keep driving. Breathing hard.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: We got it. We got it.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: How much is there?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Don't count it.
scene_heading: EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHT
text: A picnic table in front of a hamburger place. Dignan is
text: standing up with his drink in his hand.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a
dialog: bag!
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No. I was calm.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What about what that guy said?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Oh, shit. That was scary. In the
text: middle of the robbery. The manager
text: looks at me. Right in the eye. And
dialog: goes, I'm going to remember you.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Yeah. He said that.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I swear to God. In a very quiet
text: voice.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Like he meant it.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: Like he would find Dignan. One day.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Like I'm going to hunt you down and
dialog: kill you.
text: Dignan stands there a minute and lets this sink in. Then he
text: finally sits down and they all eat their burgers.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You really think he'll remember you?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No. All he'll remember is a guy
text: with a piece of tape on his nose.
text: They laugh smugly.
scene_heading: EXT. 7-11. NIGHT
text: Anthony, Dignan, and Bob come out of a 7-11. Bob's got a
text: slurpee. He's carrying the WWII book.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: See you.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: See you, Bob.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Hang on, Bob.
text: Dignan goes up to Bob and hugs him. Bob's not smiling.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That was really good driving.
dialog: Seriously. I mean it.
text: Bob nods and starts walking away, down the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: We'll see you later, Bob. Good
dialog: driving.
text: Anthony and Dignan sit on the curb. Anthony's drinking a
text: milk. Dignan's still watching Bob walk alone down the
dialog: sidewalk.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What's wrong with him?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: Anthony, he sat in the car and
text: watched a 4-11 in progress. He got
dialog: what he deserved.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: He was the driver, Dignan. He did
dialog: what he's supposed to do.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I didn't realize you were so
text: sensitive to Bob's feelings.
dialog: Considering I did the plans, you're
dialog: actually lucky you got --
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Don't even say it, man.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY
text: Dignan and Anthony are following Bob through his house. Bob
text: is playing his electric guitar, not plugged in.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Bob, will you please listen?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't want to talk about it.
text: Bob strums more intensely. They're walking through the
text: kitchen.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Look, I admit I was wrong for not
dialog: telling you before the robbery that
dialog: your share wouldn't be as equal as
dialog: ours. But the fact remains me and
dialog: Anthony were much more exposed to
dialog: danger.
text: Bob has now come to the big glass patio doors where Hector
text: sits outside, looking in. Bob keeps playing as he looks at
dialog: Hector.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You
dialog: didn't have some vicious lunatic
dialog: screaming, "I'm going to remember
dialog: you!"
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (smiles slightly,
dialog: keeps playing)
dialog: That's true. That would give me
dialog: nightmares.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Bob, I've got nightmares.
text: Bob stops playing. He looks at Dignan.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You'll probably have them the rest
dialog: of your life.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What was that?
text: Anthony opens the door to the patio.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What?
text: They hear breaking glass somewhere as they follow Anthony
text: onto the patio. A voice yells out.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Motherfucker!
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What's going on?
text: Bob sets down his guitar as they go out of the yard to see
dialog: what's happening.
scene_heading: EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. EVENING
text: Anthony, Dignan, and Bob go around to the front. Bob's
text: neighbor PHIL runs down the driveway with a wrench in his
text: hand. Phil is short and heavy, wearing a golf shirt. He's
text: got a bloody nose.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Phil. What happened?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: Motherfucker. I'll kill him.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (looks around,
dialog: suddenly concerned)
dialog: Who?
text: PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND comes running out the front door.
scene_heading: PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
dialog: I've called the police. Oh, my God,
dialog: Phil.
text: She reaches to hug him.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Don't touch me! I swear to God I'll
dialog: get that guy.
scene_heading: PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
dialog: I know you will, Phil. There was
dialog: nothing you could do. All you had
dialog: was a golf club.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You're bleeding, man. Sit down.
text: A couple of NEIGHBORS have come over from across the street.
speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
text: Some black man beat Phil up.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: He didn't beat me up. He attacked me.
scene_heading: PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
dialog: He took two hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (to Phil)
dialog: Tilt your head back.
text: Later. It's dark out now. There's a police car parked across
text: the street and another pulling over, lights rolling. One of
text: the OFFICERS walks across the yard, shining a flashlight in
text: the bushes. Dignan is talking with one of the other officers.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: He was probably on drugs.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: They usually are.
text: Two other cops are getting a statement from Phil. Anthony
text: and Bob are listening. Some neighbors are milling around
text: talking.
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: As soon as I opened the door I saw
text: him. A black guy. Looking through
dialog: my dad's tool box. I wanted to trap
dialog: this guy. So I closed the garage
text: door.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: And that's when he hit you?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (looking up to sky
dialog: and concentrating)
text: He struck me. I fell down. He took
text: my wallet. Then he opened the
text: garage door and ran away.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: How'd the window break?
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: I hit it with the golf club.
text: Dignan's still talking to the other cop.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: How long do you have to go?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: 26 weeks.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: And what does that cover?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Social issues. Crime prevention.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Hand to hand combat?
text: Dignan suddenly looks toward Bob's backyard. The cop nods.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Ground defense.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Did you hear that?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Shhh.
text: Anthony's looking up into the treetops.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What the fuck is Dignan doing with
dialog: that cop? He loves them.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: There's a million places to hide
dialog: around here.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the
dialog: guy.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I hope not.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Phil probably provoked him.
dialog: (looking at Dignan)
dialog: Where's he going?
text: Dignan and the officer are walking over to the backyard.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: No, it was a rustling sound.
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
dialog: The dog. Look out for the dog.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Is this dog going to bite?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No. Shit no.
text: Dignan jumps the fence. The cop looks over and shines his
text: flashlight. Dignan's petting Hector. Hector's calm.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: See? I don't know what he's talking
dialog: about.
text: Bob starts walking across the street.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Move.
text: As Bob walks away he is looking back, past Anthony, toward
text: the backyard.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What's wrong?
text: Anthony turns to look.
text: In the backyard. Dignan is looking in the bushes.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: He probably went into the next yard.
dialog: Shine the light over here.
text: Dignan looks across the yard at the officer. The officer is
text: shining the light on the marijuana plants. He looks at Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Those are...
text: Dignan sprints across the yard and over the gate.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Halt! Sir!
text: Anthony and Bob are standing in the shadows across the
text: street. They see Dignan come racing down the driveway. The
text: officer is yelling behind the gate.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Bill! He's running!
text: The other officers are running from their cars.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: The prowler! That way!
text: The officers run past Dignan, toward the back. Anthony and
text: Bob take off as Dignan runs by. The three of them run full
text: speed down the street, cutting across yards, between houses.
text: They throw themselves over fences and scramble through bushes.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Way to go, Bob!
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I told you they were there.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (about to explode)
dialog: So it's my fault?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Be quiet.
scene_heading: INT. BOB'S CAR. DAY
text: Bob's at the wheel, Dignan in front, Anthony in the back.
text: They're driving fast down the interstate, past fields and
text: farmhouses. Dignan's drawing out a route in felt tip pen on
text: a Texaco roadmap.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: In all probability nothing would of
dialog: happened. But why take the chance?
dialog: That's why I ran. I mean how many
dialog: plants were even back there? Five?
dialog: Ten?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: There were more than that.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Why don't you just tell them the
dialog: truth. Those belong to my neighbor
dialog: Phil.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know. I personally don't
dialog: need that shit in my life right now.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Nobody does.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Obviously. That's why we go on the
dialog: road. The thing about cops is they
dialog: have short attention spans.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION. DAY
text: Dignan fills up the tank and checks the oil. Bob tests the
text: tire pressure. Anthony does the windows.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Can I get that credit card from you?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I don't like to use that credit
dialog: card, Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Because my mom gets the bill.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: She's not going to notice, Anthony.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I don't want to use it.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, then cut it in half.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I keep it for emergencies.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Anthony, we're on the run. This is
dialog: an emergency. It's only fair that...
text: Anthony gets in the car. Pause. Dignan reaches into his
text: pocket and takes out a wad of cash. He counts some. Stands
text: there a minute. Goes inside to pay.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. DAY
text: Anthony stretches out across the backseat on pillows,
text: playing electronic football. Dignan reads Bob's WWII book.
text: Bob eats a Ding-Dong and smokes a cigarette.
scene_heading: EXT. FIREWORKS STAND. DAY
text: A fireworks stand on the side of the highway. The car's
text: pulled over and they're buying roman candles, M-80's, and
text: Black Cats from a KID wearing a baseball cap way back on his
dialog: head.
text: As they get back on the highway Anthony lights a roman
text: candle and fires it from the window. Dignan lights an M-80
text: and throws it out of the car.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE. DAY
text: They drive to a big lake. A dog splashes in and swims for a
text: tennis ball. Anthony does some nice dives. Dignan swings
text: from a rope out over the water and lets go. Bob sits on a
dialog: bench.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR. DAY
text: Late afternoon. They're driving on the interstate. Anthony's
text: got a copy of Runner's World magazine.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Here's mine right here. See?
text: Anthony lifts up his foot so Dignan can compare his shoe
text: with the picture.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: See if mine are in there.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: (looks at Dignan's shoes)
dialog: Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Yes, they are.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Look at the treads on those.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What about them?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: They obviously weren't designed for
dialog: racing.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Well, those treads stink. You'd
dialog: blow a knee out racing on those.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Will you guys shut up? God. It's
dialog: like having two little kids in the
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: OK, Dad.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Really. OK, Dad. But seriously,
dialog: Anthony. These are fast shoes.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You've never had a pair of fast
dialog: shoes in your life, Dignan.
dialog: (to Bob)
dialog: In fifth grade Dignan used to wear
dialog: cowboy boots for P.E.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I
dialog: wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy
dialog: me any $200 running shoes like
dialog: yours. I wasn't spoiled.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You were spoiled rotten.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Enough. Jesus Christ.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF HIGHWAY. DAY
text: Anthony and Dignan are lined up to race on the side of the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: You want to say it, Bob?
text: Fifty yards away, Bob's sitting on the hood of the car
text: parked on the shoulder. He's reading a magazine. He shakes
text: his head without looking up.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I'll just say it.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I'll say it.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: OK. Go ahead.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: On your marks...
dialog: (waits a second, says
dialog: very fast:)
dialog: Get set go.
text: They take off. Dignan has the jump, but Anthony pulls past
text: him. A car blows by going the other way and they keep racing.
text: Anthony's out in front as they pass Bob sitting on the car.
text: Bob's watching. Dignan raises his fists into the air.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (points at Anthony)
dialog: You owe me fifty bucks.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Anthony won.
text: Bob gets in the car.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: Bob wasn't even looking.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. MOTEL. DAY
text: A Holiday Inn. Bandera, TX. Bob's car is parked in front.
text: Inside: Dignan, Bob, and Anthony are checking in. There's a
text: teenage GIRL behind the counter. Dignan pays cash. The girl
text: hands over the keys. She's looking at Dignan's shirt:
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Was that shirt made from a towel?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (seeing his reaction)
dialog: It's just terrycloth, isn't it?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Yeah. I think so.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL. DAY
text: They're walking along the balcony, looking for their room.
text: Anthony has on his backpack. Dignan's got his tennis bag.
text: Bob's got two large suitcases, a carry-on, and a garment bag.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Look, man. She didn't know anything
dialog: about shirts.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No, I'm not saying her. I'm just
dialog: saying, I don't know.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: It's a great shirt. Don't worry
dialog: about it.
text: They find the room and unlock the door.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. NIGHT
text: Driving in a small town. Bob's behind the wheel. Dignan's in
text: front. Anthony's in back.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Armored trucks are very difficult
dialog: to steal, Anthony.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I know. But once you get inside
dialog: you're home free.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Right.. Get back to me on that one.
dialog: Once your plan is worth a shit.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: It's not a plan. It's just --
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Actually. If you knew the exact
dialog: route, you could plant explosives
text: under a manhole cover and blow it
text: up as it went over.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Yeah, but you wouldn't have the
dialog: truck if you blew it up.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: True.
text: There's a car stopped in front of them. A couple of girls
text: are standing beside it, talking to the driver. Bob can't get
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What the fuck is this?
text: Dignan leans over and holds down the horn for about five
text: seconds. The guy in the car sticks hi s hand out the window
text: and shoots the finger at them. Dignan sounds dead serious:
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Ram him, Bob.
text: Bob waits for a nervous moment. He does two quick honks. The
text: guy's reverse lights go on.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Hit him!
text: Bob hits the gas and slams into the car. He puts his car in
text: reverse and backs up a couple of feet. He leans forward and
text: sees the back of the guy's car. It's all smashed up. The guy
text: gets out of his car, shaken up, and looks at them. His
text: expression is confused. Bob punches it and flies backwards
text: down the street. The guy stands beside his car and watches
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do
dialog: that for?
speaker_heading: BOB
text: He wouldn't move.
text: They go around the corner. Bob shifts into first and goes.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Is he chasing us?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Speed up, Bob.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT
text: They're unlocking the door. They go inside.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You think he got my license plates?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: He looked too shaken-up.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I'm sure he did. We'll have to get
dialog: new plates.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's registered in my mother's name.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: What the fuck possessed you?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're the one who kept saying ram
dialog: him.
text: Dignan's walking into the bathroom.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I meant tap him. As a warning.
text: Dignan closes the door. Anthony lies down on one of the beds.
text: Bob just stands there.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. MORNING
text: The next day. Dignan and Bob are still asleep. Bob's on a
text: folding bed. Anthony's sitting at the table, reading a
text: newspaper eating some cereal from one of those little boxes
dialog: where you cut open the sides.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL POOL. DAY
text: Ahthony's swimming laps. He stops and hangs onto the side
text: for a minute. Across the pool he can see a good-looking
text: Mexican MAID about twenty years old standing beside her cart
text: looking at him. He waves. She waves and gets back to work.
text: A little while later. Anthony's sitting in a chair by the
text: pool, letting the sun dry him off. He's wearing just a
text: swimsuit. Dignan and Bob are fully dressed, standing beside
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Dignan, I can't get my hair cut.
dialog: That's just not possible, all right?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Then you're going to have to dye
dialog: it, Anthony. We've got to hide our
dialog: identities. Especially after Bob
text: crashed the car.
text: Bob has no reaction to this.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Even if it's the difference between
text: some trooper recognizing us and
dialog: throwing us in prison or not?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN

text: She goes in and starts cleaning up. Anthony sits down in one
text: of the chairs and makes conversation.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY

speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Are you ever scared of finding a
dialog: dead body in one of these rooms?
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: It could happen. This is the exact
dialog: kind of place where it happens. But
dialog: I don't want to scare you.
text: Anthony picks up a magazine off somebody's suitcase. He
text: flips through it. Inez takes it out of his hands and puts it
text: back on the suitcase.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. DAY
text: Inez is putting a new bar of soap in the shower. Anthony
text: picks up some wet towels off the floor. It's cramped in there.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: People think because they're in a
dialog: hotel they can act like a slob.
dialog: It's bad manners.
text: Inez takes the towels. She pulls the shower curtain shut.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Were you born in Mexico?
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: Cuba.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Oh, really? That's interesting. Do
dialog: you prefer Cuba or the United States?

dialog: the way.
speaker_heading: INEZ

scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL HALLWAY. DAY

text: He hands the towel to Inez. She holds it to her face.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: My brother's in jail.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What are you talking about?
scene_heading: EXT. BARBERSHOP. DAY
text: They're standing next to the spinning striped pole.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The weed.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: But it's not his. How can they
dialog: arrest Future Man?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: They said he's a drug dealer.
text: Bob looks off into the distance. Sickened.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Those assholes. We got rapes.
dialog: Murders. Violent crimes every

dialog: up with.
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: They're just fucking him because

scene_heading: INT. DINER. DAY
text: They're sitting at a table, waiting for their order.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I don't think they can make it
dialog: stick, Bob. I mean, what do they
dialog: actually have on Future Man?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, the marijuana crop is a good
dialog: start.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That could be anybody's.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: They also found my two beam scale
text: in the garage.
speaker_heading: . DIGNAN
dialog: Since when is it a crime to have a
dialog: scale in your house? Everybody has
dialog: a scale.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The cops say it's a special kind of
dialog: scale drug dealers use in selling
dialog: marijuana.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: So tell them the truth. What do you
dialog: use it for?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I was just going to use it to see
dialog: how much I had.
text: Dignan mulls this over for a minute.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: How long has he been in there?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Then how come they haven't set the
dialog: bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We'll have to see when we get back.
text: Dignan looks at Bob for a minute.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What do you mean get back?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, obviously, we got to go back.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Bob, that makes no sense.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dignan, he's my brother. I can't
dialog: just leave him there.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: This could be a trap.
speaker_heading: . BOB
dialog: Come on, Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm going back.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Not in that car you're not.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Watch me.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Good luck, since I got the keys.
text: Bob glares at Dignan. Dignan shrugs. The waitress brings
text: over some glasses of water, ice clinking. Nobody says
text: anything while she sets them down. She walks away.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Give me the keys, Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I can't do that, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dignan. You're going to give me
dialog: those keys or you're going to get
text: hurt.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Don't threaten me, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If
dialog: you don't give me my keys, I swear
dialog: to God --
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY
text: Dignan drives the car slowly alongside: Bob walking down the
text: sidewalk, staring straight ahead. Dignan's, got his window
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Look, Bob. I understand your
dialog: loyalty. You're a good person. But
dialog: right now you're not using your
dialog: best judgement.
text: Bob keeps walking.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Future Man would not want you to go
dialog: to jail I promise you. Just get in
dialog: the car and we'll talk about it.
text: No reaction. Bob keeps walking straight ahead.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Future Man would never go to jail
dialog: for you, I'll tell you that.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I know it's not.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You don't even know his name.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Yes, I do.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Just get in the car, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What's his name?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You
dialog: know why? Because I don't care.
dialog: He's Future Man. But I care about
dialog: you. And to me it doesn't make
text: sense to go back to the scene of a
dialog: crime. Will you get in the car, Bob?
dialog: This is stupid.
text: Bob stops walking.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It's not your decision and he's not
dialog: your brother, Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That's right. I only have one vote.
dialog: We'll go talk with Anthony and
dialog: figure it out.
text: Pause. Bob gets into the backseat. Dignan looks back at him
text: for a minute.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You're going to ride in the back?
text: Bob nods and looks out the window.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Come on, Bob. Get in front.
text: Bob exhales and gets out. He gets in up front. Dignan looks
text: at him for a minute.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Let's go.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT
text: Dignan and Bob open the door and go in. Inside: Inez and two
text: other Hispanic MAIDS are sitting at the table by the window.
text: One's about seventeen and a little heavy, the other's in her
text: mid-thitties. There's a bunch of glasses and a bottle of rum
text: on the table. One of the maids is cutting up a banana. Inez
text: smiles at Dignan. Dignan looks puzzled.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Hi. How's it going.
text: Suddenly there's a loud crunching, grinding sound. Dignan
text: and Bob are startled. They look around the room. The sound
text: stops.
text: Anthony comes out of the bathroom carrying the pitcher from
text: a blender. It's full to the top with yellow liquid. He sees
text: Dignan and Bob and stops. Pause.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I thought you guys went to get your
dialog: hair cut.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No. We didn't.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: We're making banana daqueris.
text: Anthony holds up the pitcher. Dignan looks at it. Nods. Pause.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Inez, this is --
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Jerry.
dialog: (pointing to Bob)
dialog: And this is my associate Cornelius.
text: A strange expression crosses Bob's face.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: May I have a word with you, please?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL HALLWAY. NIGHT
text: Outside the room. Dignan closes the door. There's three
text: housekeeping carts in the hall.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What the fuck is going on here?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What. What's the matter?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Anthony, we're on the run from the
dialog: law here. Did you tell these people
dialog: your real name?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't
dialog: speak English.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: They don't?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Which one was that?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: On the left.
text: Dignan cracks open the door and looks inside.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: She's from Cuba.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No kidding.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (closes the door)
text: Anthony. Bad news.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL POOL. DAY
text: They walk around the motel.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: How long are they going to hold him?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know. I don't know anything.
dialog: Except Phil says they got him. And
text: he's in jail.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: He needs to hire an attorney.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here
dialog: until we find out what's going on.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Anthony, I --
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: And if Future Man doesn't get let
dialog: out of jail in 48 hours, then we go
dialog: back. All right?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Now that makes sense. We'll hang
dialog: out for a couple of days. Get a
dialog: little R&R. Make sure Future Man's
dialog: OK and then get back on the road.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: As long as he gets out OK.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Obviously. That's a given.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Is that OK?
text: Pause. Bob looks at Dignan. Looks at Anthony.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Yeah. I guess so.
text: They shake hands and start back to the room.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: See, now we've got a plan.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Don't worry about it, Bob.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT
text: Anthony, Dignan, Inez, Carmen, and Anita are sitting crowded
text: around the little table by the window in the motel room.
text: They've got banana daqueris and a bottle of wine. Moonlight
text: comes through the window. Bob is standing up in front of
text: them with a banana daqueri in his hand. He's singing a blues
dialog: number acapella. He's got a good voice.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT
text: Dignan and Bob are playing slapjack with Carmen and Anita.
text: Everyone's got their hands ready as Carmen turns one card
text: then the next. Bob's having a conversation in fluent Spanish
text: with them about Las Vegas. He's talking about the rules at
text: different casinos: Bally's, Caesar's, the Desert Inn.
text: Dignan's paying close attention to the deck. A jack comes up
text: and he slams it.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL POOL. NIGHT
text: There's a light in the pool. Anthony and Inez are swimming.
text: Anthony swims around her with his eyes just above the water.
text: He goes under and comes up grabbing onto her. She laughs.
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (passionate)
text: God, yes. Like silk.
text: .Inez starts to giggle.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What?
dialog: (starts laughing)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: Like silk?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: God. That does sound corny. Oh,
dialog: your skin feels so soft and silky.
dialog: But it really kind of does.
text: He kisses her.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No lifeguard on duty. Swim at your
dialog: own risk.
text: They look up. Dignan's standng at the other side of the pool.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You know, I did save Anthony from
dialog: drowning once, Inez. Tell her,
dialog: Anthony.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Dignan sitting with his feet in the pool. Anthony and Inez
text: are sitting on the steps beside him, in the shallow end.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: See, one day we were playing hot
text: box over at my next door neighbor
text: Mr. Langston's house and Anthony
text: fell in the pool and got knocked
text: unconscious. I had to dive in and
dialog: save him.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: This was in fourth grade.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Mr. Langston performed
text: cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR.
dialog: I've never said this before, but
dialog: frankly I thought Anthony was dead.
text: The veins in his face were all
text: sticking out. His skin was blue. He
text: truly did look dead.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: After that my parents never let me
dialog: go to Dignan's again.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: They blamed my family for everything.
dialog: They always said Mr. Langston saved
dialog: Anthony's life.
text: Dignan stares wistfully across the pool. Anthony looks at
text: him for a minute.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: But if it wasn't for Dignan I
dialog: probably would of died.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: (nodding, whisper voice)
dialog: Yes...It's true.
text: They're all quiet for a minute. Inez hangs onto the side.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT
text: Bob's sitting in the room by himself, close to the TV,
text: watching a war movie.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL. DAY
text: The next morning. Dignan bursts out the door of the motel
text: room. He runs across the parking lot.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Son of a bitch.
text: Dignan runs back into the room. He comes out with Anthony.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: He's gone. He stole the car.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Where was it parked?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Right here.
text: Anthony looks around the parking lot.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That coward. Son of a bitch.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Maybe he just went to the store.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: He took his stuff. He's gone.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I should of seen this. I should of
text: expected it. Bob doesn't have any
dialog: character.
text: Anthony puts his hands in his pockets. Looks out at the
dialog: highway.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: He went back for his brother.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: We said 48 hours.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: That's a long time to be in jail.
text: They stand there in the empty parking lot. Anthony goes
text: inside.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY
text: In the room. The blinds are pulled. Anthony's sitting at the
text: end of a bed. Dignan's pacing around the room.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: We'll get him. Don't worry about
dialog: that. We'll go back. We'll find him.
dialog: And we'll blow up his car. Or do
dialog: something. I promise you.
text: Anthony gets up and walks to the bathroom. He shuts the door.
text: Dignan follows him over to the sink and sits on the counter.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I mean, let's face it. Bob was dead
dialog: weight. We're a lot better off
text: without him.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But who could expect it? Just like
dialog: that. Steals the fucking car. What
dialog: kind of person pulls that --
text: Anthony opens the door and walks out.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Bob didn't steal the car. He told
dialog: me he was going. He had to go help
dialog: his brother.
text: Anthony sits back down on the bed. Dignan's shocked.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: When'd he tell you?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: This morning.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Where was I?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You were asleep.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: He told you and you let him do it.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: He told me because he wanted to
dialog: know if I wanted to go.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: If you wanted to go? What were you
dialog: going to do? Just leave me here by
dialog: myself?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Well, I didn't do it, did I?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: So when you were saying Bob's at
text: the store and acting real suprised,
dialog: that was just an act. You were
dialog: just --
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Bob went to help his brother. I
dialog: understand that and I can't help it
dialog: if you don't.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I understand that if I had a few
dialog: more friends like you and Bob I'd
dialog: be dead.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: If you say so.
scene_heading: INT. DINER. DAY
text: Anthony and Dignan are sitting at a booth. Anthony's got a
text: roadmap spread out on the table. There's a long silence.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: If you'd gone with Bob you'd
dialog: probably be in Weatherford by now.
dialog: Of course I'd be here frantically
dialog: worrying thinking you must of got
dialog: kidnapped.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I didn't realize you had such an
dialog: incredible ability to feel sorry
dialog: for yourself, Dignan.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Well, the world is a little bit
dialog: colder today.
text: Anthony sits there thinking for a second, stating into space.
text: Then he looks back at his map. He draws some lines in two
text: different colors of felt tip pens.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You want to look at the map?
text: Pause. Dignan kind of looks at the map, without leaning
text: forward. Anthony turns the map more in Dignan's direction.
text: Dignan leans forward, looking.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: See. Here's where we are.
text: They look at the map for a minute. Dignan looks out the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I didn't know he had it in him.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I guess you could say the child has
text: become the father of the man.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. MOTEL/TOWN. DAY
text: Anthony runs down the sidewalk, cuts across the street, and
text: goes around the side of the motel. He pulls off his jacket
text: as he goes up the stairs. He spots Inez's cart. He walks
text: over to the room she's cleaning. She's in there making the
text: bed. Anthony closes the door and grabs her by her belt.
text: She's laughing and he pushes her onto the bed. He unbuttons
text: her dress. She jerks a sheet out of the way. It swings in
text: the air.
text: Then we see Anthony and Inez walking down the sidewalk. He's
text: got one arm wrapped tight around her shoulders and she's got
text: hers around his waist. They're talking while they walk,
text: going past people in the town.
text: They watch each other walking reflected in a window.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL. EVENING
text: Dignan is doing the butterfly in the pool. Anthony and Inez
text: walk over and wait for him at the end of the pool.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: We're going over to this bar if you
dialog: feel like going.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you
dialog: later.
text: Dignan treads water. Inez looks at Anthony.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Why don't you come with us.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: OK.
text: Dignan gets out of the pool.
scene_heading: INT. MEXICAN BAR. NIGHT
text: Anthony, Dignan, and Inez are drinking beers with limes and
text: salt. The mood is good and they're getting drunk. Anthony
text: and Inez dance. Then Dignan and Inez. Mexican-style, stomping
text: their feet and clapping. There's a scruffy dog in the bar
text: and he barks at the dancers. Anthony kisses Inez and they
text: whisper to each other. Dignan orders another beer and moves
text: over to the pool table. A skinny Mexican MAN puts his arm
text: around Dignan's shoulder. He's drunk and slurring his words.
dialog: So's Dignan.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hello, my friend. You in the Army,
dialog: yes?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Play pool? For one cerveza.
text: Dignan nods. The guy racks up the balls. They start shooting.
text: Dignan makes a hard shot.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You a good pool player.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Got a little lucky.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Where's your friend? He go with the

text: Dignan looks over to the bar. Anthony and Inez are gone.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MAN
text: She is a good looking woman.
text: Dignan ignores this. They keep playing. Dignan finally makes
text: the eight ball. The man shakes Dignan's hand and holds on.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Guess I'll get another Tecate.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Fight. You know.
text: He pulls Dignan in and with his other hand fakes a hard punch.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No. Just pool.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You Hoto?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (pulls away)

speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Right.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT
text: The bathroom is very small with one bare light bulb. Dignan
text: stands at the urinal, muttering to himself.
text: The door opens and Dignan turns around just in time to see
text: the Mexican man throw a hard punch. He hits Dignan in the
text: stomach, punches him in the face. Dignan goes down hard. The
text: guy kicks him and curses in Spanish.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Pinche cabrone. Puta madre.
text: The bartender comes in with a bat in his hand and starts

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT
text: Dignan's sitting in bed, watching TV. He's got a fat lip and
text: a big bruise over his eye. Anthony's sitting in a chair
text: beside him. Inez brings over a glass of water and some ice
text: in a washcloth. She gives the ice to Dignan for his eye. She
text: puts the glass of water on the nightstand where there's some
text: fast food layed out for Dignan: burger, fries, an apple pie.
text: Inez goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and turns on
text: the water. Anthony's sitting there with his hands clasped,
text: not looking at the TV.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I can't believe he just jumped you.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Can you hand me those french fries.
text: Anthony hands him the fries. Dignan watches the TV.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I wish I'd been there.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Would of been nice.
text: Anthony looks at Dignan.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a
dialog: walk --
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I don't really feel like talking
dialog: about it. The only thing I feel
dialog: like is getting the fuck out of
dialog: this place.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We need a car.
text: For the first time Dignan looks away from the TV, at Anthony.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I have an idea for that.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Inez has a master key to all these
dialog: rooms, doesn't she?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Doesn't she?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I don't think we can do that.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I know we can. It's real simple. We
text: go into a room, grab some car keys
dialog: and --
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What I'm saying is she wouldn't go
dialog: for that.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: She doesn't need to know.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I don't know, Dignan. I just --
speaker_heading: . DIGNAN
dialog: Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out
dialog: of here. It's real torture for me
dialog: to be here. Getting the shit kicked
dialog: out of me by Mexicans.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Shh.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No one to back me up. Now I have a
dialog: good idea. So unless you come up
dialog: with something better --
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Dignan. I can't do that. All right?
dialog: I just can't.
text: The bathroom door opens.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Then you better think of something.
text: Inez comes back in.
speaker_heading: INEZ
dialog: How are you, Jerry?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (staring at TV)
dialog: I feel great, Inez.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (kisses her)
dialog: I'll see you later.
text: Inez goes outside. She closes the door.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I don't think we need any keys,
dialog: Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car
dialog: for us.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You don't know how to hotwire.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Bob taught you how to get
text: electrocuted.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: No, I'm serious. He made me a
dialog: diagram.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK. DAY
text: Dignan's standing on a corner alone. He looks sullen.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK. DAY
text: Anthony walks down an alley. He goes past a beat-up
text: convertible. He stops, hands in his pockets. He looks both
dialog: ways.
text: He cuts back to the car, opens the door, and slips inside.
scene_heading: INT. STOLEN CAR. DAY
text: Anthony's behind the wheel. He hand signals a turn and pulls
text: up next to Dignan. Dignan shakes his head as he looks at the
text: car. He gets in. They drive through the town. The wind's
text: blowing hard. Anthony smiles at Dignan. Dignan tries not to
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Dignan sitting in the parked car with the motor running. In
text: the side mirror he's watching Anthony and Inez. Anthony's
text: saying goodbye. He walks back to the car and gets in. He
text: puts it in gear and they drive off.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What'd you say to Inez?
text: Anthony shrugs.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: "I'll come back for you. I love
dialog: you, Inez."
text: Anthony is silent.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: "I'm going to take you away from
dialog: all this windexing and making beds."
text: Silence. Dignan exhales and looks out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY
text: The car is on the shoulder, raised up on a Jack with the
text: hood open. Anthony's looking underneath the car. Dignan's
text: standing in the middle the road with his hands in his
text: pockets. No cars in sight.
text: Anthony starts messing around under the hood. He tests some
text: wires and connections. He steps away from the car.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Man, I don't know anything about
dialog: cars.
text: Dignan stares down the road.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You really know how to pick them.
text: Anthony walks over to Dignan. He stands beside him for a
dialog: minute.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I think we better go home.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Don't panic, Anthony.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I'm not. But there's --
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You can't just run home every time
dialog: things get tough. First of all,
dialog: we've got enough dough to --
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Our money situation is not good.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: (clapping him on the back)
dialog: You're so spoiled. What is "not
dialog: good" to you? Only a few hundred --
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: We've got sixteen dollars.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That's not correct.
text: Dignan stares at Anthony.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Give it to me.
text: Pause. Anthony reaches into his pocket and pulls out the
text: money. Dignan takes it. He counts it. He looks at Anthony.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Sixteen dollars.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Where's the rest?
text: Dignan stares at Anthony. Pause.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I had to give some to Inez.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: $383.
text: Dignan frowns slightly. Pause. He screams:
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What!
text: Pause. Dignan runs at the car and kicks the door as hard as
text: he can. It makes a big dent. He runs down the shoulder and
text: grabs a big rock. He runs at the car and smashes the rock
text: through the windshield. He stands still. He turns to Anthony.
text: He walks back over to him, yelling.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You gave $383 to the goddamn
dialog: housekeeper! What the fuck is your
dialog: problem?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: She needed it.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Her name's Inez. Stop calling her
text: the housekeeper.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That's what she is!
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I know that. But --
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: You're in love with the fucking
dialog: housekeeper!
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What are you going to do, get
dialog: married? Have a bunch of little
dialog: idiot janitor brats! And go around
dialog: scrubbing the --
text: Anthony slaps Dignan hard in the face.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Stop!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Now listen to me.
text: Dignan punches Anthony is the face. Follows it up with one
text: after another. Anthony ducks and puts his arms out. He falls
text: on one knee. Dignan immediately turns and walks to the car.
text: Anthony stands up. He's got a bloody nose. He stares at
text: Dignan. Not angry. Just weary.
text: Dignan pulls his tennis bag out of the car. He shuts the
text: door and walks down the highway.
text: Anthony walks to the car and takes out his backpack. He
text: pulls it tight around his shoulders. He looks down the
text: highway at Dignan. Then turns and walks the other way, into
text: the distance.
speaker_heading: BLACKOUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. GOLF COURSE. DAY
text: A cold day on a nice country club course. Anthony watches
text: Bob hit a hard slide straight into the rough. Bob stands
text: there in a frozen follow-through. Then he suddenly swings
text: his club and hums it down the fareway. He starts to walk
text: back to the golf cart.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Bob, where you going?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm not playing any more golf.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Cause I'm not getting any better.
dialog: It's a waste of time.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You've only been playing for two
dialog: weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to
dialog: learn this game.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You think I'm improving?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yes. You just got to stick with it.
text: Bob looks down the fareway. He takes a deep breath and
text: starts walking toward his club about twenty yards away.
scene_heading: INT. GOLF CART. DAY
text: In the cart. Bob's driving. There's a brief silence.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You don't have to talk about it if
dialog: you don't want to.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: No, I don't mind.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I know it must of been a bad
dialog: experience. But it doesn't sound
dialog: like it was your fault.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Well, I didn't mean to electrocute
dialog: him. But the whole operation was my
dialog: idea.
text: MONTAGE: Electronics wizardry. Splicing wires. Buzzing
text: electrodes. A filament lights up blue. Pliers and clippers
text: rewire a circuit breaker, short out the P.A. system,
text: electrify doors and windows. Anthony continues in VOICEOVER.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY (VO)
dialog: It took six months of research. I
dialog: did all the wiring myself. Switched
dialog: AC to DC. Doubled the voltage.
text: Shorted out the generator. The
dialog: whole school was shut down.
speaker_heading: BOB (VO)
dialog: That's pretty complicated for a
text: senior prank.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY (VO)
dialog: I don't like that word prank, Bob.
dialog: I was trying to do something more
dialog: than a prank.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL. DAY
text: A large school building. Tall oak trees and benches in the
text: shade. Green and blue lights blink in the windows. White
text: flashes and loud jolts of energy dance from room to room.
text: Mozart plays in the distance.
text: Students begin to swarm out into the yard.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY (VO)
dialog: I wanted to create an event.
dialog: Something everyone would remember.
dialog: And at first it worked perfectly.
dialog: The whole school was standing
text: around outside. Kids running all
text: over the place. Everybody laughing.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLF COURSE. DAY
text: Anthony and Bob are standing on the seventeenth green.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: Even the school custodian Swifty
dialog: thought it was great. He kept
text: laughing and shaking his head the
dialog: whole time he tried to disconnect
text: the generator. And then suddenly
dialog: (snaps his finger)
text: total silence except for Swifty
text: hanging off the generator with his
text: leg stuck to it being electrocuted.
text: Anthony stares down the fareway.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Actually he died of a heart attack
text: brought on by the shock. He was an
text: older guy.
scene_heading: INT. GOLF CART. DAY
text: Anthony and Bob are driving back to the clubhouse.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I felt terrible. I'd known Swifty
dialog: since first grade. He was Dignan's
dialog: medicine man for Indian Guides.
dialog: They called each other Rattlesnake
text: and Killer Whale. Whenever Dignan
dialog: came to visit me he would act like
dialog: he and Swifty weren't that good of
dialog: friends, but that was just to make
dialog: me feel better. The whole rest of
dialog: the school had turned against me.
scene_heading: EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY
text: Anthony and Bob are sitting by the pool, drinking beers.
text: Future Man's swimming laps even though it's cold out.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: At first they were going to charge
dialog: me with manslaughter. That's partly
dialog: why I was in custody so long. Sixty
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Sixty days?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Yeah. One minute you're studying
dialog: Great Expectations and the next
dialog: minute you're drawing the Holy Mary
dialog: for some kid who tried to stab his
dialog: girlfriend.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty
dialog: good. It's not like drawing on paper.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Future Man toweling off. He wears a Speedo swimsuit. He
text: walks over to Bob and Anthony. Anthony's just finishing a
text: drawing of a leaping jungle cat in black and red ink on
text: Bob's shoulder.
text: Future Man stops and looks at them with no feeling.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (pause)
text: It's a panther.
text: Pause. Future Man looks at Bob.
speaker_heading: FUTURE MAN
dialog: How's that 700 bucks coming?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'm working on it.
speaker_heading: FUTURE MAN
text: Hard to find it sitting by the pool
text: drinking beer and bullshitting.
text: He walks inside.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: I thought he didn't have to pay
dialog: anything because of the technicality.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, but he still has the
text: aggravation. Three days sitting in
text: a cell.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Were you adopted, Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Well, because you guys don't look
dialog: alike.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No. I wasn't adopted.
text: Long pause.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Was Future Man adopted?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Jesus Christ! No.
scene_heading: INT. CAR. DAY
text: Dignan and APPLEJACK are sitting in, a '72 Monte Carlo by
text: the curb two houses down from Bob's. Applejack is a small
text: black man with white hair. It's hard to tell exactly how old
text: he is. Around sixty-five.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: There's a lot of valuable shit in
text: there, Applejack. The silver and
dialog: the china. The crystal. And the
dialog: grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet
dialog: that clock's worth ten grand.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: Why the fuck do we need to blow up
dialog: the car? It doesn't make any
dialog: goddamn sense.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Just settling an old score. You
dialog: might say revenge.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: That sounds like a lot of bullshit
dialog: that'll land us in jail.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: We might have to take that chance.
dialog: Cause I feel pretty strongly about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: Is that Buckethead?
text: Anthony is walking Hector down the driveway.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Get down.
text: Anthony does some stretching exercises in the driveway.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: Is that him?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Wait a second.
text: They watch Anthony and Hector start down the street.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That's Anthony.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: That's your friend Anthony?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: What's he doing here?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
text: Looks like he's staying with
dialog: Buckethead. That's what I figured.
dialog: He's probably got his own room.
dialog: Let's see where he's going.
text: Applejack puts the car in gear. They drive slowly.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Don't get too close.
text: Anthony looks back.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Stop. He saw us.
text: Anthony keeps jogging with Hector.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Wait. Did he see us?
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
text: We're going too slow. It looks like
dialog: we're following him.
text: Anthony goes around a corner, down an alley.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Speed up.
text: They pull down to the end of the alley. Anthony and Hector
text: are racing down the alley.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY. DAY
text: Dignan gets out of the car.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Anthony!
text: Anthony looks back. He stops running.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Wait up.
text: Dignan jogs down the alley. He stops a few feet away from
dialog: Anthony.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Where you going?
text: Anthony points down the alley.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
text: Just walking Hector.
text: Dignan looks down the alley. He looks at Anthony. Pause.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: When'd you get back?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Ah. Couple days ago.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: You want to shake hands.
text: Anthony puts his hand out. They shake. Pause. Anthony looks
text: down the alley.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Who's in the car?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: That's Applejack. You want to meet
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Sure.
text: They walk to the car.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: This is Applejack.
text: They shake.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Nice to meet you, Applejack.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: You're Anthony?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: I hear you're a good thief.
text: Anthony shrugs and smiles. He nods.
scene_heading: EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. DAY
text: A hamburger place with no other customers. Anthony, Dignan,
text: and Applejack are sitting at an outdoor table. It's cold and
text: their jackets are zipped up tight.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: I'm just sitting at this bar
dialog: drinking my drink when this fine
text: chick walks by. She was a living
dialog: doll. And the big motherfucker who
text: came in with her sees me looking,
text: when he walks by he steps on my
dialog: foot. Doesn't say shit. Just takes
dialog: a seat with his lady. Well, I
text: holler out to him, If I was as big
dialog: as you, ain't no way in the hell
dialog: you'd of stepped on my foot like
dialog: that. He just laughed. He says,
dialog: Little man, take your foot and put
dialog: it in your pocket. I said, No, how
dialog: about I take my foot and I stick it
dialog: up your ass? Man, we went to war
text: right there. I hit him so hard I
text: knocked his nuts in his watchpocket.
dialog: But this motherfucker wouldn't go
text: down. Then all the sudden, out of
text: nowhere, Dignan came up behind him
text: and smashed a bottle on his head.
dialog: And that big old boy went down.
dialog: That's how I met Dignan. Good cat
dialog: to have on your side. He'll go to
dialog: war with you. He don't give a fuck.
text: Applelack and Dignan slap hands.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Applejack would of got him anyway.
dialog: This was just the quicker war.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You really hit a guy with a bottle?
text: Dignan takes a little notebook out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Pretty much. He kind of fell into
dialog: me. But wait a second.
text: Dignan opens the notebook on the table.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I want you to look at this.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's

scene_heading: EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY
text: Anthony, Dignan, and Applejack are standing in front of a

dialog: Cold Storage.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Mr. Henry has an inside source. We
dialog: call him Steve. That's where we get

speaker_heading: ANTHONY

speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Uh-uh.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: S. Cooper Trust,in San Francisco?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Uh-uh.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965.
dialog: It's famous. Applejack was the
dialog: wheel man. Did you use this same
dialog: car, Applejack?
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: Hell, no. This is a '72. I was

scene_heading: . ANTHONY

scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE. DAY
text: Anthony, Dignan, and Applejack are standing on the sidewalk

speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What time did he say to be here?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Right now.
text: Dignan looks in the window. He tries the door. It's locked.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: I can knock a man out with a six
dialog: inch punch.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY

speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: Feel this.
text: Anthony puts his hand up. Applejack does a short, hard jab.

text: Dignan puts his hand up. Applejack nails it.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (grabbing his hand)
dialog: Ow. Shit.

text: up. There's a man on the roof. He laughs, hysterically. They
text: stare up at him.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: How's the weather down there?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Mr. Henry?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Come on in!
speaker_heading: DIGNAN

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: No, it's not.

scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: This is no good, bringing him here.
dialog: What are you thinking? What the

text: Mr. Henry stares at Dignan. He looks to Anthony.
scene_heading: MR. HENRY

speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: It's hard to get much spin with
dialog: this kind of paddle.
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: It's called a racquet, Anthony, and
dialog: you're holding it wrong. That's
dialog: ghetto play. Hold it like this.
text: Anthony changes his grip. Mr. Henry serves. The ball clicks
text: back and forth. They're both solid players. Anthony whips a
text: shot crosscourt and wins the point.
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: You know, your form is for shit,
dialog: but you've got a hell of a talent.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Thanks.

scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: Every once in a while some cat
dialog: comes to me. He wants to know how I
dialog: made it. How did I become a success?
dialog: The first thing I tell them is:
dialog: follow your instincts. Let your
dialog: instincts guide you. The second
dialog: thing I tell them is, for Christ's
dialog: sake: you got to know your grammar.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Grammar.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: What do you mean grammar?
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: The basic grammatical rules of
text: robbing.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: You mean like techniques?
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Technique. That's right. Seventy-
dialog: five percent of your job is crowd
dialog: control. Seventy-five percent. Do
dialog: you believe that?

dialog: Irish. Or maybe --
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: I guess what I'm trying to say is
dialog: what the hell kind of person is
dialog: this Dignan?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: What do you mean what kind of
dialog: person? He's a good person.
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: Sure, sure. He's a great person,

dialog: if the kid has the goods
dialog: (taps his temple)
dialog: up here.
scene_heading: . ANTHONY
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: I don't think you're giving him
dialog: enough credit. I know sometimes he
text: doesn't think an idea through. He
dialog: gets too excited. But --
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: As far as I can tell he hasn't
dialog: thought his life through. He'd be

dialog: car. But business?
dialog: (looks at Anthony)
dialog: You I can work with. You I could
text: groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
text: Anthony stops running. Mr. Henry stops ahead of him and

dialog: You just made a perfect score.
text: Anthony has to recover.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: That was a test?
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: Take a deep breath.

text: shoulders. He takes Anthony's head in his arms and does a
text: quick pull to one side: cracks his neck. Then the other side.
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: How does that feel?
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: It feels good.
text: Anthony rubs his hands on his neck and moves his head around.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Did Dignan take the test?
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yes, he did.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: How'd he do?
text: They start jogging again.
scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: Well, he agreed 100% that Bob
dialog: should be dropped. And he also
dialog: agreed you were a liability. But he
dialog: felt his talent would make up for
dialog: your weaknesses.

scene_heading: MR. HENRY

dialog: having a party. The damn job's not
text: over yet.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Well, this isn't really a party per
dialog: se.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: You don't celebrate til it's over.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: True.
text: Dignan's solemn for a minute. He takes a bite of a hot dog.
speaker_heading: APPLEJACK
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?

scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: Exactly. Woah.

scene_heading: MR. HENRY
dialog: The fear of death, The pain of

scene_heading: MR. HENRY

speaker_heading: APPLEJACK (VO)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Bob! Get back in position!
text: For just a second we hear the sound of music playing.
text: Everyone freezes. FOUR GUYS, two of them in jumpsuits like

speaker_heading: DIGNAN

speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Help me move him.
speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Careful. Check his pulse.
text: Anthony holds all the guys at gunpoint. Dignan and Bob carry

speaker_heading: . DIGNAN
dialog: Is he breathing?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I think so.

speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
speaker_heading: BOB
text: I didn't think there was an alarm.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Take him to the car, Bob.

speaker_heading: DIGNAN

speaker_heading: ANTHONY

speaker_heading: DIGNAN

speaker_heading: ANTHONY

speaker_heading: DIGNAN

speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: No. That's true.

text: Dignan leans toward the fence.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: Hey.
text: He motions for them to come closer to the fence. He whispers:
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: I think I may have found a way out

speaker_heading: ANTHONY

dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN

speaker_heading: ANTHONY

speaker_heading: DIGNAN

speaker_heading: ANTHONY
dialog: Dignan, I --

speaker_heading: ANTHONY

text: Dignan shuffles along with the rest of the inmates. He looks
text: at Anthony and Bob. He smiles. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: DIGNAN
dialog: So long.
text: Bob and Anthony slowly half-smile. They wave to Dignan as
text: the line of inmates turns away. Anthony looks to Bob. Bob
text: smiles.
text: The line of inmates stops about fifty feet away. Dignan
text: looks back. Anthony looks at him. Dignan's expression has
text: changed. He wasn't expecting them to see it. His eyes look
text: cold. Anthony puts his hand on the fence. Dignan turns and
text: the line of inmates disappears into the cell block.
text: Anthony stands there in silence.. He lets go of the fence.
