speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY)
text: LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop. She is in her early-
text: thirties, but too old to be doing this. She is very pretty
text: and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift. She
text: is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus
text: tray underneath the counter. It is making a lot of RACKET,
text: which she is oblivious to. There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the
text: b.g., which she hums along with.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING
text: THELMA is a housewife. It's morning and she is slamming
text: coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink,
text: which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left
text: from last night's dinner which had to "soak". She is still
text: in her nightgown. The TV is ON in the b.g.
text: From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering
text: project going on in the dining room, an obvious "do-it-
dialog: yourself" attempt by Thelma.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - MORNING
text: Louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Phone RINGS. Thelma goes over to answer it.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (hollering)
dialog: I got it! Hello.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - MORNING
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (at pay phone)
dialog: I hope you're packed, little
dialog: housewife, 'cause we are outta her
dialog: tonight.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Well, wait now. I still have to ask
dialog: Darryl if I can go.
speaker_heading: LOUISE (V.O.)
dialog: You mean you haven't asked him yet?
dialog: For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your
dialog: husband or your father? It's just
dialog: two days. For God's sake, Thelma.
dialog: Don't be a child. Just tell him
dialog: you're goin' with me, for cryin' out
dialog: loud. Tell him I'm havin' a nervous
dialog: breakdown.
text: Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out
text: coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board
text: already covered with them. We see various recipes torn out
dialog: from women's magazines along the lines of "101 Ways to Cook
dialog: Pork."
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: He already thinks you're out of your
dialog: mind, Louise, that don't carry much
dialog: weight with Darryl. Are you at work?
speaker_heading: LOUISE (V.O.)
dialog: No, I'm callin' from the Playboy
dialog: Mansion.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I'll call you right back.
text: Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the
text: stairs and leans on the banister.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Darryl! Honey, you'd better hurry
dialog: up.
text: DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs. Polyester was made
text: for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry. He
dialog: manages a Carpeteria.
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like
dialog: that! Haven't I told you I can't
dialog: stand it when you holler in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want
dialog: you to be late.
text: Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and
text: it's obvious he likes what he sees. He exudes over-confidence
dialog: for reasons that never become apparent. He likes to think
text: of himself as a real lady killer.
text: He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed
text: hair. Thelma watches approvingly.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Hon.
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (she decides not to
dialog: tell him)
dialog: Have a good day at work today.
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Hon?
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: You want anything special for dinner?
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what
dialog: we have for dinner. I may not even
dialog: make it home for dinner. You know
dialog: how Fridays are.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Funny how so many people wanna buy
dialog: carpet on a Friday night. You'd
dialog: almost think they's want to forget
dialog: about it for the weekend.
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: Well then, it's a good thing you're
dialog: not regional manager and I am.
text: He's finally ready. He walks to the door and gives Thelma
text: the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: 'Bye, honey. I won't wait up.
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: See ya.
text: Darryl leaves. We see his Corvette parked out front. As he
text: closes the front door, Thelma leans against it.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: He's gonna shit.
text: Thelma laughs to herself. She goes back into the kitchen
text: and picks up the phone and dials it.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - MORNING
text: The pay phone on the wall RINGS. ALBERT, a busboy in his
text: 50's, answers.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Good morning. Why, yes, she is. Is
dialog: this Thelma? Oh, Thelma, when you
dialog: gonna run away with me?
text: Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (to Albert)
dialog: Not this weekend, sweetie, she's
dialog: runnin' away with me.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hi. What'd he say?
speaker_heading: THELMA (V.O.)
dialog: What time are you gonna pick me up?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: You're kiddin'! Alright! I'll be
dialog: there around two or three.
speaker_heading: THELMA (V.O.)
dialog: What kind of stuff do I bring?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I don't know. Warm stuff, I guess.
dialog: It's the mountains. I guess it gets
dialog: cold at night. I'm just gonna bring
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: THELMA (V.O.)
dialog: Okay. I will, too.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
speaker_heading: THELMA (V.O.)
dialog: I don't know how to fish, Louise.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl
dialog: does it, how hard can it be? I'll
dialog: see you later. Be ready.
text: They both hang up.
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY
text: Going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel
text: pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way
text: too much stuff for a two-day trip. REVEAL Thelma, standing
text: in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring,
text: as if she's forgotten something. The room looks like it was
text: decorated entirely from a Sears catalog. It's really frilly.
scene_heading: INT. LOUISE'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY
text: A perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and
text: orderly. Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long
text: underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe,
text: one nightgown. She could be packing for camp.
text: REVEAL Louise. Her room is as orderly as the suitcase.
text: Everything matches. It's not quite as frilly as Thelma's,
text: but it is of the same ilk. She is debating whether to take
text: an extra pair of socks. She decides not to and closes the
text: suitcase. She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials. We
dialog: hear:
speaker_heading: ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)
dialog: Hi. This is Jimmy. I'm not here
dialog: right now, but I'll probably be back
dialog: 'cause... all my stuff's here. Leave
dialog: a message.
text: Louise slams down the phone. A framed picture of Louise and
text: Jimmy sits on the table next to the phone. She matter-of-
text: factly slams that face down, too.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now. She talks
text: to herself quietly the whole time.
text: She is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock,
dialog: fingernail scissors, etc.
text: She opens the drawer of her nightstand. Her attitude is
text: purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's
text: doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision
text: is completely arbitrary. As she rifles through it, plucking
text: various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there
text: is a gun in there, one Darryl bought her for protection. It
text: is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets. She picks up
text: the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (muttering to herself)
dialog: Psycho killers...
text: She grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too. She
text: tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out
text: all over the place. She stuffs things back in the sides and
text: heaves all her weight against the top.
scene_heading: EXT. THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Louise's green '66 T-Bird convertible pulls into the driveway
text: of Thelma's house. The garage door goes up and Thelma is
text: standing in the garage with all her gear. A suitcase that
text: looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a
text: lantern. Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in
text: there, too. Louise gets out of the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: We don't need the lantern. The place
dialog: has electricity.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I wanna take it anyway. Just in
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: In case of what?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: In case there's some escaped psycho
text: killer on the loose, who cuts the
text: electricity off and tries to come in
dialog: and kill us.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (going along with her)
dialog: Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern
dialog: will come in real handy. Maybe we
dialog: could tow your car behind, in case
text: he steals the spark plugs.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: We'd have to. That thing barely
text: makes it down the driveway.
text: They load everything into the car. The trunk barely closes.
text: Thelma heaves all her weight against it. They get into the
text: car and pull out of the driveway. As they drive down the
text: street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl.
text: She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the
dialog: air.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - DAY
text: They are driving down the interstate. Thelma reaches for
text: her purse and finds the gun.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise, will you take care of the
dialog: gun?
text: Louise shrieks at the sight of it.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Why in hell did you bring that?
text: Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Oh, come on, Louise... psycho killers,
dialog: bears... snakes! I just don't know
dialog: how to use it. So will you take
dialog: care of it?
text: Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse
text: and holds it in her hand. She tests the weight of it, and
text: then puts it under the seat. Thelma puts the bullets under
dialog: the seat.
text: They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring.
text: Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&amp;B MUSIC.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Whose place is this again?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: It's Bob's, the day manager's. He's
dialog: gettin' a divorce, so his wife's
dialog: gettin' this place, so he's just
dialog: lettin' all his friends use it till
text: he has to turn over the keys.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I've never had the chance to go out
dialog: of town without Darryl.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: How come he let you go?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: 'Cause I didn't ask him.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Well, he has never let me go. He
dialog: never lets me do one goddamn thing
dialog: that's any fun. All he wants me to
dialog: do is hang around the house the whole
dialog: time while he's out doing God only
dialog: knows what.
text: They are both silent for a minute.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (looking straight
dialog: ahead)
dialog: I left him a note. I left him stuff
dialog: to microwave.
text: After a pause.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I guess you haven't heard anything
dialog: from Jimmy... yet?
text: Louise's jaw tightens. The car speeds up.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: ...never mind.
text: A huge semi-tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway
text: and HONKS. The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked
text: women. There is a bumper sticker on the back that says:
dialog: "Lick you all over -- ten cents."
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: One of your friends?
text: Thelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to
dialog: smoke a cigarette.
text: THELMA'S POV OF A SIGN alongside the road that reads "See
dialog: you in church on Sunday!"
text: Thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out.
text: Louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: How much longer is it gonna be? I'm
dialog: hungry.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Another hour of so. We've got enough
dialog: food for a month.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I'll never make it... Can't we stop
dialog: just for a few minutes...
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: We've not gonna get to the cabin
text: till after dark as it is, Thelma.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Then what difference does it make if
dialog: we stop? Come on. I never get to
dialog: do stuff like this.
text: Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager
text: and continue whining unless she gives in.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Alright, but it's gonna be a quick
dialog: stop.
scene_heading: EXT. SILVER BULLET - NIGHT
text: They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with
text: neon. It's called the SILVER BULLET. The sign flashes
scene_heading: COCKTAILS -- BEER -- DANCING -- FOOD. There is a huge gravel
text: parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars. Even
dialog: though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night
text: spot. It's already pretty crowded.
scene_heading: INT. SILVER BULLET - NIGHT
text: This place is jumpin'. There are ten pool tables with crowds
text: all around. The long bar is filled with customers.
text: There are tables and booths. The room is dense with smoke.
text: There is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because
dialog: the band is still setting up. There are a lot of single
text: men. Many heads turn and follow Thelma and Louise to an
text: empty table.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I haven't seen a place like this
dialog: since I left Texas.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Isn't this fun?
text: A WAITRESS comes over and drops two menus on the table.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Y'all wanna drink?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I'll have Wild Turkey straight up
dialog: and a Coke back, please.
text: As the Waitress leaves:
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Thelma!
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Tell me somethin'. Is this my
dialog: vacation or isn't it? I mean, God,
dialog: you're as bad as Darryl.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I just haven't seen you like this in
dialog: a while. I'm used to seeing you
text: more sedate.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Well, I've had it up to my ass with
dialog: sedate! You said you and me was
dialog: gonna get outta town and, for once,
dialog: just really let our hair down. Well,
dialog: darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is
dialog: comin' down!
text: As the Waitress returns:
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Alright...
dialog: (to Waitress)
dialog: I changed my mind. I'll have a
text: margarita with and a shot of Cuervo
dialog: on the side, please.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Yeah!
text: As the Waitress leaves, a MAN comes over with a chair which
text: he pulls up to the table and straddles backwards.
text: He is in his late-40's, heavyset, his face is shiny in the
text: neon light.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Now what are a couple of Kewpie dolls
dialog: like you doin' in a place like this?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Mindin' our own
dialog: business, why don't
dialog: you try it.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Well, we left town for the
dialog: weekend 'cause we wanted
dialog: to try and have a good
dialog: time. And because Louise
dialog: here is mad because her
dialog: boyfriend won't call her
dialog: while he's out on the
dialog: road...
text: Louise kicks Thelma under the table.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (quieter)
dialog: We just wanted to get somethin' to
dialog: eat.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Well, you come to the right place.
dialog: You like chili? They got good chili.
text: The Waitress returns with Louise's drink.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Harlan, are you botherin' these poor
dialog: girls?
speaker_heading: HARLAN (MAN)
dialog: Hell, no. I was just bein' friendly.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (making eye contact
dialog: with Louise)
dialog: It's a good thing they're not all as
dialog: friendly as you.
text: Louise understands.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Your name's Harlan? I got an uncle
dialog: named Harlan!
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: You do? Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause
dialog: if he is, then he and I got somethin'
dialog: in common.
text: Harlan laughs. Thelma laughs, too, but doesn't really get
text: the joke. Louise does not laugh.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (to Harlan)
dialog: I don't mean to be rude, but I've
dialog: got something I need to talk to my
text: friend about. In private.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Aw, I understand. I didn't mean to
dialog: bother ya. It's just hard not to
dialog: notice two such pretty ladies as
dialog: yourselves.
dialog: (standing, to Thelma)
dialog: You better dance with me before you
dialog: leave, or I'll never forgive you.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Oh, sure. That'd be fun.
dialog: Harlan leaves, then:
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Can't you tell when somebody's hittin'
dialog: on you?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: So what if he was? It's all your
dialog: years of waitin' tables has made you
dialog: jaded, that's all.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Well, just relax, will ya. You're
dialog: makin' me nervous.
text: Thelma knocks back her shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her
text: glass to the Waitress to bring her another one. The Waitress
text: sees her and nods. She turns back to face her friend.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Givin' him a taste of his own
dialog: medicine. Asshole.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I'm sorry, Louise. I know you're
dialog: all upset. It's just I'm so excited
dialog: to be out of the house, I guess.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Why don't you tell him to just to
dialog: get lost once and for all?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Why don't you ditch that loser husband
dialog: of yours?
text: They both drift off momentarily, contemplating their domestic
text: problems, until the Waitress comes over:
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (rolling her eyes)
dialog: This one's on Harlan.
text: Thelma looks over at the bar where Harlan is grinning at
text: her, making dancing motions. She smiles and waves at him.
text: Her face becomes serious again as she turns back to Louise.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Jimmy'll come in off the road, you
dialog: won't be there, he'll freak out and
dialog: call you a hundred thousand times,
dialog: and Sunday night you'll call him
dialog: back and, by Monday. He'll be kissin'
dialog: the ground you walk on.
text: Thelma's mind goes too fast for her mouth, and the speed at
text: which she speaks can be staggering. Louise is used to it.
text: Louise smiles wistfully at Thelma's assessment of the
dialog: situation.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: In the meantime, you said we were
dialog: gonna have some fun. So let's have
dialog: some!
text: She again drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up
text: her glass, as the BAND strikes up a lively tune.
text: Practically the whole place "whoops" and heads for the dance
text: floor. Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her
dialog: glass, too.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while.
text: Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN. Thelma
text: is breathless, drunk and giggly. She holds a beer bottle in
text: one hand. She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan
text: is studying her closely. Louise notices this.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (over the noise)
dialog: Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little
dialog: girls' room, and then we gotta hit
dialog: the road.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (eyes closed, swaying
dialog: with the music)
dialog: Ready when you are.
text: Louise heads off to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (eyes still closed)
dialog: Louise, I'm gonna come with you.
dialog: (she gets a funny
dialog: look on her face)
dialog: I don't feel so good.
text: She stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle.
text: Louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a
text: line of at least fifteen women in front of her.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: (catching Thelma,
dialog: copping feels)
dialog: Oopsy-doopsy. We need to get you
dialog: some fresh air, little lady.
text: He steers her towards the door.
text: Louise leans against the wall, waiting in line.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Harlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot.
text: She is pretty limp.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Oh shit.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Stop.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I'm spinning.
scene_heading: INT. SILVER BULLET - NIGHT
text: The Waitress is going over to their table. She picks up
text: Thelma's purse off the floor and puts it on her chair.
text: She sets the check on the table, looks around to see if she
text: can see them and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Louise goes into the bathroom. She stands in front of the
text: sink and looks at herself in the mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Thelma has been sick. She has Harlan's handkerchief and is
text: wiping her mouth. Harlan has backed off for this part, but
text: he's right back in there.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: How you feelin' now, darlin'?
text: Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her
text: head away.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I guess I'm startin' to feel a little
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty
dialog: good to me, too.
text: He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her.
text: Thelma pulls away.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: I think I need to keep walking.
scene_heading: INT. SILVER BULLET - NIGHT
text: Louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in.
text: She scans the room looking for Thelma. She doesn't see her.
text: She goes over to the table and sees Thelma's stuff there.
text: She picks up the check and looks at it.
scene_heading: EXT. SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot.
text: He is trying to kiss her now. He is pushing her arms down
text: and turning her head away.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Don't. I'm married. I don't feel
dialog: good. I've been sick.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: It's okay. I'm married, too.
text: Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning
text: to push him away harder.
scene_heading: INT. SILVER BULLET - NIGHT
text: Louise is paying the Waitress. The Waitress is shaking her
text: head, indicating she hasn't seen Thelma either.
text: Louise picks up Thelma's stuff and heads towards the door.
scene_heading: EXT. SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and
text: is kissing her neck. He has her ass in his hands. He is
text: beginning to hump her. She is pushing him away as hard as
text: she can, but he is relentless.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: (breathing heavily)
dialog: You're beautiful. It's okay. I
dialog: won't hurt you. It's okay.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: Stop it! Goddamnit, I mean it!
dialog: Louise is gonna wonder where I am.
dialog: Let go!
speaker_heading: HARLAN
text: Louise is alright.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
text: is now standing outside the door of the Silver Bullet. She
text: is looking around.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
text: is pulling at Thelma's clothes. Thelma gets one of her arms
text: free and hits him hard in the face. He hits her back and
text: grabs her face, squeezing it hard.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Don't you hit me! Don't you fucking
dialog: hit me!
text: There is no trace of friendliness in his face now. He looks
text: mean and dangerous. He lets go of her face and pins her
text: arms behind her. He holds both of her arms with one hand.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: You just shut up.
text: With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her
text: dress up. Thelma is still struggling and there are tears
text: running down her face.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Don't hurt me. Harlan. Please.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Shut up.
text: He turns her around, pushing her face down onto the back of
text: the car. He holds both her arms in one hand and continues
text: pulling her dress up over her hips. He starts to undo his
text: pants as we hear the CRUNCH of gravel.
speaker_heading: LOUISE (O.S.)
dialog: Let her go.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Get lost.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise!
text: TIGHT SHOT of the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into
text: the nape of Harlan's neck. Louise's thumb pulls back the
dialog: hammer.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: You let her go, you fat fucking
dialog: asshole, or I'm gonna splatter your
dialog: ugly face all over this nice car.

text: out, pulling her dress down.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Now, calm down. We were just havin'
dialog: a little fun.
text: Louise glances at Thelma. Thelma shakes her head no.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Looks like you've got a real fucked
dialog: up idea of fun. Now turn around.
text: Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to
text: his face. His pants are undone in the front. She is still
text: backing away with the gun raised. Thelma is inching away as
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Just for the future, when a woman's
dialog: crying like that, she's not having
dialog: any fun!
text: Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second. Then
text: she turns and walks away. Thelma does, too.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: (pulling up his pants)
dialog: Bitch. I should have gone ahead and
dialog: fucked her.
text: Louise stops in her tracks.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: I said suck my cock.
text: Louise takes two long strides back towards him, raises the
text: gun and FIRES a bullet into his face. We hear his body HIT
text: the gravel parking lot. LOUISE'S POV. The car behind him
text: is splattered with blood. Thelma and Louise are both silent.
text: We hear the SOUND of the nightclub in the distance. Louise
text: lowers the gun.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Get the car.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Jesus Christ! Louise, you shot him.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Get the car!
text: Thelma runs to get the car.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (quietly, to herself)
dialog: You watch your mouth, buddy.
text: Thelma comes careening up in reverse. Louise hops in and
text: Thelma PEELS OUT, spraying gravel. As they speed out of the
text: parking lot back to the road, we hear MUSIC blaring from the
text: nightclub. They hit the main road with tires SQUEALING.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Get back to the interstate.
text: Louise lifts her hand and notices she is still holding the
dialog: gun.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Shit! I... I, which way?

speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise.
text: Louise does not answer.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise. Where are we going?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (shaking)
dialog: I don't know, Thelma! I don't know!
dialog: Just shut up a minute so I can think.
text: Thelma starts to cry quietly.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Shouldn't we go to the cops? I mean,
dialog: I think we should tell the police.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Tell them what?! What, Thelma?
dialog: What do you think we should tell
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I don't know. Just tell 'em what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Which part?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: All of it. That he tried to rape

speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Only about a hundred people saw you

dialog: that?! We just don't live in that
dialog: kind of world. Pull over!
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT
text: Thelma pulls off to the side of the road. Louise gets out
text: and starts to walk around the car. She stops when she gets
text: to the back of the car, and she is sick. Thelma waits in
text: the car and moves over to the passenger side. Louise gets
text: in the driver's side.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise... Are you alright?
text: Louise rests her head on the steering wheel.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Oh Christ.
dialog: (to Thelma)
dialog: Thelma.
text: Thelma doesn't hear.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Thelma.
text: Thelma looks at her blankly, without answering.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I've gotta stop for a minute. I've
dialog: got to get it together. I'm gonna
dialog: find a place to get a cup of coffee
dialog: and I'm gonna sit down for a second.
dialog: Do you want to come?
text: Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly. Louise studies
text: Thelma's face.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Is that yes? Are you up to this?
text: Again, Thelma slightly moves her head in a nod. Louise puts

scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK STOP - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: The green '66 T-Bird pulls into a modern truck stop and parks.
text: Louise turns to Thelma.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: We gotta be inconspicuous. Do you
dialog: know what that means?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: It means you don't talk to anybody.
dialog: You don't draw attention to yourself
dialog: in any way. Do you understand that?
text: Again, she twitches more than nods.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Tell me you understand that.
text: Thelma nods more firmly now. She understands.
text: VARIOUS POV SHOTS of truck drivers seeing Thelma and Louise

scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP - TIGHT SHOT - WAITRESS' HANDS - 4 A.M.
text: slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray

text: outside, near the door.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (halfway to herself)
dialog: We have to think this through. We
dialog: have to be smart. Now is not the
dialog: time to panic. If we panic now,
dialog: we're done for. Nobody saw it.
dialog: Nobody knows it was us. We're still
dialog: okay. Now all we have to do is just
dialog: figure out our next move.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Our next move? I'll say one thing,
dialog: Louise. This is some vacation. I
dialog: sure am having a good time. This is
dialog: real fun.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: If you weren't so concerned with
dialog: having a good time, we wouldn't be
dialog: here right now.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Just what is that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: It means shut up, Thelma.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: So this is all my fault, is it.
text: Louise looks at Thelma for a long time.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Just shut up.
text: The Waitress comes and fills their coffee cups.
text: Thelma stands up to go to the bathroom. She grabs her purse
text: from the counter, and the strap catches on her coffee cup
text: and it falls to the floor with a CRASH. All heads turn and
text: look at her.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I have to go to the bathroom. I...
dialog: Sorry.
text: HOLD on Louise.
scene_heading: EXT. SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - 4:00 A.M.
text: Police cars are parked around. The activity has died down.
text: Doors on the coroner's van SLAM shut. In the back of a police
text: car sits the Waitress with the door open. A DETECTIVE in a
text: suit leans over the car door with his note pad.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Could you identify 'em, if ya saw
dialog: 'em again?
speaker_heading: LENA (WAITRESS)
dialog: Hal, I've told you about twenty times,
dialog: yes, I could identify 'em, but neither
dialog: one of them was the type to pull
dialog: something like this.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Well, you're not exactly an expert
dialog: witness, but what makes you so sure?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: If waitin' tables in a bar don't
dialog: make you an expert on human nature,
dialog: then nothin' will, and I could've
dialog: told you that Harlan Puckett would
dialog: end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot.
dialog: I'm just surprised it didn't happen
dialog: before now.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Who do you think did it?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Has anybody asked his wife? She's
dialog: the one I hope did it.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Lena, just cut the bullshit, will
dialog: ya? Do have any ideas or don't ya?
dialog: I been standin' in this stupid parkin'
dialog: lot all goddamn night, and I still
dialog: got to go file a report before I can
dialog: go home in time to get back up again!
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it
dialog: was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's
dialog: husband. But it wasn't either one
dialog: of those two. The tall one, the
dialog: redhead, she left me a huge tip.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You didn't happen to notice what
dialog: kind of car they were driving?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: It's a nightclub, not a drive-in,
dialog: Hal. I don't follow the customers
text: to the parking lot.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Alright, Lena. Go on home. We might
dialog: have to call you in for some more
dialog: questioning.
text: Lena gets out of the back of the car.
speaker_heading: LENA

scene_heading: INT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Thanks. I'll try later.
text: She hangs up and goes into the bathroom. As the door closes
text: behind her, Louise comes up with a handful of change and
text: starts putting it into the phone. She dials a number. It
text: RINGS for a long time. She hangs up and goes into the
text: bathroom. She looks at herself in the mirror.
text: She notices a tiny speck on her cheek. She takes a paper
text: towel and wets it and rubs the spot. She looks at the towel
text: and there is a bright red streak.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Thelma... Come on, Thelma!
text: The door of the stall flies open and Thelma comes charging
text: out and heads straight for the door, without even looking at
text: Louise. Louise charges out after her. They head out of the
text: restaurant and, THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see them get into the
text: car and drive away.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - DRIVING SHOT - DAWN
text: The T-Bird barrels down a fairly empty four-lane highway.

scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAWN

speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: We're gonna go to the next town and
dialog: stop. We'll get a motel room. I
dialog: can rest for a while and then figure

dialog: gonna need money. Thelma. How much
dialog: money do you have with you?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: What? Oh, I don't know. Let me
dialog: look.
text: Thelma is rummaging through her purse. She finds her wallet
text: and takes it out. Thelma finds some bills stuffed in the
text: change compartment and takes them out. She straightens the
dialog: money out.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Sixty-four dollars.
text: As she is counting it, one of the bills flies out of her
dialog: hands. Thelma's not that good at handling money.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Umm. Shit. Forty-four dollars.
text: Louise has not noticed any of this. She is so intent on her
dialog: driving.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I'm cash poor.
speaker_heading: LOUISE

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY (6 A.M.)
text: The curtains are open and we can see the car parked right

text: the ceiling. Louise is bustling around the room, putting
text: things in drawers.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Why are you unpacking? You said we
dialog: were just gonna take a nap.
text: Louise did not realize she was doing it.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Oh, I don't know. I'm just nervous.

speaker_heading: THELMA

speaker_heading: LOUISE

speaker_heading: LOUISE

text: They are silent for a moment.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: You could help me try and figure it
dialog: out! I gotta figure out what to do,
dialog: and you could try and help me.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I suggested we go to the police, but
dialog: you didn't like that; so, frankly,
dialog: Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Well, what's the big rush, Thelma?
dialog: If we just give 'em some time, they'll
dialog: come to us...! Oh Christ. I'm just
dialog: not ready to go to jail yet. Why
dialog: don't you go out to the pool or
dialog: something and I'll figure it out...
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Give me the keys.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: You're not touchin' that car.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: My stuff's in the trunk! God! You

dialog: but that car always gets me out of
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE GARAGE - DAY
text: Hal is at the police station where they're dusting the car
text: with Harlan all over it for prints. Hal looks closely at
text: the back of the car. He holds his hands over two sets of
text: hand prints. He moves his hands to the outside of the prints
text: so as not to smear them, and puts his hands on the car. His
text: face is one inch away from the trunk. He sees a very clear
text: drop of blood. It's different than any of the other blood
text: splatters on the car. He calls the identification technician
text: over and points it out.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: What's that?
text: The I.D. TECH comes over and looks and shrugs his shoulders.
speaker_heading: I.D. TECH
dialog: Blood?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Whose?
speaker_heading: I.D. TECH
dialog: His, I guess...
text: Hal makes a face like he suddenly felt a slight toothache.
text: He stares at the guy.
speaker_heading: HAL

scene_heading: INT. COUNTRY STORE - DAY
text: Thelma in store buying gum, beef jerky. Next to the cash

text: Turkey and puts in on the counter. The Old Man rings it up.
text: She takes another one and puts it on the counter.
text: The Old Man is still ringing stuff up.
text: She takes two more and puts them on the counter. She takes
text: the rest of the little bottles of Wild Turkey out of the
text: display and puts them on the counter. She takes one little
text: bottle of Cuervo and puts it down on the counter, too. The
text: Old Man finally looks at her. From the wall behind him, he
text: takes a pint of Wild Turkey down.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Ma'am, are you sure you wouldn't

scene_heading: EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY STORE - DAY
text: Thelma comes out of the front of the store. The store is at

speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Go call Darryl.
text: Thelma is walking towards the car. She puts her purse in
text: the front seat. She looks at Louise.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Call him?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Call him. Don't tell him anything.
dialog: Tell him you're having a wonderful
dialog: time and you'll be home tomorrow
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Will I be?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I don't know. I won't be.

speaker_heading: DARRYL

scene_heading: EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I'm... I'm with Louise. We're in

scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: What in the hell do you think you're

scene_heading: EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Darryl... baby... Darryl, calm down
dialog: now, honey. Please don't get so
dialog: mad. I can explain...
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Darryl is mad, but he's still watching the game.
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: Hold on. Hold on a minute, damnit.
text: He covers the mouthpiece and watches a play where "his team"
text: fumbles the ball. This only makes him madder. He puts the
text: phone back to his ear in time to hear Thelma say:
speaker_heading: THELMA (V.O.)
dialog: ...only for one day and we'll be
dialog: back tomorrow night.
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: No you won't. You'll be back today.
dialog: Now! You get your ass back here,
dialog: Thelma, now, Goddamnit. Thelma, do
dialog: you understand me?
scene_heading: EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY
text: Thelma is trying not to cry. She's trying to be strong.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Darryl, please... You're my husband,
dialog: not my father, Darryl.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: That does it! That Louise is nothin'

text: Neither one of them say anything for a moment.
speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: Thelma?
scene_heading: EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Darryl.
speaker_heading: DARRYL (V.O.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Go fuck yourself.
text: She hangs up on him.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY STORE - DAY
text: Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching
text: the ground as she storms back to the car. So she makes a
text: loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see.
text: Both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of
dialog: the collision.
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: Whoa! Excuse me! Miss, are you
dialog: alright?
text: Thelma nods her head "yes," but tears continue. Her crying
text: is silent.
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: Is there anything I can do?
text: Thelma shakes her head "no." She tries to control her tears.
text: She notices how blue his eyes are.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: No. Thanks. Sorry.
speaker_heading: THELMA
text: collects herself as she walks back to the car. She gets in
text: and is drying her eyes, looking in the side mirror. In the
text: mirror she sees the Hitchhiker come back around from the
text: side of the building. He is several feet behind the car,
text: and she watches him as he removes his long-sleeved shirt and
text: stuffs it into his duffel bag. Now he is just in T-shirt
text: and jeans. He looks good. Really good. She watches in the
text: mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road.
text: She can see him as he's walking. He stops. He's thinking.
text: He heads over to the car.
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: Would you mind me asking which
dialog: direction you and your friend are
dialog: going? I'm trying to get back to
dialog: school and my ride fell through, so
dialog: I'm kinda stuck. Are you going my
dialog: way?
text: Thelma doesn't know what to do.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Umm. I think we're going to Oklahoma
dialog: City. But I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: Do you think you could... I mean, I
dialog: could help pay for gas.
text: Thelma knows Louise isn't going to like this.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Ummm. Well, see, it's not really up
dialog: to me. It's not my car. Umm, we'll
dialog: have to ask my friend, but she'll
dialog: probably say no. She's a little
dialog: uptight.
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: Well. Maybe we better not ask her.
dialog: But thank you anyway.
text: Now she wants him to come. He starts to walk away from the
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Well, we can ask her. That won't
dialog: hurt.
text: Just then Louise comes out of the store. She sees Thelma
text: talking to this guy and, for one moment, stops dead in her
text: tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car.
text: Although her face is basically expressionless, we see that
dialog: it's possible she might kill Thelma.
speaker_heading: THELMA
text: Louise, this young man is on his way
text: back to school and needs a ride, and
dialog: I thought since...
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: It's probably not a good idea.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise.
text: The Hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road.
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: Y'all have a nice day. Drive safe.
text: The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated
text: that Louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to
dialog: confront her.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: See how polite he is? He was really
dialog: nice.
text: Louise lowers the top and backs the car out. They watch him
dialog: walk away.
text: Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road. They
text: pass the Hitchhiker. Thelma waves.
speaker_heading: HITCHHIKER
dialog: (to Thelma)
dialog: You cheer up now!
text: She turns around in the seat to continue waving. He smiles
text: and waves. They drive down the road. TIGHT SHOT of the
text: Hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DRIVING - DAY
text: Thelma looking sulky.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I wish we could've brought him with

speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What did Darryl say?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: He said "Okay, Thelma. I just wanted
dialog: to know you were alright. I hope
dialog: you're havin' a good time. You sure
dialog: deserve one after puttin' up with me
dialog: all the time. I love you, honey."

scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: It's twenty minutes later. They are clear of the town.
text: Thelma is like a dog with a bone. She just won't let it
dialog: drop.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I just don't see what it would hurt
dialog: just to give somebody a ride. Did
dialog: you see his butt? Darryl doesn't
dialog: have a cute butt. You could park a
text: car in the shadow of his ass.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood
dialog: for company right now. Here. Take
dialog: this map. I need you to find all
dialog: the secondary roads to Mexico from
dialog: Oklahoma City. I think we should
dialog: stay off the interstates. We're too
dialog: conspicuous.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (taking map)
dialog: Well, it looks like we can get on
text: this road 81 that heads down towards
dialog: Dallas, then cut over to...
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I don't want to go that way. Find a
dialog: way that we don't have to go through
dialog: Texas.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (looking at map)
dialog: Wait. What? You want to go to Mexico
dialog: from Oklahoma and you don't want to
dialog: go through Texas?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: You know how I feel about Texas...
dialog: We're not going that way.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I know, Louise, but we're running
dialog: for our lives! Don't you think you
dialog: could make an exception just this
dialog: once?! I mean, look at the map.
dialog: The only thing between Oklahoma and
dialog: Mexico is Texas!
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Thelma! I'm not gonna talk about
dialog: this! Now find another way or give
dialog: me the goddamn map and I will! You
dialog: understand?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: No, Louise. How come you never said
dialog: what happened?
dialog: Louise is completely unreasonable on this subject and Thelma
text: is totally puzzled by Louise's reaction but is reluctant to
dialog: press her further.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I... I just... I just don't think
dialog: it's the place I wanna get caught
dialog: for doin' something like... if you
text: blow a guy's head off with his pants
dialog: down, believe me, Texas is the last
dialog: place you wanna get caught! Trust
dialog: me! Now, I said, I don't wanna talk
dialog: about it!!
text: Louise looks very shaken up. She keeps her eyes on the road
text: but she's holding the steering wheel so tightly, her knuckles
text: are white. She does not look at Thelma. Suddenly she reaches
text: over and locks her door. Thelma flinches imperceptibly at
dialog: this gesture.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Okay. We'll go around Texas to get
dialog: to Mexico. This is crazy.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - FARMLAND - DAY
text: Two Harley-Davidson bikes tool past, driven by a couple of

speaker_heading: THELMA
text: Louise and Darryl don't get along.
speaker_heading: LOUISE

text: J.D. is looking down the road, way off in the distance.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Better slow down. That's a cop.

text: She glides along as the cop car passes on the other side
text: without seeing them.
text: Louise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual

dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: It's me.
text: The following eleven roses are held out the door, then Louise
text: is yanked inside and we hear her shriek with LAUGHTER.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - EVENING
text: Thelma has taken a shower and is dressed in cut-offs and a T-
text: shirt. Her hair is still damp but she looks better than she
text: did when she arrived. Thelma is fixing a drink of Wild Turkey
text: and Diet 7-Up in one of the motel room glasses. There is a
text: KNOCK on the door. She stops what she is doing and is
text: completely still.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise?
text: Another KNOCK.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise, is that you?
speaker_heading: J.D. (O.S.)
dialog: (through the door)
dialog: Thelma? It's me.
text: Thelma opens the door and there stands J.D., soaking wet
text: from the rain pouring down behind him.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I just thought I... I know I'm
dialog: supposed to be gone, but...
text: He's kind of looking over towards the road. He's still
text: slightly shy.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I'm not havin' much luck gettin' a
dialog: ride.
text: He notices looking past her into the room that Louise isn't
text: there. Thelma just stands there looking at him.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Well, I guess I'd better...
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Wait...! Um, where ya going?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I don't know. Nowhere. What are
dialog: you doin'?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I don't know. Nothin'. Took a
dialog: shower.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: That sounds nice.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Well, you wanna use the shower?
dialog: You can tell he does want to but doesn't want to say so.
text: So instead he just kind of stands there with a reticent grin
text: on his face.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Oh. I... where's Louise?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: She's off with Jimmy, that's her
dialog: boyfriend.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: That's lonely for you, I guess. I
dialog: always think of motel rooms as lonely.
dialog: Thelma pretends like she's had a lot of experience with this
dialog: sort of thing.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (letting him in the
dialog: door)
dialog: Oh, yes, well, they can be.
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jimmy is pouring champagne into Louise's glass. There are a
text: dozen roses in a vase on the table. He pours for himself as
text: he sits as close to Louise as possible.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Now, my little coconut, what seems
dialog: to be the trouble here? Tell Daddy
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (cringing)
dialog: Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it
dialog: kind of gives me the creeps when you
dialog: do that...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Okay, okay, just tell me what's the
dialog: trouble.
text: Louise just looks at him for a minute.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Jimmy, I'm not gonna tell ya what
dialog: the trouble is. Someday soon you'll
dialog: understand why I can't. But I won't
dialog: tell ya, so don't ask me.
text: Jimmy is once again shocked by how serious she is.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (almost at a loss for
dialog: words)
dialog: Okay, peaches, okay. But can I ask
dialog: you one thing?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Does it have something to do with
dialog: another guy? Are you in love with
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: It's nothin' like that.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Then what?! What, goddamnit, Louise!
dialog: Where the fuck are you going? Are
dialog: you just leaving for fucking ever?
dialog: What, did you fuckin' murder somebody
dialog: or what?!
text: Louise spills her champagne.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Stop it! Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll
dialog: leave right now. I'm not kiddin'!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (calming down)
dialog: Alright, alright. I'm sorry.
text: They both take a second to regain their composure.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Can I just ask you one other thing?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Maybe.
text: Jimmy pulls a little black box out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Will you wear this?
text: He hands Louise the box. She opens it and it is a diamond
text: ring. Louise is flabbergasted.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Will you at least see how it fits?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Jimmy... it's beautiful!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You didn't see that one comin', did
dialog: ya?
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: J.D. is out of the shower standing in front of the mirror
text: wearing only his jeans, the top button of which is still
text: undone and no shirt. He has an incredible physique. He
text: also has a tattoo on his shoulder of the homemade variety.
text: Thelma has gone and bought cheese crackers and peanuts from
text: a vending machine and is into her second Wild Turkey and 7-
text: Up. She sits on the bed, watching him in the mirror. He
text: definitely looks better with his shirt off.
text: She suddenly feels awkward and stands up.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: You wanna drink?
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Louise has the engagement ring on her finger. It's really
dialog: beautiful.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So whaddya think. I mean... I
dialog: could... uh... get a job. Of some
dialog: kind. I mean you've been tellin' me
dialog: that for years, right?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Why now, Jimmy?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (this is hard for him)
dialog: 'Cause, Louise. I don't want to
dialog: lose you. And for some reason I get
dialog: the feelin' you're about to split.
dialog: Permanently.
text: Louise doesn't know how to respond. She struggles for a
dialog: reply.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Jimmy, we've gone all these years...
dialog: we never made it work. We're not
dialog: gonna be able to just... I'm not...
dialog: What kind of job, honey? Can you
dialog: see it. I can't.
text: Jimmy doesn't answer right away. He's trying to see it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'm the one... I never made it work.
dialog: I just... It's not that I don't love
dialog: you. It's not that. I just never
dialog: thought I'd be thirty-six years old
dialog: and I never thought... I don't know
dialog: what I thought. What do you want,
dialog: darlin'. What do you want me to do.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I don't know. It doesn't even matter
dialog: anymore. I just want you to be
dialog: happy... It's not that I don't love
dialog: you either. But Jimmy, your timing
dialog: couldn't be worse.
text: Jimmy does not really understand why this is happening.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Are you just doin' this to punish
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Believe me, the last thing I want is
dialog: for you to get punished.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Thelma has poured a drink for J.D. who's sitting on the edge
text: of the bed. She walks over and hands it to him and as she
text: does, he takes the drink with one hand and her hand with the
text: other. He sets the drink down on the nightstand and holds
text: her hand with both of his. He closely studies her wedding
text: ring. He suddenly looks up at her and gazes at her just as
text: intently. He slowly shakes his head as he removes her ring
dialog: as if to say, "This is not right for you. This isn't going
text: to work." He looks at the ring as he moves it through space
text: finally stopping when the ring is directly over his drink.
text: He drops it in. He looks back at Thelma and smiles as if to
text: say, "There. Now don't you feel better?" He smartly kisses
text: her hand.
scene_heading: INT. JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Louise and Jimmy are sitting on the edge of the bed.
text: Jimmy has put the ring on her finger and they both are looking
text: at it, as Jimmy holds her hand in his. They both ponder it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It does look good.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: J.D. is standing on the dresser with a towel tied around his
text: neck like a cape.
dialog: J.D.
text: Faster than a speeding green T-Bird,
dialog: able to leap tall babes in a single
dialog: bound...
text: He leaps from the dresser and flies across the room landing
text: on the bed, straddling Thelma.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: (in his deep man's
dialog: voice)
dialog: Hi. Could I interest you in some
dialog: Fuller brushes?
text: Thelma has not stopped laughing since he came in the room.
text: He is the greatest guy she's ever seen. He is sniffing her
text: neck like a dog.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: Stop, stop, stop!
text: Thelma tries to catch her breath.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Who are you?
text: J.D. attacks her again.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I am the great and powerful Oz...
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: J.D.! Just tell me. I know you're
dialog: not some schoolboy. Now come on,
dialog: nobody ever tells me shit.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I'm just some guy. A guy whose parole
dialog: officer is probably having a shit
dialog: fit right about now.
text: Thelma gasps.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: What?! Parole officer? You mean
dialog: you're a criminal?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Well, not anymore, Thelma, except
dialog: for bustin' parole, I haven't done
dialog: one wrong thing.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: What did ya do?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I'm a robber.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: You're a bank robber?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Nope. I've never robbed a bank.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: What?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Well, I robbed a gas station once,
dialog: and I robbed a couple of liquor
text: stores, and some convenience stores.
dialog: And that's it.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: How?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Well, I was just down on my luck and
dialog: it seemed like somethin' I was good
dialog: at so I...
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: No, I mean how would you do it? Do
dialog: you just sneak in real fast or hide
dialog: out till the store closes or what?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Naw, honey, that would be burglary.
dialog: I never got arrested for burglary.
dialog: Burglary's for chicken shits. If
dialog: you're gonna rob someone, ya just
dialog: have to go right on up to 'em and do
dialog: it. Just take the money. That's
dialog: robbery. That's a whole 'nother
dialog: deal.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Tell me.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Well, first you pick your place,
dialog: see, then I'd just sit back and watch
dialog: it for awhile. Ya gotta wait for
dialog: just the right moment, which is
dialog: something you know instinctively,
dialog: that can't be taught. Then I'd waltz
dialog: on in...
text: J.D. jumps up and picks up a hair dryer and holds it like a
text: gun. He starts acting it out.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: And I'd say, "Alright, ladies and
dialog: gentlemen, let's see who'll win the
dialog: prize for keepin' their cool. Simon
text: says everybody lie down on the floor.
dialog: If nobody loses their head, then
dialog: nobody loses their head. You sir...
dialog: You do the honors. Just empty that
dialog: cash into this bag and you'll have
dialog: an amazing story to tell all your
dialog: friends. If not, you'll have a tag
dialog: on your toe. You decide." Then I'd
dialog: split. Simple.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: My gosh, you sure gentlemanly about
dialog: it.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I've always believed if done right,
dialog: armed robbery doesn't have to be a
dialog: totally unpleasant experience.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: God. You're a real live outlaw!
dialog: J.D.
dialog: I may be the outlaw, but you're the
dialog: one stealin' my heart.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
text: They kiss passionately.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: You're kinda the best thing that's
dialog: happened to me in a long time.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You're a little angle, you are.

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Don't worry darlin'. I'll say I

speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill
dialog: that makes you say all the right

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'm choking on it.
text: They sit for a minute.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Honey? Ummm... Do you want me to
dialog: come with you?
text: They look at each other, into each other and Jimmy can see
text: that Louise is already gone. Louise is really touched that
dialog: he asked her that but she knows it's impossible. She is
dialog: very kind to him.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Oh... now... it's probably not such
dialog: a good idea right now. I'll... catch
dialog: up with you later, on down the road.
text: In her hand she's been holding the ring in the black box.
text: She puts it on the table and slides it back to him. He stops
text: her, suddenly. He covers her hand with his.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You keep this!
text: Jimmy is trying not to seem upset, so he's completely still.
text: A taxi pulls up outside.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Your taxi's here.
text: Jimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that
text: employees in the coffee shop look away. A cook fans himself
text: with a spatula. The taxi driver, who can see in, looks at
dialog: his watch.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Are you happy, Louise? I just want
dialog: you to be happy.
text: Louise looks at her hand and Jimmy's hand.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I'm happy, sweetie. Happy as I can
dialog: be.
text: Jimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop. Louise watches
text: him go. A WAITRESS comes over and fills her coffee cup.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Good thing he left when he did. We
dialog: thought we were gonna have to put
text: out a fire.
text: The Waitress chuckles and the other waitresses do too. Louise
text: waves to Jimmy in the back of the cab. The cab driver winks
text: at her. She smiles to herself.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

speaker_heading: HAL

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Do you think you could ever think of
dialog: a set of circumstances that would
dialog: just cause you to haul off and shoot
dialog: someone?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a
dialog: stranger?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don't know, honey. I guess it
dialog: would depend.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: On what?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (trying to picture it)
dialog: Well, maybe if they were trying to
dialog: hurt you or one of the kids. I'm
dialog: sure I could shoot someone if they
text: tried to hurt one of the children.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Yeah, I could too. But... I don't
dialog: know why I'm even asking you this.
dialog: It's just... we can't place anybody
text: at the scene but these two gals that
dialog: everybody swears is sweet as pie. I
dialog: don't know. I keep hearing words --
dialog: impossible -- inconceivable. If
dialog: just one person would say...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Honey. Nothing's impossible. You
dialog: just don't shoot someone like that
dialog: for no reason. Maybe he was askin'
dialog: for it. Anyway, somebody's husband
dialog: probably got ol' Harlan.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: That's what everybody says. Only
dialog: problem is nobody's husband was
dialog: unaccounted for that night... Could
dialog: you shoot Eddie in the face? At
dialog: point blank range?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (thinking)
text: In the leg.
speaker_heading: HAL

dialog: I gotta go to Little Rock.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

text: Her energy and volume is several notches higher than the
text: rest of the people in the coffee shop. There are a couple
text: more customers in there now. Thelma slides into the booth
text: seated directly across from Louise.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Hi.
text: She is shocked by Thelma's appearance.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What happened to your hair?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Nothing. It got messed up.
text: Louise is studying Thelma closely as Thelma squirms in her

speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Nothing. Why? Do I seem different?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Yes, now that you mention it. You
dialog: seem crazy. Like you're on drugs.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Well, I'm not on drugs. But I might
dialog: be crazy.
speaker_heading: LOUISE

speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Oh my God, Louise!!! I can't believe
dialog: it! I just really can't believe it!
dialog: I mean... whoa!

dialog: understands.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Oh, Thelma. Oh, no.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I mean I finally understand what all
dialog: the fuss is about. This is just a
dialog: whole 'nother ball game!
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.
dialog: You're making a spectacle.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: You know, Louise, you're supposed to
dialog: be my best friend. You could at
dialog: least be a little bit happy for me.
dialog: You could at least pretend to be
dialog: slightly happy that for once in my
dialog: life I have a sexual experience that
dialog: isn't completely disgusting.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I'm sorry. I am happy. I'm very
dialog: happy for you. I'm glad you had a

dialog: is he now?
speaker_heading: THELMA
text: Taking a shower.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: You left that guy alone in the room?

speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Where's the money, Thelma?
text: Thelma has forgotten all about the money.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Ummm... it's on the table. It's
dialog: okay.

speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I don't remember.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY
text: They run across the parking lot around the back to the room.
text: The door is ajar and no one is in the room. Louise goes in
text: and Thelma stays outside the door.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Goddamnit! I've never been lucky!
dialog: Not one time!
text: Louise comes back outside. She doesn't say anything. She
text: is stoic, fighting tears.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Shit. That little sonofabitch burgled
dialog: me. I don't believe it.
text: Louise sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room. Thelma
text: comes and sits beside her. Neither one says anything for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise? Are you okay?
text: Louise shakes her head no.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise... It's okay. Louise? I'm

text: Louise has seen the end of the tunnel and there is no light.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: It's not okay, Thelma. It's
dialog: definitely not okay. None of this

dialog: for money? What are we gonna buy
dialog: gas with? Our good looks? I mean...
dialog: Goddamn, Thelma!
text: Louise quietly starts to fall apart. This causes Thelma to
text: leap into action.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Come on. Stand up! Don't you worry
dialog: about it. I'll take care of it.
dialog: Just don't you worry about it. Get
dialog: your stuff.

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We're going to leave someone here at

speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: The important thing is not to let on
dialog: that you know anything. We want to

dialog: Now I don't want to get too personal,
dialog: but do you have a good relationship
dialog: with your wife? Are you close with

speaker_heading: DARRYL
dialog: Yeah, I guess. I mean, I'm about as

text: instead, throws it out the window, closes her eyes and leans

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: LOUISE

speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Isn't that nice? Truck drivers are

speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I want you to call Darryl.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: To find out if he knows anything.
dialog: If you think he does, you gotta hang

dialog: told him and the phone is probably
dialog: tapped.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You
dialog: think so?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: Oh, come on! Murder one and armed

speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Murder one! God, Louise, can't we
dialog: even say it was self-defense?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: But it wasn't! We got away! We
dialog: were walkin' away!
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: They don't know that! It was just
dialog: you and me there. I'll say he raped
dialog: me and you had to shoot him! I mean,
dialog: it's almost the truth!
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: It won't work.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Why not?!
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: No physical evidence. We can't prove
dialog: he did it. We probably can't even
dialog: prove he touched you by now.
text: They both pause for a moment.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: God. The law is some tricky shit,
dialog: isn't it?
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: How do you know 'bout all this stuff
dialog: anyway?
text: Louise does not answer the question.
speaker_heading: LOUISE

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Where did you get $6600.00 in cash?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: A friend.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: We spoke with a gentlemen today who
dialog: says he personally delivered very
dialog: close to that same amount to a Miss
dialog: Louise Sawyer. Do you know her too?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Umm, yes. She was driving.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: He said he took it to a motel in
dialog: Oklahoma City. He also says that at
dialog: that time he met a man. He identified
text: you through a series of mug shots.
dialog: He also told us that you and Mrs.
dialog: Dickinson seemed "close." Is that
dialog: true?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You might say we had a meeting of
dialog: the minds, yes.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Did you know that Mrs. Dickinson and
dialog: Miss Sawyer are wanted in connection
dialog: with a murder?
dialog: J.D.
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Did either of them ever indicate
dialog: that they might be running from the

dialog: J.D.
dialog: (surprised to hear

dialog: Now that you mention it, they might
dialog: have been a little bit jumpy.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You know what? You're starting to

speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Yeah. Me too.
text: Hal thinks for a moment and then looks to Max.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Do you mind if I have a word with

dialog: J.D.
dialog: What?! What'd I do?
text: Hal sits down across the table from J.D. and looks at him.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Son, I gotta feelin' about somethin'
dialog: and I just wanna ask your opinion.
dialog: Do you think Thelma Dickinson would
dialog: have committed armed robbery if you
dialog: hadn't taken all their money?
text: J.D. doesn't say anything. They both just sit there for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Cat got your tongue?
text: J.D. shifts in his chair.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: How do you know I took it? How do
dialog: you know they didn't just give it to

speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: There's two girls out there that had
dialog: a chance, they had a chance...! And
dialog: you blew it for 'em. Now they've
dialog: gotten in some serious trouble, some
dialog: very serious trouble and for at least
dialog: part of it, I'm gonna hold you
dialog: personally responsible for anything
dialog: that happens to them. I've got no
dialog: feelin' for you. But I may be the
dialog: only person in the world who gives a
dialog: rat's ass what happens to them and
dialog: you're either gonna tell me every
dialog: damn thing you know, so there's a
dialog: small chance I can actually do them
dialog: some good, or I'm gonna be all over
dialog: you like a fly on shit for the rest

dialog: is gonna be my goddamn mission in

text: Hal walks over and opens the door and Max and the others
text: straggle back in.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Now, for one thing, you violated
dialog: your parole two days out. And you
dialog: know Judge Hainey. He hates this

dialog: then when he finds out that you're a
dialog: possible accessory to murder and
dialog: armed robbery, well, I think we can
dialog: safely place your ass back in the

dialog: Just ignore him.
text: Louise passes him and, as she does, he HONKS. They look up
text: and he is wildly pointing to his lap.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Oh, Christ. I hate this guy.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: We should have just ignored him.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN (OVER MUSIC)
text: The car is flying down the road.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN
text: They are quiet for a moment, then Thelma starts quietly
text: laughing to herself. She is trying to stop but cannot.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (shaking with laughter)
dialog: Nothing. It's not funny.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What? What's not funny, Thelma!
text: Thelma is trying to compose herself but cannot.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Okay, but...
dialog: (she can barely speak)
dialog: I can't say.
text: Thelma isn't making a sound. She is stuck in a convulsion
text: of laughter.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (gasping for air)
dialog: Harlan.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What?! What about him?!
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Just the look on his face when you...
dialog: (she is falling apart
dialog: again)
dialog: ...it's not funny.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Now, Thelma, that is not...
text: Thelma is still trying to get a grip on herself.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (scolding)
dialog: Thelma!
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (impersonating Harlan)
dialog: Suck my dick... Boom!!
text: Thelma is laughing wildly.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Thelma. It's not funny.
text: Thelma has just crossed the line from laughing to crying.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (trying to catch her
dialog: breath)
dialog: I know!
text: They both get quiet.
text: Thelma leans back just watching Louise. She studies her as
text: if she's never really seen her before. All of a sudden a
text: look of shocked realization comes over Thelma's face.
text: She jerks upright and startles Louise.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: It happened to you... didn't it?
text: Louise knows what she is talking about. She becomes
text: immediately agitated.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I don't want to talk about it!
dialog: Thelma, I'm not kidding! Don't you
dialog: even...
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: ...in Texas... didn't it? That's
dialog: what happened... Oh my God.
text: Louise looks as if she is looking for a way to flee.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (fighting hysteria)
dialog: I'm warning you, Thelma. You better
dialog: drop it right now! I don't want to
dialog: talk about it!
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Okay, Louise... It's okay.
text: Louise's eyes are wild, not seeing, while Thelma now seems
text: completely serene.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN
text: The car is SCREAMING down the road. They drive through a
text: little stand of buildings.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - LONG LENS SHOT - DAWN
text: A car speeds up to try and catch them... The red and blue
text: lights pop on. It is a New Mexico State Patrol car.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Louise sees the lights in the rearview mirror. LOUISE'S POV
text: OF THE SPEEDOMETER at 100 mph. Thelma is asleep.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Shit! Thelma, wake up! Shit! We're
dialog: gettin' pulled over!
text: Thelma jumps awake.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: What! What! Oh shit! Oh no!
text: They are trying not to panic. They are slowing down, but
text: still doing 70 mph. The patrol car is right behind them.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: What do we do? What do you want to
dialog: do?!
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I don't know! Shit! Let's just
dialog: play it by ear. He may not know.
dialog: He may just give me a ticket.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Please, God, please don't let us get
dialog: caught. Please, please, please...
text: Louise pulls the car off the road. The patrol car pulls up
text: right behind them. The lights shine brightly in through the
dialog: windows.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Turn off your engine.
text: Louise does. The PATROLMAN gets out of his car and approaches
text: their car. He comes to the driver's side window. It is
text: rolled up.
text: PATROLMAN'S POV OF LOUISE smiling up at him. He gestures to
text: her to roll her window down. She does.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Hello, Officer. Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: You wanna let me see your license,
dialog: please?
text: Louise fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it and
text: shows her license.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: You wanna take it out of your wallet,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: She does and hands it to him.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I told you to slow down. Hell,
dialog: Officer, I told her to slow down.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: About how fast was I going?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: About a hundred and ten. You wanna
dialog: step out of the car, please?
text: They walk to the back of the car. He notes the license plate
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Is this your car?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: You wanna come with me, please?
text: Walk around and get in the car,
dialog: please.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: In the back?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Front.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Am I in trouble?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am,
dialog: you are.
text: Patrolman gets in the driver's side. He picks up a clipboard
text: and clips Louise's driver's license to it. He picks up the
text: hand mike for the radio and, as he does, a hand with a gun
text: comes in his car window. It's Thelma and she puts the gun
text: to his head.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Officer, I am so sorry about this.
dialog: Could you let go of that?
text: He drops it.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I really, really apologize, but please
dialog: put your hands on the steering wheel.
dialog: See, if you get on that radio, you're
dialog: gonna find out that we're wanted in
dialog: two states and probably considered
dialog: armed and dangerous, at least I am,
dialog: then our whole plan would be shot to
dialog: hell. Louise, take his gun.
text: Louise reaches over and takes his gun.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: I am really sorry about this.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: I swear, before yesterday, neither
dialog: one of us would have ever pulled a
dialog: stunt like this. But if you ever
dialog: met my husband, you'd know why I
dialog: just can... You wanna step out of
dialog: the car, please?
text: (she opens the door
dialog: for him)
dialog: You wanna put your hands on your
dialog: head, please? Louise, shoot the
dialog: radio.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Shoot the radio!
text: Louise SHOOTS the car radio. The cop flinches with each
dialog: shot.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: The police radio, Louise! Jesus!
text: Louise fires TWO SHOTS into the police radio. It BLASTS all
dialog: to hell.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: You wanna step to the back of the
dialog: car, please. Louise, bring the keys.
text: Louise reaches over and takes the keys. She takes her license
text: off the clipboard. She gets out and trots around to the
text: back of the car.
text: Thelma is holding the gun on the Patrolman. Suddenly Thelma
text: FIRES the gun, blowing two holes into the trunk cover.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (to Louise)
dialog: Open the trunk.
text: Louise opens the trunk.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (to Patrolman)
dialog: You wanna step into the trunk, please?
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Ma'am, please... I got kids... a
dialog: wife...
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: You do? Well, you're lucky. You be
dialog: sweet to 'em. Especially your wife.
dialog: My husband wasn't sweet to me and
dialog: look how I turned out. Now go on,
dialog: get in there.
text: As he's climbing into the trunk, Thelma explains to Louise:
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Air holes.
text: He's all the way in and Louise closes the trunk.
scene_heading: INT. PATROL CAR - DAY
text: Thelma opens the glove compartment. She takes a box of spare
text: ammo and closes it. Thelma takes the keys and gets out of
text: the car. She walks around to the trunk.
scene_heading: EXT. PATROL CAR - DAY
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (to trunk)
dialog: Sorry!
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: (from her car)
dialog: Sorry!
text: Thelma hops into the car with Louise. They look at each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Hit it.
text: Louise pulls the car back onto the road and they drive away.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: I know it's crazy, Louise, but I
dialog: just feel like I've got a knack for
dialog: this shit.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I believe you.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - MONTAGE DRIVING SHOTS - DAY
dialog: They are in really beautiful country now.
speaker_heading: THELMA (V.O.)
dialog: Drive like hell.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Hal and Max are alone in the kitchen. Hal switches on the
dialog: Mr. Coffee.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: It's just not working like this. We
dialog: gotta do something. It'd be one
dialog: thing if these girls were hardened
dialog: criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is
dialog: makin' us look bad. I don't know...
dialog: maybe they're not movin'. Maybe
dialog: that little creep lied.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.
dialog: Nothin' at all. He already got all
dialog: their money. I just don't know what
dialog: we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it
dialog: went out again last night on
dialog: Nationwide Teletype. Let's just
dialog: wait it out a little longer. She
dialog: said she was gonna call back. Let's
dialog: just sit tight.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: We don't have a whole lotta choice,
dialog: do we? I can't figure out if they're
dialog: real smart or just really, really
dialog: lucky.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: It don't matter. Brains will only
dialog: get you so far and luck always runs
dialog: out.
text: A cop walks into the kitchen and hands Hal a file that says
text: Louise Elizabeth Sawyer on the outside. He opens it up and
text: starts looking through a personal history. One piece of
dialog: paper is a case file from Texas containing an incident report
text: of a rape. Stamped across it are the words "charges dropped."
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Louise... are we still going to
dialog: Mexico?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Yes.
text: Thelma pauses while she searches for the logic.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Then aren't we going in the wrong
dialog: direction?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Well, I figure if you take a state
text: policeman, shoot up his car, take
text: his gun and lock him in the trunk,
dialog: it's best to just get on out of the
dialog: state if you can.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Just asking.
text: They are both quiet for a second. Louise goes a little
dialog: faster.
text: Thelma is digging through her bag. She hands Louise a piece
text: of beef jerky.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I don't want to see any more beef
dialog: jerky. I mean the next beef jerky
dialog: you hand me is going out the window.
dialog: It's drivin' me crazy. The whole
text: car smells like it.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: It's good. It's what the pioneers
dialog: ate.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I don't care what the damn pioneers
dialog: ate. You just keep that shit away
dialog: from me, now I mean it.
text: Thelma puts down her bag.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: And I don't want any more Wild Turkey,
dialog: either. It's burning a hole in my
dialog: stomach.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Okay, okay... I've got some tequila.
dialog: You want some tequila?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Yeah, you want it?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Thelma starts to dig through her bag again.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: It's in here somewhere.
text: Louise is rubbing her face. She looks pretty bad. Her hands
text: are shaking.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Shit. I'm gettin' tired.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Are you alright?
text: Louise does not really seem alright.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I think I've really fucked up. I
dialog: think I've got us in a situation
dialog: where we could both get killed. Why
dialog: didn't we just go straight to the
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: You know why. You already said.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What'd I say again?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Nobody would believe us. We'd still
dialog: get in trouble. We'd still have our
dialog: lives ruined. And you know what
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: That guy was hurtin' me. And if you
dialog: hadn't come out when you did, he'd a
dialog: hurt me a lot worse. And probably
dialog: nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause
dialog: everybody did see me dancin' with
dialog: him all night. And they woulda made
dialog: out like I asked for it. And my
dialog: life woulda been ruined a whole lot
dialog: worse than it is now. At least now
dialog: I'm havin' fun. And I'm not sorry
dialog: the son of a bitch is dead. I'm
dialog: only sorry that it was you that did
dialog: it and not me. And if I haven't, I
dialog: wanna take this time to thank you,
dialog: Louise. Thank you for savin' my
dialog: ass.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I said all that?
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: No, Louise, you said the first part.
dialog: I said all the rest.
speaker_heading: LOUISE

text: Hal smiles.
speaker_heading: HAL

speaker_heading: LOUISE (V.O.)
dialog: Well. You don't.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: You're gettin' in deeper every moment
dialog: you're gone.
speaker_heading: LOUISE (V.O.)
dialog: Would you believe me if I told you
dialog: this whole thing is an accident?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I do believe you. That's what I
dialog: want everybody to believe. Trouble
dialog: is, it doesn't look like an accident
dialog: and you're not here to tell me about
dialog: it... I need you to help me here.
scene_heading: EXT. PAY PHONE - MORNING
text: Louise does not answer.
speaker_heading: HAL (V.O.)

dialog: No!
speaker_heading: HAL (V.O.)
dialog: You want to come on in?
text: Louise thinks for a minute.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I don't think so.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Then I'm sorry. We're gonna have to
dialog: charge you with murder. Now, do you
dialog: want to come out of this alive?
text: The surveillance man motions to Hal to keep it going.
text: Darryl comes in and immediately realizes Hal is talking to
text: Louise. Darryl looks attentively at Hal.
scene_heading: EXT. PAY PHONE - DAY
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: You know, certain words and phrases
dialog: just keep floating through my mind,
dialog: things like incarceration, cavity
dialog: search, life imprisonment, death by
dialog: electrocution, that sort of thing.
dialog: So, come out alive? I don't know.
dialog: Let us think about that.
speaker_heading: HAL (V.O.)
dialog: Louise, I'll do anything. I know
dialog: what's makin' you run. I know what
dialog: happened to you in Texas.
text: Louise's eyes get wide as she hears this.
text: A FINGER reaches up and presses down the lever and hangs up
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: ANGLE OF THELMA
text: She has her finger on the lever.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Come on, Louise. Don't blow it.
dialog: Let's go.

speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: Come on.
text: Louise doesn't move.
scene_heading: INT. THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Frustrated, Hal slams down the phone. He looks over at the
text: surveillance man who nods to say "we got it." The whole
text: room reacts excitedly. Everyone in the room springs into
text: action. Max immediately picks up the phone and Hal watches
text: him intently. He mouths the words to Max -- "I wanna go"
text: emphatically. Max slightly shakes his head, still of the
text: phone. Hal goes charging over to Max.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Max. You gotta take me there! I'm...
dialog: I'm the only one she's ever talked
dialog: to. I don't want anybody losin'
dialog: their heads. You know what happens.

dialog: the next thing you know those girls

speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: No, Thelma. I'm not gonna make any

speaker_heading: THELMA

text: Louise is surprised to be hearing this from Thelma.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: Thelma, that is not an option.
speaker_heading: THELMA
dialog: But I don't know... something's
dialog: crossed over in me and I can't go
dialog: back. I mean, I just couldn't live...
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: I know. I know what you mean. I
dialog: don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo

speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: He said they're charging us with

speaker_heading: THELMA

dialog: Eeuww.
speaker_heading: LOUISE
dialog: And we have to decide whether we

text: Hal looks at Max.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Hey! Don't let them shoot those
dialog: girls. This is too much. They got
dialog: guns pointed at 'em!
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: The women are armed, Hal. This is
