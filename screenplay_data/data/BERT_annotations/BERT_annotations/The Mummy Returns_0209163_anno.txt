text: The Universal Pictures Globe DISSOLVES into a GOLD DISC,

text: at the top of a banner being carried by an AKKADIAN SOLDIER.
text: SIX THOUSAND AKKADIAN SOLDIERS march with him.
text: NINE THOUSAND SUMERIAN SOLDIERS are coming at them from
text: across the golden dunes. Behind the Sumerians is the massive
text: walled CITY OF THEBES: palaces, temples, needles, --the

speaker_heading: ARDETH BEY (0.s.)
dialog: Six thousand years ago, a fierce
dialog: warrior known as the Scorpion King,
dialog: led a great army on a campaign to
dialog: unite the known world.
text: A powerful FIST is thrust into FRAME, clenching a scimitar,
text: a GOLD BRACELET adorns the warrior’s wrist. Muscular, brutal
text: looking and heavily scarred, this is the SCORPION KING. The
text: spooky thing about him is that through a strange Akkadian
text: tribal ritual, all the skin on his head above his eyebrows
text: bas been removed, exposing his BLEACHED SKULLCAP. He BELLOWS
text: a command. He and his soldiers CHARGE FORWARD.
text: CUT WIDE: as both armies, fifteen thousand men strong, pour
text: over the golden dunes and CLASH. The Scorpion King fights
text: like a man possessed. Slowly being swallowed up in the dust.
speaker_heading: ARDETH BEY (0.8.)
text: The Scorpion King and his army
dialog: were finally defeated by the

speaker_heading: ARDETH BEY (0.s.)
dialog: For three months they wandered
text: the desert, slowly dying, until
dialog: the Scorpion King himself was
text: the last man left alive.
text: Alone in the middle of a vast wasteland, the Scorpion King
text: crawls on his hands and knees, then he looks up into the

text: The Scorpion King sees a live SCORPION crawling towards him.
text: He looks back up to the heavens and sneers, then grabs the

text: STINGS HIM. He shoves the scorpion into his mouth and chews.
speaker_heading: ARDETH BEY (0.8.)
dialog: He swore that if Anubis would spare
dialog: him, and let him conquer his enemies,
dialog: that he would give Anubis his soul,
dialog: and build him a great temple, —a
text: pyramid of gold.
text: Suddenly, in a circle around him, --LUSH GREEN VEGETATION
text: SPRINGS UP OUT OF THE SAND, then EXPLODES OUT EXPONENTIALLY
text: IN EVERY DIRECTION. SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREEN ARE THE WORDS:
text: THE OASIS OF AHM SHERE
text: And then a HUGE HOLE opens up in the ground in front of him.

scene_heading: EXT. ANCIENT THEBES COURTYARD — DAY

scene_heading: INT. EGYPTIAN TEMPLE — DAY
text: Inside the temple, dozens of GIANT PILLARS rise up from the
text: rock strewn floor to the cracked ceiling above. A shaft of
text: dusty sunlight shines in through a doorway. A small FIGURE
text: in a pith helmet enters, holding a TORCH. The Figure moves
text: through the pillars and enters a FISSURE in a far wall.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS — DAY
text: We follow the pith helmeted Figure as he slowly creeps
text: through spooky catacombs. The walls are covered in dark
text: hieroglyphics. A scary NOISE is heard. The Figure freezes,
text: then turns around and faces us: it’s an adorable little
text: eight-year-old boy. This is ALEXANDER O'CONNELL.
text: Alex looks around, eyes wide. It’s dark and quiet. And then a
text: HAND GRABS HIM. Alex SCREAMS. It’s O'CONNELL, looking dashing
text: and handsome and wearing a sleeveless shirt.
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: Alex, I told you to wait up in

speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Go. Away.
text: Her foot hooks the snake and tosses it across the room.
text: O'Connell comes through the door. Evy gestures.
speaker_heading: EvVY
dialog: Watch your head, honey.
speaker_heading: Q’CONNELL
dialog: It was just Alex.
text: Not listening, O’Connell SMACKS his head on a low hanging

speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Don’t sit there.
speaker_heading: O’CONNELL
dialog: He never listens.
text: Not listening, O’Connell sits on a rock covered in HOT COALS.
text: He YELPS and leaps up. Evy just smiles at hin.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: I wonder where he gets that from?
dialog: 
text: O'Connell gives her a forlorn look with his puppy dog eyes.
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: Why can't we have normal vacations

scene_heading: EXT. TEMPLE — DAY
text: FOUR EVIL LOOKING CHARACTERS ride up on horses and dismount,

scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE — DAY
text: Inside the temple, next to a large gathering of ancient
text: artifacts, Alex is building some sort of strange CONTRAPTION
text: out of bamboo shoots, mummy wrappings, and rotted bones.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No swords. No scimitars. No bows
dialog: and arrows. How's a kid supposed
dialog: to have any fun around here?
text: He's also keeping an eye on some RATS off in the corner.
text: Suddenly, VOICES are heard. Frightened, Alex looks around,
text: he spots a forty foot high WOODEN SCAFFOLDING. He quickly
text: scurries over and starts to climb up. At the top, Alex
text: bellycrawls across it and looks down over the other side:
text: Red, Spivey, Abdul, and Muhammad enter the temple, slow and
dialog: easy. Guns and scimitars up. Real professionals. A truly
text: vicious looking crew. Alex’s eyes widen in fear. Muhammad
text: heads for the fissure in the wall. Red turns to him.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Don’t light it until I yell at ya.
text: Muhammad nods and slips into the fissure. Spivey has been
text: staring at Alex’s contraption. Inside it, a piece of CHEESE
text: sits on a plate. Spivey grabs the cheese. The contraption
text: GOES CFF. A bamboo shoot SLAPS DOWN HARD onto Spivey’s hand,
text: --THWACK!! It’s a rat trap. We CUT AWAY on Spivey’s SCREAM.
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE MUMMY CHAMBER ~ DAY
text: WHAM! A huge slab hits the ground. Tarantulas and scorpions

dialog: ~all I’m sayin’ is maybe it’s

text: Evy gestures at the creepy, infested room, incredulous.
dialog: Evy
dialog: And give up all of this!?
text: Her hands whip through cobwebs, which stick to her fingers,

speaker_heading: O*’ CONNELL
dialog: Remind me again why you’ve been
dialog: so obsessed with coming here?
speaker_heading: EvY
dialog: Ever since I had that dream,
dialog: this place is all I can think
dialog: of. I feel like I've been here.
dialog: ~I know I've been here.
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: Evy, nobody’s been here, not
dialog: in over three thousand years.
text: Evy grabs a TORCH HOLDER on the wall and pulls it. A hidden
text: TRAP DOOR suddenly OPENS, revealing a secret passage.
speaker_heading: EvVY
dialog: Then how do I seem to know
dialog: exactly where I’m going?
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE - DAY
text: UP ON THE SCAFFOLDING: Alex quietly reaches back into his
text: rucksack and withdraws a wrist-rocket-style SLING SHOT.
text: DOWN BELOW: Red, Spivey, and Abdul are viciously ransacking
text: the artifacts, clearly looking for something.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: It ain’t ‘ere, dammit, it
dialog: ain’t ‘ere!
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: Maybe they ain’t found it yet.
text: A rock THWACKS Spivey in the head. He SCREAMS. Red and Abdul

speaker_heading: RED/ABDUL
dialog: What!? WHAT!?
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: Something hit me!
text: They all look around, suspicious.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMB — DAY
text: Muhammed creeps up to the~hole that O’Connell just created.
text: He pulls out several tightly wrapped STICKS OF DYNAMITE.
scene_heading: INT. PRIEST CHAMBER — DAY
text: O'Connell steps into a dark chamber.
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: -maybe it's your ancestors calling.
dialog: Yer half Egyptian, maybe it’s some
dialog: sorta Primal thing.
text: Evy sticks her torch into the room and pans it around. As the
text: torch passes in front of CAMERA the SCREEN FLASHES and we are
dialog: i four thousand years: The
text: room now looks gloriously new and utterly fantastic. On the
text: far wall, an EGYPTIAN PRINCESS comes out of a DOOR. We don’t
text: see her face, but we catch a glimpse inside the room: TWO
text: HUGE SPOOKY WARRIORS stand on either side of an ornate CHEST.
text: The Princess shuts the door and turns a SUNDIAL on it’s face:
text: twice to the right, once to the left, locking it. She starts
text: to leave. O'Connell walks through her. THE SCREEN FLASHES.
text: The chamber is ancient and dark once again. O’Connell steps
text: up to the door. He didn’t see any of it.
speaker_heading: O’ CONNELL
dialog: Allow me.
text: He slams the prybar into the door seam and starts prying.
text: Evy waves her torch around, trying to get that flashback
text: thing to happen again, looking a bit wigged-out. O’Connell
text: sees it in her eyes, he stops prying, concerned.
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: Another one of those.., visions?
text: ’ Evy quickly covers with a smile.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: It’s nothing, really.
speaker_heading: O’ CONNELL
dialog: What do you mean it’s nothing?
dialog: C’mon Evy, this’s been goin’
dialog: on for nine years.

speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Yes, ever since we left Hamunaptra.

dialog: 
text: O’Connell starts prying again, grunting and groaning.
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: It’s like goin’ there triggered
dialog: some ancient memories or somethin’.
text: Evy grabs the sundial; turns it twice to the right, once to
text: the left. The door opens. She gives O‘Connell a nervous look.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: I think perhaps the answer lies
text: on the other side of this door.
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE - DAY
text: Spivey bends over to look into a sack filled with trinkets.
text: UP ON THE SCAFFOLDING: Alex fires the SLING SHOT and ducks.
text: Spivey grabs his ass and leaps up SCREAMING.
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: OH MY GOD THAT HURT!
text: Again, Red and Abdul scan the temple suspiciously.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - DAY
text: Muhammad jimmys the sticks of dynamite into the wall.
scene_heading: INT. CHEST CHAMBER — DAY
text: Evy and O'Connell slowly creep into the chamber. Evy turns
text: to her left, --a SOLDIER MUMMY IS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO HER.
text: Evy SCREAMS and jumps back. O’Connell instantly leaps forward
text: and swings his pry bar, decapitating the mummified Soldier
text: Mummy. It’s head ricochets off the walls.
text: Evy steps up with her torch to reveal that there are actually
text: TWO Soldier Mummies, the same spooky warriors we saw in her
text: vision, now mummified, standing guard on either side of the
text: same ornate CHEST, now covered in spiderwebs. The GOLD DISC
text: from the first shot of the movie sits on top of the chest.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Oh my god, the Scorpion King.
speaker_heading: O’CONNELL
dialog: Bad guy?
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: The worst.
text: Evy kneels down and starts analyzing the chest.
dialog: Evy
dialog: But he’s always been considered
dialog: a myth. No trace of him has ever
dialog: been found, no artifacts, no writings...
text: O'Connell tries to get her pumped up.
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: This is the perfect cap to your
dialog: career. The final feather in
dialog: your hat! You'll be the toast
dialog: of the Bembridge Scholars! Now
dialog: we can finally settle down.
text: Evy gives him a withering look. O’Connell just sighs heavily.
speaker_heading: O’ CONNELL
dialog: Can't blame a guy for trying.
text: He SPITS into both of his palms for leverage and grabs the
text: pry bar. Evy grimaces.
speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: That’s attractive.
text: O’Connell SLAMS the pry bar into the seam of the chest.
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE — DAY
text: Alex FIRES the SLING SHOT. Abdul spins around and grabs the
text: rock right out of the air, THWAP! Two inches behind Spivey’s
text: head. AND he catches eyes with Alex before Alex can duck.
text: Abdul opens his fist. Spivey and Red see the rock in his
text: palm. Abdul closes his fist and crushes the rock to powder.
speaker_heading: ABDUL
dialog: I‘ll take care of this.
text: He pulls out his scimitar, -~-SHING! Alex’s eyes widen. He

speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: Ya know, we don’t always hafta
dialog: do things the easy way.
text: Evy opens the chest. Cradled inside it is the same thick GOLD
text: BRACELET we saw on the Scorpion King’s wrist. The bracelet is
text: Silosed tight.
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE — DAY
text: Abdul’s scimitar is clenched between his teeth as he climbs
text: up the scaffolding. Alex slowly backs down to the edge of it,
text: he looks around, there’s nowhere else to go. Abdul is almost
text: to the top. And that’s when Muhammad comes running in.
speaker_heading: MUHAMMAD
dialog: Gol GO! GO! The dynamite! It’s
dialog: going to blow!
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: What are you talkin’ ‘bout!?

dialog: It’s too late! It’s too late!
text: Abdul looks down to see his three buddies sprinting out of
text: the temple, he gives a quick look at the terrified little
text: boy, snarls at him, then slides all the way down to the
text: floor. At the bottom, Abdul kicks a balance board out from
text: under the scaffolding. The scaffolding immediately begins to
text: ROCK and SWAY. So does Alex. Abdul runs out of the temple.
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS — DAY

scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY — DAY

scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE — DAY

scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE - DAY
text: Alex hears a NOISE and looks up. The last pillar hasn’t

text: Alex hears a loud CLICK coming from INSIDE THE CHEST.
text: Surprised, he looks at it, then pulls the key out of his

text: UP IN THE BALCONY: O'Connell steps up close to Evy.
speaker_heading: O* CONNELL
dialog: Evy, the other day we were that

speaker_heading: EVY
dialog: Why would we buy a farm?
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: Died. We almost died.
speaker_heading: EvY

speaker_heading: EvY

speaker_heading: O*’ CONNELL

speaker_heading: O’CONNELL
dialog: When I first fell for you, I
dialog: wanted to hang up my guns right

dialog: Well, .the last one almost did.
text: And then something mystical happens around Alex: the area

text: UP ON THE BALCONY: O'Connell and Evy are oblivious to it.

text: And then Alex’s vision races down the Nile and across the
text: desert. Stopping at the TEMPLE OF KARNAC, circa 2000 B.C.,
text: then it dissipates and vanishes. Alex just stares at the
text: bracelet on his wrist, wide-eyed. Evy hugs O’Connell tight.
dialog: Evy
dialog: Wellll, the Bembridge Scholars
dialog: dave been begging me to run the
dialog: British Library.
text: She smiles. O'Connell grins. They start to kiss, gently.
text: Alex rattles his head, then frantically starts fumbling with
text: the bracelet, trying to get it off; there’s no clasp or hasp,
text: it almost looks fused shut. O’Connell starts down the stairs.
speaker_heading: O’ CONNELL
dialog: I'm going to run over to Jonathan's,
dialog: get my car back.

dialog: Alex! Behave yourself for a few

text: SLAMS the chest shut.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You bet!
text: Evy starts down the stairs. Alex picks up the chest, it’s
text: light, he quickly sets it down, keys it open, grabs a heavy
text: VASE off a table, shoves it into the chest and slams it shut
text: again. Evy rounds the bookcase and ruffles Alex’s hair.

speaker_heading: EVY

scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE — BELGRAVIA — DUSK

scene_heading: THE HIGH PRIEST
dialog: You took it from Hamunaptra. We

speaker_heading: NY
speaker_heading: HIGH PRIEST
dialog: It is exactly this long, made of

speaker_heading: JONATHAN
dialog: Could you be a trifle more specific?
text: The knife digs into Jonathan’s throat.
speaker_heading: JONATHAN
dialog: I lost it in a card game!!
speaker_heading: HIGH PRIEST
dialog: For your sake, I hope not.
text: Meela steps out of the shadows, dressed to the nines, gold

text: cheek with the other.
speaker_heading: MEELA
dialog: Hello.
text: Jonathan gets a little excited.
speaker_heading: JONATHAN
dialog: Well hello there.
text: Meela sets the box on a nightstand, then opens it and stares
text: inside. Her hand suddenly blurs into the box and pulis out a
text: poisonous ASP by the neck. Jonathan withers. Meela smiles.
speaker_heading: MEELA
dialog: Egyptian Asps are quite poisonous,
dialog: but the venom tends to work very
text: slowly, very painfully.
text: Meela and her asp head for Jonathan, the asp HISSES and

speaker_heading: JONATHAN

speaker_heading: JONATHAN

speaker_heading: MEELA
dialog: When did we make that arrangement?
text: She squeezes the asp’s neck. It’s jaws open, revealing sharp
text: fangs. Jonathan starts to SCREAM. And that’s when the door is
text: KICKED OPEN and O’Connell steps in. Meela, the High Priest
text: and all the Turbans spin around. O’Connell just nods.
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: Howdy.
text: There’s a tense moment as the bad guys try and decide what to
text: do. O’Connell sighs heavily, not really up for a fight.
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: Okay folks, knowing Jonathan,
dialog: I’m sure he deserves whatever

speaker_heading: JONATHAN

speaker_heading: O'CONNELL

speaker_heading: O’CONNELL
dialog: Nice Asp.
text: EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE: Turban #1 lets go of Jonathan and

text: Turban #2 pulls the knife away from Jonathan's neck. Jonathan

speaker_heading: JONATHAN
dialog: I.have to go to the bathroom.
speaker_heading: O'CONNELL
dialog: You can hold it.
speaker_heading: JONATHAN
dialog: No I can’t!
