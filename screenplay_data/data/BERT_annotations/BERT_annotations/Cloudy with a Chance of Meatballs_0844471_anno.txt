text: A HUGE SPARK shocks Flint!

text: Fint stops.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: No, why?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, all your technology stuff, it

speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: The ratbirds, yes, they escaped and

speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Please, I’m so close with this one.
dialog: I just have to hook it up to the
dialog: power station and give it more
dialog: power and it’1l work, and then you
dialog: can sell food in the shop, and then
dialog: everyone won’t have to eat sardines
dialog: anymore. It is going to be so

text: Tim removes Steve and DROPS him. Time to lay down the law.
speaker_heading: TIM

speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: FLINT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: It had been almost ten years since

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hello, Sam Sparks, I’m America.
dialog: It’s Swallow Falls degrees... and,
dialog: uh, let’s just go to the mayor.
text: She gestures to the mayor, who addresses the excited crowd.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Thank you and welcome national
dialog: television audience!
text: AT THE POWER STATION, we sees QUICK CUTS of Flint connecting
text: lots of jumper cables together on the electrical tower.
text: We PAN UP to the top of the electrical tower over scary
text: zapping coils to find Flint at the very top STRUGGLING to
text: connect one last cable -- and he’s ELECTROCUTED and falls to
dialog: the ground.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: YAHHH!!!
text: ON THE MAYOR.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: And now, here to cut the ceremonial
dialog: ribbon, Swallow Falls’ favorite
dialog: son, Baby Brent!
text: Brent walks on stage from behind a curtain and RIPS OFF his
text: tracksuit, revealing a DIAPER.
speaker_heading: MAYOR (CONT’D)
dialog: He’s still got it, folks!
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Yeah! Hahaha! I’m the best person
dialog: in the whole town!
text: The crowd APPLAUDS. He makes his SIGNATURE POSE, knocking
text: over a wagon of sardines, and the crowd goes nuts.
speaker_heading: BRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh-oh!
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 20.
text: BACK AT THE POWER STATION, we see run back to his machine.
text: He raises the jumper cables high, about to attach them...
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Food synthesis go!
text: ON EARL in the crowd with his WIFE and son CAL. Suddenly he
text: jolts to attention. He looks down.
speaker_heading: EARL
text: My chest hairs are tingling.
dialog: Something’s wrong.
text: Earl acrobatically flips away toward the power station.
text: ON THE MAYOR.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: So here it is, the attraction the
dialog: whole world has been waiting for--
dialog: SardineLand!
text: Brent cuts the ribbon with the giant scissors and the tarp
text: falls, revealing a small Sea World-like THEME PARK.
dialog: Applause.
text: ON THE ATTRACTIONS as each tarp falls.
speaker_heading: MAYOR (CONT’D)
dialog: With rides! And exhibits! And
dialog: featuring Shamo! The world’s
dialog: largest sardine, and his flaming
dialog: hoop of glory!
text: Amid a few rides and booths is SHAMO, a TINY FISH in a VERY
text: LARGE BOWL, with a ring of fire to jump through. Shamo does
text: not look excited about the ring of fire.
speaker_heading: MAYOR (CONT’D)
dialog: Those of you in the Splash Zone,
dialog: look out!
text: ON JOE TOWNE in the front row of the bleachers, where ONE
text: SEAT is marked “SPLASH ZONE.”
speaker_heading: JOE TOWNE
dialog: Yeah!
text: ON EARL, doing OVERZEALOUS ACTION COP POSES. He sees Flint
speaker_heading: and GASPS.
text: ON FLINT, who finally connects the cables to the machine.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 21.
speaker_heading: MACHINE
dialog: Cheeseburger.
text: It starts to power up and Flint looks excited.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Flint Lockwood!
text: Flint turns and sees Earl running.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Uh, just a second! I’m in the
dialog: middle of a yaaaaah!
text: A SPARK sends the machine SHOOTING off horizontally like a
text: missile, with Flint dragged behind it, hanging on to jumper
dialog: cables for dear life.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaghgh!
text: ON MANNY AND SAM, broadcasting, unaware of the danger.
speaker_heading: SAM (ON TV)
dialog: Well, looks like things in Swallow
dialog: Falls are sardine to get better.
dialog: For--
text: WHAM! The machine knocks Manny’s camera into Sam, Flint
text: flies over. The lens smooshes right up against her face.
text: She looks ridiculous.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
scene_heading: <*SMOOSHED FACE NOISES*>
scene_heading: INT. WNN STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
text: The Anchor looks at Sam’s smooshed face in shock.
speaker_heading: WNN ANCHOR
dialog: Aah!
scene_heading: EXT. SARDINE CIRCLE - DAY
text: Flint looks back as the machine rockets him away from Sam.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Aah, sorry!
text: The machine (and Flint) whips into Sardine Land, knocks
text: around out Shamo’s fish bowl scaffolding, and ricochets back.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 22.
text: And time SLOWS DOWN as the machine and Flint pass by Tim.
text: Tim SCOWLS. Oops.
text: Flint STRUGGLES to stop the machine by planting his feet,
text: waterskiing on his spray-on shoes, tearing up the sidewalk,
text: and is finally stopped by a STOP sign.
text: The machine breaks away from the jumper cables and shoots up,
text: disappearing into the sky. Flint looks up at the machine he
dialog: lost...
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: No... OOF!
text: And he’s tackled by Earl.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: You're under arrest, Flint
dialog: Lockwood. Thank goodness you only
dialog: caused minimal damage to
dialog: SardineLand.
text: But behind them, there’s a noise. They both look at Shamo’s
dialog: bowl scaffolding...
text: KRAAAAAAK! The scaffolding breaks, the fish bowl topples
text: over and SPLASHES its water everywhere but the Splash Zone.
speaker_heading: JOE TOWNE
dialog: Oh, come on!
text: The bowl starts to roll around the town like a giant wheel of
dialog: desruction.
text: ON THE SARDINE MUSEUM, which is SMASHED by the bowl.
text: ON THE VIRTUAL SARDINE EXPERIENCE. People lie down in it
text: like sardines as the lid is rolled up over them. The bowl
text: SMASHES into it.
text: ON THE MAYOR, as the bowl smashes into the stage and sends
text: him FLYING.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Aaaaggh!
text: ON SHAMO, screaming inside the bowl.
text: ON THE CROWD, fleeing.
text: ON BRENT, running with the giant ceremonial scissors.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 23.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: I really shouldn't be running with
dialog: these!
text: Flint and Steve RUN as the bowl bears down on them, but they
dialog: aren’t fast enough and give up -- only to be saved when the
text: lip of the bowl rolls over them, leaving them unharmed.
speaker_heading: BRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Run, run, run, jump, jump, run,
dialog: run, jump!
text: ON THE BOWL, as it continues on its path of destruction
text: through Sardine Circle and people run SCREAMING.
text: THE BOWL bounces through a parking lot, exploding a car which
text: propels the bowl up in the air and throws Shamo through the
text: flaming hoop and towards the ocean and freedom
speaker_heading: SHAMO
speaker_heading: (GURGLY) Yippee!
text: Then he’s immediately SNATCHED UP by a flying ratbird.
text: Then the bowl falls back to the ground, landing upside-down
text: on top of Flint and Steve, trapping them inside.
text: THROUGH THE GLASS BOWL, Flint sees all the destruction he
dialog: caused.
speaker_heading: FLINT
speaker_heading: (DEFEATED) Ay papi.
text: Everyone stares at Flint. The Mayor. Brent. Cal and Earl.
text: All incredibly angry.
speaker_heading: EARL
scene_heading: (MUFFLED THROUGH GLASS) Flint
dialog: Lockwood!
text: Then Flint sees a disappointed Tim. He looks at his dad,
text: full of regret. Everyone turns their back on Flint, last of
text: all, Tim. Flint hits his head against the glass in despair.
text: Then... CRAAAACK! It sends a crack up to the top of the bowl
text: and the whole thing shatters. Everyone turns and GASPS.
text: Flint and Steve stare at the crowd, then quickly run away.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKS - DAY
text: We find Flint, with Steve, hanging on the ladder at the end
text: of the docks, hiding underneath. He SIGHS.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 24.
text: He hears footsteps, and hides... It’s Sam, who walks to the
text: end of the dock and SIGHS. She tosses her microphone ANGRILY
text: into the water. Then she PLOPS down, and her heels kicks
text: Flint in the eyes.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh my gosh! I am so sorry. Are
dialog: you okay? I didn’t get a chance to--
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: It’s okay. It’s just pain.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sorry, I am not myself today. My
dialog: whole career was ruined by some
dialog: crazy jerk riding a homemade
dialog: rocket.
text: Flint looks away suspiciously.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait a minute. (THEN) What is
dialog: going on with your feet?
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Spray-on shoes. They don’t come
dialog: off.
text: She grabs his foot and yanks it toward her until he’s hanging
text: upside down.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Cool! This could solve the untied
dialog: shoes epidemic. What are they made
dialog: of, some kind of elastic bio-
dialog: polymer adhesive?
text: Music plays as Flint gets all dreamy.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: (SMITTEN) Yeah, exactly...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (SUDDENLY NERVOUS) I mean...
dialog: (GIGGLES) Wow, they’re shiny.
dialog: (THEN) I’m Sam.
text: She lets go of his foot and his head slams into the ladder
text: again, causing him to YELP.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 25.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: (IN LOVE) Flint.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Steve!
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (EXCITED AGAIN) Is that a monkey

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ha! Incredible!
text: Flint is just staring at her enchanted, DREAMY MUSIC
text: playing...we can barely make out Sam putting it all together.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (DISTORTED) Did you make all of
dialog: this stuff? (THEN, REALIZING) You
dialog: hit me with the rocket!
text: MUSIC STOPS. Flint’s caught.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: You kicked me in the face!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I said I was sorry!...
text: SPLAT. Some yellow goop lands on the ladder. Steve licks it.
text: Flint SNIFFS it and is about to taste when ZING! A PICKLE
text: SLICE lands in the water. Sam notices none of this.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh! Do you know how hard it is to
dialog: break into the weather game? I
dialog: spent my entire life building up to
dialog: that moment. You get one shot at
dialog: the show...
text: ZING! Behind Flint, something lands in a garbage can on the
text: docks, causing it to rattle. Flint gets up and walks to it.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
scene_heading: (REALIZING SOMETHING’S AMISS)
dialog: ..-And if you don’t make it, it’s
text: back to cleaning the barometers...
text: Flint looks into the garbage can. There’s a SLICE OF CHEESE
text: inside. He reaches for it.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 26.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Cheese?
text: Suddenly a ratbird appears from the shadows of the can,
text: startling Flint. It snatches the cheese and flies away.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Aaaah!
text: Flint starts to piece it together.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: But that could only mean...

speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: My machine works... It really

text: Sam overhears and approaches.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAYOR

speaker_heading: SAM (ON TV)

speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: EARL

speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Food weather.
speaker_heading: EARL

speaker_heading: MAYOR

speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Cheeseburgers from the sky, that’s

speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: FLINT
scene_heading: What? (AWKWARD LAUGHING)
scene_heading: INT. FLINT'S LAB - MOMENTS LATER
text: Flint shows Sam a diagram of the machine.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: So here's how it works: Water goes
text: in the top and food comes out the
dialog: bottom.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So when you shot it up into the
dialog: stratosphere, you figured it would
dialog: induce a molecular phase change of
text: the vapor from the cumulonimbus
dialog: layer?
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: That’s actually a really smart
dialog: observation.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (SUDDENLY NERVOUS) I mean, the
dialog: clouds probably have water in them,
dialog: which I guess is why you shot it up
text: there in the first place.
speaker_heading: FLINT
scene_heading: (SUDDENLY NERVOUS) Right, right.
dialog: That's why I did that...on purpose.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Right, yeah.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Right.

scene_heading: INT. FLINT'S LAB - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: FLINT
text: The machine uses a principal of

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So, pizza?

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Chicken wings?!
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Okay, well, just think about what
dialog: you're saying and if it’s a food,
dialog: then yes it can.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Baloney?
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: That is a food.
text: Sam gets a dreamy look in her eyes.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: FLINT
scene_heading: (FLIRTS BADLY) Do you like Jell-0?
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, no, no. I am severely allergic

speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: (LYING) Yeah, me too!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So what’s it called?
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Peanut allergy.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Nothing. (THEN) To the computer!
text: Flint types the food code into the computer.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So, you're sure this is safe?
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Don’t worry. I have a Dangeometer

text: As Flint and Tim sit down at their table, Tim notices the
dialog: absence of any ceiling.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: So, no roof?
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Yup. You just hold out your plate.
dialog: And I even made it rain your
dialog: favorite: meat. Mmmmm.
text: Tim looks around the room as -- CLANK, CLANK, CLANK -- large
text: steaks hit the tables all around them, rattling silverware.
text: Everyone else enjoys it, but Tim is a bit freaked out.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. So, you know how the grand
dialog: reopening of the town is tomorrow?
dialog: Well, the mayor has asked me to cut
dialog: the ribbon. He said my invention
dialog: saved the town! Aren’t you proud
dialog: of me?"
text: Tim looks torn. Then-- SLAM! A large steak lands Tim’s
text: plate, STARTLING him. He looks down at it. He looks at
text: Flint, who’s still celebrating, arms in the air, and doesn’t
text: want to have to burst Flint’s balloon.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well... Doesn’t this steak look a
dialog: little big to you?
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Yeah, it’s a big steak. Every
dialog: steak is not exactly the same size.
dialog: Did you even hear what I just said?
text: WHAM! Another big steak lands between them, knocking their
text: glassware off the table.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Son, look around. I’m not sure
dialog: this is good for people. Maybe you
dialog: should think about turning this
dialog: thing off.
speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)

dialog: to get me to work in some boring
dialog: tackle shop?
text: Flint gets HIT by a steak.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Well, you seem like you know what
dialog: you're doing, then. I guess I'll
dialog: just get out of your way.
text: Tim heads off. The steak falls off Flint’s head.
scene_heading: EXT. TIM’S TACKLESHOP - LATER
text: CLOSE ON a fish being ground up into chum.
text: REVEAL Tim, alone, working the chum grinder. He pauses to
text: SIGH, then continues grinding.
scene_heading: EXT. TIM’S TACKLESHOP - SAME
text: Hot dogs rain down. One hits the “And Son” Tim tacked onto
text: the tackle shop sign and knocks it to the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EVENING
text: Flint walks down the street, muttering.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: There’s no pleasing that guy. He
dialog: just wants to take anything good I
dialog: do and just smoosh it-- Aaaah!
text: A THREE-FOOT LONG HOT DOG plops down in front of Flint. He
text: looks around to see several other large hotdogs around his
text: neighborhood, including his dad’s yard, which is full of
dialog: hotdogs.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: These are big hotdogs.
text: He looks up to the clouds, grave.
scene_heading: INT. FLINT’S LAB - MOMENTS LATER

text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 59.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Oh, man. (DEEP BREATH) I mean, this
dialog: isn’t that bad, is it, Steve?
text: Steve has smeared mustard on his face and hands.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yellow.
text: Flint goes over to the Dangometer which is in the yellow.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: You're right, Steve. The
dialog: Dangometer is in the yellow. I
dialog: don’t know what to do.
text: He hears a WHIRRING SOUND and turns to see...
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: I do... declare these hot dogs to
dialog: be delicious!
text: The Mayor, now GROTESQUELY FAT, riding in from the shadows on
text: a RASCAL SCOOTER and munching on a HOT DOG piled with FOOD.
speaker_heading: FLINT
scene_heading: (FREAKED OUT SOUND)
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Whoa.
text: Steve runs away.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: How did you get in here?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Tomorrow’s the big day, Flint. The
text: entire town’s fate is resting on
dialog: your food-weather! I’m thinking
dialog: pasta. Some light apps. I know
dialog: you won’t let us down.
text: He wheels back into the shadows, still staring at him.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Well, Mr. Mayor, I think there’s
dialog: something you should see.
text: The mayor returns.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: What?
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 60.
text: Flint leads the mayor over to the scanner, and pulls up a
text: display on the computer monitor.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: This is the molecular structure of
dialog: a hot dog that fell last week. And
dialog: this is the molecular structure of
text: a hot dog that fell today.
text: He pushes a button, revealing a very scary looking rapidly
text: moving group of molecules.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: The machine uses microwave
dialog: radiation to mutate the genetic
dialog: recipe of the food. The more we
dialog: ask it to make, the more clouds it
dialog: takes in, the more radiation it
dialog: emits, the more these food
dialog: molecules could over-mutate. I
dialog: think that’s why the food is
dialog: getting bigger.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Here’s what I heard: blah blah
dialog: blah, science science science
dialog: bigger. And bigger is better.
dialog: Everyone’s gonna love these new
dialog: portion sizes.
text: He shoves the entire hot dog in his mouth and swallows it.
speaker_heading: MAYOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (MOUTH FULL) I know I do.
text: Flint looks over to the button, unsure.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: My dad thinks I should turn it
dialog: off...
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Geniuses like us are never
text: understood by their fathers, Flint.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: But what if things go--
text: The Mayor starts circling FLint.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Who needs the approval of one

speaker_heading: MAYOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Not to mention that little cutlet
dialog: Sam Sparks... and me? I’ve always
dialog: felt you were like a son to me,
dialog: Flint. And I’m going to be so
dialog: proud of you tomorrow when you cut
dialog: that ribbon, save the town, and
dialog: prove to everybody what a great
dialog: inventor you are. So here’s the
dialog: cheese: You can keep it going, get
dialog: everything you’ve ever wanted, and
dialog: be the great man I know you can be.
dialog: Or, you can turn it off, ruin
dialog: everything, and no one will ever
dialog: like you. It’s your choice...
text: Tight on Flint’s eyes thinks about this. The word ‘choice’
text: echoes in his mind -- except not really, as we reveal:
speaker_heading: MAYOR (CONT’D)
dialog: (WHISPERING) Choice, choice,
dialog: choice...
dialog: Then--
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: (DEEP BREATH) Okay...
text: IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MONITOR: Flint approaches, and the
text: Mayor looks over Flint’s shoulder creepily.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, bigger is better, right?
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: Flint SLAPS the BUTTON. BOOM! We go from the SATELLITE DISH
dialog: up to the--
scene_heading: EXT. STRATOSPHERE - NIGHT
text: The machine, with some food caked-on itself, rattles as the

scene_heading: EXT. CHEWANDSWALLOW

speaker_heading: CROWDSPERSON #1

speaker_heading: CROWDSPERSON #2

scene_heading: INT. NEWSVAN - DAY
text: Sam's alone in the back studying herself in the mirror. She
text: takes her glasses on and off, on and off...
text: SAM’S POV: as she puts her glasses on, the shot gets
text: FOCUSED, and we can see what’s behind her.
text: With her newfound vision, she sees an old-fashioned SUITCASE
text: LAPTOP in the corner.
text: She blows off dust to see it reads “Doppler Weather Radar
dialog: 2000 Turbo.”
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Whoa.
text: Sam flops it on the table, opens it with awe, and pushes
text: START. It begins to boot up and she smiles. She can see her
text: reflection there in the screen, and she finally likes what
text: she sees. Then a weather image loads up.
text: On Sam, who adjusts some knobs and BEEP BEEP BEEP. We see a

scene_heading: EXT. CHEWANDSWALLOW - DAY

speaker_heading: MAYOR (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Flint you need to look at this.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Why aren’t you on TV? You’re

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There’s a problem. I think the

speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: MAYOR (0.S.)
dialog: And without further ado, our town’s

text: Flint runs out to grand APPLAUSE. He soaks it in.
speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Yeah! Flint! / Sign my shrimp! /

scene_heading: EXT. CHEWANDSWALLOW - SAME
text: Flint closes his eyes as he cuts the ribbon. Suddenly, a

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Danger! Danger! Danger!
text: Steve runs off. The wind picks up. Flint SNEEZES. Then
text: everyone SNEEZES. Flint TASTES THE AIR.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Salt and pepper wind...?
text: SMACK! Flint is HIT by a giant DRY LEAF. He SNIFFS it.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: (OH NO) Oregano.

speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Mamma Mia!
text: He turns back to Sam, who gives him an angry glare then runs

speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam, wait, no! I can turn it off!

speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: (DETERMINED) I can turn it off...

dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, kids, it’s all gonna be okay--
dialog: Oh, no.

text: Flint runs in the air past a MAN IN A TUB...
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Pardon me...
speaker_heading: MAN IN TUB
dialog: Pardon me!
text: ...then reaches Joe Towne, sitting in his car as it floats

text: door, climbs through, and exits the other side of the car,
text: still flying.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: JOE TOWNE
dialog: Aw, no problem.
text: He flies out of the twister and LOSES HIS LAB COAT...
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: No!

text: stop signs, mailboxes, a stepladder) as though they were

speaker_heading: MAYOR

speaker_heading: FLINT

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: FLINT

scene_heading: the plane. (GRABS CAN OF SPRAY-ON

speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Ladies first? No? Alright.
text: Flint, then Sam (still clutching the Doppler) LEAP out into

speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Wait for me!

speaker_heading: BRENT (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (STRUGGLING) I’m good.

dialog: No. Like, like you like you.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Me too. But about you.
text: He BITES the licorice rope, falling into the blackness.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Goodbye, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Flint! No!
text: Sam stumbles backwards and falls. Chickens swarm her, until
dialog: Brent arrives!
text: He tosses her onto his back and races out through the tunnel,
text: bowling over the other chickens.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Hang on, Sam! Dr. Manny’s got the
dialog: medicine for your face!
scene_heading: INT. FOOD ASTEROID, FOOD CAVE - DAY
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Aaaaahhh!
text: Flint LANDS, pulls himself up and discovers he’s in an
text: enormous food cavern.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 94.
text: At the center is the FLDSNDMFR, in a uvula-like column of
text: gelatin, above an undulating pit. The machine “inhales” a
text: bunch of clouds and releases a mass of black smoke down the
dialog: pit.
speaker_heading: MACHINE VOICE
speaker_heading: (FOOD WALLA)
scene_heading: INT. FOOD ASTEROID, FOOD TUNNEL - DAY
text: Brent PANTS as he gallops down the food tunnel with Sam on
text: his back, chased by chickens.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (GROGGY) Manny, we’re on our way,
dialog: hurry...
speaker_heading: MANNY (V.O.)
dialog: Hang on, Sam, I’m circling the
dialog: blowhole.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY/INT. CAR-PLANE - DAY
text: Manny adeptly steers. THUNK, THUNK -- something hits the
text: underside of the wings.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Was is das?
text: Steve jumps up onto Manny’s face, then hides under the seat.
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: Scared.
text: On the wing, large GUMMI BEARS pull themselves up and tear
text: the wing apart. The plane plummets.
text: Terrified, Steve slowly raises his head and looks out the
text: window. His eyes open wide in shocked glee.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT’D)
dialog: Gummi bears!
scene_heading: STEVE’S DREAM SEQUENCE:
speaker_heading: GUMMI BEARS
dialog: Play with us, play with us / Eat
dialog: us, eat us.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 95.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE:
text: Steve leaps out onto the wing, DEVOURING the gummi bears and
text: RIPPING APART their cute Gummi bodies. Heads and limbs fly.
scene_heading: FALLING GUMMI BEAR
speaker_heading: (SCREAMS )
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: Steve. HUNGRY! HUNGRY! GUMMI
speaker_heading: BEARS!
text: But the plane is still in a tailspin!
scene_heading: INT. FOOD ASTEROID, FOOD TUNNEL - DAY
text: Brent reaches the end of the tunnel and pauses. There’s no
text: sign of Manny.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Ohhhh, Manny where are you?!
text: ON STEVE, who rips out the heart of the last Gummi Bear and
dialog: eats it.
text: ON BRENT, looking back FEARFULLY as the chickens close in.
text: With no choice, he leaps out of the blowhole into mid-air,
text: SCREAMING as he plummets...
text: But Manny flies in at the last second and Brent SLAMS into
text: the windshield.
scene_heading: INT. CAR-PLANE/EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS
text: Brent lowers Sam into the plane.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Uuuugh. Oh, boy...
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: She touched a peanut or something!
scene_heading: INT. FOOD ASTEROID, FOOD CAVE - DAY
text: Flint makes his way toward the machine, HUMMING HIS
text: SOUNDTRACK and moving like a kid pretending to be an action
text: hero. He accidentally steps on a tortilla chip, CRUNCH,
text: alerting the machine to his presence.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 96.
text: Immediately the top half of the uvula lifts the FLDSMDFR up
text: and it fires a GIANT CORN at Flint.
speaker_heading: MACHINE VOICE
dialog: Corn.
text: The corn rips into the ground in front of him, digging a huge
text: crater in the spot where Flint was just standing.
text: The machine noses forward, still attached to the uvula, and
text: uses a beam of light to scan the room for Flint -- he’s
dialog: nowhere to be found.
text: The light beam passes over a row of food embedded in one of
text: the walls -- strawberries, hot dogs, pickles -- nothing.
dialog: Except -- that’s not a hot dog, it’s Flint in a bun!
text: But the machine doesn’t see him, and the uvula returns it to
text: the gelatinous column to continue pumping food around the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: MACHINE VOICE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (FOOD WALLA)
text: Flint slips out of the bun and inside a cocktail olive and
text: runs over to a corner. He grabs items as he goes -- a strand
text: of spaghetti, a shrimp -- and ties them tightly together...
speaker_heading: FLINT
text: Grabbing. Tying. Throwing.
text: ...then tosses the end with the shrimp through the hole of a
text: donut hanging from the ceiling and the tail of the shrimp
dialog: hooks in.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Waiting...
speaker_heading: MACHINE VOICE
speaker_heading: (FOOD WALLA)
text: Flint times it so the machine has just “exhaled,” then swings
text: out on the spaghetti strand...
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Swinging!
text: ..-wrapping it around the uvula like a tetherball so that the
dialog: machine can’t suck in any clouds.
text: Flint lands right next to the machine and immediately pulls
text: out his cell phone with the kill code.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 97.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry old friend. The kitchen’s
dialog: closed!
text: He jams the phone into the machine’s port. But instead of
text: the kill code, it turns out Tim sent him the CAT DJ VIDEO.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad, no...
text: Suddenly the uvula rears up, snapping the spaghetti, lifting
text: the FLDSMDFR, and Flint has to hang on for dear life as the
text: machine becomes a bucking bronco, flailing wildly and
text: shooting food in all directions.
text: Flint slips, barely holding onto one of the legs of the
text: machine as he dangles above the huge pit.
text: The FLDSMDFR sucks in clouds until the uvula looks like a
text: giant balloon filling the most of the cave, and prepares to
text: unload on Flint.
text: He looks down at the hole and notices his feet, still covered
text: -- at always -- in the indestructible Spray-On Shoes. His
text: eyes go WIDE.
text: Flint pulls out his can of SPRAY-ON SHOES...
speaker_heading: MACHINE VOICE
speaker_heading: (FOOD WALLA)
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: When it rains, you put on a coat.
dialog: Of spray-on shoes!!! Yeah!
text: ...and SPRAYS the Chow Plopper, SEALING IT SHUT FOREVER. The
text: machine bursts at the seams.
text: Flint looks up at the machine and steels himself...t hen LETS
text: GO and falls down through the food hole, out the column of
text: black smoke as the machine explodes... BOOM! The explosion
text: expands outward, following Flint down the hole. It gets
text: closer and closer until it overtakes him.
scene_heading: INT. CAR-PLANE - DAY
speaker_heading: SAM (0.S.)
dialog: (GROGGY) What’s happening...
dialog: Chickens...
text: Manny grabs an EPI PEN and jams it into Sam’s leg and she
text: wakes up with a start! Her swelling instantly goes down.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 98.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Where’s Flint?
text: As they streak towards us, the meateroid EXPLODES!
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: NOO000000000! ! !
text: Brent consoles Sam with a sticky, chickeny hug.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: I know, kid. I know.
scene_heading: EXT. AROUND THE WORLD - DAY
text: Paris, London, New York -- a RIPPLE of explosive energy
dialog: clears the skies. Everyone CHEERS!
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
text: Everyone on the boats watches the explosion clear the sky.
text: Tim climbs out unharmed from the Port-A-Potty. He looks up
text: at the sky and watches, hopeful, as the car-plane approaches.
scene_heading: EXT. CHEWANDSWALLOW - LATER
text: The breadboats return to shore as the car-plane lands. The
text: island is covered with giant food.
text: Manny, Steve, Chicken Brent and Sam emerge to CHEERS. Then
text: Sam closes the door to the plane. Tim approaches Sam.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Flint?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (HANGS HEAD) I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Oh...
text: Tim’s face falls. He starts to tear up. Sam puts her hand
text: on Tim’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Your son was a great man.
text: Behind them, a FLOCK OF RATBIRDS flies down from the sky.
text: The crowd points and GASPS.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 99.
text: Sam and Tim turn to see ratbirds gently place a smoking,
text: woozy Flint on the ground. Flint gives the ratbirds a thumbs-
text: up. They SQUAWK their approval. Everyone runs over to HUG
dialog: our hero.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Steve!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Steve!
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Flint!
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Brent!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Flint!
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Cal!
speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Flint!
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Earl!
speaker_heading: MACARONI GUY
speaker_heading: (MUFFLED) Flint!
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: You... guy!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Steve.
text: Then Sam approaches.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Flint.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Sam.
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 100.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Flint.
text: They look into each other’s eyes. Tim approaches.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Flint.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Dad.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (AWKWARD) Flint... oh. When you...
dialog: when you cast your line... if it’s
dialog: not straight... you, umm...
text: Father and son stand there awkwardly. Beat.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, for crying out loud.
text: Sam tears off Steve’s THOUGHT TRANSLATOR and puts it on Tim.
text: Suddenly the box allows him to gush his true feelings.
speaker_heading: TIM (THROUGH TRANSLATOR)
dialog: I’m proud of you, Flint. I’m
dialog: amazed that someone as ordinary as
dialog: me could be the father of someone
dialog: as extraordinary as you. You’re
dialog: talented, you’re a total original
dialog: and your lab is breathtaking. Your
dialog: mom, she always knew you were going
dialog: to be special and if she were alive
dialog: today, she’d tell us both, “I told
dialog: you so.” Now, look, when I take
dialog: this thing off and you hear me make
dialog: a fishing metaphor, just know that
dialog: fishing metaphor means... (SPOKEN)
dialog: I love my son.
text: Flint hugs his dad. He’s never been happier. The crowd
speaker_heading: CHEEERS.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: I love you, too, Dad.
text: Tim nudges Flint over to Sam. Flint turns to her.
speaker_heading: FLINT (CONT'D)
dialog: So where were we...?
text: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 101.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You were about to kiss me.
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Were you going to kiss me back?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why don’t you find out?
speaker_heading: FLINT
dialog: Because I don’t want to go for it
dialog: and then get shut down again.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Just kiss me!
text: She closes her eyes and leans in, puffing her cheeks out in
text: the same never-kissed-anyone face Flint made earlier. Flint
text: makes the same face and goes for it. It’s the most awkward,
text: nerdiest, and somehow still immensely satisfying on-screen
dialog: kiss ever.
text: ON FLINT AND SAM, KISSING.
text: As we begin a huge cinematic PULL OUT, we hear...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: That’s my son.
speaker_heading: BRENT
dialog: Yeah! I’m a chicken!
text: We pull back through the same clouds that led us into the
text: movie, and ratbirds fly by, WIPING to
speaker_heading: THE END
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
text: The Mayor bobs on what’s left of his mostly-eaten boat,
text: completely alone in the open ocean...
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: This was not well thought out.
text: He takes another bite, resigned.
