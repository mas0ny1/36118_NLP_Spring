scene_heading: SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE
dialog: by Marc Norman &amp; Tom Stoppard
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.
text: SKY. Over which a title "LONDON--SUMMER 1593" appears.
dialog: Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre
text: two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and
text: audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre,
text: home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage.
dialog: Across the river was the competition, built by Philip
dialog: Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem...
dialog: ...The Rose...
text: Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three-
text: tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor,
text: roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It
dialog: says:
scene_heading: SEPT. 7TH &amp; 8TH AT NOON
text: MR. EDWARD ALLEYN AND THE ADMIRAL'S MEN AT THE ROSE
scene_heading: THEATRE, BANKSIDE
scene_heading: THE LAMENTABLE TRAGEDIE OF THE MONEYLENDER REVENG'D
text: OVER THIS the screams of a man under torture. The screams
text: are coming from the curtained stage.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You Mongrel! Why do you howl When it
dialog: is I who am bitten?
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: The theatre owner, PHILLIP HENSLOWE, is the man
text: screaming. HENSLOWE'S boots are on fire. He is pinioned
text: in a chair, with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of
text: a fire burning in a brazier. He is being held in that
text: position by LAMBERT, who is a thug employed by FENNYMAN,
text: who is the owner of the VOICE. The fourth man, FREES, is
text: FENNYMAN'S bookkeeper.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: What am I, Mr. Lambert?
speaker_heading: LAMBERT
dialog: Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?
speaker_heading: FREES
dialog: Twelve pounds, one shilling and four
dialog: pence, Mr. Fennyman, including
dialog: interest.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Aaagh! I can pay you!
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh!
dialog: For pity's sake.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Take his feet out. Where will you get
speaker_heading: FREES
dialog: (the mathematical genius with
dialog: a notebook)
dialog: Sixteen pounds, five shillings and
dialog: nine pence
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: including interest in three weeks?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: I have a wonderful new play!
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
text: Put his feet in.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: It's a comedy.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
text: Cut his nose off.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: And his ears.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: And a share. We will be partners, Mr.
dialog: Fennyman!
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: (hesitating)
dialog: Partners!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken
text: identities, a shipwreck, a pirate
dialog: king, a bit with a dog, and love
text: triumphant.
speaker_heading: LAMBERT
dialog: I think I've seen it. I didn't like
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
text: This time it is by Shakespeare.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: What's the title?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
text: Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Good title.
text: FENNYMAN snaps his fingers at FREES and LAMBERT. LAMBERT
text: unties HENSLOWE, FREES starts writing a contract.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: A play takes time. Find actors
dialog: rehearsalslet's say open in three
dialog: weeks. That's--what--five hundred
text: groundlings at tuppence each, in
dialog: addition four hundred groundlings
dialog: tuppence each, in addition four
dialog: hundred backsides at three pence--a
dialog: penny extra for a cushion, call it two
dialog: hundred cushions, say two performance
dialog: for safety how much is that Mr. Frees?
speaker_heading: FREES
dialog: Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr.
dialog: Fennyman.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Correct!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: But I have to pay the actors and the
dialog: authors.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: A share of the profits.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: There's never any
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Of course not!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit
dialog: on something.
text: FENNYMAN slaps a contract down on the table next to n ink-
text: pot and quill.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Sign here.
text: HENSLOWE takes the quill and signs.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's
dialog: DaughterAlmost finished?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
text: Without doubt he is completing it at
dialog: this very moment.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY
text: A small cramped space in the eaves of a building. A
text: cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged
dialog: between crumpled pieces of paper. Among those we have
text: time to observe: a skull, a mug that says A PRESENT FROM
scene_heading: STRATFORD-UPON-AVON.
text: At infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper
text: are tossed towards the shelf. The man who is throwing
text: them, WILL SHAKESPEARE, is bent over a table, writing
text: studiously with a quill.
text: Now we see what he is writing: Will is practising his
text: signature, over and over again. "Will ShagsbeardW
dialog: ShakspurWilliam Shasper" Each time he is dissatisfied,
text: and each time he crumples, and tosses it away.
text: Suddenly WILL becomes impatient. He jumps up and goes to
text: the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts
text: to pull on his boots. At this point the door opens and
text: HENSLOWE walks in. He is out of breath and his feet hurt.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Will! Where is my play? Tell me you
dialog: have it nearly done! Tell me you have
dialog: it started.
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: You have begun?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (struggling with his boots)
dialog: Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt
dialog: that the sun doth move
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: No, no, we haven't the time. Talk
dialog: prose. Where is my play?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: (tapping his forehead and
dialog: heading out the door)
dialog: It is all locked safe in here
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: God be praised!
dialog: (then doubt)
dialog: Locked?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: As soon as I have found my muse
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.
text: WILL lives in a crowded area of the city. Hawkers are
text: crying their wares, tract-sellers, delivery boys, and
text: merchants go about their business. HENSLOWE catches up
text: with WILL as he strides purposefully along.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (catching up)
dialog: Who is she this time?!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: She is always Aphrodite.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
text: Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind
dialog: the Dog and Trumpet?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Henslowe, you have no soul so how can
dialog: you understand the emptiness that
dialog: seeks a soulmate?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Well, I am a dead man and buggered to
dialog: boot. My theatre is close by the
dialog: plague these twelve weeks, my company
dialog: is playing the inn-yards
dialog: of England, while Burbage and the
text: Chamberlain's Men are invited to court
dialog: and receive ten pounds to play your
dialog: piece, written for my theatre, by my
dialog: writer, at my risk when you were green
dialog: and grateful -
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What piece? Richard Crookback?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: No--it's comedy they want, Will!
dialog: Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Who wrote that?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Nobody! You are writing it for me! I
dialog: gave you three pounds a month since.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Half what you owed me. I am still due
dialog: for One Gentleman of Verona.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER STREET. DAY
text: HENSLOWE'S hardly paused in his appeal.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: . . . Will! What is money to you and
dialog: me? I, your patron, you my wordwright!
dialog: When the plague lifts Burbage will
dialog: have a new Christopher Marlowe for the
dialog: Curtain and I have nothing for the
dialog: Rose.
text: WILL stops.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty
dialog: pounds?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (staggered)
dialog: Fifty pounds? What for?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Burbage offers me a partnership in the
dialog: Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my
dialog: hired player days are over.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to
dialog: the dogs!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (answering for him)
dialog: No, then.
text: WILL turns down a side street.
scene_heading: EXT. MARKETPLACE. DAY.
text: HENSLOWE and WILL are crossing a crowded marketplace
text: where a Puritan preacher, MAKEPEACE, is haranguing anyone
dialog: who will listen.
speaker_heading: MAKEPEACE
dialog: and the Lord shall smite them! Yea,
dialog: harken to me. The theatres are
dialog: handmaidens of the devil! Under the
dialog: name of the Curtain, the players
dialog: breed lewdness in your wives,
dialog: rebellion in your servants, idleness
dialog: in your apprentices and wickedness in
dialog: your children! And the Rose smells
dialog: thusly rank by any name! I say a
dialog: plague on both their houses!
text: As he passes WILL gratefully makes a mental note.
scene_heading: EXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY.
text: WILL turns into a narrow street and walks toward a
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: To my weekly confession.
text: As HENSLOWE arrives the door closes in his face. A sign
text: identifies the place as the premises of Dr. MOTH,
dialog: apothecary, alchemist, astrologer, seer, interpreter of
text: dreams, and priest of psyche. HENSLOWE looks puzzled.
scene_heading: INT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY
text: A stuffed alligator hangs from the ceiling, pills,
text: potions, amulets and charms, star charts and mystic
text: paraphernalia festoon the place. Testimonials and framed
text: degrees hang on the walls.
text: WILL lying on a couch, on his back. His eyes are closed
text: DR. MOTH sits by the couch, listening to WILL and
text: occasionally making a note on a pad he holds on his knee.
dialog: What we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of
text: analysis. The session is being timed by an hourglass.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Words, words, wordsonce, I had the
dialog: giftI could make love out of words as
text: a potter makes cups out of clay love
dialog: that overthrows empires, love that
dialog: binds two hearts together come
text: hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a
dialog: line, I could cause a riot in a
dialog: nunnerybut now
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
dialog: And yet you tell me you lie with
dialog: women?
text: WILL seems unwiling to respond. DR. MOTH refers to his
dialog: notes.
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline,
text: Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who
dialog: does it behind the Dog and
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Aye, now and again, but what of it? I
dialog: have lost my gift.
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
dialog: I am here to help you. Tell me in your
dialog: own words.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I have lost my gift.
dialog: (not finding this easy)
text: It's as if my quill is broken. As if
dialog: the organ of the imagination has dried
dialog: up. As if the proud tower of my genius
text: has collapsed.
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
dialog: Interesting.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Nothing comes.
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
dialog: Most interesting.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: It is like trying to a pick a lock
text: with a wet herring.
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
dialog: (shrewdly)
dialog: Tell me, are you lately humbled in the
dialog: act of love?
text: WILL turns towards him. How did he know that?
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH (CONT'D)
dialog: How long has it been?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: A goodly length in times past, but
dialog: lately
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
dialog: No, no. You have a wife, children
text: The sand runs through the hourglass.
speaker_heading: LATER
dialog: Not much sand left.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway
text: was a woman, half as old again.
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
dialog: A woman of property?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: She had a cottage. One day, she was
dialog: three months gone with child, so
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
dialog: And your relations?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: On my mother's side the Ardens
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
dialog: No, your marriage bed.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Four years and a hundred miles away in
dialog: Stratford.
dialog: A cold bed too, since the twins were
dialog: born. Banishment was a blessing.
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
dialog: So now you are free to love
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: yet cannot love nor write it.
text: DR. MOTH reaches for a glass snake bracelet.
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
text: Here is a bangle found in Psyche's
text: temple on Olympus cheap at four pence.
dialog: Write your name on a paper and feed it
text: in the snake.
text: WILL looks at the snake bangle in wonder.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Will it restore my gift?
speaker_heading: DR. MOTH
text: The woman who wears the snake will
dialog: dream of you, and your gift will
text: return. Words will flow like a river.
dialog: I will see you in a week.
text: He holds out his hand. WILL drops a sovereign into it,
text: and takes the bracelet.
scene_heading: EXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY.
text: WILL comes out. HENSLOWE is waiting, standing in a horse
text: trough to ease his feet. WILL walks straight past him,
text: and HENSLOWE follows.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Now where? Will?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: To the Palace at Whitehall.
scene_heading: INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.
text: WHITEHALL means nothing yet. We are behind closed
text: curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the
text: imminent performance of Two Gentlemen of Verona. This is
dialog: not a theatre but a banqueting hall, as we will see.
text: RICHARD BURBAGE is to play "PROTEUS." A BOY PLAYER will
text: play "SILVIA," and last minute improvements to his makeup
text: etc. are being applied by BURBAGE'S mistress ROSALINE.
text: "LAUNCE," one of the clowns, is the famous comedian WILL
text: KEMPE. "LAUNCE'S" dog, CRAB is in KEMPE'S charge and is
text: not helping much. There is no set. A helpful placard
text: reading VERONA--AN OPEN PLACE, is ready to hand. MUSICIANS
text: can be heard tuning their instruments. From the other
text: side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub. KEMPE
text: leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of
text: proops. He finds a skull. He has one foot on the box, his
text: elbow on his knee, he looks at the skullin other words
text: he reminds us of Hamlet. We see this from the POV of
text: WILL, who is just entering through a door backstage.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (approaching)
dialog: Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg. You
dialog: too, good Crab.
speaker_heading: KEMPE
text: Crab is nervous. He has never played
dialog: the Palace. When will you write me a
dialog: tragedy, Will? I could do it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No, they would laugh at Seneca if you
dialog: played it.
text: WILL'S attention has been caught by ROSALINE, BURBAGE'S
text: mistress. ROSALINE is big breasted, dark-eyed, dark-
dialog: haired, sexual.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
speaker_heading: (to ROSALINE)
dialog: My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress
dialog: Rosaline, where were my seamstress's
dialog: eyes?
text: BURBAGE kisses her mouth and slaps her behind. He comes
text: over to greet WILL.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE (CONT'D)
text: There is no dog in the first scene,
dialog: Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it
dialog: Will?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I am still owed money for this play,
dialog: Burbage.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Not from me. I only stole it. When are
dialog: you coming over to the Chamberlain's
dialog: Men?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: When I have fifty pounds.
text: ROSALINE brings over the last elements of BURBAGE'S
text: costume and helps him into them.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Are you writing?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (nods somewhat defensively)
text: A comedy. All but done, a pirate
dialog: comedy, wonderful.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: What is the chief part?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: The title?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Romeo
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Ten pounds.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: You're a liar.
text: BURBAGE digs under his costume for his purse, which is on
text: a waistband, over his corset.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and
dialog: the Admiral's Men.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Ned is wrong for it.
text: WILL turns to see HENSLOWE approaching.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (to WILL)
dialog: Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you
dialog: two more when you show me the pages.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (arriving)
dialog: Burbage, I will see you hanged for a
dialog: pickpocket.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: The Queen has commanded, she loves a
dialog: comedy and the Master of the Revels
dialog: favours us.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: And what favour does Mr. Tilney
dialog: receive from you?
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Ask him.
text: The Master of the Revels (TILNEY) comes through the
text: curtain officiously.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: She comes!
text: He disappears back through the curtains. The hubbub falls
text: silent, rather dramatically, and all the busy PLAYERS
text: know what that means: they all crowd to the curtain and
dialog: find places to peep through.
scene_heading: INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF
scene_heading: HOUSE/STAGE. DAY.
text: THE POV OF THE PLAYERS.
text: The arrival of QUEEN ELIZABETH, aged sixty, coming to
text: take her place in the audience at front centre. The hill
text: is crowded with lords and ladies, bowing ELIZABETH to her
text: seat, which is raised high on a pedestal, affording the
text: QUEEN an uninterrupted view of the play, and the audience
text: an uninterrupted view of the QUEEN. Trumpets sound.
text: Close on a small piece of paper: a quill is writing "W.
text: Shakespeare." WILL rolls the paper up carefully and slips
text: it into the mouth of the snake bangle.
text: The curtain draws back and CONDELL as "VALENTINE" and
text: BURBAGE as "PROTEUS" begin the play.
scene_heading: CONDELL AS VALENTINE
dialog: "Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus;
dialog: Home-keeping youth have ever homely
dialog: wits"
scene_heading: INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. THE
scene_heading: WINGS/BACKSTAGE. DAY.
text: With BURBAGES'S presence accounted for on stage, ROSALINE
text: curls an arm around WILL'S neck. They kiss hungrily.
text: After a moment, WILL pulls back.
speaker_heading: ROSALINE
dialog: When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I have lost my gift.
speaker_heading: ROSALINE
dialog: You left it in my bed. Come to look
dialog: for it again.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
speaker_heading: ROSALINE
dialog: Burbage has my keeping but you have my
dialog: heart.
text: WILL takes the snake bracelet and slips it onto her arm.
text: ROSALINE looks at it, then at WILL. Then they kiss again,
text: but WILL is distracted by the sound of coughing from the
dialog: auditorium.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You see? The consumptives plot against
dialog: me. "Will Shakespeare has a play, let
dialog: us go and cough through it."
scene_heading: INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. STAGE. DAY.
text: "VALENTINE" is on stage with "PROTEUS."
scene_heading: CONDELL AS VALENTINE
dialog: "To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans: Coy
text: looks with heart sore sighs; One fading moment's mirth
dialog: With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights"
text: As the scene continues, WILL appears at the back of the
text: hall and finds himself next to HENSLOWE.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: I feel a scene coming on.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Is it about a pirate's daughter?
scene_heading: INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACK OF THE BANQUETING HALL/STAGE.
speaker_heading: DAY.
text: Laughter. It is later, and KEMPE is now on stage with his
text: dog. The audience is roaring.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: You see? Comedy.
text: QUEEN ELIZABETH'S idiosyncratic laugh rises above the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Well played, Master Crab, I commend
dialog: you.
text: She throws a sweetheart on the stage and the dog wolfs it
text: down. Everyone applauds.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Love and a bit with a dog, that's what
dialog: they like.
text: Now we meet VIOLA. VIOLA DE LESSEPS is twenty-five and
text: beautiful, and she is laughing with great natural
text: enjoyment. She sits slightly apart from her small family
text: group--her parents, SIR ROBERT DE LESSEPS and LADY
text: MARGARET DE LESSEPS. Part of the group but seated behind
text: as befits her lower status is VIOLA'S NURSE.
text: Elsewhere is LORD WESSEX, our villain. WESSEX is in his
text: forties, dark cruel, self-important. He has noticed
text: VIOLA. The nurse notices him.
scene_heading: INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF
scene_heading: HOUSE/STAGE. DAY.
text: LATER. "VALENTINE" is on stage alone. He is speaking the
text: speech rather more coarsely than the version we hear
dialog: later.
scene_heading: CONDELL AS VALENTINE
dialog: "What light is light if Silvia be not
dialog: seen?
dialog: What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
dialog: Unless it be to think that she is by
dialog: And feed upon the shadow of
dialog: perfection"
text: Now we see that VIOLA knows the speech by heart, and is
text: silently mouthing it with the actor.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: There's a lady knows your play by
dialog: heart.
text: But when he turns to WILL he finds that WILL has gone.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.
text: WILL comes into his room, goes straight to his table in
text: the window, and arranges pen, ink, and paper. Now he has
text: his ritual: he spins round once in a circle, rubs his
text: hands together and spits on the floor. Then he sits down,
text: picks up his pen, and stares in front of him. PAUSE. Then
text: he begins to write.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: The NURSE is undressing her, though VIOLA tries
text: intermittently to push her away. She is still bright with
dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Did you like Proteus or Valentine
dialog: best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine
dialog: for looks.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I liked the dog, for laughs.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: But Silvia I did not care for much.
text: His fingers were red from fighting and
text: he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons.
dialog: Stage love will never be true love
dialog: while the law of the land has our
text: heroines played by pipsqueak boys in
dialog: petticoats! Oh, when can we see
dialog: another?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: When the Queen commands it.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: But at the playhouse. Nurse?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Be still.
text: Now the NURSE is cleaning VIOLA'S ears, one by one, of
text: course. She has an ear-cleaning implement for this. VIOLA
dialog: submits.
speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Playhouses are not for well-born
dialog: ladies.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: I am not so well-born.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Well-monied is the same as well-born
dialog: and well-married is more so. Lord
dialog: Wessex was looking at you tonight.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
text: All the men at court are without
dialog: poetry. If they look at me they see my
dialog: father's fortune. I will have poetry
dialog: in my life. And adventure. And love.
dialog: Love above all.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Like Valentine and Silvia?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: No . . . not the artful postures of
dialog: love, but love that over- throws life.
text: Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot
dialog: in the heart, and nothing to be done,
dialog: come ruin or rapture. Love like there
dialog: has never been in a play.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I will have love or I will end my days
dialog: as a . . .
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: As a nurse.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (kissing her)
dialog: But I would be Valentine and Silvia
dialog: too. Good Nurse, God save you and good
dialog: night. I would stay asleep my whole
dialog: life if I could dream myself into a
dialog: company of players.
text: VIOLA goes over to the window.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: The NURSE thrusts a twig to her face.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Clean your teeth while you dream,
dialog: then.
text: Automatically, VIOLA takes the twig and begins brushing
text: her teeth, all the while looking downriver towards the
text: Rose. The NURSE attends her with a beaker of water, and a
dialog: bowl.
speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now spit
text: VIOLA gazes longingly towards the Rose And, there and
text: then, she makes a plan.
scene_heading: EXT. SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.
text: HENSLOWE is making his way from the theatre to the market
text: place when FENNYMAN and LAMBERT appear at either shoulder
text: and propel him back the way he came. FREES follows
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: This time we take your boots off!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: The theatres are all closed by the
dialog: plague!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Oh, that.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: by order of the Master of the Revels!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the
dialog: theatre business.
dialog: (they stop)
dialog: The natural condition is one of
text: insurmountable obstacles on the road
dialog: to imminent disaster. Believe me, to
text: be close by the plague is a bagatelle
dialog: in the ups and downs of owning a
dialog: theatre.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: So what do we do?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Nothing. Strangely enough , it all
dialog: turns out well.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: I don't know. It's a mystery.
speaker_heading: LAMBERT
dialog: (dumbly)
dialog: Should I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?
text: At this point din is heard in the background. a
text: messenger, ringing a bell, is running though the street.
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: The theatres are reopened. By order of
dialog: the Master of the Revels, the theatres
dialog: are reopened
text: FENNYMAN is intrigued.
speaker_heading: FREES
dialog: Mr. Fennyman! Mr. Tilney has opened
dialog: the playhouses.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Yes I heard.
text: HENSLOWE plays his temporary advantage modestly,
text: shrugging himself free of LAMBERT'S grip.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
speaker_heading: (to LAMBERT)
dialog: If you wouldn't mind
text: HENSLOWE continues on his way. FENNYMAN watches HENSLOWE,
dialog: curious.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Where is the play?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.
text: It is. WILL is writing furiously. A burnt-down candle is
text: still alight, although it is day outside the window. He
dialog: has been writing all night. He has written about ten
text: pages. Pleased with himself and excited, he gathers them
text: up and leaves the room like a man with a mission.
scene_heading: EXT. WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.
text: Leaving the house, pages in hand, WILL nearly knocks down
text: HENSLOWE who has come to see him.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Will! The theatres are
text: Before he can finish, WILL brandishes the pages in his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God,
dialog: I'm good!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
text: WILL has gone.
scene_heading: EXT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.
text: BURBAGE lives in another part of the city. WILL bangs
text: through the door without ceremony.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Richard!
scene_heading: INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.
text: WILL enters and calls out.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Burbage?
scene_heading: INT. BURBAGE'S BEDROOM. DAY.
text: WILL charges into the bedroom. ROSALINE is in bed. The
text: Master of the Revels is pulling up his breeches. WILL is
text: shattered.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Mr. Tilney
text: The unsuccessful snake bracelet glints at him from
text: ROSALINE'S arm.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: Like you, I found him not at home!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: So this is the favour you find in the
dialog: Chamberlain's Men.
speaker_heading: ROSALINE
dialog: Will!
speaker_heading: WILL
speaker_heading: (to ROSALINE)
dialog: I would have made you immortal.
dialog: (turning to go)
dialog: Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by
dialog: Will Shakespeare.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: What does Burbage care of that? He is
text: readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You have opened the playhouses?
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: I have, Master Shakespeare.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: But the plague
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Yes, I know. But he was always hanging
text: around the house.
text: A bell can be heard ringing outside.
speaker_heading: ROSALINE
dialog: (to WILL, leaving)
dialog: Willyou're the only one, Will!--in my
dialog: heart.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.
text: WILL emerges looking distraught. A burning brazier stands
text: by the wall. WILL thrusts the pages into the coals. He
text: watches for a moment as the pages catch fire.
scene_heading: INT. TAVERN. DAY.
text: WILL walks in to find the place in an uproar of
text: celebration. A handsome young serving man (NOL) is
text: bumping through with a tray of tankards.
speaker_heading: NOL
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: Mr. Henslowe!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Yes, I heard. The theatres are open.
dialog: But where is my playwright?
text: HENSLOWE finds a seat, and takes a tankard off NOL'S
dialog: tray.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Chalk it up, Nol. I'm hungry, too.
speaker_heading: NOL
dialog: The special today is a pig's foot
text: marinated in juniper-berry vinegar,
text: served with a buckwheat pancake which
dialog: has been
text: They are interrupted by WILL who joins them. He looks
text: distracted.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Will! Have you finished?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yes. Nearly.
dialog: (he taps his forehead)
dialog: It's all locked safe in here. We need
dialog: Ralph for the Pirate King. Good
dialog: morning, Master Nol. You will have a
dialog: nice little part.
text: NOL shouts for you, takes off his apron and flings it
text: behind the bar. HENSLOWE jumps up and embraces WILL. The
text: entire staff and half the customers are now crowding
text: around, actors the lot of them. HENSLOWE bangs the table
dialog: to shut them all up.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
text: Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men are
dialog: out on tour. I need actors. Those here
dialog: who are unknown will have a chance to
dialog: be known.
speaker_heading: ACTOR
dialog: What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: It won't cost you a penny! Auditions
dialog: in half-an-hour!
text: The din of excited chatter returns. He sweeps grandly to
text: the tavern doorwhere he meets RALPH BASHFORD, a big,
text: burly, middle-aged actor.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ralph Bashford! I'd have a part for
dialog: you but, alas, I hear you are a
text: drunkard's drunkard.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Never when I'm working.
scene_heading: INT. TAVERN. DAY.
text: WILL has remained behind, aghast now at his predicament.
text: He goes to the bar.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Give me to drink mandragora.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: Straight up, Will?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Give my friend a beaker of your best
dialog: brandy.
text: WILL turns towards a figure further down the bar. It's
scene_heading: CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Kit
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: How goes it, Will?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Wonderful, wonderful.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: Burbage says you have a play.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I have. And chinks to show for it.
text: His drink arrives. WILL places a sovereign on the bar.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe.
text: The BARMAN does the business.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I hear you have a new play for the
dialog: Curtain.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I love your early work. "Was this the
dialog: face that launched a thousand ships
dialog: and burnt the topless towers of
dialog: Ilium?"
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: I have a new one nearly done, and
dialog: better. The Massacre at Paris.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Good title.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: And yours?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
text: (beat, sighs despondently)
dialog: Yes, I know.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: What is the story?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well, there's a pirate
dialog: (confesses)
dialog: In truth, I have not written a word.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yes, that's good. Until he meets
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: Ethel.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you think?
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
text: The daughter of his enemy.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (thoughtfully)
text: The daughter of his enemy.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
text: His best friend is killed in a duel by
dialog: Ethel's brother or something. His name
dialog: is Mercutio.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Mercutiogood name.
text: NOL hurries back to WILL'S side.
speaker_heading: NOL
dialog: Will--they're waiting for you!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm coming.
text: He drains his glass.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Good luck with yours, Kit.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: I thought your play was for Burbage.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: This is a different one.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: (trying to work it out)
dialog: A different one you haven't written?
text: WILL makes a helpless gesture and hurries after NOL.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. GALLERY/STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: HENSLOWE and WILL are sitting in the gallery, listening
text: to a YOUNG ACTOR auditioning.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ACTOR
dialog: " Was this the face that launched a
dialog: thousand ships, And burnt the topless
dialog: towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make me
dialog: immortal with a kiss!"
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Thank you.
text: HENSLOWE and WILL look a bit deflated. The YOUNG ACTOR
text: leaves and is replaced by a SECOND ACTOR.
speaker_heading: SECOND ACTOR
dialog: I would like to give you something
dialog: from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: How refreshing.
speaker_heading: SECOND ACTOR
dialog: "Was this the face that launched a
dialog: thousand ships, And burnt the topless
dialog: towers of Ilium?"
text: HENSLOWE and WILL let him continue a bit further, but
text: exchange despairing looks. A succession of would-be
text: actors offer their version of Marlowe's lines, each as
text: inappropriate as the other. Among them is a small URCHIN.
speaker_heading: URCHIN
dialog: "the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet
dialog: Helen, make me immortal with a--?"
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (bellows)
dialog: Thank you!
text: The URCHIN leaves, glowering furiously, and is replaced
text: by a beanpole of a man (WASBASH). WABASH has a bad
text: stutter.
speaker_heading: WABASH
dialog: "W-w-w-w-was th-th-this th-th-the f-f-
dialog: f-face"
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (unexpectedly)
dialog: Very good, Mr. Wabash. Excellent.
dialog: Report to the property master.
text: WILL looks at HENSLOWE in outrage.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
dialog: (apologetically)
dialog: My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I
dialog: have a few debts here and there. Well,
dialog: that seems to be everybody. Did you
dialog: see a Romeo?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I did not.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Well, I to my work, you to yours. When
dialog: can I see pages?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Tomorrow
text: HENSLOWE leaves him.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (a prayer)
dialog: please God.
text: WILL sits brooding alone for a moment. Then he realizes
text: he is being addressed from the stage. ANOTHER ACTOR.
speaker_heading: ACTOR
dialog: May I begin, sir?
text: WILL looks at the stage and sees a handsome young man,
text: with a hat shadowing his eyes.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Your name?
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: Thomas Kent. I would like to do a
text: speech by a writer who commands the
dialog: heart of every player.
text: WILL can hardly manage a nod.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: "What light is light, if Silvia be not
dialog: seen, What joy is joy, if Silvia be
dialog: not by? Unless it be to think that she
dialog: is by And feed upon the shadow of
dialog: perfection.
text: It does not take four lines of "VALENTINE'S" speech to
dialog: confirm for us, if confirmation be needed, that THOMAS is
text: VIOLA. For WILL, amazement at hearing his own words soon
text: gives away to something else. He is captivated. He has
dialog: found his "ROMEO".
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: " except I be by Silvia in the night,
text: There is no music in the nightingale.
dialog: Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
dialog: There is no day for me to look upon."
text: WILL interrupts "him."
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Take off your hat.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: My hat?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Where did you learn how to do that?
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: I . . .
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Wait there.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Let me see you. Take off your hat.
text: THOMAS begins to panic. WILL jumps down to ground level.
text: THOMAS runs offstage, to WILL'S bewilderment. WILL
text: hurries after him. We go with WILL as he crosses the
text: stage, then backstage, then into the
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. RETIRING ROOM. DAY.
text: RETIRING ROOM which is crowded with actors and HENSLOWE'S
dialog: lieutenant, property manager, copier, and general
text: factotum who is a new character, PETER.
speaker_heading: ACTOR
dialog: What are we playing?
speaker_heading: NOL
dialog: Where are the pages?
text: WILL enters into the middle of this.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Where's the boy?
text: NOBODY knows what he is talking about. WABASH, the
text: stutterer, grabs Will's hand and shakes it excitedly.
speaker_heading: WABASH
dialog: B-b-b-b-break a l-l-l-leg!
text: The street door is swinging shut. WILL sees it. He fights
text: his way through the men to get to the door.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BANKSIDE. DAY.
text: WILL emerges from the theatre into a street throbbing
text: with nefarious life. Whores, cutpurses, hawkers, urchins,
text: tract-sellers, riffraff of all kinds in an area of stews
text: (lowdown pubs), brothels and slums. It is some time
text: before WILL spots THOMAS, way ahead of him in the crowded
text: street. The chase is taking them to the riverbank.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.
text: When WILL gets to the riverbank he sees that THOMAS is in
text: a smallish boat being rowed upriver and in midstream. The
text: river is quite busy, and among the boats there are a
text: number of waiting "taxis." WILL jumps into the nearest
text: one and shouts at the "Taxi Driver" BOATMAN.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Follow that boat!
speaker_heading: BOATMAN
dialog: Right you are, governor!
text: WILL sits in the stern of the boat and the BOATMAN sits
text: facing him, rowing lustily.
speaker_heading: BOATMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I know your face. Are you an actor?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (oh God, here we go again)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BOATMAN
dialog: Yes, I've seen you in something. That
dialog: one about a king.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BOATMAN
dialog: I had the Christopher Marlowe in my
dialog: boat once.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.
text: LATER. The BOATMAN is puffing. WILL is looking ahead to
text: where THOMAS'S boat has reached a jetty on the farther
text: shore, a private jetty attached to a rich house on the
text: north bank. WILL sees THOMAS jump out of his boat and run
text: toward the house.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you know that house?
speaker_heading: BOATMAN
dialog: Sir Robert De Lesseps.
scene_heading: EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.
text: WILL runs towards the house.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES'S HOUSE. DAY.
text: THOMAS rushes up the back stairs, removing his hat. Her
text: hair tumbles down about her shoulders, so we will call
text: her VIOLA again.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY.
text: Her mother LADY DE LESSEPS, is talking to the NURSE.
speaker_heading: LADY DE LESSEPS
dialog: Where is she? Our guests are upon us, Lord Wessex too,
dialog: bargaining for a bride. My husband will have it settled
dialog: tonight.
text: Behind her, the door opens revealing VIOLA as THOMAS to
text: the NURSES view, but only for a moment. The door closes
text: again as LADY DE LESSEPS turns.
speaker_heading: LADY DE LESSEPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Tomorrow he drags me off to the
dialog: country and it will be three weeks
dialog: gone before we return from our
dialog: estates.
text: A different door communicating to the next room, opens
text: and VIOLA comes in after a lightning dress change into a
text: robe. She curtseys to her mother.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: God save you, mother.
dialog: (to NURSE)
dialog: Ho water, nurse.
text: The NURSE looks at her, round-eyed.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY.
text: From a cauldron on the stove, hot water is poured into
text: two pails, by the a KITCHEN BOY under the NURSE'S
dialog: command.
speaker_heading: SCULLERY MAID (O.S.)
dialog: Thomas Kent, sir? No sir.
speaker_heading: WILL (O.S.)
dialog: The actor
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Who asks for him?
text: WILL has come to the kitchen door with a letter.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and
dialog: playwright of the Rose.
text: The NURSE sends the SCULLERY MAID back to work.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Master Kent ismy nephew.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (giving her the letter)
dialog: I will wait.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Much god may it do you.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BATHROOM. EVENING.
text: VIOLA in her bath, reads WILL'S letter. The NURSE is
text: adding hot water to the tub.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague,
text: a young man of Verona.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (unimpressed)
dialog: Verona again.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (devouring the letter)
text: A comedy of quarreling families
dialog: reconciled in the discovery of Romeo
dialog: to be the very same Capulet cousin
text: stolen from the cradle and fostered to
dialog: manhood by his Montague mother that
dialog: was robbed of her own child by the
dialog: Pirate King!
scene_heading: EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: WILL waits hopefully. The kitchen door opens and a
text: SERVANT flings a bucket of dirty water in the general
text: direction of the gutter. WILL hops nimbly aside and
text: escapes a soaking.
speaker_heading: SERVANT
dialog: Be off!
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: The NURSE is helping VIOLA into her party dress.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Your mother, and your father
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (gaily)
dialog: From tomorrow, away in the country for
dialog: three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not
dialog: handsome?
speaker_heading: NURSE
text: He looks well enough for a mountebank.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent
dialog: the life of Viola De Lesseps's
dialog: dreaming.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: My lady, this play will end badly. I
dialog: will tell.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (twice as firmly)
dialog: You will not tell. As you love me and
dialog: as I love you, you will bind my breast
dialog: and buy me a boy's wig!
scene_heading: EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: WILL spots a gaggle of MUSICIANS approaching, carrying
text: instruments. WILL recognizes them.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Master Plum! What business here?
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: A five shilling business, Will. We
dialog: play for the dancing.
text: The sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a
text: GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who
text: have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the
text: house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX
text: skid to a halt and enter the house.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. BANQUETING ROOM. NIGHT.
text: WILL has got in with the MUSICIANS. Competently enough he
text: strums along with them on the bandstand. Two dozen guests
text: are enough to crowd the space for dancing. WILL glances
text: around, looking for THOMAS KENT. He stops a passing
text: SERVANT, helping himself to a snack off the man's tray.
speaker_heading: SERVANT
dialog: Musicians don't eat, Sir Robert's
dialog: orders.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I seek Master Thomas Kent.
text: It means nothing to the SERVANT who moves on. ANGLE ON
scene_heading: WESSEX and SIR ROBERT.
speaker_heading: SIR ROBERT
dialog: She is a beauty, my lord, as would
dialog: take a king to church for a dowry of a
dialog: nutmeg.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: My plantations in Virginia are not
dialog: mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an
dialog: ancient name that will bring you
dialog: preferment when your grandson is a
dialog: Wessex. Is she fertile?
speaker_heading: SIR ROBERT
dialog: She will breed. If she do not, send
text: her back.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Is she obedient?
speaker_heading: SIR ROBERT
dialog: As any mule in Christendom. But if you
dialog: are the man to rider her, their are
text: rubies in the saddlebag.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: I like her.
text: ANGLE on WILL--watching the dancing. Then he sees VIOLA in
text: the crowd. He turns to blood.
text: Love at first sight, no doubt about it. VIOLA has not
text: seen him. She is doing a daughter's duty among her
text: parents' friends. The guests form up to begin a changing-
dialog: partners dance (the very same one you get in every ROMEO
speaker_heading: and JULIET).
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (to Musician)
dialog: By all the stars in heaven, who is
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: Viola de Lesseps. Dream on, Will.
text: WILL leaves the bandstand and is moving trancelike to
text: keep her in view between the dancers and onlookers. VIOLA
text: moves through patterns of the dance untilas night
text: follows day, she finds WILL opposite her. He has
text: insinuated himself into the dance. VIOLA gasps.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Master Shakespeare
text: WILL reacts, surprised by her reaction. The dance
text: separates them. VIOLA finds herself opposite WESSEX.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: My lady Viola.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: My lord.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: I have spoken with your father.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: So my lord? I speak with him every
dialog: day.
text: WESSEX scowls. The dance separates them. VIOLA finds
text: herself opposite WILL again. WILL stares at her
text: entranced.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Good sir ?
text: WILL has lost his tongue.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: I heard you are a poet.
text: WILL nods in his trance and she smiles at him.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: But a poet of no words?
text: WILL tries to speak but the silver tongue won't work. He
text: is dumb with adoration. Suddenly WESSEX takes him affably
text: by the elbow and leads him into an alcove.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (smiling evilly)
dialog: "Poet?"
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (coming round form the
text: anaesthetic and not noticing
dialog: the danger)
dialog: I was a poet till now, but I have seen
dialog: beauty that puts my poems at one with
text: the talking ravens at the Tower.
text: To his surprise he finds a lordly dagger at this throat.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (startled)
dialog: How do I offend, my lord?
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: By coveting my property. I cannot shed
dialog: blood in her house but I will cut your
dialog: throat anon. You have a name?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (gulps)
dialog: Christopher Marlowe at your service.
text: WESSEX shoves him through the nearest door.
text: VIOLA'S eyes are searching the room for WILL. She finds
text: WESSEX smiling at her. She looks away.
scene_heading: EXT. DE LESSEPS' GARDEN/VIOLA'S BALCONY. NIGHT
text: There is a lighted window on the balcony. VIOLA, dressed
text: for bed, and the NURSE pass across the lighted space.
text: WILL is in the garden. He sees her. The light in the room
text: is extinguished. WILL sighs. Then VIOLA comes out onto
text: the balcony in the moonlight. WILL gasps. He watches her.
text: VIOLA sighs dreamily.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of
text: Verona. A comedy. By William
dialog: Shakespeare.
text: WILL reckons that's a good enough cue. He comes out of
text: hiding, and approaches the balcony.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: My lady!
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (gasps)
dialog: Who is there?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Will Shakespeare!
text: The NURSE calls "Madam!" from inside the room.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Anon, good nurse. Anon.
speaker_heading: (to WILL)
dialog: Master Shakespeare?!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The same, alas.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Oh but why "alas?"
speaker_heading: WILL
text: A lowly player.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Alas indeed, for I thought you the
dialog: highest poet of my esteem and a writer
dialog: of plays that capture my heart.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh--I am him too!
text: The NURSE calls again.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (to NURSE)
dialog: Anon, anon!
speaker_heading: (to WILL)
dialog: I will come again.
text: She goes inside for a moment.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be
dialog: punished for this!
text: VIOLA returns. WILL comes forward again.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my lady, my love!
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: If they find you here they will kill
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You can bring them with a word.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Oh, not for the world!
text: The NURSE calls her again: "Madam!"
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Anon, nurse!
text: But she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that
text: there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb
text: up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a
text: soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops
text: his head over the parapet and is face to face with the
text: NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the
dialog: tree.
scene_heading: EXT. DE LEESEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.
text: Male voice shout to each other inside the house, candle
text: flames appear in different windows, the garden door is
text: flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one
text: hand and sword in the other. By this time WILL is on top
text: of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight. He
dialog: could have written it better.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAWN.
text: WILL is burning the midnight oil--literally and
text: metaphorically. His quill has already covered a dozen
text: sheets. He is inspired.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: It is day one. THE COMPANY is on stage. PETER is passing
text: pages around a bunch of actors. JOHN, JAMES, and NOL are
text: looking through their pages.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: "Draw if you be men!
dialog: (to JAMES)
dialog: Gregory, remember thy washing blow."
speaker_heading: NOL
dialog: "Part, fools, put up your swords."
text: WILL is going around pumping hands and slapping
text: shoulders, flushed with excitement. HENSLOWE is reading
text: his pages, worried. RALPH BASHFORD is next to him.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
text: It starts well, and then it's all long-
dialog: faced about some Rosaline. Where's the
dialog: comedy, Will. Where's the dog?
speaker_heading: (to RALPH)
dialog: Do you think it is funny?
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: I was a Pirate King, now I'm a Nurse.
dialog: That's funny
text: WILL pulls HENSLOWE aside.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We are at least six men short, and
dialog: those we have will be overparted,
dialog: ranters and stutterers who should be
dialog: sent back to the stews. My Romeo has
dialog: let me down. I see disaster.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: We are at least four acts short, Will,
dialog: if you are looking for disaster.
text: WILL as notices a young scruffy thirteen-year-old actor,
dialog: the URCHIN we met before.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Who are you, master?
speaker_heading: URCHIN
dialog: I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (furiously)
dialog: I'll be damned if you are!
text: And he helps the URCHIN off with a kick. The URCHIN
text: glowers with resentment. HENSLOWE finds himself face to
text: face with FENNYMAN.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Is it going well?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Very well.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
text: But nothing is happening.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Yes, but very well.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Who is that?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Nobody. The author.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We are about to embark on a great
dialog: voyage.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: It is customary to make a little
dialog: speech on the first day. It does no
dialog: harm and authors like it.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You want to know what parts you are to
dialog: receive. All will be settled as we go
dialog: That's as far as he gets before there is a dramatic
text: interruption--the public entrance door is flung open and
text: SIX MEN make a loud entrance, headed by NED ALLEYN, the
text: actor, who is a handsome piratical figure with a big
text: voice and a big sword.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: Huzzah! The Admiral's Men are returned
dialog: to the house!
text: He gets various reactions. HENSLOWE and WILL shout his
text: name joyfully, some of the actors are friends with the
dialog: new group and behave accordingly, others know they are
text: out of a job. FENNYMAN recovers, or tries to.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Who is this?
text: ALLEYN slaps him aside with his sword.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: (roars)
dialog: Silence, you god! I am Hieronimo! I am
dialog: Tamburlaine! I am Faustus! I am
dialog: Barrabas, the Jew of Malta--of yes,
dialog: Master Will, and I am Henry VI. What
dialog: is the play, and what is my part?
text: FENNYMAN is impressed.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: A moment, sir!
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: (roars)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: (bleating)
dialog: I am the money!
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: Then you may remain so long as you
dialog: remain silent. Pay attention and you
dialog: will see how genius creates a legend.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: (respectfully)
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We are in desperate want of a
text: Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of
dialog: Verona
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: And the title of this piece?
speaker_heading: WILL
speaker_heading: Mercutio
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: I will play him!
text: Half a dozen of the ADMIRAL'S MEN will be given roles in
text: our play and we meet them and identify them as WILL
text: enthusiastically shakes hands.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome,
dialog: George Bryan! James Armitage!
dialog: (and now greeting SAM GOSSE,
dialog: the female star of the
dialog: Admiral's Men)
dialog: Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to
dialog: fall in love again?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (hoarsely)
dialog: I am, Master Shakespeare.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: But your voice
text: (he thrust a hand between
speaker_heading: SAM'S legs)
dialog: Have they dropped?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (a girlie voice now)
dialog: No, no, a touch of cold only. We
text: suspect he is lying but WILL has
dialog: turned away.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
text: He leaves, passing by the humbled FENNYMAN.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: I saw his Tamburlaine, you know.
dialog: Wonderful.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yes, I saw it.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Of course, it was mighty writing.
dialog: There is no one like Marlowe
text: WILL is used to it. He goes.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK. DAY.
text: WILL arrives in a hurry at the wharfside, and looks
text: vainly in the direction of the DE LESSEPSES' house: no
speaker_heading: THOMAS.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE DOOR. DAY.
text: WILL looks down the alley:--no THOMAS. He turns away. The
text: URCHIN, the short-lived Ethel, is sitting in the alley.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Better fortune, boy.
speaker_heading: URCHIN
dialog: (shrugs)
text: I was in a play. They cut my head off
dialog: in Titus Andronicus. When I write
dialog: plays, they will be like Titus.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: You admire it?
text: The URCHIN nods grimly.
speaker_heading: URCHIN
dialog: I like it when they cut heads off. And
text: the daughter mutilated with knives.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh. What is your name?
speaker_heading: URCHIN.
dialog: John Webster. Here, kitty, kitty.
text: Because a stray cat is nearby. The cat show an interest.
text: The URCHIN passes a white mouse to the cat and watches
text: the result with sober interest.
speaker_heading: URCHIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Plenty of blood. That is the only
dialog: writing.
text: WILL backs away, unnerved by the boy.
speaker_heading: URCHIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait, you'll see the cat bites his
text: head off.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I have to get back.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: On stage . . . the actors carry their parts.
speaker_heading: NOL AS BENVOLIO
dialog: "See where he comes. So please you step aside; I'll know
dialog: his grievance or be much denied."
speaker_heading: MONTAGUE
dialog: "I would thou wert so happy by thy
dialog: stay To hear true shrift. Come, madam,
dialog: let's away."
text: Onstage "MONTAGUE" and "LADY MONTAGUE" make their exit.
text: Offstage, WILL appears next to HENSLOWE.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Cut round him for now.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (not understanding)
dialog: What? Who?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Romeo.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: The one who came with your letter?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NOL AS BENVOLIO (O.S.)
dialog: "Good morrow, cousin."
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO (O.S.)
dialog: "Is the day so young?"
text: The voice is THOMAS'S. WILL turns back to the stage and
text: sees him. Today THOMAS has a wig as well as his small
text: mustache.
speaker_heading: NOL AS BENVOLIO
dialog: "But new struck nine."
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that
dialog: my father that went hence so fast?"
speaker_heading: NOL AS BENVOLIO
dialog: It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's
dialog: hours?"
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "Not having that which, having, makes
dialog: them short."
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Good
speaker_heading: NOL AS BENVOLIO
dialog: "In love?"
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "Out."
speaker_heading: NOL AS BENVOLIO
dialog: "Of love?"
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "Out of her favour where I am in
dialog: love."
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: No, no, noDon't spend it all at once!
text: The rehearsal stops.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Do you understand me?
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He is speaking about a baggage we
dialog: never even meet! What will be left in
dialog: your purse when he meets his Juliet?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Juliet? You mean Ethel.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (rounding on him)
dialog: God's teeth, am I to suffer this
dialog: constant stream of interruption?!
speaker_heading: (to THOMAS)
dialog: What will you do in Act Two when he
dialog: meets the love of his life?
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
text: (timidly--looking through his
dialog: few sheets of paper)
dialog: I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen
dialog: Act Two.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Of course you have not! I have not
dialog: written it!
text: Alone in the auditorium, FENNYMAN looks and listens,
dialog: fascinated. So this is theatre!
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Go once more!
text: NED ALLEYN comes out of the wings, frowning over his
dialog: manuscript.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: WillWhere is Mercutio?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (tapping his forehead)
dialog: Locked safe in here. I leave the scene
dialog: in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a
dialog: sonnet to write.
text: WILL moves back into the wings where HENSLOWE is looking
dialog: anxious.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: A sonnet? You mean a play.
text: WILL moves on, ignoring him. As he goes, we see that
text: VIOLA is love-struck by him, a riot in the heart.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. STAIRCASE. DAY.
text: VIOLA still dressed as THOMAS, sonnet in hand, runs up
text: the stairs to her room. From the other end of the house
text: WESSEX can be heard ranting.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. NIGHT.
text: LORD WESSEX is being kept waiting. The NURSE is bearing
text: the brunt of his impatience.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Two hours at prayer!
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at
dialog: prayer is not piety, it is self-
dialog: importance!
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: It would be better that you return
dialog: tomorrow, my lord.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: It would be better that you tell her
dialog: to get off her knees and show some
dialog: civility to her six-day lord and
dialog: master.
text: VIOLA opens the door. She has changed hurriedly--too
text: hurriedly: the effect of her glorious hair falling to her
text: bare shoulders is spoiled by her mustache. Fortunately,
text: the NURSE spots her before WESSEX does and by coming
text: forward to greet her, the NURSE manages to shield Viola
text: from view, communicate the problem, and announce WESSEX'S
text: presence, so that by the time the NURSE has passed by
text: VIOLA and let herself out of the room, the moustache has
dialog: disappeared.
speaker_heading: WESSEX (CONT'D)
dialog: My lady VIOLA.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: I am aware of it, but it is beauty's
dialog: privilege.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: You flatter, my lord.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: No. I have spoken to the Queen.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Her majesty's consent is requisite
text: when a Wessex takes a wife, and once
dialog: gained, her consent is her command.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Do you intend to marry, my lord?
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Your father should keep you better
dialog: informed. He has bought me for you. He
dialog: returns from his estates to see us
dialog: married two weeks from Saturday.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You are allowed to show your pleasure.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: I do not love you, my lord.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: How your mind hops about! Your father
dialog: was a shopkeeper, your children will
dialog: bear arms, and I will recover my
dialog: fortune. That is the only matter under
dialog: discussion today. You will like
dialog: Virginia.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Virginia?!
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Why, yes! My fortune lies in my
dialog: plantations. The tobacco weed. I need
dialog: four thousand pounds to fit out a ship
dialog: and put my investments to work--I fancy
dialog: tobacco has a future. We will not stay
dialog: there long, three or four years . . .
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: But why me?
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: It was your eyes. No, your lips.
text: He kisses her with more passion than ceremony. VIOLA
text: recoils, and slaps him.
speaker_heading: WESSEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Will you defy your father and your
dialog: Queen?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: The Queen has consented?
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: She wants to inspect you. At
dialog: Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive,
text: modest, grateful and brief.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (forced to submit)
dialog: I will do my duty, my lord.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: She is writing to WILL. His letter-poem is on her table.
dialog: We can read part of it. "Shall I compare thee to a
dialog: summer's day"
text: Now we see what VIOLA is writing.
dialog: INSERT: "Master Will, poet dearest to my heart, I beseech
dialog: you, banish me from yours--I am to marry Lord Wessex-- a
dialog: daughter's duty "
text: She sheds a romantic, unhappy tear.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: SAM is now "JULIET." The play has evidently reached Act I
text: Scene 5. We are witnessing the meeting of "ROMEO" and
text: "JULIET" in a simplified version of the changing-partners
text: dance we saw at VIOLA'S house. NED ALLEYN is in charge.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage!
text: The dance goes wrong. it is THOMAS'S fault.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN (CONT'D)
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Gentlemen upstage! Ladies downstage!
dialog: Are you a lady, Mr. Kent?
text: THOMAS mutters a blushing apology. WILL arrives the
text: bystanders, clutching fresh pages. He gives these to
text: PETER. NED ALLEYN sees him and comes over to start an
dialog: argument.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (preempting)
dialog: You did not like the speech?
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: The speech is excellent.
dialog: (he does the first line
dialog: impressively)
dialog: "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been
dialog: with you!" Excellent and a good
text: length. But then he disappears for the
text: length of a bible.
text: WILL points significantly at the pages he has given
speaker_heading: PETER.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: There you have his duel, a skirmish of
dialog: words and swords such as I never
dialog: wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such
dialog: passion and poetry as your ever heard:
dialog: "a plague on both your houses!"
text: NED nods satisfied and turns back to work. Then he turns
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: He dies?
dialog: But the author has escaped.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.
text: Up aloft, WILL has a Writer's Corner where he settle down
text: to work. We see his private superstition: he spins round
text: in a circle, rubs his hands together, and spits on the
text: floor. That done, he picks up his pen.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
text: WILL is charging down a narrow alley, and bumps into
text: BURBAGE who is emerging from the door of a tavern.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Will!
text: WILL is in too much of a hurry to stop. BURBAGE calls
text: after him.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: And where are my pages . . .
text: WILL hurries on.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERBANK. DUSK.
text: VIOLA as THOMAS is being rowed across the river. From
text: behind, in the direction of Bankside, "he" hears
text: shouting.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (O.S. shouting)
dialog: Did you give her my letter?
text: VIOLA as THOMAS turns to see WILL some way behind,
text: following in another boat. She takes a letter from her
text: coat and holds it aloft.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: (calling)
dialog: And this for you.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.
text: WILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open
text: the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He
text: collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I
text: am unmanned, unmended, and unmade,
text: like a puppet in a box.
speaker_heading: BOATMAN
dialog: Writer, is he?
text: WILL turns on him savagely
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Row your boat.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.
text: WILL turns back to VIOLA. They have their conversation
text: intimately, disregarding the lack of intimacy. The
text: BOATMAN is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: She tells me to keep away. She is to
dialog: marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: If you love her, you must do what she
dialog: asks.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: And break her heart and mine?
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: It is only ours you can know.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: She loves me, Thomas!
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: Does she say so?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No. And yet she does where the ink has
dialog: run with tears. Was she weeping when
dialog: she gave you this?
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: I  Her letter came to me by the
dialog: nurse.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Your aunt?
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: (catching up)
dialog: Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a
dialog: little. Tell me how you love her,
dialog: Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Like a sickness and its cure together.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and
dialog: heat.
dialog: (collecting herself)
dialog: Is your lady beautiful? Since I came
dialog: to visit from the country, I have not
dialog: seen her close. Tell me, is she
dialog: beautiful?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh, if I could write the beauty of her
dialog: eyes! I was born to look in them and
dialog: know myself.
text: He is looking into VIOLA'S eyes. She holds his look, but
text: WILL belies his words.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: And her lips?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early
dialog: morning rose would wither on the
dialog: branch, if it could feel envy!
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: And her voice? Like lark song?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Deeper. Softer. None of your
dialog: twittering larks! I would banish
text: nightingales from her garden before
text: they interrupt her song.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: She sings too?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Constantly. Without doubt. And plays
dialog: the lute, she has a natural ear. And
dialog: her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: (glinting)
dialog: What of her bosom?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round
dialog: and rare as golden apples!
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: I think the lady is wise to keep your
dialog: love at a distance. For what lady
dialog: could live up to it close to, when her
text: eyes and lips and voice may be no more
dialog: beautiful than mine? Besides, can a
dialog: lady born to wealth and noble marriage
text: love happily with a Bankside poet and
dialog: player?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (fervently)
dialog: Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of
dialog: rank or riverbank! It will spark
text: between a queen and the poor vagabond
text: who plays the king, and their love
dialog: should be minded by each, for love
dialog: denied blights the soul we owe to God!
dialog: So tell my lady, William Shakespeare
dialog: waits for her in the garden!
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: But what of Lord Wessex?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: For one kiss, I would defy a thousand
dialog: Wessexes!
text: The boat scrapes on the jetty of the DE LESSEPSES' house.
text: The bump throws THOMAS into WILL'S arms. He holds her
text: round the shoulders. His words have almost unmasked her.
text: The closeness does the rest. She kisses him on the mouth
text: and jumps out of the boat.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Oh, Will!
text: She throws a coin to the BOATMAN and runs towards the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: BOATMAN
dialog: Thank you, my lady!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: Lady?
speaker_heading: BOATMAN
dialog: Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she
dialog: was this high. Wouldn't deceive a
dialog: child.
text: WILL gets out of the boat.
speaker_heading: BOATMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (reaching under his seat)
dialog: Strangely enough, I'm a bit of a
dialog: writer myself.
text: The BOATMAN produces his memoirs in manuscript.
speaker_heading: BOATMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It wouldn't take you long to read it,
dialog: I expect you know all the booksellers
dialog: . . .
text: But WILL has gone.
scene_heading: EXT. DE LESSEPSES' GARDEN. NIGHT.
text: WILL drops over the wall into the garden and without
text: hesitation starts climbing up to her balcony.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: WILL comes in through the window, just as VIOLA enters by
text: the door. They stare at each other across the room.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Can you love a fool?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Can you love a player?
text: They run together and fall into a passionate kiss.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (springs back)
dialog: Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps
dialog: as mistook in me as I was mistook in
dialog: Thomas Kent.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Answer me only this: are you the
dialog: author of the plays of William
dialog: Shakespeare?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Then kiss me again for I am not
dialog: mistook.
text: They run together and fall into a passionate kiss. VIOLA
text: fumbles with his clothing, he with hers.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: I do not know how to undress a man.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It is strange to me, too.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: The NURSE has come to listen. She puts her ear against
text: the door. Because she hears muffled voices, she looks
text: startled.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: WILL is half-naked. VIOLA is down to her petticoat, and
text: chemise. The petticoat comes away. WILL flings it aside.
text: He takes off her chemise. He is startled to find that she
text: is tightly bandaged round the bosom. WILL finds the loose
text: end and spins her naked.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: The NURSE, drags a chair--a rocker--outside the bedroom
text: door, and takes up her position. She sits down, keeping
text: guard. Pretty soon there comes the regular creak of
text: VIOLA'S bed. The NURSE fans herself furiously with her
text: little lacy fan. She crosses herself. A CHAMBERMAID comes
text: along the gallery outside the bedroom door. She is
text: dusting her way along. The CHAMBERMAID becomes aware of
text: the regular creaking. She pauses. The NURSE begins to
text: rock in her chair, keeping time with the creaking from
text: within. The CHAMBERMAID stares at the NURSE. The NURSE
text: stares at the CHAMBERMAID.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Go to, go to.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: WILL and VIOLA have finished making love, and lie in each
dialog: other's arms.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: I would not have thought it. There is
dialog: something better than a play.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: There is.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Even your play.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (frowns)
dialog: Oh
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: And that was only my first try.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well perhaps better than my first.
dialog: (he kisses her again)
scene_heading: EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAWN.
text: Dawn is breaking. The sun lacing the severing clouds with
text: envious streaks.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN
text: The NURSE has fallen asleep in her rocking chair.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN.
text: A rooster crows at some distance. VIOLA and WILL are in
text: bed. She stirs drowsily. VIOLA, coming awake, speaks his
text: name and he kisses her.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Will
text: Then he starts to get out of bed.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You would not leave me?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I must. Look-- how pale the window.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (pulling him down)
dialog: Moonlight!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No, the morning rooster woke me.

dialog: It was the owl--come to bed
text: She is winning. She kisses him and pulls the bedclothes
text: around them.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (giving in)
dialog: Oh, let Henslowe wait.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
text: (pausing, pushing him away)
dialog: Mr. Henslowe?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (persisting)

speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Oh--no, no!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (kissing her)
text: There is time. It is still dark.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: It is broad day!
dialog: (the rooster crows again)
dialog: The rooster tells us so!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It was the owl. Believe me, love, it
dialog: was the owl.
text: He kisses her and starts to make love to her again. VIOLA
text: gives him a shove which pushes him onto the floor. She
text: sits up and pulls on her gown.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: You would leave us players without a
dialog: scene to read today?!
text: There's a knock at the door.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VIOLA'S
scene_heading: BEDROOM/VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN.
text: The NURSE is knocking. VIOLA comes to the door.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: My lady, the house is stirring, it is
text: a new day.
text: VIOLA looks beautified by the hours that have passed.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: It is a new world!
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: The cut is to the middle of a rehearsal. We are coming up
text: to the moment when "ROMEO" and "JULIET" kiss for the
text: first time (Act I Scene V) NED ALLEYN is in charge but
text: WILL is watching. His life has turned perfect.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "Have not saints lips, and holy
dialog: palmers too?"
speaker_heading: SAM AS JULIET
dialog: "Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use
dialog: in prayer."
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what
dialog: hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest
dialog: faith turn to despair."
text: WILL is in her eye-line. Her eyes flash an intimate
text: secret look to him.
speaker_heading: SAM AS JULIET
dialog: "Saints do not move, though grant for
dialog: prayer's sake."
text: And VIOLA misses her cue as a result.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (prompting her)
dialog: It's you.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: (roars)
dialog: Suffering cats!
text: VIOLA guiltily picks up her line.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "Then move not, while my prayer's
dialog: effect I take."
text: In character, VIOLA kisses SAM, demurely, but apparently
text: not demurely enough for WILL, who gives a twitch.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO(CONT'D)
dialog: "Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin
dialog: is purg'd."
speaker_heading: SAM AS JULIET
dialog: "Then have my lips the sin that they
dialog: have took."
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly
dialog: urg'd. Give me my sin again."
text: VIOLA kisses SAM again. WILL gives a major twitch, which
text: in fact catapults his body onto the stage. Everybody
text: looks at him in surprise.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yesyesernot quite rightit is more
dialog: let me
speaker_heading: (as JULIET)
dialog: "Then have my lips the sin that they
dialog: have took."
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly
dialog: urg'd. Give me my sin again."
text: VIOLA kisses WILL. They lose themselves for a fraction of
text: a moment. As VIOLA withdraws her lips, WILL'S lips are
dialog: going for it again.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO (CONT'D)
dialog: "You kiss by th' book."
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: (to Will, sarcastically)
dialog: Well! It was lucky you were here! Why
dialog: do not I write the rest of your play
dialog: while you
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (apologising, retreating)
dialog: Yes, yescontinue. Now the Nurse.
dialog: Where is Ralph?
text: RALPH has been ready and waiting.
speaker_heading: RALPH AS NURSE
dialog: "Madam, your mother craves a word with
dialog: you."
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO

speaker_heading: RALPH AS NURSE
dialog: "Marry bachelor, Her mother is the

text: He is behind the curtain now.
speaker_heading: RALPH AS NURSE (O.S.)
dialog: "And a good lady, and wise and
dialog: virtuous. I nurse her daughter that
dialog: you talk'd withal"
text: During RALPH'S lines (which are continuous) WILL stands
text: in the shadow behind the curtain, alone, agitated.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
speaker_heading: RALPH AS NURSE
dialog: "I tell you, he that can lay hold of her (he makes the
dialog: money sign) Shall have the chinks."
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "Is she a Capulet" Oh dear account. My
dialog: life is my foe's debt."
text: NOL, AS "BENVOLIO," at a party, carrying a goblet, tipsy,
text: enters the scene.
speaker_heading: NOL AS BENVOLIO
speaker_heading: (to ROMEO)
dialog: "Away, be gone, the sport is at best."
text: VIOLA, about to make her exit, has her hand holding the

scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.
text: WILL is kissing her hand.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "Ay, so I fear; the more is my

scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.
text: VIOLA comes through the curtain. WILL and VIOLA kiss,
text: dangerously--they are in a narrow space, hidden from the

speaker_heading: SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)
dialog: "Come hither nurse. What is yond
dialog: gentleman?"
speaker_heading: VIOLA

speaker_heading: ALLEYN (O.S.)
dialog: (roaring from the audience)
dialog: Terrible!
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.
text: WILL arrives at the top of the building in his writer's
text: corner. He spins around once in a circle, rubs his hands
text: together and spits on the floor. His manuscript is all
text: over the table.
text: We take a peak at the lines he has already written.
text: INSERT MANUSCRIPT: "But soft, what light through yonder
dialog: window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun."
text: VIOLA'S VOICE OVER speaks the line.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (VO)

dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Arise fair sun and kill the envious

dialog: fair than she"
text: VIOLA is in bed, reading the lines from the manuscript
text: page. WILL is in bed with her, reading with her.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Will!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yes, some of it is speakable.
text: She has to speak through WILL'S kisses, he is nibbling at
text: her neck and shoulders and she has to bat him away with
dialog: the pages.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (continuing reading)
dialog: "It is my lady, O it is my love! O
dialog: that she knew she were!"
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: VIOLA continues the speech, edge-to-edge, now in
text: rehearsal, with SAM as "JULIET" sighing on the balcony
text: above her.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "The brightness of her cheek would
dialog: shame those stars As daylight doth a
dialog: lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through
dialog: the airy region stream so bright That

speaker_heading: VIOLA AS ROMEO
dialog: "By a name I know not how to tell
dialog: thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is
dialog: hateful to myself Because it is an
dialog: enemy to thee"
text: We see that a group of the other actors have drifted "out
text: front," drawn by the scene. FENNYMAN is there entranced.
dialog: Clearly, this stuff is a cut above the normal.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
text: WILL, undressed, strides around the room, feeding
text: "JULIET'S" lines to VIOLA in bed.
speaker_heading: WILL

dialog: (almost to herself)
dialog: "I am feared,

dialog: sweet to be substantial."
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.
text: Onstage, the scene continues. Backstage NED ALLEYN is
text: working his way upstairs. He passes by RALPH (the Nurse)
text: who has a couple of words "of," as it were, in "JULIET'S"
dialog: chamber.
speaker_heading: SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)

speaker_heading: SAM AS JULIET (O.S.)
dialog: By and by I come to cease thy strife

dialog: times good night!"
text: SAM exits (i.e. enters to us) through the curtain.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (to NED)
dialog: I cannot move in this dress! and it
dialog: makes me look like a pig! I have no
dialog: neck in this pig dress!
dialog: (and then hearing his cue
speaker_heading: from "ROMEO")
dialog: Oh, she's off again! She says she's
dialog: going and then she doesn't
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.
text: NED is arriving. WILL is busy writing. PETER is there,
text: holding the pages WILL has completed, and waiting for
text: WILL to finish his page. PETER is reading his pages. WILL
text: sees NED arrive. He gives his page to PETER.
speaker_heading: WILL
speaker_heading: (to PETER)
dialog: How is it?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: It's all right.
text: Typical!, says WILL'S face. Peter departs, leaving the

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: NedI knowI know
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: It's good.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: The title won't do.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Ah
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Thank you, Ned.
text: The whole exchange is in ironic code, between old
text: soldiers. NED nods curtly and turns to descend.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You are a gentleman.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: PETER is just handing the pages HENSLOWE in the
text: auditorium. HENSLOWE has acquired a performing dog. The
text: dog does somersaults tirelessly. As PETER hands over the
text: pages, he shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (in disbelief)
dialog: You mean, no dog of any kind?
text: FENNYMAN, the born-again theatre groupie shushes HENSLOWE
text: and looks daggers at him.
speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: (to HENSLOWE)
text: The Friar married them in secret, then
text: Ned gets into a fight with one of the
text: Capulets, Romeo tries to stop them, he
dialog: gets in Ned's way, I mean in
text: Mercutio's way, so Tybalt kills
text: Mercutio and then Romeo kills Tybalt.
text: Then the Prince banishes him from
dialog: Verona.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (much relieved)
dialog: That must be when he goes on the
text: voyage and gets shipwrecked on the
dialog: island of the Pirate King.
text: FENNYMAN can't hear it. He storms over. Kicks the dog,

speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Cease your prattling! Get out!

dialog: action has paused)
dialog: A thousand apologies!

scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.
text: A sunbeam wakes the lovers. Sunday morning. Church bells.

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Sundayit is Sunday.
text: He brings her back down to the pillow.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I found something in my sleep. The
dialog: Friar who married them will take up
dialog: their destinies.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Oh, but it will end well for love?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy
dialog: I am writing now. A broad river
dialog: divides my lovers--family, duty,
dialog: fate--as unchangeable as nature.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (sobered)
dialog: Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a
dialog: stolen season.
text: Suddenly there is a great racket heard from downstairsa
text: man shouting.
speaker_heading: WESSEX (O.S.)
dialog: Not ready? Where is she?
speaker_heading: NURSE (O.S.)
dialog: Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
speaker_heading: WESSEX (O.S.)
dialog: Will you ask Her Majesty to be
dialog: patient?!
text: VIOLA remembers. She jumps up and gives a cry.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Sunday! Greenwich!
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM.
scene_heading: MORNING.
text: The NURSE is barring the stairs to WESSEX.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Now, pay attention, Nursy. The Queen,
dialog: Gloriana Regina, God's Chosen Vessel,
text: the Radiant One, who shines her light
dialog: on us, is at Greenwich today, and
dialog: prepared, during the evening's
dialog: festivities, to bestow her gracious
dialog: favour on my choice of wife--and if
dialog: we're late for lunch, the old boot
dialog: will not forgive. So you get you to my
dialog: lady's chamber and produce her with or
text: without her undergarments.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.
text: VIOLA has her dress on and is putting on her shoes. WILL,
text: in his underwear is in mid-argument.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: What will you have me do? Marry you
dialog: instead?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (brought up short)
dialog: To be the wife of a poor player?--can I
dialog: wish that for Lady Viola, except in my
dialog: dreams? And yet I would, if I were
dialog: free to follow my desire in the harsh
dialog: light of day.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (tartly)
dialog: You follow your desire freely enough
dialog: in the night. So, if that is all, to
dialog: Greenwich I go.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Then I will go with you.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: You cannot, Wessex will kill you
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I know how to fight!
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (now fixing her hair)
dialog: Stage fighting!
dialog: (turn to him)
dialog: Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart
dialog: belongs to you but as Viola the river
dialog: divides us, and I will marry Wessex a
dialog: week from Saturday.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM
scene_heading: DOWNSTAIRS HALL. MORNING.
text: The ranting from WESSEX has continued
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (ranting)
dialog: By heaven, I will drag her down, by
dialog: the Queen's command
text: And is cut off short as VIOLA'S door opens at the top of
dialog: the stairs.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Good morning, my lord!
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (impressed by her appearance)
dialog: Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no
dialog: man, but I swear it would wait for
dialog: you!
text: VIOLA comes down the stairs. Behind her WILL appears
text: gowned and bonneted. He has also assumed a country
dialog: accent.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Here we come at last, my lord!
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Are you bringing your laundry woman?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Her chaperone. My lady's country
dialog: cousin.
text: (arriving with a curtsey)
dialog: My, but you be a handsome gallant,
dialog: just as she said! You may call me Miss
dialog: Wilhelmina!
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh, my lord, you will not shake me
dialog: off, she never needed me more, I sear
dialog: by your breeches!
scene_heading: EXT. GREENWICH PALACE. NIGHT.
text: Fireworks explode in the evening sky over Greenwich, a
text: royal palace, crowded now with noble guests.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENWICH PALACE. TERRACE. NIGHT.
dialog: The way these royal routs work is that guest mill about,
text: chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while
text: QUEEN ELIZABETH creates a vortex around her as she passes
text: through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with
text: a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the
text: best chairwhere she establishes a headquarters. Her
text: current LORD IN WAITING ferries the lucky few forward to
text: a brief audience with the QUEEN, each giving way to the
text: next. VIOLA and WESSEX are, respectively, dipping and
text: bowing as they are greeted by people who know themWill,
text: in close attendance, joins in gratuitously, bowing until
text: VIOLA nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead. The
text: QUEEN'S LORD IN WAITING plucks WESSEX'S sleeve.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (to him)
dialog: Now?
text: LORD IN WAITING
dialog: Now.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (to Viola)
dialog: The Queen asks for you. Answer well.
text: The LORD IN WAITING ushers VIOLA through the crowd. WILL
text: starts to follow. WESSEX takes him by the arm.
speaker_heading: WESSEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there a man?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: A man, my lord?
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: There was a man, poet--a theatre poet,
dialog: I heard--does he come to the house?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: A theatre poet?
speaker_heading: WESSEX
text: An insolent penny-a-page rogue,
dialog: Marlowe, he said, Christopher
dialog: Marlowe--has he been to the house?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely
text: waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (venomously)
dialog: That dog!
text: ANGLE on the QUEEN.
text: The LORD IN WAITING has presented VIOLA. VIOLA speaks
text: from a frozen curtsey.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Stand up straight, girl.
text: VIOLA straightens. The QUEEN examines her.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I have seen you. You are the one who
dialog: comes to all the plays--at Whitehall,
dialog: at Richmond.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: What do you love so much?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Your Majesty
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Speak out! I know who I am. Do you
dialog: love stories of kings and queens?
dialog: Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: I love theatre. To have stories acted
dialog: for me by a company of fellows is
dialog: indeed
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: They are not acted for you, they are
dialog: acted for me.
text: VIOLA remains silent, in apology.
speaker_heading: ANGLE on WILL.
text: He is watching and listening. He has never seen the QUEEN
text: so close. He is fascinated.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: And--?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: And I love poetry above all.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Above Lord Wessex?
text: She looks over VIOLA'S shoulder and VIOLA realises WESSEX
text: has moved up behind her. WESSEX bows.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (to WESSEX)
dialog: My Lord--when you cannot find your wife
dialog: you had better look for her at the
dialog: playhouse.
text: The COURTIERS titter at her pleasantry.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: But playwrights teach nothing about
dialog: love, they make it pretty, they make
dialog: it comical, or they make it lust. They
dialog: cannot make it true.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (blurts)
dialog: Oh, but they can!
text: She has forgotten herself. The COURTIERS gasp. The QUEEN
text: considers her. WESSEX looks furious. WILL is touched.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they
dialog: have not, but I believe there is one
dialog: who can
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your
dialog: Majesty is wise in it.
dialog: Nature and truth are the very enemies
dialog: of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

text: Titters again. WESSEX could kill somebody.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (by way of dismissing him)
dialog: Well, no one will take your wager, it
dialog: seems.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Fifty pounds!
text: Shock and horror. QUEEN ELIZABETH is the only person
dialog: amused.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a
dialog: very worthy question. Can a play show
dialog: us the very truth and nature of love?
dialog: I bear witness to the wager, and will
dialog: be the judge of it as occasion arises.
dialog: (which wins a scatter of
text: applause. She gathers her
dialog: skirts and stands)
dialog: I have not seen anything to settle it
dialog: yet.
dialog: (she moves away, everybody
dialog: bowing and scraping)
dialog: So--the fireworks will be soothing
dialog: after the excitements of Lady Viola's
dialog: audience.
dialog: (and now she is next to
text: WESSEX who is bowing low.
dialog: Intimately to him)
dialog: Have her then, but you are a lordly
dialog: fool. She has been plucked since I saw
dialog: her last, and not by you. It takes a
dialog: woman to know it.
text: The QUEEN passes by, and as WESSEX comes vertical again,
text: we see his face a mask of furious realisation.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Marlowe!
scene_heading: INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. ENTRANCE. DAY.
text: CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE shuts the door behind him. Above him,
text: the ceiling creaks to the rhythm of copulation. He has a
text: sheaf of manuscript pages in his hand. He goes to the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: Burbage!
text: The creaking stops.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE'S VOICE
dialog: Who's there?
scene_heading: INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. STAIRS. DAY.
text: MARLOWE ascends.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: Marlowe.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE'S VOICE
dialog: Kit!
scene_heading: INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY.
text: MARLOWE enters, ignoring the situation on the bed where
text: ROSALINE is astride BURBAGE.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: You are playing my Faustus this
dialog: afternoon. Don't spend yourself in
dialog: sport.
speaker_heading: ROSALINE
dialog: (working hard)
dialog: This afternoon!--we'll still be here
dialog: this afternoon.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: What do you want, Kit?
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: My Massacre at Paris is complete.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: You have the last act?
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: You have the money?
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: (leaving)
dialog: Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Wait!
speaker_heading: (to ROSALINE)
dialog: Will you desist!
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: Twenty pounds on delivery
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: What is money to me like us? Besides,
dialog: if I need a play, I have another
text: waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Never!
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my
dialog: respects, Miss Rosaline.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for
dialog: Romeo!
speaker_heading: MARLOWE
dialog: (leaving)
dialog: You did. But Ned Alleyn and the
dialog: Admiral's Men have the playing of it
dialog: as the Rose.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Treachery!
text: BURBAGE rouses himself violently, throwing ROSALINE off
text: the bed. The glass bracelet is flung from her wrist. It
text: breaks on the floor, releasing a strip of paper. BURBAGE
text: picks it up. What he reads on it does not please him: it
dialog: is WILL'S signature.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Traitor and thief!
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS. DAY.
text: BURBAGE and a solid wedge of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEND are
text: cleaving a path through the crowds. Their faces are grim.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM/UNDER THE STAGE.
speaker_heading: DAY.
text: We are in Act III Scene I. NED ALLEYN as "MERCUTIO" and
text: NOL as "BENVOLIO", and two "MONTAGUE" sidekicks are in
text: occupation of the stage, when the "CAPULETS" swagger in,
text: four of them headed by JAMES HEMMINGS as "TYBALT."
speaker_heading: NOL AS BENVOLIO
dialog: "By my head, here comes the Capulets."
scene_heading: ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO
dialog: "By my heel, I care not."
text: JAMES HEMMINGS AS TYBALT
dialog: "Follow me close, for I will speak to
text: them. (with bombast to "MERCUTIO")
dialog: Gentlemen, good e'en: a word with one
dialog: of you."
text: NED comes out of character.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: Are you going to do it like that? And
text: before the humbled actor can reply NED
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN (AS MECUTIO)
dialog: And but one word with one of us?
dialog: Couple it with something, make it a
text: word and a blow.
text: But suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage,
text: ready to fight. BURBAGE and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN have
text: arrived to avenge BURBAGE'S honour with swords, clubs,
text: and a bucket (containing pig swill).
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Where is that thieving hack who can't
dialog: keep his pen in his own ink pot!?
text: WILL has already leapt up onto the stage.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What is this rabble?!
text: BURBAGE aims a blow at WILL, who ducks and grabs a stave
text: from the nearest actor, and parries the blow.
text: He swings at BURBAGE, a CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN swings at WILL,
text: THOMAS cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings
text: bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ADMIRAL'S
text: MEN and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, using their much rehearsed
text: skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using
text: everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. CRAB, the dog, is
text: yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. HENSLOWE,
text: a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the
text: page in his hand. FENNYMAN, much slower to catch up,
text: watches enthralled.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
speaker_heading: (to HENSLOWE)
dialog: Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog!
dialog: But now HENSLOWE has worked out that these actors don't
text: belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his
text: interest is protecting his property. Big burly RALPH is
text: using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one
text: of them over an enemy's back and HENSLOWE turns on RALPH
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Not with my props!
text: VIOLA is doing well enough, tripping up an enemy with a
text: well-judged stave, and then using it to deflect a blow
speaker_heading: aimed at WILL
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Will! What--?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: A literary feud. Quite normal.
text: Then he is smashed over the head. He falls off the stage
text: taking VIOLA with him. Under the stage is a space (known
text: as Hell) and WILL shoves VIOLA into this space.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Stay hid!
text: He gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are
text: worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined,
text: with SAM GOSSE, dressed as "JULIET," fighting with the
text: best of them. There is a stack of cushions, stored for
text: the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, NED
text: ALLEYN and others grab cushions to use as shields. Soon
text: cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying
text: feathers. The trap door in the stage opens, VIOLA'S head
text: pops up. She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs
text: and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and
text: half knocks her wig off. In danger of having her cover
text: blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just
text: nicely for Will to plummet down it.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I dreamed last night of a shipwreck.
dialog: You were cast ashore in a far country.
text: They embrace and kiss. In a moment they are in a world of
dialog: their own.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.
text: The battle rages. FENNYMAN, alone now in the auditorium,
text: continues to watch entranced. It's the greatest show he's
text: ever seen. HENSLOWE is desperately trying to rescue odd
text: props that have been seconded to the fight. Someone picks
text: up a tree that is to be used in Romeo. HENSLOWE yells.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: We need that for the balcony scene!
text: FENNYMAN notices this, and it rings a distant bell. He
text: looks around the realises that some of these faces are
text: unfamiliar. The tree comes crashing down on RALPH'S head.
text: FENNYMAN looks at HENSLOWE.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
dialog: (in despair)
dialog: My poor Rose!
text: He collapses on to a broken bench. FENNYMAN comes over to
text: him, grabs the script pages from his pocket, and consults
text: them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect: that
text: this scene is not in them.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: My investment! LAMBERT!!!
text: LAMBERT has been sleeping peacefully through this, but
text: wakes to his master's call.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (points at the fray)
speaker_heading: VENGEANCE!
text: HENSLOWE attempts to intervene.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman.
dialog: As I explained to you, the theatre
dialog: business
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my
dialog: business I would be out of business if
dialog: I had your courage, so don't tell me
dialog: about business
text: And he delivers a telling blow to a passing CHAMBERLAIN'S
text: MAN, who wheels off the stage. LAMBERT meanwhile is
text: making short work of the rest of the opposition,
dialog: receiving help with the thorny business of identification
text: from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are
text: running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic
text: last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage
text: and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts
text: applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start
text: applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN
text: looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and
text: bravos engulf him. A star!
scene_heading: INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.
text: The victorious army of actors bursts into the brothel,
text: FENNYMAN at their head. He owns the brothel. The place is
text: already crowded with WHORES and CUSTOMERS. It's a party.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: A famous victory! Kegs and legs. Open
dialog: and on the house! Oh what happy hour!
text: (and grabbing a RADDLED
speaker_heading: WHORE)
dialog: Poxy Pol! You keep yourself to
dialog: yourself I'll not have you infecting
dialog: my investment!
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: (looking around guardedly. To
speaker_heading: WILL)
dialog: Is this a tavern?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: It is also a tavern.
text: WILL sits her down in THE COMPANY and takes the chair
text: next to her A PRETTY WHORE immediately sits on WILL'S
text: knee and kisses him.
speaker_heading: PRETTY WHORE
dialog: I remember you! The poet!
text: VIOLA furiously pulls the PRETTY WHORE off WILL'S lap.
speaker_heading: PRETTY WHORE (CONT'D)
dialog: One at a time, one at a time!
speaker_heading: SECOND WHORE
speaker_heading: (to VIOLA)
dialog: Oh, he's a pretty one! Tell me your
dialog: story while I tickle your fancy!
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill-
dialog: repute!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.
dialog: Come, there is no harm in a drink.
text: Glasses are shoved into their hands. Everyone has a
dialog: glass. Except RALPH
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: (declining the glass)
dialog: Never when I'm working!
text: The PRETTY WHORE has turned her attention to SAM. SAM
dialog: looks uncomfortable
speaker_heading: PRETTY WHORE
dialog: Never tried it? Never?
dialog: (groping him)
dialog: I think you are ready, Sam!
text: FENNYMAN shouts a toast.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: (raising his glass)
dialog: You are welcome to my best house!
dialog: Here's to the Admiral's Men!
text: Everybody drinks. VIOLA drinks too. She decides too. She
text: decides to enjoy it. She bangs down her glass.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: The Admiral's Men!
text: WILL toasts with her. He sees that she feels one of THE
speaker_heading: COMPANY.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NIGHT.
text: A figure is running desperately through the streets. He
text: comes into the square and runs towards the Rose.
scene_heading: EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.
text: Half THE COMPANY are singing. NOL and a WHORE are
text: tumbling down the stairs together. He is without his
text: trousers. An awful lot of drink has gone down.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (to the PRETTIEST WHORE)
dialog: Iquite liked it.
text: VIOLA, bright eyed, is banging her glass on the table in
text: time to a song which is being drunkenly delivered by a
text: barbershop quartet of actors.
text: FENNYMAN reels into VIOLA.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Master Kent! You have not dipped your
dialog: wick?
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS THOMAS
dialog: (baffled)
dialog: My wick?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (saving her)
dialog: Mr. Fennyman, because you love the
dialog: theatre you must have a part in my
dialog: play. I am writing an Apothecary, a
dialog: small but vital role.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: (embracing WILL)
dialog: By heaven, I thank you! I will be your
dialog: Apothecary!
text: In his general enthusiasm, he embraces the next man, who
text: is RALPH, stone cold sober.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I am to be in your play.
speaker_heading: WHORE
speaker_heading: (to RALPH)
dialog: And what is this play about?
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Well, there's this Nurse
text: FENNYMAN, beside himself, shouts for silence, announcing
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part
dialog: of the Apothecary!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: The Apothecary? Will, what is the
dialog: story? Where is the shipwreck? How
dialog: does the comedy end?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: By God, I wish I knew.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: By God, Will, if you do not, who does?
dialog: Let us have pirates, clowns, and a
dialog: happy ending, or we will send you back
dialog: to Stratford to your wife!
text: That goes down every well with the entire COMPANYexcept
text: for VIOLA and WILL. He looks at her, helplessly, then
text: makes as if to say something. VIOLA ducks away from him
text: and blunders blindly out of the street door, in tears.
text: VIOLA passes PETER who is coming in from the street.
text: WILL, attempting to follow VIOLA, is grabbed round the
text: shoulders by PETERwho, we now see, is in a highly
text: emotional state. WILL tries to fight him off but PETER
dialog: has the strength of the news he brings.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!
text: He brings the room to silence.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: A black day for us all! There is news
dialog: come up river from Deptford. Marlowe
text: is dead.
text: There are general gasps and cries for information.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
text: Stabbed! Stabbed to death in a tavern
dialog: at Deptford!
text: No one is more affected than WILL. This second blow is
text: worse than the first. He stands horror-stricken.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Ohwhat have I done?
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: He was the first man among us. A great
text: light has gone out.
scene_heading: EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.
text: WILL comes staggering out into the street.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It was I who killed him! God forgive
dialog: me, God forgive me!
text: He falls into a stagnant puddle, a deep gutter of water
text: and garbage. He gets up and staggers on.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH TOWER. NIGHT.
text: A church tower looms up in the night sky.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH. NIGHT.
text: This is where WILL has come. The church is empty, but for
text: the demented, grieving figure of SHAKESPEARE, kneeling,
text: praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private
text: purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by
text: effigies of the dead and images of his Redeemer. He is
text: wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair.
scene_heading: EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.
text: A lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing.
text: VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides
text: sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather
text: like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive
dialog: animal.
text: Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a
text: happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily.
text: Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA
text: and greets her merrily.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: You look sad, my lady! Let me take you
dialog: riding.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: It is not my riding day, my lord.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: I am going to church.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (recomposing his features to
dialog: solemnity)
dialog: I understand of course. It is to be
dialog: expected.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: It is to be expected on a Sunday.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: And on a day of mourning. I never met
dialog: the fellow but once at your house.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (cannot take this in)
dialog: Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would
dialog: be me to tell you. A great loss to
dialog: playwriting, and to dancing.
text: VIOLA almost faints. The NURSE steadies her.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (faintly)
dialog: He is dead?
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (cheerfully solemn)
dialog: Killed last night, in a tavern! Come,
dialog: then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
text: VIOLA gives a silent cry. The NURSE is speaking to her in
dialog: distress.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: My ladymy ladynow is the time to
dialog: show your breeding.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH. DAY.
text: The NURSE is holding VIOLA up as they enter the church.
text: VIOLA seems catatonic. The NURSE lowers her onto a seat
text: and sits down next to her.
text: As they sit, the CHOIR enters singing. WESSEX, who is
text: sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest.
text: He hasn't been in a church for years. What he sees turns
text: him to jelly. He sees WILL SHAKESPEARE.
speaker_heading: ANGLE on WILL.
text: WILL is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great
text: shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of
text: times, and this is the worst. Bleeding from where he has
text: banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he
text: stands in a side chapel staring at WESSEX.
text: WESSEX gasps and sweats, and sees WILL raise a quivering
text: accusatory finger at him. WESSEX cracks. He starts to
text: mumble.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for
dialog: the love of Christ!
text: Now VIOLA sees WILL. She is still paralysed, and seems at
text: first unable to take him in. She watches with detachment
text: as WESSEX starts to back out of the church, finally
text: running in terror.
speaker_heading: WESSEX (CONT'D)
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Spare me!
text: The CHOIR continues to sing, but the scream brings VIOLA
text: to her senses and she runs to a side door where WILL is
dialog: leaving.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH. DAY.
text: Outside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the
text: church. She calls his name.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Will!
text: He does not answer. She runs after him.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, my love, I thought you were dead!
text: She claps him to her. They told each other for a moment
text: then WILL pulls back.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It is worse. I have killed a man.
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW. DAY.
text: VIOLA'S horse grazes. WILL lies on his back, still
text: sobered and full of guilt. VIOLA sits on the grass among
text: the buttercups and looks down at him.
text: VIOLA is plaiting a finger-ring from stems of grass. She
text: has not yet revealed her feelings.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Marlowe's touch was in my Titus
dialog: Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house
text: built on his foundations.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: You never spoke so well of him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: He was not dead before. I would
dialog: exchange all my plays to come for all
dialog: of his that will never come.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: You lie.
text: WILL turns to look at her.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You lie in your meadow as you lied in
dialog: my bed.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes,
dialog: and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir
dialog: Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife
dialog: come from Stratford to tell you that.
dialog: And yet you let me come to your bed.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Calf love. I loved the writer, and
text: gave up the prize for a sonnet.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I was the more deceived.
speaker_heading: VOILA
dialog: Yes--you were deceived. For I never
dialog: loved you till now.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (declaring herself)
dialog: I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh, my love
dialog: (he kisses her)
dialog: You ran from me before.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: You were not dead before. When I
dialog: thought you dead, I did not care about
dialog: all the plays that will never come,
dialog: only that I would never see your face.
dialog: I saw our end, and it will come.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You cannot marry Wessex!
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: If not Wessex the Queen will know the
dialog: cause and there will be no more Will
dialog: Shakespeare.
text: They kiss again, passionately.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Nono.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (through his kisses)
dialog: But I will go to Wessex as a widow
dialog: from these vows, as solemn as they are
text: unsanctified.
text: And as their desperate kisses turn into lovemaking we cut
dialog: to:
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (he is mid speech)
dialog: For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt,
dialog: the one who killed Romeo's friend
dialog: Mercutio, Romeo is banished
text: He is on the stage of the Rose. The entire COMPANY is
text: assembled, HENSLOWE and FENNYMAN included, holding pages
text: of manuscript, which they are sharing together, examining
text: the separated pages, passing pages to each other, etc.
text: WILL'S mood is intense and focused.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: but the Friar who married Romeo and
dialog: Juliet
speaker_heading: ACTOR (EDWARD)
dialog: Is that me. Will?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You, Edward. The Friar who married
text: them gives Juliet a potion to drink.
text: It is a secret potion. It makes her
text: seeming dead. She is placed in the
text: tomb of the Capulets. She will awake
dialog: to life and love when Romeo comes to
text: her side again.
text: THE COMPANY murmurs approval.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I have not said all. By malign fate,
dialog: the message goes astray which would
text: tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He
dialog: hears only that Juliet is dead. And
text: thus he goes to the Apothecary.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: That's me.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: And buys a deadly poison. He enters
dialog: the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who
text: lies there cold as death. He drinks
text: the poison. He dies by her side. And
text: then she wakes and sees him dead.
text: HENSLOWE is fascinated and appalled.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
text: And so Juliet takes his dagger and
dialog: kills herself.
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
text: WILL is staring at VIOLA
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Well, that will have them rolling in
text: the aisles.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Sad and wonderful! I have a blue
dialog: velvet cap which will do well, I have
text: seen apothecary with a cap just so.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
speaker_heading: (to WILL)
dialog: Yes--it will serve. But there's a scene
text: missing between marriage and death.
text: WILL is still staring at VIOLA. Aware, suddenly, of the
text: others watching, she breaks his gaze and drops her head.
text: WILL looks at NED.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.
text: WILL and VIOLA. VIOLA dressed as THOMAS. He has present
text: for her--a neatly written manuscript of his play, on
text: sheets folded to octavo size.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The play. All written out for you. I
dialog: had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he
dialog: has a good fist for lettering.
text: She wants to accept the present with joy, but something
text: in his mood restrains her.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: There's a new scene
text: He turns the pages and shows her.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Will you read it for me?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (he knows it)
dialog: "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near
dialog: day&gt; It was the nightingale and not
dialog: the lark That pierced the fearful
text: hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings
dialog: on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me,
dialog: love, it was the nightingale."
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "It was the lark, the herald of the
dialog: morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what
text: envious streaks Do lace the severing
text: clouds in yonder east. Night's candles
dialog: are burnt out, and jocund day Stands
text: tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I
dialog: must be gone and live, or stay and
dialog: die."
text: The words of the scene become WILL'S and VIOLA'S, their
text: way of saying the farewells they cannot utter.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: "Yon light is not daylight, I know it,
dialog: I. It is some meteor that the sun
dialog: exhales To be to thee this night a
dialog: torchbearer"
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.
text: But the scene is continuing with VIOLA dressed as
text: "THOMAS." Somewhere behind and up above the stage, in a
text: deserted corner among rigging, bits of scenery, etc.,
dialog: they speak the lines and we hardly know ourselves whether
text: it is rehearsal or lovemaking. But after a few moments it
text: is definitely lovemaking. Their clothes start coming
text: away, their words interrupted by kisses.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: "thou need'st not to be gone."
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: "I have more care to stay than will to
dialog: go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet
dialog: wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's
dialog: talk. It is not day."
text: By now, her loosened bosom-bandage has been pulled away
text: and WILL passionately embraces her nakedness.
text: And into this heaving composition comes a little white
text: mouse, unseen my them, climbing through a knot hole in
text: the planking behind VIOLA'S head.
text: An adjacent knot hole reveals a human eye and we do not
dialog: need to be told it is JOHN WEBSTER'S.
text: WEBSTER takes his eye away from the peephole, and frowns,
text: thinking it out.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEWAY. DAY.
text: TILNEY puts a coin in WEBSTER'S hand.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: You will go far, I fear.
speaker_heading: TILNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope we work together again. Tilney
text: walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.
text: A man is pacing up and down, in a sort of agony. He is
text: muttering. He is glancing at a sheet of paper. He is
text: FENNYMAN rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary,
dialog: for which he has a special voice.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's
dialog: law Is death to any he that utters
dialog: them." Then him. Then me.
dialog: "Put this in any liquid thing you will And"--something
text: He has dried up. He curses--the terror and despair.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: "Such mortal drugs I have" What is
dialog: it? What is it?
text: He is so wrapped up in all this that he simply does not
text: notice when WESSEX rides up to the main entrance
text: dismounts and walks inside.
scene_heading: INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: Onstage, the rehearsal continues. WESSEX strides in.
text: Among the audience are HENSLOWE, a few actorsand JOHN
text: WEBSTERwho sees WESSEX and jumps up and goes to him.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: My lord!
text: WESSEX knocks him aside and continues.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Shakespeare!
text: Everything stops.
speaker_heading: WESSEX (CONT'D)
dialog: You upstart inky pup! Now I will show
dialog: you your place, which is in hell!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You are on my ground.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (drawing his sword)
dialog: By God, I'll fight the lot of you
text: WILL draws his sword.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I am more than enough.
text: VIOLA reacts. She almost gives herself away. But the
dialog: fight has started.
text: WESSEX slashes at WILL. WILL knows how to fight. He
text: parries and thrusts. WESSEX is surprised. The fight goes
text: fast and furious around the stage, until WILL thrusts
text: accurately at WESSEX'S chestand would have killed him
text: but for the button on his sword-point.
text: WESSEX grapples with him, and now it becomes a parody of
text: the Hamlet duel; WESSEX'S unbuttoned sword falls to the
text: ground, WILL puts his foot on it, tosses WESSEX his own
text: safe sword, picks up Wessex's sword and continues the
text: fight until he has WESSEX at his mercy.
text: WILL has fought with a passionate rage that has everybody
text: staring at him. Now the look in his eyes is merciless.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Absent friends!
dialog: (to the assembly)
dialog: This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!
text: NED ALLEYN comes forward looking worried and dubious.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: Will
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: I rejoiced at his death because I
dialog: thought it was yours. That is all I
dialog: know of Marlowe.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: It's true, Will--it was a tavern
dialog: brawlMarlowe attacked, and got his
text: own knife in the eye. A quarrel about
dialog: the bill
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: The bill! Oh, vanity, vanity!
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: Not the billing, the bill!
text: WILL steps back, and sinks to his knees. His relief could
dialog: not be greater.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (to the heavens)
dialog: Oh God, I am free of it!
text: WESSEX gets to his feet. TILNEY enters the auditorium
text: from the public entrance.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Close it!
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: My Lord Wessex!
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (foaming)
dialog: Close it! Take it down stone by stone!
dialog: I want it ploughed into the ground,
dialog: and sown with quick lime!
text: WESSEX storms out past the bewildered TILNEY.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Mr. Tilney, what is this?
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: Sedition and indecency!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: Master of the Revels, sir, over here,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
speaker_heading: (to WEBSTER)
dialog: Where, boy?
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: (points)
dialog: I saw her bubbies!
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: (shocked and gratified)
dialog: A woman on the stage? A woman?
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: I swear it!
text: THE COMPANY of actors are dumbstruck. None more than
speaker_heading: VIOLA.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: So, Henslowe! I say this theatre is
dialog: closed! On the authority of the powers
dialog: invested in my by the court--I close
dialog: this theatre!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Why so?
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: (triumphantly)
dialog: For lewdness and unshamefacedness! For
text: displaying a female on the public
dialog: stage!
text: TILNEY is unstoppable. He jumps on the stageand seizes
text: SAM GOSSE. Before WEBSTER or anyone can intervene, TILNEY
text: pulls up his skirt, ignoring SAM'S rather gutteral yell
text: of protest and pulls down SAM'S drawers.
text: TILNEY'S face is a study. So is everybody else's. WEBSTER
text: rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly
text: throws one of his mice onto "ROMEO'S" hair. VIOLA gives a
text: shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via
text: VIOLA'S ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. By which
text: time VIOLA has gone berserk and torn off her wig. Her
text: hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender.
text: WILL is paralysed. VIOLA gives him a look of terrible
text: despair and apology.
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: (pointing at SAM)
dialog: Not him.
dialog: (pointing at VIOLA)
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: He's a woman!
text: By now the scene is playing to a crowded theatre, or so
dialog: it seems.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: That's who I meant! This theatre is
dialog: closed! Notice will be posted!
text: SAM has picked himself up, and his drawers.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (to NED)
dialog: Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (hoping to protect WILL)
dialog: Nobody knew!
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: (pointing at WILL)
dialog: He did! I saw him kissing her bubbies!
text: Everybody looks at WILL, who stares at VIOLA, helpless.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: Closed! Closed, mark you, Henslowe!
text: TILNEY turns on his heel and leaves in triumph. THE
text: COMPANY is still polaxed.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (in despair)
text: It is over.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted
dialog: to be an actor.
dialog: (she turns to WILL)
dialog: I am sorry, Will.
text: WILL shakes his head. This cannot be the end. VIOLA walks
text: away, leaving by the public entrance. They all let her
text: go, watching her silently. As she passes WABASH
speaker_heading: WABASH
dialog: Y-y-y-you w-w-w-were w-w-w-w-
dialog: wonderful.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Thank you.
text: As she is leaving, WILL comes to life. He starts off
text: towards herbut his progress is halted by a sock to the
text: jaw from NED ALLEYN. WILL falls down in the dust.
text: FENNYMAN enters, still bent over his sheet of paper,
text: mumbling his precious lines. When he reaches the
text: groundlings yard, he finds to his surprise the whole
text: COMPANY is standing about in attitudes of despair or
text: worse. FENNYMAN looks around.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Everything all right?
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. EVENING.
text: The closure notice is nailed to the door.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.
text: VIOLA, in her nightdress, is reading by candlelight. She
text: is reading her private manuscript of Romeo and Julietand
text: rereading. Next to her is a tray of covered dishes. the
text: NURSE enters and looks at her sympathetically. She lifts
text: the tray. She realises it is heavy. She puts it down and
text: raises the covers and sees that VIOLA has eaten nothing.
text: She looks at VIOLA'S tears, but there is nothing to be
dialog: said.
scene_heading: INT. TAVERN. DAY.
text: They are all there--the ADMIRAL'S MEN, including WILL and
text: HENSLOWE, drowning their sorrows. Everyone is drunk.
text: FENNYMAN is also there, taking the disaster somewhat
dialog: selfishly.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: I would have been goodI would have
dialog: been great.
text: He hands a flask to RALPH who is in a similar mood.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: So would I. We both would.
text: RALPH contemplates the flask, and, since he's not
text: working, takes a swig. A moment later, he keels over,
text: rigid as a pole. The street door crashes open. BURBAGE
text: enters. Behind him enter a solid wedge of the
text: CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, sober-faced, several with black eyes
text: and bandages round their heads.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Lambert!
text: LAMBERT, FENNYMAN'S henchman and killer, puts down his
text: tankard and comes forward, casually kicking chairs and
text: tables out of his way.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Kill him!
text: LAMBERT reaches up to the wall over the bar and takes
text: down once of the ceremonial weapons hanging there--a
text: battle-axe.
text: But BURBAGE has flintlock pistol stuck into his sash.
text: BURBAGE draws and the pistol roars, shooting flame,
text: LAMBERT curses, drops the axe, nurses his wounded hand.
text: BURBAGE puts the pistol back into his sash. NED ALLEYN is
text: half-drunk at a table. He staggers to his feet. He faces
speaker_heading: BURBAGE.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: Well, Burbage--you never did know when
dialog: your scene was over.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: That can wait. The Master of the
dialog: Revels despises us for vagrants,
text: tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But
dialog: my father, James Burbage, had the
dialog: first licence to make a company of
dialog: players from Her Majesty, and he drew
dialog: from poets the literature of the age.
dialog: Their fame will be our fame. So let
dialog: them all know, we are men of parts. We
dialog: are a brotherhood, and we will be a
dialog: profession. Will Shakespeare has a
dialog: play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is
dialog: yours.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.
text: A strong wind is blowing through the trees. A BOY with a
text: paste-pot and a bundle of flyers, is having trouble
text: pasting a flyer on the wall of the building. A gust of
text: wind scatters the bundle and sends a couple of dozen
text: flyers flying into the sky. The BOY with the paste-pot
text: runs around, trying to recover those he can. We look at
dialog: the poster. It says
scene_heading: BY PERMISSION OF
speaker_heading: MR. BURBAGE
dialog: A
scene_heading: HUGH FENNYMAN PRODUCTION
speaker_heading: OF
scene_heading: MR. HENSLOWE'S PRESENTATION
speaker_heading: OF
scene_heading: THE ADMIRAL'S MEN IN PERFORMANCE
speaker_heading: OF
scene_heading: THE EXCELLENT AND LAMENTABLE TRAGEDY
speaker_heading: OF
scene_heading: ROMEO AND JULIET
text: with Mr. Fennyman as the Apothecary
text: WILL comes out of the theatre, and passes the poster. He
text: walks on without looking at it. A voice calls after him:
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Will!
text: WILL does not turn to look at him.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll be needing a Romeo
text: WILL carries on walking.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS. DAY.
text: WILL is pushing through the crowds on his way to the
dialog: river.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY.
text: The NURSE is helping VIOLA to dress--in a wedding dress.
text: The NURSE is in tears. VIOLA submits to the task
text: impassively.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.
text: WILL is climbing down the ladder to the waiting boats.
scene_heading: INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. DAY.
text: WESSEX, dressed to be a bridegroom is concluding his
text: negotiations with DE LESSEPS, while LADY DE LESSEPS
text: weeps. DE LESSEPS is signing papers. There is a money
text: chest, too.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: My ship is moored at Bankside, bound
dialog: for Virginia on the afternoon
dialog: tide--please do not weep, Lady De
dialog: Lesseps, you are gaining a colony.
speaker_heading: DE LESSEPS
dialog: And you are gaining five thousand
dialog: pounds, my lordby these drafts in my
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Would you oblige me with fifty or so
dialog: in gold?--just to settle my accounts at
dialog: the dockside?
text: DE LESSEPS sighs and unlocks his money chest. WESSEX
text: places his empty purse on the desk.
speaker_heading: WESSEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah!--Look, she comes!
text: VIOLA has appeared at the top of the stairs with the
speaker_heading: NURSE.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Good morning, my lord. I see you are
dialog: open for business so let's to church.
scene_heading: EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.
text: WILL is running across the grass towards the house. As he
text: crosses the bridge over the moat, a carriage bears down
text: on him, and he has to flatten himself against the wall of
text: the gatehouse as the carriage passes, taking WESSEX and
text: his bride to church. WILL'S face, as he watches the
text: carriage disappear. Distant bells begin to peal
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH DOOR. DAY.
text: The bells announce the completion of the marriage--as
text: WESSEX and the new LADY WESSEX leave the church. VIOLA'S
text: veil is flying in the wind, and beneath it we can just
text: see VIOLA'S unhappy face. The DE LESSEPS FAMILY entourage
text: is applauding. WESSEX beams with satisfaction.
text: Suddenly the sky and the wind deliver a message--a flyer
text: from the Curtain slaps against WESSEX'S face. He claws at
text: it and tries to throw it away. The wind delivers it to
text: VIOLA'S bosom. She takes it up and reads it. And passes
dialog: it to the NURSE.
text: WESSEX descends the steps to where the curtained carriage
text: awaits the bride and groom. He gallantly holds the door
text: for VIOLA to enter. She climbs aboard. WESSEX makes to
dialog: follow her.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: My lord!
text: The NURSE grasps him in a moving embrace, to WESSEX'S
dialog: discomfort.
speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Be good to her, my lord!
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: I will.
text: He tries to disengage. She won't have it.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: God bless you!
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Thank you. Let go, there's a good
dialog: nurse.
text: After a couple of further attempts, WESSEX extricates
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: WESSEX (CONT'D)
dialog: The tide will not wait. Farewell!
text: WESSEX pulls aside the curtain and gets in.
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE. DAY.
text: It takes a moment for WESSEX to realise he is alone in
text: there. He looks around but VIOLA has fled.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.
text: Hundreds of people are converging on the theatre. Among
text: them is the Puritan MAKEPEACE, vainly exhorting the
dialog: crowds to run away from sin
speaker_heading: MAKEPEACE
dialog: Licentiousness is made a show, vice is
dialog: made a show, vanity and pride likewise
dialog: made a show! This is the very business
dialog: of show
text: But MAKEPEACE is being carried inexorably through the
text: main doors of the theatre.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.
text: The ADMIRAL'S MEN are all in costume, and are in a buzz
text: of nervous excitement. ALLEYN, dressed for "MERCUTIO," is
text: giving last minute instructions to PETER. JAMES and JOHN
text: HEMMINGS are arguing about the timing of their entrance.
text: FENNYMAN in his apothecary's cap is agonising over his
text: lines. WABASH is stuttering over his. Alone in his
text: dejection in the midst of all this, is WILL, dressed for
dialog: "ROMEO."
text: FENNYMAN approaches him, apothecary's
text: cap in hand.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: Is this all right?
text: WILL nods, miserable. SAM has found a private corner. He
text: is gargling into a basin. He looks worried and furtive.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: The audience is gathering.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.
dialog: Word has got around. Even rich people are coming. They
text: arrive by carriage and by palanquin.
text: Some of them are cloaked and hooded, slumming incognito.
text: A cannon booms from the Curtain. The flag of the
text: ADMIRAL'S MEN flutters above.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. ENTRANCE. DAY.
text: LAMBERT and FREES are taking the entrance money.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: The auditorium is now packed. Among them, sheepish, is
text: MAKEPEACE.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.
text: Everything is ready. NED signals the musicians. Trumpets
text: and drums sound. The house falls silent.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.
dialog: WABASH seems to be important at the beginning. We have
text: never been told what part he plays. He is still muttering
text: lines and stuttering them.
speaker_heading: WABASH
dialog: (mutter)
dialog: T-t-t-two h-h-households b-both alike
dialog: in d-d-d-dignity.
text: WILL listens to him in agony. He finds HENSLOWE next to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: WILL
speaker_heading: (to HENSLOWE)
dialog: We are lost.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: No, it will turn out well.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: How will it?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: I don't know, it's a mystery.
text: And off we go. HENSLOWE claps WABASH on the shoulder and
text: sends him through the curtain.
speaker_heading: ANGLE on WABASH
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: The audience waits expectantly. WABASH gathers himself.
scene_heading: WABASH AS THE CHORUS
dialog: T-t-t-t-two
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.
text: WILL shuts his eyes and prays.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: WABASH launches himself into a perfect audacious delivery
text: like a star.
scene_heading: WABASH AS THE CHORUS
dialog: "Household both alike in dignity (in
dialog: fair Verona where we lay our scene)
dialog: From ancient grudge break to new
dialog: mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil
dialog: hands unclean. From forth the fatal
dialog: loins of these two foes A pair of star-
dialog: cross'd lovers take their life, Whose
text: misadventured piteous overthrows Doth
dialog: with their death bury their parents'
dialog: strife"
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY.
text: VIOLA and the NURSE, hurrying toward the Curtain.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.
text: HEMMINGS BROTHERS are ready to go on as "SAMPSON" and
text: "GROCERY," Act I Scene I. They shake hands. Beyond the
text: curtain, the audience applauds the Prologue as WABASH
text: comes through the curtain backstage.
speaker_heading: WILL
speaker_heading: (to WABASH)
dialog: Wonderful!
speaker_heading: WABASH
dialog: W-w-w-was it g-g-g-good?
text: The HEMMINGS BROTHERS enter the arena and the play
text: begins.
speaker_heading: POV: from THE WINGS:
scene_heading: JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON
dialog: "Gregory, on my word we'll not carry
dialog: coals."
scene_heading: JAMES HEMMINGS AS GREGORY
dialog: "No, for then we should be colliers."
text: WILL looks as if he would rather be
text: dead. SAM GOSSE approaches WILL,
dialog: nervously.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (nervously--in a deep bass
text: guttural hoarse voice)
dialog: Master Shakespeare
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (absently)
dialog: Luck be with you, Sam.
dialog: (as the awful truth gets
dialog: through to him)
dialog: Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (in the same voice)
dialog: It is not my fault, Master
dialog: Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (the effect is horrible)
dialog: "Parting is such sweet sorrow"
text: HENSLOWE has been overhearing.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Another little problem.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What do we do now?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: The show must  you know
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Juliet does not come on for twenty
dialog: pages. It will be all right.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: How will it?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: I don't know. It's a mystery.
text: And he makes his way towards the front of the house.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. DAY.
text: A furious WESSEX is hurrying along the road to the
dialog: theatre.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.
text: VIOLA and the NURSE are arriving, and looking for a seat
text: in the gallery. BURBAGE and his MEN are standing at the
text: back, behind the people seated in the gallery. The first
text: scene of the play is continuing
speaker_heading: ARMITAGE AS ABRAM
dialog: "Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
scene_heading: JOHN HEMMINGS AS SAMPSON
dialog: "I do bite my thumb, sir."
text: BURBAGE finds HENSLOWE plucking agitatedly at his sleeve.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Can we talk?
text: They are standing behind the back row of the gallery
text: seats. The spectator in front of them is the NURSE. She
text: turns round and shushes HENSLOWE up.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering to BURBAGE)
dialog: We have no Juliet!
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: (forgetting to whisper)
dialog: No Juliet?!
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (turning)
dialog: No Juliet?!
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: it will be all right, madam.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: What happened to Sam?
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Thomas Kent!
text: Their whispers are causing black looks and hushing noises
text: from the neighbours. HENSLOWE pulls VIOLA from her seat,
text: luckily an aisle seat.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: Do you know it?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (showing the manuscript)
dialog: Every word.
text: HENSLOWE and BURBAGE look at each other. CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
scene_heading: PHILIP AS LADY CAPULET
dialog: "Nurse, where is my daughter? Call her
dialog: forth to me."
speaker_heading: RALPH AS NURSE

dialog: old, I bade her come. What, lamb. What
dialog: ladybird."
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS/STAGE. DAY.
text: SAM who gathers himself, to make his entrance, quietly
text: and horribly practising "How now, who calls?"
speaker_heading: RALPH AS NURSE
dialog: (on stage)
dialog: "God forbid. Where's this girl?
text: The author and star, WILL SHAKESPEARE, has his back to
text: the stage, his hands over his ears. He is cowering in
text: dread anticipation.
speaker_heading: RALPH AS NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: "What, Juliet!"
text: As SAM is about to enter HENSLOWE'S hand yanks him by the
text: collar, and VIOLA overtakes him and steps on stage. Enter
text: "JULIET." VIOLA is not wearing the been hidden from us by
text: her cloak.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS JULIET
dialog: "How now, who calls?"
speaker_heading: RALPH AS NURSE
dialog: "Your mother."
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS JULIET
dialog: "Madam. I am here, what is your will?
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: There is a collective gasp. Nobody has ever seen a BOY
dialog: PLAYER like this.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.
text: WILL takes his hands from his ears, and turns round in
text: amazement at the sound of VIOLA'S voice.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.
text: WESSEX has just arrived in the auditorium and jumps as if
text: he has been shot. He seems about to intervene, but
text: looking around at the rapt faces he realises he cannot.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.
text: HENSLOWE and BURBAGE look at each other.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: We will all be put in the clink.
speaker_heading: HENSLOWE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: See you in jail.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's
dialog: Law Is death to any he that utters

scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

scene_heading: ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO
speaker_heading: (to ROMEO)
dialog: "I am hurt.
speaker_heading: WILL AS ROMEO
dialog: Courage man. The hurt cannot be much.
scene_heading: ALLEYN A MERCUTIO
dialog: Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find
dialog: me a grave man."
text: A roll of thunder. Over the heads of the audience, far
text: above the thatched roof of the theatre, clouds are
text: gathering in the sky. On stage "MERCUTIO" is in 'ROMEO'S"
dialog: arms, but the tone of the playing is unlike anything we
dialog: have seen before: without bombast, intense and real. And
text: the audience is quiet and attentive.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO (CONT'D)
dialog: "--Why the devil came you between us?
dialog: I was hurt under your arms."
scene_heading: EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.
text: In the semirural view towards the City of London, there
text: can be discerned a gaggle of approaching MEN and three is
text: something orderly about them. As they come closer, we see
text: that they are a company of PIKE MEN, marching toward the
text: theatre, led by the Master of the Revels, TILNEY. Thunder
dialog: rolls.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: Figures are running across the stage, in the panic that
text: follows "TYBALT" death.
speaker_heading: ACTOR AS BENVOLIO
dialog: "Romeo, away, be gone! The citizens
dialog: are up and Tybalt slain. Stand not
dialog: amazed. The prince will doom thee
dialog: death If thou art taken. Hence, be
dialog: gone away!"
speaker_heading: WILL AS ROMEO
dialog: "I am fortune's fool!"
speaker_heading: ACTOR AS BENVOLIO
dialog: "Why dost thou stay!"
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.
text: WILL has just 'killed' "TYBALT." He is still breathless
text: from fighting. he stands face to face with VIOLA.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I am fortune's fool.
text: They stare at each other, transfixed.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You are married?
text: PAUSE. She cannot answer.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: If you be married, my gave is like to
dialog: be my wedding bed. The implication of
text: her silence fills the air. WILL does
dialog: not move.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
dialog: We cannot tell whether this is the play or their life.
dialog: The audience, and the rest of the world, might as well
text: not exist. WILL turn from her and begins to descend from
dialog: the 'balcony.'
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS JULIET
dialog: "Art thou gone so?
text: WILL stops.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS JULIET (CONT'D)
dialog: Love, lord, ay husband, friend, I must
dialog: hear from thee every day in the hour,
dialog: For in a minute there are many days.
dialog: O, by this count I shall be much in
dialog: years Ere I again behold my Romeo"
text: WILL as "ROMEO" seems unable to speak. Then he says:
speaker_heading: WILL AS ROMEO
dialog: "Farewell"
text: All other sounds drain away, and time seems to stop.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS JULIET
dialog: "O think'st thou we shall ever meet
dialog: again? Methinks I see thee, now thou
dialog: art so low, As one dead in the bottom
dialog: of a tomb. Either my eyesight fails,
dialog: or thou lookest pale."
speaker_heading: WILL AS ROMEO
dialog: "Trust me, love, in my eyes so do you.
dialog: Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu.
dialog: Adieu"
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: Now the FRIAR is giving "JULIET' his potion.
speaker_heading: EDWARD AS FRIAR
dialog: "No warmth, no breath shall testify
dialog: thou livest And in this borrow'd
dialog: likeness of shrunk death Thou shall
dialog: continue two and forty hours And then
dialog: awake as from a pleasant sleep"
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: It's FENNYMAN'S moment. The "APOTHECARY" and "ROMEO."
speaker_heading: WILL AS ROMEO
dialog: "Come hither, man. I see that thou art
dialog: poor. Hold, there is forty ducats. Let
dialog: me have A dram of poison--"
scene_heading: FENNYMAN AS APOTHECARY
dialog: "Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's
dialog: law is death to any he that utters
dialog: them!"
text: FENNYMAN has cut in several lines early, but his
dialog: conviction is astonishing.
scene_heading: FENNYMAN AS APOTHECARY
dialog: "My poverty but not my will consents."
speaker_heading: WILL AS ROMEO
dialog: "I pay thy poverty and not thy will."
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. NEAR THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.
text: TILNEY, on the march. His hand grips a copy of the
text: Curtain flyer.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: "JULIET" lies "dead." She lies on top of her tomb, "lying
text: in stage," her best dress, her hair done, her hands in
text: prayer at her breast, her eyes closed. "ROMEO" has found
dialog: her like this.
speaker_heading: WILL AS ROMEO
dialog: "Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your
dialog: last embrace! and lips, Oh you The
text: doors of breath, seal with a righteous
text: kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing
dialog: death! Come, bitter conduct; come,
dialog: unsavory guide! Thou desparate pilot,
text: now at once run on The dashing rocks
dialog: thy seasick weary bark!"
text: As WILL embraces her, VIOLA'S eyes flicker open (shielded
text: by WILL from the audience) and the lovers look at each
text: other for a moment as WILL and VIOLA rather than as
text: "ROMEO" and "JULIET." Their eyes are wet with tears.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: BURBAGE and ROSALINE are watching.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: KEMPE is watching.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: We see that in the audience are several of the WHORES we
text: recognise from the brothel. They are weeping openly.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: WILL is raising the fatal drug in a last toast.
speaker_heading: WILL AS ROMEO
dialog: "Here's to my love (he drinks) O true
dialog: Apothecary."
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.
text: FENNYMAN, moved but proud in the wings.
speaker_heading: FENNYMAN
dialog: (whispers to himself)
dialog: I was good. I was great.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
speaker_heading: WILL AS ROMEO
dialog: "Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss
dialog: I die." (and he dies)
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: The NURSE is weeping too.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: "JULIET" wakes up with a start.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS JULIET
dialog: "Where is my lord?
dialog: I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.
dialog: Where is my Romeo?"
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: (involuntarily)
dialog: Dead!
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS JULIET
dialog: "What here? A cup clos'd in my true
dialog: love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been
dialog: his timeless end."
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
text: "JULIET" takes "ROMEO'S" dagger.
speaker_heading: VIOLA AS JULIET
dialog: "O happy dagger
dialog: This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die."
text: She stabs herself and dies. The "inner curtain" closes
text: over the tomb.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.
text: HIGH ANGLE on audience and stage. "THE PRINCE" played by
text: WABASH is having the last word.
speaker_heading: THE PRINCE
dialog: "For never was a story of more woe
dialog: Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."
text: The end. There is complete silence. The ACTORS are
text: worried. But then the audience goes mad with applause.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE INNER CURTAIN/STAGE. DAY.
text: The inner curtain opens, but WILL and VIOLA, are in a
text: play of their ownembracing and kissing passionately,
text: making their own farewell. HENSLOWE is too stunned and
text: moved to react at first. Then he looks at the audience
text: and the penny drops. It's a hit.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.
text: The audience roars. WILL, VIOLA, and THE COMPANY come
text: forward to meet the applause. TILNEY and his MEN burst
text: in. TILNEY jumps up onto the stage, where the ADMIRAL'S
text: MEN are taking their bows. TILNEY'S "COPS" ring the
text: stage, facing inwards.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: (shouts triumphantly)
dialog: I arrest you in the name of Queen
dialog: Elizabeth!
text: The AUDIENCE goes quiet. BURBAGE jumps out of the
text: audience onto the stage.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: Everybody! The Admiral's Men, The
dialog: Chamberlain's Men and everyone of you
dialog: ne'er-do-wells who stands in contempt
dialog: of the authority invested in me by her
dialog: Majesty.
speaker_heading: BURBAGE
dialog: Contempt? You closed the Rose--I have
dialog: not opened it.
text: TILNEY is at a loss but only for a moment.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: (he points a "j'accuse"
speaker_heading: finger at VIOLA)
dialog: That woman is a woman!
text: The entire audience and the actors, recoil and gasp. The
text: NURSE crosses herself.
speaker_heading: ALLEYN
dialog: What?! A woman?! You mean that goat?!
text: He points at VIOLA, brazening it out without much chance.
speaker_heading: TILNEY
dialog: I'll see you all in the clink! In the
dialog: same of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth
text: And an authoritative voice from the audience interrupts
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Mr. Tilney!
text: It is QUEEN ELIZABETH herself, descending now, her hood
text: and cloak thrown back. She is an awesome sight. A shaft
text: of sunlight hits her.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Have a care with my name, you will
dialog: wear it out.
text: There is a general parting of the waves, soldiers and
text: actors, a general backing off and bowing as QUEEN
text: ELIZABETH takes the limelight.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: The Queen of England does not attend
dialog: exhibitions of public lewdness so
dialog: something is out of joint. Come here,
dialog: Master Kent. Let me look at you.
text: VIOLA comes forward, and is about to curtsey when she
text: catches the QUEEN'S eye, an arresting eye, which arrests
text: the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, the illusion is remarkable and
dialog: your error, Mr. Tilney, easily
dialog: forgiven, but I know something of a
dialog: woman in a man's profession, yes, by
dialog: God, I do know about that. That is
dialog: enough from you, Maser Kent. If only
dialog: Lord Wessex were here.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: He is, Ma'am.
text: The voice belongs to JOHN WEBSTER. He points firmly at a
text: figure in the audience, WESSEX, trying to look
text: inconspicuous.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Your Majesty
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: There was a wager, I rememberas to
dialog: whether a play can show the very truth
dialog: and nature of love. I think you lost
dialog: it today.
dialog: (turning to WEBSTER)
dialog: You are an eager boy. Did you like the
dialog: play?
speaker_heading: WEBSTER
dialog: I liked it when she stabbed herself,
dialog: your Majesty.
text: The QUEEN fixes WILL with a beady eye.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Master Shakespeare. Next time to you
dialog: come to Greenwich, Come as yourself
dialog: and we will speak some more. WILL bows
text: deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The
text: waves part for her.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. MAIN ENTRANCE. DAY.
text: The QUEEN is bowed out through the doors.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.
text: A gaggle of the QUEEN'S favoured courtiers wait by her
text: carriage. WESSEX is hurrying down the exterior staircase
text: as the QUEEN emerges from the theatre. During the
text: following a general egress from the Auditorium is taking
text: place, including some of the actors crowding to see her
text: off. WESSEX bows out of breath.
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Your Majesty!
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so
dialog: soon?
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Indeed I am a bride short. How is this
dialog: to end?
text: VIOLA has come out of the theatre, amongst some of the
text: other players. The QUEEN catches her eye.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: As stories must when love's
dialog: denied--with tears and a journey. Those
dialog: whom God has joined in marriage, not
dialog: even I can put asunder.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (she turns to VIOLA)
dialog: Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost
dialog: his wife in the play- house--go make
dialog: your farewell and send her out. It's
dialog: time to settle accounts.
speaker_heading: (to WESSEX)
dialog: How much was the wager?
speaker_heading: WESSEX
dialog: Fifty shillings.
text: (the QUEEN gives him a look)
dialog: Pounds.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
dialog: Give it to Master Kent. He will see it
text: rightfully home. WESSEX gives his
text: purse to VIOLA.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (to VIOLA)
dialog: And tell Shakespeare something more
text: cheerful next time for Twelfth Night.
text: The QUEEN proceeds towards her carriage. There is an
text: enormous puddle between her and her carriage. The QUEEN
text: hesitates for a fraction and then marches through the
text: puddle as cloaks descend upon it.
speaker_heading: QUEEN (CONT'D)
text: Too late, too late.
text: She splashes her way into her carriage, which departs.
scene_heading: INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (heartbroken, testing her
dialog: name)
dialog: My Lady Wessex?
text: VIOLA nods, heartbroken too. For a long moment they
text: cannot say anything to each other. The she holds up
text: Wessex's purse.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
text: A hired player no longer. Fifty
dialog: pounds, Will, for the poet of true
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I am done with theatre. The playhouse
dialog: is for dreamers. Look where the dream
dialog: has brought us.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: It was we ourselves did that. And for
dialog: my life to come I would not have it
dialog: otherwise.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: If my hurt is to be that you will
dialog: write no more, then I shall be the
dialog: sorrier.
text: WILL looks at her.
speaker_heading: VIOLA (CONT'D)
dialog: The Queen commands a comedy, Will for
text: Twelfth Night.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (harshly)
dialog: A comedy! What will my hero be but the
dialog: saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick
dialog: with love?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: An excellent beginning
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Sold in marriage and half way to
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: (adjusting)
text: At sea, then--a voyage to a new
text: world?she lands upon a vast and empty
text: shore. She is brought to the
dialog: dukeOrsino.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (despite himself)
dialog: Orsinogood name
speaker_heading: VIOLA
text: But fearful of her virtue, she comes
text: to him dressed as a boy
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (Catching it)
dialog: and thus unable to declare her love
text: Pause. They look at each other. Suddenly the conversation
text: seems to be about them.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: But all ends well.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: How does it?
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: I don't know. It's a mystery
text: WILL half smiles. Then he's serious. They look deeply at
text: each otherand rush into each other's arm.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You will never age for me, nor fade,
dialog: nor die.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Nor you for me.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Good bye, my love, a thousand times
dialog: good bye.
speaker_heading: VIOLA
dialog: Write me well.
text: She kisses him with finality. Then turns and runs from
text: him. WILL watches as she goes.
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.
text: A blank page. A hand is writing: TWELFTH NIGHT. We see
text: WILL sitting at his table.
speaker_heading: WILL (VO)
dialog: My story starts at seaa perilous
text: voyage to an unknown landa shipwreck
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.
text: Two figures plunge into the water
speaker_heading: WILL (VO)
text: the wild waters roar and heavethe
text: brave vessel is dashed all to pieces,
dialog: and all the helpless souls within her
dialog: drowned
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.
text: WILL at his table writing
speaker_heading: WILL (VO)
dialog: all save one  a lady
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.
speaker_heading: VIOLA in the water
speaker_heading: WILL (VO)
dialog: whose soul is greater than the ocean
dialog: and her spirit stronger than the sea's
dialog: embrace  not for her watery end, but
text: a new life beginning on a stranger
dialog: shore
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. DAY.
text: VIOLA is walking up a vast and empty beach .
speaker_heading: WILL (VO CONTINUED)
dialog: It will be a love story  for she will
dialog: be my heroine for all time
scene_heading: INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.
text: WILL looks up from the table.
speaker_heading: WILL (VO CONTINUED)
dialog: and her name will be  Viola.
text: He looks down at the paper, and writes: "Viola" Then:
dialog: "What country friends is this?"
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH. DAY.
text: DISSOLVE slowly to VIOLA, walking away up the beach
text: towards her brave new world.
speaker_heading: THE END
