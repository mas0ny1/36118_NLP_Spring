scene_heading: EXT. SOMEWHAT SEEDY TWO-STORY HOTEL IN ATLANTA -- PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: It's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL
text: ATLANTA. The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only
text: source of light as we hear a metallic rattle.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- SECOND FLOOR -- PRE-DAWN
dialog: 
text: We follow the metallic rattle to a door. The rattling stops
text: and we watch the knob slowly turn.
dialog: 
text: Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces "hope."
text: We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the
text: pulling of what looks like a large suitcase.
dialog: 
text: NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling
text: the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage
text: table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and
text: the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior
text: 2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation.
dialog: 
text: She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues
text: digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She
text: opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt
text: foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing.
dialog: 
text: She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She
text: flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks
text: better of it and hangs up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: NICOLE forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988
text: Toyota Tercel and slams it shut.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. 1988 TOYOTA TERCEL -- PARKING LOT -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: We hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on
text: "speaker phone" mode. The phone rests on the passenger seat.
text: We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on
text: the steering wheel. She is exhausted and irritated...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: (as the phone rings)
dialog: Don't pick up...don't pick up...
dialog: don't pick up...
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
text: A MAN answers with music in the background..."Yo.." NICOLE
text: quickly picks up the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's Nic, do you have any? Good
dialog: morning to you too. You're what?
dialog: Well, where are you guys shooting
dialog: today? Where? Text me the
dialog: address. You have some...Okay.
dialog: 
text: She hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview
text: she tries to smile.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: The sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey
text: clouds. We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as
text: a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando. The
text: sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time
text: radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter...
dialog: 
text: An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and
text: gets out of bed. She crosses naked through the room as a
text: cell phone starts ringing.
dialog: 
text: Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and
text: inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo. WHIP wears his
text: 40 some years of life experience like a medal. Smoke hangs
text: in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty
text: carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP
text: snatches up his phone and answers...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: For the love of Christ! Look...just
dialog: hold...HOLD ON.
dialog: 
text: He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a
text: clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the
text: hotel ice bucket.
dialog: 
text: The naked, YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes.
dialog: 
text: We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect
text: crack down the middle. Whip smiles, taking it all in...
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: I've been up since the crack 'a
dialog: dawn. What check? Tuition? How
dialog: much does it cost to go there?
dialog: 
text: The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is
text: puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands.
dialog: 
text: The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second,
text: hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP
text: shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on
text: the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: NO! NO! NO! You decided he needed
dialog: private school...lemme talk to
dialog: Knuckles. He's not? Tell'em the
dialog: phone works both ways. Oh he's my
dialog: son because you need a tuition
dialog: check...that's great Deana. I'm
dialog: glad you tracked me down in Orlando
dialog: at 7 in the fucking morning to
dialog: shake me down for money. Does he
dialog: even like the fucking school? No
dialog: I've never seen it. Yeah I wonder
dialog: why not too. I gotta 9 o'clock
dialog: flight, sit tight 'till I get back
dialog: to Atlanta. How am I a liar?
dialog: What? No, I'll call you.
dialog: 
text: WHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last
text: beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Was that your wife?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: That was my ex-wife. But you
dialog: Trina, you could be my second or
dialog: third wife if you'd just C'mere.
dialog: 
text: The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRINA
dialog: Whip, don't even joke about that.
dialog: Our flight's at 9, let's hit it.
dialog: 
text: TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a
text: white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants. WHIP can't help
text: but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away.
dialog: 
text: ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock
text: anthem...JOE COCKER's "I'm Feeling Alright"
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yeah, I'm feelin' a little light-
dialog: headed. I shoulda ate somethin'.
dialog: 
text: WHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's
text: been cut in half. He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES HOTEL-ORLANDO-HALLWAY-MORNING
dialog: 
text: WHIP wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides
text: confidently down the hallway. JOE COCKER continues to wail,
text: perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that WHIP maintains
text: while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT SOUTHJET TARMAC - AIRPLANE - MORNING RAINING
dialog: 
text: WHIP leans against the landing gear of the JACKSON-RIDGEFIELD
text: 88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of
text: mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the
text: tarmac. WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the
text: mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual
text: walk around. He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the
text: jet way ladder. His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in
text: to a puddle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Son of a bitch!
dialog: 
text: Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the

scene_heading: INT. ORLANDO AIRPORT TERMINAL - JETWAY -- DAY

dialog:

dialog: 
text: There's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose.

speaker_heading: EVANS
dialog: Nothing! No control!

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Goddamn it!!
dialog: 
text: Once again, the plane pitches into a dive. Whip strains to
dialog: hold on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't let go! Can you reach mine?
dialog: 
text: Evans strains to reach Whip's Reversion Pull-Handle -- but

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVANS
dialog: I can't reach it.
dialog: 
text: Evans moves to release his harness, but Whip stops him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: No! Don't! Stay strapped in!
dialog: (calls over his shoulder)
dialog: Margaret! Margaret!
dialog: 
text: Margaret tumbles into the cockpit, catching herself on Whip's
text: chair. She's crying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Oh God, Whip. What's happening?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Get strapped into the jump-seat. I
dialog: need your help.
dialog: 
text: Margaret opens the jump-seat and starts to pull on her
text: harness. Throughout the scene she is struggling with her
dialog: harness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: Margaret, see that red lever on the
dialog: floor next to my chair? The one
dialog: that says, Manual Control?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: On the count of three you pull it
dialog: up, turn it clockwise, then push it
dialog: back down. OK? You ready?
dialog: 
text: With tears streaming down her cheeks, she gives Whip a brave
dialog: nod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: Here we go. One, two...
dialog: 
text: Whip releases back pressure from his yoke, pushing it forward
dialog: -- the plane noses downward 20 degrees!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: ...three!
dialog: 
text: MORE TERRIFIED SHRIEKS come from the back. Margaret quickly
text: disengages then re-engages the large red handle.
dialog: 
text: Whip pulls back on his yoke. The plane pitches up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: Ok. OK. We got something. It's
text: still stiff as hell. Evans, put in
dialog: some power!
dialog: 
text: Evans pushes up the throttles. Whip gingerly applies pressure
text: to his stick. His face fills with worry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know. It feels like the son
dialog: of a bitch wants to nose over.
dialog: 
text: Then suddenly... WHAP! Whip's yoke flies out of his hands and
dialog: SLAMS forward!
dialog: 
text: The plane banks right and drops! Margaret SCREAMS!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: SHIT! POWER BACK!
dialog: (he pulls back the power)
dialog: I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE THIS!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP

speaker_heading: ATC
dialog: Roger, SouthJet 227. Uh...Clayton
dialog: County is 2 miles at your 4
dialog: o'clock.

speaker_heading: WHIP

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ATC
dialog: Copy, SouthJet 227.
dialog: 
text: The plane continues to drop, increasing its nose-down
dialog: attitude and speed.
dialog: 
text: WHIP pushes both of his feet forward, stretching his body to

text: get the plane out of the dive it's in.
dialog: 
text: Evans is starting to lose it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVANS
dialog: Oh Lord, we're descending at 4,700

text: SEE NOTHING BUT HOUSES!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: OK! Here's what we're going to do!
speaker_heading: (TO EVANS)
dialog: When I say, you retract the gear,
text: retract the flaps and trim both

dialog: opposite, so be sure to trim down.
dialog: Margaret...

speaker_heading: EVANS
dialog: Trim down?! What are you gonna do?!
dialog: 
text: Whip takes Margaret's hand and puts it on the throttle
dialog: levers.

speaker_heading: (MARGARET NODS)
dialog: What's your son's name?

speaker_heading: MARGARET

speaker_heading: WHIP

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVANS
speaker_heading: (TERRIFIED)
dialog: WHAT! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ROLL IT?!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Just a little barrel roll. Don't

speaker_heading: EVANS

speaker_heading: WHIP

text: of his hands in wonder.
dialog: 
text: WHIP hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NTSB OFFICER #1
dialog: Captain William Whitaker? Nod if

speaker_heading: (WHIP NODS)
dialog: I'm Craig Matson from the NTSB and

dialog: 
text: WHIP nods as his senses are getting sharper.

speaker_heading: NTSB OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (WHIP NODS)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I'm Doctor Kenan and the good news
dialog: is that you are in good condition.
dialog: You did suffer a concussion which
dialog: is the reason you have a bit of
dialog: blurred vision and a headache. You
dialog: have numerous lacerations around
dialog: your left eye. We're going to leave
dialog: the patch on for a few days as a
dialog: precaution. But it seems your eye
dialog: is OK. MRI's show strained tendons
dialog: in your left knee and ankle but you
dialog: didn't break any bones.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: You have some deep bruising in your
dialog: left thigh and you have a few torn
dialog: ligaments in your left wrist.
dialog: Nothing serious. So as soon as we
dialog: clear you from the concussion, and
dialog: you feel well enough -- you can go
dialog: home. That could be a day, could
dialog: be 3 days. Okay?
dialog: 
text: WHIP quietly nods. The DOCTOR leaves and WHIP begins to
text: study his body. His left leg is wrapped, his left wrist has
dialog: a splint-brace --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NTSB OFFICER #1
dialog: I won't ask too much of you
dialog: tonight, but as I said, the NTSB is
dialog: required to make initial contact.
dialog: How much do you remember about the
dialog: flight?
dialog: 
text: WHIP looks at the NTSB OFFICER and slowly speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I remember everything until the
dialog: crash.
dialog: 
text: WHIP's voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NTSB OFFICER #1
dialog: Okay Mr. Whitaker, that's fine. I
dialog: am required to inform you that this
dialog: incident did result in the loss of
dialog: life.
dialog: (checks an index card)
dialog: The most current information states
dialog: that of the 102 souls on board we
dialog: lost 6. 2 crew members and 4

speaker_heading: WHIP

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: How's Margaret Thomason?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (checks his notes)
text: Broken collar bone, cuts, banged

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm one of a few union reps for the

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's good to see you too, Cowboy.
dialog: You're gonna be okay. We're gonna
dialog: take care of you. That's my job.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: The union will put out a statement
dialog: on your behalf. Condolences to the

speaker_heading: (WHIP NODS)

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yeah, Knuckles.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, how old's he now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Wow, you weren't even married when
dialog: we flew for Delta. We're
dialog: dinosaurs, Whip. Do you want me to
dialog: reach out to Deana and see if she
dialog: and Will want to come? Any family
dialog: you want here, we'll get them here,

dialog: 
text: WHIP thinks about his long since fractured family...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: No, I'll call her.
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Speaking of which, I have your
dialog: phone and some of your personal
text: effects from the plane.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE has a zip-locked bag with his phone, keys, sunglasses
text: and wallet. WHIP looks at them, odd to see them encased in
dialog: plastic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Your clothes are toast. Do you
dialog: need me to get you some stuff?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: No, I'm okay. I'll take care of

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Thanks Charlie, I really...
dialog: (Whip begins to crack)
dialog: It means a lot to me that you came.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay. Get some rest now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Charlie, that plane was fucked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I know. The way you landed that
dialog: plane was nothing short of a
dialog: miracle.
dialog: 
text: WHIP nods trying to pull it together. CHARLIE pats WHIP's
text: shoulder before he leaves. WHIP sits up and pulls his phone
text: from the plastic bag. Dials, waits...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Harling...Harling...yeah, it's
dialog: Whip. I'm in a hospital in South
dialog: Atlanta...what? You know where I
dialog: am? Okay well fuck...yeah, I'm
dialog: okay. What? Well, I'm looking to
dialog: get outta here...hopefully
dialog: tomorrow. Yeah. But, listen, I
dialog: need you to bring me something to
dialog: wear.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: I don't know -- clothes -- and
dialog: smokes, I really need smokes. Tee
dialog: shirt, sweat pants....Harling?
dialog: I'll put you on the visiting list.
dialog: Yeah...and smokes. Just be low
dialog: key, no fucking around, Harling.
dialog: Cigarettes. Okay? I need
dialog: cigarettes. Yeah. Good.
dialog: 
text: WHIP closes his eyes and exhales. He now stares at the foot
text: of the bed for a long, long moment. WHIP squeezes his eyes

dialog: whispering a prayer...

speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL -- ELEVATOR DOORS -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: The Stones "Sympathy for the Devil" kicks up as we wait...
dialog: 
text: The doors split open and HARLING MAYS steps out. HARLING has
text: a pony tail and a goatee and is probably wearing a Tommy
text: Bahama button down shirt.
dialog: 
text: We follow HARLING as he strides down the hall. With ear buds
text: in, HARLING points a Sanyo pistol-shaped cam corder at the
text: ATTENDING NURSE at the nurses' station, recording her...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: I'm on the list baby girl. Check

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: HARLING stands in the doorway looking in. He sees...
dialog: 
text: The MORNING NURSE is helping WHIP to stand. HARLING points

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (O.C.)
dialog: If this is gonna turn into a sponge

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
speaker_heading: SIR-
dialog: 
text: HARLING immediately goes to WHIP and supports him.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: It's okay, Harling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: That's right honey, I'm on the
dialog: list. Harling Mays. Some say they
dialog: Harling knew me.
dialog: 
text: HARLING boxes her out. She steps away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: Honey can you hustle us a couple of
dialog: daiquiris and a cocktail weenie?
dialog: On second thought just bring the
dialog: booze. I brought my own weenie.
dialog: 
text: No reaction as the NURSE collects the trash and towels.
text: HARLING focuses his camcorder on the NURSE and leaves WHIP in
text: an unsteady stance. HARLING films her and comments...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
text: She's offended, and she should be.
dialog: I'm a pig. And I hate me. That's
dialog: what we have in common Nurse
dialog: Ratched...we both hate me.
dialog: 
text: And she's gone. HARLING turns to WHIP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: Whip? What the fuck my man?
dialog: They're sayin', "Sweet Jesus, what
dialog: a fuckin' stud that pilot is."
dialog: You're a hero, no shit. You will
dialog: never pay for another drink in this
dialog: life time. There is crazy news
dialog: people all over, look at this shit--
dialog: 
text: HARLING helps WHIP to the window...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- PARKING LOT -- DAY
dialog: 
text: From WHIP's window we can see a slew of news vans with signal
text: towers as well as reporters milling about -- a small zoo.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
dialog: 
text: HARLING and WHIP stare for a moment at the circus below.
text: WHIP doesn't last long and slowly returns to the bed as
text: HARLING continues to gawk.
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: Classic hero worship, you're a rock
dialog: star man. You gotta see the video
dialog: I've got -- I'm making a doc about
dialog: you, well us, y'know?
dialog: 
text: HARLING pulls an iPad out of his knapsack and flips it open.
text: He lets a collection of videos run...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: This is outside your condo...
dialog: 
text: On HARLING's iPad we see footage of PRESS swarming outside
text: WHIP's condo. We also see the crash scene footage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: Look that's me, and that`s Mark
dialog: Mellon...you know that douchey
dialog: talking haircut from local Atlanta
dialog: channel 3? I said a few words.
dialog: Just straight talk, y'know?
dialog: 
text: WHIP's hands shake as he grabs the bed frame. HARLING takes
text: notice and stashes the iPad...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay Captain Whitaker? Easy...
dialog: 
text: HARLING helps him get settled. We see the beads of sweat on
text: WHIP's lip and forehead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: The meds they're giving me are
dialog: fucking me up -- I'm all shaky and
dialog: dried out. I can't sleep good.
dialog: 
text: HARLING immediately picks up the small paper cup that holds
text: WHIP's pain meds. He fishes out the two pills and stares at
text: them. HARLING shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: Aprazolam? That's generic Xanax and
dialog: this Hydrocodone is generic
dialog: Vicodin. It's shit, prolly
dialog: Canadian.
dialog: 
text: HARLING casually tosses the pills down his gullet and
text: expertly swallows them without water. He grabs WHIP's
text: medical chart and scours it as he prattles on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: We want the premium stuff. Blue
dialog: label...not the fucking well shit.
dialog: Where's the dihydromorphinone?
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: Or just some fucking Palladone
dialog: would suffice. What is this?
dialog: Fucking amateur hour over here?
dialog: Get that goddamned doctor in here.
dialog: You just saved a 100 people from
dialog: death, they should get your fuckin'
dialog: meds right.
dialog: (calls to the door)
dialog: YO! ROOM SERVICE!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Listen Harling, leave it alone.
speaker_heading: (HARLING CHILLS)
dialog: So you got my message and decided
dialog: not to call me back? Did you bring
dialog: me smokes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: I decided to come by instead. And
dialog: yes I got your fucking message and
dialog: yes I brought you smokes.
dialog: 
text: HARLING hands WHIP a pack of smokes from his pocket. He also
text: pulls out a carton of smokes from his backpack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: Here is a fresh carton, enjoy. You
dialog: fucking earned it -- you smoke your
dialog: nuts off, champion. If I were you
dialog: I'd fire up right here in the God
dialog: damn room. Fuck'em, you're
dialog: immortal, you're a fucking God man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Harling...
dialog: 
text: WHIP motions with his hands to "calm down."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: Sorry Whip. It's just...this is
dialog: big time, man. You're a hero in a
dialog: time when we really need heroes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Shut the fuck up, Harling...Six
dialog: people died.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: 96 people lived! When are you
dialog: gonna take yes for an answer? Pick
dialog: up the phone, man. Fuck.
dialog: 
text: HARLING pulls something from his vest pocket and puts it in
text: WHIP'S hand. WHIP looks at it and back at HARLING.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: Here's a pint of Smirnoff and a few
dialog: Red Bulls. You know what I'm
dialog: sayin'? I know my customer.
dialog: 
text: HARLING continues to pull items from the bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Harling, take the vodka with you.
dialog: 
text: HARLING freezes his frenzied energy with this odd command.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: What?! Take the vodka? Dude, are
dialog: you insane? I'm gonna just tuck it
dialog: in the bottom of your-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Take the fucking vodka!
dialog: 
text: HARLING hears him this time and raises his hand and nods,
text: putting the VODKA back in his own duffel. HARLING tosses a
text: tee shirt, sweat pants and flip-flops on the bed, then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: Okay man. Check it out.
dialog: 
text: HARLING holds up a silk Japanese Happi Coat, with elaborate
text: stitching depicting colorful birds flying around Mt. Fuji.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Look, I'm tired man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: I'm out. You rest up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: You gotta come and get me,
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: 
text: WHIP pulls his keys from the bag that CHARLIE gave him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: Here are my keys. Go to the condo
dialog: and bring me some nice clothes I
dialog: can wear, my phone charger and grab
dialog: the veal outta my fridge. It's
dialog: marked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: The veal?
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yeah, the veal that's in my
dialog: freezer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: Done and done. What time you need
dialog: me here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Tomorrow. I'll call you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: Send the mayday and you're outta
dialog: here in 7 minutes.
speaker_heading: (A SMILE)
dialog: I got you a few stroke mags too.
dialog: I've been in hospitals. I know
dialog: what you need. JUGS, HOT MILFS in
dialog: heat. ASSMASTERS. You should just
dialog: stroke it all day. You're a hero --
dialog: know what I'm saying? If I was in
dialog: here I'd be jerkin' it all day
dialog: long. See, there's a smile.
dialog: 
text: HARLING puts his hand on WHIP's forehead in an attempt to
text: reassure him. A quiet moment before HARLING slips out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- 11 PM -- SAME EVENING
dialog: 
text: WHIP wakes up in a cold sweat. He is breathing heavy as he
text: scans the room. LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window.
text: Thunder RUMBLES.
dialog: 
text: WHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine
text: gum has been chewed through. WHIP uses his hands to get to
text: the edge of the bed. He roots through the duffle bag that
text: HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter
text: still in its package.
dialog: 
text: Determined to smoke, WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been
text: placed next to his bed. Leaning against the wheelchair is a
dialog: medical cane.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL -- QUIET HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Wearing his Happi Coat (or robe), WHIP limps in to the empty
text: hallway with the use of his cane. He checks the quiet
text: corridor as he begins his quest...
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL -- FIRE DOOR -- 11:38 PM
dialog: 
text: The door swings open, and no one appears to be on the other
text: side. Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to
text: slip through. A hand grabs the door and holds it. WHIP
text: walks into the sanctity of the stairwell.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: We find the owner of the helping hand was NICOLE who returns
text: to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she
text: demurely smokes a cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: WHIP leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a
text: pack of smokes from his pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't think anyone would have
dialog: the same devious thought about
text: using the fire stairs to have a
dialog: smoke...
dialog: 
text: NICOLE smiles and looks down, awkward around men when she is
text: not loaded. She drops her cigarette which we see was barely
text: smoked as she maneuvers to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't go. I'll be quiet.
dialog: 
text: He offers her a cigarette, she takes it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: We don't have to talk. Be nice to
dialog: just smoke with someone.
dialog: 
text: And they do. They sit in silence as the stairwell fills up
text: with smoke. After a long beat...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Were you on the plane?
dialog: 
text: WHIP studies her, she's beautiful in an exhausted way...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yeah, I was. Were you?
dialog: 
text: Nicole shakes her head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Where were you sitting?
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
text: Up near the front.
dialog: 
text: Again it falls silent as we let them smoke and think in the
text: sanctity of the fire stairs.
dialog: 
text: A VOICE breaks their silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Tobacco's but an Indian weed,
text: Grows green in the morn, cut down
dialog: at eve; It shows our decay, We are
dialog: but clay;...I love the smell of
text: Nicotina in the morning. Smells
dialog: like...victory.
dialog: 
text: We hear a metallic rattle and WHIP and NICOLE look to the
dialog: stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't flee dear comrades! Really,
dialog: wait for me, please.
dialog: 
text: A GAUNT YOUNG MAN makes his way to their landing. He is
text: dressed in a hospital gown and carrying an I.V. pole on which

text: completely left him. His skin is gray. Eyes hollowed from
dialog: his battle with cancer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAUNT YOUNG MAN
dialog: Can I bum a smoke?
dialog: 
text: WHIP offers him a cigarette. He takes it and fires it up

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yeah, I'm lucky. Goin' home
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAUNT YOUNG MAN
dialog: Home. Home for me is the basement,

speaker_heading: GAUNT YOUNG MAN
dialog: No. I'm dying here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: What kind of cancer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAUNT YOUNG MAN
dialog: Fibro-mixzoid sarcoma, soft tissue
dialog: sarcoma. Very rare, God chose me.

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: God chose you? You believe in God?

speaker_heading: GAUNT YOUNG MAN

dialog: 
text: The GOD topic has silenced the stairwell...

speaker_heading: GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: As soon as you realize that the

dialog: God...you will live a much better
dialog: life. You spend your life
dialog: believing that you have all the
dialog: control over what happens.
dialog: Bullshit. The plane you're flying
dialog: goes down? Out of your control.
dialog: God gives you cancer. I have no
dialog: control over that. Did God give me
dialog: cancer? You bet your ass God gave
dialog: me cancer. You think if I begged
dialog: for cancer God would have given it
dialog: to me?
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: No...because I assure you I have

dialog: and guess what? I have no control
dialog: over that.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I get another smoke? What's
dialog: wrong with you honey? You're
dialog: beautiful, do you know that? Do I
dialog: scare you? People either have to
dialog: pretend they don't see me or
dialog: they're drawn to me. It's funny
dialog: because people see me as being
dialog: close to the other side -- they
dialog: feel like I have power or wisdom.
dialog: They think I have the answers. Who
dialog: knows? Maybe I do. Death gives
dialog: you perspective. I lived my life
text: so indecisive, in a haze. But now
dialog: that I'm dying everything is so

speaker_heading: GAUNT YOUNG MAN

speaker_heading: GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Here's a pack.

speaker_heading: GAUNT YOUNG MAN

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: But why'd that guy ask you if you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I dunno. I flat-lined twice in the

dialog: needles tend to die. Especially
dialog: women for some reason.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Is that right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I have a pamphlet to prove it. A

dialog: 
text: The Stones, "Gimme Shelter" starts to play...
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. HARLING'S CADDY -- DAY

speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM - DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: CELL PHONE
dialog: You have 127 messages.
speaker_heading: (A BEEP)

dialog: 
text: WHIP again deletes the message and decides to just shut the

dialog: 
text: WHIP holds it up, opens it and pours a few out in his hand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog:

dialog: the toilet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: WHIP goes to the collection of liquor bottles next to the
text: sink that act as a makeshift bar. He picks up a bottle of
text: vodka. He unscrews the cap and sniffs the contents. He
text: slowly tips the bottle and pours it into the sink.
dialog: 
text: Whip opens the refrigerator and removes an assortment of

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: A cigarette dangles from WHIP's mouth as he ferrets around

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- LATER
dialog:

dialog: 
text: He pours the vodka in the sink and tosses the bottle into the

dialog: 
text: Through the kitchen window, Whip sees the farm's old

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- DAY
dialog: 
text: WHIP slides open the heavy barn doors to reveal -- A VINTAGE

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- AIRPLANE -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Whip walks past the plane and starts to examine the large,

dialog: 
text: A CROP DUSTER acts as the background for a picture with a 15

text: A series of pictures feature the PLANE in flight and SHOTS
text: TAKEN FROM THE PLANE, aerials of the farm, etc.
dialog: 
text: WHIP holds the framed shot of he and his dad as he walks back
text: to the plane, resting his arm on the wing.
dialog: 
text: WHIP pulls himself from the wall of photos and stares at his
dialog: stuff. We recognize what must be the stuff he took from his
text: house after his divorce. We see bikes, weights and fishing
dialog: gear.
dialog: 
text: Whip rummages through a box of things packed from his home
dialog: office. Trophies, sports memorabilia, citations -- A PHOTO OF
text: HE AND HIS WIFE from happier times. THEIR WEDDING PHOTO.
dialog: 
text: Now Whip comes upon A FRAMED BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO of he and
text: Charlie in their younger, Navy days -- wearing flight suits
text: and standing on a carrier flight deck in front of an F-14
text: Tomcat. Big smiles, full of hotshot pilot swagger.
dialog: 
text: WHIP puts the photo back and spots his golf bag. He roots
text: out a pint of cheap vodka from the inner pocket.
dialog: 
text: Next he finds a fifth of bourbon in his bicycle saddle bag.
dialog:

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: God landed the plane?

dialog: wanted him at the crash site. So..
dialog: 
text: WHIP is quiet, anxious to hear the purpose of the meeting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Whip, as you know, when a plane
text: crashes, the NTSB sends a "go team"
text: to the crash site immediately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: They find the flight data
dialog: recorders?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes they found them, perfectly

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Great. That solves everything.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
text: The plane fell apart at 30 thousand
dialog: feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The airline will try to prove
dialog: equipment failure. Which would
dialog: make the manufacturer responsible.
dialog: The manufacturer of the plane will
dialog: try to prove poor maintenance of
text: the equipment by the airline.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Or pilot error.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I had to fly that plane inverted,
dialog: that means upside down, Hugh. Do
dialog: you get the picture? 100
text: passengers hanging upside down, 500
dialog: feet off the ground. Do you have
dialog: any idea what that sounds like?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: I do. I heard the black box last

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Are you a pilot?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH LANG
dialog: No I'm not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Then you don't know what the fuck
dialog: you're talking about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hugh's on our team and it's the
text: NTSB's ball game. They run the
dialog: investigation and they will
dialog: ultimately rule on the cause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: They interview the entire flight

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: When did they do that?

speaker_heading: HUGH
text: In the hospital. It's the first

dialog: -- one of the most lenient drunk
dialog: driving countries in the world --

dialog: 
text: They all digest the information as the WAITRESS delivers the
text: cinnamon rolls. She leaves. It's still quiet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: What does that mean? I had a beer
dialog: the night before I flew. And
dialog: what...That made the tail of the
dialog: plane explode?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Separate issues Whip-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I need a lawyer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hugh is your lawyer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I need a bigger lawyer. A lawyer
dialog: who understands that I flew a
dialog: broken plane and without me at that
dialog: stick there'd be 102 funerals, not
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: We're talking about prison not
dialog: funerals. Somebody has-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: To write checks, well it's not me I
dialog: promise you that. And as long as
dialog: they're writing checks, write me
dialog: one because someone put me in a

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: EASY WHIP-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: This tox report states that you
dialog: were drunk and high on cocaine,
dialog: felonies punishable by 24 years in
dialog: jail. And if your intoxication is
dialog: proven to have caused the death of
dialog: the 4 passengers you'll get 4

dialog: be life in prison.

dialog: 
dialog: Can I now do my job on your behalf
dialog: and kill this tox report?
dialog: 
text: WHIP is listening. CHARLIE tries to reign it in.

dialog: Don't worry Whip, you're gonna walk
dialog: away the hero you deserve to be.

text: We turned like a corkscrew and all
dialog: I could think was, "this is really
dialog: happening, I'm going to die" and
dialog: then all of a sudden the plane was
text: upside down but steady and the
dialog: pilot must have known how to fly it
text: that way. He flipped it back over

speaker_heading: NEIGHBOR
dialog: I thought it was thunder at first.
text: But it shook the ground hard.
dialog: Thunder don't do like that. I ran
dialog: outside and I could hear people

dialog: dogs and headed down there. Then I
text: saw the plane crumpled on the

scene_heading: CRASH SITE REPORTER #3

scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- DAY

speaker_heading: WHIP

scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SITE -- OBSERVATION SCAFFOLDING -- DAY
dialog: 
text: WHIP joins HUGH on a rectangular platform on top of a two-

speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: You can see the initial impact

dialog: at impact, I think everyone would
dialog: have walked off that plane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
text: The left wing partially pulled away-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: It snapped but stayed connected to
text: the airframe. So it whipped back
text: towards the plane, hit the fuselage
dialog: in front of the tail. If you were
text: sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on
dialog: the left side, it was like being
text: hit by a train.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I drank a lot the night before that
dialog: flight. I drank that morning too
dialog: and I used coke to straighten up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH

speaker_heading: HUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen clearly. There was a

speaker_heading: LEN CALDWELL
dialog: There were 6 fatalities on the
speaker_heading: PLANE-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH LANG
dialog: The 2 crew members don't get

dialog: That's a workman's comp claim, part

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. CARR
dialog: You're the lawyer for the pilots'
dialog: union?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEN CALDWELL
dialog: No, this is Hugh Lang, the attorney
dialog: we brought in to handle the
dialog: criminal side of Captain Whitaker's
dialog: situation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. CARR
dialog: Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's
dialog: situation? NTSB is up my ass with

dialog: booze and coke? This guy's a real
dialog: peach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: I'm gonna kill the toxicology
dialog: report.
dialog: (feels eyes of disbelief)
dialog: It was done incompetently. The
dialog: last time the toxicology equipment
dialog: they used was calibrated was in
dialog: June of 2009, which is 18 months
dialog: past code. Their log that should
dialog: clearly state who labeled the blood
dialog: vials and when, is very incomplete.
dialog: And they aren't sure who stored
dialog: them. They used a preservative in
dialog: the vials that has in some cases
dialog: caused blood to ferment and
text: register higher in an alcohol test.
dialog: That's what I've done so far. I
dialog: can handle this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. CARR
dialog: I like this guy Lenny. He makes me

dialog: and fly a jet.

scene_heading: CARR'S BUSINESS GUY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEN CALDWELL
dialog: Speaking for the pilots' union? We

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. CARR

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH LANG

speaker_heading: MR. CARR
dialog: He's going to jail. He belongs in

speaker_heading: HUGH LANG
dialog: You're wrong, Mr. Carr.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARR'S ATTORNEY
dialog: Last time I checked, 6 counts of

speaker_heading: MR. CARR
dialog: They tell me you're some kind of

dialog: Get up! What? You can't get up?!
dialog: (Whip is laughing...)
text: C'mon, Knuckles Whitaker drags
text: himself up and goes long...go.
dialog: 
text: We watch an 8 year-old WILL WHITAKER run long as the ball
text: flies to him. He catches it and on-screen WHIP hollers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Touchdown Whitaker! Atta boy!
dialog: C'mon back. What? Come back and
dialog: do it again. Tired? Junior, you
dialog: don't know tired. I'm not going
dialog: out. You go out. Keep running.
dialog: 
text: We pull away from the screen to find WHIP who sits on the
text: couch. A large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many
text: dead beers and an ashtray that overflows.
dialog: 
text: WHIP moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a
text: cigarette from the pack and light it. He freezes at one
text: point and places his hands straight out in front of himself,
text: a strange, involuntary, drunken reset. His stare is a 1000
text: miles offshore; he is anywhere but on this planet. Oblivion.
dialog: 
text: The light from the HEADLIGHTS of a car in the driveway wash

speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Hey. Sorry I'm a little late, but
dialog: we went for coffee after the
dialog: meeting...
dialog: (Whip doesn't look)
dialog: Whip?
dialog: 
text: NICOLE goes close to see WHIP look at her with a non-focused
text: stare. She sees the table and reads the situation.
dialog: 
text: NICOLE watches as WHIP stands up. In his oblivion he tries
dialog: to focus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Don't, don't, don't! I'll get him.
dialog: Knuckles, junior. See him. Yeah.
dialog: I'm not calling again. Fuck him.
dialog: He didn't call. Not back. Not
text: calling back.
dialog: 
text: NICOLE backs away as she watches the blacked-out ballet play
text: itself out in slow, tragic fashion. WHIP motions to his lips
text: as if he is smoking. He freezes and then steps forward and
text: trips in to the coffee table. Whip falls to the ground.
dialog: 
text: NICOLE checks WHIP's face to see his eyes partially opened
text: but passed out. NICOLE goes to the bedroom and returns with
text: a blanket that she covers WHIP with. She also places a
text: pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to
text: the side so he doesn't choke.
dialog: 
text: NICOLE looks around the room. She begins to collect the
text: bottles and straighten up.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BEDROOM -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON WHIP's FACE as he struggles with a thick hangover.
text: He rubs his face and smacks his lips, he's dry as a bone.
text: WHIP shakes his head as he tries to focus his look through
text: the bedroom window. He looks out to see NICOLE sitting on a
text: chair enjoying the landscape. WHIP rubs his head before
text: walking to the kitchen.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- PORCH -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: NICOLE sits with her camera staring at a candle on the table

dialog: 
text: WHIP enters carrying the large plastic bottle of water from
dialog: the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Morning.
dialog: 
text: WHIP coughs and rubs his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Are you okay? You were in bad
dialog: shape when I got home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Tired. Guess I drank a bit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: A bit?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: You wanna count the fuckin' beers?
text: They're still in the garbage.
dialog: Vodka too, is that okay with you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: It's more than okay, Whip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
text: It's quiet as they let the awkward exchange pass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I've been watching the sky change

dialog: (holds up the camera)
dialog: Perfect light, I went out and took
dialog: some great shots.
dialog: 
text: WHIP reaches for the camera. She hands it to him.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Lemme see that camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: My mom got it for me. Towards the
dialog: end, when she knew she wasn't gonna
dialog: recover. She maxed out her credit
dialog: card to buy me that camera and a
dialog: lighting kit.
dialog: 
text: NICOLE takes a moment to tamp down some emotions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's just so beautiful here. Did
dialog: you grow up here?
dialog: 
text: WHIP still holds the camera as he sits down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: It was my grandfather's farm, my
dialog: dad grew up here. He was a pilot
dialog: in World War II, flew with the
dialog: 332nd. See the landing strip out
dialog: there? He built that. He ran a
dialog: crop duster outta here until the
dialog: EPA put an end to that.
dialog: (she nods, listening)
dialog: He traded the crop duster for a
dialog: used Cessna. He flew that damn
text: thing all over. It's still in the
dialog: barn. I was gonna sell this place
dialog: after my dad died. Then I got
dialog: divorced...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: And your mom?

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Dead...she's dead. Your dad still

speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I'm pretty sure my father lives in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: You got no relationship with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: He drank. It was my mom that

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE (CONT'D)
dialog: She held it together for so long, I
text: couldn't tell how sick she was.
dialog: Even through chemo she looked
dialog: beautiful.
dialog: 
text: NICOLE leans over and blows out the candle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE (CONT'D)
dialog: They gave her very heavy meds for
dialog: pain. Dilauded, morphine,
dialog: oxycontin. I started taking them
dialog: with her. We would get all
dialog: medicated and sit in our back yard
dialog: and talk and talk and watch the sun
dialog: go down. We'd be so stoned that we
dialog: couldn't get up to go inside when
dialog: it got dark.
dialog: (laughs, fights the pain)
dialog: I know it sounds crazy to get
dialog: hooked on dope with your mom, but
dialog: she was dying and we spent her last
dialog: seven months together like
dialog: teenagers, trading stories about
dialog: boys and whatever. She loved me.
dialog:

dialog: like a nice restaurant Whip, which
dialog: one was it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP

speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: It's a lie. Whip, it's a lie.
dialog: Trina told me you two hadn't been
dialog: to sleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: My lack of sleep made the plane
dialog: fall apart, huh Margaret? I'm just
dialog: trying to get it straight. You
dialog: think that another pilot would have
dialog: been able to land that plane and
dialog: save more lives?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARGARET
dialog: I didn't say that Whip. I can't

speaker_heading: EVANS (CONT'D)

dialog: one judge --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKI EVANS
dialog: Praise Jesus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVANS

dialog: 
text: WHIP stares into EVANS' eyes and sees a believer's
text: conviction. EVANS reaches out his hand to WHIP.
dialog: 
text: WHIP slowly moves out of his chair and kneels at the side of
text: EVANS' bed. WHIP takes EVANS' hand and bows his head as he
text: reaches for VICKI's at the same time. It's quiet before...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVANS (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus our Lord and savior we thank
dialog: you for blessing Captain Whitaker
dialog: with courage and wisdom. For
text: guiding his hand on that fateful
dialog: morning. In his divine light we

dialog: 105.

dialog: 
text: WHIP emerges from the cockpit. He's still in his suit but
text: with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up. He's energized

dialog: 
text: NICOLE notes the cloud of smoke hanging in the air and the

speaker_heading: NICOLE

speaker_heading: WHIP

speaker_heading: NICOLE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: Do you? You choose it? I don't
dialog: see a lot of choice goin' on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I choose to drink! And I blame it

scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: NICOLE
dialog: I'd love for you to get help, Whip.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I'll be sober. I won't force you
dialog: to stay. I promise if you don't

dialog: You can leave.
dialog: 
text: This is the most sincere plea she's ever heard.

speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: It's so beautiful there. We'll

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: NICOLE is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table. Past
text: NICOLE we can see WHIP lying in bed.
dialog: 
text: She has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at
text: her feet. She finishes a handwritten note and places it
text: down. NICOLE picks up the note and begins to reread it.
dialog: 110.
dialog: 
text: She hears a car in the driveway -- she picks up her stuff and
text: takes one last look at the sleeping WHIP. She leaves,
dialog: careful not to make a sound.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- FRONT DOOR -- EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: NICOLE quietly exits the house, carrying a crate of her
text: stuff. She has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as
text: she makes her way to SHEILA's car that we see parked at the
text: top of the driveway, far from the house.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER RANCH -- BEDROOM -- LATER SAME DAY
dialog: 
text: WHIP stirs, wakes up and looks around. WHIP walks around
text: looking for NICOLE. He finds the note and reads it. The
text: reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the
text: window and stares out at the barn.
dialog: 
text: WHIP returns his look inside the house and he sees the big
text: book of AA on the table near where the letter was left. WHIP
text: picks it up and throws it across the room. He then grabs the
text: back of a chair and tosses it against the wall.
dialog: 
text: After wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer
text: bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall.
text: The bottle explodes and WHIP stops as he realizes he came
text: within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his
dialog: son.
dialog: 
text: We hear the antiquated ring of the OLD HOUSE PHONE. WHIP
text: relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him.
dialog: 
text: Whip is now drawing heavy breaths as the ringing phone is
text: answered by the old machine...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP'S FATHER'S VOICE
dialog: You've reached the Whitaker Crop
dialog: Dusting Company, flying lessons and

text: The beep concludes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (speaking to voice mail)
dialog: Hey Whip, if you're there
dialog: pickup...I got some good news...
dialog: 
text: WHIP snatches the phone of the hook.

scene_heading: EXT. NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY
dialog: 
text: WHIP sits in his car. Rain pounds the windshield as we watch
text: him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange juice.
text: WHIP gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink.
dialog: 
text: WHIP takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and
text: stowing it in the glove box. WHIP gets out and we watch him
text: walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar. A SECURITY
text: GUARD meets him and takes him inside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY
dialog: 
text: WHIP is now alone in the huge, brightly lit hangar. He sees
dialog: the plane.
dialog: 
text: The JR-88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as
text: possible. Like the skeleton of a T-Rex in a museum. The
text: sight is awesome, breathtaking. WHIP walks closer to the
text: twisted wreck and stops. WHIP is overwhelmed by the sight
text: and as he is about to leave...
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE steps out of the passenger door and calls down to
speaker_heading: WHIP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Here's our guy. C'mon.
dialog: 
text: WHIP walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the
text: plane where the door used to be. CHARLIE stands at the top
text: of the ramp. Suddenly HUGH steps out of the plane...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Captain Whitaker, we've won.
dialog: 
text: WHIP doesn't move as HUGH starts down the ramp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: This is what we call in my
dialog: profession a "walk over."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: They've scheduled the hearing. It's
dialog: in 10 days.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE and HUGH reach the bottom of the ramp.
dialog: 112.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: But these hearings can be tough.
dialog: You just need to stay sharp and on
dialog: course and answer the questions
dialog: correctly. It's no longer a
dialog: question of your condition but the
dialog: condition of the plane.
dialog: 
text: This picks directly at the scab of WHIP's guilt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: I've had an "Act of God"
dialog: successfully added to the list of
dialog: probable causes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Look, it's simple. I flew a broken
dialog: plane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You got it. That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: And what about my toxicology
dialog: report?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: (trying to stay calm)
dialog: I killed it. They have no physical
dialog: proof that you were intoxicated on
dialog: that plane. And no eye witness
dialog: claims. But there's a problem.
dialog: 
text: This stops WHIP cold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Because of the turbulence at the
dialog: beginning of the flight and then
dialog: the crash, there was never any
dialog: drink service on the flight. But,
dialog: they found two little vodka bottles
text: in the galley trash bin. There was
dialog: no physical evidence found on the
dialog: bottles, no DNA, no finger prints.
text: But both the bottles were uncapped
dialog: and empty. The only people who had
dialog: access to those bottles and could
dialog: have drank them were the flight
text: crew. Margaret, Evans and Camelia
dialog: Satou all had clean tox reports.
dialog: That leaves you and Trina Marquez.
dialog: 
text: They let that land. WHIP nods.
dialog: 113.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Okay. I see...where this is going.
dialog: That's funny that they found two
dialog: bottles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Because I drank three. One's
dialog: missing.
dialog: 
text: HUGH explodes in frustration.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH LANG
dialog: When I met you I couldn't believe
dialog: what a flip, drunk, arrogant
dialog: scumbag you were.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Fuck you too, Hugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH LANG
dialog: But I did the research and heard
dialog: the analysis from the experts. I'm
dialog: in awe of what you did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP

dialog: safely land these broken planes?
dialog:

speaker_heading: HUGH LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Not one. Every pilot crashed and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yeah. So?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: You have no capacity to accept the
dialog: responsibility for the miracle you
dialog: performed and the lives you saved.

speaker_heading: WHIP

speaker_heading: WHIP

speaker_heading: HUGH

dialog: This NTSB hearing is a Federal
dialog: Agency Hearing. Do you understand

speaker_heading: HUGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything we've done? Everything

dialog: That's not on me. I did my job.

dialog: straight and get him to the church
dialog: on time.
dialog: 115.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yeah Charlie just get him home.
dialog: Sober him up long enough to save
dialog: the union's contract and that fat
dialog: fuck's airline. Fuck you. I

text: shiny floor of the hangar and into the growing rain storm.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE THE WHITAKER FARM -- DAY
dialog: 
text: The rain has subsided as WHIP pulls up to his driveway.
dialog: 
text: Whip turns into the driveway and spots a NEWS VAN in front of

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NICE MODEST SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY

text: the street gets out of his car, talking on a cell phone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DOOR -- NICE SUBURBAN HOME -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: WHIP walks up the steps and knocks on the door. He waits a

dialog: staring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEANA

dialog: 
text: A GROWING GALLERY OF NEWS RATS START JOSTLING FOR PICS
dialog:

speaker_heading: WHIP.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #1

dialog: 
scene_heading: DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #2

dialog: 
scene_heading: DEANA'S PORCH REPORTER #1
dialog: How well did you know Katerina

text: relaxed smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Folks, please give us some room.
dialog: (gets down the stairs)
dialog: At the appropriate time I will tell
dialog: my story. Now is a time for

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I'm Captain Whitaker, I was-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: Yes sir, I know who you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Can you get me to my car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
speaker_heading: (STUDIES HIM)
dialog: Anything you need, sir.
dialog: 
text: WHIP walks with the YOUNG COP who shields him from the fray.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WHIP'S BUICK -- DEANA'S STREET -- MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: We can see the YOUNG COP standing in front of the driver side
text: door, shielding WHIP from the press who stay away.
dialog: 
text: 116 WHIP exhales, trying to slow his racing heart and head. He's
dialog: 116
text: drunk but controlled. He looks at his hands. They are
dialog: shaking.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -- OFFICE - CLOSE ON TELEVISION - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: We see WHIP on the TV repeating the speech he gave reporters
text: on DEANA's front lawn...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Now is a time for grieving and
dialog: taking care of those injured.
dialog: Thank you. I appreciate your
dialog: interest in me but I ask that you
dialog: leave my family in peace.
dialog: 
text: A REPORTER now wraps up the piece...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TELEVISION
dialog: A reasonable request from a quiet,
dialog: heroic man who's been through so
dialog: much. This is Tilda Banden
text: reporting from Devonwood.
dialog: 
text: Now a DESK ANCHOR changes stories...
dialog: 120.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DESK ANCHOR
dialog: In a related story, tonight at 10
dialog: Cale Rawson talks with aviation
dialog: experts to see if the tragedy of
dialog: flight 227 could have been avoided.
dialog: 
text: We boom down to find WHIP who looks drained as he sits on
text: CHARLIE's couch in the fastidiously neat office. WHIP holds
text: an unlit smoke.
dialog: 
text: The WOODEN POCKET DOORS SLIDE OPEN and CHARLIE's WIFE
text: gestures towards WHIP. WHIP stands as CHARLIE enters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Hey, Charlie. Thank you. Amanda
dialog: was so nice to let me in. It's
dialog: just...I couldn't find a safe
dialog: place.
dialog: 
text: AMANDA slides the door shut as CHARLIE throws his bag and his
text: coat down with gusto. He reaches up and pushes a button on
text: the TV and it goes off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What the hell is wrong with you? I
dialog: spoke to Hugh, he told me that you
dialog: went to your ex-wife's house?
text: Drunk as a skunk and the news crews
dialog: showed up?
dialog: (Whip just stares)
dialog: And the police escorted you out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I think it's okay. I've been
dialog: watching and I think it's okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hugh checked every media outlet
dialog: that covered it and it looks like
dialog: we're good. You come off fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Okay. Good then. Listen Charlie,
dialog: here's the deal-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No Whip. No deals. Look at you.
dialog: I have no idea what you're gonna do
dialog: or say, ever. You're all over the
dialog: place. I was the one guy in your
dialog: court. I was your apologist, your
dialog: defender. But not anymore.
dialog: 121.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: No. I can do this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're about to be questioned by a
dialog: Federal Agency about piloting an
text: airliner drunk...an airliner that
dialog: crashed. And you continue to drink
dialog: and stumble around. What kind of
dialog: crazy do you have to be to do that?
dialog: I'm scared of you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Let's just stick to the plan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You can't stick to anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: This whole thing has just been so
dialog: heavy, it's killing me. Tell Hugh,
dialog: I can do it. Look, I really wanna
dialog: fly again, get back to my life and
dialog: be done with all this shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This hearing is 10 days away. Hugh
dialog: busted his ass to try to get you
dialog: excused, but there's no way. You
dialog: have to appear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Let me stay here. They have my
dialog: houses all staked out now. Let me
dialog: stay here until the hearing,
dialog: Charlie. I won't leave the house.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE takes a long look at his old, troubled friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You can't drink here, Whip. You
dialog: can't drink in my house. Can you
dialog: do that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I won't drink.
dialog: 
text: 118 CHARLIE nods, hoping that WHIP can deliver on that promise 118
dialog: 122.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ST. JEROME HOTEL -- GUEST HALLWAY -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: We watch a can of Coca Cola swing in WHIP's hand. We pull
text: out to find WHIP walking with CHARLIE down a hallway of THE
text: ST. JEROME HOTEL. Time has passed as WHIP looks the best
text: we've ever seen him look. He is well rested, well dressed
text: and carrying a suit in a wardrobe bag.
dialog: 
text: As we approach the open door to a guest room, HUGH pops out.
text: A plain clothes SECURITY GUARD follows HUGH out of the room
text: and stands behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: You look great, Whip. I mean that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Thank you. I feel really good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: I heard you haven't had a drink in
dialog: 8 days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: 9 days...
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: Two hours and 26 minutes...but
dialog: who's counting?
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE addresses the SECURITY GUARD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Officer Edmonds?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER EDMONDS
dialog: Yes sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Whip, Officer Edmonds will be
dialog: staying here tonight. Any problems
dialog: he'll handle it.
dialog: 
text: HUGH stands by the open door and gestures CHARLIE and WHIP
dialog: inside...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: HUGH walks in to the center of the room and turns to WHIP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Well, Whip we just wanted to make
dialog: this as easy for you as possible.
dialog: 
text: WHIP puts his wardrobe bag down on the bed.
dialog: 123.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Just get a good night's rest.
dialog: Relax, order up a steak, get a
dialog: movie.
dialog: 
text: WHIP is checking his phone. HUGH gestures to CHARLIE for him
dialog: to leave so they can be alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, cowboy, I'm out. The hearing
dialog: starts at 10, so we should plan on
dialog: 9 for breakfast here in the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Wait, Charlie, thanks for letting
dialog: me stay with you. I needed it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You did great cowboy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: You've got a beautiful family.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm very blessed.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE leaves and HUGH joins WHIP at the window. HUGH hands
text: WHIP a thick folder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH LANG
dialog: I made you a copy of my entire file
dialog: on you and the investigation. I
dialog: also tried to anticipate what you
dialog: might be asked under oath and I
dialog: wrote out some non-damaging
dialog: responses. It's all in there;
dialog: photos, testimony, interviews...I
dialog: called Ellen Block let her know
dialog: that you're here and all tucked in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: So does she have the knife out for
dialog: me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH LANG
dialog: Remember she's limited in what she
dialog: can ask you. You're not on trial
dialog: but you are under oath. She's
dialog: probably not happy that I killed
dialog: the tox report, but you'll be fine.
dialog: 
text: WHIP laughs a little.
dialog: 124.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll see you in the morning.
dialog: 
text: The two respectfully nod. HUGH leaves and the door shuts
text: behind him. WHIP puts the folder on the table and steps to
text: the mini-bar. He bends down and opens the fridge...
dialog: 
text: WHIP sees the fridge is overly stocked with soda and juices.
dialog: Every soft drink you can imagine. No booze, anywhere. WHIP
text: chuckles about the alcohol removal as he grabs a coke.
dialog: 
text: WHIP unbuttons his shirt and pulls it out of his waist line.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Whip sits on the edge of the bed eating a room service steak.
text: The File Folder sits on the table.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Now in his undershirt and shorts, Whip lies propped up on the
text: bed watching television. The File Folder now rests on the
dialog: bed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHIP'S BATHROOM -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Whip is meticulously shaving. He stares a long while at the
text: disposable razor as the water runs over its blade. After a
text: moment he goes back to shaving.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHIP'S ROOM -- MUCH LATER
dialog: 
text: Whip sits at the small table looking through the file. He
text: leafs through photos, with no recognizable emotion. He looks
text: to the clock radio -- 12:37.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHIP'S ROOM -- BATHROOM -- LATER AGAIN
dialog: 
text: We hear the shower running and steam fogs the mirrors.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER THAN THAT
dialog: 
text: WHIP wears boxers and a tee shirt with a towel around his
text: neck. He looks to the clock -- 2:07
dialog: 
text: WE WATCH HIS SUIT BE PULLED FROM THE WARDROBE BAG.
dialog: 
text: WHIP lays the suit out neatly on the couch, separating the
text: shirt which he hangs from a light fixture to relax any
text: creases.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER YET AGAIN
dialog: 125.
dialog: 
text: The room is dark. A soft wind RATTLES the window sash.
text: WHIP lies on the bed. He sighs, sleep is alluding him and
text: the anxiety of tomorrow's events on no sleep has his head
text: spinning. He hears a metallic click. He stays quiet to
text: listen for it...there it is again. An annoying click.
dialog: 
text: The clock reads "3:43"--
dialog: 
text: He sits up and switches on the LIGHT. He rubs his eyes and
text: goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there. As
text: he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again.
text: He goes to investigate.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HOTEL ROOM CONNECTING DOOR -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: The connecting door is unlocked. WHIP arrives and waits. He
text: now watches as the connecting lock-bolt CLICKS against the
text: frame -- the door swinging in a draft. He looks up to see
text: the culprit -- a heating vent. WHIP flips the vent closed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Whip now pushes the door with his finger, opening it a few
text: inches. Nothing. Darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Hello? Anyone?
dialog: 
text: Whip enters.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CONNECTING HOTEL ROOM -- SAME
dialog: 
text: The room is vacant. The bed is made. The drapes are pulled
dialog: open.
dialog: 
text: WHIP walks quietly on the carpet towards the window. The
text: night is clear. Quiet. Whip takes in the city lights.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP'S POV --
dialog: 
text: Among the glass and steel office buildings, Whip spots a
text: church spire. A simple cross is perched on top.
dialog: 
text: Whip looks at the church, deep in thought.
dialog: 
dialog: Then suddenly...
dialog: 
text: We HEAR A HUM. THE GENTLE HUM OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR.
dialog: 
text: WHIP turns from the window and scans the room...
dialog: 
text: It's the MINI-BAR refrigerator -- HUMMING to life.
dialog: 126.
dialog: 
text: Whip stares at the gleaming black box. The WHIR of the motor
text: seems to get LOUDER. Calling Whip. Beckoning him...
dialog: 
text: Whip looks at the fridge. His face is blank, His eyes tell us
dialog: nothing. Then...
dialog: 
text: Whip steps toward the box.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR. Whip swings open the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WHOOSH -- OUR DARK SCREEN LIGHTS.
dialog: 
text: COLORS SPARKLE as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles GLOW like
text: jewels in a chest.
dialog: 
text: WHIP stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time --
text: vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER,
scene_heading: CRYSTAL, EMERALD, RUBY.
dialog: 
text: WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently
text: pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the
text: fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it.
dialog: 
text: Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White
text: Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists
text: the tiny cap back on.
dialog: 
text: With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted
text: mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away.
dialog: 
text: WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE. The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small
text: bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side
text: -- ever so slowly, slowly. Then suddenly...
dialog: 
text: WHAP!!! In a flash, WHIP SCOOPS THE VODKA OUT OF FRAME!!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - ELEVATOR DOORS - MORNING
dialog: 
text: The ELEVATOR DOORS open and HUGH and CHARLIE step out and
text: head down the hallway.
dialog: 
text: We follow our guys as they approach WHIP's room, finding
text: OFFICER EDMONDS exactly where we left him -- in front of
text: WHIP's door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - HALLWAY - WHIP'S DOOR - DAY
dialog: 
text: OFFICER EDMONDS stands up as CHARLIE and HUGH approach
text: carrying coffees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Good morning, how's our man?
dialog: 127.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER EDMONDS
text: Not a peep.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits
text: for WHIP to answer. CHARLIE cocks his head, knocks again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I think your pilot overslept.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: You didn't let any girls in there
dialog: last night did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER EDMONDS
dialog: No sir, not a soul. No one came in
dialog: or out.
dialog: 
text: They all wait awkwardly as HUGH checks his watch and knocks
text: on the door. More silence...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER EDMONDS (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a room key.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE takes the room key and lets himself in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE carefully enters WHIP's room. He is spooked by the
text: silence. HUGH joins him as they take in the room. The bed
text: looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests
text: politely on the dining table but WHIP is nowhere to be found.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH LANG
dialog: Did he disappear?
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE tentatively walks around the empty room, the
text: bathroom, the closet, until he finally sees the adjoining
text: room door. He turns to HUGH with a surprised look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Whip? Hello?
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door. No
text: response, so CHARLIE lightly tosses the door open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ADJOINING ROOM -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE looks in to find the scene of the crime. Smoke still
text: hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every
text: surface in the room. HUGH joins him...
dialog: 128.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Where is he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Whip? WHIP!
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE closes his eyes and says a silent prayer as he heads
dialog: for the bathroom...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: BATHROOM -- ADJOINING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE is stopped by the sight of WHIP's lifeless body
text: wedged between the tub and the toilet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: WHIP?!!! WHIP!!!
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE turns WHIP over to see his non-responsive face. HUGH
text: arrives and freaks out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Is he dead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I DON'T KNOW!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: IS HE DEAD?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yes!!! I'm dead!!!
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE shows immediate relief that WHIP is breathing.
text: OFFICER EDMONDS has joined them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER EDMONDS
dialog: Should I get an ambulance?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Wait!...just wait, Charlie...let's
dialog: think about this.
dialog: 
text: The two stare at each other and realize they are both
text: breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their
dialog: predicament.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Get him to the bed...
dialog: (to the Officer)
dialog: 129.
dialog: 
dialog: Can you wait outside and don't let
dialog: anyone in here? Thank you.
dialog: 
text: EDMONDS leaves. CHARLIE and HUGH drag WHIP out of the
text: bathroom and flop him on the bed. HUGH explodes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Son of a bitch! You worthless
dialog: motherfucker, what a waste! I
dialog: cleared the decks for you...you
dialog: piece of shit. You just fucked it
dialog: all up like the piss drunk you are!
dialog: 
text: HUGH grabs at WHIP's collar and WHIP actually sits up and
text: reaches for HUGH, a nice sign of life from WHIP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: WOAH!!! WOAH!!! WOAH!!! Enough!
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE pulls HUGH away from WHIP who falls back on the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What time is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
text: 9:14, the hearing is in 46 minutes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How much grace do you think we got?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Amazing grace...how sweet the
dialog: sound...that saved a wretch like me-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Shut the fuck up you drunk...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I once was lost and now I'm found
dialog: was blind but...now...well I'm
dialog: still kinda blind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We probably have an hour before we
dialog: really need to get him to the
text: hearing and it's just downstairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: We need a wheel chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Call Harling Mays.
dialog: 130.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Harling's got a wheel chair?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Harling's got cocaine.

speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Cocaine? Cocaine?!
dialog: 
text: HUGH and CHARLIE exchange a desperate look...

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Harling? Harling this is Charlie.
dialog: I'm a friend of Whip's...yeah. We
dialog: need you to do a very early, very
dialog: discreet...uhm...Whip needs bananas
dialog: and you need to bring them to The

dialog: 3 is the answer I'm getting -- you
dialog: will be well compensated...the The

dialog: 
text: CHARLIE hangs up and looks at WHIP who is mostly passed out
text: again. CHARLIE looks to HUGH.
dialog: 131.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE. ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR BANK -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: The elevator opens and we see HARLING step from the elevator
text: with his knapsack over his shoulder. Teva sandals,
dialog: sunglasses.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: WHIP has a towel around his neck as he tries to sip coffee.
text: CHARLIE sits opposite him at the small table by the window.
dialog: 
text: The door bursts open, and HARLING storms in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: Come mista tally man tally me
dialog: banana...Whip, what's the deal man
dialog: you look like you're hurtin' for
text: certain...shut the door, interior

dialog: 
text: HARLING places a leather doctor's bag on the table. An
text: anxious CHARLIE reaches for the bag which sets HARLING into a
dialog: frenzy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE MERCH
dialog: MOTHERFUCKER!!!
dialog: 
text: It's quiet as HARLING gives orders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone except Whip and myself
dialog: take three steps away from the
dialog: table.
dialog: 
text: As they step away, HARLING now pulls a beautiful silver-
text: framed mirror from his bag and a blue coke grinder, he calmly
text: but sternly delivers orders...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: I need three things.
dialog: (focuses on Charlie)
text: Two glasses of water, a credit card
dialog: and a hundred dollar bill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: All I have is a twenty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: (takes the card and bill)
dialog: That'll do. And I need to make a
dialog: coco puff.
dialog: 132.
dialog: 
text: HARLING Tosses a pack of smokes to CHARLIE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A what?
dialog: 
text: HUGH takes the smokes from CHARLIE and pulls out a cigarette.
dialog: 
text: HARLING stops grinding, opens the lid and pours out a nice
text: smooth pile of coke. He begins a masterful ballet of cocaine
dialog: manipulation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Millions of dollars hang in the
dialog: balance.
dialog: 
text: HUGH is removing the last quarter of an inch of tobacco from
text: the end of the cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: They hang on the consumption of a
text: 300 dollar bag of cocaine.
dialog: 
text: HARLING uses the credit card to groom the coke into neat
text: piles and lines. He has a system.
dialog: 
text: WHIP's head sags as he again appears ready to pass out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS
dialog: Okay Whip, just two small whiffs
dialog: first...one on each side...just a
dialog: primer.
dialog: 
text: Using the mirror as a tray, HARLING holds the rolled up 20
text: dollar bill just above the line of coke. WHIP slowly manages
text: to place his face in position to ingest the coke. It's tense
text: as his head wobbles. He finally zeroes in and snorts the
text: first line. HARLING quickly switches nostrils. WHIP sniffs
text: the other side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: Atta boy, head back now. Swallow.
dialog: Water, chief, you! Water.
dialog: 
text: CHARLIE puts the glass of water to WHIP's mouth. WHIP
dialog: drinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: (snaps his fingers)
dialog: Coco puff...
dialog: 
text: HUGH hands HARLING the cigarette with a slightly hollowed out
text: tip. HARLING leans over the coke with the cigarette in his
text: mouth and hoovers up a small pile, sucking the coke through
dialog: the cigarette.
dialog: 133.
dialog: 
text: HARLING sits up, careful to keep the cocaine in the end of
text: the cigarette. He tips it up and lights it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: Little coco puff buddy. C'mon
dialog: banana man. Who's the banana man?
dialog: 
text: WHIP's head levels a look to Harling with a smile that leads
dialog: us to believe that he is actually making a rally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: Good man, focus up big dog. Here's
dialog: the train comin' to you.
dialog: 
text: HARLING takes a puff and holds it as he extends the cocaine
text: cigarette to WHIP. WHIP is more nimble now as he cocks his
text: head in acceptance of the cigarette. WHIP takes a drag and
dialog: holds it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARLING MAYS (CONT'D)
dialog: (still holding the smoke)
dialog: Keep it down big dog, banana boat's
dialog: comin' tell me the banana boat's

text: 133 The opening bars of Joe Cocker's "Feelin' Alright" crackle 133
text: just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and begin
text: a relatively steady strut down the hallway. Deja Vu.
text: Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank
text: him from a few steps behind. Further back we can see that

dialog: the elevator.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Morning.
dialog: 
text: We watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from WHIP's left
text: nostril. HUGH pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, hands it
dialog: to WHIP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH
dialog: Your nose...
dialog: 
text: WHIP accepts the handkerchief and wipes his nose. WHIP sees
text: blood on the cloth and tilts his head back.
dialog: 135.
dialog: 
text: We now see that there is a mirrored ceiling to the elevator.
text: WHIP tries to study his reflection in the ceiling as he holds

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Do not tell me how to lie about my

scene_heading: INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - BALL ROOM - NTSB HEARING-DAY
dialog: 
text: On TWO LARGE SCREENS we watch the grainy cell phone footage
text: shot by a witness of SOUTHJET FLIGHT 227's final moments in
text: the sky. ACCOMPANYING the Video is the REAL AUDIO of the
dialog: cockpit voice recording...
dialog: 
text: The room has a dais where the NTSB board members sit. A
text: large blue curtain is the backing for the round NTSB shield
text: that hangs above the proceedings. A large drop down screen
dialog: will show images, graph and text as needed by the NTSB.
dialog: 
text: A confident woman, ELLEN BLOCK, approaches carrying a file
text: which she lays on the podium.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Those are difficult images to
dialog: watch. For the record, I'm Ellen
dialog: Block, Hearing Officer for this
dialog: hearing. Captain Whitaker, good
dialog: morning.
dialog: 136.
dialog: 
text: We see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Morning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: What was captured on that video is
dialog: that the aircraft was in a
dialog: relatively stable glide just prior
dialog: to the moment of impact.
dialog: However, according to the data we
dialog: retrieved from the cockpit data
text: recorders, at exactly 9:34, after
dialog: flying 27 minutes without incident,
dialog: the transponder recorded a loss in
dialog: altitude in excess of 4800 feet per
dialog: minute in what is considered a
dialog: "full pitch nose down" attitude.
dialog: Then at 9:42, according to the data
dialog: recorders, a decision was made to
text: invert the aircraft. The NTSB has
dialog: created animated simulation that I
dialog: would like to play at this point.
dialog: 
text: ELLEN points to the screen...
dialog: 
text: An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow
text: it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the
text: real audio of the flight crew.
dialog: 
text: The animation has a split screen that also shows the
text: instruments and printed text of what's being said.
dialog: 
dialog: We hear..."What's your son's name?" "Why?" "The black box"
dialog: "I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you." "What
dialog: are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!" "We're gonna roll
dialog: it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control."
dialog: 
text: That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops
text: and the lights come back up. We return to the hearing in
dialog: progress.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: That audio is tragic and
dialog: compelling. I chose to play that
text: part of the cockpit recording to
dialog: highlight a key moment aboard
dialog: flight 227, wherein you say "We're
dialog: gonna roll it, here we go, I've got
dialog: control." You made a very
dialog: conscious decision to invert the
dialog: airplane, to roll the plane upside
dialog: down. Is that correct?
dialog: 137.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I'm not sure it was conscious. It
dialog: was more of an instinct.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: What led to that decision?
dialog: 
text: WHIP is clearly struggling in his chair. The coke got him
text: there but it may start to fail him soon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I don't recall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Let me quote from an investigative
dialog: summary..."From 9:34 until 9:42 the
dialog: events on the aircraft are"...again
dialog: I quote, "bold and remarkable"...
dialog: "By inverting the plane, Captain
dialog: Whitaker arrested the descent and
dialog: allowed the aircraft to level off
dialog: enabling him to glide the aircraft
dialog: away from any populated areas and
dialog: allowing him to execute a forced
text: landing in an open field.
dialog: 
text: We hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions
dialog: are remarkable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I heard a metallic bang. We
text: pitched nose down. No control.
dialog: 
text: WHIP looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still
text: coursing through his exhausted frame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: You had no idea what was wrong with
dialog: the aircraft?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: There was a lot of things wrong
dialog: with that aircraft.
dialog: 
text: WHIP glances towards HUGH and CHARLIE who are poker-faced.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: As I said before you can add any
dialog: details you like to any comments I
dialog: make. Do you remember any thing
dialog: else that was out of the ordinary?
dialog: Did you feel the flight crew was in
dialog: their best shape?
dialog: 138.
dialog: 
text: WHIP takes a minute to digest this question.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: It was raining very hard the
dialog: morning you took off, wasn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: There was some convective activity
dialog: in the area. However, my first
dialog: officer and I discussed the
dialog: conditions on the field and
dialog: determined that we were safely
dialog: within our visibility and crosswind
dialog: minimums.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Yes, first officer Evans' testimony
text: confirms the same.
dialog: 
text: WHIP goes quiet as ELLEN BLOCK looks at him over her glasses,
text: seeing if he has any reaction. WHIP smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to show you something.
dialog: 
text: HUGH is frozen in a steely gaze; CHARLIE seems to hold his
dialog: breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Nothing's happening.
dialog: 
text: ELLEN points her remote at the projector but it doesn't work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: This remote is not working.
dialog: Apologies. I can do it manually.
dialog: 
text: She shrugs and heads down onto the stage closer to WHIP where
text: she can advance the slides by touching the projector.
dialog: 
text: We now see a screen where a slide is showing a long metal
text: screw the size of a trombone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
text: This is the jackscrew on the tail
dialog: assembly which articulates the
dialog: horizontal stabilizer--also known
dialog: as the elevator. As you can see,
dialog: the threads on this screw are
dialog: almost entirely gone. "
dialog: 139.
dialog: 
dialog: Substandard thread life" is how we
dialog: reported it. This part was
dialog: suggested as a maintenance
dialog: replacement in January of 2010. It
dialog: was never replaced.
dialog: 
dialog: This had 1200 additional hours of
text: flight on it. It finally failed.
dialog: 
text: AN ANIMATION SHOWS THE TAIL ASSEMBLY.
dialog: 
text: We watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes
text: up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Our investigators have concluded
dialog: that the jackscrew snapped and the
text: elevator was frozen in a fixed
text: position, locking the elevator in a
dialog: down position which forced the
text: plane into a dive. The loss of the
dialog: elevator was, and I quote our
dialog: report, a "catastrophic event, from
dialog: which recovery was improbable and
dialog: stable flight impossible."
dialog: 
text: Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate. ELLEN's tone
text: changes as she understands how hard this is for some people
dialog: to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last
dialog: living minutes on this earth in sheer terror.
dialog: 
text: It is deathly quiet in the ballroom. Even the PRESS are
dialog: silent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Again I quote..."From 9:34 until
dialog: 9:42 the piloting decisions made by
dialog: Captain Whitaker were bold and
dialog: remarkable. The fact that Captain
dialog: Whitaker commanded that the
text: aircraft stay inverted while
text: descending to an extremely low
text: altitude shows a miraculous
dialog: intuition that in this instance
dialog: saved 96 lives."
dialog: 
text: A genuine applause spreads from the hearing room. ELLEN
text: BLOCK allows this moment to happen.
dialog: 
text: WHIP is fading, dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected
text: adulation. He stands up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I appreciate that.
dialog: 140.
dialog: 
text: The room gets quiet as WHIP's demeanor seems terse.
dialog: 
text: WHIP stares at ELLEN, white with sweat and chemicals. We see
text: HUGH grind his jaw as this line of questioning has him on
dialog: tilt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Mr. Whitaker, I want to talk about
dialog: the days leading and hours leading
dialog: up to the accident. But before I
dialog: do, I want to remind you that you
dialog: are under oath and any testimony
dialog: that you give here today will be
dialog: considered admissable in any
dialog: subsequent hearings or criminal
dialog: proceedings, do you understand what
dialog: that means?
dialog: 
text: WHIP nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Captain Whitaker, for the record I
dialog: need you to verbalize your answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yes, I understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: On the three days leading up to the
dialog: day of the accident -- Tuesday,
dialog: October 11th, Wednesday, October
dialog: 12th or Thursday, October 13th of
dialog: 2011 -- did you consume any alcohol
dialog: or other intoxicating elements?
dialog: 
text: WHIP takes his time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: No. I did not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HUGH AND CHARLIE
dialog: 
text: Sit stone faced in the second row feeling the relief of
dialog: months of hard work.
dialog: 
text: ELLEN BLOCK continues with a rote posture...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: On the morning of the accident,
dialog: Friday, October 14th, did you
dialog: consume any alcohol or ingest any
dialog: chemicals or drugs that may have
dialog: impaired your ability to perform
dialog: your job?
dialog: 141.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: No. I did not.
dialog: 
text: ELLEN wraps up this line of questions...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have
dialog: you ever had a problem with alcohol
dialog: dependency, alcoholism or drug
dialog: addiction?
dialog: 
text: WHIP waits for her to look at him...this takes a while...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: HUGH maintains a poker face; CHARLIE appears relieved.
dialog: 
text: ELLEN sorts through her notes one last time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about
dialog: done.
dialog: (She refers to her notes)
dialog: Due to the severe turbulence during
dialog: the early part of the flight, you
dialog: asked the flight crew to suspend
text: the beverage service on the plane.
dialog: Is that correct?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yes. I suspended the drink
dialog: service.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Are you aware that our
dialog: investigators found two single-
text: service Vodka bottles in the galley
dialog: trash bin?
dialog: 
text: Slides now show the TWO SMALL VODKA BOTTLES in evidence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: There were 5 crew members on board
dialog: the flight who would have had
text: access to the beverage trolley.
dialog: Less than an hour after the
dialog: accident, blood was taken from each
dialog: of the crew members. Yourself...
dialog: 142.
dialog: 
text: A SOUTHJET CORPORATE PHOTO OF WHIP pops on to the large
text: monitors. After ELLEN references a member of the flight
text: crew, their photo pops on to the monitors...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: First Officer Evans, flight
dialog: attendant Margaret Thomason and
dialog: posthumously from Camelia Satou and
dialog: Katerina Marquez.
dialog: 
text: KATERINA MARQUEZ PHOTO does not pop up on the screen...yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: A toxicology analysis was performed
dialog: and three of these tests came back
dialog: negative, one was disqualified for
dialog: technical reasons...
dialog: 
text: Hugh smiles -- satisfied.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: And one tested positive for
dialog: alcohol. It registered a .17 blood
dialog: alcohol level. Are you aware of
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I am now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Miss Marquez was not only a
dialog: colleague, but you knew her outside
dialog: of work? Correct?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Outside of work? Not really.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Did you know Miss Marquez had a
dialog: drinking problem?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: No. I did not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Did you ever see her drink to
dialog: excess?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: No. I did not.
dialog: 143.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Did you know that she was twice
dialog: treated for alcohol addiction? The
dialog: last time was 16 months ago and
dialog: paid for by SouthJet Airlines?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: No. I did not.
dialog: 
text: A picture of Trina's beautiful smiling face FLASHES UP ON THE
scene_heading: BIG SCREEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Is it your opinion that Katerina
dialog: Marquez drank the vodka on the
dialog: plane?
dialog: 
text: WHIP smiles at the photo of TRINA as if she can see him. He
text: then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great
text: spirit. He gets serious as he bears his look down on ELLEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: Can you repeat the question?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Your opinion Captain. Is it your
dialog: opinion that Katerina Marquez drank
dialog: on that flight?
dialog: 
text: Whip shakes. He runs his trembling hand through his hair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I'm sorry. My what...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Since her toxicology report is the
dialog: only toxicology report that is
dialog: admissable in this hearing, and she
dialog: in fact tested positive for
dialog: alcohol, is it your opinion that
dialog: Katerina Marquez drank those 2
dialog: bottles of vodka on the flight?
dialog: 
text: Whip drops his head and MUTTERS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry Mr. Whitaker, I couldn't
dialog: hear you. What did you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I SAID...God help me...
dialog: 144.
dialog: 
text: A confused MUMBLE rises in the room. Whip's response
text: flusters ELLEN for a moment, but she recovers quickly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Yes, well. However, is it your
dialog: opinion...
dialog: 
text: Whip cuts her off...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
speaker_heading: (EXCESSIVELY LOUD)
dialog: IT'S MY OPINION...
dialog: (lowers his voice)
dialog: It's my opinion...
dialog: Trina DID NOT...drink the vodka.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: (softly, to himself)
dialog: She saved that boy's life...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Captain Whitaker can you speak
speaker_heading: LOUDER-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
speaker_heading: (LOUD AGAIN)
dialog: I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE DID NOT
dialog: DRINK THAT VODKA...
dialog: 
text: Whip stops. His whole body trembles, his face tightens. He
text: looks right at ELLEN...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: ...because I did. I drank the
dialog: vodka.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: OBJECTION!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NTSB OFFICER #2
dialog: Please be seated sir. This is not a

dialog: 
text: Now CHARLIE returns to his chair to find that HUGH is gone.
text: CHARLIE looks around for HUGH, no sign. He's vanished.
dialog: 
text: WHIP leans close to the microphone.
dialog: 145.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I drank the vodka bottles on the
dialog: plane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Mr. Whitaker, in light of that
dialog: remark, would you like to
dialog: readdress...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: You don't have to readdress
dialog: anything. I DRANK THE VODKA!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: On the three nights before the
dialog: accident, October 11th-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: On October 11th, 12th and 13th and
dialog: 14th I was intoxicated. I drank
dialog: alcohol on all of those days. I
dialog: drank to excess.

speaker_heading: ELLEN BLOCK
dialog: Mr. Whitaker, on the morning of
speaker_heading: OCTOBER-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I was drunk. I'm drunk right now,
dialog: Miss Block...I'm drunk right...
dialog: (Whip finally breaks down)
dialog: I'm drunk now, because...
dialog: Because I'm an alcoholic.
dialog: 
text: We have pushed into a tight shot on WHIP's face as the sound
text: in the room fades away. We stay tight on WHIP's face as he
text: lets the moments unfold.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the noise cuts to silence. WHIP is looking at the
text: assembly. WHIP wipes tears from his eyes. We hear WHIP's
text: voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (V.O.)
dialog: That was it...I was done. It's as
dialog: if I'd hit my life long limit for
dialog: lies.
dialog: 
text: A new angle shows WHIP speaking these words...
dialog: 146.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I could not tell one more lie. And
dialog: maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I
dialog: had just told one more lie? I could
dialog: have walked away from that whole
dialog: mess and kept my wings and my false
dialog: sense of pride and most importantly
dialog: I would have avoided being locked
dialog: up here with all of you nice folks
dialog: for the last 13 months.
dialog: 
text: We hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he
text: is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA
text: meeting in a Federal Prison.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: It looks like I will serve every
dialog: day of the remaining 4 plus years
dialog: of my sentence. And that's fair.
dialog: I betrayed the public trust. I
dialog: did. That's what the judge
dialog: explained to me. I had betrayed
dialog: the public trust. The FAA took my
dialog: license. And that's fair. The
dialog: chances of me flying again are slim
dialog: to none. And I accept that.

speaker_heading: WHIP
dialog: I've had time to think about all of
dialog: it. Doing a lot of writing. I've
dialog: written letters to each of the
dialog: families that lost loved ones on my
dialog: flight. Some were able to hear my
dialog: apology, some never will.
dialog: I've also apologized to all the
dialog: people who tried to help me along
dialog: the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't
dialog: listen, like my wife, I mean my ex
dialog: wife...
dialog: (he gets emotional)
dialog: ...and my son. Again, some were
dialog: able to forgive me...some never
dialog: will.
speaker_heading: (COLLECTS HIMSELF)
dialog: But at least I'm sober, and I'm
dialog: grateful for that.
dialog: 
dialog: Whip gives it to us straight...

speaker_heading: WHIP (CONT'D)
dialog: And this is gonna sound really
dialog: stupid coming from a man who's in

dialog: my life...I'm free.
dialog: 
text: We hold close on WHIP's face as we hear the metallic clang of
text: prison doors shutting. On the sound we cut to...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- CELL -- DAY
dialog: 
text: We pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small,
text: personal photo collage. We see a photo of NICOLE and SHEILA
text: and a few other AA FOLKS surrounding WHIP who sits in front
text: of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison. We see
text: a photo of WHIP's DAD as an airman. We ultimately land on a
text: photo of NICOLE. We recognize it as the photo WHIP took on
text: the porch of the Whitaker Farm.
dialog: 
text: We pan down to find WHIP writing in a journal. A GUARD comes
text: to the front of his cell.
