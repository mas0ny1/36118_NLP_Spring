dialog: Accurately, patiently wielded.
scene_heading: INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS
text: X-CLOSE. A SCALPEL returned to its place in a neat array
text: of TAXIDERMY TOOLS. Long surgical TWEEZERS taken. A steady
text: HAND grasps a CLAY BIRD FORM. Then sets the second eye.
dialog: Unhurried. Meticulous.
text: A MYSTERY MAN, features obscured, sets the tweezers aside,
text: reaches for a black lump on the table, revealed to be shiny
text: feathers as he wraps it around the form. Adjusts it so the
text: glass eyes peer out through holes in the skin of this large
dialog: CROW. A taxidermy specimen.
text: WIDE, the man works across the room under the pooled light
text: of a draftsman's lamp, the Crow on the table in front of

speaker_heading: SLOW FADE OUT.
scene_heading: EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: X-WIDE. "THE WALLS" like a medieval castle above a throng

dialog: of movement--handheld placards and flickering candles
dialog: telegraph an imminent execution.
dialog: The group shifts amoeba like as... A LARGE MERCEDES

dialog: INSIDE THE BENZ NATHAN RANDALL, father of the victim
dialog: comforts ERIN RANDALL, seventeen year old sister, as she

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Why are there so many?
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Just hold on to me.

speaker_heading: GONZALEZ

text: Nathan pushes past Gonzalez, taking Erin's hand.
speaker_heading: GONZALEZ (CONT'D)
dialog: Erin. Your sister...
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Leave us alone!
text: The Reporter TURNS to the camera, not missing a beat.
speaker_heading: GONZALEZ
dialog: A difficult time for everyone

scene_heading: INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT
text: CLANG. The barred door opens and the cake swoops in, landing
text: on a small table next to a CHESS GAME in progress and an
dialog: untouched last meal. ADJUST to find...
dialog: ALEX CORVIS. Twenty-One today. Disarmingly appealing.
text: Peaceful. Simple clothes. He looks up from the game, at...
dialog: PETER WALSH, Alex's pro-bono attorney and only friend,
dialog: trying not to explode at this shit-eating stunt.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: He didn't order that.
speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: We found the man with the scar.
text: Despite himself, Alex looks up. Mercer gestures at... THE

text: with a large ZIGZAG marking on the forearm, also frosting.
text: FAVORING ALEX looking from the cake up to Mercer, who nods
dialog: at the candles.
speaker_heading: MERCER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Yes, I've come to a lot of these
dialog: over the years, but this one has
dialog: many unique aspects. Youth of the

dialog: three stab wounds. Kind of a record.
speaker_heading: GONZALEZ'S VOICE

speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN

text: talks to Gonzalez under the hot video light.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I don't fault him saying I lied on

speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: You ok?
text: Alex gets up, crosses to a small ledge on the other side
dialog: of the cell that holds a few books and pictures. He finds...
text: A PICTURE OF LAUREN AND ALEX In a grove of tall trees. A

text: RESUME Alex staring at the photo, taped to the wall.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What's been holding me together is
dialog: the hope that maybe you do go
dialog: someplace. And I'll be seeing her
dialog: again soon. Only what will I say?
dialog: That I was too stupid to find the
dialog: guy who killed her? That he's down
dialog: here laughing?
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: Tell her... we'll get him.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: We won't.

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

text: Erlich gives a long-suffering look. Like it's preposterous.
dialog: But he's too gentlemanly to say it.
speaker_heading: ERLICH (CONT'D)
dialog: We couldn't find him. And,
dialog: obviously, the jury didn't buy it.
speaker_heading: GONZALEZ
dialog: Some people here seem to.
speaker_heading: DUTTON
dialog: People here are protesting the
dialog: execution of a kid just turning
dialog: twenty-one. A kid who had a tough
dialog: life. No parents, no dough. Always
dialog: had to fight for everything. It's
dialog: a tragedy, it really is. But I

dialog: that's just me.
text: They look up as Mercer appears outside the barred door to
dialog: the cell, starts to unlock it.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: Your move.
speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: No. It's time.
dialog: It really is. Other prison personnel arrive outside the
dialog: cell in various uniforms:
text: A MINISTER with clerical collar, the WARDEN, two GUARDS.
dialog: Waiting. Walsh crosses, very emotional how. Gives Alex a
dialog: huge hug.
speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: MERCER

dialog: 6.
text: As Alex exits past Mercer, Walsh sits down on the cot.
text: He's hard to read a second until he lashes out, flips...

text: semi-intact as it hits the floor.
scene_heading: INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW
text: Dead Man Walking. A mini parade past the cells of the
text: condemned. One guard flanks Alex, another follows. The
dialog: Warden and Minister out in front.
text: HANDS extend from the other cells as Alex passes. Unable
text: to touch, but he reaches for them, a gesture of solidarity.
text: Mercer catches up with the group, flanking Alex cell-side.
text: Alex drops his hand, cut off even from that.
scene_heading: INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW #2 - NIGHT
text: The parade continues down another hallway.
scene_heading: INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATH CHAMBER - NIGHT
text: The CHAIR, an atavism, sits alone a moment before the

speaker_heading: MINISTER
dialog: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
dialog: not want...
dialog: THE MINISTER CONTINUES as...
text: CLOSE. Handstraps tightened. WHOP. WHOP. Alex squirms
text: despite his resolve. Through an act of will, calms himself.
dialog: Looks up at...
text: THE PHONE. On the wall. A last possibility of reprise.
text: CLOSE. Trouser legs slit. Footstraps tightened around bare
dialog: ankles. Electrodes checked.
text: CLOSE. Chest strap tightened. Yanked again for good measure.
text: ALEX gasps. It's hard to breathe now with the strap tight
dialog: across his chest.
text: CLOSE. Copper mesh. Pieces of sponge jerry-sewn onto it,
dialog: the irregular stitching giving it an unsettling natural
dialog: appearance.
dialog: ADJUST to REVEAL this is the electrode in the odd leather
text: HELMET tightened now on Alex's head.
text: THE EXECUTIONER. Pulls a hood over his own obscured face.

scene_heading: ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PLEXI - THE OBSERVATION ROOM REVEALED
speaker_heading: as the CURTAINS OPEN.
text: Two dozen observers crammed into a space the width of a
dialog: singlewide trailer. Erin. Her father. The Cops. Tommy
dialog: Leonard. Gonzalez and other media types. Prison personnel.
text: Every seat occupied. Sweaty and surreal. All looking at
text: him. IN THE DEATH CHAMBER The Warden steps forward.
speaker_heading: WARDEN
dialog: Alexander Frederick Corvis. Do you
dialog: have any last words?
text: A thick silence. Alex looks unprepared, uneasy as he scans
text: a sea of hostile faces, settling on Erin and her dad.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I loved Lauren. I still do. I'm
dialog: innocent.
text: Erin shakes her head, disgusted. Looks away.
text: ALEX'S POV - THE LAST SECONDS OF HIS LIFE SLOWING in his
text: inner perception, movement ramping down as Alex scans the
dialog: disbelieving faces.
dialog: The Phone. Silent. No reprise. The Observation Room witness
text: door opens. A Guard in the back row deferentially offers
dialog: his seat to the NEW ARRIVAL, a man in dark clothes, his
text: face obscured by REFLECTIONS in the plexiglass. As he
text: UNBUTTONS his shirt cuff...
text: The warden steps to the side of the room, nods to the
text: executioner who lifts a COVER off a large switch.
text: The New Arrival pulls his shirtsleeve back over his forearm,
dialog: exposing a scar for Alex, THE SCAR, an odd zigzag pattern
dialog: of raised welts, a pattern deliberately formed of skin.
text: The Executioner throws the switch. ON ALEX SHAKING violently
dialog: as he fights to stay alive, time extremely subjective now
dialog: as he chokes out...
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: (indistinct, filtered)
dialog: Murderer!
text: The word bubbles up as if from underwater, audible only to
text: Alex. Alex wrenches his head, a superhuman act of will
dialog: trying to ID the Scar Man through the reflections.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 8.
text: THE HELMET starts to smoke. Then a burst of FLAME at Alex's
dialog: head.
text: A BOTCHED EXECUTION made worse by Alex's struggle to see,
dialog: to stay alive.
text: IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The observers panic, horrified.
text: Only the Scar Man calm as he covers his arm, rebuttons his
dialog: shirt. Face always obscured.
text: IN THE DEATH CHAMBER Alex in electro-spasm, smoke filling
text: the room, the warden in real time now as he runs to pull
dialog: the curtain closed.
text: It JAMS partway across. ALEX expires in the char,
text: grotesquely burned, EYES OPEN as the Warden finally yanks
dialog: the curtain closed.
text: IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The Scar Man slips out, but the
text: rest remain, transfixed, horrified. Erin and others in
text: tears. HOLD a long beat, their GASPS faintly audible.

speaker_heading: MERCER
dialog: That, my friend, is a deterrent.

dialog: convulsed in a pugilistic attitude.
scene_heading: INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT
text: The guards swing the gurney to a stop by a steel locker,
text: one of several. Mercer opens the locker door. The

text: BANG. The body hits the open door. Convulsed as it is, the

scene_heading: EYE'S POV - THROUGH A MAGNIFYING GLASS A coarse ZIGZAG
dialog: stitch shaped like the Scar runs the length of the Crow's

scene_heading: INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT
text: INSIDE THE LOCKER. A human EYE BLINKS. Barely visible in
dialog: the darkness. Alex KICKS with a YELL and...
text: IN THE MORGUE. The locker door flies open and Alex spills
text: onto the floor. Gropes a few seconds on hands and knees
text: before a SHADOW passes over him evoking a primitive
text: response. He cowers, looks up at...
text: A LARGE CROW flutters through the bars of a high window,
text: lands near him on the floor. It looks at him, then flaps
text: its way up to the autopsy countertop, cocks its head. Follow
dialog: me.
dialog: ALEX strains to pull himself up on the gurney that brought
dialog: him here.
text: HIS POV as he slowly rises above the gurney--the Crow in
text: front of a mirror over the splash sink. It flies off,

text: ALEX drops back to the floor with a SCREAM. Turns, sees
text: himself in a stainless door and SMASHES it with his fist...
text: THE BASHED STAINLESS DOOR the word "MORGUE," painted on
text: the wall behind Alex, brought into focus at the center of
text: the concavity. ALEX thrashes, trying to avoid his
text: reflection, but the dim mirrors have him surrounded.
text: THE CROW flaps down, crazed too, as if in empathy. CAWING
text: loudly, finally getting Alex's attention. ALEX settles,
text: hazards another look at his reflection in stainless steel.
text: His body looks less misshapen now. He looks at his arms,
text: hands, no longer burned. Pulls himself up on the gurney
dialog: again, cautiously.
text: OVER ALEX as he slowly rises above the gurney a second
text: time, looks in the mirror. His body miraculously HEALED,

dialog: off in one painful OVERCRANKED movement and...
text: OVER ALEX, IN THE MIRROR It's Alex, and yet not. His face
text: marked with the Crow MASK, jagged WARPAINT where the melted

speaker_heading: BLEEDING STOPS.
text: Alex follows the Crow into the dark room packed with file

text: Alex keeps coming, right up to the gun. Pointed right at
dialog: his face, then...
text: WHOOSH. Alex flips it around, RAMS the gun in Dutton's
dialog: mouth. He couldn't talk if he wanted to.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I'm working on it.
dialog: BAM! We HEAR the blast as we... CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT
dialog: BAM BAM continues, but these are TOY GUNS, fired in synch
speaker_heading: with POUNDING MUSIC.
text: In the hands of TWO STRIPPERS. Topless, leather G's and
dialog: chokers, black stockings, POLICE HATS on their heads, law
dialog: enforcement stars for earrings.
text: The CAPACITY CROWD responds as they pout, wield their
dialog: weapons.
text: AT THE ENTRANCE - MADDEN a straightfaced plainclothes
dialog: detective, more upscale than the clientele, flashes a BADGE
text: at a BOUNCER who scowls, lets him pass.
dialog: WITH MADDEN circumnavigating the mainstage, where the cop-
text: strippers are waving handcuffs now. At the edge of the
dialog: room, LAP-DANCERS pull one-on-one's for twenties. Madden
dialog: exits...
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: BACKSTAGE Madden moves past girls in various stages of
text: undress. Smoking, yapping, waiting to go onstage. One looks
text: up, interested, but he doesn't look back, exits into...
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY
dialog: AN INTERNET PORN FACILITY Where "live" sex workers man
dialog: tiny fantasy sets--a Dungeon, a Shower, a desk and
dialog: blackboard meant to suggest a Schoolroom. Crudely built,
dialog: but good enough for 500x800 pixel resolution. Madden stops
dialog: a second, looking...
scene_heading: OVER A MONITOR - THE DUNGEON SET UPDATES every six seconds,
dialog: the slowly changing low-rez version of the action on the
text: set--a woman tied to a chair with bright surgical tubing.
text: The picture refreshes and BG, the woman sneaks an expertly
text: timed sip of Diet Coke, puts the can away before the picture
dialog: updates again.
text: A COUNTER shows 132,768 hits and climbing. Madden gives a

scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT
text: A BACK HALL dark, the furthest recesses of the building.
text: Madden continues cautiously toward... A DOOR
scene_heading: INT. THE HOLE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT
text: The door is cracked open. Madden moving very quietly now,
text: scowling as he peers through the slight opening.
text: Three guys and whirring machines counting stacks of money.
text: Guns on the tabletops, in holsters, out of reach.
text: The door flies open.
speaker_heading: MADDEN
dialog: Police!
text: A moment of panic as the guys bent over the machines freeze.
text: Raise their hands, slowly turn. Then lower their hands.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: You fuck. Don't do that.
dialog: It's Erlich, Larkin and Toomey. Three cops we met at the
dialog: execution. Erlich's cane nearby.
speaker_heading: MADDEN
dialog: How's the month end?
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Oh yes. Never been better.
speaker_heading: MADDEN
dialog: Where's Dutton?
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Probably parked near some high
dialog: school with a hardon. Fuck never
dialog: showed.
speaker_heading: MADDEN
dialog: Anyone at all curious why?
text: Erlich, Larkin and Toomey exchange a look. Madden goes to
dialog: one of the money counters and grabs...
text: A STACK OF TWENTIES tossed violently at the ceiling.
text: Larkin and Toomey scramble as the bills flutter down like
dialog: leaves, picking them up.
speaker_heading: MADDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: You leave the door open with two
dialog: hundred strangers out there! What's
dialog: it take for you guys to learn a
dialog: goddamn lesson?
speaker_heading: TOOMEY
dialog: No one saw anything, Mad.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: MADDEN
dialog: You know why Dutton's not here?
dialog: Rigor mortis! He's dead.
dialog: The Three exchange looks.
speaker_heading: MADDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: One shot to the head, then fifty
dialog: three stab wounds with a six inch
dialog: blade. Any deja vu here? Think
dialog: Corvus knife, missing from the
dialog: evidence room.
speaker_heading: TOOMEY
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: MADDEN
dialog: Since last night. As usual, you're
dialog: right on top of things.
speaker_heading: LARKIN
dialog: It was supposed to end when Corvis
dialog: died. Remember? The kid no one
dialog: would miss?
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Don't look at me, asshole.
speaker_heading: LARKIN
dialog: Hey, I didn't kill anybody.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Back off. I mean it.
speaker_heading: MADDEN
dialog: Shut up! Erlich and Larkin settle
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: MADDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Crime scene's a goddamn clusterfuck.
dialog: Every reporter in town's trying to
dialog: get a look at Dutton's body. I
dialog: suggest we get a line on this before
dialog: someone else does.
speaker_heading: LARKIN
dialog: Who'd give a shit about Corvis at
dialog: this point? Kid didn't have a friend
dialog: in the world even when he was alive.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: I can think of one.

speaker_heading: Gonzalez CONTINUES UNDER as...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Dad! Come in here!
text: The SOUND of footsteps racing down the hall.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: The cop who found the knife in
dialog: Corvis's car.
text: Randall riveted by the TV now.
speaker_heading: GONZALEZ
dialog: They're moving him now, body
dialog: covered. It would appear that thirty
dialog: seven year old Phillip Dutton is
dialog: dead in the line of duty...
dialog: ON THE TV the Newsteam and Gonzalez SHOVED back by COPS
dialog: running defense for the stretcher. Gonzalez grabs for the
dialog: sheet covering the body and...
text: NEWSCAM TIGHT on Dutton, as the sheet pulls down, partially
dialog: uncovering...
text: DUTTON'S HEAD: Comb-over hanging to the side. Blood dripping
dialog: from crude letters carved in his bald pate--the word
text: "DAISY." Quickly covered by a COP who yells at Gonzalez...
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Out of here! Now!
dialog: ... but through a digital miracle the "Daisy" frame has
text: been grabbed, and appears as a still now behind Gonzalez.
text: RESUME - FAVORING ERIN struck dumb by this.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: GONZALEZ
dialog: Shocking even for these mean
dialog: streets, the word "Daisy" apparently
dialog: cut into his head by the
dialog: perpetrator, still at large. A
dialog: name. Perhaps a message...
text: Gonzalez FADES UNDER as Erin backs away from the TV.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: What? What is it?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Lauren called me that when we were
dialog: little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Honey. It's doesn't mean anything.
dialog: It's not a message.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: That guy in the cemetery today
dialog: said he knew everything about
dialog: Lauren.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: It still doesn't mean...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: He said he'd prove it.
text: Off Randall, as he sits on the bed, thoughtful...
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT
text: WIDE. The ambulance drives off, lights flashing, and we
text: BOOM UP over the crime scene, over the Newsteam, revealing
text: the top of Dutton's cruiser, marked with a BLOODRED CROW.
text: Continuing upward, FINDING... The Crow, perched high on a

scene_heading: EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT
dialog: The Crow soaring through this lousy part of town.
scene_heading: EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
text: The Crow swoops in, lands on the roof of a low end brick

text: FINDING a CHESS SET mid-game near the open window as...
scene_heading: INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: I don't know about any knife. I'm
dialog: trying to forget that case.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Well someone isn't. They killed
dialog: Dutton.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: It wasn't me.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: No shit. You couldn't get close to
dialog: him. But I'm betting you know who
dialog: did. Who's into Corvis? Huh?
text: Erlich flips through a Rolodex, knocks it to the floor,
text: then picks up a PHONE LOG off the desk.
speaker_heading: ERLICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Not a lot of calls. Business slow?
text: He tosses the phone log out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
text: HIGH ANGLE. Watching the phone log fluttering down.
dialog: INCLUDE ALEX, sitting where the Crow was perched, wearing
text: Dutton's badge on his evolving costume.
text: Alex winces at the voices faint but audible from below.
speaker_heading: ERLICH'S VOICE
dialog: You're the only one gave a flying
dialog: fuck about him when he was alive.
speaker_heading: WALSH'S VOICE
dialog: Lauren Randall did.
speaker_heading: ERLICH'S VOICE
dialog: Hey. Bitches are crazy. Richer
dialog: they are, crazier they get.
dialog: "THE LIST" The name "Erlich, Vincent" crossed off now by
dialog: Alex.
scene_heading: INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Erlich limps through frame toward Walsh, grabs him roughly
dialog: by the collar.
speaker_heading: WALSH

speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Who is it?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: How about the real killer. You
dialog: think of that?
text: Erlich violently tosses Walsh crashing back toward the
text: window, falling by the chess board.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: If you're covering for someone,
dialog: that's jail time. I got my eye on
dialog: you.
text: Erlich exits, slamming the door behind him. Walsh starts
text: to get up, stops. Looking at his own eye level...
text: ALEX'S CHESS BOARD set up identically to the game in Alex's
text: cell, a piece of FOLDED PAPER protruding from under the
dialog: board. Walsh pulls it out.
dialog: It says "Q-->B5" WALSH makes the move, Queen to Bishop
dialog: Five. Smiles. Looks at...
dialog: THE PAPER UNFOLDED says "Check." Walsh sets it down in the
dialog: Chess Box next to...
text: THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN arms around each other in
dialog: the woods, smiling.
dialog: WALSH sensing something, a presence.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: Alex?
text: Walsh moves cautiously to the curtains, draws them back.
text: Nothing. He leans out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
dialog: CROWVISION: Starting on Walsh, popping his head out the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET #2 - INTERSECTION - NIGHT
text: A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT. The Porsche pulling to a stop.
text: IN THE PORSCHE Erlich looks down, presses a button on the

text: Erlich looks up, waves his arms.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: No, no...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 37.
text: ERLICH'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD A BUM starts to
dialog: "clean" the windshield with an OILY rag, leaving opaque
dialog: smears on the once clean glass.
text: THUD. A handful of gravelly MUD lands on the windshield,
text: starts to get smeared around. ERLICH pounding the window
dialog: from inside.
speaker_heading: ERLICH (CONT'D)
dialog: No! Shit!
text: The bum is giving the driver side window the same treatment.
text: Hard to see anything now. Erlich throws up his hands in
text: disgust, reaches for the door handle just as...
dialog: SMASH! The driver side window SHATTERS as something enters
text: at high speed KICKING Erlich across the car...
text: Erlich's head bounces off the passenger window, leaving a
text: BLOODY SMEAR. Alex in the driver seat now.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The Germans really know how to
dialog: make a car, don't they?
text: LOW ANGLE ON THE PORSCHE wheels spinning as it peels out.
scene_heading: INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT
text: WINDSHIELD WASHERS and WIPERS clear away the grime Alex
dialog: smeared on the windshield, revealing that we're rocketing
dialog: through a bad part of town.
text: MUSIC CONTINUES as Alex pulls the KNIFE out of his costume
text: with his LEFT HAND. It looks huge in the cramped sports
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (re: Lauren knife)
dialog: I heard you were looking for this.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: You're the guy killed Dutton.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I want you to think of me as the

text: Erlich pulls a .380 SEMI-AUTO stashed between the two seats.
dialog: Points it at Alex.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Stop the car.
dialog: Alex FLOORS it and... BAM.
text: Erlich blows a hole through Alex's LEFT ARM, a yawning
dialog: aperture through which Erlich watches the passing scenery
dialog: a few improbably seconds.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Ow.
text: The WOUND closes. Knife still in Alex's hand.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Fuck. Me.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What happened to your leg there
dialog: Officer? Hunting accident?
text: WHOP. In one swift move Alex impales the knife THROUGH
text: ERLICH'S WRIST, into his thigh. Erlich SCREAMS, tries to
text: remove the knife, but Alex keeps a firm grip on the handle.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Lauren Randall shot you trying to
dialog: get free. The fifty three stab
dialog: wounds she died of came from you.
dialog: Am I right? Ballpark?
text: Erlich tries to stay steely, yells louder as...
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET #2 - NIGHT
text: The Corvette bumps over a sidewalk, runs a red light.
text: A POLICE CRUISER going the other way pulls a stunt U, flips
text: on its lights. In hot pursuit.
scene_heading: INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT
text: Bumpier now as Alex's driving gets more and more erratic.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: In Saudi Arabia they cut off the

dialog: for a life? Two lives?
text: FLASH. Alex yanks the Knife out and FLASH, slices through
text: the left arm of Erlich's jacket, sawing into the FLESH.
dialog: Erlich's arm bleeding.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Not my arm! What you fucking want?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I want Lauren. I want my life back.
dialog: I want... to know why.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Why? Why's anything happen? It's
dialog: all money, man. Money. The girl
dialog: just got in the way.
text: Alex grimaces, then RIP, he yanks the sleeves off Erlich's
text: arm. Erlich looks down, surprised to see his arm intact.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The scar. Which of you has it?
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Nobody.
dialog: Alex poises the knife for another descent.
speaker_heading: ERLICH (CONT'D)
dialog: I swear. It's a bullshit fucking
dialog: story the loser boyfriend made up.
text: This gives Alex pause. He shakes his head, clearing the
dialog: reality glitch, looks up...
text: IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR Cop cars, lights flashing.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET #4 - NIGHT
text: The Corvette slides around a corner, screams into a final
text: straightaway that dead ends into the sloping concrete side
dialog: of an overpass.
text: The cops not far behind. The Porsche bottoming out on a
dialog: bump now ant...
scene_heading: INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT
text: Alex's sun visor falls partway down from the jolt. He
text: reaches to push it back into position and notices...
text: ON THE BACK OF THE VISOR The CAR REGISTRATION. Alex takes
text: it out of the holder. RESUME Alex suddenly calm. He reaches
dialog: down for...
text: THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER pushed in. The volume on the Elvis
text: song pumped up. ALEX relaxes back in his seat as they scream
dialog: toward the abutment.
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: Are you out of your fucking mind?
dialog: We're going to die.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How can you die if you're already
dialog: dead?
speaker_heading: ERLICH
dialog: You're him. Corvis.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I was talking about you.
text: Alex smiles as the CIGARETTE LIGHTER pops out. He grabs it
text: and the GLOW vanishes as he closes his fist around it.
text: Erlich turns front in horror. The microsecond of terror
text: realized as Elvis climaxes, the retaining wall zoomes in...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: ELVIS
dialog: My dream... comes true... right
dialog: now!
scene_heading: EXT. OVERPASS / ABUTMENT - NIGHT
text: WHAM! The Corvette hits at a million mph. Crumpling,
text: disintegrating, and hurling two bodies bouncing off the
dialog: abutment.
text: THE CAVALRY - CRUISERS AND PLAINWRAPS Too late. A half
text: dozen cars bearing down all lights and sirens. Screeching
text: to a halt by what used to be a silver Porsche. The ruptured
speaker_heading: gas tank spurting GASOLINE.
text: A CRUISER screeches to a halt. Both doors fly open. Toomey
text: and Larkin step out. Toomey on his radio as Larkin looks
dialog: up the embankment, catches a glimpse of...
text: ALEX battered but alive, jerkily unclenches his fist, still
text: holding the Lighter, glow fading. He tosses...
text: THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER arcs down onto the ex-Corvette. WIDER -
dialog: BOOM! Cops shield themselves as the Crash scene explodes
text: in a huge FIREBALL that engulfs a cruiser stopped too close
dialog: by.
text: IN THE TOO-CLOSE COP CAR the DRIVER rams the car into
text: REVERSE. Tires squeal as the fireball hits and...
text: THE TOO-CLOSE CRUISER Engine compartment ignites, a second
text: fireball racing backward into another Cruiser. BOOM!
text: Total chaos now. LARKIN focussed on Alex, seen vaguely
text: through the flames. Moving toward him.
text: WITH LARKIN as he arrives at the top of the enbankment,
text: draws his weapon. Hyperalert. Alex is gone, but he finds...
text: ERLICH'S BODY two hundred broken boned bagged by bruises.
text: Larkin pulls something out of Erlich's shattered fist.
dialog: It's...
dialog: "THE LIST" Dutton and Erlich crossed off. Larkin and Toomey
dialog: yet to go, but the first letters of their names are all
text: contained in a VERTICAL OVAL, "DELT" circled in red.
dialog: LARKIN, AS TOOMEY JOINS HIM They give each other an oh-

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Daisy. How did you know?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I told you, I knew your sister.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You killed that cop Dutton.
speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ERIN

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Not me. Dirty cops killed her.
dialog: Dutton, Erlich...
text: Alex tries to handle her flailing arms but she's too manic.
text: He's getting hit in the face, the chest, and it's hurting.
text: He grabs her roughly, gets her to stop.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been shot, and stabbed and

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: My dad was right! He said you'd

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No! Why are you haunting me?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Because you need to understand.

speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. Your father wasn't right.
dialog: She turns back and...

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)

dialog: open on the desktop.
dialog: EMPTY. She checks...
text: A SMALL PAPER SHREDDER under the desk. Judging from the

text: ERIN scoops up the shreds of paper. No way to reassemble
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: (trying to be casual)
dialog: What are you doing there?
text: Erin's a terrible liar, spooked as he approaches.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I think I dropped an earring.
speaker_heading: RANDALL
dialog: Looks like you have them both on.

speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)

dialog: them.

speaker_heading: LARKIN

speaker_heading: LARKIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You see that? My name's next on

speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: LARKIN
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: Take your time. Think before you

text: KA-CHUNK. Toomey cycles his 9mm. Everything dead silent.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: He said the whole trial was a setup.

scene_heading: EXT. TENEMENT - ALLEY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: WALSH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: WALSH

text: Walsh sits down. Disturbed.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Lauren's father's involved. He

dialog: called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren
dialog: found out.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: What do they do that they had to

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I was hoping you'd find out.
speaker_heading: WALSH

speaker_heading: WALSH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WALSH (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the deal with this bird.
dialog: It's been hanging around. Alex?
text: He turns toward Alex, who's gone. A double take as Walsh

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Yeah, I know.

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: When Lauren was missing the police

dialog: (breaking down)
dialog: But I know now they had her, and
dialog: the reason they brought her here
dialog: and knew the could blame it on
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: ... is that I sent them here. I

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX'S VOICE
dialog: Four large men. And still...

speaker_heading: ALEX'S VOICE
dialog: She turned and faced them and went

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)

dialog: Places like that, they're about
dialog: unreported cash, processing money
dialog: from drugs, prostitution.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I took a chance, called asking for
dialog: Larkin and Toomey, the two other
dialog: cops. Whoever answered said "they're

speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Alex!
text: Walsh opens the door and Erin enters, wild and blood
text: smeared, remnants of the Crow mask around her eyes.
speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: They killed my dad.
dialog: It all catches up with her now, the flight, the exhaustion.
text: She throws herself into his arms.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: It's ok, it's ok...
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: It's not. I can't take it.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Erin. Who?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I don't know. I found him lying

text: Alex immobilized by this. He turns to Walsh.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Where is it? This place?
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: I think we should get some support?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What? Call the police?
speaker_heading: ERIN

dialog: Watch out for each other.
text: He heads off and we PRE-LAP sexbomb death metal POUNDING...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT
dialog: More debauched than our previous visit. Darker, more
dialog: crowded.
dialog: Patrons propositioned in front of our eyes by girls barely
text: eighteen. The room writhing.
dialog: ON THE MAINSTAGE the "Cop" strippers we saw before, but
dialog: dangerous seeming, as they pantomime an interrogation, a
dialog: handcuffed "perp" manhandled between them.
text: AT THE ENTRANCE Alex blows past people waiting to get in,
text: creating enough disturbance that TWO BOUNCERS greet him.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Toomey and Larkin. They're expecting
dialog: me.
text: The Two Bouncers give each other a look. One points to a
dialog: SIGN on the wall: "You must be 21..."
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: I need to see some I.D., pal. Circus
dialog: in town?
text: The Other Bouncer grabs Alex as he pushes past. Alex heaves
text: him into the line of WAITING PATRONS.
dialog: As they go down like dominoes... the First Bouncer pulls a
dialog: GUN.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't think you want to do that.
dialog: Lot of innocent people here...
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: A lot of people, anyway.
text: As Alex starts off... BAM! He's blown back by a shot half
text: lost in the noisy club. No panic yet.
dialog: ONSTAGE the strippers break character, looking. The audience
dialog: turns as...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 63.
text: NEAR THE ENTRANCE The First Bouncer goes flying above the
text: heads of the crowd, getting off a dramatic SHOT while
dialog: airborne, inducing...
dialog: PANDEMONIUM Patrons stampeding as BAM BAM! Alex taking
text: bullets, the miracle lost in the chaotic exit. The Bouncers
dialog: out of sight underfoot.
text: ON ALEX visible again, back on his feet. Buffeted,

dialog: flood stage...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: We'll be safe in my car. Nobody
dialog: will recognize it. Let's move yours
dialog: in back, no, down the block. Hope
dialog: it's nothing fancy. There's a chop
dialog: shop around the corner.
text: She's looking elsewhere, at the door that has quietly
text: opened. The Captain stands there. Somber reptile. Holding
text: a sheaf of papers in one hand.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You followed me here.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: No... Erin, I put out a bulletin
dialog: on your car because... there's bad
dialog: news. And I thought you should
dialog: hear it from me.
text: She stares at him expressionless.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Your father got involved with some

dialog: responsibility.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: He killed himself.
dialog: She talks with great difficulty.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: How did he kill himself?
dialog: She nods.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: With a gun. Is that what you mean?
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No. I mean... how did he kill
dialog: himself How do you figure he killed
dialog: himself--with a gun, right--when
dialog: it wasn't anywhere near where you
dialog: found him?
text: He takes a step toward her. She pulls out the Blood Pistol.
dialog: Seems crazy enough to use it.
speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You killed him.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: Erin. Don't.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Back the fuck off! Now!
text: The Captain stops, gently tosses the sheaf of papers toward
dialog: her, onto Walsh's desk.
dialog: The papers Nathan was preparing. Walsh looks at them
dialog: while...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: He left this. Names, addresses, a
dialog: note to you. These people he was
dialog: involved with killed Lauren. He
dialog: couldn't bear it anymore.
speaker_heading: WALSH
dialog: My God. He's right, it's all here.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: The note. Show it to me.
text: Erin has one eye on the papers now, recognizes her dad's
dialog: hand. The Captain inches forward.
speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Captain)
dialog: Not you!
dialog: (to Walsh)
dialog: Show it to me.
text: The Captain steps forward, right to the desk. Erin backed
dialog: into a corner now.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: It's right there, under that paper.
dialog: (grabs a note)
dialog: Here. Look.
text: She holds a hand out for the note, taking her eye off the
dialog: situation for one second as she reads...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 65.
dialog: THE NOTE A bunch of numbers added together in her father's
dialog: hand. Not a suicide note.
text: THE CAPTAIN grabs Erin's wrist and BAM!
text: A chunk of the ceiling falls as the weapon discharges. The
text: Captain throws her in a chokehold, her finger still on the
dialog: trigger.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You were always the stupid one.
text: She fights as the Captain wraps his own hand over hers,
text: wrestles her arm toward Walsh, in the sights now. BAM!
text: WALSH blown backward, collapsing by the Chess Board. Trying
text: to pull himself up. Erin struggling. As...
text: MADDEN enters from the hall, in a hurry, gun drawn.
speaker_heading: MADDEN
dialog: You need help?
text: He nods toward Walsh, who is moving, barely.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Hurry. We don't have much time.
text: BAM. A shot from Madden drops Walsh for god. As Madden
text: drags Walsh toward the door, the Captain grabs...
text: THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN pulled off the lid of the
text: Chess box, one of the pieces of tape left behind. The
dialog: Captain exits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

dialog: out, leaving human detritus, a handful of casualties from
dialog: the stampede.
text: WITH ALEX as he steps over the Two Bouncers, expired on
dialog: the floor.
text: A soft WHIMPERING marks the silence. The girl cuffed
text: onstage. Alex goes up to the terrified girl.
text: Close up, she looks way underage. He gathers her clothes,
text: spots a key on the floor.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: How old are you?
text: She listens as he unlocks the cuffs.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)

dialog: 66.
text: He watches as she hightails it out the front door, still
text: half naked. As she leaves...
text: THE CROW appears in the doorway near the broken bodies.
text: Alex takes a deep breath, as if it hurts.
text: The casualties. CAW. The Crow flies on, disappearing into
text: the back rooms. Alex turns, follows...
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: Alex moves past the empty makeup table. A lipstick cigarette
text: smolders in an ashtray. People left in a hurry. MUSIC LOUD,
dialog: as if inside our heads now. Alex continues...
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY
dialog: Nobody home. Empty images refreshed every six seconds.
dialog: Number of hits static now. Alex drawn now by the "No

text: ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN looking over her shoulder,

dialog: Lauren? You were here?
dialog: Lauren makes her stealthy way into....
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

text: ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN down the hall, peering inside
text: the partially open Back Room door, then turning back
text: startled TOWARD CAMERA as if suddenly overtaken.
text: AT THE DOOR Alex turns back, like Lauren, looks behind
text: him. The hallway is empty. He enters...
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT
text: Darkness. As Alex gropes for a lightswitch, a LIGHTER
text: FLARES. Toomey and Larkin lean in, light up in synch.
text: Alex takes in the dark fringes, dim reflections off lots
dialog: of eyes. Not taxidermy specimens.
speaker_heading: BAM BAM BAM BAM.
text: A dozen police officers lining the walls empty cartridges
text: into Alex in an angry, STROBING fusillade. In the silence
dialog: that follows...
speaker_heading: LARKIN
dialog: (after the fact)
dialog: Don't move.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 67.
text: The gang LAUGHS. Larkin makes his way to a light switch by
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: LARKIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Drinks are on me.
text: Larkin flips on the low-watt BARE BULBS hanging down past
text: industrial pipes and conduit, casting a dim light on the
dialog: cinderblock space.
speaker_heading: NO ALEX.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Cheers.
text: They look up and... BAM! Alex DROPS LARKIN with a shot to
dialog: the forehead. BAM!
text: He MISSES TOOMEY as bullets from below EXPLODE all around
text: him. Alex scampers across framing as...
text: The BARE BULBS burst, all but one, plunging us back in to
text: near darkness as Alex drops to the ground near Larkin's
text: fallen body. Jacks up the sleeve. No scar. Alex spots
dialog: Toomey, rolls out as...
dialog: THREE COPS pump rounds into Alex. BAM!
dialog: Alex takes the middle Cop out, a TOONEY-LIKE GUY who falls
text: onto Toomey, behind him. ALEX turns, forced to defend
text: himself as FULL AUTO FIRE breaks open, the other flank,
dialog: more advancing cops. While...
text: TOOMEY crawls out from under the fallen copy, then backs
dialog: out the door on hands and knees while...
text: A FINAL EXPLOSIVE FUSILLADE leaves only Alex standing. As
dialog: the echoes dissolve...
dialog: Alex Alex moves to where Toomey was, bends down to check
dialog: the body...
dialog: THE NAMEPLATE - "TOOMEY" But the pin isn't fastened
dialog: properly.
text: The badge askew. RESUME - ALEX rolls the body over, finds
text: another nameplate underneath. "Hauser." Heads off in search
dialog: of...
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Toomey!
scene_heading: INT - "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT
dialog: Toomey is clearing the "No Admittance" curtain when...
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You dripped something!
text: Toomey panics as he approaches...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 68.
text: INTERNET FANTASY SETS Monitors still updating every six
text: seconds. Toomey hears Alex coming, slips through the
dialog: "Dungeon."
dialog: BEHIND THE SHOWER FANTASY SET Toomey takes refuge out of
text: sight, next to a GAS HOT WATER HEATER, quiet as a mouse.
dialog: ALEX tears the "No Admittance" curtain completely off its
text: rod, arriving at the fantasy sets just in time to see...
text: THE DUNGEON MONITOR Toomey (frozen) scurrying through.
text: Gone now as the monitor updates. Then Alex appears,
dialog: following him through the set...
text: WITH ALEX moving to the rear of the "dungeon," on Toomey's
text: heels. WAM. Toomey hits him full force with A PIPE, sending
text: Alex sprawling backward, COLLAPSING the flimsy Shower set.
text: WAM. Toomey swings again, misses Alex, but connects with...
text: THE GAS LINE to the water heater ripped out by the blow.
text: HISS. The sound of gas, loud, as the line breaks.
text: RESUME Alex straddles Toomey, just as Toomey manages to
text: get his gun pointed in Alex's face. Hissing gas nearby.
text: CLICK. Toomey cocks the gun.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Spark, gas... bad combination. And
dialog: it's not this leak here, that's
dialog: the least of your worries.
dialog: WAM! Alex swings Toomey's pipe HARD at a much bigger GAS
text: LINE right behind the gas heater, leaving it badly cracked.
dialog: The hiss magnified 100% nos.
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going to play a little game
dialog: called "Who's got the Scar."
speaker_heading: TOOMEY
dialog: What Scar? What fucking scar?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: (buzzer sound)
dialog: AAAANK. That's not how we play the
dialog: game.
dialog: Alex jacks Toomey's sleeve down. No Scar. Alex pissed as
text: Toomey locks eyes with him. Really seeing him now.
speaker_heading: TOOMEY
dialog: You're him! You're Corvis! We fried
dialog: your ass. You're dead, man!
speaker_heading: ALEX

scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT
text: Some light filters in as a door opens to the outside. A
text: FIGURE enters, squats among the bodies. He leans in, closes
dialog: larkin's eyes, and we see...
text: It's Madden. Blood on his hands. He hears Alex's VOICE
text: faintly, then Toomey cries out in pain. Madden moves
dialog: toward...
scene_heading: INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT
text: Madden creeps down the hallway to the back room. VOICES
dialog: growing louder.
speaker_heading: TOOMEY
dialog: Fucking Zombie.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: The scar.
speaker_heading: TOOMEY
dialog: There is no scar. I'm telling you.
text: As Madden moves toward the conversation, his face registers
dialog: the slightest of smiles.
text: MADDEN'S CREEPING POV MONITORS obliquely visible as he
text: reaches the end of the hall by the Fantasy sets. The
dialog: "Shower" monitor shows Alex and Toomey, visible through
dialog: the trashed set, updated every six seconds.
text: MADDEN SNIFFS gas. The HISS now audible along with Alex's
text: voice. Madden smiles. Pulls out his 9mm.
text: And BACKS UP, away from the Fantasy Sets toward the back
dialog: room. Madden takes aim at...
text: THE FIRST MONITOR The images is Alex threatening Toomey.
text: Updating now--LOSING ALEX on the Monitor as he steps into
dialog: frame in person, looks up and BAM!
text: CROWVISION a speeding bullet passes narrowly by and...
text: ANGLE - GROUND ZERO as the bullet hits the monitor in a
dialog: shower of sparks, followed by...
dialog: BOOM! A ROILING FIREBALL Seems to vaporize Alex before
text: flying down the hallway right at CAMERA.
text: Madden manages a couple steps in retreat before it blows
text: him into the back room with a deafening roar.
scene_heading: EXT. "THE HOLE" - INFERNO - NIGHT

speaker_heading: Distant SIRENS draw closer.
text: A SLOW SCAN, someone's OBSTRUCTED POV of Hell.
text: INCLUDE ALEX watching from under a collapsed cinderblock
dialog: wall that offers some protection from the flames, if not

text: THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION sticking out of the
text: rubble, murky through the flames, growing clearer as camera
text: PUSHES, flames licking at it...
text: ALEX tries to move toward the arm. Forced back by too-
text: intense flame as another beam falls, the rubble shifts
dialog: and...
text: THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION skeletal now, baked
text: down to bones. A dozen short metal rods on the ground under
text: it. He picks a few up. THE CAPTAIN drawn now to...
dialog: UNDER THE RUBBLE - WHERE ALEX WAS water dripping off the
dialog: concrete, collecting in the place where Alex hid. But he's
text: long gone. The Captain drops the rods. Satisfied it's over.

dialog: glass from his flesh. Painful.
dialog: Alex registers that the rules have changed. He finds a
dialog: necktie of Walsh's, uses it to bind the wound, staunch the
text: flow. He scans the room again looking for...
dialog: Something. But everything seems ok. He passes...
dialog: The Chess Box, the picture of Lauren and Alex gone. Just a

dialog: "City Leaders Vow Crackdown in Wake of Randall Murder."
dialog: PUSHING, finding among the City Leaders...
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You are like the guest who would

dialog: That's not a criticism. Just an

text: Alex draws the knife from his clothes.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't think you're going to use

speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: He's cute. Was cute.
dialog: REVEAL, this is the Secretary's POV through the window.
text: She's bent over someone's toes, painting them BLUE.
dialog: WIDE. The Mystery Room revealed. Taxidermy specimens line
dialog: the wall and the table.
text: Erin stands in PROFILE in the middle of the room, strangely
text: silent, hands tied overhead by a rope that runs to the
dialog: ceiling.
dialog: The Secretary brushing polish on Erin's toes.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (CONT'D)
dialog: But the face, well, makeup can
dialog: work for you or against you. Right?
dialog: The Secretary applies a last flourish of polish, then
text: stands, kisses Erin gently.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (CONT'D)
dialog: All done. Very nice.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You're a good listener.
dialog: The Secretary moves off REVEALING...
text: ERIN'S FACE MOUTH SEWN shut in a rough zigzag stitch, like
dialog: the scar. Her eyes dart as...
text: THE DOOR opens. The Captain and Madden carry Alex in. Madden
text: sweeps the TAXIDERMY SPECIMENS back with his hand, clearing
dialog: a space for Alex on the table. Among them...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 77.
dialog: THE CROW on its Corvus Brachyrhynchos stand takes a small
dialog: hop backward, this sign of life unnoticed as...
text: RESUME WHUMP. Alex heaved onto the table.
speaker_heading: MADDEN
dialog: So was he dead? Or alive?
text: The Secretary puts her ear to Alex's lifeless lips.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: I've seen birds stuffed and mounted
dialog: so lifelike you'd swear you saw
dialog: them breathing.
text: This reminds him... he looks at the Crow on the stand.
dialog: Lifeless, stuffed. As it should be.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe we had a case of that here.
dialog: (to Secretary)
dialog: Get me my kit.
speaker_heading: MADDEN
dialog: You two are majorly demented. Anyone
dialog: ever tell you that?
text: The Secretary steps off to grab thekit, leaving Alex's

dialog: eyeballs first before...
text: ANGLE - ERIN looking up at her own hands, bound above her
dialog: as she eases them apart and...
text: The HEART SHAPED LOCKET slips from between her palms and
text: she closes them again in time to catch the chain, the locket
dialog: swinging.
text: ON THE TABLE X-CLOSE. The locket reflected in Alex's
dialog: lifeless open eyes a second before...
text: The Secretary returns, blocking the sightline. Lays out
dialog: the Kit, nasty looking tools left over from the Inquisition.
text: Then unbuttons Alex's tattered shirt, undressing him for
dialog: the procedure.
dialog: Stab wounds everywhere.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Fifty three?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: In all the excitement I kind of
dialog: lost count.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I think I'll mount him with his

dialog: from Erin's praying hands.
scene_heading: FLASH! ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV HIGH ANGLE CROWVISION.

dialog: Two figures--Alex and Erin--kneeling. RESUME - THE LOCKET
dialog: released from the Crow's beak, passing through the TRIO'S
text: HANDS uncaught, bouncing off Alex onto the table, in front
dialog: of his open eyes.
scene_heading: ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV FLASH. AT GROUND LEVEL. Alex
text: fastens the LOCKET around her neck. The distortion
dialog: lessening, becoming Alex's POV.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: ... it connects you to me...
speaker_heading: FLASH.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: No matter what happens... you're
dialog: innocent... I promise...
dialog: FLASH. Alex painting her face.
text: RESUME Alex BLINKS. The Captain reacts--oh shit--starts to
text: bring the knife down, a hurried strike at Alex's chest.
text: WAM! Alex grabs the Captain's arm in his hand, stopping
dialog: the movement on a dime.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: All lies. Everything you ever showed
dialog: me.
text: MADDEN pulls a gun, points it at Erin. ALEX jumps up, flying
text: INTO the gun as it goes off.
dialog: CRASH! They tumble THROUGH THE WINDOW into the Captain's
dialog: office while...
text: THE CAPTAIN cuts down the rope holding Erin. She
dialog: collapses...
text: ON THE TABLE strewn with blades, secreting one between her
dialog: hands, in the second before...
text: THE CAPTAIN drags Erin off. The Secretary flails at the
dialog: Crow with a metal ROD, while...
text: IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden has the gun on Alex now.
dialog: BAM! No effect. BAM!
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 79.
text: Madden sweating it now, continuing to shoot with no effect
dialog: as...
dialog: THE MYSTERY ROOM The Secretary finally connects with the
dialog: Crow, batting it against the wall, noticing this coincides
dialog: with...
text: Alex goes flying against the desk, winged himself. Madden
dialog: c Onfused, not understanding.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY (O.S.)
dialog: It's the bird! Kill it!
text: Madden wheels, points the gun through the busted-out picture
dialog: window into...
text: The SECRETARY dives for cover as bullets explode around

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: You brought him back. Good. He

dialog: Seen but not heard. They ought to

dialog: Erin winces, looks down...
text: THE BLADE emerging from her sleeve as she tries to hold it
text: with her two bound hands. DING. The elevator jerks to a
dialog: stop.
text: THE CAPTAIN grabs her off the floor and she RAMS the blade
text: into his abdomen with the force of the entire body. Twists
text: it. The elevator doors open.
text: ERIN pulls out the blade, claws her way out the door, the
text: Captain hanging on to her, finally getting free as she
text: swipes at him again, drawing fresh blood. Running now,
dialog: into...
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Erin stumbles between cars in the dark underground garage,
dialog: cutting the cord off her hands, leaving it behind as...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 80.
text: Behind her, the Captain unsteady on his feet, a wounded
text: animal. He pulls out a GLOCK 9MM and KA-CHUNK. Cycles it.
text: Erin dives between cars, scrambling on hands and knees.
dialog: Looks around.
text: HER POV - SCANNING a small garage with a few police cruisers
text: by a SERVICE AREA and no people. A barred GATE over the
dialog: exit. No way out.
text: ERIN winces. Then stifles a cry as she cuts the stitches
text: off her mouth with the knife. Drops the threads on the
dialog: floor and moves off...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Alex runs past the glass AWARDS CASE, takes a flying leap
text: behind the desk, seeking cover as Madden empties a clip at

text: advances on Alex, hidden behind the shredded desk as...
text: THE SECRETARY clears stuffed birds off the table trying to
text: expose the wounded crow cowering back against the wall.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Here pretty bird. Here birdy.
text: WHOP! She grabs it, the Crow flapping desperately as...
text: IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden creeps up on the desk, peers
dialog: over it. Nothing. Out of nowhere...
text: WAM! Alex rushes Madden, bulldozing him across the room
text: with a pained cry of brute force toward...
text: THE AWARDS CASE CRASH! Glass shatters as Alex hurls Madden,
text: who swivels around in time to get off a last shot BAM!
dialog: That collapses Alex to the floor.
text: IN THE MYSTERY ROOM The Crow squeezes out of the Secretary's
text: grasp, leaving her holding a couple feathers.
text: AT THE AWARD'S CASE Alex hauls himself off the floor as
dialog: the Crow joins him. Seeing...
text: MADDEN'S HEAD has taken its place among glass bowls and
text: trophies, half decapitated by the glass shelf it now rests

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Where'd they go?
text: Alex eases the Secretary to her feet with a hand around
text: her neck, her back to the wall. She looks UP, smiling at...
text: WALSH - RIGHT ARM MISSING hangs high overhead from some
text: kind of hook. His arm has been crudely removed.
text: Underneath him, on the table, a BOX of 2" surgical stainless
text: steel rods sits by a pool of blood. ALEX yells, reeling,
dialog: as...
text: The door flies open. A half dozen cops in, all targeting
dialog: Alex as...
text: THE SECRETARY plunges the Lauren KNIFE in Alex's back. He
text: spins violently THROWING her HARD against the wall. WAM!
text: Surprise!-she sticks. REVEAL, she's impaled on ANTELOPE
text: ANTLERS, hanging off the wall. Her head drops, looking
text: down as a stream of blood flows down her legs, drips off
dialog: her toes...
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (dying words)
dialog: My nails.
text: BAM BAM BAM. The new arrivals open fire. Alex reaches over

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE

speaker_heading: INCLUDE ERIN
speaker_heading: SECRETARY

text: ERIN Listening, neurons firing. Cranes her neck to see.
text: Nothing. WIDER the Captain appears BEHIND ERIN, over the
text: stacks of tires. She's oblivious, then...
text: Erin wheels, slashes across his wrist. The Glock falls,
text: Erin grabs it, levels it at the Captain. Her finger tense
dialog: on the trigger.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: (re: gun)
dialog: I know you too well. You won't do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: You don't know me at all.
text: BAM! She pulls the trigger, simultaneously wrenching the
dialog: gun, aiming just enough off that...
text: THE CAPTAIN yells in pain, rushes his hand to his ear, a

dialog: pulls...
text: THE TRIGGER again, again, again. No click, no blast.
dialog: NOTHING.

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 84.
text: PUNCH IN... CLOSE. The Figure, Alex, strikes downward,
dialog: right THROUGH the glass moonroof.

text: yanks his own right off the wheel and up, through the
dialog: moonroof...
text: ON THE ROOF OF THE SEDAN Alex kneels now, holding the

speaker_heading: ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: If it is... ba-boom, ba-boom...

text: SLOW FADE IN as our eyes adjust to the dim light.
speaker_heading: ALEX'S VOICE (CONT'D)

dialog: We're in the death chamber. Dark. Claustrophobic.
text: The only light a few panel indicators and spill from the

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't expect a call from the
dialog: Governor. Any last words? Captain,
dialog: my Captain?
dialog: REVEAL the Captain in the chair. A private execution. Erin
text: slumped along a side wall. Totally inscrutable. Intense.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Yeah. Fuck you.
dialog: A long beat of silence.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Was that it? Well, ok.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: I'm not dying for your goddamn
dialog: illusions. You got that? You think
dialog: you and your girlfriend had some
dialog: rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit.
dialog: She was already bored, why do you
dialog: think she was looking around? You're

text: starts to move off. Then stops, near Alex, looking with
dialog: him at...
text: THEIR POV - THE ZIGZAG SCAR fibrillating, as we PUSH into
dialog: seething detail.

speaker_heading: ERIN (CONT'D)
dialog: In the woods you said you had
dialog: nothing. But you wouldn't, and I
dialog: wouldn't if there's some way you

dialog: not right away.
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Erin. I'll always be with you.
dialog: For a split second, she's...
text: LAUREN Smiling. Sublime. She kisses him. As the break off,
dialog: it's...
text: ERIN AGAIN She hangs on a long moment before letting go.
dialog: Then she spots something...
text: ON THE GROUND - A SIGN carried by one of the protestors.
dialog: "Remember the Victim." With a picture of Lauren. Someone
dialog: has written a bold "s" after it. "Remember the Victims."
text: ERIN picks up the sign.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Alex. Look at this.
text: She turns to Alex. But he's gone. She tries to keep it
dialog: together as...
text: CAMERA BOOMS up leaving her alone outside the prison walls,
dialog: with her memories, and her conscience, and her hopes, which
dialog: is alot.
text: As a DUSTDEVIL whips up in the parking lot, she drops the
dialog: sign, and starts to CRY.
speaker_heading: ERIN'S VOICE
dialog: In that moment when Alex went...
dialog: wherever he went... when he made
dialog: that choice, I knew I was making a
dialog: choice too. To be alive. In the
dialog: world. And it made me cry.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DAWN

dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: ERIN'S VOICE
dialog: Maybe the world is a bad place but
dialog: the Captain gone has to be some
dialog: improvement. And that hope, that
dialog: tomorrow will be better, is enough
dialog: to keep me going.
text: The Crow flaps off, REVEALING the WHITE KING, laid by

dialog: The Crow, on the stand marked Corvis Brachyrhynchos, stuffed
dialog: and mute.
text: Its eyes blink a last time, then are motionless.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETARY - LAUREN AND ALEX'S GRAVES
text: X-CLOSE. JOURNAL. A not-too-loopy feminine hand, writing
dialog: the words we are hearing.
speaker_heading: ERIN'S VOICE
dialog: When I think of Lauren fighting
dialog: and dying, it tears me apart, but
dialog: it also reassures me. That Lauren
dialog: and Alex were meant for each other.
dialog: REVEAL... Erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically
dialog: transformed wild child.
dialog: A shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes
dialog: that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.
speaker_heading: ERIN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: That they're together now. Fighters.
dialog: United by love. And anger. That
dialog: they've given also to me.
text: She's leaning up against a new headstone.
dialog: "Alex Corvis 1981-1999 Always With Us."
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: I love Alex. As my sister always
dialog: hoped I would. And I love Lauren.
dialog: And I know, because of this, that
dialog: love does not die. I'm alive.
dialog: Thinking of them. Hoping that,
dialog: sometimes, they're thinking of me.
text: Erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands. She takes
text: the Locket off her neck, drapes it over Alex's headstone,
dialog: like the one already over Lauren's.
text: She stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger
text: to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones. And leaves.
