speaker_heading: MARCH 12 2008
speaker_heading: SPACE.
text: 
text: But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is
text: a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.
text: 
text: Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON
text: STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...
dialog: planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?
text: 
text: Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden
text: inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of
text: existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.
text: 
text: The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,
text: spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it
text: contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.
text: 
text: The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into
text: the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,
text: racing back out from the black hole.
text: 
text: Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-
text: like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --
text: a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet
text: with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.
text: 
text: The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
text: our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North
dialog: America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and
text: through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.
text: 
text: The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum
text: chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected
text: in a heavy piece of glass.
text: 
text: The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in
text: the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a
text: concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.
text: 
text: An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it
text: parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end
text: of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY
text: 
text: The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission
text: Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend
text: and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the
text: displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by
text: a series of echoes.
text: 
text: The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee.
text: 
text: CUT TO:
dialog: 2.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LIGO OFFICES, CALTECH, PASADENA -- DAY
text: 
dialog: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
text: headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. POSTDOCS
text: and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing.
text: 
text: ANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy.
text: A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LIGO DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, CALTECH -- DAY
text: 
text: Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large, sunlit office,
text: which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech's campus.
text: 
text: His ASSISTANT, 30s, is on the phone, on hold. He looks up
text: at Ansen as he enters.
text: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: I'm on hold with the INS.
dialog: (COVERS MICROPHONE)
dialog: Don't you think we should double
dialog: check the triangulation before we
speaker_heading: CALL ANYBODY-
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: We have double checked it.
text: 
text: Someone finally picks up the line.
text: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Yes. I'm trying to reach-
dialog: (pause, listens)
dialog: No, I don't think you understand how
dialog: serious this is.
dialog: (PAUSE)
dialog: Because if you did, we'd be having
dialog: this conversation in person.
text: 
text: He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: What did they say?
text: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: They said we should look out the
text: window.
text: 
text: Ansen steps to the window and looks out:
text: 
text: In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of
text: the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of
text: the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his
dialog: building.
dialog: 3.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH -- DAY
text: 
text: Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table.
text: 
text: The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
text: some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. Armed
text: guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: Is that really necessary?
text: 
text: One of the NSA agents leans forward.
text: 
speaker_heading: NSA AGENT
dialog: You've been complaining for years
dialog: that the government doesn't take
dialog: your project seriously enough, Doctor.
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: You can't have it both ways.
text: 
text: Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector.
text: On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: Yesterday morning, our facility in
dialog: Hanford identified this signal: a
dialog: neutron star colliding with a
dialog: supermassive black hole. We went
dialog: through the last year's data and
dialog: triangulated the source.
text: 
text: The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron
text: star circling into the black hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: NSA AGENT
dialog: We know that, Doctor. What we don't
dialog: know is why, according to your
dialog: numbers, this event took place right
dialog: here in our own solar system.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the
dialog: rest of our solar system around the black hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: It didn't. Because if it had we'd
dialog: all be dead by now.
text: 
text: On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are
text: consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled
text: into orbit around its new master.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Which leaves only one explanation:
dialog: The signal traveled through a
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: 4.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN (CONT'D)
text: wormhole. A gateway to a distant
dialog: corner of the universe. The black
text: hole is on the far side.
text: 
text: On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant
text: corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A
text: gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel.
text: 
speaker_heading: NSA AGENT
dialog: I've read your book, Doctor. You
dialog: said that wormholes are impossible.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: There is nothing quite as satisfying
dialog: as being proved utterly wrong.
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: I said that a wormhole couldn't exist
dialog: naturally. Not for more than a few
dialog: billionths of a second. It would
dialog: have to be... stabilized.
text: 
speaker_heading: NSA AGENT
dialog: Stabilized by what?
text: 
text: Ansen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps in to his defense.
text: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: We don't have any way to answer that
dialog: question.
text: 
speaker_heading: NSA AGENT
dialog: (IGNORES HIM)
dialog: You're not under peer review here,
dialog: Doctor. I don't care about your
dialog: reputation. I need to know how that
dialog: thing got there. Now.
text: 
text: Ansen finally speaks up.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: If you're worried about an invasion,
dialog: I would start drafting the articles
dialog: of surrender.
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: Whoever they are, if they can build
dialog: a wormhole, they could erase us in
text: the blink of an eye. Luckily, that
dialog: also means we have nothing they could
dialog: be interested in.
text: 
speaker_heading: NSA AGENT
dialog: Then why is it there?
dialog: 5.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: I don't know. Maybe it's an
dialog: invitation. A chance to commune
dialog: with an advanced species.
text: 
text: The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. The agent notices.
text: 
speaker_heading: NSA AGENT
dialog: You don't agree?
text: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: (DELICATE)
dialog: No. I don't think we can assume an
dialog: alien intelligence built the wormhole.
dialog: (CHANGES TACK)
dialog: But the opportunity it represents is
dialog: incredible. We could explore parts
dialog: of the universe we never dreamt of
dialog: reaching in our lifetimes.
text: 
text: The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues, who
text: steps out of the room.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: We need to get back to work. I have
dialog: a conference call with our European
dialog: partners in fifteen minutes.
text: 
speaker_heading: NSA AGENT
dialog: We severed the connections to your
dialog: European partners this morning.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: (INDIGNANT)
dialog: You can't do that. The Europeans
dialog: put up some of the funding...
text: 
speaker_heading: GOVERNMENT MAN
dialog: We'll send them a check.
dialog: (STANDS)
dialog: Your project is now classified under
dialog: the State Secrets Act.
text: 
text: He steps out the door, leaving the men alone. The assistant,
text: outraged, turns back to his boss.
text: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: They can't keep this a secret. You
dialog: know that. Sooner or later...
text: 
text: The younger man looks down, embarrassed, as he notices that
text: tears are rolling down the older man's cheeks.
dialog: 6.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN
dialog: I don't care about that. I've spent
dialog: my whole life being afraid we would
dialog: wipe ourselves out before this moment
dialog: arrived. We've made so many mistakes,
dialog: I wasn't sure we'd make it...
text: 
text: The assitant realizes that the old man is weeping for joy.
dialog: Relief.
text: 
speaker_heading: ANSEN (CONT'D)
dialog: But this will change everything.
dialog: Fifty years from now, nothing will
dialog: be the same.

text: The older man looks at the simulation on the screen of the
dialog: tiny link between our galaxy and another.

text: SUPER TITLE: "FIFTY YEARS LATER"
text: 
text: A large old diesel tour bus is parked by the side of a dirt
text: road, smoke pouring out of its open hood. A dozen MEN in
text: BASEBALL UNIFORMS are standing around the front of the bus.
text: 
text: A battered PICKUP pulls up, and a MAN, 30s, gets out, leaving
text: his two SONS in the car. This is COOPER. He joins the
text: ballplayers staring at the lifeless diesel engine.
text: 
speaker_heading: BALLPLAYER
dialog: Seized up on us.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Long way to come by bus. I thought
dialog: you guys would have a plane.
text: 
speaker_heading: BALLPLAYER
dialog: We did. Ran out of parts for it.
dialog: You know anything about diesels?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: A little.
text: 
text: Cooper steps to the engine compartment.
text: 
text: The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH,
text: 10, watching them. He wanders over.
dialog: 7.
text: 
speaker_heading: BALLPLAYER
dialog: You think your dad's going to be
dialog: able to help us out?
text: 
text: Murph, a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye, smiles at the
dialog: ballplayer.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: My dad can fix anything.
dialog: (WRY SMILE)
dialog: Except maybe your fastball.
text: 
text: The ballplayer frowns: smartass kid.
text: 
text: After a moment under the hood, Cooper signals to the driver,
text: who tries the engine. It turns over once, then STARTS.
text: 
speaker_heading: BALLPLAYER
dialog: Sure appreciate the help.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (SHRUGS)
dialog: You don't make it, my boys won't get
dialog: to see you lose.
text: 
text: The ballplayers load up into the bus and as it pulls away,
text: we can see the logo painted across the back of the bus for
dialog: the first time:

scene_heading: EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT
text: 
text: Earth spins, lazily. From this height, it looks much the
dialog: same as it has done for thousands of years.
text: 
text: Suddenly, a tiny black object appears, racing toward Earth.
text: 
text: The object SMASHES into a large satellite and races onward.
text: Behind it, the satellite spins out of orbit in a cloud of
dialog: fragments.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT
text: 
text: An old minor league stadium. The stands are barely halfway
text: full. Cooper, his boys, and Cooper's father-in-law, DONALD,
text: 60s, have a row to themselves behind the dugout.
text: 
text: Murph offers his grandpa some popcorn.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
dialog: I want a hot dog.
dialog: 8.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: (CONFUSED)
dialog: What's a hot dog?
text: 
text: Suddenly, play stops on the field below as the players and
text: fans look up at the night sky:
text: 
text: A bright blue streak is tearing across it. It's beautiful.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Is that a comet, Dad?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Satellite. Big one. Probably
dialog: Chinese.
text: 
text: Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in
dialog: the upper atmosphere.
text: 
text: After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but
dialog: everyone has seen it plenty of times before.
text: 
text: Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop
text: fly and the Yankees load the bases. Donald looks disgusted.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. COOPER'S TRUCK -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper guides his truck along a potholed road. His father-
text: in-law is riding shotgun; the boys are sleeping in the back.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: Those clowns would get their asses
dialog: handed to them by the ballplayers I
dialog: grew up watching.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You ruin it for the boys when you
dialog: talk like that.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: I'm not doing my grandkids any favors
dialog: by lying to them. They're growing
dialog: up watching lousy baseball.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: They didn't have any baseball at all
dialog: when I was a kid.
text: 
text: That shuts the old man up for now. They drive on in silence.
text: 
text: CUT TO:
dialog: 9.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING
text: 
text: The sun is gently landing on the horizon, painting the sea
text: of corn around Cooper's modest house gold. Cooper walks out
text: of his house, still eating his breakfast.
text: 
text: Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke
text: in the distance. The neighboring fields are BURNING.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: Nelson's burning up his crops. Found
text: some of the blight on the okra.
text: 
text: Cooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting
dialog: fire to the crop.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I thought okra wasn't susceptible.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Better safe than sorry.
dialog: (looks at him)
dialog: You've got to take the boys to school.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Something wrong with your truck?
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: Parent-teacher conference day.
text: 
text: Cooper bends his head in dismay.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Be nice to Murph's teacher. She's
dialog: single, you know.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What does that have to do with
dialog: anything?
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: We're supposed to be repopulating
dialog: the earth. Gotta pull your weight.
dialog: Besides, the boys could do with a
dialog: woman in their lives.
text: 
text: The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper
text: pulls away before Donald can continue.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper weaves the car along a dirt road. The kids are arguing
text: over an ancient comic book in the back seat.
dialog: 10.
text: 
text: Cooper turns around to break it up.
text: 
text: BANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper examines the flattened tire. Looks at his older son.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Get the spare, Tom.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: That is the spare.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: All right. We'll use the patch kit.
text: 
text: He moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks
dialog: very glum.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: I... I think the patch kit might not
dialog: be there...
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Because I was using it for my bike.
text: 
text: Cooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Murph's law.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: (CONFUSED)
dialog: What's that?
text: 
text: Tom snorts with laughter. Turns to his dad.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: The kid doesn't even know what he
dialog: was named after...
text: 
text: Cooper shoots Tom a look -- enough.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Murph's law means what can go wrong
dialog: will go wrong.
text: 
text: Murph, looking hurt, walks off. Cooper turns to his son.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Find something to patch it with.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: How am I supposed to do that?
dialog: 11.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Figure it out. I'm not always going
dialog: to be here to help you.
text: 
text: Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is
text: looking out over the river.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: Is that really why I'm named Murph,
dialog: dad?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't
dialog: mean that. It means what can happen
dialog: will happen. All kinds of things.
dialog: Good or bad. And that's the way you
dialog: want it to be.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: Why?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Because if nothing ever happened to
dialog: you then you wouldn't learn anything.
text: 
text: Murph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Murph?
text: 
text: Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper
text: looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles
text: his son to the ground.
text: 
text: Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they
text: can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension,
text: then soars off over the fields behind them.
text: 
text: Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a
text: laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the
text: back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Get in.
text: 
text: Tom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling
dialog: with the jack.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What about the tire?
text: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER
text: 
text: The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper
dialog: can push it on three good tires.
dialog: 12.
text: 
text: Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to
dialog: the directional antenna.
text: 
text: Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning
text: the horizon.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: OVER THERE-
text: 
text: To the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears,
text: flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the wheel--
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER -- DAY
text: 
text: The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the
text: river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development
text: in the valley below, planted over with corn.
text: 
text: Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still
text: hugging the ground. It has impossibly long, skinny wings,
text: like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The
text: tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK -- DAY
text: 
text: Murph is fiddling with the computer. His older brother takes
text: the computer from him and fires up emulation software.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: It's a Chinese military drone. Solar
dialog: cells could power an entire farm.
dialog: (TO TOM)
dialog: Take the wheel.
text: 
text: Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep it pointed right at it, OK?
text: 
text: Murph nods. Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop,
text: trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen
text: fills with Cyrillic characters.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
text: 
text: Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets
text: of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted
dialog: over with corn.
text: 
text: They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot
text: harvester. Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it.
text: 
text: BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of
dialog: the combine.
dialog: 13.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
text: 
text: Tom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart
text: a straight path across the fields. The truck BOUNCES as it
text: SMASHES through an old picket fence.
text: 
text: Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control
text: circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to
dialog: climb into the foothills of the Sierras.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
text: 
text: Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. The drone
text: soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he
text: concentrates on the laptop.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (UNSURE)
dialog: Dad?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Almost got it. Don't slow down.
text: 
text: In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone
text: plummets from view.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
speaker_heading: DAD.
text: 
text: Cooper looks up. Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of
text: the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop.
text: 
text: Tom locks up the brakes.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
text: 
text: The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop.
text: 
text: Cooper climbs out, holding the laptop. Murph climbs out
text: next to him, still pointing the Pringles can.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We lost it.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (SMILING)
dialog: No we didn't.
dialog: 14.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. Cooper types a
text: couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad.
text: The huge drone banks and turns in response.
text: 
text: As the boys watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring high over
text: them, banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the
text: valley, light glinting from the black panels on its back.
dialog: It's a beautiful sight.
text: 
text: Cooper crouches next to Murph.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to give it a whirl?
text: 
text: Murph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and
text: moves his fingers gingerly across the pad.
text: 
text: In response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in
text: the valley below.
text: 
text: For a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone
text: dancing through the valley below.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Set her down in the valley -- there,
dialog: next to the river.
text: 
text: Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins
text: guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY
text: 
text: The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct
text: golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone,
text: 
text: Cooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save
text: for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools.
text: 
text: Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: How long do you think it's been up
dialog: there, Dad?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Chinese mission control went down
dialog: same as us, twenty years ago. It's
dialog: been up there ever since.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What was it doing flying so low?
text: 
text: Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop.
dialog: 15.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: It was looking for something.
dialog: Intercepted some kind of signal.
dialog: (SHRUGS)
dialog: It's been at eighty thousand feet.
dialog: Sun probably cooked its brain.
text: 
text: Cooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access
text: patch. He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch.
text: Inside, surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a

speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: What are you going to do with it?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Reprogram it. Give it something
dialog: socially responsible to do like drive
dialog: a combine or a tractor.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: (QUIET)
dialog: Couldn't we just let it go? It's
dialog: not hurting anyone.
text: 
text: Cooper looks down at his son. Good kid.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We need all the help we can get,
dialog: Murph. This thing has to adapt,
dialog: just like the rest of us.
text: 
text: Cooper gently pries the control module out.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
text: 
text: It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in
text: front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half
text: of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an
text: efficient-looking man, shakes his hand.
text: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This
dialog: is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher.
text: 
text: Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive.
dialog: 16.
text: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
dialog: So we've gotten Tom's score back.
dialog: Congratulations. He's going to make
dialog: an excellent farmer.
text: 
text: The principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper,
text: who looks taken aback.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What about college?
text: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: The University of California only
dialog: accepts a few hundred students a
dialog: year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be
dialog: realistic.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You're ruling out college for him
dialog: now? He's only fifteen.
text: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score
dialog: simply isn't high enough.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
dialog: (BEAT)
dialog: 30-inch inseam?
text: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: I'm not sure I see--
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You're telling me you need two numbers
dialog: to measure your own ass, but just
dialog: one to measure my son's future?
text: 
text: Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the
text: principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense.
text: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: I understand you're a well-educated
dialog: man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Engineer.
text: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Frankly, the world doesn't need any
dialog: more engineers. We didn't run out
dialog: of trains or television sets or
dialog: satellites.
dialog: (BEAT)
dialog: We ran out of food.
dialog: 17.
text: 
text: Cooper leans back. He's not going to win this one.
text: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
dialog: The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper.
dialog: And I'm sure your son Tom is going
dialog: to make a fine one.
dialog: (SMILES BENIGNLY)
dialog: We're a caretaker generation. But
dialog: things are getting better. Maybe
dialog: your grandchildren will be able to
dialog: attend college.
text: 
text: Cooper looks down, swallowing his anger.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Are we done?
text: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says
dialog: that Murph brought a book to school
dialog: about the lunar landings.
text: 
text: He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the
text: cover across the desk to Cooper.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: One of my old textbooks. Murph liked
text: the pictures.
text: 
speaker_heading: MS. KELLY
dialog: This is one of the old federal
dialog: textbooks. We've replaced them with
dialog: corrected versions.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Corrected?
text: 
speaker_heading: MS. KELLY
dialog: The new textbooks explain that the
dialog: Apollo lunar missions were faked in
dialog: order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You don't believe we went to the
dialog: moon?
text: 
speaker_heading: MS. KELLY
dialog: I believe it was a brilliant piece
dialog: of propaganda. The Soviets spent
dialog: years trying to build rockets and
dialog: other useless machines.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: "Useless machines"?
dialog: 18.
text: 
text: Cooper looks to the Principal for help. None is forthcoming.
text: 
speaker_heading: MS. KELLY
dialog: Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of
dialog: wastefulness and excess that the
dialog: 20th century represented. Your
dialog: children would be better off learning
dialog: about this planet, rather than reading
dialog: fantasies about leaving it.
text: 
text: Cooper is silent for a long moment.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: One of those useless machines they
dialog: used to make was called an MRI. If
dialog: we had any of them left the doctors
dialog: might have been able to find the
dialog: cyst in my wife's brain before she
dialog: died, rather than afterwards. And
dialog: then my kids could have been raised
dialog: by two parents, instead of me and
dialog: their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.
text: 
text: Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger.
dialog: Most of it, anyway.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever consider the best thing for
dialog: the world and humanity might have
dialog: been for us to part company?
text: 
text: Cooper gets up to leave.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK, COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper climbs into the truck, trying to hold it together.
text: He PUNCHES the wheel.
text: 
text: The radio KEYS to life. He ignores it. Sits for a moment
text: in misery. Finally he picks up the handset.
text: 
speaker_heading: CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: Got a call from Riggs, down in
dialog: Galveston. Says some of the tractors
dialog: you built him went haywire last night.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Just tell him to power down the
text: controllers for a couple minutes.
text: 
speaker_heading: CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
dialog: I did. He wants you to come down in
dialog: person anyway. Says he found
dialog: something you should take a look at.
dialog: 19.
text: 
text: Cooper stares at the wheel. Shakes his head in frustration.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar. Pulls
text: a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub. Checks it over.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach.
text: The radio crackles to life.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission
dialog: to enter your airspace.
text: 
speaker_heading: AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (O.S.)
dialog: Permission granted. Welcome to the
dialog: sovereign nation of Texas.
text: 
text: Coop hangs up the radio. Banks the plane inland.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. GULF COAST -- DAY
text: 
text: Below, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying
text: to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in
text: the soft sand.
text: 
text: A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead.
text: 
text: Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.
text: 
text: He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying
text: to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.
text: 
text: Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike
text: the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault
text: code and resets the computer.
text: 
text: The man jogs over to meet him.
text: 
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em
dialog: took off last night, looking for
dialog: something.
dialog: (points to dunes)
dialog: Looks like they found it, too. I
dialog: thought you were the man to see it.
text: 
text: Riggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows.
text: 
text: Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming
text: vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping
text: at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater.
dialog: 20.
text: 
text: As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself,
text: trying to reach the crater.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down
text: into the crater.
text: 
text: At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across --
text: the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a
text: satellite. Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP.
text: 
text: Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal.
text: He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides
text: down into the hole.
text: 
text: The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. He
text: rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk.
text: 
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: (FROM ABOVE)
dialog: You think it's an alien?
text: 
text: Cooper wipes sand off of the object, revealing the faint,
text: familiar outline etched into the side of the probe:
text: 
text: The stars and stripes of the old federal government.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Not exactly.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
text: 
text: Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe
text: out of the crater and onto the beach.
text: 
text: Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Space probe. Never seen one like
dialog: it, though. Looks like it's been to
dialog: hell and back.
text: 
text: The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back.
text: 
speaker_heading: RIGGS
dialog: How do you think it wound up here?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites
dialog: would have been shot down by the
dialog: Chinese twenty years ago.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form.
dialog: 21.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat
text: of chowder. He turns to watch Cooper work, amused.
text: 
text: The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table. Cooper
text: works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH. Cooper gives
text: up -- the torch hasn't made a scratch. The probe CHIRPS.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Well I don't know what the hell it's
text: made of, but I can't crack it open.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: Good. Clear it off the table so I
dialog: can serve dinner.
text: 
text: Tom and Murph walk in. Murph's got another black eye.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened this time?
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: I got suspended. Paul said anyone
dialog: who believed we went to the moon was
dialog: an idiot. So I hit him.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Good boy. Hand me the scanner.
text: 
text: Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the
text: purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the
text: probe and turns on the power.
text: 
text: Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on
text: the controls and it PULSES.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Here we go. Standard NASA encryption.
text: Memory's been damaged. Just noise.
dialog: Hold on. I've got something.
text: 
text: Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into
text: the defibrillator. After a moment, an image fills the screen:
text: 
text: An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system
text: impossibly dense with stars. Murph stares, transfixed.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: Where is that, dad?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I don't know.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the probe.
dialog: 22.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Where the hell did you come from?
text: 
text: Cooper shrugs. Turns off the monitor.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow
dialog: and have it melted down. Might be
text: some copper inside.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: But what about its mission? What
dialog: about the information onboard?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: There's no one for it to report to.
dialog: NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son.
dialog: It got home too late.
text: 
text: Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot
text: unceremoniously onto the table.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: 
text: The boys have gone to bed. Cooper and Donald are alone at
text: the table. Donald hands Cooper another beer.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: I heard your meeting at the school
dialog: didn't go so well.
text: 
text: Cooper shakes his head in disgust.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Maybe it's better for everyone to
dialog: forget what they did back then.
dialog: Reminds us how far we've fallen.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: (looks down,)
dialog: When I was kid, it felt like they
dialog: made something new every day. Some
dialog: gadget or idea.
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: Like every day was Christmas.
dialog: (BEAT)
dialog: But we made a lot of mistakes. Six
dialog: billion people. Just try to imagine
dialog: that. Every last one of them trying
dialog: to have it all.
text: 
text: Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands.
dialog: 23.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: The truth is this world isn't that
dialog: bad. In a lot of ways its better.
dialog: Tom will be all right, whether he
dialog: goes to college or not.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: It doesn't bother me that he can't
dialog: go. It bothers me that he doesn't
dialog: care.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD
dialog: Tom isn't the problem. He fits in
dialog: this world just fine. You're the
dialog: one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't
dialog: belong here. You were born forty
dialog: years too late, or forty years too
dialog: early -- I don't know. My daughter
dialog: knew it, god bless her. And your
dialog: kids know it, too.
text: 
text: Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door. Stops,
text: one hand on the frame.
text: 
speaker_heading: DONALD (CONT'D)
dialog: You were good at something and you
dialog: never got a chance to do anything
dialog: with it. And I'm sorry, Coop. But
dialog: that's not your kids' fault.
text: 
text: Donald pushes out the screen door.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at his beer. The probe CHIRPS.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper flops down on his bed, fully clothed, exhausted. He
text: stares up at the ceiling. This is his life.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE.
text: 
text: Cooper BOLTS upright. Stumbles out the door.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. Cooper, holding
text: a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs.
text: 
text: Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him.
dialog: 24.
text: 
text: The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a
text: DEAFENING SCREAM.
text: 
text: Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. He
text: hits it with the paddles. No result.
text: 
text: He SMASHES it with the bat. Nothing. He HITS it AGAIN and
text: AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table
text: and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front
text: door. As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING.
text: 
text: Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. It
text: stops at the wall. After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN.
text: 
text: Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. Once
text: again, the movement shuts it up.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door.
text: It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt.
text: After a moment, the unholy RACKET starts up again.
text: 
text: Cooper keeps rolling it, but it doesn't seem to help. Murph
text: looks up, sees the stars overhead.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: Try a different direction.
text: 
text: As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then
text: picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps
text: it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: It's a fail-safe. It's going to
dialog: annoy us into taking it home.
text: 
text: Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins
text: SHRIEKING again.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What are we going to do?
text: 
text: Cooper gets a rope.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We're going to get some sleep.
text: 
text: He begins tying the rope around the probe.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around
text: his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant.
dialog: 25.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
text: 
text: Tom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended,
text: looks up at Cooper, smiling.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: What are we doing today?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You're staying here and cleaning the
dialog: house.
text: 
text: Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard.
text: Cooper follows his stare.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: I told you, Murph. There's no one
dialog: to take it back to.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: But what if there is, dad? What if
dialog: there's something we can salvage?
text: 
text: Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
text: 
text: The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,
text: putting in a pair of earplugs.
text: 
text: A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.
text: Cooper begins hauling the line up.
text: 
text: As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK
text: returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out
text: onto the ground.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
text: 
text: The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper
text: spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along
text: the dusty runway and into the air.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY
text: 
text: The tiny plane follows the mountains south.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it
dialog: did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa
text: Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken
dialog: and burned what was left of the homes in between.
dialog: 26.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up
text: to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and
text: disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become
dialog: ranchland, once again.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY
text: 
text: An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and
text: checks it over.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Got any diesel?
text: 
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.
text: 
text: Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows
text: the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,
text: the probe is HUMMING.
text: 
text: A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA
text: CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.
text: 
text: As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: I think it's home.
text: 
text: Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat
text: grassland in the center of the island.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
text: 
text: The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.
text: 
text: Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a
text: rifle over his shoulder.
text: 
text: A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.
text: Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with
text: bright red -- strawberries.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: Dad, what are these things?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I don't know. Don't touch them.
dialog: 27.
text: 
text: Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a
text: little off. He walks over.
text: 
text: He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS
text: against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage
text: scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical
dialog: transport truck.
text: 
text: Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Murph?
text: 
text: He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses
text: and heads into the forest to look for him.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.
text: Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk
dialog: of the tree is red hot.
text: 
text: Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged
text: chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.
text: 
text: Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive
text: tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some
text: kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.
text: 
text: Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a
dialog: clearing.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Careful. There's some kind of
dialog: underground facility here. We
dialog: might...
text: 
text: Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something:
text: 
text: Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing
text: an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: Is it still... alive?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't
dialog: made them for thirty years. I've
dialog: never seen one intact before.
text: 
text: Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy
text: frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like
dialog: it might have been standing here for decades.
dialog: 28.
text: 
text: Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.
text: He steps back, clearly a little spooked.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: I think we need to go, Murph.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: But can't we take it back? You could
dialog: fix it up, get him to do chores.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: No. I don't know what this place
dialog: is, but we're leaving.
text: 
text: Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy
text: and hoisting him up to eye level.
text: 
text: Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.
text: 
text: The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from
text: Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side
text: of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony.
text: 
text: Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as
text: hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses
text: Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Tell the boy to stop hitting me.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (IGNORING HIM)
text: Hit him in the back of the neck.
text: 
text: Murph raises the rifle butt. A voice stops him.
text: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I wouldn't do that.
text: 
text: A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. This is AMELIA BRAND --
dialog: tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that
text: she's pointing at Cooper.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We were just looking for salvage.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Is that what they call stealing these
dialog: days?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I didn't know it belonged to anyone.
dialog: 29.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: It doesn't.
dialog: (TO ROBOT)
dialog: You want to let them go, Tars, or do
dialog: you want some help with your work?
text: 
text: The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely.
text: Then lets him go.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You've got me wrong, lady.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Really? You're not the kind of guy
dialog: who turns a combat marine with a
dialog: supercomputer for a brain into a
dialog: riding lawn mower?
text: 
text: Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Get back in your little plane, go
dialog: back to your farming commune. And
dialog: don't come back.
text:

speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: Don't forget your gun.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (points at Tars)
dialog: Word of advice -- careful with that
dialog: thing. When the war was over, they
dialog: didn't know when to stop fighting.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I'd trust him a lot more than I'd
dialog: trust you. Keep moving.
text: 
text: Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him.
text: 
text: Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL.
text: Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane.
text: He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Wait a second--
text: 
text: Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls
text: out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Get it inside.
dialog: (MORE)

text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: (points rifle at Cooper)
dialog: You too. We'll figure out what to
dialog: do with you later.
text: 
text: Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a
text: huge, reinforced service elevator.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
text: 
text: Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide
text: diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below
text: the island's surface. She keeps her weapon shouldered.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Now who's stealing from who?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: This doesn't belong to you.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You're right. It belongs to NASA,
dialog: which shut down thirty years ago
dialog: when the federal government ran out
dialog: of money.
text: 
text: Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the
text: bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand
text: motions for Cooper to step forward.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
text: 
text: They step into a vast underground facility. Standing in the
text: center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket.
text: Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it.
text: 
text: Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Who are you people?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (WRY)
dialog: The government gave us plenty of
dialog: practice looking for our own funding.
dialog: (gestures with rifle)
dialog: Keep moving.
text: 
text: Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled
text: with electronic equipment. A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS
dialog: converge around Tars.
text: 
text: An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s, white-haired, this
dialog: is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years
dialog: earlier.
dialog: 31.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: I found them outside with it. It
dialog: looks like six. Maybe seven. I
text: can't tell from the radiation damage.
text: 
text: The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished.
text: 
speaker_heading: OLD ENGINEER
dialog: Where did you find it?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Galveston.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND'S FATHER
dialog: (thinking it over)
dialog: Of course. It must have been looking
dialog: for Canaveral.
text: 
text: Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. DOYLE,
text: 40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Canaveral's been gone for thirty
dialog: years.
text: 
text: Brand ignores him.
text: 
text: Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
text: It's not responding to the handshake.
dialog: I can't open anything on primary.
text: 
text: Brand looks up at Cooper.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: What did you do to it?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Nothing. I got something off of it.
text: 
text: Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall
text: with a battery powered defibrillator.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: (TO BRAND)
dialog: May I?
text: 
text: Brand nods, wary. Cooper walks over to the wall, takes the
text: defibrillator, and hooks it up to the probe. He taps into
text: the current and runs a lead into the terminal. Brand's Father
text: watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator.
dialog: 32.
text: 
speaker_heading: OLD ENGINEER
dialog: Of course. The high voltage allows
dialog: you to image the entire memory unit
dialog: at once.
text: 
text: Information begins appearing on the terminal's screen.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Most of the disk was noise. Couple
dialog: of clean sectors, though.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the
text: probe. The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it.
text: 
text: Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed.
text: 
text: The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier
text: pops onto the screen.
text: 
text: The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the
text: images.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: It found something.
dialog: (READING)
dialog: Very thin nitrogen-based atmosphere.
dialog: Trace radiation. Surface is ninety
dialog: percent frozen water. Ten percent
dialog: rock -- sedimentary composition
dialog: similar to limestone.
dialog: (READING)
dialog: Wow. Pockets of oxygen below the
dialog: surface. Lots and lots of oxygen.
dialog: (EXCITED)
dialog: This could be the one, boss.
text: 
text: The older engineer studies the image of the ice-covered
dialog: planet, thinking.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: There aren't any planets like that
dialog: anywhere near earth. Not even if
dialog: this thing was gone for thirty years.
text: 
text: Brand looks at Cooper, appraising. She turns to the older
dialog: engineer.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: He's heard enough. If we're going
dialog: to launch, we need to keep them here
dialog: until afterwards.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You can't keep us here.
dialog: 33.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: He could endanger the mission.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I'm not going to endanger it any
dialog: more than you already have.
text: 
text: Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by
text: a robot on a nearby bench.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you using that for guidance?
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Why not? We've tested it a hundred
dialog: times.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: The power supply is no good. If the
dialog: voltage fluctuates under load, the
dialog: unit will fail.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Now how could you possibly know that?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Bought thirty of them off a guy in
dialog: Florida. Had to rebuild every last
dialog: one.
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: They work great on a riding lawn mower.
text: 
text: Brand looks back at the telemetry system. The older engineer
text: watches the exchange, thinking.
text: 
text: CUT TO:
text: 
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper and Murph have been locked in an abandoned machine
text: shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in
text: various states of disrepair. Tars is blocking the door.
text: 
text: Cooper stands. Tars wags a long, hydraulic finger at him.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You plan on keeping us here forever?
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: (SHRUGS)
dialog: My battery has a duty cycle of five
dialog: hundred years.
text: 
text: Cooper gives up. He turns back.
dialog: 34.
text: 
text: The back of the shop is filled with a group of older ROBOTS
text: who are overhauling an engine. One problem -- the engine
text: isn't there. Their programming hasn't been updated to reflect
dialog: their obsolescence.
text: 
text: Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about their
text: business, efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers
text: into a non-existent thruster cone. The bolts CLATTER to the
text: ground as the robots stop to reload.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: What are they doing, dad?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I guess no one told them they were
dialog: out of a job.
dialog: (nods at Tars)
dialog: Same as the rest of these people.
text: 
text: Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand
text: and the older engineer are arguing about something. She
text: finally relents and walks towards the door.
text: 
text: Brand walks in. She gestures for Cooper to follow.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: The mission commander wants to see
dialog: you. Your son can stay here. He'll
dialog: be all right with Tars.
text: 
text: Cooper eyes Tars warily. Then steps outside.

scene_heading: EXT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
text: 
text: They walk across the space towards the base of the rocket,

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I thought the old man was in charge.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (ANNOYED)
dialog: The 'old man' is my father.
dialog: And he was in charge. But he decided
dialog: that we needed someone who could
dialog: lead the mission for the foreseeable
dialog: future.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Not you?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I'm a biologist.
dialog: 35.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (LAUGHS)
dialog: You don't look like one.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: With the rifle, I mean.
text: 
text: Brand heads towards a group of large maintenance ROBOTS
text: clustered at the base of the rocket. A smaller, human sized
text: robot is staring at the rocket, giving them instructions.
text: 
text: The robot looks up. This is CASE, the leader of the mission.
dialog: Originally an air force pararescue officer, every part of
text: him, from his alloy chassis to his voice, was designed to
text: inspire respect and confidence. He turns to Cooper.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: You're the man who brought us the
dialog: probe?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Thank you. We tested the telemetry
dialog: board you warned us about. It failed
dialog: under high voltage, just as you said.
dialog: Come with me, please.

scene_heading: INT. MISSION CONTROL, UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY
text: 
text: The lights dim as Brand's father brings up a schematic of
text: our solar system. Case points to the picture of the ice
dialog: planet recovered from the probe.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: You're right, Mr. Cooper. The planet
dialog: you saw is a long way from earth. A
dialog: very long way indeed.
text: 
text: Brand looks down. Case notices.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE (CONT'D)
dialog: Our science officer doesn't think I
dialog: should trust you with any of this.
dialog: One of the curious things about humans
dialog: is that the more alike you are, the
dialog: more initially hostile you are to
dialog: each other. As if by design.
text: 
text: Brand makes eye contact with Cooper, then looks away,
dialog: embarrassed.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE (CONT'D)
dialog: I've found the best way to earn a

text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND'S FATHER
text: It's a wormhole. A shortcut leading

text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND'S FATHER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Based on the information on the probe,

text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: The main ship was built in orbit.

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Why are you telling me this? I
dialog: already told you I'm not going to

text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: I know you won't, Mr. Cooper. We're
dialog: telling you this because I want you
dialog: to join us.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at him. Is he serious?
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE (CONT'D)
dialog: The probe has taken a great deal
dialog: longer to return to us than we hoped.

dialog: 37.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dr. Brand's Father and several other
dialog: members of our crew have gotten...
dialog: older.
text: 
text: Brand's Father looks down, stoic. Brand looks angry.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE (CONT'D)
dialog: We need someone who can run the
dialog: systems, improvise, work with what's
dialog: available. All of the skills you
dialog: seem to have developed.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: But I don't have any of the

dialog: have been preparing for this for
dialog: years.
text: 
text: Case shakes his head.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Humans worry about things like rank
dialog: and experience. I'm only concerned
dialog: with whether someone would be useful.
dialog: (BEAT)
dialog: I think you'd be useful, Mr. Cooper.
text: 
text: Cooper is stunned. This is the offer he's waited his whole
dialog: life for. And it's come too late.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: No. I'm sorry.
text: 
text: Cooper is deeply conflicted. But he can't leave his boys
text: behind.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't help you. I have

text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: I'm not a scientist, Mr. Cooper.

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: The blight.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: In the last century strands were

text: 
text: Cooper looks at the dying corn.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: But it doesn't affect the corn.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Not yet. But it will. We've grown

speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Who's going to find it? The

dialog: (LOOKS AWAY)
dialog: The earth has had enough of us. We

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You've known this for how long? And
dialog: you didn't try to tell anyone?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: What would be the point? So humanity
dialog: could spend the last fifty years of
dialog: its life fighting over the scraps?
dialog: It's better that they don't know.

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (QUIET)
dialog: That's why you're looking for a planet
dialog: with oxygen. Water.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: A new home for humanity. We'll set
dialog: up a colony, then return to bring

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: But you'd still only be able to save

speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Look -- I don't have a clue what

text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: You can set that down over there.

text: Cooper sets the board down. His eye is drawn to a bizarre
text: experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning
text: centrifuge. Brand notices.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: We didn't know what kind of gravity
dialog: to expect. We experimented with

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We're taking ants with us?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Humans are also collective organisms.

speaker_heading: COOPER

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Looks like hard work.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: It's a paradox. Life couldn't form
dialog: without gravity. No stars. No

speaker_heading: CASE (CONT'D)
dialog: Based on our latest modelling we

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Is that a star?
text: 
text: ROTH, 50s, the crew's brilliant and blunt physicist, zooms
text: the map in, revealing, at the center, a black heart.
dialog: 46.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: No. A black hole. There are several
dialog: in the region, but this is the largest --
dialog: a billion times heavier than the
dialog: sun. I call it Gargantua.
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: Beautiful, isn't it? It's a shame
dialog: we won't get to see it up close.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (LAUGHS)
dialog: You'd like that, wouldn't you, Roth?
text: Falling into a massive black hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH

text: 
text: Case continues. Doyle leans over to Cooper, conspiratorially.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (LOW)
dialog: Don't worry about Roth. He's nuts.
dialog: But Case says that means he's ideally
dialog: suited for space travel.
text: 
text: Case repositions the map near a much smaller black hole that
dialog: is orbiting Gargantua.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: We're headed for this smaller black
dialog: hole. Roth calls it Pantagruel. We
dialog: think the ice planet is here-
text: 
text: Case draws a finger through the air, leaving a red trail.
text: He traces the trajectory their ship will take.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE (CONT'D)
dialog: We exit the wormhole here. And we
text: slingshot around Pantagruel to reach
dialog: the ice planet. This is the period
dialog: in which we'll lose time.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Lose time?
text: 
text: Roth shifts the hologram -- the stars and black holes flatten
text: onto a sheet that bends, revealing the curvature of gravity.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: High speed or high gravity both slow
dialog: down time, relative to earth.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: 47.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH (CONT'D)
dialog: The trip around the black hole will
dialog: take us only a few days. But far
dialog: more time will be passing back home.
text: 
text: The ship's trajectory cuts through the deep gravity well of
text: the smaller black hole to reach the ice planet.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: How much time?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Based on the information from the
dialog: probe -- as much as five years.
text: 
text: Doyle looks at the tiny ship's trajectory, threaded between
text: two black holes. He looks worried.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I still think we're making a lot of
dialog: assumptions. About the wormhole.
dialog: About the planet.
dialog: (points to map)
dialog: The critical orbit here is incredibly
dialog: dangerous. It's like walking on the
text: rim of the volcano.
dialog: (BEAT)
dialog: Too fast and we get thrown off at
dialog: close to the speed of light. Too
text: slow and we get pulled into the hole
dialog: and crushed.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: As long as we're careful, we'll make
dialog: it.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: How do you know that?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I find it hard to believe that someone
dialog: would build a wormhole to a planet
dialog: with water and oxygen just to lead
dialog: us to a dead end.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I thought you were a scientist, Brand.
dialog: That sounds more like a hypothesis.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: A guess. That's right. We don't
dialog: have time to wait for conclusive
dialog: proof.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: 48.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: My guess is that the wormhole is
dialog: there because someone is trying to
dialog: help us. The same way we used to
dialog: try to help animals when they were
dialog: threatened with extinction.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Sure. Till we ran out of food and
dialog: ate all of them.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (ANNOYED)
dialog: I guess I'm also assuming that whoever
dialog: built the wormhole has a better plan
dialog: than we did. If I'm wrong, we'll
dialog: die, same as we'd die here anyway.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What do you think, Roth?
text: 
text: Roth leans forward, studying the map.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: If we're guessing, then I'd say
dialog: Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't
dialog: exist naturally. I think it's there
dialog: for a reason. That someone is trying
dialog: to help us.
text: 
text: Brand looks satisfied.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: So you think we'll have no problem
text: navigating between two massive black
dialog: holes to a tiny planet?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: I think we'll probably be killed.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: I said I thought there was a plan.
dialog: Not that the plan was for us to find
dialog: a planet like Earth to save a handful
dialog: of people.
dialog: (SHAKES HEAD)
dialog: Birds don't learn to fly just so
dialog: that they can find another egg and
text: crawl back into it.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: If that's not the plan, then what
dialog: are we supposed to be doing out there?
dialog: 49.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: (SHRUGS)
dialog: To keep moving. Seeking. Learning.
dialog: But I don't know.
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: We don't understand how they built

dialog: we could understand their plan,
dialog: either?

dialog: If we find a habitable environment,

scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION
text:

text: 
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE SHOP, SPACE STATION
text: 
text: One of the robots leads Cooper through a long lab-like room
dialog: filled with machines capable of fabricating almost anything

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Oh, no. I want to see this.

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: Good morning, sunshine.
dialog: 52.

text: his mirth at Tars's newfound lack of stature.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Bit of a demotion.
text: 
text: Tars turns back toward Cooper. He puffs out his chest and

text: 
speaker_heading: TARS

text: 
scene_heading: INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: The crew move into the tight, claustrophobic outer layer of
text: the ship. They will have very little room as the ship passes
text: through the wormhole.
text: 
text: Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during
text: transit. Then he tethers himself to the hull wall.
text: 
text: Case is the last to join them. He detaches a small control
text: module from the console, then pulls himself into the outer
text: hull and seals the passageway.
text: 
text: Case presses a button on the control module. With a GROAN,
text: the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
text: 
text: The ship's hull begins to CRACK open, revealing the inner
dialog: chamber.
dialog: 60.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: The SHUDDERING continues. The crew watch nervously as the
text: control chamber below them suddenly opens itself to the cold
text: blackness of space.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
text: 
text: The ship silently rolls itself into position, pointing the
text: opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth.
text: 
text: Slowly, the Endurance pushes itself forward, closer and closer
text: to the crystal-like mouth. Finally, it envelops the mouth,
text: bringing it into the open chamber.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: As the crew watch, the wormhole mouth is positioned in the
text: center of the inner compartment.
text: 
text: Case presses a sequence key on the control panel and the
text: ship's hull closes again, trapping the wormhole inside it.
text: 
text: With a GRUMBLE, the ship begins contracting, squeezing itself
text: down around the wormhole mouth.
text: 
text: Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship begins
text: gently lowering itself into the wormhole mouth, feeding itself
text: into the wormhole from the inside out. Cooper watches as
text: Doyle is swallowed into the compressing ship with a GRUNT.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: Would you like me to make a joke?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (FIRM)
dialog: No.
text: 
text: Cooper's turn: he is fed into the hole, legs first, then
text: waist, torso, and, finally, his head.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE
text: 
text: The Endurance shrinks as it sinks from the inside out into
dialog: the wormhole.
text: 
text: After a moment, it's gone. The only thing left behind is
text: the comms relay, drifting in space, waiting for a signal.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: The ship continues to slide through the wormhole. Through
text: the outer hull they see images of themselves repeating -- a
text: trick of the narrow collar of space they are sinking through.
text: Cooper smiles at himself. The experience is unnerving.
dialog: 61.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Where are we?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: (SMILING)
dialog: Nowhere. Nowhere at all.
text: 
dialog: Nowhere is still pretty damn claustrophobic.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
text: The hull is intact. Thirty more
text: seconds transit.
text: 
text: For a moment, the ship slides gently, silently, through the
text: wormhole. The quiet is eery.
text: 
text: Suddenly, a point of distortion appears in the hull next to
text: Cooper. It looks like someone is pushing against the hull
text: of the ship with a giant finger.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
text: Something's happening to the hull
dialog: over here.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Hull integrity is fine.
text: 
text: The distortion moves along the hull, growing in diameter.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Well, I don't know what your display
dialog: is telling you but something is
dialog: happening over here.
text: 
text: Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I've got a problem over here, too.
text: 
text: Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner
text: wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material
text: of the hull.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from
text: the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him,
text: bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind
text: it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
text: It's not the hull... it's inside the
dialog: ship... it's...
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: It's beautiful.
dialog: 62.
text: 
text: Roth watches as the distortions move through the ship. His
dialog: curiosity doesn't make anyone else feel any better.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What the hell are they, Case?
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: I don't know. It could be
dialog: gravitational turbulence.
text: 
text: The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: It's getting bigger.
text: 
text: Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere absorbs
text: it, twisting Doyle's hand. Doyle CRIES OUT.
text: 
text: His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled.
text: But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: It's not bending your hand. It's
dialog: bending the space around your hand.
text: 
text: The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. Doyle is
dialog: freaking out.
text: 
text: The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also.
text: He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and
text: distorting his body.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: This isn't turbulence. Look at the
text: way they're moving -- it's like
text: something's examining us.
text: 
text: Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the
dialog: length of it.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Can you ask it to stop?
text: 
text: Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish.
text: For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the
dialog: encounter.
text: 
text: An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to
text: distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres
text: joined. The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: The wormhole is splitting into two
text: paths. Radiation is pouring from
text: one path to the other.
dialog: 63.
text: 
text: Case stares at the controls. Decides.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Release the second mouth.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: None of our testing involved opening
text: the ship inside the wormhole. We
dialog: have no idea what might happen.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: We're going to find out.
text: 
text: Doyle reaches over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a
dialog: sequence.
text: 
text: After a moment, the hull cracks open, creating a channel
text: through which the radiating mouth can escape.
text: 
text: The opening in the ship allows the pressure to begin to
text: concentrate on one fracture point. The ship SHUDDERS as
text: it's squeezed along its axis.
text: 
text: Case punches in a code and the ship begins to close again,
text: painstakingly slowly. Finally, the ship calms as it closes
text: around the original wormhole.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're reaching the far end of the
dialog: wormhole.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the wormhole mouth begins to grow inside the inner
text: chamber. What was a ball of light spreads out into a black
text: canvas studded with points of light -- like looking into the
dialog: universe through the wrong end of a telescope.
text: 
text: Cooper presses himself against the wall and holds on as the
text: hull beneath him opens outward.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE
text: 
text: The Endurance emerges from the opposite end of the wormhole
text: from the inside out. It drifts in space.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: For a moment, the crew are silent, taking it in.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Look at that.
text: 
text: Roth is looking through the translucent panel on the hull.
text: 
dialog: They are on the warped side of the universe.
dialog: 64.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. WORMHOLE MOUTH, WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE
text: 
text: The vista is dazzling -- an ocean of massive stars and black
text: holes, some adorned with jets and brilliant gas disks.
text: 
text: At the center, like a king at the center of his court, is
text: Gargantua, plasma jets spewing from its poles.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: The crew pull themselves back into the control deck from the

text: all directions as Endurance passes the light into the cabin.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Reconfigure the engines and test the
text: communications array.
text: 
text: The crew break themselves away from the view and get to work.
dialog: Roth begins adapting his models of the local system with the
text: real observational data pouring in from the ship's
dialog: instruments.
text: 
text: Cooper pulls himself to the comms post. PINGS the relay
text: they left on the far side of the wormhole.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. WORMHOLE MOUTH 'A', SPACE
text: 
text: The blue and white comms relay LIGHTS up as it receives a
dialog: packet through the wormhole.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. ENDURANCE
text: 
text: After a nervous moment, the comms computer TONES with a
text: response -- they're still in touch with the Earth.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: It's working.
text: 
text: Tars finishes reeling the nuclear engines back in from their
text: tether and locks them into place.
text: 
text: Roth's updated model appears on the monitors. Brand stares
text: at it, startled.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: We're moving.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: That's not possible. We haven't
dialog: activated the engines yet.
text: 
text: The ship's skin illuminates, overlaying a plotted course on
text: top of the view.
dialog: 65.
text: 
text: They are moving, very rapidly, on a course that leads directly
text: between the black hulks of Gargantua and Pantagruel.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Roth. Why are we moving?
text: 
text: Roth looks at the stars, then back to his model.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: The smaller black hole. We're much
dialog: closer to it than the models
dialog: predicted. We're being pulled by
text: its swirl. Very quickly.
text: 
text: The crew looks out through the hull. They are being pulled
text: into Pantagruel's swirl -- a glittering disc of matter
text: spinning at high speed around the hole.
text: 
text: Doyle looks behind them. The wormhole mouth is rapidly
text: growing smaller.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Doyle. Fire the engines. Now.
text: 
text: The ship's engines FIRE, straining to fight the irresistible
text: pull of the supermassive black hole. They won't be able to
dialog: fight it for long.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: We're being pulled into it?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: No. I don't think so...
text: 
text: Roth looks at the instrumentation for a moment.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH (CONT'D)
text: It appears to be pulling us on exactly
dialog: the trajectory we modelled. If we
dialog: try to fight it, we could push
dialog: ourselves off of that trajectory.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You don't know that.
text: 
text: Case stares ahead into the darkness.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: We should turn off the engines. Let

text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (FRANTIC)
dialog: Listen to me.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: 66.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: If the modelling was wrong, then we
dialog: can't be sure about anything. We
dialog: need to go back.
text: 
dialog: Case thinks it over. Decides.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Shut down the engines.
text: 
text: The engines shut down.
text: 
text: SILENCE. The ship drifts for a moment in the swirl, then
text: begins to move.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ENDURANCE
text: 
text: The ship accelerates as it is pulled by the irresistible
text: force of the black hole onto an inspiraling orbit.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: The crew watch as the ship hurtles around the black hole at
dialog: higher and higher speeds.
text: 
text: The sky overhead begins to spin due to their motion -- faster
text: and faster until it becomes a blur. The ship begins to GROAN
text: as it appears to be pulled in two different directions.
text: 
text: The ship is now speeding around the black hole at incredible
text: speed -- one revolution every four seconds. The crew are
text: suddenly SLAMMED against the hull in opposite directions --
text: some towards the black hole, some towards the opposite side.
text: 
text: Roth looks at his model, which shows the projected path of
text: the ship. It looks perilously close to the event horizon.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: It's the tidal gravity caused by the
dialog: black hole. It means we're right on
dialog: the critical orbit.
text: 
text: The comms screen lights up, TONING again and again, as it
text: receives a long garbled update. Then it shuts down. Cooper
text: drags himself along the hull until he reaches the controls.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We've lost contact with the relay.
text: 
text: Case joins Cooper at the comms screen.
text: 
text: While they're distracted, Doyle maneuvers himself over to
text: the engine control.
dialog: 67.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: One long garbled transmission came
dialog: in. Then nothing.
text: 
text: Case looks at the screen.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the ship is JOLTED as the engines fire at full
dialog: power.
text: 
text: The crew looks over. Doyle is standing by the controls.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I'm sorry. I can't let you kill us.
dialog: We have to go back.
text: 
text: The engines strain to fight the swirl -- but they're
text: hopelessly outgunned by the gravity of the black hole.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Instead of reversing course, the Endurance begins to speed
text: up, as it plummets closer and closer to the black hole.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Doyle's face sinks as he watches the controls -- on the
text: 'volcano' model, the ship is now passing the crest and
text: spiraling towards destruction. He has made a tragic mistake.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Why isn't it slowing down?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: We're being pulled towards the event
text: horizon.
text: 
text: ALARMS begin sounding throughout the ship as the projected
text: course on Roth's model shifts, showing the Endurance being
text: pushed up the rim, past the critical orbit and down towards
text: the black hole's event horizon.
text: 
text: Case takes control of the ship, trying to fire the engines
text: forwards to speed them back up to safety, but it's too late.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: (CALM)
dialog: The engines don't have enough power
dialog: to push us back.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: They would if we used it all at once.
text: 
text: Cooper is still trying to understand what Roth means as Tars
text: locks himself into the engine compartment.
dialog: 68.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What is he doing?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Saving us.
text: 
text: Tars tears open the engine's control panel and begins
dialog: overriding it.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Tars rips out the cooling circuitry. Then, holding on tight,
text: he fires the engine.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: The crew watch as Tars holds the engine, blasting it at full
text: power into the swirl. The engine heats up white-hot.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Prime the remaining engine. When he
dialog: detonates it, we'll only have a few
dialog: seconds. If we overshoot we could
text: be pulled into the bigger hole.
text: 
text: Roth moves to the controls.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Secure yourselves. The ship should
dialog: be able to withstand the blast.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What about Tars?
text: 
text: As the crew watches, Tars continues to hold the engine even
text: as the casing around it begins to melt. Finally, it EXPLODES.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE
text: 
text: Tars is thrown backwards from the explosion, tumbling through
text: space as the ship is ROCKETED upwards.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. ENDURANCE
text: 
text: The ship is SLAMMED by the explosion. Cooper and the rest
text: of the crew are SMASHED against the hull. Doyle is knocked
text: unconscious. Brand steps over to him and cradles his head,
text: trying to protect him.
text: 
text: On Roth's model, the course slowly pushes outward, out of
text: the danger zone, back to the original delicate orbit.
text: 
text: As they near the original orbit, Case fires the remaining
text: engine, pushing them back onto the outspiraling orbit.
dialog: 69.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: It's going to be close, but we're
dialog: going to make it.
text: 
text: Brand looks at the instruments. Points to a tiny radar
text: contact receding towards the massive black hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
text: Tars. His transponder is still
dialog: working.
text: 
text: The ship's instruments TONE every few seconds as it
text: communicates with Tars' onboard computer.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
text: He's being pulled toward Gargantua.
dialog: We can't help him.
text: 
text: The crew watch, helpless, as the tones grow further and
text: further apart. Then they stop.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at Doyle, anger rising. Then he looks down.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE AROUND PANTAGRUEL
text: 
text: The Endurance slowly spirals back away from Pantagruel, the
text: sky slowing as the orbit grows longer.
text: 
text: Finally, a tiny speck of light appears in front of the ship.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text:

text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: We're here.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: As Roth and Doyle study the frozen planet below, Cooper tries
text: in vain to signal the relay on the Earth side of the wormhole.
text: 
text: Brand and Case are having a private conversation away from
text: everyone else. Cooper walks over.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I still can't contact the relay.
text: 
text: Brand ignores him at first. She nods at Case.
dialog: 70.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you hear me? We're not able to
dialog: communicate back home.
text: 
text: She waves him off. But she looks shaken by something.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I've already checked it. It's
dialog: electromagnetic interference. We'll
dialog: try again in a few hours.
text: 
text: Cooper begins to ask her what's wrong, but she moves off.
text: 
text: Roth looks up from his monitor, excited.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
text: I've got a signal. But it's local.
text: 
text: A familiar CHIRP plays over the ship's speakers.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH (CONT'D)
dialog: The remaining probes. We found them.
text: 
text: She looks at the monitor. The probes ping the ship with
text: their locations, which pop up on the monitor. They're all

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: How could they all have landed in
dialog: the same place?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: Let's go find out.
text: 
text: Case programs a course that will lock the ship in orbit above

text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET
text: 
text: The ship settles into orbit a few hundred kilometers above
text: the surface of the ice planet. It can't get any closer:
text: 
text: The space below it is choked with hundreds of tiny moons --
text: a cruder version of Saturn's rings. The moons are hurtling

text: 
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK, ENDURANCE

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We're bringing him along?
dialog: 71.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: We need all the help we can get.
dialog: Besides, the alternative is to leave

text: 
scene_heading: INT. LANDER
text: 
text: The crew watches, fascinated, as the ship descends, navigating
text: between the moons that hurtle past.
text: 
dialog: The moons are vastly different than our own; potato shaped

text: 
text: The team sets out, moving slowly in their cumbersome suits.
text: 
text: Lit by the nebula, the surroundings are a little brighter
dialog: than a full moon on Earth.
text: 
text: Not that there's much to look at. They are standing on a

text: 
text: Brand takes a surface reading of the ice.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (RADIO)
dialog: The probe was right. Looks like
dialog: significant amounts of oxygen trapped
dialog: in the ice.
text: 
text: Case leads the way, drawn by a signal only he can hear. He
text: walks fifty yards, then stops on a gentle slope that leads
text: down into a small valley.
dialog: 72.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: The other probes should be directly
dialog: beneath us.
text: 
text: Case and the others begin digging into the hillside. Cooper
text: is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four
text: feet high. He takes out a small folding shovel and begins
text: scraping at the ice and snow.
text: 
text: Case hits something solid. But it's not a probe. He digs
text: around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the
text: hillside, revealing the outline of something metal:
text: 
text: A door. They're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's
text: a shelter. The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it.
text: 
text: A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to
text: reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice. He
text: scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric:
text: 
text: It's the flag of the People's Republic of China.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: How could the Chinese have gotten
dialog: here first? The federal government
dialog: kept the wormhole a secret.
text: 
text: Case shrugs. He has a soldier's gallows humor about his old
dialog: employer's ability to keep anything a secret.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: They didn't do a very good job.
text: 
text: Case reaches for the door of the shelter. It's sealed shut
text: with ice. He wrenches it open.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Case steps into the shelter, followed by the rest of the
text: crew. His lights pick up several years worth of dust.
text: 
text: Case steps up to an equipment locker. Forces it open. Inside
text: are half a dozen black probes. Exposed to light, the probes
text: begin TONING like the one Cooper found in Texas.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: The Chinese must have captured them.
dialog: So they couldn't return to us.
text: 
text: The crew stare at the probes for a moment, taking it in.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Then how did the probe that Cooper
dialog: found return?
dialog: 73.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: The more immediate question is what
dialog: happened to the Chinese expedition.
text: There's no sign of their ship in
dialog: orbit. And they never returned to
dialog: earth.
text: 
text: Roth picks up an ancient vacuum sealed package of pickled

scene_heading: INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT
text: 
text: The structure is filled with drilling equipment. Cooper and
text: the rest of the team stand at the edge of a three-foot hole
text: that has been drilled into the ice.
text: 
text: A descending rig is anchored to the top of the hole. Doyle
text: and Case struggle to pull themselves out of the hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: It goes down for a hundred and fifty
text: feet, then stops. Tunnel's old --
text: the ice has reformed at the bottom.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I'm going to descend to take some
dialog: samples. Cooper, want to make
dialog: yourself useful?
text: 
text: Cooper begins to say something, then bites his tongue.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper emerges, loaded down with several containers of Brand's
dialog: equipment.
text: 
text: As he struggles through the wind and snow, his radio picks
text: up data chatter between the mother ship and Case. The comms
text: are just noise. After a moment, Case's voice cuts in.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE (O.S.)
dialog: Get back here, Cooper. We've got a
dialog: problem.
text: 
text: Cooper continues to wade through the snow. Suddenly, he
text: trips over something, dropping the equipment.
text: 
text: Cooper looks back. He tripped on a white plastic post
text: sticking out of the snow. He dusts it off, to reveal a
text: picture of a Chinese Taikonaut smiling in his flight suit.
dialog: This is a grave marker.
text: 
text: Cooper sweeps his hand through the snow, revealing three
text: more white posts with pictures. The entire human crew has
dialog: been buried here.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Roth and Case are looking at a portable monitor, showing a
text: projection of the nearby system -- the ice planet is a speck
text: orbiting the local black hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: The entire human crew is buried out
dialog: there in the snow.
dialog: 75.
text: 
text: Roth looks up from the monitor and assesses the situation
text: with his usual detachment.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: I think I know what killed them.
dialog: This planet isn't the only thing
dialog: orbiting this black hole.
text: 
text: Roth zooms the monitor in, revealing a tiny, impossibly-bright
text: object appearing at the horizon of the black hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a neutron star. The black hole
dialog: shields the planet's surface from it
dialog: for twenty hours at a stretch. Time's
text: about up.
text: 
text: Even Brand looks rattled.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: How long do we have left?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: About five minutes.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Then what?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Then we die. The radiation will
dialog: cook us alive.
text: 
text: Cooper looks around, their predicament settling in. Case
text: walks over to the edge of the mine shaft.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: We have to go down.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What about returning to the ship?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Not enough time. Case is right.
dialog: The ice can shield us from some of
dialog: the x-rays.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: It would take a thousand feet of ice
dialog: to shield us.
text: 
text: Brand gives up on the argument, sheds her equipment and clips
text: herself to the line to follow Case down into the ice.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at Doyle, then follows her.
dialog: 76.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper descends into the shaft. The only light is from his
text: suit's light array.
text: 
text: He reaches the bottom of the shaft, which opens into a small
text: cave, the ice ribbed in wave-like patterns like the seafloor.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What is this?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: A pocket formed by gas. There may
dialog: be more below.
text: 
text: The ice below them reveals nothing but murky blackness.
text: Case has found some of the equipment left behind by the
text: Chinese -- a battery-powered drill and a pick.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: We'll never make it far enough down.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Shut up. How much time do we have,
dialog: Roth?
text: 
text: Roth checks his watch with his usual detachment.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: About three minutes or so until we're
text: fully exposed.
text: 
text: The rad meter Brand is holding begins to CHIRP with activity --
dialog: the radiation levels are rising. The ice will not be enough
dialog: to protect them.
text: 
text: Cooper sees that Brand has exhausted herself with the pick.
text: He takes over for her.
text: 
text: The drill that Case is operating GROANS as the thirty-year-
text: old battery runs out of charge. Case casts it aside and
text: begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand.
text: 
text: Brand is looking at the walls of the ice pocket, looking for
text: fissures. Her lights pick out something in the ice. She
text: LOOKS CLOSER:
text: 
text: Tiny black flecks. Brand, ever the scientist, forgets their
text: predicament and begins chipping at the ice.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I've found something.
text: 
text: Case continues to pummel the ice with his hand, which is
text: badly smashed.
dialog: 77.
text: 
text: He pulls off the hand and continues to hack away at the ice
text: with the stump, trying to save his crew.
text: 
text: Brand is examining a piece of ice in her hands, which contains
text: several black flecks. As she shines her light on them, they
text: FLUORESCE, giving off a tiny flicker of light, like a firefly.
text: Brand steps back.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: These things... they're alive.
text: 
text: Roth joins her, looking down at the tiny creatures trapped
text: in the ice. Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again,
text: but nothing happens. Roth takes the depth meter dangling by
text: a lanyard from Brand's suit.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: It's not your light they're responding
dialog: to. It's this--
text: 
text: Roth takes the depth meter and waves it over the ice.
text: Suddenly, the black flecks begin to shine.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
text: X-rays. They feed on them and emit
text: visible light. They've found a way
dialog: to survive here.
text: 
text: Roth looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms
text: trapped in the ice, mesmerized.
text: 
text: Case hammers down with his arm, gouging a deep hole in the
text: ice below. Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. He's found
text: the gas pocket beneath them.
text: 
text: Too late. Roth's rad meter begins BEEPING frantically.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ICE PLANET -- ALIEN DAWN
text: 
text: Overhead, a tiny ball is orbiting into view from the dark
text: side of the black hole -- the NEUTRON STAR.
text: 
text: Its humble size belies its power. As its rays hit the ice,
text: the ice CRACKLES with energy.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- ALIEN DAWN
text: 
text: Brand steps back from the ice in awe as it begins to glow.
text: The microbes are absorbing the x-rays and emitting light.
text: Within seconds, they are bathed in an incredible glow.
text: 
text: Even Cooper stops, awed by the beauty of the display. Only
text: Case is unmoved, continuing to SMASH at the ice with the
text: broken end of his wrist.
dialog: 78.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (looks at rad meter)
dialog: They're absorbing most of the x-rays.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Not enough, unfortunately.
text: 
text: Suddenly, a CRACK as Case punches into the ice. Cooper looks
text: down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Case, wait--
text: 
text: Case PUNCHES again. Suddenly, with a great BANG, the ice
text: floor disintegrates beneath them.
text: 
text: They fall into the darkness.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CAVERN -- ALIEN DAWN
text: 
text: Cooper falls. For a moment, the only light he can see is
text: from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him.
text: 
text: As they fall, the light from the microbes trapped in the ice
text: above sweeps across the inside of the cavern, illuminating
text: the floor of the massive cavern thousands of feet down.
text: 
dialog: The rock formations they saw on the surface are actually the
text: tip of a mountain range extending into the distance,
text: disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover.
text: 
text: The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like
text: foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea. On the
text: far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into
text: the distance, supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof.
text: 
text: Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling
text: towards the huge inland sea below.
text: 
text: Seconds before impact, a tiny warning light flickers on inside
text: his helmet: IMPACT DETECTED.
text: 
text: Suddenly, a small drag chute EXPLODES from a panel on the
text: back of suit, slowing his fall. Airbags EXPLODE on his legs
text: and torso to cushion the impact.
text: 
text: Cooper SMASHES into the water.
text: 
text: BLACKNESS.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper comes to underwater, as liquid is flowing into his
text: suit from his shattered helmet.
dialog: 79.
text: 
text: Bubbles pour out from his suit and Cooper GASPS as his helmet
text: fills with water and he begins to sink.
text: 
text: As he sinks, Cooper pulls off his helmet, then tears off
text: pieces of his suit. He forces himself through the neck of
text: the suit and then swims upward.
text: 
text: He is about to surface when he remembers where he is. He
text: hesitates, just beneath the surface, lungs tightening as he
text: runs out of oxygen.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SEA, ICE PLANET -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper breaks the surface, COUGHS out water, and takes a
text: panicked breath.
text: 
text: He waits. Nothing happens. He opens his mouth again and
text: breathes in almost pure oxygen. He can breathe.
text: 
text: Treading water, he looks around. Spots lights in the water
text: below nearby -- Brand, in her suit, is sinking.
text: 
text: He dives down and struggles to haul her up by the suit.
text: 
text: Cooper breaks the surface, looks at Brand. Her mask is also
dialog: broken.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Breathe. Trust me.
text: 
text: She refuses at first. Water is bubbling into her suit through
text: the open mask. Finally, she takes a deep breath.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Your suit is filling with water.
dialog: I'm not going to be able to hold it
dialog: much longer. I'm going to let go.
text: 
text: Brand's eyes widen.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: What do you mean, you're going to
dialog: let go?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Take a deep breath.
text: 
text: Brand takes a deep breath and Cooper lets go of her.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY
text: 
text: Brand sinks. Cooper swims down, following her, ripping away
text: at her suit. The tear-away seals on her suit are stuck fast,
dialog: damaged in the fall.
dialog: 80.
text: 
text: Cooper finally breaks them off. Brand pulls herself out,
text: free, and they swim for the surface.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper drags himself out of the water and onto the beach.
text: He turns back to offer Brand a hand. She waves him off.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I don't need your help.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I thought we were supposed to be a
dialog: collective organism.
text: 
text: She gives up and lets him help her out of the water.
text: 
text: They sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Thank you.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Don't mention it.
text: 
text: Cooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent,
text: like glass, and polished to an impossible shine.
text: 
text: He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in
text: their suits, out of the water.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
text: 
text: Doyle and Roth have stripped down from their suits and are
dialog: breathing in the pure oxygen atmosphere.
text: 
text: Case and Cooper are pulling modular pieces from their
text: equipment packs to form a small shelter.
text: 
text: Brand is taking readings with her instruments.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Oxygen atmosphere. Pure water.
dialog: Temperate climate.
dialog: (TO COOPER)
dialog: You still think this is a coincidence?
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the tree line, less convinced.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Looks like we can climb up the
dialog: mountains back to the ice. We're
dialog: down to three suits. We'll have to
dialog: send someone ahead to get a fourth.
dialog: 81.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I won't need one.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Why not?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Because I'm not going anywhere.
dialog: This is our new home.
text: 
text: Brand picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and
text: hikes into the jungle.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper finishes constructing the modest shelter. They load
text: the suits and the rest of their gear inside.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Any sign of Brand?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: She's still taking samples. If you
dialog: find her, tell her to head back.
dialog: Night should be falling soon.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What happens then?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Your guess is as good as mine.
text: 
text: Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like life-
dialog: forms, which are wildly different from their counterparts
text: back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a
text: struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: This is incredible. The organisms
dialog: trapped in the ice above absorb x-
dialog: rays and emit light. In return,
dialog: these plants absorb the light and
dialog: emit oxygen, which feeds the animals
text: trapped in the ice.
text: 
text: Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The
text: transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto
text: the glass automatically. She compares it with the flecks
text: she collected in the ice above, fascinated.
dialog: 82.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at this. I think they're the
dialog: same organism at a different stage
dialog: of the life cycle.
dialog: (shows him the sample)
text: It's fractal. No individual cells --
dialog: the structure repeats all the way
dialog: down.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the sample, then continues scanning the jungle
text: around them, nervous.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Any sign of big life-forms?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: The soil's been disturbed. So
dialog: something's been moving. But I
dialog: haven't seen anything.
dialog: (notices his look)
dialog: Cooper... are you nervous?
text: 
text: Cooper stops scanning the trees, embarrassed.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I just think we should get back to
text: the shelter before night falls.
text: 
text: Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the
text: neutron star must have orbited out of view. Night is falling.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Relax. If there are any large
dialog: organisms here, even predatory ones,
dialog: they're not going to attack us --
dialog: they have no idea what we are.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You don't know that. You just have
dialog: blind faith this place is going to
dialog: be some kind of Eden.
text: 
text: Brand stops. He's struck a nerve.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (truly pissed off)
dialog: Faith has nothing to do with it.
dialog: You know what you are, Cooper? You're
dialog: just another in a long line of people
dialog: saying 'no.' That this isn't going
dialog: to work. And frankly, I don't have
dialog: to convince you.
dialog: 83.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: You're on this mission because you're
dialog: another pair of hands. You want the
dialog: truth? I told Case we should bring
dialog: another robot over you. At least
dialog: then I could just reprogram you to-
text: 
text: She stops. Something has caught her attention.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Nothing. I just -- I could have
dialog: sworn it just moved.
text: 
text: She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. Puts a
text: hand on it.
text: 
text: Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to
text: descend, more rapidly than on Earth.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze
text: over Brand's fingers.
text: 
text: Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her,
text: this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking
text: at the jungle around them, spooked.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You know how plants don't usually
dialog: move? Is that a universal rule?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: No. There really aren't any rules.
text: 
text: All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the
text: ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: (trying to stay calm)
dialog: Remember, we're the aliens.
text: 
text: Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop
text: onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold very still. Don't make any
text: sudden movements.
text: 
text: Two of the pieces join together, stacking themselves up and
text: staggering toward him.
dialog: 84.
text: 
text: A third piece climbs onto the first two, looking for a good
text: place to hang on. After a moment it hunkers down on top,
text: forming a crude head. Thirty eye-like structures blink open
text: on the creature.
text: 
text: The skin of the life-form begins to flicker with a dim light
text: like the animals trapped in the ice above, bathing Cooper
text: and Brand in a warm glow.
text: 
text: The creature creeps closer to them, taking them in. Cooper
text: tries his best to seem non-threatening.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Hello there.
text: 
text: The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head
text: splits open and it BELLOWS.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: OK. Now we run.
text: 
text: Brand doesn't argue. They turn and sprint through the trees.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle. At first,
text: they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind
text: them. But as they run, the entire jungle around them begins
dialog: to break apart and move.
text: 
text: After a moment, they're surrounded. The jungle is completely
text: disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each
text: one a different size and shape than the others.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We have to reach the shelter.
text: 
text: They head off, crashing through the melee.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Case, Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter
dialog: finishing the day's work.
text: 
text: Doyle turns around. The jungle is breaking apart and crawling
text: down the beach towards them.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I think we've got a problem.
text: 
text: Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed
text: as they move towards them.
text: 
text: Roth begins to step out towards them.
dialog: 85.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Fascinating. I think-
text: 
text: Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the
dialog: shelter after Doyle.
text: 
text: Case pushes the door closed.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
text: 
text: They crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING
text: at the walls, trying to force their way inside.
text: 
dialog: It's going to be a long night.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Ahead, Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea,
text: light still flickering in patches from the ice above it.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: This way.
text: 
text: Brand begins to follow.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: No... wait.
text: 
text: Too late. Cooper forces his way between two writhing
text: creatures, steps through, and falls...
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water. Brand
text: floats past.
text: 
text: The river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good
text: reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night.
text: 
text: Ahead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over
text: it in a torrent.
text: 
text: Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick
dialog: tree branch with one hand and, a second later, Brand with
text: the other as she slides past.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I've got you.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches
text: itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony
text: organism. It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again...
dialog: 86.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. POOL -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Brand surfaces first. She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and
text: out of the water. She smiles down at him, a little smug.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I've got you.
text: 
text: Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as
dialog: if imitating them.
text: 
text: Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward
text: into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CAVE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Brand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a
text: soft light.
text: 
text: As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of
text: the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble
text: down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal.
text: 
text: For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed.
text: Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps
text: its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows,
text: and another, until the cave entrance is full.
text: 
text: Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock.
text: Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his
text: hand and drops it back to the ground.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: It's game theory. The best move is
dialog: always to cooperate at first.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: By "cooperate" do you mean let it
dialog: eat me?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: These organisms have no interest in
dialog: us. They survive by photosynthesis.
dialog: All they need is light.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Then why are they killing each other?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (LOOKS AROUND)
dialog: But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So
dialog: unless you have a better idea, I
dialog: suggest we make nice.
dialog: 87.
text: 
text: The creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster.
text: 
text: Cooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around
text: him. Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a
dialog: better look at him.
text: 
text: One of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding
text: at his shoulders, then his neck.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (trying to be calm)
dialog: What is it doing?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: It's a colony organism. It's trying
dialog: to incorporate you into its structure.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I don't want it to incorporate me.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Don't open your mouth.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
speaker_heading: WHY N-
text: 
text: As he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly,
text: pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth.
text: 
text: Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his
text: teeth. Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete,
text: and it appears to be searching for the same texture on
text: Cooper's skin, without much luck.
text: 
text: Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The
text: last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower
text: body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After
text: a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.
text: 
text: Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he
dialog: and Brand are left alone again.
text: 
text: Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated,
text: as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: They're killing each other.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: No. They don't bleed... they don't
dialog: die... they're just competing...
dialog: trying out different shapes, looking
dialog: for the best one.
dialog: 88.
text: 
text: Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged
text: beast stumbles past and tackles another animal.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I'd say they have a long way to go.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (AMAZED)
dialog: They do this every night.
text: 
text: As they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw
text: scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and
text: smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and
text: adopting some of the writhing parts as its own.
text: 
text: Something about the movement is endearing, the way it
text: experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more
text: like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set.
text: 
text: Suddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front
text: of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to
text: scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings one
text: club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a moment,
text: it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one.
text: 
text: The new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily
text: snapping its new claw at larger opponents.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: The behavior changes as the animals
dialog: get bigger and bigger. More
text: sophisticated. More calculated.
text: 
text: Two of the larger organisms square off, circling each other,
text: lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: But what are they competing for?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I don't know.
text: 
text: Brand shivers -- it's getting colder.

scene_heading: INT. CAVE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've
dialog: brought with them.
text: 
text: Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her
text: case. It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying
dialog: to find a way out.
dialog: 89.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: These creatures are billions of years
dialog: older than we are. But they're
dialog: relatively primitive. They haven't
dialog: developed tools, culture, language.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Why not?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I don't know. No one knows how
dialog: intelligent life began on Earth.
dialog: But the surface of this planet has
dialog: virtually no craters. No impacts.
dialog: It's been sheltered by the local
text: black holes.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What difference would that make?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Maybe not enough has gone wrong here.
dialog: Maybe bad luck is the key to
dialog: intelligent life.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (QUIETLY)
dialog: Murph's Law.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Exactly. Maybe our interaction with
dialog: them will push them over the top.
dialog: Maybe that's part of the plan.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: The plan.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Why is it so hard for you to accept
dialog: that someone might be trying to help
dialog: us?
text: 
text: Cooper is silent for a moment. His mood darkens.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I was in Denver during the first
dialog: year of the famine. I was just a
dialog: kid. We kept waiting for someone to
dialog: come help us. People starved to
dialog: death sitting on the ground, waiting
dialog: for someone to come.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: 90.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: I only made it because I realized
dialog: that nobody was coming to save us.
dialog: We were on our own.
text: 
text: Cooper looks away. The memories are never that far away.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Honestly? After the things I saw...
dialog: you want to know why I don't believe
dialog: that someone would be trying to help
dialog: us? Because I'm not sure we're worth
dialog: saving.
text: 
text: They sit in silence for a while.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper sleeps. After a moment, Brand steps back out into
text: the darkness.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. PLAIN -- DAWN
text: 
text: Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the
text: temperature is well below freezing. The first flickers of
text: light are visible in the ice above.
text: 
text: The creatures are huge now, forty or fifty feet tall, battling
text: each other more and more slowly. As Brand watches, the
text: largest of them beats down his rivals, climbing to the top
text: of the heap.
text: 
text: Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck.
text: 
text: Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes
text: to catch the light. This is what the contest has been about --
dialog: a better place in the sun.
text: 
text: Brand takes it in.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage,
text: which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. Cooper
text: looks at the plants, wary.
text: 
text: Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: They're not going to move now, Cooper.
dialog: They need to spread themselves as
text: thin as they can to absorb the light.
dialog: 91.
text: 
text: Cooper leads the way, pushing through the trees.
text: 
text: Suddenly he stops again. Brand, annoyed, pushes through the
text: foliage to join him.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a-
text: 
text: She stops. Cooper is standing at a sheer cliff.
text: 
text: Spread out on the plain below is a massive, fortified base.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY
text: 
text: Massive blast doors, long since smashed in, open onto a
text: building that has been overrun by the local fractal wildlife.
text: 
text: Case steps inside first, his worklights flickering on. Cooper
text: and the others follow him in.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
text: 
text: The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has
text: covered the tables and chairs. Water pools on the floor and
text: light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals
text: have punched in the ceiling.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Looks like the Chinese picked a fight
dialog: with the locals.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Looks like they lost.
text: 
text: They continue through the ruins.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
text: 
text: The deeper they go, the less fractal wildlife they find.
text: The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds,
dialog: waiting for colonists who never came, like one of the bunkers
dialog: the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Look at the size of this place.
dialog: They built it for thousands of people.
dialog: But no one came.
text: 
text: Brand looks around, determined.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: They will. We can salvage it. This
dialog: place will save us years.
dialog: 92.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: But why didn't they come?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (SHRUGS)
dialog: The Chinese government collapsed,
dialog: same as ours. The people who knew
dialog: about this mission probably died
dialog: years ago. We had the same problems.
text: 
text: Roth finds a sign he likes the look of -- it points to the
dialog: science levels.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
text: 
text: A massive door GRINDS open and the team steps into a massive
text: complex of underground laboratories.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. DAMAGED LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab
text: that has been completely emptied -- no desks, no chairs,
text: nothing. The only thing that remains is a solid ball of
text: matter in the center of the room.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: What happened here?
text: 
text: Roth stares at the ball, intrigued.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: They were testing something.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Testing what?
text: 
text: Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built
text: from layers of different material. The outermost layer is
text: flattened steel.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: (LOOKING CLOSER)
dialog: Is that a chair?
text: 
text: Roth looks. The outermost layer of the ball indeed looks
text: like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto
text: surface of the ball.
text: 
text: Brand opens the door to the next lab.
dialog: 93.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
text: 
text: The lab is empty, except for a large metal sphere on a
text: pedestal in the center of the room. A black box is set into
text: a cavity in the sphere, wired to a control panel.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed
text: inwards, as if some great force had been pulling from the
text: center of the room.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
text: Everything in here is bolted down.
dialog: (looks at sphere)
dialog: What do you think this thing does?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: (EXCITED)
dialog: Let's find out.
text: 
text: Roth finds a control panel. Wipes off an inch of dust and
text: begins tinkering with the controls.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I wouldn't turn it on until we can
dialog: figure out what it does, Roth.
text: 
text: Roth continues to look over the controls, oblivious.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (O.S.)
dialog: Cooper. Come look at this.
text: 
text: Brand calls out from the hallway.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper follows Brand's voice down the stairs to a sub-basement
text: beneath the lab level.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper steps into a huge space filled with a near perfect
text: holographic representation of the local system.
text: 
text: Cooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map, looking at the
text: incredibly detailed models of each star.
text: 
text: Case is standing at a terminal, hacking into the camp's
dialog: records.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: I've found the Chinese mission logs.
dialog: They're encrypted.
text: 
text: Cooper walks over. Looks over the terminal.
dialog: 94.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Old military-grade encryption. It's
dialog: not very robust.
dialog: (looks at Case)
dialog: No offense. Hang on.
text: 
text: Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal. Opens up the
text: terminal. Scans the motherboard. Takes Case's rifle and
text: SMASHES one of the chips on the board.
text: 
text: The terminal comes to life. Cooper hands Case his rifle.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: That should open up most of it.
text: 
text: Case is silent for a beat, parsing the information.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: They got here twenty years ago. The
dialog: human crew was killed by radiation
dialog: the first day. But the robots
dialog: survived. They built the colony and
dialog: radioed home. But they didn't receive
text: a response.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: No one was listening.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: (SCANS DOCUMENT)
dialog: After a few years they discovered a
dialog: problem.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What problem?
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: It doesn't say. Their science team
dialog: took the ship to continue exploring
dialog: the system. It says they found some
dialog: kind of...
dialog: (TRANSLATING)
dialog: ...The word literally means
dialog: 'treasure.'
text: 
text: Case skims through the rest of the logs, large portions of
dialog: which have been redacted.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE (CONT'D)
dialog: The science team returned after five
dialog: years with a new technology. They
dialog: began the experiments upstairs, then
dialog: they left again and never returned.
dialog: 95.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Where did they go?
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: I don't know. They've deleted their
text: mission plan. There's nothing else.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I think I know what the problem is.
text: 
text: Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing
text: down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look.
text: 
text: Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a
text: blur, speeding in its orbit around Pantagruel.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
text: There's a small black hole moving
dialog: into the system. Too small for us
dialog: to have seen in our survey. It's
dialog: not going to hit the planet, but
dialog: it's going to come close.
text: 
text: A tiny black hole soars through the system. Although it
text: misses the ice planet, it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree.
text: After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to
text: Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn apart.
text: 
text: Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats --
dialog: the planet is pieced back together again and ejected, then
text: pulled back in and torn apart. Over and over.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: This place isn't paradise. It's
dialog: doomed. Just like us.
text: 
text: The crew stand, watching the sequence in stunned silence.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: How long does this place have?
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: A few years. A decade at most.
text: 
text: Doyle turns to Brand.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: So much for the plan.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at Brand. She is in disbelief, staring as a
text: lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces.
dialog: 96.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: But I don't understand... why are we
dialog: here? What are we here for?
text: 
text: Cooper looks down. Brand's upset is turning to anger.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell are we here for? I
dialog: trained my whole life to reach this
dialog: place.
text: 
text: She looks at Cooper, questioning.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (GENTLE)
dialog: Maybe... maybe Roth's right... maybe
dialog: we just don't understand it yet.
text: 
text: She looks down. She knows he doesn't believe what he's
text: saying. He's been right all along -- they're alone.
text: 
text: For a tiny moment, all hope is lost.
text: 
text: Suddenly, with a distant RUMBLE, the building begins SHAKING.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Case, what is that?
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: It's nighttime. The native life-
dialog: forms are mobile again.
text: 
text: The RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is
text: being gently shaken.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: No. It's closer than that.
dialog: (REALIZING)
dialog: Roth.
text: 
text: The RUMBLE grows. As Cooper watches, Case's rifle slides
text: free of the desk. But instead of falling, it simply hangs
dialog: in the air.
text: 
text: Then he realizes the same thing is happening to them -- his
text: boots no longer have traction with the ground. After a second
text: everything in the room is floating an inch off of the ground.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
text: Quick -- hold onto something.
text: 
text: He reaches out to Brand but it's too late -- suddenly they're
dialog: no longer floating, they're falling.
text: 
dialog: They're falling up.
dialog: 97.
text: 
text: Cooper, Brand and the rest of them hit the ceiling. Cooper
text: picks himself up and adjusts to his surroundings -- up is
text: now down. He helps Brand up.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What the hell is happening?
text: 
text: Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control
text: equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING
dialog: under a load it was never built to handle.
text: 
text: Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the
text: stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and
text: CRASHES towards them.
text: 
text: Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled
text: up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher
dialog: painting.
text: 
text: Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control
text: panel orbits past them back up towards the lab.
text: 
text: They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible,
text: dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards
dialog: the lab upstairs.
text: 
text: Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris
text: are SMASHING against the door to the lab.
text: 
text: Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips
text: and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab,
text: SMASHING it open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab.
text: 
text: Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. Brand reaches out for
dialog: him...
text: 
text: Too late. Cooper is pulled through the open door.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel.
text: He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel.
text: 
text: He dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand,
text: trying to get his bearings:
text: 
text: Roth, Doyle, and everything that hasn't been bolted down is
text: either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room
dialog: or is orbiting around it.
text: 
text: Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him:
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: The control panel is beneath you.
dialog: See if you can turn it off.
dialog: 98.
text: 
text: Cooper slips as he tries to reach the controls. Finally he
text: finds the controls for the machine.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (YELLS UP)
dialog: I found it. Hold onto something.
text: 
text: Roth and Doyle crawl up the side of the mass and hold onto
text: the support wires.
text: 
text: Cooper hits a key on the monitor.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the room inverts again, reverting to a normal
text: gravitational field. Cooper floats for a second, then topples
text: back to the ground, along with everything else.
text: 
text: Brand stumbles in to find Cooper sprawled on the floor as
text: Roth and Doyle hang onto the sphere for dear life.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Roth, back on terra firma, is looking at the tiny black box
text: he's pried from the center of the sphere. Cooper is looking
text: over his shoulder.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: They found a way to make gravity.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Not make it. Adjust it. Dial it
dialog: up, or down. I think they were
dialog: experimenting with it -- firing these
dialog: into the black hole to try to save
dialog: this planet.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: All that from one tiny box.
text: 
text: Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling
text: through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to
text: parse how it works. Cooper looks on.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: (AMAZED)
dialog: It barely uses any power. I'm only
dialog: beginning to understand what it does
dialog: but I think it sends a signal out
text: into the bulk. It must tap into the
dialog: same technologies that were used to
dialog: create the wormholes in the first
dialog: place.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: 99.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: It means whoever built the wormhole
dialog: probably doesn't exist inside our
dialog: universe.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the tiny box.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: But how did the Chinese develop the
dialog: technology? This would take decades,
dialog: maybe hundreds of years, to create.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Wherever they went, they found
dialog: something that allowed them to build
dialog: it.
text: 
text: Brand looks at the box.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: They came back here and tried to use
dialog: these devices to save this planet.
dialog: But they didn't work. Nothing would
dialog: be strong enough to weaken a black
dialog: hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Maybe we could work with it. Try to
dialog: improve it.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: No. You're missing the bigger
dialog: picture. The robots had strict
dialog: mission parameters. They were told
dialog: to build a colony and report back.
dialog: They tried to. But they failed.
dialog: Like us they were fixated on this
dialog: place.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at Brand.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH (CONT'D)
dialog: They didn't realize they had already
dialog: found something that would save us
dialog: all.
dialog: (holds up the box)
dialog: This. This is the prize.
text: 
text: He holds up the box.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't you see? Earth's gravity is
dialog: like a prison. But this is like a
text: master key.
dialog: (MORE)
dialog: 100.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH (CONT'D)
dialog: If we could build more of these, we
dialog: could turn down the earth's
dialog: gravitational field enough to save
dialog: millions of people. We wouldn't
dialog: have to pick a handful of people to
dialog: survive. With this we can save
dialog: everyone.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: And go where?
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Wherever we want. We don't belong
dialog: in any one place. Can't you see
dialog: that now? Not Earth. Not this place.
dialog: Nowhere. If the human race is going
dialog: to survive, we need to keep moving.
dialog: Split up. Spread out. Fly. With
dialog: this, we can.
text: 
text: Case looks at the box. Makes a decision.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: In the morning we're taking this and
dialog: going home.
text: 
text: Doyle, Roth and Case set about making preparations to leave --
dialog: gathering space suits, equipment.
text: 
text: In the bustle, Cooper finds Brand sitting alone, staring at
dialog: the sample of fractal life.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I know this isn't exactly what you
dialog: trained for. But I think Roth might
dialog: be right.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: That doesn't help this planet. This
dialog: creature is doomed. Unlike us it
dialog: doesn't have anywhere to go.
text: 
text: The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying
text: to comprehend. But it quickly loses interest and goes back
dialog: to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different
text: shapes, trying to escape. Brand sets it back down.
text: 
text: CUT TO:
text: 
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
text: 
text: Morning. Cooper and the others prepare to head out. They
text: are laden down with gear -- space suits for the return trip

dialog: 101.
text: 
dialog: Roth carries the gravitational prototype.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCE, CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY
text: 
text: They make their way through the ruined entrance.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: We need to hurry. We only have a
dialog: few hours to reach the ice before
dialog: nightfall.
text: 
text: Cooper stops. He puts a hand on Brand's shoulder. He points
text: to the tree line. Something is moving.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Don't make any sudden movements.
dialog: They can't hurt us if we're unarmed.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Who?
text: 
text: Suddenly, three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle, weapons
text: raised. They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together
text: from dried dead pieces of the local foliage.
text: 
text: Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. With
text: one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias.
text: 
text: Case steps protectively in front of his team.
text: 
text: The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward, rifle levelled.
text: 
speaker_heading: CHINESE OFFICER
dialog: Ni Hao. My name is Technical Sergeant
dialog: Liu, 177th reconnaissance Marines,

dialog: Welcome to New China.
dialog: (POLITE)
dialog: Please put down your weapon.
text: 
text: Sergeant Liu speaks in the same even tones as Case -- they
dialog: were probably built in the same factory before the war.
text: 
text: Case keeps his rifle raised.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: This is a scientific expedition, not
dialog: a military one. We are making our

text: 
speaker_heading: LIU
dialog: I'm afraid I cannot let you do that.
dialog: We will provide food and shelter and

speaker_heading: LIU (CONT'D)
dialog: We are sorry if this causes you any

speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: This planet is being pulled into the

text: 
speaker_heading: LIU
dialog: We will await further orders.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Further orders aren't coming. Your

dialog: money, same as ours. You're on your
dialog: own.
text: 
speaker_heading: LIU
dialog: We can offer you food and shelter as
dialog: long as you require. The facilities
dialog: here are quite comfortable.
text: 
text: Liu's tone remains polite, but there's no hope of changing

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (LOW)
dialog: They're never going to let us go.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (TO LIU)
dialog: Your mission is a humanitarian one,
dialog: wasn't it? You were sent to start a
dialog: colony. Like us.
text: 
speaker_heading: LIU
dialog: Our mission was to prepare for the
dialog: evacuation. This site was deemed
dialog: unacceptable.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: This device that you have built --
dialog: this could save millions of people.
dialog: We need to get it back home.
text:

speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Following? Following where?
text: 
text: Liu pauses.
text: 
speaker_heading: LIU
dialog: We will await further orders.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Your name means six. Where did the
dialog: others go? One through five? Is
dialog: that who were not supposed to follow.
text: 
text: Case turns to look at Cooper.
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: (LOW)
dialog: Take the others up to the lander.
dialog: Keep going. No matter what happens,
dialog: don't come back for me.
text: 
text: Cooper nods.
text: 
text: Case moves. Fast. He FIRES one shot at the nearest robot,
text: disabling it, then hurls himself at the remaining two,
text: tackling them both over the edge of the ravine.
text: 
text: Cooper watches them disappear into the void below. Grabs
dialog: Brand and the others.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Come on.
text: 
text: Cooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins
dialog: hiking up the mountain.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK -- DAY
text: 
text: The crew hike towards the ice above.
text: 
text: Below they hear a metallic BOOM as something heavy hits
text: something else -- Case is still fighting. They keep moving.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. UPPER MOUNTAIN PEAK -- TWILIGHT
text: 
text: They are high above the Marine camp, only fifty feet or so
text: below the massive ice roof of the cavern. The Chinese have
dialog: blasted a tunnel into the ice leading back up to the camp
text: above.
dialog: 104.
text: 
text: This high, the air is bitterly cold. Cooper and the others
text: are hunkered down, trying to keep warm, waiting for night to
dialog: fall so that they can climb back up to the lander without
dialog: being cooked by the neutron star.
text: 
text: Finally, above them, the light begins to flicker out. The
text: crew begin pulling on their space suits.
text: 
text: Brand checks on the fractal wildlife in the sample case --
text: she is bringing it with them. Cooper catches her eye.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: We can't leave them all to die.
text: 
text: She hefts the case and they begin climbing up into the ice.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Brand leads the way, the lights from her suit cutting into
text: the drifts of snow as they make their way slowly back to the
dialog: lander.
text: 
text: As they reach the lander Cooper spots lights emerging from
text: the ship. He raises Case's weapon.
text: 
text: One of Liu's marines steps around from the back of the lander.
text: Cooper FIRES.
text: 
text: The marine collapses.
text: 
text: Cooper and the others race to the lander.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Was that the last of them?
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: We're not going to stick around to
dialog: count them. Let's get out of here.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We're too late.
text: 
text: Cooper points to a damaged section of the ship's hull -- the
text: marine has torn open a section, revealing damaged hardware.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: The main thruster fuel supply. We're
dialog: not going anywhere.
text: 
text: Cooper looks down. They're stuck here.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What about the escape rocket at the
dialog: Chinese base camp? One of us could
dialog: fit into it.
dialog: 105.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: It doesn't matter how many of us
dialog: make it. We have to get this back
dialog: to earth.
text: 
text: Roth looks at the moons orbiting overhead.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Can the secondary thrusters still
dialog: fire on the lander?
text: 
text: Doyle looks over the craft.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Sure. But we don't have nearly enough
dialog: power for lift off.
text: 
text: Roth holds up the small gravity black box.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: Yes we do.
text: 
text: Roth sets off running towards the Chinese base camp.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper drags the pieces of the escape rocket out from the
text: shelter. Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the pieces
text: up and they snap together, forming a crude two-stage rocket
dialog: designed more for a robot than a man.
text: 
text: When it's complete Roth wedges himself inside, clutching the
text: black box -- he barely fits.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: I can reach one of the moons in low
dialog: orbit and turn up its gravity. As
dialog: it passes overhead it should be able
text: to slingshot the lander away from
text: the planet's surface.
dialog: (LOOKS AROUND)
dialog: Along with everything else.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: But we need to take the box back to
dialog: earth.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: You don't need this -- only the idea.
dialog: The knowledge of how to build it.
text: 
text: Cooper remembers something. Heads back into the shelter.
dialog: 106.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Roth follows Cooper into the lab.
text: 
text: Cooper opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at
text: random. Sets it down on the bench next to Roth.
text: 
text: Cooper begins rigging up a connection between the two.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I'm going to image the operating
dialog: code and the architecture onto the
text: probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled,
dialog: but it should give you and me enough
dialog: to rebuild it when we get back.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Not me. But you'll make it work.
text: 
text: The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the probe, and
text: takes the black box himself.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a one-way trip for me.
text: 
text: Before Cooper can respond, Roth heads for the door.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Roth squeezes himself into the rocket, hugging the black box
text: to his chest. Cooper and Brand help him.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: This isn't right, Roth. We can find
dialog: a way for all of us to leave.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: This is the only way. Keep the lander
dialog: upright and fire the secondary
dialog: boosters when the moon passes
text: overhead.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Let me take it.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: No. You need to make it home. You're
dialog: going to need to build more of these.
text: 
text: Brand looks at him, heartbroken. Roth smiles.
dialog: 107.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH (CONT'D)
dialog: I understand the plan, now. Whatever
dialog: happens, you have to keep exploring.
dialog: Keep learning. One good idea isn't
dialog: enough. You'll need more and more
dialog: of them just to survive. Do you
dialog: understand?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (NODS)
dialog: Thank you.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROTH
dialog: Go.
text: 
text: Brand turns to follow Cooper back.
text: 
text: Behind her, Roth's rocket LAUNCHES on an explosive cloud.
text: In seconds it's high overhead.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper checks over the hull, which is intact. Doyle is inside
text: looking over the controls. He steps back outside.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
text: Control systems inside are online.
dialog: (LOOKS UP)
dialog: I've lost sight of the rocket. Do
dialog: you think he made it?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We're going to find out soon enough.
text: 
text: Brand is looking off into the distance.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Someone's coming.
text: 
text: Cooper looks up. A robotlike figure is limping through the
text: snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle.
text: 
text: Finally he makes out the insignia -- it's Case.
text: 
text: Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as he
text: collapses in the snow. He's badly injured -- one leg torn
text: off at the knee, one arm mangled.
text: 
text: Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LANDER -- NIGHT
text: 
text: They drag Case into the lander. Doyle checks over the ship's
text: controls.
dialog: 108.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
text: Close the door.
text: 
text: Cooper moves to the door. Something's wrong.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Where's Brand?
text: 
text: She's nowhere to be seen. Cooper looks out onto the ice.
text: Brand is heading back out into the snow.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Dammit. If I don't make it back,
dialog: just keep going.
dialog: (points to probe)
dialog: Get that thing home.
text: 
text: Cooper steps to the door.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET
text: 
text: The rocket tucks in close behind one of the moons orbiting
dialog: the ice planet.
text: 
text: The rocket fires to maneuver closer and closer to the moon's
text: surface -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to
dialog: attract it.
text: 
text: When the rocket is close enough, Roth detonates the explosive
text: bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon's surface.
text: 
text: He scrambles to grab hold of the craggy surface. Behind
text: him, the rocket smashes apart against the surface.
text: 
text: Roth finally gets a good hold. He looks down.
text: 
text: Below him, the view is incredible -- the ice planet curving
text: into the distance, Gargantua rising over its horizon.
text: 
text: Roth looks at the black box in his hands.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Brand is a hundred yards from the lander by the time Cooper
text: catches up with her. She is digging in the snow.
text: 
text: He takes her arm but she won't go.
text: 
text: She finally finds what she's looking for -- the sample case.
text: The tiny fractal life-form is huddled at the bottom.
text: 
text: Cooper shakes his head and turns back to the lander.
dialog: 109.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
text: 
text: Roth is watching the ice planet pass by beneath him. He
text: finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it
text: punctures the ice near the Chinese camp.
text: 
text: For a moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of
text: Gargantua rising over the horizon of the shining ice planet.
text: 
text: He takes a final breath and activates the black box.
text: 
text: Instantly, the moon's gravity is magnified a hundred million
text: times over. Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses
text: around him into a tiny sphere.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper and Brand are only thirty yards or so from the lander.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the ground beneath them begins to RUMBLE.
text: 
text: Cooper turns back. A mile back the ground begins to tear
text: apart, heaving massive chunks of ice and rock into the sky.
text: 
text: Roth's moon is racing overhead, TEARING up a massive strip
text: of the surface's planet as it nears them.
text: 
dialog: Cooper and Brand run.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
text: 
text: The energy being unleashed by the tiny box is incredible --
dialog: millions of times more powerful than an atomic bomb.
text: 
text: The spray of debris is forming a rooster tail behind the
text: moon, rocketing up from the planet's surface.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. LANDER, SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper has almost made it back to the lander. Behind him,
text: Brand stumbles. He turns back.
text: 
text: Brand is pulling herself up. Behind her, the THUNDEROUS
text: EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet's surface is hurled into
dialog: space have almost reached them.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the ship. He'll never make it if he waits
text: for Brand. He turns back to find her.
text: 
text: He reaches Brand just as the moon's gravity hits them --
text: they're hurtled off into space. He grabs her hand.
text: 
text: Seconds later, everything -- the entire ice sheet, the sea
text: and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them.
dialog: 110.
text: 
text: Brand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin
dialog: atmosphere.
text: 
text: Brand looks at him.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (RADIO)
dialog: You caught me. Now what?
text: 
text: Cooper looks around. They planet's surface is breaking into
text: pieces around them.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (RADIO)
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (RADIO)
dialog: I figured if you were floating out
dialog: into space, you'd want some company.
text: 
text: He holds onto her as they fall up and out of the last of the
text: planet's thin atmosphere and the blackness embraces them.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Between you and utter solitude,
dialog: Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure.
text: 
text: They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the
text: planet begins to win out. For a moment they float.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Guess you were right -- too much
dialog: gravity, or not enough.
text: 
text: He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They
text: stare into each other's eyes.
text: 
text: Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice
dialog: planet.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock
text: opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm.
text: 
text: Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LANDER
text: 
text: Cooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards.
text: 
text: Doyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending
text: into space as the debris around them begins crashing back
text: down towards the ice planet.
text: 
text: Cooper looks out the window:
dialog: 111.
text: 
text: The moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's
text: surface as it circles out of view.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Roth.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: He's gone.
text: 
text: Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Brand, Cooper, and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock
text: and scramble to take control of the ship.
text: 
text: Below them, the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the
text: neutron star's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of
dialog: Pantagruel.
text: 
text: Doyle finally gets the ship straightened out. Its sole
text: remaining engine FIRES, rocketing the ship back towards the
text: dark side of the planet, out of view of the neutron star,
text: and back towards the original wormhole.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I'm setting a course for the wormhole.
text: 
dialog: They're going to make it.
text: 
text: Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny
text: awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Cooper props Case up against the workbench. He pulls down
text: replacement arms and legs from storage bins. Unwraps them
text: from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto
dialog: Case's chassis.
text: 
text: Cooper finishes attaching the arm. Case rotates it, checking
dialog: the function.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: How is that working?
text: 
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: Very well, thank you.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Good. We've already set the course,
dialog: skipper. We're going home.
text: 
text: Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level.
dialog: 112.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL
text: 
text: Doyle is setting the controls. The ALARMS on the controls
text: have finally abated -- they're out of the danger zone.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: We're safe now.
text: 
text: Cooper heads to the communications equipment.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Now I know why we weren't able to
text: hit the relay. It's not interference --
dialog: the blue-shift from the black hole
dialog: is more than we thought it would be.
text: 
text: Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (CONFLICTED)
dialog: Cooper, wait--
text: 
text: The ship PINGS the relay on the far side of the wormhole.
text: 
text: There is no response.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: (THINKS)
dialog: Wait. The ship cached one long
dialog: garbled transmission when we first
dialog: fell into the swirl. If we account
dialog: for the blue shift then the computer
dialog: might find something in there.
text: 
text: Cooper brings up the last garbled transmission they received.
text: The computer begins re-analyzing it, piece by piece.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (QUIET)
dialog: Listen to me -- the blueshift also
dialog: means we've lost time. More time
dialog: than we thought we would.
text: 
text: Cooper looks up at her.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: How much?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if
dialog: WE DON'T-
text: 
text: The comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet. Then
dialog: another.
dialog: 113.
text: 
text: Then a FLOOD of communications, one packet a day, hundreds
text: and hundreds of packets: images, videos, audio messages from
dialog: family and friends.
text: 
text: Cooper watches, horrified, as the images play out across the
text: screen. He is watching the lives of his family play out at
text: light speed. Finally, the packets slow, then stop.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the results, in shock.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Forty seven years.
text: 
text: Doyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: My kids...
text: 
text: Cooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (GENTLE)
dialog: The relay will have lost power years
dialog: ago. That's why we couldn't contact
dialog: it, even after we reached the planet.
text: 
text: Cooper is still problem solving, thinking.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We could bypass the relay. Send a
dialog: conventional shortwave signal.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Only a tiny portion of the signal
dialog: would make it though the wormhole.
dialog: Besides, no one will be listening
dialog: anymore.
text: 
text: The comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You knew, didn't you? You and Case
dialog: figured it out when we landed.
text: 
text: Brand looks down.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I thought... I couldn't be sure.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Sure you could. You're brilliant.
dialog: You know everything.
dialog: 114.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Cooper... we needed to keep going.
dialog: I'm so sorry. Your children...
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: They're not children any more... if
dialog: they're even still alive.
text: 
text: He turns away from her.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Listen, the important thing is that
dialog: we're going home, now. And we have
dialog: something that can save everyone.
dialog: It's more important than the people
dialog: we left behind-
text: 
text: Doyle cuts her off, filled with anger.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: That's easy for you to say. You
dialog: didn't leave anyone behind.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Yes she did.
text: 
text: Brand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: That's why you were upset -- your
dialog: father.
text: 
text: She looks down, filled with sadness.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: He's gone. But there are other people
dialog: who still need our help. There's
dialog: still time...
text: 
text: The ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn:
text: 
text: Case is standing at the controls.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Case... what are you doing?
text: 
text: Case finishes typing in a sequence on the command controls.
text: Presses the "execute" button.
text: 
text: The last nuclear engine begins to detach from the ship.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait... no...
dialog: 115.
text: 
text: The robot turns from them. Cooper notices that the control
text: module snapped into the back of Case's chassis is wrong:
text: 
text: It's red with a gold star. It's not Case at all. It's Liu.
text: 
speaker_heading: LIU
dialog: I'm sorry. I have my orders. No
dialog: one follows...
text: 
text: Liu stares, satisfied, as the nuclear engine spins away from
text: the ship and back down toward Pantagruel.
text: 
text: Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles to the
text: ground, the fight gone out of him.
text: 
text: Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for
text: his control module.
text: 
speaker_heading: LIU (CONT'D)
text: No one follows-
text: 
text: Cooper rips the module out. The robot freezes.
text: 
text: Brand is already at the controls, trying to regain control.
text: 
text: The instruments TONE, alerting the crew to their position:
text: 
text: The ship is spinning back down towards the black hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: No... We're being pulled back to
dialog: Pantagruel.
text: 
text: Cooper, frantically checks the controls, firing the remaining
dialog: boosters.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We can't let that happen. We'll
dialog: lose more time... too much...
text: 
text: The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black
text: hole below them.
text: 
text: On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship
text: climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit.
text: 
text: As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the
text: bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks --
text: time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the
text: deep gravity well around the hole.
text: 
text: As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the
text: system above them. They watch as the ice planet whirls around
text: them, orbiting the black hole dozens of times.
dialog: 116.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: We're losing years.
text: 
text: Finally, the ice planet plunges past them towards destruction.
text: As it reaches it slows, until finally it reaches the event
text: horizon, just as they saw in the projections. Nothing has
dialog: prepared them for the reality:
text: 
text: The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence.
text: 
text: Brand looks at the sample of fractal life. Now they are
dialog: united -- they are, in all likelihood, the sole survivors of
dialog: their planet.
text: 
text: Doyle points to the instruments.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: The wormhole. Look -- it's being
text: pulled into the black hole as well.
text: 
text: They watch on the holographic model as the wormhole's orbit
text: converges on the event horizon of the black hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
text: It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What will happen to it?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: It'll be destroyed, like everything
dialog: else.
text: 
text: Cooper struggles to pull himself over to the communications
text: screen. Sets it to make a shortwave broadcast. Brand opens
text: her mouth to point out that it's futile, then stops.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (INTO RADIO)
dialog: This is the crew of the Endurance.
dialog: We...
dialog: (gives up on
dialog: FORMALITIES)
dialog: Murph, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't
dialog: make it back, like I promised.
text: 
text: He hangs up the radio.
text: 
text: In silence, they watch as the wormhole -- their only way
text: home -- vanishes beneath the event horizon.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: How much time are we losing?
dialog: 117.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (HEARTBROKEN)
dialog: Decades...hundreds of years.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: All of those people back home...
dialog: none of them will make it.
text: 
text: As Doyle watches the controls the ship continues to spiral
text: towards the black hole.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: This is it. We're going to be pulled
dialog: in.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the controls, an idea forming.
text: 
text: He pulls himself down. Hauls himself across the deck to
text: pick up Liu's chip. He plugs it into a diagnostic tool.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: What are you doing?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Case said the Chinese found something
dialog: else. The location was scrubbed
dialog: from their records. But I bet he
dialog: knows it.
text: 
text: Cooper fires up the chip. Begins sorting through the onboard
dialog: memory.
text: 
text: Doyle watches the instruments.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Hurry up.
text: 
text: Cooper concentrates, poring over the numbers. Finally he
text: begins feeding coordinates into the navigation computer.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Here. Can we reach it?
text: 
text: Brand looks at the map. The point appears on the far side
text: of Gargantua. Brand studies the trajectory.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: We can use the thrusters to keep us
dialog: on the critical orbit. Then slingshot
dialog: us towards Gargantua.
text: 
text: The thrusters STRAIN to push the ship back up towards the
dialog: critical orbit.
dialog: 118.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the tidal gravity SLAMS them against the walls of
text: the ship.
text: 
text: Finally, the thrusters fire again -- a tiny push, but just
text: enough to launch the ship clear of the black hole, like a
text: rock out of a slingshot.
text: 
text: The ship races toward the massive hole in the sky below them:
text: 
speaker_heading: GARGANTUA
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA
text: 
text: The ship picks up more and more speed as it soars closer to
text: the massive black hole's event horizon.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: The sky closes to a tiny hole above them. Gargantua is
text: swallowing their view.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the radar, which is choked with debris.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: We only have a few minutes before
dialog: we're swallowed into that thing.
dialog: What are we even looking for?
text: 
text: On the radar, a tiny empty spot appears.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (points to screen)
dialog: That? What is it?
text: 
text: Brand looks. In one tiny region on the back side of the
text: black hole, the debris simply seems to vanish.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: It's another wormhole.
text: 
text: Doyle FIRES the thrusters again, pushing the ship towards
dialog: the wormhole.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA
text: 
text: The Endurance spins, shifting paths slightly as it continues
text: to race closer and closer to oblivion.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: They study the controls. The projected path shifts, one
text: degree at a time. Finally, it appears to put them on a path
dialog: to hit the wormhole.
text: 
text: Doyle shuts off the thrusters.
dialog: 119.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: We're not going to be able to slow
text: down. Hold onto something.
text: 
text: He locks up the controls.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA -- MORNING
text: 
text: The ship is tumbling through space, racing toward the second
text: wormhole. It is massive, much larger than the first wormhole,
text: and it's glowing with a light as bright as a star.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: The crew brace themselves against the hull of the ship.
text: 
text: Suddenly the ship slams onto the wormhole mouth and is pulled
text: violently into the wormhole.
text: 
text: WHITENESS.
text: 
text: As the light fades, Cooper and the others come to.
text: 
text: The light is rapidly dimming from pure white, fading to a
text: deep red, then infrared, finally darkness.
text: 
text: Cooper looks out. Checks the instruments. Looks out again.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. VACUUM
text: 
text: Nothing. Blackness as far as the eye can see. No stars.
text: No planets. Just inky darkness stretching on forever.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Brand joins Cooper on the deck. Together, they look out at
text: the blackness that surrounds them.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Where are we?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I don't know. It's like we entered
dialog: the wormhole and never left it.
text: 
text: Brand checks the instruments. There is nothing for the ship
dialog: to model.
text: 
text: There is nowhere to go. They drift.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Days go by. They check the instruments. Still nothing.
text: It's as if they have left the known universe altogether.
dialog: 120.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Doyle sits down. After a moment, he turns on the screen and
text: cues up a message.
text: 
text: His children appear on-screen, giggling, pushing each other,
text: trying to get a prime spot in front of the camera.
text: 
text: Doyle cups his face in his hands and cries.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Cooper above his bunk, stares out into the blackness.
text: 
text: Brand watches him from the doorway.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I'm sorry. I should have told you.
dialog: I didn't have the right.
dialog: (BEAT)
dialog: But you should watch the recordings.
dialog: You should know what happened to
dialog: your kids.
text: 
text: Cooper ignores her.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Brand watches her father talking to her on-screen. He is
text: twenty years older than when she left him.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND'S FATHER
dialog: I'm not going to make it much longer.
dialog: The machines will continue to maintain
dialog: the station as long as they can and
dialog: the communications will run as long
dialog: as the station here still has power.
dialog: I'm sorry. I hope wherever you are,
dialog: darling, you're safe.
text: 
text: The screen cuts out. Brand watches the static play out.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Doyle sits at the table. He has found a flair gun in one of
text: the ditch kits. It is sitting on the table in front of him.
text: The message is clear.
text: 
text: Brand sits down across from him.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Our last trip past the black hole
dialog: cost us another 100, maybe 200 years.
dialog: Which means there's a good chance
dialog: we're the only humans alive anywhere.
dialog: 121.
text: 
text: She stands up.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: I think the last human beings should
dialog: have a little more fight in them
dialog: than that.
text: 
text: Brand picks up the sample of fractal life and places it under
text: a lamp on the counter. It freezes, absorbing the rays.
text: 
text: Doyle looks at the gun.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM
text: 
text: Cooper, in a space suit, steps out of the airlock.
text: 
text: He drifts out from the ship.
text: 
text: Nothing. Behind him, the ship is a tiny speck in an ocean
text: of darkness.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Cooper sits down. Turns on the screen.
text: 
text: After a moment, the camera turns on. Tom, his eldest son,
text: still 15 years old, turns on the camera.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hi, Dad.
text: 
text: Cooper pauses it. He can't take it. After a moment, he
dialog: lets it run again.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: I met another girl, Dad. I really
dialog: think this is the one.
text: 
text: Tom holds up a picture of himself and a teenage GIRL.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Murph stole Grandpa's car. He crashed
dialog: it. He's OK, though. No broken
dialog: bones.
text: 
text: Cooper leans back.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Cooper is holed up, still watching, several days' growth of
text: beard unshaved. He's been watching for days.
text: 
text: On the screen, Tom is a grown man in his 20s.
dialog: 122.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I've got a surprise for you, Dad.
dialog: You're a grandpa.
text: 
text: Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling. The kid
text: is BAWLING.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Congratulations. Grandpa said he
dialog: already earned the "great" bit so we
dialog: just leave it at that.
text: 
text: The screen cuts out.
text: 
text: The next message begins. Tom is in his 30s.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi, Dad. I'm sorry it's been awhile.
text: 
text: He stops, emotional.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Grandpa died last week. We buried
dialog: him out in the back forty, next to
dialog: Mom.
dialog: (LOOKS DOWN)
dialog: Where we'd have buried you, if you'd
dialog: ever come back.
text: 
text: He laughs, gallows humor.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Murph was there for the funeral.
dialog: It's been a few years since I've
dialog: seen him. He's been down in the
dialog: Gulf Coast. He's an engineer. I
dialog: guess someone followed in your
dialog: footsteps after all.
text: 
text: Tom looks down.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not listening to this. I
dialog: know that. All of these messages
dialog: are just out there, drifting in the
text: darkness.
text: 
text: He stops for a second.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: You're gone. You're never coming
dialog: back. And I've known that for a
dialog: long time. Lois says -- that's my
dialog: wife, Dad -- she says I have to let
dialog: you go. So I am.
dialog: 123.
text: 
text: He reaches up to turn off the camera.
text: 
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Wherever you are, I hope you're at
dialog: peace. Goodbye, Dad.
text: 
text: The image freezes, Tom's hand on the camera, then breaks
text: apart into digital noise.
text: 
dialog: Then nothing.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at it for a second. Then rises to leave.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the screen flickers to life again.
text: 
text: A good-looking man in his late 30s turns on a camera. Cooper
text: recognizes him instantly. It's Murph.
text: 
text: Murph looks at the camera for a long beat, clearly unsure
dialog: about this.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH
dialog: Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.
text: 
text: He laughs, self-conscious.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH (CONT'D)
dialog: It's your 60th birthday today.
dialog: Thought I would celebrate with you a
dialog: bit.
dialog: (BEAT)
dialog: I guess I understand why you left.
dialog: The corn is dying now, too.
dialog: Tom says there's less and less at
dialog: harvest every year.
text: 
text: He pauses. Lifts up his hand and scratches his stubble.
text: 
text: Cooper pauses the message. He looks carefully at the screen:
text: 
text: Murph is wearing his dad's watch.
text: 
text: Cooper lets the message play. Tears are streaming down his
text: face.
text: 
speaker_heading: MURPH (CONT'D)
dialog: Rot's setting in. I guess you were
dialog: right for clearing out while you had
dialog: the chance.
dialog: (reaches up to switch
dialog: OFF CAMERA)
dialog: Good luck, old man. I hope you made
dialog: it. I really do.
text: 
text: The video cuts out.
dialog: 124.
text: 
text: A message appears on the screen:
text: 
text: "Final transmission." Relay powered down 05232087
text: 
text: Cooper turns off the screen.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Cooper is seated, alone. Almost every compartment has been
text: opened and emptied -- debris is swirling through the
dialog: compartment.
text: 
text: Brand walks in. They sit in silence for a moment. When
text: Cooper speaks, it's clear his sadness has faded to a gallows
dialog: humor.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Not a single drink on the whole ship.
dialog: What kind of mission is this?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I think Doyle's been experimenting
text: with the coolant from his spacesuit.
text: 
text: They sit in silence for a moment.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You really think we're the last humans
dialog: alive anywhere?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I don't know. Maybe.
dialog: (looks him in the eye)
dialog: Yes.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: So that's it, then? That's all?
text: 
text: He looks down, saddened by his own words.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: (QUIET)
dialog: It's happened a billion times over.
text: Stars explode. The pieces drift in
text: space. Gravity pulls them back
dialog: together. They form new stars.
dialog: Then planets. Then us. We die. It
dialog: starts all over again.
text: 
text: Cooper shakes his head.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What about the plan? The grand
dialog: scheme.
dialog: 125.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I thought you didn't believe in one.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I didn't. But you were bringing me
dialog: round.
text: 
text: He laughs, his anger coming and going in waves.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell was the point? What
dialog: did it add up to?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I don't know. Maybe it just adds up
dialog: to this.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: This? You're saying the end result
dialog: of ten billion years is the atoms
dialog: from dead stars standing here
dialog: disagreeing with each other.
text: 
text: She smiles at him. Bittersweet.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Maybe that's enough.
text: 
text: He turns away from her. She takes his shoulder.
text: 
text: She pulls him into a kiss. His surprise disappears and he
text: pulls her to him, kissing her back.
text: 
text: Their surroundings forgotten, they drift. She LAUGHS gently
text: as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending
text: them spinning back into the center of the cabin.
text: 
text: She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In moments,
text: the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors
text: and shapes, like a ticker tape parade.
text: 
text: In the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE -- LATER
text: 
text: Cooper and Brand embrace, sleeping, drifting in the cabin.
text: 
text: Suddenly, Doyle's voice calls out from the other cabin.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (O.S.)
dialog: It's happening... it's happening
dialog: again... Get up here...
text: 
text: Cooper wakes, careful not to disturb Brand. He plucks his
text: shirt from the floating laundry pile and pulls it on.
dialog: 126.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
text: 
text: Cooper hauls himself up into the upper cabin. Doyle is
text: standing in the middle of the chamber.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: They just appeared.
text: 
text: A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the
text: first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a
text: point in the middle of the cabin.
text: 
text: Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in
text: response.
text: 
text: Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points
text: appear, as if they've been summoned by the first.
text: 
dialog: Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of
text: them are motionless.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I think these are the creatures that
dialog: built the wormhole.
text: 
text: One of them begins to move closer to Cooper.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: This thing is made of... gravity?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: No. I don't think it's in our
dialog: universe at all. I think it lives
dialog: in the bulk -- the space that the
dialog: wormholes traverse. And it can only
dialog: interact with us using gravity.
text: 
text: The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the
text: space it's in, stretching the skin.
text: 
text: Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body,
text: coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso
text: like a fun house mirror.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins
text: moving, tugging him gently through the cabin.
text: 
text: In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled
text: through the cabin.
text: 
text: It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between
text: creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall.
text: 
text: Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled
text: around the room.
dialog: 127.
text: 
text: Cooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the
text: bulk beings move them through space. They hold onto each
text: other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the
text: whirling dance continues.
text: 
text: Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a
text: tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. The creature breaks
text: apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure.
text: 
text: Finally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself
text: around the lab, looking for some way to try to communicate
dialog: with the creatures.
text: 
text: She finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves
text: them close to each other, then far apart.
text: 
text: The bulk beings soon join her, mimicking the motion of the
text: pieces of equipment.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Can we communicate with them?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Where would we even start? Maybe--
text: 
text: She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and
text: tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining
text: globes into the air.
text: 
text: For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin
text: moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them
text: into patterns in the air.
text: 
text: First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then
text: shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around
dialog: a medium-sized star.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: That's our solar system.
text: 
text: After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and
text: rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua,
dialog: Pantagruel, and the ice planet.
text: 
text: Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet.
text: Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around
text: the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an
text: umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: What is that?
text: 
text: Brand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its
dialog: universe.
dialog: 128.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: That's us. That's where they've
dialog: brought us. We're in the bulk.
text: 
text: Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static
dialog: now.
text: 
text: Cooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The
text: instruments on the ship TONE in alarm.
text: 
text: Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings
text: scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is
text: moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: They're moving us.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Where?
text: 
text: They stand, looking out into the perfect darkness.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM
text: 
text: The ship begins to close in on something in the darkness: a
text: tiny point of light.
text: 
text: As they grow closer, they realize that it's an opening.
text: They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been
dialog: the entire time.
text: 
text: The ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of
text: the sphere.
text: 
text: Below them is an astonishing sight:
text: 
dialog: Our entire universe, compressed into a flattened disc, like
text: a floor of stars. They are hovering above it, in the bulk,
dialog: the space between universes.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. ENDURANCE, BULK
text: 
text: Brand and the others stare at the incredible display.
text: 
text: The ship drops down and begins to orbit around the massive
dialog: hollow sphere between them and our universe, lower and lower
text: until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere.
text: 
text: In the distance, they can make out a cluster of lights.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: There's something out there.
text: 
text: The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer:
dialog: 129.
text: 
text: It's a massive space station, built onto the surface of the
dialog: sphere.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE STATION
text: 
text: The Endurance glides to a gentle stop on one of the upper
text: decks of the space station.
text: 
text: After a moment, the airlock to the ship opens and Cooper and
text: the others step out, in their suits.
text: 
text: They walk up to the airlock doors of the station, which open
dialog: automatically.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. SPACE STATION
text: 
text: After the airlock decompresses, the inner doors open.
text: Standing there, waiting for them, is a familiar figure:
text: 
dialog: Tars.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: (DEADPAN)
dialog: I guess this isn't robot heaven after
dialog: all.
text: 
text: The light on his brow glows and he offers them both a hand.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. GRAND LABORATORY, SPACE STATION
text: 
text: The humans have taken off their space suits -- the station
dialog: has been built to be habitable by humans -- and are following
text: Tars through the massive facility.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: I orbited the black hole seven times
dialog: before I hit the second wormhole.
dialog: Then I drifted until I found this
dialog: place.
text: 
text: Cooper looks around. The halls are filled with countless
dialog: technological wonders.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: This is what the Chinese were
dialog: protecting.
dialog: (LOOKS AROUND)
dialog: How they could have built all this
dialog: in just a handful of years.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: They didn't. It took them four
dialog: thousand.
dialog: (off Brand's look)
dialog: Time moves very slowly here
dialog: 130.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: How do you know?
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: Because I've been waiting for you
dialog: for three hundred years.
text: 
text: Brand looks around at the massive facility.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Time. That's what the bulk beings
dialog: wanted to give us. That was the
dialog: treasure the Chinese found. Enough
dialog: time to let us save ourselves.
text: 
text: Brand looks around. The facility is massive. She sets the
text: specimen case down on a table. Even the tiny creature seems
text: in awe of the place.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY, SPACE STATION
text: 
text: Tars shows them a prototype for the gravity machine. It is
dialog: tiny -- increasing G around two spheres that attract each
text: other with a tiny force.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: I have catalogued almost everything
dialog: they had built here.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Must have taken you a while.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: One hundred and fifty-seven years.
text: 
text: Cooper shakes his head in disbelief.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: How are they keeping the lights on
dialog: in this thing?
text: 
text: Tars, in answer, points to a far door.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: Follow me.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. ENGINE ROOM, SPACE STATION
text: 
text: A massive reinforced-concrete shell shudders with the energy
text: contained within it. The whole room HUMS with power.
text: 
text: Tars pulls up a display showing the inside of the shell:
text: 
text: A tiny black hole spins, spewing out massive amounts of power.
dialog: 131.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: It's a mini black hole. A remnant
dialog: of the big bang. It will power this
dialog: place forever.
text: 
text: Tars leads them on.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION
text: 
text: Tars leads them past an incredibly sleek fleet of spacecraft.
text: Cooper starts to stop, but Tars doesn't slow down.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. SIMULATION ROOM
text: 
text: In the center of the room is a giant holographic globe of
text: the Earth, perfect down to the tiniest detail.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: It's a map?
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: No. Not a map. This is a simulation
text: of the Earth. A perfect simulation.
text: 
text: Tars touches the control panel. The map zooms in over Europe.
text: Down onto Paris. Late 20th century:
text: 
text: People walk through the streets. A woman stops at a newsagent
dialog: to buy a newspaper.
text: 
text: Tars touches the controls again and the map zooms out.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS (CONT'D)
dialog: They tested each of the technologies
dialog: hundreds of times, trying to find
dialog: the one that would cause the least
dialog: damage and still allow us to leave
dialog: Earth.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the map lights up with atomic explosions in every
text: city. The sequence stops, rewinds.
text: 
text: This time, sped up, the Earth seems to be drying up -- great
text: swaths of desert grow across Europe and Asia. Massive
text: circular ships are constructed all over the face of the Earth.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS (CONT'D)
dialog: This was their best solution. A
dialog: massive version of the box we found
dialog: on the ice planet, allowing the entire
dialog: human population to escape.
text: 
dialog: At a given moment, the gravity of the Earth is dropped to
dialog: nothing and the massive ships, filled with the entire
dialog: 132.
text: 
text: population of the Earth, lift gently off of the planet in
dialog: search of greener pastures.
text: 
text: Cooper turns away from the machine, bitter.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: So why didn't they return? Why didn't
dialog: they save us?
text: 
text: Brand is staring at the massive map.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Because they were too late. By the
dialog: time they found this place, the people
dialog: who sent them were dead. They were
dialog: unable to fulfill their mission.
text: 
text: Tars points to the next room.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: That was the final problem they tried
dialog: to solve.
text: 
text: Tars moves on.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION
text: 
text: Above them, the blackness of the sky is punctuated with
text: hundreds of crystal shapes, faintly leaking starlight:
text: 
text: Wormholes. Brand looks up at them, entranced.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Where do they lead?
text: 
text: Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping
dialog: some of the wormholes.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: There are millions of them, connecting
dialog: virtually every planetary system in
dialog: the universe. There are thousands
dialog: in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese
dialog: stopped mapping them when they found
dialog: what they were looking for.
text: 
text: Tars walks further. He stops.
text: 
text: The platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic
dialog: version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet,
text: connected to a massive power array, and pointing into the
text: dark space above the sphere.
dialog: 133.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS (CONT'D)
dialog: This was their final creation. They
dialog: had to capture the mini black hole
dialog: just to have enough power to try it.
text: 
text: Several miles above the black box, one of the wormholes glows
text: far brighter than the others, crackling with radiation.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What does it do?
text: 
text: Cooper steps forward. Runs a hand on the cold, strange
text: material the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what
dialog: it does.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: They weren't interested in the other
dialog: wormholes because their mission was
text: to return home. That one leads back
dialog: to Earth. The Earth they were told
dialog: to return to.
text: 
text: Tars walks to the controls for the device.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: But that's impossible...
text: 
text: Tars turns away from the machine.
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: It was only used once. The Chinese
dialog: team attempted to travel back in
dialog: time, to Earth just a few years after
dialog: they had left.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Did they make it?
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: I don't know.
text: 
text: Doyle looks back to Cooper.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Do you really think it works?
text: 
text: Cooper looks up at the machine, suddenly determined.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: We're going to find out.

speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: You know it doesn't work. Time travel
dialog: isn't possible.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You don't know that.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese
dialog: would have suddenly discovered all
dialog: of these incredible technologies.
dialog: But they never made it.
dialog: (BEAT)
dialog: You can't go back, Cooper. You can
dialog: slow things down, but you can't ever
dialog: go back. Our home is gone.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: You listened to all of those messages
dialog: from your family. If you had made
dialog: it back, we would already know.
dialog: There would already be some evidence.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at the machine.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: If you try to use it, you'll die,
dialog: just like the people who built it.
text: 
text: She puts an arm on his shoulder.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Roth was right, Cooper. We have to
dialog: keep going. Keep exploring. We
dialog: have an obligation to try to survive.
dialog: From here we could find a thousand
dialog: places where life could thrive. And
dialog: you're going to return to the one
dialog: place where it can't.

speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I made a promise.

speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I came to say goodbye.
text: 
text: Cooper looks up at her.

scene_heading: INT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION

text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You could have taken one of the other
dialog: ships.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: This one's done all right by us so
dialog: far.
text: 
text: Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the
dialog: fractal life-form.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Will you take this with you? It's
dialog: the last of its kind as well. Thought
dialog: we should double its chances of
dialog: survival. In case I'm wrong.
text: 
text: Cooper takes the sample and looks at the tiny creature inside,
text: trying to escape. He sets it inside the ship. Turns back
text: to her.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Where are you going to go?
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: I don't know. Up there, I guess.
text: 
text: She points up into the great darkness above them.
text: 
text: Tars steps down. Moves over to them.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You're going, too?
text: 
speaker_heading: TARS
dialog: I'm curious. It's my nature. See
dialog: you down the road?
text: 
text: Tars shakes Cooper's hand. Heads onto the Endurance.
dialog: 136.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: Come with us. Please. You wanted
dialog: your whole life to explore. This is
dialog: your chance.
text: 
text: Cooper stares at her. This is what he has always wanted.
dialog: And he has to turn it down.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I'm sorry. I have to find out what
dialog: happened to my sons. I promised
dialog: them.
text: 
text: Brand sees the resolve in his eyes. Knows there's no way to
dialog: change his mind.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND
dialog: You're a man who keeps his promises.
dialog: Make me one-
text: 
text: She takes his hand.
text: 
speaker_heading: BRAND (CONT'D)
dialog: After you're done... come find me.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I promise.
text: 
text: They kiss passionately. Not wanting it to end but knowing
text: that it must. Reluctantly, they separate. Brand turns back
text: to the ship.
text: 
text: She pulls herself onto the ship. Cooper steps back outside
text: and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts
text: off and disappears into the darkness.
text: 
text: Cooper turns away.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION
text: 
text: Cooper watches as radiation pours out of the wormhole high

scene_heading: INT. CHINESE SPACESHIP

text: He keys the controls and the ship lifts off.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Let's go home.
text: 
text: The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the
text: space station and closes in on the wormhole.
text: 
text: Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP. He turns around:
dialog: 137.
text: 
text: The probe they took from the ice planet is belted securely
text: into one of the seats, filled with the garbled machine code
dialog: of the gravitational machine.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: The probe...
text: 
text: Doyle looks back.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: We get back to earth, you and I can
text: try to make sense of the code.
dialog: Rebuild the gravity machine.
text: 
text: Cooper stares at it, suddenly realizing something. He
text: unbuckles himself.
text: 
text: Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. Traces the
text: familiar stars and stripes carved into its side.
text: 
text: Cooper stares at the probe, putting it all together.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: It's going to work.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Of course it's going to work.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: That's not what I mean. This is the
dialog: probe I found in Galveston.
text: 
text: Below them, the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole
dialog: mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity
dialog: well, creating a time machine.
text: 
text: The wormhole mouth is FLARING with radiation.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Brand said there'd be some evidence
dialog: we'd made it. And there was. This.
dialog: (holds up probe)
dialog: But only this. Everything will be

text: 
text: He moves toward Doyle. Doyle stands.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER (CONT'D)
dialog: We have to stop.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about, but you're not touching the

dialog: 138.
text: 
text: Cooper moves closer to Doyle. Doyle pulls out the flair
text: gun. Points it at Cooper.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: You don't need to do this. We won't
dialog: make it back, but this does. The
dialog: secrets are already right on it.
dialog: Maybe someone found it. There's
dialog: hope.
dialog: (SAD)
dialog: But we don't get to go with.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You're not stopping me. I'm going

text: 
text: It's Murph, 30s. He looks at the FARMER who is waiting for

speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: You can't make it work a little

speaker_heading: MURPH

dialog: Not anywhere.
text: 
speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: You don't understand. We're getting
dialog: less than a hundred pounds per acre.
dialog: We need to plant more, not less.

speaker_heading: FARMER (CONT'D)
dialog: You've got to find us some more parts,

scene_heading: INT. HANGAR -- DAY
text: 
text: Murph stares at the darkened shape of a plane under a tarp.
text: He stares at the tarp, unsure if he wants to keep going.
text:

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND

text: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST -- DAY

text: 
scene_heading: INT. NASA FACILITY -- DAY
text: 
text: Murph lets himself inside. Lights a flare.
text: 
text: The place has been gutted. Thieves and scavengers have taken
dialog: almost everything.
text: 
text: Murph finds one of the robots, or what's left of it -- it's
text: been stripped, leaving only the bare composite skeleton.
text: The empty eye sockets stare back at Murph.
text: 
text: Murph looks around the place. There is nothing left to

text: 
text: In the corner, under a pile of rain-soaked garbage:
dialog: 141.
text: 
text: The probe.
text: 
text: No one has bothered to steal it. Murph stares at it.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Murph sweeps detritus off of an ancient computer mainframe
text: that survived the looting. He hooks the probe up to it.
text: 
text: After a minute, the screen fills with a picture of an ice-
text: covered planet. Then nothing. The rest of the probe's drive
text: is filled with garbage, noise.
text: 
text: Murph switches off the screen.
text: 
text: He stands. Begins to leave without the probe. Stops. Turns

text: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Murph is hunched over the probe, trying to pull data off of

speaker_heading: MURPH'S WIFE
dialog: Would you get that thing off of the

scene_heading: INT. BARN -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Murph, now in his 40s, is putting the finishing touches on a
text: large machine. Although slightly different, we recognize
dialog: some of the components and their configuration:
text: 
text: It's a crude version of the gravitational device.
text: 
text: Murph double checks it, then fires up a small gas powered
text: generator. Throws a breaker, feeding power to the unit.
text: 
text: The unit lights up. HUMS. But nothing happens.
dialog: 142.
text: 
text: Murph, disappointed but undaunted, shuts it down and begins

speaker_heading: MURPH

speaker_heading: WIFE
text: Out in the barn. She's been tinkering

text: 
scene_heading: EXT. YARD, MURPH'S HOUSE -- DAY
text: 
text: Murph moves towards the barn, concerned. The shaking is

text: 
text: Emily, now 18, backs out of the barn.
text: 
speaker_heading: EMILY COOPER
dialog: Dad... I'm sorry... I made some
dialog: changes to the machine. I think I
dialog: did something wrong.
text: 
text: Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the

text: the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil.
text: 
text: Finally, the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in
text: a FIERY display.
text: 
text: As the dust clears, Murph and his daughter examine the mess:

scene_heading: INT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY

text: 
dialog: He has kept his promise. Several hundred years too late.
text: 
text: Cooper hunkers down, staring at the space where his kids
text: used to be. Rainwater covers the ancient formica.
text: 
text: It has taken him years to finally reach this place. He has

text: 
scene_heading: INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits.
text: 
text: Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through
text: the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what's left of the
text: structure with fist-sized hail.
text: 
text: Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. He's going
dialog: to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the
dialog: brutal descendants of the weather he knew. They'll finish
text: him off if he steps back outside.
text: 
text: As he watches, the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes
text: over in seconds.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- DAWN
text:

text: and stumbles outside.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. SNOWBOUND FIELD -- DAY

text: Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow. He tries to

text: 
text: Cooper tries to stand back up, but his strength is dwindling.
dialog: 145.
text: 
text: As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out
text: of its broken habitat. It forms together against the cold.
text: 
text: After a moment, it burrows into the ice. As it does, the
text: ice glows faintly. It seems to be right at home.
text: 
text: Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. Was this
dialog: what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along?
text: 
text: Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the
text: driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles
text: a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent.
text: 
text: Finally, he sits down in the snow to die.
text: 
text: As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories
text: of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling
text: forward in the snow.
text: 
text: He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about
dialog: what happens when humans die.
text: 
text: He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet,
text: eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship.
text: 
text: Cooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his

text: 
text: Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. A thousand
text: feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of
text: green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I've got someone who wants to meet
dialog: you.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at her.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper steps inside. The room is dark, still, the only noise
text: is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe.
text: 
text: Cooper steps closer to the bed. The man's skin is paper-
dialog: thin. He is ancient.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: He was moved here after they found
dialog: you. He's a little old for a
dialog: transfer, but they made an exception.
text: 
text: Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to
text: the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on
text: the old man's desk:
text: 
dialog: There are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then
text: the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents.
text: Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes:
text: 
text: Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her
text: family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape
text: Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction.
text: 
text: Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it.
text: 
text: The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's
text: leg in the picture.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: That's him.
dialog: 148.
text: 
text: She points to the old man lying in the bed.
text: 
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: His name is Anthony Welling. Anthony
dialog: Cooper Welling.
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: He's your great great grandson.
dialog: He's been waiting a long time for
dialog: you.
text: 
text: Cooper's eyes well with tears. He steps over to the bed and
text: looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death.
text: 
text: The old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. He
text: strains, trying to reach the bedside table. He's trying to
text: reach the drawer. Cooper helps him open it.
text: 
text: Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man
text: carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few
text: winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper.
text: 
text: Cooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the
text: old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand.
text: 
text: CUT TO:
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING
text: 
text: Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. A middle-aged
text: BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's
dialog: just start off by saying that. It's
dialog: an incredible and... unexpected honor
dialog: to have you here with us.
text: 
text: Cooper smiles, uncomfortable.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: None of us would be here without the
dialog: efforts of you and the other
dialog: crewmembers of the Endurance.
dialog: (smiles, unconvincingly)
dialog: So I don't want you to take this the
dialog: wrong way. But there are some
dialog: questions I've been told to ask.
text: 
text: The man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill
dialog: George Washington on his expense reports.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Shoot.
dialog: 149.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: The rangers who found you reported
dialog: that you had released a sample of an
text: alien life-form into the wild. Which
dialog: is, unfortunately, against
dialog: regulations.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: It was last of its kind. Their planet
dialog: was destroyed.
text: 
text: The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: The rangers attempted to isolate the
dialog: life-form, but it had already spread
text: out of control. It seems to be
dialog: thriving.
text: 
text: He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A
text: considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing.
text: 
text: Cooper begins laughing. Which makes the administrator even
dialog: less comfortable.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you tell me why you... elected
dialog: to release the life-form back on
dialog: earth?
text: 
text: Cooper is still laughing.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Because that was the plan.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: Whose plan?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: (SMILES)
dialog: I don't know.
text: 
text: The administrator tries to smile back. Makes a few notes in
text: his file. Changes the subject.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: My assistant tells me you've applied
dialog: for a position with the exploration
dialog: fleet.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Feel like I should be pulling my
dialog: weight.
dialog: 150.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The
dialog: truth is, most of the fleet's
dialog: personnel are automated. There are
dialog: a small number of crewed ships. But
dialog: there are great numbers of candidates.
dialog: Very well trained candidates.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: I was hoping to enroll in a course.
dialog: Try to get myself up to speed on the
dialog: new systems.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: I don't want you to take this the
dialog: wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I
dialog: said, you're a hero. But the truth
dialog: is we have somewhat limited resources.
text: 
text: Cooper remembers this conversation. He looks down.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: No one's heard anything from Brand?
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: I'm sorry. Officially, she's been
dialog: listed as missing for over 200 years.
dialog: Mind you, I guess you turned up
dialog: eventually, didn't you?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Am I really going to hurt anybody by
dialog: going to look for her? I just need
dialog: a small ship. I made a promise.
text: 
text: The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to
dialog: tell this guy the lay of the land?
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR
dialog: Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero.
dialog: You're the oldest man in the human
dialog: race. Don't you want to take it
dialog: easy?
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: I hope you understand, we all you
dialog: hold you in the highest possible
text: regard.
dialog: (QUIET)
dialog: Which is why they're never going to
dialog: let you go off by yourself in a
dialog: spaceship. I'm sorry.
text: 
text: Cooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on
text: the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger.
text: He puts his hands in his pockets.
dialog: 151.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I've got some good news, however.
dialog: (BIG SMILE)
dialog: We all know about your early life,
dialog: Mr Cooper. I wrote a paper on it
dialog: when I was a boy. And I think we
dialog: found something you'll really enjoy.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY
text: 
text: Corn blows in an artificial breeze. A red tractor makes its
text: way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance.
text: 
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: The machines do most of the work, of
dialog: course, but we were able to get you
dialog: a few acres. You're going to be a
dialog: farmer again.
text: 
text: After a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from
text: the seat. Looks at the front steering linkage, which is
text: jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead
text: and begins working the branch out of the machine.
text: 
text: He looks miserable.
text: 
text: A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. Offers Cooper
text: a bottle of water. Cooper accepts it.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION
text: 
text: Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar
text: floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb
text: into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION
text: 
text: Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack
dialog: of the bat as an intramural team from the university
dialog: practices.
text: 
text: Cooper watches. He looks bored.
text: 
text: The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher
text: shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.
text: But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.
text: 
text: Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward
text: the town center above.
text: 
text: After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a
text: building high above them.
text: 
text: Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing.
dialog: 152.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
text: 
text: Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling
text: around in the back of his head.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Settings: general settings, security
text: SETTINGS--
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Curiosity. New level setting. 100
dialog: percent.
text: 
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: Confirmed. Would you like to make
dialog: any additional changes?
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Sense of humor. New level setting.
dialog: 100 percent. Wait.
dialog: (THINKS)
dialog: 80 percent.
text: 
text: He begins putting the robot back together.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT
text: 
text: Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before.
text: They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of
text: alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the
text: cylinder into shade, then darkness.
text: 
text: The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
text: 
text: A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek-
text: looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.
text: 
text: After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar
text: floor, sticking to the shadows.
text: 
text: As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better
text: look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing
text: a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.
text: 
text: Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with
text: a click against the mirror-like floor.
text: 
text: Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his
text: finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.
text: 
text: Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the
text: ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes.
text: Nothing happens. He punches in a few more.
dialog: 153.
text: 
text: Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS.
text: 
scene_heading: INT. SHIP
text: 
text: Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. Looks over
text: the controls. The robot straps himself in next to him.
text: Cooper looks up through the windows.
text: 
text: The inky black void of space beckons.
text: 
text: Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.
text: 
speaker_heading: COOPER
dialog: Where do you want to go first?
text: 
text: The robot thinks it over.
text: 
scene_heading: EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
text: 
text: The technician walks back into the hangar. He walks along
text: the row of ships till he reaches the last one.
text: 
dialog: It's not there.
text: 
text: He looks out into the blackness of the void. Sees a tiny
text: glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller.
