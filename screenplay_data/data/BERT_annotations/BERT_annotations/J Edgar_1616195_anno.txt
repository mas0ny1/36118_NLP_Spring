scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE - 1963
text: CLOSE ON: The DEATH MASK OF JOHN DILINGER, his GLASSES, his
text: STRAW HAT, his HALF SMOKED CIGAR and his GUN -- IN A CASE.
text: CLOSE ON: Shaking, old hands clip an article out of a
text: newspaper. Several lines have already been underlined.
text: “...SEEMING INABILITY TO GAIN CONVICTIONS IN EVEN THE MOST
dialog: HEINOUS CRIMES...”
dialog: 
scene_heading: “... APPARENTLY FALTERED UNDER THE AWESOME BURDEN,
text: COMPLEXITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF HIS OFFICE...”
text: “...I HAVE NOTHING BUT SYMPATHY FOR THE MAN WHO ONCE SERVED
dialog: HIS COUNTRY SO WELL...”
text: CLOSE ON: Beads of sweat on a forehead. The phone rings. The
text: sound of someone picking up, then a voice on the other end:
speaker_heading: OLD HELEN GANDY (V.O.)
dialog: Sir, the writer is here from the PR
dialog: Department.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)(0.S.)
dialog: Set him up a typewriter in my outer
dialog: office... and show him my photos of
dialog: A. Mitchell Palmer.
scene_heading: INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S HOME / LIBRARY - 1919 - NIGHT
text: A tall, strong, square jawed man in his late 40's, A.
text: MITCHELL PALMER, sits in the downstairs library of his four
text: story townhouse on R street, a posh DC neighborhood in 1919.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: Attorney General Palmer was a
dialog: Quaker. He didn’t believe in war.
dialog: But he understood the necessity of
dialog: strength and resolve. Believe--
text: Palmer watches his WIFE pad quietly up the stairs. He checks
text: a clock against his watch and corrects the minute hand. 11PM.
scene_heading: INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S HOME / BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Palmer undresses, but instead of joining his wife in bed, he
text: clicks on a lamp by a chair and settles in with a book.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: --what you will from historians.
dialog: Most write from a present
text: perspective, forgetting context.
dialog: Mitchell Palmer was a hero.
text: Palmer looks to a window, listening to the WHIR OF A
text: MOTORCAR, the HORSE HOOVES ON THE COBBLESTONES. He goes back
text: to reading ignoring the new sounds outside: A CAR PULLS UP, A
scene_heading: DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES. FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE. THEN A CRASH
text: DOWNSTAIRS AS IF SOMETHING WAS THROWN AGAINST THE DOOR.
text: A BLINDING FLASH! A MASSIVE EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE HOUSE!
text: THE WALLS CRACK, GLASS SHATTERS, FURNITURE GOES FLYING!
text: Palmer is hurled from his chair, his wife thrown from her
text: bed. Palmer lifts himself off the floor, rushes to his wife
text: and pulls her out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S HOME / STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
text: They race down the twisted, crumbling stairs. Palmer falls
text: through a broken step, pulls himself back up, and wills them
text: to a bedroom door where a GIRL CAN BE HEARD SCREAMING.
text: The door frame has buckled, but its no match for Palmer’s
text: brute strength. He throws his body against the door,
text: revealing his TEEN DAUGHTER crying hysterically, the electric
text: lights flickering on and off. His wife runs to her side.
text: Everything is suddenly silent. Palmer cautiously navigates
text: what remains of the stairs. Around any corner is a potential
text: assassin. A sudden crash! An assailant? He braces himself and
text: pulls a banister rung off to use as a weapon.
text: As he turns the corner to the ground floor, he finds utter
text: destruction: A STUFFED ELKS HEAD thrown to the floor, parquet
text: flooring ripped to pieces, piles of rubble, and everywhere:
text: SPOTS OF FRESH BLOOD starting to drip down the walls.
text: He looks to where his front wall and windows once were. Out
text: on the street a car has blown over. And piercing the silence:
speaker_heading: FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT (V.O.)
dialog: Mr. Palmer?
text: Palmer rushes beside the mantle for protection, but its
text: bricks crumble to the floor.
text: Stepping into the cavernous remains of the home is a 30-year-
text: old version of future president FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT with
text: braces on his legs and a crutch. Behind him, lifting her
text: skirt to avoid stepping on the hem is a young ELEANOR.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL PALMER
dialog: Mr. Roosevelt? Thank Thee. Thank
dialog: thee Lord it’s you.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. / SEWARD SQUARE - THAT NIGHT
text: A young man, 24, burst out the door of a modest two story
text: home in a simple suit, holding a bike. He’s built like a fire
text: plug with wavy black hair, attractive in a bulldogish way.
text: He hops on his bike and peddles determinedly, stopping at
text: each intersection like a model citizen, then peddling his
text: heart out again. This is young JOHN EDGAR HOOVER.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
text: Across the country, eight bombs
text: exploded that night. All at 11PM.
dialog: Two United States Senators, four
dialog: cabinet members, a Supreme Court
dialog: Justice, John D. Rockerfeller, J.P.
text: Morgan. All of them targeted.
text: As he rides out of frame, REVEAL: only a few blocks away, the
text: dome of the US Capital peaks over the tops of the working
text: class homes. Further in the distance puffs of smoke and
text: flames. The city is in turmoil.
scene_heading: EXT. ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER'S HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Not a single window on the block survived the blast. Tree
text: limbs are down. Cars are on their sides. The block is lit up
text: with flood lights. Detectives and reporters swarm. Police
text: push neighbors back, roping off the neighborhood.
text: A LONG POV: Mitchell Palmer’s giant shoe steps through the
text: wreckage, almost crushing a severed finger lying in the
text: street. He is flanked by young Roosevelt and another up and
text: coming neighbor, young DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL PALMER
dialog: This may be the end of days for
dialog: this country, Dwight.
text: Palmer picks up the finger without putting on a glove, and
text: hands it to an INSPECTOR who puts it in a TRASH TIN.
text: REVEAL: this is all young Edgar’s POV. He is on his bike just
text: behind the police ropes watching the investigators carelessly
text: sweep up evidence: two guns, remains of a suitcase, an
dialog: English/Italian dictionary.
text: IN A MANNER THAT WILL BECOME A TRADEMARK OF THE FILM: we see
text: what Edgar sees: a brief imagined STRING OF LIGHT connects
text: the severed finger to A BLOWN OPEN BRIEFCASE. He’s making
dialog: connections. Organizing.
text: But the strings vanish when the inspectors use buckets to
text: CLEAN UP THE BLOOD instead of collecting it. It’s not clumsy,
dialog: it’s customary. This isn’t 2009, it’s 1919. Still, Edgar is
text: disturbed by the vanishing connections.
text: Suddenly, a gust of wind shakes the trees and reveals
text: hundreds of PINK HAND-BILLS in the road. Their festive color
text: stands in stark contrast to the destruction. Edgar gathers
text: any that blow past the police line. He reads one. We hear:
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: “There will have to be BLOODSHED:
dialog: there will have to be MURDER: we
dialog: will KILL because it is necessary:
dialog: we will destroy to rid the world of
dialog: your tyrannical institution.”
text: ANGLE ON: Palmer notices Edgar collecting the fliers.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Is he a neighbor, sir? Should we
dialog: question him?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL PALMER
dialog: No. He works in my office.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR
dialog: Is he an investigator?
speaker_heading: MITCHELL PALMER
text: He manages the filing system.
text: And without knowing he’s been spotted, Edgar jumps back on
text: his bike and peddles away holding the BRIGHT PINK FLIERS.
speaker_heading: AGENT SMITH (V.0O.) (PRE-LAP)
dialog: You were at Attorney General
dialog: Palmer’s home that night?
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE / FBI HALLWAY - 1963 - DAY
text: The camera cruises down the halls of the “MODERN” FBI. The
text: agents are dressed to perfection. Everything is in its place.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: Leave that to the reader’s
dialog: imagination. It’s important to give
text: the protagonist a bit of mystery.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - SAME TIME
text: A handsome, clean cut young FBI agent, AGENT SMITH, sits
text: behind a 60’s typewriter taking notes on a pad of paper.
speaker_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: I could allude to a young man whose
dialog: description matches yours. The best
dialog: of both worlds.
text: REVEAL: standing across the room behind a mahogany desk is a
text: stout old man with a mashed in nose wearing a three piece
text: suit and holding one of those OLD PINK FLIERS from 1919. This
text: is Hoover, almost 40 years later, now J. EDGAR HOOVER. He
text: lets out a laugh that leaves behind a smile. He isn’t the
text: brute he’s come to be known as. He’s surprisingly warm.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Where did you get your law degree?
speaker_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: George Washington. I grew up here.
dialog: I had a mom to take care of, so I
dialog: stayed close. I received an English
dialog: degree there as well.
text: Hoover walks behind him, reads out of his typewriter.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Then I don’t have to tell you that
dialog: what determines a legacy is often
dialog: what isn’t seen... What’s critical
dialog: at this moment is that we RE-
dialog: clarify the difference between
dialog: villain and hero. How do you think
dialog: that compares with today?
text: The young man winds the paper out of the typewriter.
speaker_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: I’m not sure, sir. I’d like to hear
dialog: more. I could come back tomorrow.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Fine. The pages stay here though.
speaker_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Hoover grabs the young agent’s hand and shakes it, holding it
text: a bit longer than normal. The agent knows he’s being sized
text: up. He goes, taking his typewriter with him.
text: Left alone, Hoover inspects the hand he just shook with. IT’S
text: PERFECTLY DRY. It WAS a test and Hoover seems pleased. He
text: puts the OLD PINK FLIER back in an ancient file folder.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE / FBI HALLWAY - 1919 - DAY
text: Young Edgar walks down the long hall (same as earlier, but 45
text: years earlier) with a staccato gate in a crisp white shirt,
text: holding that same (but brand new) file with THE PINK FLIERS.
text: A GAGGLE OF SECRETARIES, dresses to the floor, are headed
text: right toward him. Most are far older than him.
speaker_heading: HEAD SECRETARY
dialog: Good morning, John. Mr. Palmer has
dialog: asked that you attend the emergency
dialog: meeting today.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: It’s Mr. Hoover, please.
speaker_heading: HEAD SECRETARY
dialog: Two o’clock. Don’t be too early
dialog: again. It’s as rude as being tardy.
text: She bustles off with the rest, but not before a slim, young
text: secretary, 22, with dark hair, lovely eyes, and a high
text: collar makes eye contact with him. Edgar isn’t shy.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: And who is this lovely addition to
dialog: the secretarial pool?
speaker_heading: HEAD SECRETARY
dialog: Helen, introduce yourself.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: Pleased to meet you, Mr. Hoover.
dialog: I’m Helen Gandy.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Welcome to the Department of
dialog: Justice, Miss. Gandy... Please let
dialog: Mr. Palmer know I will attend.
text: As if he had any choice in the matter. The secretaries brush
text: off, mocking his attempt at grandiosity. Edgar shares one
text: last glance with Helen before she vanishes.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. / PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - EVENING
text: Packards, Model Ts, bikes and horse drawn coaches rumble by
text: Edgar’s trolly, all sharing the cobblestone streets.
text: IT’S THE MIDDLE OF THE D.C. RACE RIOTS: Smoke drifts from a
text: business a block down. The trolly keeps pace with OFFICERS
text: chasing a BLACK MAN. But as they reach an intersection, the
text: police are greeted with a CROWD OF OTHER BLACK MEN. The
text: police are overwhelmed. Edgar watches like it’s a play,
text: refusing to let it dampen his mood.
scene_heading: EXT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - LATER
text: As Edgar approaches the house, he spots a GRAY-HAIRED,
text: EMACIATED MAN rocking manically on the porch in a wicker
text: chair. Edgar steels himself and climbs the steps.
text: As soon as the old man spots Edgar, he starts SCREAMING
text: BLOODY MURDER. Edgar ignores it, he won’t let this ruin his
text: cheerful mood either. He walks into his house.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: As Edgar walks in, he sees his MOTHER, a stout, outgoing,
text: opinionated woman bent over, tuning the radio, her giant back
text: side to him. It’s all he sees. A FLASH--
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - (IN HIS MIND / MEMORY)
text: Edgar sits at his mother’s feet. She pets him like a child.
scene_heading: HOOVER’S MOTHER
dialog: Madame Marcia held court this
dialog: morning. Her premonition... I
dialog: should buy a dress. She said your
dialog: father will die soon, and when he
dialog: does, you will rise to be the most
dialog: powerful man in the country. Your
dialog: brother is a good man, EDGAR, but
dialog: you will restore our family to
dialog: greatness. EDGAR--
text: He looks up with childlike fear. Her “Edgar's” cross the cut--
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME —- NIGHT
text: In reality, Edgar is sitting by the radio with his Mother.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: --Edgar? Am I boring you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I’m listening. You fired the maid.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: I told her after she was through
dialog: with her work, she could quit as I
dialog: was not paying for her impudence.
dialog: The whole Negro race is in open
dialog: revolt.
scene_heading: YOUNG HOOVER EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: I could open an They’ve gotten too
dialog: investigation. comfortable.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Did you hear me? I said I could
dialog: open an investigation.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: Say what you mean.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: Mr. Palmer called me into a meeting
dialog: today. The war against the radicals
dialog: has begun. He insisted that I lead
text: a new Anti-Radical division.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: And did you leap like a dog?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I told him, “This is perhaps the
dialog: greatest threat our nation has ever
dialog: faced. I can NOT take the job...
dialog: unless I feel certain I can be
dialog: effective.”
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: Well done! But you’ll take it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Three thousand a year.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: I’ll have to get you all new
dialog: clothes! You can’t dress like this
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I have forty names of suspected
dialog: radicals already, in only four
dialog: hours. I’1l have ten thousand by
dialog: the end of the month. And I have my
dialog: own staff. Trusted agents.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: (critical)
dialog: Are you smoking, Edgar?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (ashamed)
dialog: It doesn’t come naturally.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: Listen to the doctor. With this new
dialog: burden, your nerves could get the
dialog: best of you. You don’t want to end
dialog: up like your father. Go try one
dialog: now. You can put your father in his
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I have to get ready for dinner.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: You’re abandoning me tonight?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: It’s with a typist. She’s very
dialog: organized.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: Is it a date?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I think so... I’m going to show her
dialog: my old card catalogue system at the
dialog: library of Congress.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: (disappointed, critical)
dialog: Card catalogues, Edgar?
text: And with that, the screen door opens and Edgar’s emaciated
text: father walks in and down to the basement without saying a
text: word. Both pretend not to see or hear him. She leaps up and
text: heads to the basement door.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Romance her. Wear a blue tie. You
dialog: look so handsome in that blue tie!
text: And she slams the basement door shut, trapping her crazy
text: husband downstairs. She seemed downright jolly about it.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS - NIGHT
text: Edgar (in his blue tie) and Helen are surrounded by THOUSANDS
text: OF BOOKS AND SHELVES, standing in front of a MASSIVE FILING
text: SYSTEM in the dimly lit, breathtaking heart of the Library.
text: It’s romantic, clandestine. The only other person there is a
text: NIGHT GUARD well in the distance.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I helped develop it. You see, each
dialog: item is assigned an index card with
dialog: a completely unique code indicating
dialog: its topic, title, author, and
dialog: location. What took days to locate,
dialog: now takes minutes. Name a topic, or
dialog: an author. Anything.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: Indiscretion.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: What era?
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: Present day.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Time me.
text: Edgar dives into the catalogue system. Much like the blood
dialog: and briefcase at the Palmer house bombing, we see this search
text: through Edgar’s mind. The same LIT STRINGS appear momentarily
text: sending him to one row of files, then one column, then one
text: specific file. LIT STRINGS appear and evaporate with the
text: splendor of lightening bugs on a southern summer.
text: He pulls out a single card and flashes it to Helen. She
text: giggles. He leads her in his speedy way to a towering row of
text: book cases. LIT STRINGS ARE EVERYWHERE, all leading to a
text: single book. He pulls it out: CONTEMPORARY COURTSHIP.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: How do you know I didn’t mean
dialog: POLITICAL indiscretion?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: If you’d like to start over, we can.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: No. This will do.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: How long did I take?
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
text: One minute, ten seconds.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Imagine if every citizen in the
dialog: country was uniquely identifiable
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: ll.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: with their own card and number.
dialog: Say, the pattern on their fingers.
dialog: Imagine how quickly they could be
dialog: found when they committed a crime.
text: He re-files the book, clearly missing that she’s been
text: flirting. She’s a little disappointed.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: It’s all very impressive, John.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I’m sorry... Should we go?
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: It’s up to you.
text: He knows what he needs to do. And with his hands at his side,
text: he leans in for a kiss. It’s awkward. Like a school boy.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Hoover...
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Did I do something wrong?
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: No. But I’m not sure where you
dialog: think this is headed.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Right. Of course.
text: And with the precision of an army cadet, he gets down on one
text: knee and grabs hold of her hand.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Miss. Gandy, despite the brief time
dialog: we’ve known each other, I feel
dialog: assured that you would make a fine
dialog: companion. Your strength, your
dialog: character, your education--
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: Are you poking fun at me?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: Please stand up, Mr. Hoover.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (he does, humiliated)
dialog: I would appreciate it if you didn’t
dialog: share this with the other women in
dialog: the typing pool.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Would you mind telling me wh-wh-wh-
dialog: what fl--
dialog: (speeds up to kill the stutter)
dialog: flaw you’ve found in my character?
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: No. We just met.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (speedy, defensive)
dialog: of course. But I’m a fast and
dialog: accurate judge of character. We’ve
dialog: gone out three times. Many people do,
dialog: but I don’t. It’s my most treasured
dialog: skill. I see people right off for
dialog: what they are. And please, call me
dialog: Edgar. It’s what my mother uses.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: Edgar, can you keep a secret?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: You have my word.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDRY
dialog: I have no interest in getting
dialog: married. My work comes first.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (bruised)
dialog: I see... Then perhaps you’1l
dialog: consider the position of personal
dialog: secretary for the new radical
dialog: division. In this moment of need...
dialog: for our country.
text: That’s a proposal she can accept. He fights back the
text: humiliation, chin up, and makes a bee line out of there.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE - 1963
text: This is Hoover’s small private office. A RED BUZZER rings on
text: his desk. He glares at it. It buzzes again.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Miss Gandy!
text: And an OLD HELEN GANDY walks in carrying files.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: The nitwit Kennedy child rang his
dialog: baby buzzer again. Perhaps he needs
text: a fresh diaper.
text: Hoover takes her files and neatly orders them into his
text: private cabinet. He locks it back.
scene_heading: OLD HELEN GANDRY
dialog: Would you like me to find out what
dialog: the Attorney General needs?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: I would like you to finish the
dialog: transcript from the Los Angeles
dialog: recording. When you’re done, we’ll
dialog: answer his buzzer.
scene_heading: OLD HELEN GANDRY
dialog: Okay... Edgar? Agent Smith is back.
dialog: He has questions about the Palmer
dialog: raids. Should I tell him to go?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: (lights up)
dialog: No... Do you like him, Helen?
scene_heading: OLD HELEN GANDRY
dialog: I don’t have an opinion of him yet.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: I like him. I trust him.
scene_heading: OLD HELEN GANDRY
dialog: I’1ll set him up in your outer
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: No. Set him up a desk in here.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE - 1964
text: Hoover is bright and cheery again as he spins a tale in his
text: rapid pace for the young FBI agent who sits typing away.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: In 1920 we had no federal laws, no
dialog: power, no firearms, and Congress
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: liked it that way. The criminals
dialog: ran free. But there was no law
dialog: against keeping track of radicals.
dialog: I compiled note cards on over 5000
dialog: names. And called the one
dialog: Department that held a small piece
text: of untested power.
speaker_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: The Department of Labor. The power
dialog: to deport, sir.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: But only to deport people who
dialog: checked two boxes. They had to be
dialog: foreign citizens. AND, they had to
dialog: be working to harm the country.
speaker_heading: YOUNG FBI MAN
dialog: The Labor Department cooperated?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Of course not. No one freely shares
dialog: power in Washington DC, Agent Smith.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR / OFFICE - DAY - 1919
text: Young Edgar sits behind Palmer who shakes EDGAR’S NOTE CARDS
text: bearing names of suspected radicals. Edgar is in awe as his
text: Mentor rants to the heads of the Labor Dept., ABERCROMBIE and
text: CAMINETTI, and their young LABOR DEPARTMENT LAWYER.
speaker_heading: MITCHELL PALMER
dialog: You mean to tell me there is no law
dialog: under which YOU can issue a warrant
dialog: for the arrest of an alien when I
dialog: certify that he is subject to
dialog: deportation?!
scene_heading: LABOR DEPT LAWYER
dialog: Without evidence, Mr. Attorney
dialog: General? No! There exists a Due
dialog: process of law, sir!
speaker_heading: MITCHELL PALMER
dialog: Due process of law? What about the
dialog: threat to our country!?
text: Edgar looks to an old man in the corner, CAMINETTI. A FREEZE
scene_heading: FRAME OF: EDGAR’S POV OF CAMINETTI’S UNFLATTERING SCOWL:

scene_heading: EXT. A PACKED HALL - 1919 - DAY
text: A fiery, stout woman (hair up, glasses on her nose) stands on
text: stage shaking her fist at a crowd of 3000 red-banner waving,
dialog: slogan chanting Russians, Jews, Fins, Poles, Italians...
speaker_heading: EMMA GOLDMAN
dialog: I am a revolutionist by nature and
dialog: temperament and as such I claim the
dialog: right to rebel and resist invasion
dialog: by all means, force included,
dialog: consequently, a destructionist!
text: From a balcony, Edgar listens, jotting down notes.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: --Emma Goldman, hero of the radical
dialog: movement. She was set to be
dialog: released from prison in two weeks.
dialog: If I could hand CAMINETTI, Emma
dialog: Goldman, he’d deport her without a
dialog: thought. We’d have our precedent...
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE - 1963
speaker_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: But she was a citizen, sir.
text: Hoover has gone silent. He’s focused on his frosted glass and
text: steel back door. He watches the SILHOUETTE OF AN OLD MAN walk
text: past and pause. He waits, breathless. The figure limps away.
text: The sound of a door beyond his opens and closes.
speaker_heading: YOUNG FBI MAN
dialog: Would you like to stop, sir?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: No... It’s hard for you to imagine
dialog: today, but there was a time when
dialog: the average American feared for

scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO SKYLINE - 1919 - NIGHT
text: The only thing lighting the city of Chicago is a half moon

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Excuse, me sir?
dialog: (the man ignores him)
dialog: Is Mrs. Goldman really in there?
speaker_heading: MAN AT JAIL
dialog: Who's asking?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I’m a fan. I’ve read your writing
dialog: as well. Do you work with her?
speaker_heading: MAN AT JAIL
dialog: If you’re truly interested in the

dialog: stalking members on the streets
text: like a sycophant. Come to a rally.
dialog: Organize.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes, sir. But for now, may I have
dialog: your autograph?
text: Hoover holds out a newspaper with a story by the man,
text: “Bolshevik America.” The man autographs the article.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE / BUREAU FILE ROOM - 1919
text: Edgar is with his new inner circle, THREE HANDSOME AGENTS and

text: raid. Hitting all of them at once.
text: An older agent with a BIG MUSTACHE has questions.
scene_heading: MUSTACHED AGENT
dialog: And who are “they?”
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: That’s what you have to find out.
dialog: We need a card on every radical
dialog: person in the country. Who they
dialog: are, where they live, what they
dialog: say, what group they belong to.
scene_heading: MUSTACHED AGENT
dialog: Who have already committed crimes?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I care less if they’ve already
dialog: committed a crime, and more if they
dialog: plan to.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT 2
dialog: How many are on our team?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Only you four.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: I’ll have locks installed.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: No locks. That would draw
dialog: attention. Nothing will be
dialog: alphabetically ordered. The cards
dialog: will be broken down into subjects
dialog: and categories. The system will be
dialog: simple enough if it’s been
dialog: explained. If not, finding
dialog: information will prove impossible.
dialog: Trust no one. Not even fellow
dialog: agents. Half of our colleagues are
text: on both sides of the payroll.
scene_heading: MUSTACHED AGENT
dialog: And the crimes we are investigating
dialog: aren’t crimes... they are ideas?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: If their idea is to come to this
dialog: country and plot the overthrow of our
dialog: government, then that IS a crime.
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: MUSTACHED AGENT
dialog: Mrs. Goldman is not an alien. She
dialog: married a U.S. Citizen.
text: Edgar opens the article he had autographed outside Prison.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: The man she married hasn’t visited
dialog: her once in prison, but the man
dialog: she’s lived with since her wedding
dialog: day... visits her nightly.
scene_heading: MUSTACHED AGENT
dialog: Smells like a Mitchell Palmer
dialog: publicity stunt to me. Tell me,
dialog: John, what happens when we raid
dialog: this list of yours, and we find
dialog: NOTHING? No guns, no bombs, just
dialog: innocent people deported--
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (taking it personally)
dialog: From every corner of this nation,
dialog: the American people have urged the
dialog: Attorney General to do something
dialog: about the violence and return the
dialog: United States to peace and glory. I
dialog: am happy to send your objections to
dialog: Palmer himself, but in the
dialog: meantime, you will expose Miss
dialog: Goldman’s sham marriage... and
dialog: change that suit of yours.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT 1
dialog: Pardon me, John?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (re: his unfashionable suit)
dialog: Your suit. Have some respect for
dialog: yourself, and more importantly show
dialog: some respect to this Bureau.
text: Edgar leaves the room in a huff. The other agents turn away
text: from the challenging mustached Agent. He’s played his hand.
scene_heading: EXT. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LOBBY - DAY
text: Edgar walks toward a group of press. Writers, Cameras, all
text: waiting for him. They eye him curiously, who is this kid?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Today... um upon her release, Miss

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Yeah? Who are you, mister?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: John. John E. Hoover.
text: It’s not a home run, but they scribble down his name.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIS ISLAND / COURTROOM - DAY
text: An INSPECTOR oversees a formal examination. Edgar hands him a
text: checklist of accusations and sits directly in front of a
text: tired looking Emma Goldman at a table filled with government
text: lawyers. He examines her ill fitting “fraud of a dress.” She
text: catches him doing it and is distracted.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR SCHELL
dialog: Miss Goldman, do you live with the
dialog: Man you claim to be married to?
speaker_heading: EMMA GOLDMAN
dialog: I decline to answer.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR SCHELL
dialog: Are you aware the man who married
dialog: you had no authority to do so?
speaker_heading: EMMA GOLDMAN
dialog: I decline to answer.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR SCHELL
dialog: Miss Goldman, are you an anarchist?
speaker_heading: EMMA GOLDMAN
dialog: I decline to answer
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR SCHELL
dialog: (growing frustrated)
dialog: Do you deny that you are an
dialog: anarchist?
speaker_heading: EMMA GOLDMAN
dialog: I decline to answer.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR SCHELL
dialog: Do you believe in the overthrow by
dialog: force or violence of the Government
dialog: of the United States?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: EMMA GOLDMAN
dialog: I refuse to answer.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR SCHELL
dialog: Do you advocate the assassination

speaker_heading: EMMA GOLDMAN
dialog: I refuse to answer.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR SCHELL
dialog: (composes himself, then)
dialog: This ALIEN has refused to answer
dialog: any questions pertaining to the
dialog: charges contained in the warrant,
dialog: notwithstanding the fact that every
dialog: opportunity was afforded her... I
dialog: recommend deportation.
text: EDGAR’S POV: of old Caminette’s face (earlier). Again, THE

speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: And just like that, we had our
dialog: precedent.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE / BUREAU FILE ROOMS - 1919
text: The File room has grown exponentially. The cabinets are
text: spilling over. Edgar is pulling out cards. There are LIGHT
text: STRING CONNECTIONS everywhere. Helen Gandy interrupts:
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: Edgar? Should I arrange our travel
dialog: to Paterson for Valentines Day?
text: There’s trepidation in his pause. Is this a romantic gesture?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes... Of course, Miss Gandy.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY RAIDS / MONTAGE - 1920 - NIGHT
scene_heading: SET TO: BOBBY BENTON’S 1963 hit “ROSES ARE RED (MY LOVE)”, a

text: An Army of 500 Police, 35 troopers and bomb squad detectives
text: barge out of a station and fan out across Manhattan.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RUSSIAN PEOPLES HOUSE COMMUNITY CENTER - THAT NIGHT
text: FBI MEN in white shirts, ties, and winter coats and POLICEMAN
text: with copper badges and batons burst into a building. They are
dialog: 21.
text: greeted with jeers, taunts and bottles from the Russians and
text: anarchists inside.
text: The batons come out. Heads are split. Students are pushed
text: down stairs, bookcases are overturned, there’s blood and
text: broken bones everywhere -- IT’S VIOLENT AND BLOODY.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN BETWEEN D.C. AND PATERSON N.J. - THAT NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON: A puff of smoke as Edgar lights up a cigarette to
text: try and calm his nerves. Helen Gandy is sits next to him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: They found a counterfeiting press,
text: five pistols, two automatics. And
dialog: in Trenton, they found gunpowder,
dialog: copper, brass wire, batteries--
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
text: A bomb factory.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: 120 arrests in Detroit, 41 in
dialog: Philadelphia, 17 here, so far.
text: REVEAL: On his lap are 33 more warrants “for subversive
dialog: radical activity.” Can’t leave the work at the office?
scene_heading: EXT. NARROW CITY STREET / NEW JERSEY - LATE THAT NIGHT
text: Black sedans drive slowly down the snow covered street. Their
text: lights shut off and they coast to a stop. Edgar and Helen’s
text: feet step out quietly. But this is no date -- a dozen other
text: officers get out with them.
text: A SECRET SERVICE OFFICER preps his ten men.
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE OFFICER
text: These men are armed, violent, and
dialog: prepared to kill to avoid capture--
text: Privately, Edgar hands out firearms to SIX OF HIS MEN.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
dialog: Are we allowed to use these, sir?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: These are gifts from me to you.
dialog: There is no law preventing us from
dialog: using our own weapons.
text: Edgar can’t naturally handle a firearm. He tucks it away,
text: concealing it from a journalist and Miss Gandy who stand at a
dialog: remove.
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: INT. PRINTING PRESS / NEW JERSEY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Bureau Agents, Secret Service, and local cops burst through
text: the front door, guns drawn. It’s a classic raid.
speaker_heading: CHORUS OF OFFICERS
text: Hands in the air. -- On the ground.
text: THE RADICALS inside dive for cover, reach for weapons or run
text: up stairs, but they are quickly tackled, beaten, and pursued.
text: One YOUNG RADICAL escapes up the stairs. Two agents chase
text: him. Edgar, the last in the door, slowly starts up the stairs
text: after them. HE CAN HEAR A SCUFFLE. It sounds violent. He
text: slows his step, and draws his gun.
text: He reaches the door, ready to fire the first shot of his
text: life, but finds it’s not a scuffle at all. The young radical
text: is being beaten within an inch of his life by the officers.
text: Edgar watches. He’s never seen such violence first hand. Is
dialog: it revolting? Titillating? Both?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: That’s enough.
text: The room goes silent, making the screaming downstairs seem
text: all the louder. Edgar ignores it. He’s focused on: A PRINTING
text: PRESS in the corner -- AND A STACK OF PINK PAPER -- identical
text: to the color found the night of the Palmer house bombing. A
text: STRING LIGHT FLASHES OUT THE WINDOW AND CONNECTS TO -—
scene_heading: EXT. ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S HOME —- FLASHBACK
text: --all of the PINK PAPER at Palmer’s house months ago.
text: Edgar has completed the circle -- Guns, bombs, and the
text: solution to the Palmer raid mystery. The raids are a success.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIS ISLAND HOLDING CELLLS - MIDNIGHT
text: Snow covers the ground. Edgar is dressed warmly, walking with
text: a congressman, dignitaries and reporters.
text: Hundreds of prisoners are being marched through the snow,
text: single file to a gangplank and onto a tugboat. Edgar watches
text: a tired, filthy Emma Goldman struggle up the gangplank to the
text: tugboat and disappear.
text: The camera reveals a massive, rotting 5000 ton ship, THE
dialog: BUFORD. This won’t be a pleasant journey for the prisoners.
text: Above them all looms the mighty Statue of Liberty.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: AGENT SMITH (V.O.)
dialog: But everyone in the Bureau involved
dialog: in those arrests lost their jobs,
dialog: correct? Even Palmer himself?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: Most did. And there is the lesson.
text: The bombs stopped. Peace came. And
dialog: the American people forgot there
dialog: was ever a threat. --
scene_heading: EXT. ATTORNEY GENERAL PALMER’S OFFICE - 1921
text: From afar, Edgar watches assistants carry boxes out of his
text: boss’s office as Palmer takes a moment to assess his loss.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: -- So when political adversaries
dialog: attacked Palmer in his run for the
dialog: White House, when they attacked the
dialog: Bureau, the country let it happen.
text: Palmer feels eyes on him, and looks up to Edgar.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S INNNER OFFICE - DAY - 1964
speaker_heading: YOUNG FBI MAN
dialog: But why Palmer and not you? If you
dialog: orchestrated the raids...
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: (defensive, a sore spot)
dialog: I was only twenty four years old. I
dialog: was following orders, Agent Smith.
speaker_heading: YOUNG FBI MAN
dialog: (regretting the question)
dialog: I understand, sir.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: But If we hadn’t of done it, you may
dialog: very well have been born into a
dialog: communist State instead of the
dialog: country you love today, am I right?
speaker_heading: YOUNG FBI MAN
dialog: Of course, sir.
text: A door opens across the hall. Hoover looks up and sees the
text: earlier silhouette again limping toward his glass back door.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN’S VOICE
dialog: Edgar?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: (quietly to Agent Smith)
dialog: Ignore him.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN’S VOICE
dialog: Edgar!
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Mr. Toulson! I will be out ina
dialog: moment. I am in a meeting.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN’S VOICE
dialog: Don’t forget your appointment with
dialog: the Attorney General, Edgar.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: The file is not complete yet, Mr.
dialog: Toulson. Go away!
text: The casual familiarity of the exchange in front of Agent
text: Smith bothers Hoover.
text: Smith is packing up. Hoover extends his hand for a shake,
text: apparently wanting to dispense with the earlier tension.
speaker_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: Thank you, sir. I apologize. I will
dialog: finish this chapter tonight.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Very good, Agent Smith.
text: The Agent goes. Hoover checks the hand he just shook with.
text: The young agent’s palm was sweaty. He seems heartbroken. He
dialog: had truly liked Agent Smith--
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY - 1964
text: Hoover is in his outer office with a new agent, AGENT JONES,
dialog: 22. He’s from Indiana. He’s by the books.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Say I wanted to include the story of
dialog: how I became director. Do they tell
dialog: that story in the Academy?
speaker_heading: AGENT JONES
dialog: Yes sir... You were called into the
dialog: new Attorney General’s office--
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Harlan Fiske Stone.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: AGENT JONES
dialog: Yes sir, Attorney General Stone. He
dialog: called you into his office and told
dialog: you to sit down, sir.
scene_heading: INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE - 1924 - DAY
text: Young Edgar is let into HARLAN FISKE STONE’s office. Stone is
text: 60, an imposing figure at 6’6” and 260 lbs.
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: Sit down.
text: Edgar does. Stone examines him intently over his desk. Edgar
text: calms his nerves by manically talking business.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Sir, there are almost a dozen
dialog: vacancies in Chicago. With the
dialog: robbery rate rising it would
dialog: actually profit the bureau to fill
dialog: these vacancies and start making
dialog: recoveries. I have cabinets filled
text: with files on suspects, and with a
dialog: Congressional hearing--
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: Lower the treble, son. You didn’t
dialog: call this meeting. I did.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes, sir.
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: Everyone you’ve worked with here is
dialog: gone. And there’s a reason for
dialog: that. This Bureau is of exceedingly
dialog: bad odor. Would you agree?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes, sir.
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: And no offense, but you seem to
dialog: have no social life, no wife, no
dialog: girlfriend, and as far as I can
dialog: tell, no pals... at all.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: That’s accurate, sir.
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: And you’re shamelessly distracted
text: by this hodgepodge fingerprinting
dialog: affair.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: It wouldn’t be a hodgepodge if we
dialog: could centralize the prints here.
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: It’s a speculative science at best.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes, sir.
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: And why do they call you “Speed?”
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Who calls me that?
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: They all do... Behind your back
dialog: evidently.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (unaware, covering)
dialog: Well... S- S- Sir, I earned a
dialog: reputation for delivering groceries
dialog: when I was ten years old. I was the
dialog: fastest in the neighborhood. It was
dialog: a nickname.
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: Are you sure it’s not for the way
dialog: you talk?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Perhaps, sir.
text: A long beat of silence. Edgar is ready and willing to be
dialog: fired -- if only to stop the humiliation. Instead:
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: Young man, I want you to be acting
dialog: director of the Bureau of
dialog: Investigation.
text: Edgar absorbs the unexpected good news, covers his shock, and
text: looks back across the desk at Stone’s imposing forehead.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I’1l take the job, Mr. Stone... But
dialog: only on certain conditions.
text: Stone gives a quizzical look. How dare he name conditions?
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: What are they?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (as if prepared)
dialog: The Bureau must be divorced from
dialog: politics, and not be a catch-all
dialog: for political hacks. Recruits must
dialog: be college educated. Appointments
dialog: must be based on merit. Promotions
dialog: will be made only on proven
dialog: ability... And the bureau will be
dialog: responsible only to you sir, the
dialog: Attorney General.
scene_heading: HARLAN FISKE STONE
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: I wouldn’t give you the job under
dialog: any other conditions...
dialog: (cutting Edgar off)
dialog: That’s all. Good day.
scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE / FBI OFFICE - 1930
text: All of the agents in the FBI are lined up in two long, never
text: ending rows, facing each other. Edgar walks down the long
text: isle between them, shaking each Agent’s hand.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I am determined to summarily
dialog: dismiss from this Bureau any
dialog: employee whom I find indulging in
dialog: the use of intoxicants. I--
text: He gets to a chubby agent, shakes his hand. Sweat. He turns
text: to Helen beside him. She takes note. He continues, indicating
text: each man with a bald spot, each man not neatly dressed.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: --believe that when a man becomes a
dialog: part of this Bureau, he must so
dialog: conduct himself, both officially
dialog: and unofficially, as to eliminate
dialog: the slightest possibility of
dialog: criticism as to his conduct...
dialog: 28.
text: He stops at a handsome linebacker of an agent with dark hair,
scene_heading: RAYMOND CAFFREY, 29.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: And your name, Sir?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND CAFFREY
dialog: Agent Caffrey, Sir.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: What is your assignment?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND CAFFREY
dialog: Special Agent to Kansas City,
text: aiding in the search for escaped
dialog: murdered Frank Nash, Sir.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: It’s dangerous work. But when you
dialog: return, you will be rewarded for
dialog: you service to our country.
text: Edgar shakes his hand. This is the kind of Agent he wants in
text: his Bureau (and his dinner table). Next to him though is the
text: MUSTACHED AGENT who challenged Edgar during the Palmer raids.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: You still fancy facial hair, Agent
dialog: Stokes?
scene_heading: MUSTACHED AGENT
dialog: The ladies appreciate it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: And the ladies’ opinions’ are more
dialog: important than the Bureau’s?
scene_heading: MUSTACHED AGENT
dialog: No... sir.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Mr. Stokes, perhaps you are better
dialog: suited for the Police force than
dialog: the Bureau of Investigations.
scene_heading: MUSTACHED AGENT
dialog: I’ve been here seven years, Edgar.
dialog: As long as you.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: No. You were with the old bureau
dialog: seven years. That bureau is gone.
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT BED - (HOOVER’S MIND?)
text: Edgar stands above his emaciated father, examining him with
text: scientific curiosity. The man’s eyes open wide, lock on his
text: son and he lets out a TERRIFYING SCREAM. Edgar bears it.
text: Silence. His father dies, his jaw still ajar, mid scream.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME / HOOVER’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: A WORKMAN is installing a personal telephone line into
text: Edgar’s childhood (and current) bedroom. Dressed all in
text: black, Edgar supervises from the doorway.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: Why the phone in your son’s room
dialog: and not in the master bedroom?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I’m paying you to put in a line,
dialog: not ask questions.
text: And Edgar pulls out a pack of LUCKY STRIKES.
scene_heading: EXT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME / FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
text: Edgar and his NEICE, 12 (also in black), are smoking.
speaker_heading: YOUNG NEICE
dialog: I thought Lucky Strikes were only
dialog: for girls.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: You thought wrong. Hold it in your
dialog: lungs or it’ll do you no good.
text: Bouncing up the street in a bonnet holding a mass of shopping
text: bags (and not in black at all) is Edgar’s mother.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME / KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT
text: Edgar’s mother spins around in a new dress.
scene_heading: HOOVER'S MOTHER
dialog: I had two made. Same cut, different
dialog: pattern. And two suits for you.
dialog: They'll be delivered on Friday.
text: Edgar sits down at the dinner table. At his place is a
text: sapphire ring. He examines it. She cozies up.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: It’s platinum. Six diamonds and a
dialog: star sapphire. I’ve told everyone
text: in the neighborhood. They all know.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: What about the funeral for father?
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: (serves up some pot roast)
dialog: There’s no time for that now.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I shouldn’t mother. I’ve been
dialog: gaining weight.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
text: It’s solid weight. There’s nothing
text: wrong with solid weight on a man.
dialog: I’m so incredibly proud of you,
dialog: Edgar
text: She pulls out a clipped newspaper article. It’s small, barely
text: a mention, but it announces his new job.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m starting an album for you. I’m
dialog: going to put everything in it. This
text: is just the beginning.
text: He slips the sapphire ring on his finger -- where it will
dialog: remain the rest of his life.
scene_heading: INT. MAYFLOWER HOTEL / LOUNGE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Edgar holds court at his corner table with SPECIAL AGENT
text: CHARLES APPEL and another handsome agent. The wait staff pays
text: them special attention, but Edgar doesn’t notice. He has his
text: eye on a GROUP OF YOUNG MEN celebrating at the bar.
text: Edgar is focused on a tall, slender, SHARPLY DRESSED MAN.
text: Trouble is, another man in the group, LAWRENCE RICHEY, knows
text: Edgar, and waves. Edgar returns the gesture, but feels
text: caught. His discomfort doubles when Richey heads toward him --
scene_heading: THE SHARPLY DRESSED MAN JUST BEHIND (CLYDE TOULSON, 28).
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE RICHEY
dialog: Mr. Hoover! Good to see you. I'd
dialog: like to introduce you to Mr. Clyde
dialog: Toulson. He graduated from George
dialog: Washington University Tonight. With
dialog: a law degree.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Congratulations, Mr. Toulson.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: (the quiet type)
dialog: Thank you. I believe you’re one of
dialog: our most distinguished Alumni.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I did... yes... I do... have a
dialog: degree from the school. Yes.
dialog: (an awkward beat; covering)
dialog: I was just admiring your suit, Mr.
dialog: Toulson. You could take a lesson
dialog: from him, Lawrence.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: It’s a custom cut. From Garfinkel’s
dialog: Department store, sir.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Do you have a card, Mr. Toulson?
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: I do. Of course.
text: Clyde hands his card to Edgar. Edgar looks it over, hands
text: Clyde his own card, and just as quickly goes back to his meal
dialog: -- as if he never paid Clyde any special attention.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON (CONT’D)
dialog: Thank you, sir.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
text: Helen and Edgar are going through applications. One pile for
text: interviews, one for rejects. The reject pile is stacked high.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: (redacting an application)
dialog: Well educated. Highly recommended.
dialog: Willing to guarantee five years
dialog: service... Has a family in New
dialog: York... And a new baby.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: No interview.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: The family in New York or the baby?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Five years is not enough. We want
dialog: men willing to dedicate their
dialog: lives. How many is that so far?
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: 320 denied, and 21 interviews.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Did you receive an application from
dialog: a Mr. Toulson?
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: (finds the report, wary)
dialog: Yes... His report states he, “has
dialog: confidence, poise, his diction is
dialog: excellent.” But, “Although
dialog: physically fitted for it, might be
dialog: displeased with rugged work.” His
dialog: only interest in the Bureau is to
dialog: gain experience that would benefit
dialog: a private law practice. And he has
dialog: no interest in being here for any
dialog: period of time, which would,
dialog: “Render employment speculative.”
text: She waits for him to say “No interview,” but he doesn’t.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: He did receive a letter of
dialog: recommendation from the executive
dialog: assistant of the Secretary of War.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: That’s fantastic, Miss Gandy.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: He, well... mentions here that Mr.
dialog: Toulson, “Showed no particular
dialog: interest in women.”
text: It’s 1930’s code for gay. She offers a bright side.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY (CONT’D)

dialog: excel because they have... no
text: family incumbrance.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: You're right. Bring him in for an
dialog: interview.
dialog: 33.
text: Helen adds him to the yes stack. Edgar tries to change the
dialog: subject.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: The problem, Miss Gandy, is that
dialog: these men don’t look up to me.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: Of course they do.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I don’t mean figuratively. I mean.
dialog: They don’t look UP to me.
dialog: He doesn’t want to be any clearer than that. It’s too
dialog: sensitive a subject -- he’s shorter than most.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: Well... if you could conduct the
dialog: entire interview from behind your
dialog: desk instead of walking about the
dialog: office, I could correct that.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (considers it, then:)
dialog: Miss Gandy, say I had private
dialog: information on someone in a position
dialog: of power. Harmful information... Now
dialog: Destroying information goes against
dialog: my nature, but I don’t trust it in
dialog: the general files either. Could I
dialog: trust it with you? If we created a
dialog: confidential file?
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: Of course, Edgar.
text: And with that, he slides his first “Private and Confidential”
text: file across his desk to her. IT’S MARKED “ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.”
text: She sets it carefully in her lap.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY'S OFFICE - DAY - 1964
text: OLD Miss Gandy sits outside the A.G.’s office with A STACK OF
text: SIMILAR FILES IN HER LAP. She patronizes ROBERT KENNEDY'S
text: SECRETARY with a smile.
dialog: 34.
scene_heading: INT. ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY’S OFFICE - SAME TIME
text: Kennedy stands by a window, pensive. A FILE sits casually on
text: the corner of his desk. Hoover is relaxed in a chair, focused
text: on a FIREPLACE in the office. He breaks the silence:
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Was the fireplace always here or
dialog: did you have it put in?
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: It was put in... What were you
dialog: doing with wire-taps in that house?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: You asked that I pursue this
dialog: “Organized Crime” element, Mr.
dialog: Kennedy, and that’s what I did.
dialog: With diligence... Do you use the
dialog: fireplace?
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: Rarely... Who else has heard the
dialog: recording?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: I’ve filed this matter “Personal
dialog: and Confidential” I’m the only one
dialog: with access to it.
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: Mr. Hoover, I asked you to pursue a
dialog: real threat. Instead you have
dialog: publicly denied the existence of
dialog: Organized Crime, and now this gross
dialog: display of intimidation.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Sir, I was only following orders.
text: We bugged the basement of a home in
dialog: Los Angeles that is a known
text: gathering place for lawbreakers.
dialog: How was I to know that a criminal’s
dialog: girlfriend and an east German
dialog: communist would be down there
dialog: having sex with your brother, the
dialog: President of the United States. Do
dialog: not shoot the messenger, sir. I am
dialog: here to protect you both.
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: What do you want from me?
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: If this information was discovered
dialog: by the public it would create wide
dialog: spread distrust in your brother’s
dialog: leadership ability, and before all
dialog: else, I hold the well being of our
dialog: Country paramount.
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: So how may I HELP you, Mr. Hoover?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: If I am to pursue the elements you
dialog: consider a threat, I humbly request
dialog: that you allow me the same power
dialog: and access to follow the groups I
text: see as IMMEDIATE threats.
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: It’s not 1920 anymore.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Do you know who Stanley Levinson is?
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: A lawyer.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
text: A white communist lawyer who is
text: organizing at the highest levels.
dialog: Including the SCLC. His group is
dialog: growing, their aim is entirely self
dialog: serving, and their leadership is
dialog: openly critical of this Department.
dialog: Have you read the clippings I sent?
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: I can’t say I have.
text: Hoover pulls out the critical newspaper clippings (the ones
text: that made him sweat in the opening scene).
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: They claim we are, “Unable to get
dialog: convictions in even the most
dialog: heinous crimes,” and that we have,
dialog: “Faltered under the pressure,
dialog: complexities and responsibilities
dialog: of our office.” In PRINT in the New
dialog: York Times.
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: You can’t bear a little criticism?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: It depends on what their aim is...
dialog: They are gaining considerable
dialog: power, their priorities are
dialog: singularly focused on their own
dialog: issues, and they are trying to
dialog: incite revolt.
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: Frankly, they sounds more critical
dialog: of your office than mine... There’s
dialog: a new face to communism, Edgar, and
dialog: this isn’t it. Communism is a
text: foreign threat now. Not domestic.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Mr. Kennedy. Before you were even
dialog: born, I heard that very same
dialog: argument from a Mr. Mitchell
dialog: Palmer. And do you know what it
dialog: took to change his mind? A bomb. If
text: he had sat in his smoking chair
dialog: five more minutes that night in
dialog: 1919, we would have been lucky to
text: have found an intact index finger.
dialog: I do not want to see that happen to
dialog: you, or your brother.
dialog: (attempting a conciliatory tone)
dialog: There’s no reason we can’t both get
dialog: what we want. We can wage a war on
dialog: two fronts, sir.
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: You can go now. And please leave
dialog: the transcripts with me.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Yes sir. Feel free to share them
dialog: with your brother. I have a copy of
dialog: my own, in safe keeping.
text: And with that threat, Hoover walks toward the door, stops at
text: the fireplace, inspects it, and goes, a smile creeping into
text: the corners of his mouth. The rhythm of his shoes on the
text: flooring cross the cut, matching the rhythm of--
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY - 1924
text: --Young Edgar doing push ups in his office with the window
text: open to let in air and dry his brow. FOOTSTEPS!
text: Edgar takes a handkerchief from his pocket and dabs his brow,
text: but he’s not sweating.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: MISS GANDY
dialog: Your four o’clock is here, sir.
text: He hurries to close the window, but the curtain gets stuck,
text: the window jams, and the handkerchief falls from his pocket.
text: He heads for his desk. His office door opens. Miss Gandy lets
text: in the next applicant, it’s dapper Clyde Toulson (earlier).
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Have a seat, Mr. Toulson.
text: Edgar rounds his desk and STEPS UP ONTO A NEW SMALL PLATFORM
text: TO MAKE HIM TALLER. Clyde smiles, trying to relieve Edgar’s
text: embarrassment. He steps toward the desk and extends a hand.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Mr. Hoover, thank you for this
dialog: opportunity.
text: A SIDE SHOT reveals Edgar standing on his riser, still not
text: quite as tall as Clyde. They shake hands.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Please. Take a seat.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: There are several problems with
dialog: your application, Mr. Toulson, not
dialog: the least of which is you do not
dialog: show the required dedication to the
dialog: bureau, nor the dedication t--
text: As Edgar rattles, he watches Clyde’s eyes. Clyde sees the
text: curtain stuck in the window. He sees the handkerchief on the
text: floor, and the spot of sweat forming on Edgar’s brow.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: --t--t--to... th--
dialog: (speeds up to stop stuttering)
dialog: the protection of the American
dialog: people and the American way. This
dialog: is NO platform to a fatter paycheck
dialog: in private practice.
text: We see what Edgar sees: LIGHT STRINGS connect the evidence
text: Clyde is looking at. It seems to Edgar that Clyde can see the
text: strings as well. It’s frightening, invasive, titillating --
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: Is there something the matter, Mr.
dialog: Toulson?
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Is exercise a requirement for all
dialog: Agent’s, Mr. Hoover?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (busted? )
dialog: All agents must be in excellent
dialog: physical condition. We must out
dialog: Match and out wit the public enemy
dialog: at every turn.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: What kind of routine do you do?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (making it up)
text: sit ups... push ups... squatting...
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: How about chin ups?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes. Of course.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: I see. Would you like me to fix the
dialog: curtain, Mr. Hoover? Or perhaps
dialog: open the window? I always enjoy the
dialog: air after exercise. Don’t you, sir?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: If it would please you.
text: And Clyde carefully and expertly removes the curtain from the
text: window, bends over, plucks up the handkerchief off the floor,
text: and returns it to Edgar's desk.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Where I may fall short in terms of
dialog: resume, I apparently far exceed the
dialog: rest in terms of honesty. I did not
dialog: lie to get this interview. Like the
dialog: rest, I WOULD like to start a
dialog: private practice eventually, but I
dialog: could be persuaded otherwise if the
dialog: right opportunity arose.
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: EXT. GARFINKEL’S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
text: Edgar steps out of a limousine and walks into the department
text: store. Clyde gets out behind him and follows him in.
scene_heading: INT. GARFINKEL’S DEPARTMENT STORE / MONTAGE - DAY
text: Edgar is measured for a suit -- Clyde supervises fabric
text: choices -- Clyde pulls out ties and shoes -- Edgar tries on a
text: 3-PIECE-SUIT. It’s the first time we’ve seen him this put
text: together. He looks like the “Hoover” the world now knows.
scene_heading: INT. GARFINKEL’S DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER
text: Edgar is with a clerk, his items laid out on a counter. Clyde
text: is at a remove. Something’s wrong. Things get uncomfortable
text: when the department store CREDIT DIRECTOR appears.
speaker_heading: CREDIT DIRECTOR
dialog: Are you Mr. John Hoover?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I am. Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: CREDIT DIRECTOR
dialog: It seems there’s a Mr. John Hoover
dialog: whose credit has gone bad with us.
dialog: That would appear to be you.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (quiet, humiliated)
dialog: That’s not me. On my word. My
dialog: parents call me Edgar, my niece
dialog: calls me J.E. And I sign John E,
dialog: not John.
speaker_heading: CREDIT DIRECTOR
dialog: Sir, may I suggest you choose ONE
dialog: name, and re-apply.
text: He presents a new application. Edgar looks at the blank NAME
text: SPACE. He puts a pen to the page, and writes. “J. -- EDGAR --
text: HOOVER.” The camera focuses in on the soon to be famous name.
scene_heading: INT. HELEN GANDY’S OFFICE — DAY
text: Edgar walks in wearing his new 3-piece-suit with a pocket
dialog: square -- the more dapper look he’1ll carry the rest of his
text: life. Helen Gandy greets him with a grim face.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: You don’t like it?
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: Mr. Hoover. There’s been a massacre
dialog: in Kansas City.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: One of ours?
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (his worst fear)
dialog: Special Agent Caffrey?
scene_heading: EXT. KANSAS CITY TRAIN STATION (FLASHBACK) - DAY
text: GUN FIRE AND SMOKE. Cars screech to a halt. Passengers run
text: for their lives. Police officers scramble for cover.
speaker_heading: A VOICE
dialog: Let ‘em have it!
text: A MAN WITH A MACHINE GUN beside a Plymouth starts firing on
text: two officers. Another gangster behind a second car opens
text: fire. The two cops immediately fall to the ground, dead.
text: A MAN catches a bullet in his arm. He drops to the ground and
text: scrambles to the side of a Chevy, TOWARD AGENT CAFFREY(The
text: dark haired linebacker of an agent Edgar complimented
dialog: earlier).
text: Caffrey scrambles to the driver’s side of his Chevrolet to
text: provide safe haven for the wounded man, but he’s cut short as
text: A BULLET BLASTS THROUGH HIS HEAD.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: By 1930, The communist threat had
dialog: been beaten back, but--
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - 1930 - DAY
text: A MOVIE CREW has lit Edgar’s office. Clyde is by a window
text: dressed as an FBI Agent. It’s sexy on him.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: --the depression had hit, and their
text: was a new threat. The bank robber,
text: the car thief and the kidnapper.
dialog: But like communism, America didn’t
dialog: react with scorn, they gave the
dialog: American gangster their admiration.
dialog: 4l.
text: Edgar is in his new suit behind his desk. Two flags flank it,
text: making the perfect stage. A makeup woman powders his nose.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Whenever you’re ready, sir.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Our nation is under attack from
dialog: within. The problem of organized
dialog: gang warfare and the defiance by

scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER / CHICAGO - 1930 - NIGHT

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: --Pretty Boy Floyd is now Public
dialog: Enemy Number one. Look around you.
dialog: He could be anywhere. With your
dialog: help, the American gangster’s days
dialog: are numbered.
dialog: The Audience is none too pleased with Edgar’s announcement:
text: Boos, popcorn at the screen. The projectionist cuts it short.
text: A trailer fades in. It’s PUBLIC ENEMY starring JAMES CAGNEY
text: as the dashing gangster. THE AUDIENCE ERUPTS WITH APPLAUSE!!
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY - 1964
text: Old Hoover is again talking to Agent Jones -- who is more
text: focused on the WORKMEN DEMOLISHING HOOVER’S BACK WALL.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: But that summer, a single crime
dialog: opened the door to set things
dialog: right. Do you know what that was,
dialog: Mr. Jones?
speaker_heading: AGENT JONES
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: I’m sorry, sir, what was that?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Who is the most famous man of the
dialog: 20th Century... thus far?
speaker_heading: AGENT JONES
dialog: Joe McCarthy, sir?
dialog: 42.
text: Hoover clearly disapproves. This guy is toast.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY - 1964
text: Old Hoover has a new, VERY SWEATY AGENT, at the typewriter.
scene_heading: SWEATY BALDING AGENT
dialog: The most famous? Is that you, sir?
text: Hoover is focused on the bald spot forming on the crown of
text: the Agent’s head. That and the sweat are deal breakers.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY - 1964
text: Hoover is with yet another Agent, AGENT GARRISON. This one is
text: very young and handsome with a North Carolina accent.
speaker_heading: AGENT GARRISON
dialog: Well I suppose his notoriety
dialog: depends on the field he is in.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: His field... was in the clouds.
speaker_heading: AGENT GARRISON
dialog: Then Charles Lindbergh, sir.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME / HOOVER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT -1932
text: The private phone (earlier) rings. It’s 11PM. Edgar is in his

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes?... Send officers from Trenton.
dialog: I will be on the first train.
text: His mother comes in. He hangs up. He looks truly disturbed.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: The Lindbergh’s baby has been

speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: (deeply shocked)
dialog: You have to find him, Edgar. He has

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes, mother.
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LINBERG’S HOME / NEW JERSEY - DAYBREAK
text: Edgar and Clyde arrive at the Lindbergh home, a big white
text: house in the middle of a field. All around are POLICE CARS
text: and GIANT LAMPS that must have burnt all night.
text: Like the Palmer crime scene, Edgar looks for clues, little
text: LIGHT STRINGS making connections. AN OFFICER talks AT Clyde:
speaker_heading: NJ OFFICER
dialog: This morning alone we’ve heard from
dialog: the Pennsylvania railroad, Will
dialog: Rogers, President Hoover, Governor
dialog: Roosevelt, the Customs Department,
dialog: the U.S. Mail and the Boy Scouts--
text: EDGAR WATCHES THE NJ POLICE trudge around an area under an
text: opened upstairs window. He shouts out.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: All of you. Get off of that dirt.
dialog: You are trampling evidence.
text: Colonel Shwartzkoff (clearly the one in charge) approaches:
speaker_heading: COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
dialog: There’s nothing there. No defined
text: footprints. It seems he was wearing
text: fabric on his shoes.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: And you don’t think the size of the
dialog: print may have held some value?
dialog: (re: the upstairs window)
dialog: And how did he get up there? Are
text: there marks on the window and wall
dialog: you're erasing as well?
speaker_heading: COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
dialog: There was a ladder. We found it a
text: hundred yards away in three pieces.
dialog: We moved it inside.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: You moved it?
speaker_heading: COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
dialog: Yes. For safe keeping.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Congratulations. You’ve completely
dialog: contaminated the crime scene. Now
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: if you please, get your boots off
dialog: of this property, Mr. Shwartzkoff.
speaker_heading: OFFICER SHWARTKOFF
dialog: What right do you have to be here,
dialog: Mr...
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: J. Edgar Hoover. Director of the
dialog: FBI. We have been sent by President
dialog: Hoover himself to make sure this
text: crime is resolved successfully.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: The President has authorized access
dialog: to all documents and evidence--
speaker_heading: OFFICER SHWARTKOFF
dialog: Mr. Hoover, you are free to
dialog: observe, but New Jersey is not the
dialog: President’s domain.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Where is Mr. Lindbergh? I’d like to
dialog: hear his opinion on the matter.
scene_heading: INT. THE LINDBERGH HOME / GARAGE - LATER
text: Surrounded by workmen installing a bank of phone lines, Edgar
text: hovers over THE LADDER: it’s home-made, each of it’s three
text: pieces measure 80.5 inches. We see Edgar’s LIT STRINGS as he
dialog: makes connections -- the sections must have fit neatly into
text: each other to form a 20 foot ladder that would collapse to 6.
text: A side-rail on the center section has split along the grain.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
text: He fell five feet.
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: Who did?
text: Reveal CHARLES LINDBERGH, dressed well, but bearing the signs
text: of no sleep. He seems interested in what Edgar has to say.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
text: The kidnapper... with the child in
dialog: his arms, sir.
speaker_heading: COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
dialog: That’s speculation, Mr. Hoover.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Mr. Lindbergh, sir, if it had split
dialog: on the way up, it would have
text: collapsed. It was a miscalculation.
text: Built to bear the weight of a man
text: going up, but not the weight of a
text: man and a child coming down.
speaker_heading: COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
dialog: We have other theories.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (annoyed, but careful in
dialog: front of Lindbergh)
dialog: And the ransom note? May I see the
dialog: note please, Mr. Shwartzkoff?
text: Shwartzcoff pulls it out and hesitantly offers it up.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: You’ve been touching it with your
dialog: bare hands as well?
speaker_heading: OFFICER SHWARTKOFF
dialog: We checked. There were none of the
dialog: “finger imprints” you fancy so
dialog: valuable, Mr. Hoover.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: None YOU could find perhaps. Would
dialog: you please put it down?
text: A moment of eye contact between Edgar and Lindbergh, then as
text: Edgar reads it, we see all the clues: the distinct spacing,
text: spelling and grammar GLOWING IN HOOVER’S TRADEMARK MANNER.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: “Have 50,00$ redy. we will inform
dialog: you were to deliver the Mony. We

dialog: N-G SING-nature “And 3 holes.”
text: And the camera zeros in on the THREE HOLED SYMBOL the

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: I want this letter. And the ladder.
speaker_heading: COLONEL SHWARTKOFF
dialog: (leans in close)
dialog: There is no Federal jurisdiction
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: COLONEL SHWARTKOFF (CONT'D)
dialog: here. I’ve shown you what you asked
dialog: for. It’s time for you to go.
text: Edgar looks to Lindbergh who is examining the letter now. He

scene_heading: EXT. LINDBERGH’S HOME / HOOVER’S CAR - LATER
text: Edgar and Clyde get back in their car.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I’m afraid for his boy.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: He trusts the local police more
dialog: than us.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: No. He thinks we’re ALL fools.
dialog: He’1ll go around them too. He’1l1
text: bargain with the kidnappers.
scene_heading: INT. U.S. CONGRESS -— DAY
text: Edgar sits with Clyde before a Senate Committee. He’s a
text: brilliant speaker, never looking down, never pausing.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: President Hoover called me the
dialog: morning the child was taken and
dialog: asked that I do whatever was in my
dialog: power to help solve this crime. But
dialog: do you know what ALL OF THE POWER
dialog: OF THE FBI means without federal
dialog: laws? Without arms? Without the
dialog: power to make arrests? It means
dialog: nothing. If we are one nation under
dialog: God then we should have a force
dialog: that can aid every state in this
dialog: nation and stop the wave of crime
dialog: that is pulling us into chaos. Mr.
dialog: Chairman, I urge passage of the
dialog: Lindbergh Law, making kidnapping a
dialog: FEDERAL offense. To immediately
dialog: deliver every finger print in the
dialog: country to my office so that we may
dialog: have a central file. To arm our
dialog: agents so that we have a fighting
dialog: chance against their sub-machine
dialog: guns. I urge you to do this in the
dialog: name of little Lindy. Because if he
dialog: can be taken, then what child is
dialog: safe? And if we cannot aid in his
dialog: safe return, then what use are we?
dialog: 47.
text: It’s a smashing success of a speech.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE - DAY
text: Edgar watches from a window as trucks in the courtyard unload

speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: What is it, Edgar?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: The rest of the Fingerprints from
dialog: Leavenworth and Chicago.
text: She waits. He turns. That’s not what she meant.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: Our new President has scheduled a

speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: I’ve heard similar whispers.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Do you remember the file we built
dialog: on his wife, Miss Gandy? Would you
dialog: make a copy for me?
text: He looks out the window and steps out onto the balcony.
scene_heading: EXT. HOOVER’S BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
text: Edgar puts on a big smile. Down below on Pennsylvania Avenue

text: Roosevelt as his car passes, then heads back inside
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER'S INNER OFFICE - (APPARENTLY CONTINUOUS) - 1964
text: As if a continuous (but 32 years later) Hoover comes in off

text: at the far end are now building the FACADE OF A NEW
text: FIREPLACE. It looks identical to Kennedy's.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Lindbergh hired criminals to look
dialog: for his son. He even got an offer
dialog: from Al Capone to help pay the
dialog: ransom. And he employed an eccentric
dialog: by the name of John Condon who'd
dialog: placed a newspaper ad to act as a go-

speaker_heading: AGENT GARRISON
dialog: Was Condon a criminal too?
scene_heading: INT. THE LINDBERGH HOME / NURSERY - NIGHT - 1932
text: A white haired JOHN CONDON is escorted in and up to Lindy’s

text: Mr. Lindbergh walks into the room.
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: Mr. Condon? You say the kidnappers
dialog: responded to your ads?
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: (hands over two letters)
dialog: Twice now. I will reply in the

dialog: he leave the note in the crib?
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
text: No. On the window sill.
text: Condon looks at the pins securing the blankets in the crib.
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: These pins are unique.
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: My wife uses them to hold the

speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: Can I take them with me?
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: (not sure of this man)
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: So a mother may have her child

scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: How do we know these letters of

dialog: What is it Mr. Lindbergh?
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: In a moment of thoughtlessness, I
dialog: showed the symbol to some other men
dialog: who had offered to help. I’m not
dialog: sure they were trustworthy. I’m not
dialog: sure anyone is trustworthy anymore,
dialog: Mr. Condon. You should know that I
dialog: have decided to have your letters
dialog: analyzed to see if they are truly
dialog: from the same author.
scene_heading: INT. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S PRIVATE LIBRARY - DAY
text: Edgar storms into a law book jammed room with a studious
text: looking man, MR. ALBERT S. OSBORNE, and several agents.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Clear all of these tables.
speaker_heading: YOUNG AGENT
dialog: Where do we put the books, sir?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Out of my sight... Mr. Osborne,
dialog: what do you need from us?
speaker_heading: ALBERT S. OSBORNE
text: Bright lights. A microscope.
dialog: Measuring instruments. Magnifying
dialog: glasses... a projector.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: You have the full resources of the
dialog: Bureau. Don’t be shy, a child’s
dialog: life depends on this.
speaker_heading: ALBERT S. OSBORNE
dialog: Okay. Paper samples... from every
dialog: regional manufacturer.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Mr. Toulson, you will get Mr.
dialog: Osborne whatever he needs to
dialog: conclude without a doubt that these
dialog: letters come from the same author.
dialog: 50.
text: And with that, Edgar puts the three Lindbergh notes on the
text: now book cleared table. Lindbergh has handed them over.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL’S PRIVATE LIBRARY - LATER
text: Clyde stands with an impatient Edgar, outside the makeshift
text: lab. A SIGN indicates this is the Attorney General’s library.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Should we tell the Attorney General?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: So he can say “no” for the third
dialog: time? Just post a sign.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: To say what... “Keep out?”
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: No. “FBI Crime Laboratory.” Have it
text: carved in wood and nailed in. If he
dialog: wants it gone, he can pull it out
dialog: himself. It’s time we have at least
dialog: one thing the bad guys don’t.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Decorating skills?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Science, Clyde.
text: Albert Osborne walks out of his lab. Edgar perks up.
speaker_heading: ALBERT S. OSBORNE
dialog: The ink is different, but the
dialog: handwriting is a match. Whoever Mr.
dialog: Condon is corresponding with IS the
dialog: person who wrote the original note.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: OR... Condon wrote all the notes
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Lindbergh is planning to deliver
dialog: the ransom money through Condon. It
dialog: may have already happened.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Call the Internal Revenue Service.
dialog: Get them to Lindbergh’s home. I
dialog: insist those bills be marked.
dialog: Sl.
text: Edgar starts down the hall. Albert stops him with:
speaker_heading: ALBERT S. OSBORNE
dialog: Is that all, Mr. Hoover? I have a
text: 2:30PM class to teach.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: No you don’t. Consider your pay

scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD GATES / JEROME AVENUE - NIGHT
text: Condon waits at the FRONT GATE rereading his instructions.
text: A MAN approaches, but walks right by. Condon checks his
text: watch: 9:15 PM. He considers, then starts to leave. As he
text: does, he sees a WHITE HANDKERCHIEF being waved from inside
text: the cemetary through the bars of the gate.
text: Condon approaches. The man is in an overcoat with a fedora
text: covering his eyes, the handkerchief now over his nose and
text: mouth. Each time Condon nears, he darts behind a gravestone,
text: pulling Condon deeper and deeper into the graveyard. Finally
text: the man shouts out in a German accent:
scene_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
dialog: Have you gotted the money?
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: I can’t bring the money until I’ve
dialog: seen the baby.
text: Both men hear FOOTSTEPS. The man jumps a fence and runs.
speaker_heading: CONDON (CONT'D)
dialog: I promise you there are no police.
scene_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
text: (shouts back as he runs)
dialog: It’s too dangerous.
text: The footsteps turn out to be those of a NIGHT GUARD. Condon
text: waits for him to pass, then pursues the man deep into the
text: park. Out of breath, and ready to collapse, Condon slows his
text: pace. So does the man with the handkerchief.
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: No one will hurt you.
scene_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
dialog: If they catch me they will.
dialog: He slowly
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: They only want the child.
scene_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
dialog: They’1l give me thirty years if I’m
dialog: caught. They could burn me.
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: No.
scene_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
dialog: I didn’t do it. I am only the
dialog: messenger.
text: approaches Condon. Condon braces himself.
speaker_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD (CONT’D)
dialog: What if the baby is dead? Would I
dialog: burn if the baby is dead?
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: Why would we be meeting if the baby
dialog: was dead?
scene_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
dialog: He’s not. He’s treated well. Better
dialog: than the diet in the newspaper ad
dialog: his mother put down. But would I
dialog: burn if I did not kill it?
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: No... And you’ve seen the child?
scene_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
dialog: You gotted my letter with the
dialog: sINGnature. It is the same like the
dialog: letter with the SINGnature which
text: was left in the baby’s crib.
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: In the crib?
scene_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
dialog: Yes.
text: Condon was told differently. He pulls the pins from the
text: baby’s crib from his pocket.
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: Do you recognize these?
scene_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
text: Those are from the baby’s crib.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: So you were there. Yourself.
scene_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD
dialog: (feeling busted, he flees)
dialog: Place another ad in the paper when

text: And with that, the man vanishes.
scene_heading: INT. LINDBERGH’S HOME / GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Condon and Lindbergh are with an officious little IRS man,

scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: I thought gold notes were going out
dialog: of circulation, Mr. Irey.
speaker_heading: ELMER IREY
dialog: That’s our hope. It will make these
text: bills more identifiable.
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: I have no need to pursue the money,
dialog: Mr. Hoover. I only want my son.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: This isn’t just for your Lindy,
dialog: sir. I’ve already assigned a 26 man
text: team, lead by Special Agent Sisk
dialog: here to pursue the case. If we let
dialog: these people go free, no child will
dialog: be safe.
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: If they find out you’re involved, I
dialog: may never see my son again.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: We won’t pursue a single lead until

dialog: You have my word.
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
text: Sitting in the audience, Edgar watches a newsreel fire up.
text: It’s a plea for the safe return of “Little Lindy” featuring

text: Edgar looks to his left, to his mother, a tear on her cheek.
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT
text: Edgar’s mother walks in, sits on the edge of Hoover’s bed,

speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: I had a nightmare, Edgar. That you
dialog: were covered in blood. That you had

scene_heading: EXT. NORTHERN TIP OF ST. RAYMOND’S CEMETARY - NIGHT
text: Condon walks alone. The night is dark, and there is only the

speaker_heading: MAN IN THE GRAVEYARD (V.O.)
dialog: Ay, Doctor.
text: REVEAL: This is Lindbergh’s POV from a Ford down the block.
text: He hears the voice. He watches Condon talk to the man from

scene_heading: EXT. A CITY STREET NEAR RAYMOND CEMETARY - LATER
text: Condon runs out of the cemetary, and up to the driver’s side

speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: I talked him out of 20,000 dollars.
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: I'd prefer him happy than save the

speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: I’m sorry, sir.
text: Lindbergh again sees the man with the handkerchief. This time
text: far in the distance. Lindbergh hands Condon the BOX OF MONEY.
text: LINDBERGH’S POV: Condon returns to the man, hands him the box
text: with his left hand and accepts an envelope with his right.
text: The man kneels down and inspects the money. Stands, shakes
text: Condon’s hand, blows his nose, drops the handkerchief and
text: disappears. Condon makes it back to the car.
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: The baby? Where is the baby?
speaker_heading: CONDON
dialog: (hands over the envelope)
dialog: I promised to wait six hours before

scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: Get in.
text: Condon gets in. They drive away in silence. Charles resists
text: opening the envelope, but he can’t. He tears it open.
speaker_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH (CONT'D)
dialog: You gave your word. I did not.
dialog: (reads the note)

speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: There was no boat. Lindbergh--
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER'S OUTER OFFICE - 1964
text: Hoover is with his writer.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: --didn’t trust us. He wanted to do

text: And at that moment, simultaneously, both the front and back

speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON

text: Hoover turns toward the voice. He reads Toulson’s face.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Agent Garrison. It’s time to go.
text: Garrison goes, but not before noting the familiarity between
text: Toulson and Hoover. Once alone with Toulson and Helen:
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: The Attorney General has authorized
dialog: your wire taps.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Very good, Miss Gandy.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: (not so pleased)
dialog: Are you sure you want this? Once
dialog: you do it... it’s done.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: And when I prove myself correct, we
dialog: will have saved this country
dialog: another radical revolution. History
dialog: will remember that.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: And if you’re wrong, history will
dialog: judge it an illegal move over a
dialog: petty grudge.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Is our reputation petty to you, Mr.
dialog: Toulson? Order the wires.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: Can we discuss it over dinner?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: After you order the wires.
text: He sees the tension in Hoover's face, the doubt. Helen goes.

scene_heading: PARKING LOT AGENT

scene_heading: CLYDE AND EDGAR -- WITH A FILE IN HAND.

scene_heading: INT. HARVEY’S RESTAURANT - THAT EVENING
text: An old world, elegant restaurant. The staff is immaculate.

scene_heading: INT. HARVEY’S RESTAURANT - LATER
text: Edgar and Clyde have settled in to their booth.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: It’s the same dance each time. They

dialog: sweating, that they’re showing me
dialog: who's boss. And I play along.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Did you play him the tape?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: No. The transcript. But he didn’t
dialog: want to read it. That was unique.
dialog: He wanted me to tell him about it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: How you came across it?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: No. I explained up front we had
dialog: never expected to find Mrs.

dialog: having what sounded like... an
dialog: intimate moment.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: (anxious laugh)
dialog: And that I needed his guidance in
dialog: how to proceed. I wanted him to
dialog: know he had an ally.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Before he had a chance to ask you
dialog: to resign.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Exactly, but when I was done, he
text: simply pushed the file aside. He
dialog: seemed unconcerned with it...
dialog: Clyde, The President of the United

speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Afraid of you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Of a potential invasion from abroad.
dialog: (to the passing Host)

speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: I'd like to think so.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (a big secret)
dialog: The President signed a secret order
dialog: granting me increased power of
dialog: surveillance. Secret surveillance
dialog: of Communists and Radicals. Without
dialog: warrant.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Is that legal?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: (off Clyde’s concern)

speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Vulgar.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Agreed.
dialog: (searching Clyde’s eyes)
dialog: I want to ask you something.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Feel free.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I need someone who understands

dialog: An Associate Director of the FBI...
dialog: I know you’ve only been with us 12
dialog: months...
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: +--almost 18.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (strangely intimate)
dialog: You're missing my point. Clyde, I

speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: I’m not one for the spotlight.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I need you, Clyde.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON

scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE / FBI OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Clyde has pulled the disinterested reporter aside for a

speaker_heading: REPORTER

speaker_heading: REPORTER

speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: (considers, then: )
dialog: With the inescapable demise of the

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: A story or a cover story?
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: I can’t promise a cover. But I have
dialog: a pal in the radio business if

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER

speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: He claims he can tell as much from

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER

speaker_heading: SENATOR MCKELLER
dialog: Mr. Hoover, is it true that you
dialog: directly or indirectly spend the
dialog: Bureau’s money on advertising?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: We are not permitted in any way to
dialog: engage in advertising, sir.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MCKELLER
dialog: But you take part, for instance, in
dialog: the making of radio shows and comic
dialog: books... I’ve seen several of these
dialog: “G-men” programs, and your picture
text: seems to be shown in conjunction
dialog: with them quite frequently.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (very uncomfortable)
dialog: We declined emphatically to lend
dialog: any form of endorsement and had
dialog: nothing to do with their
dialog: production, furnished no advice,
dialog: technical advice or other advice.
text: Clyde leans back and tries not to look shocked -- this was a
text: blatant lie. For the first time, Edgar starts to sweat.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MCKELLER
dialog: The very advertisement said the
dialog: broadcasts were, “True reflection,
dialog: as contained in the OFFICIAL
dialog: RECORDS... Based on actual cases
dialog: from the files of Federal Bureau of
dialog: Investigation, Saturday nights at 8
dialog: o'clock.”
dialog: (Edgar is speechless)
dialog: Mr. Hoover, what are your exact
dialog: qualifications for your leadership
dialog: position with this Bureau?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (his job now at risk)
dialog: 19 years with the Department of
dialog: Justice. 12 as Director.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MCKELLER
dialog: And in that time, have you EVER
dialog: Made an arrest, yourself?
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I have made investigations. I
dialog: administer many cases at once, Sir.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MCKELLER
dialog: That’s not what I asked. The comics
dialog: show you with a machine gun, making
dialog: arrests. Is that just fiction?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I am responsible for thousands of
dialog: arrests, sir.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MCKELLER
dialog: So you admit it’s PURE fiction. In
dialog: fact it wasn’t you who hunted and
dialog: captured John Dilinger at all. It
dialog: was Agent Purvis, is that correct?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I have been in charge of all of
dialog: these cases... but no sir, I have
dialog: not personally made an arrest.
text: Edgar’s blood is boiling, humiliated.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAPITOL - LATER
text: Edgar marches out, rambling at Clyde at a frantic pace.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: We spend our lives working for
dialog: justice, and the thanks we get is a
dialog: political attack. Would they rather
dialog: crimes go unsolved? Why is he
dialog: fighting me? Start a file on
dialog: Senator McKeller immediately. I
dialog: want three agents on him at all
dialog: times. Go through his trash.
dialog: Photograph him at every dinner.
text: Edgar arrives at his armored car and gets in. Clyde follows.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Get out. You can walk back.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: We have lunch. We don’t miss
dialog: lunches. No matter what. Remember?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: You pulled away from me in there.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: I’m sorry, Edgar, but it was a lie.
dialog: An easily provable one. If he had
dialog: pursued it, there’s no telling how
dialog: much worse it could have been.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (a beat, then)
text: Find out where Agent Purvis is. He
dialog: is to be demoted immediately, or
dialog: better yet, fired.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Firing the man who killed Dilinger
dialog: would be a PR disaster.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Then he’1ll spend the rest of his
dialog: career behind a desk. And tell him
dialog: if he wants to keep that job, he’d
dialog: best keep out of the papers.
text: Edgar shuts the door leaving Clyde on the sidewalk. The car
text: drives off. The “lunch promise” is already broken, but it’s
dialog: not the punishment Clyde took it as -- Edgar is breaking
text: down. He sets in on a panic attack.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT
text: Edgar sits next to his mother’s bed, soothing his woes with a

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I don’t know who to trust anymore,

dialog: Please, mother. We could go now.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: (barely a whisper)

scene_heading: INT. SMALL AIRPLANE TO NEW ORLEANS - DAY
text: The hum of the engines in mid air, Edgar, Clyde, and 12

speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: The arrest is mine to make,
dialog: understood? You will strictly
text: follow Agent Toulson’s orders.
dialog: (kissing up)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Agent Toulson is the finest agent
dialog: in the Bureau today. His worth is
dialog: second to none. In all of your
dialog: careers, you can only dream of
text: becoming half the agent he is now.
dialog: Listen to his every word.
text: The Agents nod out of duty. Toulson is uncomfortable.
scene_heading: EXT. GOOD LOOKING APARTMENT HOUSE / NEW ORLEANS STREET - DAY
text: The place is surrounded. Agents are poised on rooftops,
text: stairways, and in cars all watching the apartment’s door.
text: WE FOCUS ON: Edgar behind a car across the street, his gun at
text: his side. Clyde is a few cars up with his own.
text: Out comes a WELL DRESSED WOMAN. She steps down to the curb,
text: lights a cigarette and looks around. The officers make
text: themselves invisible, their fingers on their car keys and
text: guns, ready for a signal.
text: Edgar peaks up over his car as two men walk out of the
text: building behind her, FRED HUNTER and ALVIN KARPIS. Edgar eyes
text: Karpis and toys with his trigger. As the trio starts toward a
text: car, the street fills with TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIANS.
text: The woman gets in the car first. The AGENTS wait for Edgar to
text: make a move, but he’s focused on a MAN ON AN OLD WHITE HORSE
text: sauntering into the lane beside the through traffic. Clip-
text: clop, clip-clop, slowly clip-clopping past. Fred is now in
text: the driver seat, and Karpis is about to get in.
text: Finally, the horse moves past Edgar’s line of vision. REVEAL:
text: All three are in the car. Edgar throws a signal and all at
text: once, the AGENTS descend with sawed off shotguns: Off roofs,
text: down stairwells, their cars rushing in to block the street.
text: Edgar rushes across the street from his hiding place, his
text: heart pounding, Clyde a step behind. Karpis shuts his door.
text: An Agent busts the driver's window with his shotgun, and
text: points it at the driver’s head.
text: Edgar arrives, flings open the back door, and aims his gun at
text: Karpis’s head. On the seat beside him is A RIFLE.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
text: Put the handcuffs on him.
text: AN AGENT pulls off his necktie, and ties Karpis’s hands.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Karpis. You are under arrest.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN FRANCISCO / MONTAGE - DAY
text: A fast cut bust by “G-men” with guns of gangster William
text: Mahan in bed in the middle of the night. Edgar is there to
dialog: make the arrest.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING / FIRST FLOOR - DAY
text: Edgar leads Clyde and a team of Agents into an apartment
text: building. He hands a Thompson machine gun to Clyde.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Blow it down.
text: Clyde hesitates, then pulls the trigger turning the door into
text: swiss cheese. Bullets start flying back at them from behind
text: the door. Edgar and the Agents duck for cover. Edgar’s Agents
text: tear gas into the room.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING / JANITOR’S CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Someone is firing from inside a closet. Agents stand on
text: either side waiting for it to subside. When it does, they rip
text: the door open revealing HARRY BURNETTE. He fires once more,
text: but he’s out of bullets. Edgar steps into frame.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Mr. Burnette, you are under arrest.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER'S OUTER OFFICE -— DAY
text: Edgar with a gaggle of reporters. They’re eating it up:
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Karpis said he’d never be taken
dialog: alive, but we took him without
text: firing a shot. He shook all over --
text: his voice, his hands and his knees.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: And you arrested Harry Campbell in
dialog: Toledo and Burnett in Manhattan as
dialog: well, Mr. Hoover?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (false modesty)
dialog: And William Mahan in California,
dialog: but it was a WE job, not an I job.
dialog: 71.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE - DAY
text: Clyde walks in holding a cereal box. Edgar takes it and digs
text: through it like a kid looking for the toy -- but without any
text: of the joy. Edgar pulls out a toy badge. It says “PURVIS.”
text: REVEAL: the front of the box has an image of Agent Melvin
text: Purvis with: “THE FBI AGENT WHO CAUGHT DILINGER!”
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Write the cereal maker. Let them
dialog: know they must print any further
scene_heading: boxes to read: “FORMER-AGENT” of

dialog: (with a grin)
dialog: sit. I have something to show you.
text: He pulls a letter from his desk, stifles a giggle, and reads:
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: “Only eight more days, funny how
dialog: even the dearest face will fade
dialog: away in time. Most clearly I
dialog: remember your eyes with a kind of
text: teasing smile in them, and the
dialog: feeling of that soft spot just
dialog: north-east of the corner of your
dialog: mouth against my lips.”
text: Edgar almost collapses with laughter.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: It’s from Lorena Hickock, the White
dialog: House reporter with the bad
dialog: breath... to Mrs. Roosevelt!
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: What are you going to do with it?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Nothing. I accused her of having an
dialog: affair with a man, but Old Horse
text: Face is having an affair with Bat
dialog: Breath! A woman! I was wrong!
text: Helen Gandy sticks her head in. Edgar clears the tears from
text: his eyes. He can’t stop laughing.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: Mr. Hoover, they’d like to see you
dialog: in the labratory.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I’1ll be right there, Miss Gandy.
dialog: (she goes)
text: Clyde, the races begin in Del Mar
dialog: next week. I was thinking of taking
dialog: a quick vacation. I thought perhaps
dialog: you’d like to join me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: (smiles, considers)
dialog: I’ve never been to a horse race.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: It’s wonderful. And between you and
dialog: me, when I lose my bets, the track
dialog: covers the losses.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: And when you win?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: They pay!
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: So where’s the thrill?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
text: In the sun that comes down in the
text: stands. The hotel rooms. The
text: service. The dinners. The company.
dialog: Come with me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: I would love to.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I’ll have Miss Gandy make all the
dialog: arrangements. It will be perfect!
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Edgar... I’m afraid I can’t now.
dialog: But perhaps in a few months... if I
dialog: start saving.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
text: No. It’s covered. Completely.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: I really couldn’t do that.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: You’ve done so much for me. For the
dialog: Bureau. Consider it a thank you.
dialog: (Clyde isn’t convinced)
dialog: I’1l get a suite with adjoining
text: rooms instead of separate rooms.
dialog: That will be savings enough.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: It’s a deal.
dialog: (smiles warmly)
dialog: You should go. They’re waiting for
dialog: you in the crime lab... Mr. Hoover.
scene_heading: INT. THE NEW FBI CRIME LABRATORY - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: Clearly Edgar got what he wanted: The basement of the FBI has
text: been turned into a massive new crime lab. Rows and rows of
text: files hold FINGER PRINTS. Rows and rows of SCIENTIFIC
text: INSTRUMENTS and LAB TECHNICIANS fill the halls.
text: Edgar walks the long hall, finally arriving at an EXAMINATION
text: TABLE. Wood specialist, Koehler (earlier), has disassembled
text: the Lindbergh ladder, each rail and rung numbered. As he
text: explains his findings, we see Edgar’s LIGHT STRINGS
text: connecting the evidence. These two are peas in a pod.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR KOEHLER
dialog: There are several kinds of wood
dialog: here. Pine. Birch. Fir. And if you
dialog: look closely, you will see that
dialog: each has its own internal markings,
text: rings and knots, and its own
dialog: external markings, as in here, from
dialog: the machinery that milled the raw
dialog: timber. And these, that mark the
text: tools used to build the ladder.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (re: a long piece of wood)
dialog: This one is very different.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR KOEHLER
dialog: Yes. Number 16. It was a rail. And
dialog: look at these four nail holes. They
dialog: were NOT used in the construction
dialog: of the ladder.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: It was used for something else
dialog: before the ladder was built.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR KOEHLER
dialog: Yes. And it’s low grade sapwood
dialog: with NO signs of weathering, so it
text: was inside, not out. And the pine
text: shows no signs of previous use.
dialog: That tells us this ladder was built
dialog: for THIS job. Nothing else.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: How does this help us identify the
dialog: kidnapper?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR KOEHLER
dialog: I need more money, sir.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: For?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR KOEHLER
dialog: Postage. I need to write to every
dialog: mill on the East coast to see if
text: their blades match these marks.
text: Edgar considers. Is this guy for real, or really nuts? He
text: looks at the wood again, and ALL THE CONNECTIONS LIGHT UP.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I want a report on each mill. And a
dialog: map to track all leads. By the time
dialog: I'm in New York, I want something
dialog: to report, Mr. Koehler.
scene_heading: INT. “G-MEN” MOVIE PREMIERE - NIGHT
text: Up on the screen is the movie “G-Men.” Lighting quick James
text: “Brick” Davis (JAMES CAGNEY) jumps through a window.
speaker_heading: JAMES CAGNEY (IN THE FILM)
dialog: Hold your fire!
text: The machine guns go silent. He grabs the gun from the
text: suspect’s hand and hip tosses him over a table to the floor.
text: Cagney now plays the “G-MAN” as the hero instead of “PUBLIC
text: ENEMY NUMBER ONE.” The G-man has officially replaced the
text: criminal as protagonist. The audience eats it up. REVEAL:
text: Edgar next to Clyde watching with pride.
scene_heading: EXT. “G-MEN” THEATER / RED CARPET - NIGHT
text: On the RED CARPET afterward with Clyde and his mom, Edgar is
text: THE STAR. The press goes mad when A LITTLE GIRL WITH CURLS
text: Marches up and Edgar bends down to her.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY TEMPLE
dialog: Mr. Hoover. I was wondering if you
dialog: would join MY police force.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Why yes. If you agree to be an
dialog: honorary G-woman, Miss Temple...
dialog: and give me one little kiss.
speaker_heading: SHIRLEY TEMPLE
dialog: I don’t know if your wife would
dialog: approve, Mr. Hoover.
text: The press laughs. So does Edgar. He shoots back:
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: But Miss Temple, you see, I still
dialog: live with my mother.
dialog: The press eats it up. It’s everything Edgar ever dreamed of
dialog: for himself and his Bureau.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Edgar gets in back with Clyde. His mother gets in the front.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Are we going to the club?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (a finger to his lips)
dialog: After we drop mother at the hotel.
text: Clyde smiles. As the car pulls away, Edgar moves his hand on
dialog: top of Clyde’s like it’s the most natural thing in the world.
scene_heading: INT. THE STORK CLUB / NYC - NIGHT
text: Edgar and Clyde are escorted in by the CLUB OWNER.
speaker_heading: STORK CLUB OWNER
dialog: I have you at a table with Anita
dialog: Colby. Lela Rogers and her
dialog: daughter, Ginger, have asked if
dialog: they can join.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
text: As long as it’s near the front.
text: And he leads them through the oogling crowd in this, the most
text: exclusive night club in the city. It’s immaculate. The live
text: music and decor make the Great Depression feel like fiction.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: INT. THE STORK CLUB / EDGAR’S TABLE UP FRONT - LATER
text: Edgar holds court with a handful of actresses and singers,
text: amongst them: Lela Rogers and her daughter. He goes on at a
text: mile a minute, the women reacting with giggles and awe.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
text: The bullet entered the back of his
text: head and exited through the front
dialog: near his cheek. The thing people
dialog: don’t realize is that there is very
dialog: little blood. The heat of the
text: bullet seals the wound as it
text: enters. So the scene is far more
dialog: peaceful than you depict in your
text: moving pictures.
text: REVEAL: Clyde is at a remove, literally pushed away by the
text: women to listen from afar and deal with the WAITERS.
speaker_heading: LELA ROGERS
dialog: And little Lindy? Did you see the
dialog: child with your own eyes?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Those aren’t details I can share
dialog: with a group of refined women. I
dialog: couldn’t stand to make a single one
dialog: of you shed a tear. But I assure
dialog: you, we're on the case.
scene_heading: MODEL -- ANITA COLBY
dialog: I saw the Lindberghs in Paris. I
dialog: hardly recognized them.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Only justice can bring reason back
dialog: to their lives... but I might share
dialog: one confidential clue with you. If
dialog: you will swear secrecy.
text: He holds out his pinky. They giggle, hold out theirs and make
text: a four way pinky pact. More laughter. Lela doesn’t let go of
text: his pinky. She’s falling for him. He gets quiet:
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: The first gold notes from the
dialog: ransom money have surfaced. And can
dialog: you guess where?
scene_heading: MODEL -- ANITA COLBY
dialog: Tell us... Please, Mr. Hoover.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: In the Bronx. On three occasions.
dialog: And each of the shop owners who
dialog: turned them in claim they received
text: them from a man with a pointed
text: chin... and a German accent.
text: Anita gasps and cozies up to Edgar. Lela clocks it. She wants
text: him to herself. Clyde watches it all play out from afar.
speaker_heading: ANITA COLBY
dialog: (flirting)
dialog: Take my word for it, Mr. Hoover,
dialog: all the admiration in the world
dialog: can’t fill the spot where love
dialog: goes... or keep your bed warm.
text: Clyde tunes in. Edgar tries not to notice.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I serve my country, Miss Colby. A
dialog: nation’s admiration is more than
dialog: enough for me.
speaker_heading: ANITA COLBY
text: But it likely makes for a cold bed.
text: The band strikes up “RED SAILS IN THE SUNSET.” Lela sees it
text: as an opportunity to pull “her Edgar” away.
speaker_heading: LELA ROGERS
dialog: Mr. Hoover. Would it be out of the
dialog: question to bother you for a dance?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (suddenly panicked)
dialog: How do you mean?
speaker_heading: LELA ROGERS
dialog: Well... simply a dance. You do
dialog: dance, don’t you?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (turning red)
dialog: It's a skill I haven’t mastered,
text: and the night is getting long.
speaker_heading: LELA ROGERS
dialog: Then no time like the present. This
dialog: is my favorite song.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (turning purple)
dialog: Mr. Toulson, I think it’s t-t-time
dialog: for us to go. We have a good deal
dialog: of work t-t-tomorrow. I’m afraid I
dialog: just don’t have t--t--time to
dialog: dance. My sincere apology. N-- Now
dialog: Mr. Toulson. This minute.
text: And Edgar finally wiggles his way out of the table, clearly
text: running away from the women. Clyde follows.
text: Lela and Ginger can’t contain their laughter. Edgar catches a
text: glimpse of it on his way out. He’s humiliated.
scene_heading: INT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL / MOTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: On his mother’s bed is a now giant album of Edgar’s press
text: clippings with a new shot of Edgar from the premiere’s press
text: book. Edgar is crying and stuttering at her beside.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I--I--I d--d--d-don’t like to d-d--
dialog: d--d-dance, a-a--
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: Edgar, go look in the mirror and
dialog: talk the way the doctor taught you
dialog: to. Be my little Speedie.
text: He stands up, looks in the mirror, straightens his posture,
text: and starts talking in his fast, “speedie” way, the way the
dialog: world knows him -- it’s his stutter cure.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes, mother, I can spit my words
text: out with precision, diction and
dialog: clarity. I don’t like to dance. I
dialog: don’t like to dance with anyone,
dialog: but mostly I don’t like to dance
dialog: with women, mother. It’s about time
dialog: you knew. I find it humiliating and
dialog: I refuse to be publicly humiliated.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: Edgar. Stop.
dialog: (he does)
dialog: Do you remember Barton Pincus?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (speedy in the mirror)
dialog: His father was the watchmaker. He
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: was 10 years younger than me, and
dialog: you called him “Birdie” or “Daffy.”
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: Do you remember what happened to
text: “Daffy” after the school custodian
text: discovered him in the hoop skirt
dialog: and the flower bonnet?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: He was made to stand outside our
text: school wearing the skirt and bonnet
dialog: as punishment.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: And did you ever wonder why we
dialog: called him Daffy?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: For his odd behavior.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: It was short for daffodil, Edgar.
dialog: And do you remember what happened
dialog: to little Daffodile Pincus?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes... He shot himself six weeks
dialog: after he stood outside school in
dialog: that skirt.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER
dialog: That’s right. And I thank God every
dialog: day that my own sons don’t suffer
dialog: from his condition. Edgar. I'd
dialog: rather have a dead son than a
dialog: daffodil for a son.
text: She closes Edgar’s album and wills herself out of bed.
speaker_heading: EDGAR’S MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Now I’1l to teach you how to dance.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes mother.
text: Edgar cannot even face her. He can only look at her through
text: the mirror. It’s a heartbreaking moment.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
text: Lights, cameras, Edgar is filming a new televised speech.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: It is imperative that we preserve
dialog: and protect the morals of the
dialog: American family. If the home is
dialog: imperiled, if the home is

text: civilization crashes to its doom.
text: Clyde watches from afar, surprised / concerned by Edgar's

speaker_heading: AGENT TWO
text: 456 west 3rd.

speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: We knew who we were looking for.

dialog: 82.
scene_heading: EXT. A BRONX NEWPAPER STAND - DAY
speaker_heading: NEWSPAPER BOY
text: Like a German accent maybe.
scene_heading: EXT. A BRONX BAKERY - DAY
speaker_heading: THE BAKER
text: A German. With big cheek bones.
scene_heading: INT. CORN EXCHANGE BANK / THE BRONX - SEPT 18, 1934 - DAY
dialog: A TELLER holds a $10 gold certificate:
speaker_heading: SCARED TELLER
dialog: Am I going to get him in some kind
dialog: of trouble?
speaker_heading: AGENT SISK
dialog: Not if he didn’t do anything wrong.
dialog: We’re the FBI, son. The good guys.
speaker_heading: SCARED TELLER
dialog: (considers, then)
dialog: It was deposited by Walter Lyle. He
text: manages the gas station. Up on
dialog: Lexington and 127th.
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION / LEXINGTON AND 127TH / THE BRONX - DAY
text: Agent Sisk is with WALTER LYLE, he’s nervous, sweating as he
text: handles the gold note from the bank.
speaker_heading: WALTER LYLE
dialog: Yes. I remember him. He bought 89
dialog: cents worth of gas.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
dialog: And paid with this bill?
speaker_heading: WALTER LYLE
dialog: Yes, sir. But I don’t know him.
dialog: I’ve never seen him since.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
dialog: He was memorable enough that you’d
dialog: remember it if he came in again?
speaker_heading: WALTER LYLE
dialog: Yes. He was German, I think. I
text: mean, with an accent. Pointed chin--
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
dialog: (withering; same old story)
dialog: --and high cheek bones, right?
speaker_heading: WALTER LYLE
dialog: Yes. And I guess I looked at the
dialog: bill funny because he assured me he
dialog: had 100 more just like it. At home.
speaker_heading: AGENT SISK
dialog: (perks up)
dialog: You had a conversation with him?
speaker_heading: WALTER LYLE
dialog: No. That was it.
dialog: (Sisk withers again)
dialog: But I wrote down his license plate
dialog: number. That’s the writing right
text: here along the edge of the bill.
text: And he holds up the bill to show Agent Sisk -- BINGO!
scene_heading: INT. THE FBI HALLWAY - DAY
text: Edgar walks the halls with purpose. Energized.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Miss Gandy, get Mr. Toulson.
text: Helen emerges from her office and follows. Toulson does the
text: same. They’re a trio by the time they burst through--
scene_heading: INT. FBI OFFICES - CONTINUOUS
text: --the investigating office doors. Agent Sisk is there,
text: waiting at the pin covered map. He needs no prompting.
speaker_heading: AGENT SISK
dialog: The New York Motor Vehicles
dialog: Bureau’s describes it as a dark
text: blue 1930 Dodge sedan. The owner is
dialog: a carpenter who was born in
dialog: Germany, and lives at 1279 East
dialog: 222nd Street... in the Bronx.
text: Sisk pushes a pin into the address. The map lights up in
text: Edgar’s head. It all fits. The lumber yard, the cemetary, and
dialog: the spots the bills were spent.
speaker_heading: AGENT SISK (CONT’D)
dialog: His name is Richard Bruno
dialog: Hauptmann.
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE - SEPTEMBER 19TH 1934 — DAY
text: A black sedan carrying EDGAR and TWO OFFICERS is parked. They
text: watch through binoculars as -- A man leaves his house, walks
text: around to his locked garage and disappears.
text: The man re-emerges in his car -- a 1930 BLUE DODGE SEDAN.
text: They tail him as he drives up Tremont Avenue. Traffic picks
text: up. THEY LOSE SIGHT OF HIM FOR A MOMENT. When he comes back
text: into view, they see ANOTHER POLICEMAN HAS PULLED HIM OVER.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Pull over!
text: The driver does. Edgar leaps out, runs to the car, and pushes
text: the other officer out of the way.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: FBI. Put your hands up.
text: Edgar jams his gun in the car. The man inside puts his hands
text: up, and in a truly innocent way, with a German accent asks:
speaker_heading: MAN IN CAR
dialog: Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
text: Get out of the car.
text: He does. The officers put him face first against the car.
text: Edgar pulls the man’s ID and a $20 bill out of his wallet.
text: The bill has a gold marker on it. Edgar quickly checks its
text: serial number using his MASTER LIST. It’s a match.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Bruno Hauptmann, you are under
dialog: arrest for the kidnapping and
dialog: murder of Charles Lindbergh Junior.
text: And he’s cuffed.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW JERSEY JAIL —- DAY
text: FLASH! FLASH! The Press snaps photos of Hauptmann being
text: escorted in. Edgar is front and center. Colonel Schwartzkopf
text: (Lindbergh’s home earlier) is pushed off to the side. The
text: FREEZE FRAME of this still crosses the cut to:
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY - 1964
text: Old Hoover is examining the same still as Agent Garrison's
text: keys strike the paper, the pages are stacking up. A new cover
text: page reads, “UNTITLED FBI STORY.”
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: We need a title, Agent Garrison.
text: Garrison just keeps typing. The phone rings. Hoover picks up.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: We're working, Miss Gandy.
speaker_heading: OLD HELEN GANDY (V.O.)
text: The tape came in.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: (perks up)
dialog: Put it in my private office.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE - DAY
text: Hoover loops up a reel to reel audio tape. He treats it like
text: a blown egg. Precious, fragile.
text: He hits PLAY. At first the sounds are hard to make out. A
scene_heading: DOOR CLOSING, FABRIC MOVING, CHIT CHAT, DRINKING. The words
text: are hard to distinguish, but it sounds like A FEW BLACK MEN
text: AND TWO BLACK WOMAN. Hoover leans in, titillated.
scene_heading: INT. WILLARD HOTEL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
text: WE FOCUS ON: the microphone under the bed. We see feet and
text: shadows, but mostly it’s just sounds.
text: (As Hoover hits fast forward, the film zooms forward and the
text: shadows move faster, returning to normal when he hits play)
text: FAST FORWARD: talking. FAST FORWARD: Kissing. FAST FORWARD /
text: STOP / PLAY: It’s audio roulette. He hits the jackpot: the
text: sound of THE BLACK MEN HAVING SEX WITH THE TWO BLACK WOMEN.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER'S INNER OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hoover is listening, his forehead is misty, he may even be
text: Masturbating, it’s tough to tell. The phone rings. He ignores
text: it. It rings again. He ignores it, trying to keep his focus.
text: It won’t stop ringing. He flies into a rage, and picks up the
text: phone -- without hitting stop on the tape player.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: I told you I’m not to be disturbed.
scene_heading: INT. HELEN GANDY’S OFFICE - SAME TIME
text: Old Helen can hear the sex recording through the phone.
speaker_heading: HELEN GANDY
dialog: Mr. Hoover. It’s urgent. I have
dialog: Agent Shakin on from Dallas.--
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
speaker_heading: GORDON SHANKLIN (V.O.)
dialog: My apologies Mr. Hoover, I told
dialog: Miss Gandy to put me right through.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: What is it, Agent, Shankin?
speaker_heading: GORDON SHANKLIN (V.O.)
text: Sir, the President has been shot.
dialog: (Edgar is stunned)
dialog: He was just declared dead, sir.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Who knows about this?
speaker_heading: GORDON SHANKLIN (V.O.)
dialog: No one, sir. I thought you should
dialog: know before the press reports it.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Thank you, Agent Shankin.
text: He hangs up. Even steely Hoover has to process the magnitude
text: of this moment. He walks into his outer office, considering
text: his next move. He focuses in on his NOW COMPLETED REPLICA OF
text: ROBERT KENNEDY'S FIREPLACE. He picks up his phone and dials.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (CONT ’D)
dialog: Get me Robert Kennedy... I don’t
dialog: care where in McLean he is. Put me
dialog: through immediately.
scene_heading: INT. HOME IN MCLEAN, VIRGINIA - MOMENTS LATER / INTERCUT
text: Robert Kennedy walks up to his phone, relaxed, unaware.
scene_heading: ROBERT F. KENNEDY
dialog: Mr. Hoover?
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Mr. Kennedy, The President has been
dialog: shot.
text: Hoover hangs up. He eyes the red buzzer on his desk. He
text: unscrews the bulb and the light goes out.
scene_heading: EXT. PIMLICO RACETRACK / BALTIMORE - DAY
text: The flags are all at half staff for Kennedy. Hoover doesn’t
text: seem to notice. He’s got his eye on the 6th race of the day.
text: Toulson is by his side. Both are using binoculars, both stand
text: as the horses round the end headed toward the home stretch--
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DEL MAR RACETRACK / CALIFORNIA - DAY - 1935
text: The horses round the corner 30 years earlier in Del Mar.
text: REVEAL: Edgar and Clyde, dressed to the nines, watching a
text: similar race. They’ve clearly made it to their vacation.
dialog: Their horse wins! It’s pure joy. These two are being treated
text: like royalty, surrounded by DESI ARNAZ, BING CROSBY, JIMMY
scene_heading: DURANTE, LUCILLE BALL, and A FEW MOBSTER TYPES.
scene_heading: INT. UPSCALE HOTEL SUITE / BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Clyde changes into a robe and checks his hair. It takes very
text: little for him to be handsome. He’s far more interested in
text: his race stubs, his treasures. He places them carefully ina
text: zippered pouch of his dop kit.
scene_heading: INT. UPSCALE HOTEL SUITE / BATHROOM - SAME TIME
text: Edgar is in his own bathroom changing into a silk robe. He
text: checks his hair, finds a grey and plucks it out. He slicks
text: the rest back. He brushes his teeth with precision and spits.
text: He walks out of his bathroom, through his bedroom, and into
dialog: the central living room just as--
scene_heading: INT. UPSCALE HOTEL SUITE / LIVINGROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: --Clyde enters from his own suite. Without words, Clyde pours
text: two cocktails. Edgar finds a radio station.
text: Edgar turns and watches Clyde from behind, finishing their
text: drinks. It all feels very romantic.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Did you see his shoes?
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Desi Arnaz? The leather ones with
text: the horrible buckles across the
dialog: top? No didn’t notice them one bit.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: You’d think with all of their money
dialog: they’d have better fashion sense,
dialog: or pay someone to have it for them.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: And his fau-ginger wife, when she
dialog: walked in, I was afraid a hunter
dialog: might pull a rifle on that hat.
text: Edgar imitates how it must have bounced each time she took a
text: step. Clyde is charmed. He sits. Edgar does the same. Clyde
text: puts his hand on Edgar’s. Edgar continues laughing for a bit -
text: - without taking his hand away.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: I care so very much for you, Clyde.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: (gets up the nerve, then)
dialog: I love you, Edgar.
text: Edgar won’t look at Clyde -- who is looking right at him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes.
text: Out of nerves or preparation, in the slightest of gestures,
text: Clyde wets his lip.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT'D)
dialog: c-Can I ask you s-something?
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Anything.
text: Edgar removes his hand to reach for a drink he doesn’t need.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: What do you think of Dorothy
dialog: Lamour? The actress.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: With Rudy Vallee at the Stork Club?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: That’s the one.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: She’s a bit too camp for me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Well, I’m thinking... of t-t-taking
text: her up on a proposal.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: For dinner?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: No. We’ve already had dinners.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: On the weekends. When I’ve gone up
dialog: to New York.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: (that feels like cheating)
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: What I’m asking is... I think it
dialog: may be time for a Mrs. Hoover.
dialog: (Clyde can’t even speak)
dialog: You don’t like her?
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Don’t make a fool of me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: I’m not.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: (the big, scary question)
dialog: Have you become... physical?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Yes. We have.
dialog: (Toulson quietly fumes)
dialog: You’d rather me be half a person,
dialog: Clyde? Remain incomplete?
text: Toulson throws his drink against a wall. Edgar shrieks.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: Am I an incompletion?
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Pick that glass up.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: No. I won’t. I have no reason to.
dialog: Fire me. Now. Go on.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: You are making a fool of yourself.
text: And Clyde clears two more glasses on the bar onto the floor.
text: There is glass everywhere. Edgar is speechless.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: Clyde, and you have no shoes on.
dialog: Stop this!
text: Clyde gets up in Edgar’s face. It looks like he might fight
dialog: him physically.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: You will never tell me what to do
dialog: again. You just lost that right. I
dialog: see through you. You’re a scared,
text: heartless, horrible, little man.
text: Edgar throws a punch. It lands. Toulson throws one of his
text: own. It’s a brutal fight. Years of pent up attraction.
text: They crash to the floor. Clyde pins Edgar. He considers
text: pounding his face in. Instead, he kisses Edgar full on the
text: lips. They hold for a moment. Edgar hardly resists. Finally,
text: Clyde pulls away.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: (not meaning it)
dialog: Don’t ever do that again.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: I won't.
text: Clyde checks himself for cuts and starts out of the room.
text: He’s almost to his bedroom when Edgar stops him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Don’t leave me, Clyde... Please. We
dialog: have a second day of races.
dialog: (hard words to form)
dialog: I’m begging you.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON
dialog: (a long beat, then)
dialog: If you ever mention a lady friend
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOULSON (CONT'D)
dialog: again, that will be the last day
dialog: you share my company.
text: Clyde goes. Edgar touches his lips, recalling Clyde’s against
text: his. A sensation he may never feel again. He calms his
text: shaking, gets up, and starts collecting glass off the floor.
text: The sound of a GUNSHOT -- crosses the cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. PIMLICO RACETRACK / BALTIMORE - DAY - 1964
text: Picking up where the race left off before the flashback -
dialog: flags still at half staff:
text: --as the horses round the corner to the finish, Old Toulson
text: feels a numbness in his right shoulder. He blinks his eyes,
text: he’s seeing flashes. He shifts as if tripping, as if the
text: ground just moved, and he sits. Hoover rushes to his side. So
dialog: do others around them.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: What is it, Clyde?
dialog: (Clyde can’t answer)
dialog: Get a doctor!
scene_heading: INT. DC HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM - DAY
text: Flanked by TWO AGENTS and Miss Gandy, Hoover looks quite ill.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: He should be able to recover most
dialog: of his function, but a stroke like
dialog: this will limit the hours he can
dialog: work. The information he can
dialog: process. For a while at least...
dialog: Are you okay, Mr. Hoover?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: I played in the yard with my dog on
text: Saturday. Perhaps it’s dehydration.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: That could do it. But it may be
dialog: wise to reduce your work hours as
dialog: well. At your age it’s important to
dialog: take leave.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Can I have some privacy please?
text: The other Agents go. Hoover steams.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: If you ever denigrate me in front
dialog: of my staff again, I will have you
dialog: railroaded out of your profession.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (truly afraid)
dialog: I apologize, sir.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: What do you have for energy?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: We have diet medications that tend
dialog: to give a boost.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: So I could lose a few pounds and
dialog: have more energy?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You don’t need to worry about your
dialog: weight sir, it’s solid weight.
text: It’s ass kissing, but Hoover appreciates it.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: We’ll schedule a daily visit.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S ADULTHOOD HOME / BREAKFAST TABLE - DAY
text: Hoover and Toulson sit across from each other. Hoover taps a
text: hard boiled egg with a spoon and expertly peels it.
text: Toulson struggles to grip his spoon. His entire right side is
text: immobilized. His face droops. Hoover lets him struggle.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: They’re giving him the Nobel Prize.
dialog: (Toulson nods.)
dialog: The degenerates and radicals are
text: being lifted up internationally.
dialog: It’s like 1920 all over again.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: Don't...
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: When he finds out we have this
dialog: tape, that we know the truth about
dialog: his character, he will decline the
dialog: award.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: Johnson... Wait.
text: He ignores Toulson’s plea, focusing instead on Toulson’s egg
text: struggle. He gets up, leans in close and peels it for him.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: I can’t understand you, Clyde. You
dialog: have to work harder to enunciate.
dialog: (Toulson looks concerned)
dialog: We have no legal recourse. Law
dialog: enforcement hasn’t kept pace with
dialog: the improved tactics of today’s
dialog: criminals.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: What’s the... idea.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: We have friends in the press. We
dialog: plant stories with them to insure
dialog: the activities of suspected radical
text: leaders see the light of day.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: They’1l trace it.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Only if they’re true. It’s Counter
dialog: intelligence, Clyde. The more
dialog: untrue the story, the more dramatic
dialog: the impact. I’m going to deliver
dialog: the hotel recording the day before
dialog: the Nobel Prize with a personal
dialog: letter. If he still accepts it.
dialog: I’ll deliver the tape to the press.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: The tape may... not be legal.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: That’s why the letter won’t be from
dialog: me. It will be a fictitious letter
dialog: from one of his own.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: There would be... no room for
dialog: error. I’m not certain we could...
dialog: insure that.
dialog: Hoover doesn’t like the prudent advice or his “special
text: friend’s” flagrant display of mortality.
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: I can’t understand you, Clyde.
text: Hoover hits his own yolk. It’s hard. He tosses it down to his
text: dog who’s been waiting expectantly.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: I need you back at the office
text: tomorrow. It’s no time to relent.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: I can’t.
dialog: It’s not the answer Hoover wanted.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE - DAY
text: The doctor fills a syringe with amphetamines, leans in to
text: Hoover’s arm, and slides the needle gently in.
text: CLOSE ON: Old Hoover’s eyes dilate. He’s juiced.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
text: Edgar is sitting at the typewriter himself now. Writing. We
text: hear the words. It’s manic, emotional, a drug induced tirade.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: Look into your heart. You know you
dialog: are a complete fraud and a great
dialog: liability to all of us Negroes.
dialog: (This is a fraudulent letter)
dialog: White people in this country have
dialog: enough frauds of their own but I am
dialog: sure they don’t have one at this
dialog: time that is anywhere near your
dialog: equal. I repeat...
dialog: (return key, return key)
dialog: I repeat... you are a colossal
text: fraud and an evil, vicious one at
dialog: that. You could not believe in
dialog: God... Clearly you don’t believe in
dialog: any personal moral principles.
dialog: (is this all self-reflection?)
dialog: You have turned out to be not a
dialog: leader, but a dissolute, abnormal
dialog: moral imbecile.
dialog: (he reflects, then)
dialog: There is only one thing left for
dialog: you to do. You know what it is...
dialog: There is but one way out for you.
dialog: You better take it before your
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is
dialog: bared to the nation.
text: The letter is a bloody, inky tirade. He seals it in an
text: envelope. It says as much about Hoover’s own state as it does
dialog: about the mysterious recipient.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
text: Hoover is with a new writer, AGENT JONES. He almost looks
text: black -- mixed race perhaps. Hoover is trying to process it.
speaker_heading: AGENT JONES
dialog: Miss Gandy told me you stopped with
dialog: Bruno Hauptman’s arrest. Should we
dialog: start there?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Yes... Check for his address in
dialog: earlier drafts...
scene_heading: INT. BRUNO HAUPTMANS HOME - DAY - 1934
text: Hauptmann is handcuffed, standing in the middle of the room.
text: His wife walks in. Edgar’s focus shifts from a pricey
text: STROMBERG-CARLSON RADIO to her expensive shoes. Officers keep
text: her from embracing her husband. She starts to cry. Hauptmann
text: tries to comfort her -- in German:
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: Es ist nichts. Es ist Uber meine
dialog: Gliicksspiel.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: OFFICER ONE
dialog: That this is about his gambling.
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: May I sit?
text: He knows he’s been caught in a lie. He sits by the window.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Where’s the rest of his money?
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: I don’t know what you mean. Or who
dialog: HE is.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: You don’t know who Charles
dialog: Lindbergh is?
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: Except maybe from the papers, no.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: This isn’t the kind of money a
dialog: carpenter makes, Mr. Hauptmann.
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: I made Wall Street investments.
text: Agents in the adjoining room start ripping open Hauptman’s
text: Mattress, but Hauptmann pays it no attention. He simply gazes
text: out the window. Edgar takes note. He walks to the window,
text: peers out, and sees the small, crude, garage fifty feet away.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNO HAUPTMAN’S GARAGE - LATER
text: Agents tear up the floorboards in the garage. They find fresh
text: dirt, grab a shovel, and dig into it and quickly find a jar
text: buried in a hole, but it is only filled with water.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNO HAUPTMANS HOME - MOMENTS LATER
text: Edgar stands in front of Hauptmann holding the empty jar.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: Where is the ransom money, Bruno?
dialog: Did you spend it all on your old
dialog: lady’s shoe collection?
text: His wife Anna’s shoes are in a pile in the middle of the
text: floor. She’s having a nervous breakdown.
text: Agents start carting out stacks of Hauptman’s papers, filled
text: with his handwriting.
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: Where are you taking my things?
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: To the FBI, Mr. Hauptmann. Does
dialog: that worry you?
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: You hunt the wrong man because I
dialog: have accent, because you don’t
dialog: trust immigrant. You are a bigot.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNO HAUPTMANS HOME - NIGHT - 1935
text: AGENTS cuff Hauptman to a chair. A NYPD OFFICER has a hammer.
text: The lights go out. We hear punches, blows and screams.
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: INT. FBI LABRATORY - DAY
text: The mass of Hauptman’s papers and journals have arrived.
dialog: Albert Osborne (the handwriting expert from earlier) is there
dialog: to receive them.
scene_heading: INT. A NEO-COLONIAL BUILDING / LIMBO - DAY
text: Albert Osborne is isolated on a riser with 11x14 photostat
text: blow ups of letters and words from Hauptman’s writings.
speaker_heading: ALBERT S. OSBORNE
text: In both the ransom note and Mr.
dialog: Hauptmann’s personal writings, he
dialog: wrote, “haus” for house, “anyding”
dialog: for anything,”gut” for good,” and
dialog: “boad” for boat, And notice the
dialog: inverted capital “N”s and “y”s that
dialog: look like “j"s
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY - 1964
dialog: With the mixed race agent.
speaker_heading: AGENT JONES
dialog: But couldn’t those sorts of
dialog: Germanic formations come from any
dialog: number of immigrants? Aren’t those
dialog: common translation mistakes?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: You're right, Agent Jones. Alone it
dialog: wouldn’t have been enough. So when
dialog: my agents arrived to replace the
dialog: local police, we searched again.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNO HAUPTMAN’S GARAGE - DAY - 1934
text: FBI AGENTS are literally dismantling the garage. EDGAR IS
text: STANDING WATCH. The NYC Police simply observe. Edgar is
text: focused on a piece of wood he finds odd. It’s above the work-
text: bench -- a board nailed across two joists.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER
dialog: What purpose would a piece of wood
dialog: like this serve?
text: REVEAL: wood expert Koehler is now there too.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR KOEHLER
text: It doesn’t appear structural.
dialog: 98.
text: JUMP TO: AGENTS carefully pull the board off the joists,
text: waiting to see if anything gives structurally. It doesn’t.
text: Behind it they finds TWO NEWSPAPER PACKETS. Edgar opens one
text: carefully. Inside are ONE HUNDRED TEN-DOLLAR GOLD NOTES.

text: AT THE SAME TIME: Arthur Koehler finds Hauptman’s tool chest.
text: He opens it. It’s neat and organized. All of the tools are in

dialog: The same space the handwriting expert appeared in earlier --
text: now Arthur Koehler is explaining his own findings.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR KOEHLER
dialog: You see, no two saws make the same
dialog: markings. This saw from Bruno
text: Hauptmann’s tool chest makes
dialog: markings identical to those found
dialog: on the ladder used in the crime. I
dialog: searched 1900--
dialog: (holds up a piece of wood)
dialog: --factories across the country to
dialog: see which blade made the other cuts
dialog: on the ladder. I narrowed it down
text: to one. Centralia lumber yard. Four

text: CLOSE ON: Edgar listens from a bench, seemingly alone, giddy
dialog: with this man’s scientific exactitude.
scene_heading: INT. BRUNO HAUPTMAN’S ATTIC - NIGHT
text: Edgar is with Agent Sisk and Arthur Koehler as they approach
text: an attic corner and see -- an eight foot board is missing.
text: Koehler unwraps a long bag labeled -- “Rail 16.” It’s the
dialog: original rail he pointed out to Edgar in the lab so long ago.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR KOEHLER (V.O.)
text: Rail 16. It didn’t match the rest.
dialog: And those extra holes. Why were
dialog: they there?
dialog: 99.
text: He lays the wood next to the empty spot in the floor. It’s a

speaker_heading: AGENT JONES
dialog: But did he do it alone?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: (displeased with the question)
dialog: He never confessed, but what
dialog: sociopath ever does. The evidence
dialog: was clear. He was indicted for
dialog: murder in the first degree while
text: perpetrating a burglary. In New

scene_heading: EXT. COURT HOUSE / COURT AND MAIN STREET / FLEMING, NJ - DAY
text: The two story, neo-colonial building stands strong with four

text: The streets are filled with CARS, REPORTERS, and EAGER
text: CITIZENS. A MAN sells miniature replicas of the kidnapper’s

text: In a makeshift radio studio in the back of a truck, an
dialog: announcer reports:
speaker_heading: RADIO ANNOUNCER
dialog: January 2nd, 1935, a cold winter

dialog: what has now undoubtedly been penned

scene_heading: INT. COURT ROOM - DAY
dialog: REVEAL: this is the space the EXPERT AGENTS have been

text: NOW WE REVEAL: he’s not alone. The courtroom is packed with
text: REPORTERS and ONLOOKERS. From their dress and entourage, it’s
dialog: clear many are rich and/or famous.
text: The prosecutor, WILENTZ, calls his next witness:
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
dialog: Your honor, I would like to call to
dialog: the stand Mr. Charles Lindbergh.
text: In a gray suit and shirt with a tie, Charles Lindbergh walks
text: slowly and confidently up to the stand and takes the seat
text: next to THE JUDGE. The room is hushed.
text: Lindbergh looks through the crowd, to the defense stand,
text: stopping on Anna Hauptmann. He remains calm, unreadable.
speaker_heading: WILENTZ (CONT’D)
dialog: Picking up where you left off. You
dialog: said you heard a voice, in the
dialog: cemetary that night.
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
text: Yes. Very clearly. A voice coming
dialog: from the cemetary, to the best of
dialog: my belief, calling Dr. Condon. In a
dialog: foreign accent, “Hey, Doctor.”
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
dialog: And since that time, have you heard
dialog: the same voice?
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
dialog: Yes, I have.
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
dialog: And whose voice was it, Colonel,
dialog: that you heard in the vicinity of
dialog: St. Raymond’s Cemetery that night,
dialog: saying, “Hey Doctor?”
text: And for the first time, Lindbergh turns his gaze from Wilentz-
dialog: -- to Bruno Hauptmann. Emotionless, Strong:
scene_heading: CHARLES LINDBERGH
text: That was Hauptman’s voice.
dialog: 101.
text: Hauptmann locks eyes with Lindbergh. They hold their gazes
text: for a moment. The air goes out of the room. Lindbergh looks
text: back to Wilentz and A GASP RUNS THROUGH THE ROOM.
scene_heading: INT. COURT ROOM - LATER
speaker_heading: COURT CLERK

scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY - 1964
text: Agent Jones watches Hoover pulls the shades. The room goes
text: dark. Hoover fires up a film projector... It’s B&W footage of
text: Hauptmann from the trial itself.
text: Hauptmann is on the stand being questioned. He’s combative,
dialog: arrogant, and easily bothered:
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
dialog: You have had an opportunity in this
dialog: court today to tell the whole
dialog: truth. Have you told the truth?
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMANN
dialog: I told the truth already.
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
dialog: And the statements you made to
dialog: District Attorney Foley, did you
dialog: tell him the whole truth?
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMANN
dialog: To a certain extent
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
dialog: And to a certain extent you didn't
dialog: tell him the truth, is that it?
text: Silence from Hauptmann.

text: here. It is a little blurred now,
dialog: isn't it?
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: Looks like it.
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
text: It looks like 2974, and the numbers
dialog: down here, 3-7154, is that right?
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
dialog: And between those numbers are some
text: words, it looks like "Decatur" and
dialog: "Sedgwick", you see that? You know
dialog: what that means don't you, that
dialog: address on there?
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: Not exactly.
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
text: It is Dr. Condon's address and
dialog: telephone number. The man who paid
dialog: the ransom. Written in your writing
dialog: on a board in your closet.
text: A SPLICE IN THE OLD FILM:
speaker_heading: WILENTZ (CONT'D)
dialog: And when you saw this piece of wood
dialog: you said, "That's my lumber." Isn't
dialog: that so - in the Bronx.
speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: I said, "Yes," without thinking.
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
dialog: You don't usually do things without

speaker_heading: BRUNO HAUPTMAN
dialog: I don't think so, not so good.
speaker_heading: WILENTZ
dialog: Oh, you really DO think so, don't

dialog: Say it Clyde.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: It’s so risky. Over a few negative
dialog: news articles, Edgar?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: He’s deliberately allowed himself
text: to be surrounded by Communists.
dialog: With the power he’s gathered he’s
dialog: now the greatest domestic threat--
text: Edgar turns up the volume. He focuses in on: a chiron.
scene_heading: “SWEDEN - NOBEL PEACE PRIZE”
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER (CONT’D)
dialog: He’1l decline the award. He knows
dialog: what we have could ruin him. There
dialog: is no question. He’s done, Clyde.
text: Hoover stops breathing. He can’t hear the reporter. He’s now
text: focused on the grainy B&W image of MARTIN LUTHER KING being
text: handed the Nobel Peace Prize. And then his words:
scene_heading: MARTIN LUTHER KING
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: I accept the Nobel Prize for Peace
dialog: at a moment when 22 million Negroes
dialog: of the United States of America are
text: engaged in a creative battle to end

dialog: (a jump cut)
dialog: --all the people of the world will
dialog: have to discover a way to live
dialog: together in peace... man must evolve
text: a method which rejects revenge,
dialog: aggression and retaliation.
dialog: (a jump cut)
dialog: I believe that unarmed truth and
dialog: unconditional love will have the

dialog: right temporarily defeated is

dialog: believe that what self-centered men
dialog: have torn down, men other-centered
dialog: can build up.
dialog: It’s now clear that the man Hoover’s been after this whole

speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: The mountain of evidence we

speaker_heading: AGENT JONES

speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Of course. That’s what he does.
speaker_heading: AGENT JONES

speaker_heading: BEN BRADLEE

speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: The SCLC has direct ties to

speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: If you’re going to be candid, Ben.
dialog: Be candid.
speaker_heading: BEN BRADLEE
dialog: You know the funny thing about

dialog: sake? If unchecked, it inevitably
dialog: leads to villainy... infamy.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Exactly. And I’ve worked too hard

speaker_heading: BEN BRADLEE
dialog: With all due respect, sir, I

scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S CHILDHOOD HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Edgar is in shock, lost in the only home he’s ever known. He

text: JUMP TO: Edgar slips his mother’s old dress over his head.
text: He’s gained some weight and it almost fits. He pulls on his

text: AN EVEN OLDER HOOVER gets up from his chair. He seems drugged
text: out of his mind. He walks to the window. Outside there is a

dialog: 110.
text: He looks down just in time to see the presidential motorcade.
dialog: It’s the inauguration of Richard Nixon.

text: Hoover sits outside Nixon’s office. IT’S THE EXACT SAME SHOT,

scene_heading: EXT. HOOVER’S INNER OFFICE - DAY
text: Helen walks through the outer office to Hoover's inner office

speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: “What file, sir?” But he knows. He

speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: We can’t do that. Especially now.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: That’s the problem, Clyde. If I

speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: That's illegal.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: He didn’t say it. I could see it in

speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: (the irony hurts)

speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: I was thinking it might be time for

dialog: longer I have.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Shut up, Clyde.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: You built a great thing, Edgar. If you

dialog: what you want, isn’t it? Our country’s
dialog: adoration? There’s a chance you could

speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: And why wouldn’t I have it?! I
dialog: saved this country from Bolshevik

dialog: convicted Bruno Hauptmann, and now
dialog: when I try with my last breath to

dialog: horse in the street, no gun--
dialog: 114.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW ORLEANS STREET - DAY - 1935
text: A REPLAY OF THE EARLIER KARPIS ARREST -- This time Edgar
text: doesn’t lead the charge. Karpis simply walks out of the
text: building, and is surrounded by armed FBI Agents. Only when
text: it’s safe does Edgar emerges from the shadows.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: --in the back seat. And YOU didn’t
dialog: kill Dilinger. Agent Purvis did--
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER OFFICE - 1971
text: CLOSE ON: Dilinger’s death mask, pipe and glasses on display.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON (V.O.)
dialog: --but you kept the glory for
dialog: yourself. And Machine Gun Kelly
dialog: never said, “Don’t Shoot G-men.”
dialog: You made it up for the comics.
scene_heading: INT. TOULSON’S HOUSE - NIGHT -— CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: And when we went to the scene of the
dialog: “greatest crime of the century,” Mr.
dialog: Lindbergh didn’t come out and--
scene_heading: EXT. CHARLES LINDBERGH’S HOME - DAY - 193
text: UNLIKE THE EARLIER VERSION -- Edgar gets in his car, his eye
text: on Lindbergh in his upper window, refusing to even make eye
text: contact with Edgar and Clyde on the driveway below.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON (V.0O.)
dialog: --shake your hand and express his
dialog: faith in the FBI. He called you a
text: “fussy little man” and refused to
dialog: even meet you.
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE - SEPTEMBER 19TH 1934 - DAY
text: A REPLAY OF HAUPTMANN’S ARREST: This time it’s not Edgar
dialog: making the bust, it’s Agent Sisk
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON (V.0.)
dialog: You didn’t arrest Hauptmann. Agent
dialog: Sisk did. You weren’t even at the
text: scene. Just the photo-op.
scene_heading: INT. TOULSON’S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: In atypical fashion, Hoover is silent. He knows it’s true.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: Most of what you wrote was
dialog: exaggeration. The rest lies, and I
dialog: don’t know if you even realize it
dialog: anymore.
dialog: (Hoover looks i11)
dialog: Edgar? You can lie to everyone
dialog: else. The whole world. For your own
dialog: sake, for the sake of the Bureau.
dialog: But you CANNOT lie to me.
text: Hoover is sweating. Toulson hands him a handkerchief.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: I should never have given you a
dialog: job. You know that, Clyde? You
dialog: weren’t qualified.
dialog: (Toulson readies for an attack)
dialog: Do you remember what you did in
dialog: your interview?
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: I don’t.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: You fixed my window... And you
dialog: found my handkerchief on the floor.
dialog: And you handed it to me... Do you
dialog: know why I was sweating?
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: Because you were exercising.
text: And Hoover dabs his forehead with Toulson’s handkerchief.
text: Toulson doesn’t interrupt, he refolds the handkerchief.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: No. That was also a lie... I was
dialog: sweating because I knew that I
dialog: needed you... I’ve never needed
dialog: anyone else in my entire life. Not
dialog: like that. And I started to
dialog: perspire.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: (a long beat, then)
dialog: I know...
text: Hoover puts a hand on his chest, likely feigning indigestion -
text: - perhaps wanting a way out of this affectionate moment.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you okay?
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Yes. Indigestion... Would you like
dialog: to have dinner tomorrow night? At
dialog: our old place?
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: (he knows he can’t)
dialog: Perhaps if I feel better.
speaker_heading: OLD HOOVER
dialog: Then you must. We have a good many
dialog: things to discuss. I can’t depend
dialog: on anyone at the Bureau now.
text: And in his boldest show of affection in the film, Hoover
text: kisses Toulson’s forehead, holding his lips there for some
text: time. Toulson grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: OLD TOULSON
dialog: Thank you, Edgar.
text: And Hoover goes, trying to remain “J. Edgar Hoover” despite
text: the feelings rising up inside him.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S ADULTHOOD HOME - THAT NIGHT
text: Hoover walks into his home. Something seems off, but he can’t
dialog: figure it out.
text: He plays with HIS DOGS. They lead him to a portrait of his
text: Mom. It seems she is making eye contact with him. He
text: considers taking her down, but instead, straightens her. Now
dialog: all is right.
scene_heading: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
text: Richard Nixon is with his Chief of staff H.R. HALDEMAN. He’s
text: just gotten a piece of juicy news. He’s stunned.
speaker_heading: RICHARD NIXON
dialog: Jesus Christ! That old cocksucker!
speaker_heading: H.R. HALDEMAN
dialog: I’‘ll get a speech prepared. We
dialog: should go on Television.
speaker_heading: RICHARD NIXON
text: Not yet. First seal off his office.
dialog: Change the locks. Do whatever you
dialog: have to. I want those fucking
dialog: files.
dialog: 117.
scene_heading: INT. HELEN GANDY’S OFFICE —- MORNING
text: Helen shows up to work as usual. Cool as Ice. Her phone
text: rings. She takes the call in stride, and makes a simple note
text: in her ledger -- “CALL: HOOVER HOUSEKEEPER. ANNIE.” She
text: walks back to her office door, and closes it.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S ADULTHOOD HOME - MORNING
text: Old Toulson struggles up the stairs behind A MAID. When they
text: reach Hoover’s bedroom door, she stops. She’s not going in.
text: Toulson takes a beat, considers the door. He’s never been in
text: the room. He pushes it open. REVEAL: it’s filled with Ming
text: vases, porcelain Foo dogs, Buddhas, ivory elephants, AND A
text: MULTITUDE OF NUDE MALE STATUES displayed on mahogany tables
text: draped in lace. This is Hoover’s hidden world. Any light that
text: might try and get in is blocked by Chinese screens.
text: And there, lying on the floor in his silk pajama bottoms is
text: the body of J. Edgar Hoover. Toulson kneels next to the body,
text: and lovingly closes his eyes. Hoover has passed.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S ADULTHOOD HOME / BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Toulson finds a stack of files sitting on the bedside table.
text: On top is the manuscript of his unfinished book. He picks it
text: up. Under it is the King’s sex tape transcript, and a folder
text: labeled “Eleanor Roosevelt.” He opens it and pulls out a
text: photostat of a letter. As he reads it, we hear a replay of
dialog: Young Edgar reading it years ago.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HOOVER (V.O.)
dialog: “Funny how even the dearest face
dialog: will fade away in time. Most
dialog: clearly I remember your eyes, with
text: a kind of teasing smile in them,
dialog: and the feeling of that soft spot
text: just northeast of the corner of
dialog: your mouth against my lips.”
dialog: It’s the lesbian love letter to Eleanor that Edgar once
text: rolled with laughter at. It seems he liked to keep it close
dialog: and read it often.
scene_heading: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - INTERCUT
dialog: Broadcast of the President
speaker_heading: RICHARD NIXON (V.O.)
dialog: It can truly be said of him that he

dialog: 118.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S OUTER AND INNER OFFICES - SAME TIME
text: NIXON’S MEN barge into Hoover’s old office, seal it off, and
text: search for his secret files. They stand guard at the door,
text: not letting anyone in or out.
speaker_heading: RICHARD NIXON (V.O.)
dialog: --His magnificent contribution to
dialog: making this a great and good nation
dialog: will be remembered by the American
dialog: people long after the petty
text: carpings and vicious criticisms of
text: his detractors are forgotten.
scene_heading: INT. HELEN GANDY’S OFFICE - SAME TIME
text: It’s too late. Helen already has her boss’s private filing
text: cabinets safely in her office. And as the President’s men
text: search Hoover’s office and change his locks, she quietly dips
text: the last of his files into the shredder.
speaker_heading: RICHARD NIXON (V.O.)
dialog: The FBI he literally created and
dialog: built is today universally regarded
dialog: as the finest law-enforcement
dialog: agency in the world.
scene_heading: INT. HOOVER’S ADULTHOOD HOME / BEDROOM - DAY
text: Toulson lays down in Hoover’s untouched bed, holding the old

speaker_heading: RICHARD NIXON
dialog: The FBI is the eternal monument
dialog: honoring this great American.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
text: TITLE CARDS ON BLACK:
text: The contents of Hoover’s “private and personal” files will
text: never be known. Only a few clues from misfiled items have
dialog: ever surfaced.
dialog: Clyde Toulson inherited Hoover's estate, moved into his
text: house, and accepted the U.S. flag draped over his coffin.
text: Clyde Toulson's grave is a few yards from Hoover's in the
dialog: Congressional Cemetery.
