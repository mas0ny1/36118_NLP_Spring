scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - (FIFTEEN YEARS AGO) - DUSK 2
text: Where TWO YOUNG CHINESE BROTHERS (PO AND HAN) fight for
text: their lives atop a jagged skyline of breaking whitecaps.
text: CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL...
dialog: The sea has never seemed more violent, dancing and
text: choking them from swell to swell. The makeshift raft
text: keeping them afloat nothing but a tattered basketball.
text: Yet they doggedly cling together, a shared dream and
text: their love for each other conspiring to keep them alive.
dialog: Welcome to the eight-hour escape from Mainland China to
dialog: the promise of a new life in Hong Kong.
speaker_heading: TIGHTER
text: As Younger Brother (HAN) starts slipping away, losing his
text: tender grasp on the raft and survival. Older brother
text: (PO) sees this and makes a desperate lunge to help...
text: For a sickening moment Han is swallowed whole by the dark

scene_heading: EXT. WATERFRONT CASINO - OAKLAND - NIGHT 6
text: A thriving gambling and dancing joint set amongst the

scene_heading: INT. WATERFRONT CASINO - PLUSH BOOTH - NIGHT 7
text: Where PO SUNG (MID 30'S) drains off his third vodka

text: Po smiles lazily as the girl's tongues touch in a brief
text: flicker. Rotates the bone handle of his cane back to
text: reveal a small coke stash. Casually dips a nail and does
text: a bump.
speaker_heading: WIDER SHOT
dialog: As WE REALIZE they're the only Asians in the place. A

dialog: Chinese...
speaker_heading: BAD-ASS
dialog: Leave a twenty for the drinks and
dialog: crawl the fuck outta here.
text: The MUSIC DIES OFF, leaving a searing tension in its

dialog: indifference.
speaker_heading: PO
dialog: It's all good, Bra, no worries.
dialog: I'm simply waiting to talk to a
dialog: friend...
speaker_heading: BAD-ASS
dialog: You don't have any friends in this

text: Sung Family enforcer, KAI (LATE 20'S), walks the point.
text: This guy would have Van Damme crapping his pants inside a
text: minute -- his face reflects that. Sunglasses are canted
text: to reveal hard eyes and the bad attitude to go with ‘em.
speaker_heading: KAL
dialog: Let it go, Po. This is a hassle
dialog: we don't need.
text: Po shrugs. Another lazy smile. But the Bad-Ass sticks a
text: hand into his chest keeping him from sliding out.
text: Po SWIFTLY STRIKES, -- the cane just a vague blur as it
text: CHOPS the hand down, CRACKS ribs on both sides, then
text: BUTTS the guy flush on the temple with the bone handle.
dialog: Kai shoots hima “What the fuck's wrong with you" look as

text: the guy's knee so quickly that his foot is back on the
dialog: ground by the time WE HEAR the ACL SNAP,... The enforcer
text: BOXES HIS EARS on the way down with a DEAFENING CLAP.
text: Kai calmly breast-pockets his shades. Then in the blink
dialog: of an eye it's on...
scene_heading: FULL VIEW - THE BATTLE
text: As A BRUTAL MELEE ERUPTS across the casino. We're
text: treated to a perfect blending of Martial Arts and Street,
text: EXTREME HAND-TO-HAND STUFF showcasing the better elements
dialog: of both...
text: One of the blacks CLOTHESLINES a Chinese throat... Two
text: others TRADE OPEN SHOTS Hagler/Hearns-style until one
text: simply drops...
text: Kai leads the pack, racking ass at a furious pace. He

dialog: But one bad apple spoils the fun. A Chinese is the first
dialog: to go for his piece. Now a really nice moment as A DAISY
text: CHAIN OF HANDGUNS ARE DRAWN SIMULTANEOUSLY, dropping into
text: place like a row of dominos...
text: Black gun jammed to Chinese temple -- an Asian .45 stuck
text: in black's belly -- Mr. 45's spine scissored by a pair of
dialog: -380's, and so on...
text: A long beat. Both sides teetering on the brink of
