speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. PRAGUE - NIGHT
text: On a hill above the city is an old CATHEDRAL. The night is
text: spooky, with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones
dialog: and medieval walls.
text: A NERVOUS YOUNG HACKER makes his way down an alley.
text: There is a DOOR at the end of the alley. MUSIC can be faintly
text: heard from inside.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: High above the street an INTRUDER DRESSED ALL IN BLACK spies
text: from the roof. He's watching with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.
text: He pulls out a CROSSBOW and FIRES.
text: A BOLT flies, trailing CABLE.
text: THUNK! It sticks into the alley wall below.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT
text: As he passes by the ominous Cathedral, the Hacker spins,
dialog: sure he's heard something.
text: But there's nothing there. He continues on.
text: Then the Intruder comes sliding down the ZIP-LINE from above.
text: WHAM! He kicks the Hacker into the wall, knocking him out.
text: The Intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled
text: features of a dashing BRITISH SECRET AGENT. His name is
text: STERLING.
speaker_heading: STERLING
dialog: I hate to drop in unexpectedly.
text: Sterling searches the Hacker and pulls a SMALL BLACK CASE
text: from his coat. Inside the case is a DATA CHIP. Sterling tucks
dialog: it away.
text: Sterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp TUXEDO
text: underneath. He pulls out CAR KEYS. In a quick insert we see
text: the "ASTON-MARTIN" LOGO.
text: As he strolls back out the alley, he HEARS something and
text: flattens against the wall.
text: A BLACKED OUT SUV screeches to a stop, blocking his exit.
text: The SUV's HEADLIGHTS illuminate the slumped Hacker.
text: BAD GUYS get out to investigate, pulling out weapons.
text: Cornered, Sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in
text: the shadows. He gets to that DOOR the Hacker was heading
dialog: towards.
text: As he PICKS THE LOCK Sterling can hear MUSIC from inside. He
text: smooths his hair and prepares to "blend in" with the crowd.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
text: Sterling comes through the door and his face falls. He's
text: stepped into a loud METAL CONCERT.
text: We see a GO-GO DANCER in LATEX. Onstage is RAMMSTEIN, a
text: bizarre German industrial-metal band.
text: The tattooed YOUNG CROWD slam dances and swings glo-stix
text: over their heads. Some wear rubber BRAIN SKULLCAPS outfitted
text: with fiber optic lights. It's a sea of SPIKED HAIR and BONDAGE
speaker_heading: OUTFITS.
text: Sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd.
text: With his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken
dialog: coop.
text: ON THE BALCONY ABOVE THE CROWD stands a wild haired young
text: GANGSTER with PIERCED BROWS. With him is a STREET-TOUGH GIRL
text: with multi-colored hair. They look like a post-Apocalyptic
text: Bonnie &amp; Clyde. They are YORGI and PETRA.
text: Yorgi checks his watch. His delivery is late. Then his CELL
text: PHONE rings. He's getting the news from outside.
text: He looks down, spots Sterling amidst the moshing crowd. With
text: that look, that tux, there's no mistaking what he is.
text: They make EYE CONTACT and Sterling gives a little nod.
text: Yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone.
text: Immediately VIKTOR starts moving in Sterling's direction.
text: Viktor is huge, with a MOHAWK and a six-inch GOATEE.
text: Sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit, pushing
text: through the freaky crowd.
scene_heading: EXT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
text: Sterling's ASTON-MARTIN VANTAGE screeches away from the curb.
scene_heading: INT. ASTON-MARTIN - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Sterling is at the wheel of his spy car. He plugs the DATA
text: CHIP into the dash and punches buttons. A computer screen
text: says "DATA DOWNLOADING".
text: He sees a BLACKED-OUT SUV racing up behind him.
text: He accelerates and hits a SWITCH.
text: ARMORED PLATING slides up over the rear window.
scene_heading: EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT
text: The SUV is right behind him. Viktor rolls down the passenger
text: window, readies his PISTOL.
text: The rear bumper of the spy car opens. SMOKE BOMBS drop out.
text: They explode in MASSIVE CLOUDS, obscuring the narrow, street.
text: Sterling skids around a corner.
text: The blinded bad guys drive straight into a STOREFRONT. Glass
text: and merchandise flies as the SUV gets stuck.
text: The Aston-Martin rounds another corner and slides to a stop.
text: Blocking the road ahead are two more SUV's.
text: A MOTORCYCLE slides to a stop in front of them. The rider is
text: ANDERS, a leather clad biker who looks half Viking.
text: Anders pulls out a SILENCED SUB-MACHINE GUN and starts
text: BLASTING.
text: BULLETS SLAM into the Aston-Martin, cracking the bullet-proof
text: glass, shattering headlights, and BLOWING OUT THE FRONT TIRES!
text: Sterling jams it into reverse and backs around the corner on
speaker_heading: the RIMS.
scene_heading: INT. ASTON-MARTIN - IDLING - NIGHT
text: Sterling notices an ERROR MESSAGE now flashing on his computer
scene_heading: screen: "TRANSMISSION ERROR: - DATA PARTIALLY SENT".
text: Sterling looks around desperately. Somehow he's got to get
dialog: this data out of here.
text: Straight ahead is the RIVER. Chugging up the river: a PARTY
speaker_heading: BARGE.
text: PARTYGOERS in formal attire dance to an orchestra. A SWIMMING
text: POOL is in the middle of the deck for a perfect water landing.
speaker_heading: STERLING
dialog: Time for a slow boat to China.
text: He hits a BUTTON.
scene_heading: EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT
text: The rear license plate folds down, revealing a ROCKET ENGINE.
text: Flames spew as he jams down the accelerator.
text: Sterling is pushed back into his seat by the G-forces.
text: SPARKS fly from the rims as he skips across the pavement at
text: ever increasing speed.
text: Anders FIRES with his gun, but Sterling is getting away!
text: But then KIRILL steps around the corner. He's academic
text: looking, a CHAIN SMOKING intellectual with COKE-BOTTLE
text: GLASSES. He's also a highly proficient and cold-blooded
speaker_heading: SNIPER.
text: Kirill puts his lit cigarette behind his ear and unslings a
scene_heading: SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE LAUNCHER from his shoulder.
text: The Aston-Martin reaches the riverbank and goes AIRBORNE. It
text: ROCKETS through the air towards the party barge.
text: We see the car REFLECTED in Kirill's glasses as he AIMS.
text: On a little SCREEN we see the missile launcher HOME IN on
text: the HEAT SOURCE of the jet engine.
text: The missile locks-in and FIRES...
text: HEATSEEKER P.O.V. - we see a GREEN CAR with all its hot spots
text: GLOWING RED. Camera ROARS towards the flying car.
scene_heading: INT. ASTON-MARTIN - FLYING - NIGHT
text: Sterling sees the missile streaking at him.
speaker_heading: STERLING
dialog: Oh bloody hell!
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVER - NIGKT
text: WHOOMPH! The Aston-Martin EXPLODES in mid-air.
text: Partygoers shriek as the AXLE and FLAMING RIMS rain down on
dialog: the deck.
text: Kirill takes the cigarette from his ear, PUFFS IT.
text: Finally, Sterling's flaming BOW TIE flutters down and lands
text: on a LEAPING SALMON ICE-SCULPTURE above a tantalizing SEAFOOD
speaker_heading: BUFFET.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C.
text: A STRAFING SHOT over the city. We make a sudden left turn
text: and SPEED OUT OF TOWN.
text: We shoot over to the BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS of VIRGINIA. In
text: the middle of NOWHERE we dive towards a COMPLEX OF BLACK
text: BUILDINGS.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Inside it's modern, cold and high tech. An elevator COUNTS
text: DOWN to a deep basement level.
text: The doors open and a TALL MAN man with a PROSTHETIC LEG
text: strides down the empty hall. AGENT GIBBONS is African-
text: American, a battle-scarred WARRIOR. Even with a limp he looks
text: sturdy, confident, deadly.
text: At the end of the hall is a METAL DOOR.
scene_heading: INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Gibbons walks into the INFORMATION ROOM of the NATIONAL
scene_heading: SECURITY AGENCY (NSA). There are WORLD MAPS, SATELLITE IMAGES
text: on COMPUTER SCREENS, TECHIES monitoring everything.
dialog: If a nuclear war broke out, you could run the country from
dialog: down here.
text: Gibbons takes an elevator up.
scene_heading: INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: The office is expensive yet devoid of personality, reflecting
text: the shadowy nature of it's owner. One wall is GLASS, looking
text: down on the information room. SAM TANNICK, grizzled NSA chief,
text: looks down at the activity below.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: Come.
text: Gibbons enters, stands by the desk.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Evening, Sam.
text: Sam remains in shadow.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: What do you have?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Not a whole helluva lot. His final
dialog: transmission was mangled. About
dialog: something or someone called "Ahab".
dialog: Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: He was the best there was. That makes
text: three agents lost.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: They're ruthless and they have a lot
dialog: of firepower. It's only a matter of
dialog: time before they figure out how to
dialog: deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna
dialog: have a catastrophe on our hands.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
text: Silent Night in the hands of a bunch
dialog: of impertinent cowboys
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: We're gonna have to step in, Sam.
dialog: Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown
dialog: in a field of cactus. Let me take
dialog: care of it.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: How will you fix it?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: I'll go in with a team. But first
dialog: I'm going to need some intel. I'll
dialog: have to put someone inside, someone
dialog: new, someone they won't see coming.
dialog: One of their own.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: So you'll dredge the bottom again.
dialog: You've done that before. The results
dialog: were... uneven.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: You wanna find out about rats, ask a
dialog: rat. I've had my people put together
dialog: a talent pool. I downloaded it to
dialog: your desktop.
text: Gibbons snaps on the giant FLATSCREEN on Sam's desk. He starts
text: cycling through PHOTO AFTER PHOTO of TOUGH LOOKING MEN.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: The usual prospects. Convicts,
dialog: contract killers, murde...
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: The scum of the Earth.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: But programmable. And expendable.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: I've seen enough. Turn it off.
text: Gibbons clicks off the screen.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: They're degenerates. There's not a
dialog: man in there that would give a damn
dialog: if the Chinese took over.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: That's exactly why we need them.
text: Sam sighs, stares out at the information room.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: Get these "scum", Mr. Gibbons, bring
dialog: them in. Test them. Train them. Find
dialog: your man.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT
text: The huge ARCO TOWER rises up towards a moonlit sky.
scene_heading: We see ACCOMPLICE #1 (TRAVIS PASTRANA) sneak up and take
text: position behind a FOUNTAIN.
text: ACCOMPLICE #2 (CAREY HART) sneaks across a roof and takes
text: position overlooking the fountain position of #1.
speaker_heading: ACCOMPLICE #3 (DAVE MIRRA) takes up position in the second
text: story window of a FLOPHOUSE HOTEL down the street.
text: A MESSENGER (BOB BURNQUIST) skates up to the front of the
text: skyscraper with a PACKAGE. He gets the attention of the
text: SECURITY GUARD inside. The Security Guard unlocks the door
text: and lets him in.
text: Just then a VAN pulls up and ACCOMPLICES #4 (SHAUN PALMER)
text: and #5 (MAT HOFFMAN) hop out. They open up the back and a
text: BICYCLE is rolled out of the back by a MAN IN A HOODED JACKET.
text: Jacket Man rolls the bike to the skyscraper and enters the
dialog: lobby.
scene_heading: INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - NIGHT
text: The Security Guard is checking his computer.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Crump... I'm sorry, no one by that
dialog: name.
text: K The Guard glances up as Jacket Man gets into an ELEVATOR.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Hey! You can't go up there!
text: The Security Guard rushes to intercept him. The Messenger
text: kicks his skateboard out, TRIPPING UP the Security Guard.
text: The Messenger hauls ass out the door. The Security Guard
text: pulls out his WALKIE-TALKIE.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: We've got an intruder in the express
dialog: elevator!
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: The button for "91 - ROOF ACCESS" is lit up. Jacket Man waits
dialog: patiently.
scene_heading: INT. 91ST FLOOR - NIGHT
text: This fancy office is empty for the night. The STAIRWELL DOOR
text: opens and a PLATOON of SECURITY GUARDS rushes in. They take
text: Up position in front of the elevator doors armed with BILLY
speaker_heading: CLUBS and TASERS.
text: DING! The elevator arrives and the door swings open. But
text: there's NOBODY INSIDE.
text: One Guard steps forward and suddenly a bicycle SWINGS DOWN
text: from the ceiling, TAGGING HIM IN THE FACE. He falls back,
text: TASERING another Guard.
text: Jacket Man drops down onto his bike and pedals through the
text: chaos before the Guards know what hit them. There's a CURVY
text: PIECE OF ART in the room, some kind of modern art statue.
text: Jacket Man rides up the artwork like a ramp and does a
text: TABLETOP AERIAL over a DIVIDER. He hits the ground pedalling,
text: the Guards hot after him.
text: Jacket Man enters a HUGE OPEN ROOM with a FIELD OF CUBICLES
text: in the middle. He bunny hops onto a desk and SLIDES TO A
text: STOP. He tosses back his hood and we get a good look at him
dialog: for the first time.
text: He is XANDER CAGE. He's got a shaved head, bizarre TATTOOS
text: all over his body and multiple PIERCINGS. He's lean and
text: heavily cut, even dangerous looking.
text: The Guards charge at him and he HOPS up onto the top of the
text: CUBICLE WALL. This thing is maybe FOUR INCHES WIDE and FIVE
scene_heading: FEET TALL.
text: He pedals across the top of the cubicle wall, the Guards
text: scrambling after him.
text: Xander bunny hops over one guy's head onto the next set of
text: cubicles and pedals hard. The Guards fall all over themselves
text: trying to catch him.
text: At the other end Xander catches air and lands on a CONFERENCE
text: TABLE. He does a WHEELIE across it's length with Guards
text: closing in.
text: Xander springs up and does a TAIL WHIP, knocking them back
text: with his rear wheel. He lands and pedals to the stairwell
dialog: untouched.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT
text: Xander bursts out of the stairwell to the top of the TALLEST
text: BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN LA. He climbs on a RAISED PLATFORM.
text: From here he can drop down onto another level that is strewn
text: with SATELLITE DISHES and MICROWAVE RELAYS.
text: Guards rush onto the roof and try to corral him.
text: Xander tears off his jacket, revealing a BACKPACK on his
text: back and VIDEO CAMERA on his chest. He pulls out a ROAD FLARE
text: and SPARKS IT. We see there are SOAKED RAGS tied to his
speaker_heading: SPOKES.
text: He LIGHTS THEM with the flare. Then he TOSSES THE FLARE off
dialog: the building.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT
text: The Accomplices see the flare drop. #'s 1, 2 &amp; 3 pull CAMERAS
text: OUT and start filming.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT
text: Xander races around the roof like a trapped animal. He evades
text: Security Guards, picking up speed.
text: With Guards right behind, he drops off the TOP PLATFORM and
text: lands on a massive SATELLITE DISH.
text: Using the dish as a ramp, Xander LAUNCHES himself OFF THE
text: TOP OF THE BUILDING. We're talking 90 some stories here.
text: He spins through the air, his bike on fire. He's doing end
dialog: over end backflips. One... Two... Three... Four...
text: He's looping through space on his bike, a crazy man on a
text: flaming bike against a backdrop of sleek skyscrapers and
dialog: night lights.
text: The stunt is covered by the various Accomplices and Xander's
text: own chest camera, in SUPER 8 and DIGITAL VIDEO, from four
dialog: different angles.
text: Xander ditches the bike, kicking it away from him and plummets
text: towards the ground.
text: At the last moment he throws out a "bucket" and his PARACHUTE
speaker_heading: OPENS.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT
text: The bicycle comes flying down and SMASHES into the pavement.
text: It bounces a full TWO STORIES back up before coming to rest.
text: Xander glides down and makes his landing. Accomplices #4 and
text: #5 rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the
text: van. SIRENS APPROACH as the van makes it's escape.
text: As COP CARS screech up to the skyscraper, one of them RUNS
text: OVER the smoking wreckage of the bike.
speaker_heading: SLAM TO:
text: TITLE SEQUENCE - HARDCORE MUSIC plays as we see a flowing
text: TAPESTRY OF FLORID TATTOOS. SILHOUETTED against this backdrop
text: we see the OUTLINES of NUDE WOMEN riding BMX BIKES in a HALF-
text: PIPE, BLADING ever obstacles, SKY SURFING and doing street
text: SKATE TRICKS. It's a collision of outlandish imagery that
dialog: tells you one thing: This ain't your daddy's spy movie.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
text: Xander, now on a MOTORCYCLE, zips through traffic. He's
text: smiling, leaning it way over on the turns. He's got another
text: BACKPACK on his back.
scene_heading: EXT. LOFT DISTRICT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT
text: Xander drives his motorcycle into the garage of his building.
scene_heading: INT. XANDER'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A FREIGHT ELEVATOR rises up, bringing Xander and his
text: motorcycle into the loft.
text: There are EXTREME SPORTS ACTION POSTERS on the walls,
text: MOTORCYCLE PARTS and BARBELLS on the floor, and everywhere
text: there's EXTREME SPORTS EQUIPMENT of every description.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Sky, you there? Start packin' cause
dialog: we are out of here!
text: There's a NEATLY FOLDED FLAG hanging in a slightly crooked
text: FRAME on the wall. Xander straightens it as he goes by.
text: He hears her in the sectioned off "bedroom" and heads back
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Did I promise you a fat vacation or
dialog: what? Get ready to get down in
dialog: paradise.
text: He comes into the bedroom to find SKY, his long-suffering
dialog: girlfriend. She's a wannabe artist type. She's got SUITCASES
text: and BOXES scattered around and she's PACKING.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Hey, you don't need all this just to
dialog: go on vacation. Unless this ain't
dialog: for going on vacation...
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: I'm through, Xander.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I can see that. Why?
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: You run around with maniacs jumping
dialog: motorcycles in the desert, you break
text: 36 bones crashing wave runners and
text: snowboarding off cliffs, all with no
dialog: health insurance... It's insane, I
dialog: can't take it anymore.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'm having fun, what's the problem?
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: You have all this talent, and you
dialog: waste it. You won't take a single
dialog: endorsement deal. Meanwhile those
dialog: other guys have their own video games!
dialog: But no, you've got too much
dialog: "integrity" for that.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I don't wanna go mersh, you know
dialog: that. But hey, if this is about
dialog: money...
text: He opens up the backpack, revealing WADS OF CASH.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I got an advance on the next bootleg.
dialog: Let's get out of here, just you and
dialog: me. We'll chill out in Bora Bora for
dialog: a couple months.
text: She sorts through the money.
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: French Polynesia? This wouldn't last
dialog: us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you
dialog: know how expensive it is down there?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Alright, so I'll get more.
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: It's not about the money, X! You
dialog: never plan for anything. I can't
dialog: live like that anymore, I need some
dialog: stability.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd
dialog: better give you your surprise now.
text: He pulls off his shirt. Pierced through his nipple is a
scene_heading: DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: What...?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I was gonna wait till the islands,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: You're serious?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Of course I'm serious. I bought it,
dialog: didn't I?
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: This is so typical. I can't believe
dialog: you. I've barely seen you for the
dialog: last three weeks and now this? Are
dialog: you out of your mind?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I don't know. I thought this is what
dialog: you wanted. You want stability, here
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: You can't just propose to me out of
dialog: nowhere. You think that's going to
dialog: solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It
dialog: was a kick for a while, but it's
dialog: over. You're just not going anywhere.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You're not exactly "going anywhere"
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: You're wrong about that. I'm heading
dialog: out that door right now.
text: She heads towards the front door.
text: Just then the door BLOWS IN.
text: CRASH! -- the windows SMASH IN too. Then the LIGHTS GO OUT
text: as STORMTROOPERS in black body armor rush in, weapons drawn.
text: It's a blur of FLASHLIGHTS, PISTOLS and JACK BOOTS. It's
text: scary as hell. A professional take-down.
text: They slam Xander against the wall.
text: Just like that it's quiet again. Sky hyperventilates, a gun
text: in her face.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: She had nothing to do with the tower
dialog: jump. She's nobody. I just met her
dialog: last night. Tell them.
dialog: (with meaning)
dialog: I hardly know you.
text: The Stormtrooper looks at Sky. She nods. The Stormtroopers
text: take their guns off her.
text: Sky grabs up here stuff. She looks back at Xander.
speaker_heading: SKY
dialog: Keep the ring. It looks better on
dialog: you anyways.
text: She heads out.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: God, I hate cops. What's the charges
dialog: this time?
text: The Stormtrooper pulls out a DART GUN and SHOOTS Xander. He
text: pulls a CHROME DART from his chest, examines it.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: You... pussies...
text: Xander slides to the floor.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. PAN'S DINER - DAY
text: A SIDEWAYS IMAGE: an out of focus COFFEE CREAMER.
text: Xander wakes up with his head on the counter of a DINER. He
text: shakes out the cobwebs.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What the hell?
text: WHIP PAN as a WAITRESS walks by. Xander blinks.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Hey. Where am I? How did I get here?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I don't know, you wandered in ten
dialog: minutes ago and put your head down.
dialog: I told you we were closing.
text: Xander looks around, sees a TRUCKER chewing with his mouth
text: open. A SALESMAN buried in his NEWSPAPER.
text: Xander gets up. Where the hell is he? He takes a step towards
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Want some coffee?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Huh?
text: The Waitress pours him coffee. QUICK PUSH TO: her hands are
dialog: shaking.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Fine, just fine. Come on and sit.
dialog: I'll get you something to eat.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Yeah, sure.
text: Xander sits. When he swigs his coffee, he notices something
text: written on his napkin in shaky ballpoint: "S.O.S."
text: What the hell? He looks at the Trucker. The Trucker's staring
text: at the waitress. QUICK PUSH TO: The Trucker has a BULGE
text: underneath his vest... then PUSH TO: The Salesman's eyes
text: darting about suspiciously, newspaper pulled up to his nose.
dialog: Something is going down...
text: He hears a SLOWED DOWN VOICE and glances back at the Trucker,
text: who's now fixing him with a DEATH STARE. Xander snaps from
text: his reverie.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: I said, you got a problem, boy?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Problem? No, no problem. You go right
dialog: ahead.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: With what? I said, go right on ahead
dialog: with what?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Whatever, dude.
text: The Trucker and the Salesman look at each other. Suddenly
text: they jump up.
text: The Trucker pulls a PISTOL from his vest, the Salesman
text: brandishes the SHOTGUN he had behind the paper. The Waitress
text: cringes.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: Alright, nobody make a move!
dialog: (to Xander)
dialog: Shoulda walked away when you had the
dialog: chance, dumb shit.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Forget him, Buck, let's just do it.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: Shut up!
dialog: (in Xander's face)
dialog: You keep still or I'm gonna make
dialog: damn sure you stop breathing today.
dialog: Got that?
text: Xander stays strangely calm, his senses now fully focused.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Alright, "Buck", whatever you say.
text: The Waitress let's out a whimper.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty
dialog: that register! Couldn't just let him
dialog: leave, could ya! You know what I'm
dialog: gonna do to ya for that? Huh? Do
dialog: ya?!
text: She goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses
text: on the floor. Xander springs into action.
text: He CHOPS down on the Trucker's arm and ELBOWS him in the
dialog: face.
text: Xander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out
text: from under him.
text: The Salesman pumps on his shotgun, but it seems to be jammed.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Better shoot me quick.
text: The Salesman fights with his gun but can't get it to work.
text: Xander advances on him.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Too late!
text: He unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw.
text: The Salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors.
text: Xander turns to the terrified Waitress.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Alright, bitch, what's going on?
text: She stares at him, unable to speak. He raises the gun.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Talk! What's the game? Who are you
dialog: people?
text: The front door bell JINGLES. A guy with an impeccably tailored
text: suit and a cane hobbles in. It's Gibbons. There a problem,
dialog: Mr. Cage?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: The name's Gibbons. You were saying?

dialog: What is this place?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
text: Looks like a diner.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the
dialog: problem is. I wake up drugged to
dialog: find what? You've got a "salesman"
dialog: over here reading a three week old
text: newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a
dialog: "trucker", who happens to be packing
dialog: a cop issue H&amp;K 9mm. I get tipped
dialog: that something is going down when
dialog: she passes me a note. How's that for
dialog: twisted logic? How did she know there
dialog: was trouble unless they pulled the
dialog: guns before I "walked" in? And if
dialog: that's true, why'd they stop and
dialog: wait until I woke up to gaffle the
dialog: money? Then I notice how beefy they
dialog: both are. Hell, even the waitress is
text: cut. All three of them look like
dialog: they went through the same training
dialog: program. Ergo they ain't strangers
dialog: and this isn't what it seems. That's
dialog: how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round
dialog: off even if I gave him all day. Why?
text: He aims at the Waitress and FIRES! She's startled, but unhurt.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Cuz there's nothing but blanks in
dialog: these guns. And no offense, but their
dialog: performances were terrible.
text: Xander tosses the gun on the counter. Gibbons gives a sly
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Not bad. Not bad at all. Have a seat.
text: Gibbons sits in a booth. Xander sits across from him. In the
text: background the Waitress helps the Trucker and Salesman up.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Most guys we ran through this either
dialog: took off or helped them rob the place.
dialog: I expected you to do the same.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: That shows me already that you don't
dialog: have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Whether you thought this was for
dialog: real or not, you jumped in and helped
text: the waitress on instinct. That tells
dialog: me something about your character.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Good for you. Now why don't you stop
dialog: wasting my time and tell me what you
dialog: want. You didn't go through all this
dialog: for my benefit.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: It's your lucky day. You just might
dialog: get the chance to pay back our
dialog: wonderful country for all the freedom
dialog: you enjoy.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else
dialog: would have this kind of budget? Now
dialog: you're gonna hit me with the sales
dialog: pitch.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Alright, Cage, you've got me. This
dialog: is one of those moments. "Many are
dialog: called, few are chosen", that kind
dialog: of thing. Your government needs you.
dialog: Are you up for the challenge?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: ..If you're trolling around for narcs,
dialog: man, have you got the wrong guy.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Look at me, dude, do I look like a
dialog: fan of law enforcement? Forget the
dialog: tests, you shoulda just asked me. I
dialog: woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Oh I don't know, I think the tests
dialog: work pretty well. Sometimes they
dialog: give me answers you wouldn't admit
dialog: to in a million years.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Are we done now? You've got nothing
dialog: on me. So if you ain't booking me,
dialog: I'm walking.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: You've got this wrong. You're not
dialog: under arrest, you've been abducted.
dialog: And until I say different, you belong
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Is that a fact?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling
dialog: about you from the start, Cage. It's
dialog: nausea.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You know what I hate? Any scumbag
text: with a clean shirt and a bad haircut
dialog: can get one of those tin stars and
dialog: suddenly they think they're God.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You know what I hate? It's always
dialog: the assholes that pass the tests.
text: There's a POP and Xander clutches his stomach. Gibbons tosses
text: his DART GUN onto the table. Xander blinks at him.
text: He pulls another CHROME DART from his gut and examines it.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You bastards love to see me sleep.
text: WHACK! He goes face down on the table.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK:
scene_heading: CLOSE ON - XANDER'S FACE
text: He comes to, blinking in low RED LIGHT. He's shocked to find
dialog: that he's...
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE - TWILIGHT
text: Xander's on the floor of a military aircraft. TWO OTHER TOUGH
text: GUYS are waking up next to him. One's a greaser named VIRG,
text: the other is T.J., ex-Navy.
text: Xander notices as they each pull out CHROME DARTS. They sit
text: up, looking at each other. Xander chuckles.
speaker_heading: VIRG
dialog: What's so damn funny?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Been to any good diners lately?
text: The three laugh, realizing they're all in the same boat.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: We must be the final "candidates".
text: They quiet down as they notice for the first time, THEY ARE
dialog: NOT ALONE.
text: Sitting silently on benches facing them are SOLDIERS DRESSED
text: IN BLACK. They wear BLACK MASKS over their faces. They are a
text: nasty looking BLACK OPS TEAM.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Nobody told me this was a costume
dialog: party.
text: The Black Ops Team, just stares.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: I've worked with guys like this
dialog: before. Black Ops. Serious government
text: spooks.
text: Virg notices something STRAPPED TO HIS BODY. They all have
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: VIRG
dialog: Heads up, man. What's this thing on
dialog: my back?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: A parachute. This does not argue
dialog: well.
text: Then the red light switches to GREEN.
text: One of the Soldiers opens the JUMP DOOR. The rest of the
text: team advances on Xander, Virg and T.J.
speaker_heading: VIRG
dialog: This is bullshit! Hey!
text: They drag Virg to the door and THROW HIM OUT. T.J. goes next,
text: kicking and fighting.
text: Then they turn on Xander.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I get the picture.
text: Xander jumps out on his own.
text: We see him tumbling away from the airplane. Far below his
text: chute BLOSSOMS OPEN.
scene_heading: EXT. A FIELD - TWILIGHT
text: We see three chutes coming down. The first two HIT HARD.
text: We ROCKET IN on the last chute as Xander lands like a pro.
text: The other guys run up to him. Then they hear SHOUTING in
speaker_heading: SPANISH.
speaker_heading: VIRG
dialog: Jee-zus, man! What the hell now?
dialog: Another damn test?
dialog: T.J.
dialog: We should head for those trees.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Don't look at me, brother. It's every
dialog: man for himself.
text: They wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as
text: they TAKE OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.
text: Xander runs low down a culvert. There's SHOUTING all around.
text: He flattens down and crawls up over the rise. What he sees
text: stuns him.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You gotta be kidding me.
text: We crane up to reveal A FIELD OF POT PLANTS. There's a COCAINE
text: PROCESSING PLANT along the field's edge. The whole place
text: looks exactly like a Central American DRUG FARM.
text: NARCO TERRORISTS run around with AK-47's.
text: Xander sneaks past EQUIPMENT covered in CAMOUFLAGE NETTING.
text: A squad of Narcos runs by and Xander makes his move.
text: He rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the
text: HEADLIGHTS of a truck.
text: Narcos hop out and charge forward.
text: Xander raises his hands.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You boys are too good for me. Guess
dialog: I failed this one, huh?
text: They grab him and haul him away.
scene_heading: INT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT
text: We see a RUSTY MEAT HOOK. A CHAIN is wrapped around it.
text: Attached to the chain, his arms over his head, is Xander.
text: He's in the middle of a bleak looking room. There are
text: BLOODSTAINS on the wooden walls, the floor strewn with filthy
speaker_heading: HAY.
text: Behind him against the wall Xander sees T.J. and Virg both
speaker_heading: HOG-TIED.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: So much for "every man for himself".
dialog: Nice to see you again, fellas.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: They really went all out on this
text: one. This is a pretty gnarly setup.
speaker_heading: VIRG
text: Check the table in the corner.
text: There's a BLOOD STAINED TOWEL COVERING a TABLE near the door.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: This oughta be good.
text: Then they hear talking outside and the door is UNLOCKED.
text: A very nasty looking Marco comes in. By his look he's the
speaker_heading: LEADER.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: This must be el jefe. How's it goin'
dialog: jefe? Some weather we're havin'.
text: Narco Guards bring in one of their PARACHUTES and toss it on
text: the floor. They exit, closing the door behind them.
text: Jefe goes to the table throws back the towel. Beneath it are
scene_heading: HIDEOUS, BLOOD ENCRUSTED TORTURE DEVICES: a HACK SAW, a BOLT
scene_heading: CUTTERS, KNIVES, CHISELS, a BLOW TORCH.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What's on the menu tonight? The old
dialog: blowtorch-to-the-family jewels
dialog: routine, I'll bet. Hey, you want
dialog: roasted nuts, let's break out the
dialog: Planters.
text: T.J. and Virg both crack up. Jefe gives them a withering
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: JEFE
dialog: Do you know what we do with people
dialog: come round here? You know what we do
dialog: with people come in our business?
text: Jefe passes his hand over the various tools. He finally
text: settles on a crude MACHETE. He walks amongst them brandishing
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JEFE
dialog: We cut the Achilles tendon. Your
text: feet flop around like a marionette.
dialog: You ain't walkin' nowhere no more.
dialog: Sound good, tough guy? Or maybe
dialog: instead you wanna tell me something.
text: He stops in front of Xander.
speaker_heading: JEFE
dialog: Whatchu doing here?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
speaker_heading: JEFE
dialog: That's some accident, hombre. You
text: accidentally fall out of a plane in
text: the middle of the night and land up
dialog: in my back yard.
text: He BACKHANDS Xander across the face.
speaker_heading: JEFE
dialog: We seen this kind of parachutes
dialog: before, you know. U.S. Army. You got
dialog: some friends here, jump out with you
dialog: guys?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: We're anti-social. We don't have any
dialog: friends.
text: Jefe SLAPS him again.
speaker_heading: JEFE
dialog: No friends, huh? That's funny, I
dialog: don't know no U.S. Army that comes
dialog: without no friends. That's cuz U.S.
dialog: Army is pussies. They always come
dialog: with the five hundred guys and the
text: helicopters and the see-in-the-dark
dialog: glasses. So don't you tell me you
dialog: all alone out here, my friend. You
dialog: bullshitting the wrong guy.
text: Xander looks over at T.J. and Virg.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
speaker_heading: VIRG
dialog: He's a pretty good actor, though.
dialog: T.J.
text: Makes the diner look like a sixth
dialog: grade play. He's even got them crazy
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: JEFE
dialog: You ain't begun to see crazy yet,
dialog: amigo.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: We're on to the game, ese. You got
text: the fake blood splattered all over
dialog: the walls, you got your torture
dialog: tools... It's all very cute. But
dialog: come on, let's quit while you're
dialog: ahead. I'm only trying to save you a
dialog: beatin'.
speaker_heading: JEFE
dialog: You saving me? You talking pretty
dialog: tough for a guy got himself chained
text: to the ceiling.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Alright. You wanna eat through a
dialog: tube, be my guest.
speaker_heading: JEFE
dialog: Now you're gonna make me enjoy this,
dialog: funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the
dialog: whole foot off. Whatchu think of
dialog: that?
text: A low THUMPING is heard outside. It's the sound of approaching
text: HELICOPTERS, lots of them.
text: Then the night ERUPTS in GUNFIRE. It sounds like a full scale
text: assault outside.
speaker_heading: JEFE
dialog: What's that, eh? I thought you didn't
dialog: have no friends!
text: Jefe goes into a fury. He SWINGS his machete at Xander's
dialog: legs.
text: Xander JUMPS UP, grabbing on to the chain above, and KICKS
text: Jefe in the chest.
text: Jefe falls back and Xander climbs up to the roof BEAM.
text: He grabs onto the beam with his legs and UNHOOKS his chain
text: from the meat hook.
text: He drops down, six feet of chain still hanging from his cuffed
text: wrists, and Jefe comes charging at him.
text: Xander dodges a few wild swings.
text: He grabs Jefe's PANT CUFF and dumps him on his ass.
text: Jefe scrambles to his feet, drawing his PISTOL.
text: Xander swings his chain and WHIPS the gun out of Jefe's hand.
text: With another swing he WRAPS the chain around Jefe's neck and
dialog: pulls it taught.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Keys. You got 'em?
text: Jefe nods, choking, and reaches into his pocket.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Hand 'em to me.
text: Instead Jefe hurls them out the window.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I hope you're getting paid extra for
dialog: this.
text: Xander jerks the chain, slamming Jefe head first into the
text: wall. Jefe drops, knocked out.
text: Outside it sounds like a full scale FIREFIGHT. Xander gets
text: the machete and CUTS the ropes holding T.J. and Virg.
text: Then a HAIL OF BULLETS sprays through the room.
text: All three guys hit the deck but T.J. gets shot. He clutches
text: his side, BLOOD all over his hands.
dialog: T.J.
dialog: I'm hit! I'm hit!
speaker_heading: VIRG
dialog: They're shooting for real! This is
dialog: all real.
text: Xander knows this is true.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Aw shit.
text: He checks out T.J.'s wound.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Help me with this guy.
speaker_heading: VIRG
dialog: It's like you said, every man for
dialog: himself.
text: Virg bolts for the door.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: That only works if you're a man!
scene_heading: EXT. DRUG FARM - NIGHT
text: Narcos are shouting, running to and fro.
text: TRACER ROUNDS cut through the air. They are trying to repel
text: an UNSEEN ASSAULT FORCE.
text: Overhead SIX MILITARY HELICOPTERS buzz the compound like
text: Apocalypse Now, their NIGHT SUNS lighting up the place.
text: Xander comes out of the torture building holding T.J. in a
text: fireman's carry. His hands are still CUFFED, the length of
text: chain dragging.
text: Xander crouches behind some equipment, putting T.J. on the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You alright?
dialog: T.J.
dialog: I used to be a SEAL, it's not the
dialog: first time I've been shot. Thanks,
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Keep your head down, I'll be right
dialog: back. I'm gonna steal us some wheels.
text: Xander moves on, finds cover under the camouflage netting.
text: He can see Narcos shooting into the trees at the UNSEEN ENEMY.
text: Looking the other way, he spots Virg running back his way.
text: He's been corralled by one of the Helicopters.
text: He's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's Night
dialog: Sun.
text: Xander darts out and GRABS him, pulling him under the
text: camouflage netting.
speaker_heading: VIRG
dialog: They're all over the place! What the
dialog: hell's going on?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Looks like we're in the middle of
dialog: the drug war.
text: The Helicopter lights up the camouflage netting.
text: They're pinned down.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Alright Mr. free-for-all, you go
dialog: that way, I'm gonna go this way.
dialog: They can't follow us both.
text: They squat down in runners stances, the helicopter kicking
text: up DUST all around them.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Go!
text: They jet off in opposite directions.
text: Xander books, running for all he's worth. His cuffed hands
text: and the dangling chain make it difficult.
text: He's heading straight into the FIELD OF POT PLANTS.
text: Suddenly the massive SPOTLIGHT picks him out.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Shit!
text: The CHOPPER swoops down after him.
text: Its big GATLING GUNS turn, aiming right at him.
text: BRAAAAAAAAPPP! The guns cut loose, tearing up the ground
text: right behind him.
text: Xander sprints, the chopper after him like Cary Grant in
text: "North By Northwest", except instead of corn fields, Xander's
text: running through a field of HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS.
text: Xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him.
text: Xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the
dialog: plants.
text: All around him it's a chaos of Helicopters and GUNFIRE.
text: Two choppers attack the factory building, BLASTING it with
text: their guns. Narcos run terrified.
text: Xander notices a FAT PURPLE BUD on the plant right in front
text: of him. He SNAPS IT OFF.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'm gonna need to hit the trees after
dialog: a night like this.
text: He tucks it-into his shirt and takes off through the POT
speaker_heading: FOREST.
text: Xander finally spots a vehicle. It's a TRUCK LADEN WITH BAILS
text: OF COCAINE. He heads for it.
text: Then the SPOTLIGHT finds him again and the Chopper swings
text: around. The gatling guns RIP the plants to pieces all around
dialog: him.
text: Xander hauls ass, heading for the truck.
text: Bullets chew up the dirt all around him.
text: As the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns RAKE THE TRUCK.
text: There is a FLASH as the GAS TANK goes up.
text: WHOOOOPPHH! A SUPERNOVA OF FIRE AND HIGH-GRADE COKE erupts
text: into the night air.
text: Xander dives into a DRAINAGE DITCH. He tumbles down into
scene_heading: FILTHY WATER.
text: A powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white.
text: Near him is a big DRAINPIPE leeching sewage. Xander crawls
dialog: inside.
text: The Chopper makes another pass overhead.
text: The big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on.
text: Xander gives a sigh of relief. He crawls out of the drainpipe.
text: JEEPS race by on the road right above him as MILITARY MEN
dialog: flood the compound. There's no going back.
text: Xander turns and makes his way along the tree line.
text: The chopper and gunfire are in the distance now. Things are
text: quieter here and he starts to relax. Bad idea.
text: As he goes by, one of the TREES moves.
text: He takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on
text: EXPLODES UPWARDS. ARMS reach out, tackling Xander from behind.
text: Another TEAM of BLACK OPS SOLDIERS bursts from the weeds,
text: the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape.
text: They fall on him like a curtain.
text: XANDER'S P.O.V. - Soldiers hold him down while a BLACK HOOD
text: is pulled over his head.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - DAY
text: As the MASSIVE HANGER DOORS CLOSE we can see CHOPPERS taking
text: off and landing. MEXICAN SOLDIERS load Jefe and his Narcos
text: onto a FEDERALE BUS. Virg resists and is BEATEN. T.J. can be
text: seen being loaded into an AMBULANCE.
text: The hanger doors slide shut with a THUD.
text: We see Xander's HANDS as the CHAINS are cut away.
text: Xander sits in a chair with the BLACK HOOD still over his
text: head. He blinks when the hood is torn off. A Black Ops Soldier
text: smirks as he walks away.
text: Xander looks around, sees the Black Ops Team unpacking some
text: STRANGE GEAR. Two of them are dumping bottles of a CLEAR
text: LIQUID into a RUSTY CLAWFOOT BATHTUB.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Nice of you to draw me a bath. Is it
dialog: Saturday already?
text: The Black Ops guys grin knowingly.
text: On the other side, Xander sees a FLIGHT CREW readying a
text: GULFSTREAM for travel. Gibbons steps up from behind him.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Congratulations, you've just graduated
dialog: at the head of your class.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You're a cold piece of work. You
dialog: almost got three people killed out
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Good thing you were there to save
dialog: the day. Come walk with me.
text: Xander gets up and Gibbons leads him on a stroll around the
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: You've really got me confused, Cage.
dialog: On the one hand you showed leadership,
dialog: courage under fire, a willingness to
dialog: protect men you hardly knew... and
dialog: on the other you have an arrest record
dialog: that pegs you as near sociopathic.
dialog: Help me out here. I'm not following
dialog: your evolution.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You want the cheap backstory? The
dialog: runaway mom, the suicide dad and the
dialog: foster homes? Gimme a break. You're
dialog: not interested in my past, you're
dialog: interested in my future as some kind
dialog: of spy.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: You're perceptive too. I forgot to
dialog: add that to the list of surprises.
dialog: I'm with the National Security Agency.
dialog: And unlikely as it may sound, I need
dialog: your help.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'm not interested. I've already got
dialog: a job.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: You're an adrenaline junkie with one
dialog: foot in the penitentiary. You risk
dialog: your ass building a daredevil myth
dialog: that means nothing and you're not
dialog: getting any younger.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I plan on getting a lot older. And
dialog: playing spy games sounds like a quick
dialog: way to get yourself dead.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: That's too bad. I thought a guy like
dialog: you would appreciate the challenge.
text: As they walk by the Black Ops guys, Xander sees they're
text: getting busy. One spreads out a plastic DROPCLOTH. Another
text: plugs in a BONE SAW.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What's this? You're gonna try to
dialog: scare me now?
text: Gibbons grabs a CHICKEN LEG from a guy eating lunch.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Do you know the reason why I try to
dialog: recruit guys like you? There's no
dialog: risk.
text: He tosses it into the tub. Instantly it starts to SIZZLE and
text: BUBBLE. The tub is full of ACID.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: There's nobody back home who's gonna
dialog: ask questions if you just... disappear
dialog: for a while.
text: In seconds the entire leg has been consumed, leaving only a
text: oily cloud of residue.
text: Gibbons eyes him coldly, nailing the point home.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So
dialog: what's the deal? What do you need me
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: There's some folks I want to keep
text: tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized.
dialog: Your kind of people.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What do I get out of it?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: If you find out what I want to know,
dialog: and if I'm able to successfully use
dialog: that information, you get to go back
dialog: to your degenerate little life. If
dialog: not, you take a bath.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You're one sick bastard. A sadist
dialog: with a badge looking to rope me in
dialog: to a suicide mission. I think no
dialog: matter which way I go I'm likely to
text: wind up face down on a sheet of
dialog: plastic. So here's my answer: kiss
dialog: my ass, Hop-along.
text: Gibbons kicks the back of Xander's leg and dumps him on his
text: ass. Gibbons was so quick, Xander never saw it coming.
text: The Black Ops guys clap and cheer, always interested in a
dialog: fight.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Not bad for a gimp.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: What's with that "X" on the back of
dialog: your head? Does that mean you're
dialog: "extreme"? I've got some news for
dialog: you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser.
dialog: So maybe you should tattoo another
dialog: couple of X's on your head.
text: Xander gets up.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'll take that under advisement.
dialog: Maybe I can be like you and lose a
dialog: leg for the old Stars and Bars. I
dialog: bet the flag's a great comfort every
dialog: time you need help climbing stairs.
text: Gibbons lunges and grabs Xander's throat in the vice-like
text: grip of his thumb and middle finger.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: One twitch and my finger and thumb
dialog: will meet inside your esophagus.
dialog: Believe me, Mr. X, I've put foot to
dialog: ass for my country on many occasions
dialog: and I don't feel the urge to stop
dialog: just yet. So think carefully before
dialog: you tell me: Is "kiss my ass, Hop-
dialog: along" your final answer?
text: The fingers are so powerful that Xander is paralysed. He
text: looks over, sees the bone saw start revving.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (choking)
dialog: No.
text: Gibbons releases his grip.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: I thought you might see it my way.
text: Then Xander starts walking away.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Where you going, X? I said where you
dialog: going?
text: The Black Ops guys grab weapons, ready to stop him.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You tell me.
text: Xander climbs up the steps of the Gulfstream.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: There better be a movie on this Goddam
dialog: flight.
scene_heading: INT. GULFSTREAM - DAY
text: Xander sits with Gibbons in big leather chairs. They are
text: surrounded by NSA AGENTS in suits.
text: A NERDY AGENT snaps an ANKLET around Xander's ankle.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: How about a pedicure as long as you're
dialog: down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Wherever you go on the planet, I'll
dialog: find you. There's no quitting. If
dialog: you try to take it off, a ring of
dialog: needles will inject enough curare
dialog: into your bloodstream to kill you
dialog: before you hit the ground. Is all
dialog: that clear?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Yeah, I spy or I die.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - SUNSET
text: Orange light floods this beautiful airline lounge. There's a
text: fully stocked bar, a snack table, all unused. That's because
dialog: it's been sealed off for NSA use. (NOTE: perfect product
dialog: placement opportunity for an AIRLINE).
text: Xander, Gibbons and his Men are all silhouetted against the
text: smoked glass windows.
text: The Nerdy Agent hands Xander a Palm Pilot sized ELECTRONIC

speaker_heading: NERDY AGENT
dialog: This is your communicator. You'll
dialog: identify yourself by a call sign.
dialog: From here on out you're Bulldog Omega
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You must stay up late to come up
dialog: with shit like that.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: I expect you to call in regularly
dialog: with progress reports.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog
dialog: Omega 5.
text: Gibbons checks his watch. They get up and start walking.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - SUNSET
text: The phalanx of Agents surrounds Xander and Gibbons as they
text: walk to the gate. The Nerdy Agent hurries to catch up.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Uh... Call signs derive from the
dialog: parameters of the mission.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: If he doesn't like it, we can make
dialog: an exception just this once. We'll
dialog: call him "Triple X".
text: They walk past the gate, down the jet-way, the Agents FLASH
text: BADGES to the GATE WORKERS.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Up yours.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
text: Crude and defiant as always, Triple
dialog: X. It fits so well because you're
dialog: obscene.
text: Xander is the last one to board the plane.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Is that all?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Just remember, I'll be watching.
text: As the door closes, he looks back at Gibbons and his phalanx
dialog: of Agents.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I've got something for you to chew
dialog: on. Next time you send someone to
dialog: save the world, make sure they like
dialog: the planet the way it is.
text: The jet's door CLOSES.
scene_heading: INT. COMMERCIAL JET - NIGHT
text: Xander is in the last row against the bulkhead. He's got a
text: personal DVD player and headphones and he's reviewing his
text: mission. The high-tech screen shows photos, maps, cool
dialog: graphics.
text: The KID sitting across the aisle leans over for a look.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What game is that?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes?
dialog: They're called "Anarchy 99", they're
dialog: the bad guy bosses.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Do they have any special powers? The
dialog: bosses always have special powers.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You wanna check it out? Come here.
text: The kid moves to the seat next to Xander.
text: Onscreen see photos of the FIVE BAD GUYS from the opening
text: sequence. We DIVE IN to the computer as Xander describes
dialog: them.
text: For each of the baddies, we'll see 3-D PHOTOS and VIDEO CLIPS,
text: all enhanced with COMPUTER GRAPHICS and POP-UP MENUS.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: First we've got Anders, the psycho
dialog: looking biker. In charge of
dialog: transportation and smuggling. Controls
dialog: every trucking union in Eastern
dialog: Europe. Don't look too clean, either.
text: We see ANDERS, the wild-eyed and unclean Swedish biker,
text: against a backdrop of MOTORCYCLES and MUSCLE CARS.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Next we got a Siberian redneck,
text: Viktor. Into snowmobiles and
dialog: snowboarding. So naturally, he covers
dialog: prostitution and the drug trade.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Naturally.
text: We see Viktor, with the goatee and belly, doing some hairy
dialog: snowboarding.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
speaker_heading: XANDER
text: Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a
dialog: bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed
dialog: kills in Chechnya, they called him
text: the "Finger of God". Assassination
dialog: and weapons.
text: We see Kirill in UNIFORM with his well used SNIPER RIFLE.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Who's the hottie?
text: He indicates Petra, the tough gangster chick. With her LEATHER
text: and TATTOOS she looks like she could mop up the floor with
dialog: Lara Croft.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You like her, huh? Petra. She runs
dialog: their finances, money laundering,
dialog: computers. Joined the gang after
dialog: spending some time as the girlfriend
dialog: of this dude, Yorgi Azar Zimin. Capo
dialog: of Anarchy 99.
text: Finally we see YORGI, the unlikely looking Mafiya Don. We
text: see CRIME SCENE PHOTOS that illustrate his exploits.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Yorgi masterminded the take-over of
dialog: three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called
dialog: it "blood week". He combined all of
dialog: their global enterprises into one
dialog: huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (skeptically)
dialog: "Anarchy" 99"?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What are you gonna do? They're Euro-
dialog: trash.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What weapons do you have?
text: Xander clicks on "INVENTORY". He scrolls through a staggering
text: array of WEAPONS and VEHICLES.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Just about anything I want, it looks
dialog: like. This is gonna be tough, though.
dialog: There's no way to save this game. I
dialog: gotta get it right the first time
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What do you get if you finish?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Nothing, really. My guy is just doing
dialog: it to stay alive.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Oh. I bet by the end he gets something
dialog: out of it.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: He gets to be the hero.
text: The Kid's mom calls him back to his seat. Xander looks at
text: the kid, then gets back to his research.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PRAGUE - DAY
text: We CRANE UP from the COBBLESTONE STREET as a BEAT-UP CAR
text: races by. We rise up, revealing PRAGUE in all it's glory.
scene_heading: INT. BEAT-UP CAR - MOVING
text: Xander sits in the back, wedged between TWO IDENTICAL LOOKING
dialog: TOUGH GUYS. If you were to call Central Casting and ask for
dialog: a couple of cold war spy types, this is what they'd send.
text: They're both 6' 4", have sloppily cut hair, square jaws,
text: wrinkled overcoats.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: This is bullshit, man, I wanna see
dialog: some ID.
text: The two tough guys flash their COP ID's. Xander studies them.
scene_heading: "IVAN PEDGRAG" and "IVAN PODROV".
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You're both named Ivan? That's gotta
dialog: be confusing on Valentine's Day. So
dialog: where we headed? Fellas, I said where
dialog: we headed?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah, whatever.
text: He looks out the window, sees a GRAND HOTEL. They drive right
dialog: on by.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRTY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: It's a crumbling old dump in a nasty part of town. Xander
text: shakes his head.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: James Bond never had to put up with
dialog: this shit.
text: Ivan 1 pulls Xander's gear bag from the trunk and throws it
text: on the sidewalk.
text: Xander picks it up and carries it into the building.
scene_heading: INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY
text: Dumpy furniture, roaches, cracked windows. Xander is ushered
text: in. There's another GUY in a UGLY SUIT waiting. He is
scene_heading: DETECTIVE MILAN SLOVO.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Sit down.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I've been on a plane for twelve hours,
dialog: I think I'll stand.
text: Ivan 1 shoves him into a chair.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: My name is Slovo, Czech secret police.
dialog: When you are here you are under my
dialog: jurisdiction, you take my orders,
dialog: you do what I say. If you become any
dialog: kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Here we go again.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: You're here because your government
dialog: is putting pressure on my government.
dialog: This is an internal affair, a Czech
dialog: affair, that you are interfering
dialog: with. I will warn you once: Don't
dialog: shit in my lawn. Get whatever
dialog: information your government seeks
dialog: and get our.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: First of all, you should kill whoever
dialog: sold you that suit. Two, I don't
dialog: wanna be here either, so just step
dialog: off. Three, if you had the authority
dialog: to shoot me you would've done it by
dialog: now, so just ease up on the machismo,
dialog: bitch. Now that we've got that sorted
dialog: out, I'm gonna get some rest.
text: Xander lays down on the bed. Slovo stares, burning with
text: hatred. He heads to the door.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Be ready in three hours.
text: Slovo exits. Ivans 1 &amp; 2 stay, staring at Xander.
scene_heading: EXT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT
text: A fancy, flashy disco with an extreme sports theme. A big
text: bouncer in a leather coat works the door. This is a highclass,
text: expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous.
text: Xander and Slovo walk up to the place. Xander's wearing a
text: Tshirt that says "RON JEREMY: AMERICAN LEGEND" complete with
text: a photo of the Hedgehog.
scene_heading: INT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT
text: A STRIPPER that looks like a runway model SLIDES across the
text: stage on SKATEBOARD KNEE-PADS while PATRONS cheer. The disco
scene_heading: is a combination STRIP-CLUB and CONCERT VENUE. All the
scene_heading: STRIPPERS are outfitted in HELMETS, ELBOW PADS, G-STRINGS
text: and BELLY SHIRTS.
text: There's a WARPED TOUR BAND playing on a STAGE. On either
text: side of the stage are two MINI-HALF PIPES that the GIRLS are
text: cutting back and forth on.
text: WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN sit in plush booths getting table dances
text: while the dance floor is packed with sexily dressed YOUNG
speaker_heading: HIPSTERS.
text: Xander gets a beer from a BUXOM COCKTAIL WAITRESS on IN-LINE
dialog: SKATES.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Nice hops.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: The corner. Anarchy 99.
text: Slovo points them out in the far corner. They're surrounded
text: by straight faced BODYGUARDS.
text: What ANARCHY 99 is doing in their booth with the STRIPPERS
dialog: looks like Led Zeppelin on tour. Booze, broads, good times...
dialog: These guys are living like rock stars.
dialog: They're all here: Anders the biker, Viktor, Kirill. In the
text: middle sit Yorgi and Petra. Petra's wearing an "I AM EVIL"
dialog: Tshirt.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: See the one with the funny colored
dialog: hair? Crazy bitch stabbed one of my
text: men in the knee-cap. There they are,
dialog: American. The low-rent millionaire
dialog: criminals. And you thought only your
dialog: country had white trash. American?
text: He looks around but Xander is gone. He heads for the exit,
text: pushing his way through the crowd. But then he spots him,
text: not by the door but deeper in the club.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Oh no!
text: He sees Xander walk right up to the Anarchy 99 booth and
text: start talking to them.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: Slovo can't hear a thing, but they're obviously interested
text: in what he has to say. Next thing he knows Xander is pointing
text: at him and waving him over.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: What the hell...?
text: Slovo makes his way through the crowd to the booth. Yorgi
text: looks him up and down.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: That's the guy.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: This pizda? Never seen him before.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (to Slovo)
dialog: Who you workin' for? What do you do
dialog: for a living, dickhead?
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Uh... I am... I work in insurance.
text: Xander grabs Slovo and starts searching him.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: (panicked whisper)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
text: He slams Slovo up against the wall and pulls out Slovo's
dialog: police badge.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Look what we have here. Czech 5-0 on
dialog: the mack.
text: The Bodyguards pull out guns and Slovo rushes for the
text: emergency exit in a panic. In seconds he's out and gone.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Cops. Like a plague. No matter how
dialog: many you pay there's always another
dialog: with his hand out. How did you pick
dialog: him out?
speaker_heading: XANDER
text: He flashed his badge to half the bar
dialog: when he bought his drink.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: I appreciate you bringing this to
dialog: our attention. Whatever you want,
dialog: the rest of the night, consider it
text: on the house.
text: Yorgi waves over some strippers.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Thanks, but I'm here on business. I
dialog: heard you're the G around here. I'm
dialog: looking for some cars, expensive
dialog: ones. A lot of them.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Sorry, man, don't know what you're
dialog: talking about.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'm talking about the sports cars
text: that disappear off the docks in Genoa
dialog: and wind up here. If you don't know
dialog: about 'em, who does?
text: Yorgi nods and the Bodyguards step in front of Xander.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I guess I heard wrong.
text: Xander turns to leave.
text: That's when Anders notices the "X" tattoo on the back of
text: Xander's head. He gets excited and alerts Yorgi.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Xander Cage!
text: Xander turns. Suddenly their whole demeanor changes. All
text: five guys get up, awed, and push the Bodyguards out of the
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: ANDERS
dialog: The X man! We seen your bootleg
dialog: videos!
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You sick! You sick crazy on a board,
dialog: on a bike! Everything!
speaker_heading: YORGI
text: This is insane, man. Xander Cage in
dialog: Prague. Come on, sit. Sit with us.
text: Yorgi signals for more drinks.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: I remember that one where you jump
text: the motorcycle over the freeway at
dialog: rush hour.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: When else are you gonna do it?
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: You almost died on that one.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Cops arrested me while I was still
dialog: in surgery. Did two months.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: We seen all your shit! So you want
dialog: cars? We get whatever cars you need.
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: XANDER
text: Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end
text: pasta rockets. Ten to start.
speaker_heading: ANDERS
dialog: Ten! No problem! We do that no
dialog: problem!
text: Petra elbows Anders.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're
dialog: talking a lousy million five U.S.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I have Japanese buyers who are looking
dialog: to move a fleet, if you have the
dialog: quality of merchandise they're after.
dialog: And it's a mil two, max.
text: Petra glances at Yorgi who nods.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Do you know what a wire transfer is?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Is she for real? Honey, maybe you
dialog: should quiet down and let the grownups
dialog: have a conversation.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: My goodness, a word with four
dialog: syllables. I should get some ice
dialog: before your brain gets too hot.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: (smiles)
text: So cute. He shows up for a battle of
text: wits with a mental butter knife.
text: Xander looks to Yorgi.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Don't look at me, X, she handles all
dialog: the details.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: It'll work faster if I have an account
dialog: number.
text: Petra scrawls numbers on a cocktail napkin.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: You'll have forty-eight hours to
dialog: complete the transfer. Don't waste
dialog: our time.
text: Xander snatches the napkin.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Wouldn't dream of it. I'm even gonna
dialog: throw in a few extra bucks to send
dialog: you to charm school.
text: Petra glares at him.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Alright, now that business is
dialog: finished, we party! Bitches, come!
dialog: We have a drink and toast the deal!
text: Yorgi claps and a flock of strippers descends on the booth.
text: Anarchy 99 lifts their glasses. Xander joins in the toast.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I believe I can hang with you fellas
dialog: for a while.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MORNING
text: We see the FEET of AGENT POLK sprinting down the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - MORNING
text: Agent Polk looks around, spots Gibbons. He rushes to him,
text: waving a COMMUNIQUÉ.
text: Gibbons grabs the communiqué, reads it. He looks up, stunned.
scene_heading: INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY
text: Xander is having coffee at his window when his communicator
speaker_heading: RINGS.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I guess you got my E-mail. I set up
text: a purchase. Ten cars.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN INFORMATION ROOM
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: If you're trying to push my buttons,
dialog: you're on the right track. Don't
dialog: make me question my own judgment, X.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Buddy, you sent me here to get close
dialog: to their organization, that costs
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: One point two million dollars? I did
dialog: not authorize you to spend one point
dialog: two million dollars!
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'm already on a first name basis
dialog: with these dudes, I got a deal set
dialog: up, you want me to hammer it or not?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: We're not after car thieves here.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What the hell am I after? You're
dialog: telling me dick.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: That information is classified. You're
dialog: there to gather information on their
dialog: operations, period.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Call me crazy, but I thought hooking
dialog: up a million dollar deal was a great
dialog: way to get on their good side. What
dialog: else? You gonna hassle me about the
dialog: weapons and spy stuff too?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: My friend, if you're planning on
dialog: crossing me...
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I know, poison needles in my shins.
dialog: You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
text: Xander hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Gibbons stands before Sam's desk. Sam scans over the
dialog: communiqué.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry
dialog: Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: I think we should send him whatever
dialog: he wants.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: You what? A wire transfer of this
dialog: size?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: If it means getting Silent Night
dialog: back, absolutely.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: You're talking about a very expensive
dialog: risk here.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: He's gotten closer in 24 hours than
text: all of the other operatives combined.
dialog: He got us an account number to boot.
dialog: Now even if he's just dumb and lucky,
dialog: I say we back his play.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I put him out there, Sam. If he
dialog: doesn't come up with the money,
dialog: they'll kill him. I can't let that
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: Why not? You were going to throw him
dialog: in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
text: Gibbons smiles.
speaker_heading: SAM TANNICK
dialog: Alright, do what you want. But keep
text: the screws on him. He's a wild card.
dialog: That could be either good or bad.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I
dialog: can deal with that.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY
text: A HELICOPTER comes flying in, a MAN standing out on the strut.
text: He's a disgruntled GADGET WRANGLER from the NSA. His name is
text: TOBY LEE SHAVERS.
text: Slovo and Xander watch from a distance as a series of METAL
text: CASES is unloaded by CZECH COPS. Slovo lets out a low whistle.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Your government must know something
dialog: we don't.
text: Shavers walks up to them.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle-
dialog: trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent
dialog: Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking
dialog: for what's his name. Three X' s.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: That's would be me.
text: Shavers gives him a disapproving look.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: Figures. You got someplace we can
dialog: spread out my gear or what? I mean
dialog: today.
text: Slovo gestures towards the stairs and Shavers marches off,
text: muttering to himself.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: I'll leave you two alone to talk.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Yeah, thanks a lot.
scene_heading: INT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - BASEMENT TRAINING AREA - DAY
text: Down in the basement there is a SHOOTING RANGE along one
text: wall. A squad of CZECH COPS is BLASTING AWAY. They become
text: distracted by the noise in the middle of the room.
text: One of the metal boxes has been dropped by a Cop. The rest
text: are spread out in front of Xander, Slovo and Shavers.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: Back off, just go away you klutz.
dialog: Alright, here's the story. The items
dialog: in these cases belong to me. I
dialog: designed them, built them, and was
dialog: going to use them in the field myself
dialog: until you showed up.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I stole your beat, huh? Guess you
dialog: forgot to brown-nose the right people.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: Is that supposed to be funny? I'm
dialog: not laughing. I've worked for ten
dialog: years to get my shot at being a field
dialog: agent, funny boy. And ar the last
dialog: minute I get bumped by you, some
dialog: reject from the Ozzfest.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Why don't you show me some gear before
dialog: you get hurt.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: Listen to you. Right away, sir,
dialog: anything you say, sir.
text: Shavers pops open the first metal case. Inside are various
text: GADGETS laid into the molded carbon fiber lining.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What is all this? I didn't even order
dialog: some of this stuff.
text: Shavers holds up a small METAL BALL.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: You're gonna need it, rookie, trust
dialog: me.
text: The metal ball unrolls into a six legged ROBOT INSECT.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
text: An all-terrain mobile video monitoring
dialog: system for surveillance. I call it
dialog: the "Roach Cam". See the little camera
dialog: it's got for a head?
text: Xander picks it up.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Kinda looks like you.
text: Shavers snatches it back. He puts on a METAL GLOVE, it's
text: fingers are SHARP TALONS.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
text: "Terminator" climbing claws.
text: He CLAMPS the claw onto the metal case. It holds fast.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
text: Miniature power cams set in on
dialog: contact, giving you a sure grip on
dialog: any surface.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: They come in any other styles or
dialog: colors?
text: He tosses the glove aside, pulls out a DART GUN.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: This is your standard dart gun.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: That one I'm real familiar with.
text: Shavers displays a case of DARTS.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: You've got your chromium knock-out
dialog: dart, microphone listening dart,
dialog: explosive dart, even one with a
dialog: splatter blood packet, whatever you
dialog: need. They also come in a special
dialog: 9mm casing for use with your service
dialog: pistol.
text: Xander pulls out some SUPER BINOCULARS.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
text: Multi-view binoculars. Nine different
dialog: enhanced vision modes, plus a digital
dialog: camera.
text: Xander looks through them, starts cycling through the
dialog: different modes.
text: BINOCULAR P.O.V. - we see the various modes as Xander scans
dialog: the grounds.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: Infrared, starlight... Even a special
dialog: "penetrator" mode to see through
dialog: walls, curtains, almost anything...
text: Xander aims at the shooting range.
text: BINOCULAR P.O.V. - we see through the clothes of the FEMALE
dialog: COPS on the shooting range. (PG-13 style, of course). We can
text: even see the INNER WORKINGS of their GUNS. One of the Female
text: Cops turns and gives Xander an approving look.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I think I'll hang on to these.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: Think again, that's government
dialog: property. You have to sign for
dialog: everything. I've got one more that
dialog: wasn't on your list.
text: Shavers pulls out a JUMPSUIT.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: From the Beastie Boys collection?
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: It's a stakeout suit. It's got food,
dialog: water, recording gear, anything you
dialog: need for covert spying. It's all-
dialog: weather, fire retardant, and if you
dialog: give this buckle a sharp pull, the
text: whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You're joking, right?
text: Shavers just gives him a deadpan look.
speaker_heading: SHAVERS
dialog: Now that I've given you the overview,
dialog: we're going to spend the next couple
dialog: hours going into extensive operational
dialog: detail.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I thought that was in detail.
text: As Shavers drones on, Xander hangs his head.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DAY
text: The TEN BLACK MARKET EUROPEAN SPORTS CARS are loaded on two
text: TRANSPORT TRUCKS. Mafiya BODYGUARDS keep watch.
text: The Ivans (in Teamster garb) inspect the cars while Xander
text: supervises. Anders hovers around him.
speaker_heading: ANDERS
dialog: So what you think? Beautiful!
text: Sitting in an OFFICE watching are Yorgi, Kirill and Petra.
text: Petra has a LAPTOP.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Has it arrived yet?
text: Petra checks her computer. ON SCREEN she's monitoring their
scene_heading: BANK ACCOUNT.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Nothing. He had two days.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
text: Outside the Ivans nod approval and Xander heads to the office.
text: Yorgi looks to kirill, who puts his hand on his PISTOL.
text: Xander opens the door.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Very nice. I'm impressed.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: I'm somewhat less so. We seem to
dialog: have a bit of a problem...
text: Just then Petra's computer BEEPS and the MONEY floods into
text: their account. Xander holds up a CELL PHONE and smiles.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I had to inspect the merchandise
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Of course.
text: He nods for Kirill to stand down.
text: OUTSIDE - the two transport trucks are driven off by the
text: Ivans. As they pull out they reveal ANOTHER CAR under a COVER.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: This is a gift. From me to you.
text: Anders pulls off the cover, revealing a cherry '72 PONTIAC
dialog: GTO.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: It's a little nothing, you take it.
text: Xander checks out his new ride. Yorgi gets in the passenger
dialog: seat.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Come on, get in.
text: Xander sits behind the wheel and STARTS IT UP. The big engine
speaker_heading: ROARS.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You're alright, Yorgi.
text: Next door to the warehouse sits an ABANDONED BUILDING. Up on
text: the sloped roof, Slovo spies down on the transaction. He's
text: got a camera with a big zoom lens.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Smile, bychara.
text: Slovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured. To get
text: a better vantage, he JUMPS DOWN onto a lower part of the
dialog: roof.
text: CRUNCH! His foot BREAKS THROUGH THE SHABBY ROOF TILE.
text: Down below, Kirill hears the noise.
speaker_heading: KIRILL
dialog: Yorgi!
text: They all look to the abandoned building.
text: Through the second floor window they can see Slovo's leg
text: poking through the ceiling.
text: Xander is taken aback.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: What in the hell...?
text: Yorgi turns to Xander, goes for his pistol.
text: Thinking fast, Xander does the same.
text: They draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each other's
text: heads as they sit in the car. Petra, Kirill and Anders draw
text: as well, all of them covering Xander.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: What's going on, my friend?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You tell me! You got a sniper up
dialog: there or what?
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: He's not with us, Xander. He must be
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (he cocks the hammer)
dialog: Bullshit! You get your boy off that
dialog: roof or I swear to God I'm gonna
dialog: give you another hole to breathe out
dialog: of.
text: Yorgi stares, finally believes him. He lowers his gun.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Get him! Find out who he is!
text: By now Slovo is down the fire escape. He hits the ground and
text: goes running down the street.
text: The Anarchy 99 crew heads for their cars. Xander SPINS the
text: cylinder on his REVOLVER.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I've got him. Buckle up.
text: The GTO peels out.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Slovo is huffing and puffing as fast as he can when Xander
text: comes skidding around the corner. He looks back and sees the
text: speeding GTO.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: That's the cop from the club!
text: Xander does the only thing he can. He puts the car sideways
text: and aims out the window as he slides to a stop.
text: Slovo turns and BLAM! Xander SHOOTS Slovo right in the chest.
text: IN SLO-MO: a spray of BLOOD erupts from his chest and Slovo
text: falls backwards, his face frozen in a look of shock and
dialog: betrayal.
text: The smoking shell clatters to the ground.
text: Slovo blinks up at Xander, gasping for words, then lays still.
text: Xander hops out, rifles through Slovo's pockets. The other
text: Anarchy 99 cars pull up, the whole group looking on.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: What are you doing? Get in the car!
text: Xander heads back to the GTO and the cars peel out.
scene_heading: INT. GTO - MOVING - DAY
text: The rest of Anarchy 99 follows behind the GTO.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: I don't believe it! You can't shoot
text: a cop in the middle of the street!
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (grim)
dialog: Had to do what I had to do.
text: He pulls out the roll of FILM. Yorgi laughs.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: You say you get a million, you get
dialog: the million. Some cop gives us shit,
dialog: he's dead. Jesus Christ, man, you're
dialog: hard-core!
scene_heading: EXT. DEAD END STREET - DAY
text: The Ivans pull up in their transport trucks. They see all
text: the blood and rush towards Slovo. But something doesn't look
dialog: right.
text: Ivan 1 TASTES the blood and spits it out.
speaker_heading: IVAN 1
dialog: It's sweet.
text: Ivan 2 pulls a CHROME DART from Slovo's chest. Slovo GROANS.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
text: It's a crowded basement rave club. Hot and sweaty RAVERS
text: dance in provocative outfits. The Anarchy 99 group is standing
text: on the best booth, right on the packed dance floor.
text: Surrounding them are a handful of MAFIYA BODYGUARDS who stand
text: at attention like the Secret Service.
text: Anders swings from a water pipe and then drops onto the table,
text: smashing glass.
text: A DRUNK GUY tries to pull Petra onto the dance floor and she
text: PUNCHES him. The Bodyguards drag the dude out for a proper
text: thrashing. Yorgi shatters a BOTTLE against the wall.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy
dialog: 99!
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What's "Anarchy 99"?
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: It's all this craziness! It's what
dialog: we've been living since 99, when we
dialog: left the Army. One of our brothers
dialog: died in Grozny and we said the hell
dialog: with this shit. What for? He dies
dialog: for what? Politics? Who's politics?
dialog: Not ours.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You wanna see my politics?
text: Xander shows him a TATTOO on his arm. It shows PLANET EARTH
text: with a giant SCREW through it.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Screw the world. If I'm gonna die
dialog: for something, it better be bitches
dialog: and money.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: That's what I'm talking about, man!
dialog: That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
text: Yorgi rolls up his sleeve, revealing an Anarchy 99 tat (a
text: circled "A" with "99" underneath).
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: To us it means no walls, no speed
dialog: limits, no jails. It's everybody
dialog: does what he wants. People think
dialog: democracy is freedom but they don't
dialog: have a clue. There's an old punk
dialog: song. It says: "America stands for
dialog: freedom, but if you think you're
dialog: free..."
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: "...try walking into a deli and
dialog: urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy
dialog: Burger' by the Vandals.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: You got it, man. It's stupid but
dialog: it's true. True freedom is when you
dialog: do whatever you want anytime you
dialog: want. That's when you know you're
dialog: living, man.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: How you gonna do that with government
dialog: and rules everywhere?
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Easy. You get enough money that you
dialog: grow an ass big enough for the whole
dialog: world to kiss.
text: Yorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor. The
text: Xed out ravers swat it around like confetti.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: You hang with us, buddy, taste some
dialog: freedom! Petra! Dance with this guy!
text: Yorgi melts into the dance floor crowd, leaving Xander alone
text: with Petra. She gets up grumpily and starts dancing. Xander
text: joins her, but she won't even look at him.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: This is great, dancing with the back
dialog: of your head.
text: She reluctantly turns around.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: If you got a problem with me, why
dialog: are we dancing?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Yorgi asked me to.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You do everything Yorgi says?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Go to hell.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: It's gonna be like that, huh? You
dialog: got all bent out of shape as soon as
text: he started dancing with someone else.
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Mind your business.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Did you guys used to date? That's
dialog: it, right? He broke your heart and
dialog: you're still soft on him. That's
dialog: funny, it don't seem to fit with a
dialog: tough broad like you.
text: She glares at him and walks away. Xander follows.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Why are you still hanging around?
dialog: Your business is finished, you should
dialog: go home.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I was invited. What's your story?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: I don't know who you are or where
dialog: you come from, but I don't like you.
dialog: You ask too many questions.
text: There's a big line outside the "ladies" and no line at the
text: "men's". Petra heads into the Men's Room.
text: Some DUDE whistles at her. She pushes him out of the way and
text: enters a stall. Xander leans on the sink.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Come on, don't front like that. You'll
dialog: put a guy right off you.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Don't even bother, X man, I'm not
dialog: your type.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: That right? Why's that?
text: The stall door flies open and Petra marches out.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: My chest is too small and my brain
dialog: is too big.
text: She shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall.
text: Xander walks back out, shaking his head and laughing.
text: Across the room, Viktor shoves the D.J. out of the way and
text: puts on "ANARCHY BURGER" by the Vandals. The rave dance is
text: interrupted by the pounding punk beat.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Xander, check it out! The revolution
dialog: begins!
text: Viktor and Anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent
text: mosh pit. Xander can't help it, he actually likes these guys.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Let's get some air, man.
text: Yorgi and Xander head outside. A moment later, Kirill hurries
text: out another door.
scene_heading: EXT. PRAGUE RIVERFRONT - NIGHT
text: It's late. Yorgi and Xander stroll along the river.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You got a great set-up here Yorgi.
dialog: You really know how to live.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's
dialog: been good to me.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I've been here before, when I was a
dialog: kid. My old man was in the service,
dialog: we used to live on the Army base in
dialog: Hamburg.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: You, an Army brat? I don't see that
dialog: one at all. Did you join the service
dialog: as well?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Hell no. My dad was a straight up
dialog: tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this
dialog: general off and got himself
text: dishonorably discharged. Had a court
dialog: martial and everything. The charges
dialog: were total bullshit, so he was sure
dialog: he'd get his name cleared, but it
dialog: didn't happen.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Connections and politics, it's the
dialog: same everywhere.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: My old man, he bought into the system,
dialog: and it screwed him. So he swallowed
dialog: a bullet. Me, I don't believe in
dialog: nothing I can't see and touch.
text: The camera suddenly ZOOMS across the city, flying over streets
text: and houses until, half a mile away, it finds Kirill in a
text: window with his SNIPER RIFLE.
text: P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is in the crosshairs.
text: The scope pans over to Yorgi, who looks INTO CAMERA and gives
text: a small signal, calling off the hit.
scene_heading: BACK ON YORGI AND XANDER
text: Yorgi looks up at a "PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE" banner.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Next week these idiots are having a
dialog: peace conference here. What the hell
dialog: are they going to talk about? It's
dialog: the system itself that causes all
dialog: the world's problems. You're okay,
dialog: buddy. Come on, it's getting early.
text: They stroll off and Kirill stands down.
scene_heading: EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - SUNRISE
text: A flotilla of VEHICLES (Xander's GTO among them) drives
text: through the gate in a massive, stone wall. It's a big manor
text: house in the middle of town.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - PRAGUE - SUNRISE
text: The GTO, sedans, SUV's park in the courtyard. Xander sees a
text: row of MOTORCYCLES parked here as well.
text: Xander also sees a Guard hit a switch that LOWERS the HEAVY
scene_heading: WOODEN GATE.
text: Yorgi corrals a bunch of STRIPPERS he's brought home.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: This way, girls, let's go!
text: He leads the whole troop inside.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - SUNRISE
text: As they go down the hall/Xander sees ROOMS FULL OF OFFICE
text: WORKERS and MAFIYA GOONS.
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Diversified global operations. The
dialog: sun never sets on our empire.
text: Xander takes in WORLD MAPS, FAX MACHINES, BANKS OF COMPUTERS.
dialog: For all their screwing around, it's clear Anarchy 99 runs a
dialog: large operation.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - SUNRISE
text: With leaded glass windows overlooking the river, this place
text: is beautiful. Inside it's done up more like the house from
text: MTV's "Real World", except trashed. There's cool fish tanks,
text: a pool table, PS2 on a flatscreen and spray paint and holes
text: all over the walls.
text: SERVANTS welcome them with food and Yorgi's SECRETARY gives
dialog: him important messages.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: (sorting through
dialog: messages)
dialog: Not bad, yes? The original owners,
dialog: they just one day decide to move
dialog: out.
text: Anders starts pounding on a drumset. Petra kicks a soccer
text: ball at him.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Yeb vas, z'opa. Shut up!
text: Yorgi paws at a Stripper.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: I've got meetings this afternoon,
dialog: I've got to get some sleep. Just
dialog: pick a girl.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: You want to insult me? This is my
dialog: hospitality. Pick one.
text: Xander points at one of the Strippers. She's wearing a
text: fashionable FLAK JACKET.
speaker_heading: YORGI
text: Good, now find a room to crash in.
dialog: Petra, show him.
text: The surly Petra opens a door, revealing a hall of doors.
text: Xander and Flak Jacket follow.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You gonna tuck us in?
text: She just gives him a nasty look, walks into her room and
text: slams the door. Xander scratches his head and picks a room.
text: The others shuffle off to their beds with their Strippers.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - XANDER'S ROOM - SUNRISE
text: Flak Jacket is out of sight in the bathroom. Xander talks to
text: her while he gets undressed.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Listen, no offense, but I'm not in
dialog: the market right now, okay? You can
dialog: stay here, but let's not --
text: He trails off as she steps out of the bathroom. She's wearing
text: just a G-string and the flak jacket.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You don't understand a word I'm
dialog: saying, do you?
text: She just smiles at him sweetly and pulls his shirt off. She
text: looks at the ENGAGEMENT RING still pierced through his nipple
text: and gives a puzzled look.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Stupid, right? That's what I was
dialog: trying to tell you. I just got out
dialog: of this heavy thing...
text: She kisses him and lets the flak jacket fall (PG-13 style).
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: The things I have to do for my
dialog: country.
text: He gives in and starts making out with her.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - LATER THAT MORNING
text: Xander sneaks out of his room and down the hail. Behind him,
text: we can see Flak Jacket asleep amongst the tussled sheets.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - MAIN HALL - MORNING
text: Anders is snoring on the floor. Xander skirrs around him and
text: goes through another door.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY
text: Xander finds an office and starts going through the desk. He
text: finds a PALM PILOT and snaps a RECORDING DEVICE to the bottom.
text: In seconds he's copied everything on it. He moves on to some
dialog: drawers.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: What are you doing?
text: He turns, sees Petra standing in the doorway with a GUN.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Looking for a phone book. I want to
dialog: call a cab. Unless you wanna give me
dialog: a ride?
text: She shuts the door, advances, staring him down.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: We hung out last night, remember?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: I also remember you drove your car
dialog: here. Who are you really? Make no
dialog: mistake, I will shoot you and not
dialog: feel bad about it. Who are you working
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude
text: trying to make a buck.
text: She SLAPS him, hard.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Bullshit. I see you look at
dialog: everything, study everything, ask
dialog: questions. I know exactly what you're
dialog: doing. Empty your pockets.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You've got to relax, baby, you're
dialog: paranoid.
text: She SLAPS him again and Xander goes for her gun. Before he
text: can pry it from her hand, she's pulled another gun from
text: nowhere and has it jammed against his neck. He lets go.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Hey, you're good.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Maybe we should start again, yes? I
dialog: know so little about you, except
dialog: that you're not what you say you
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: That makes two of us then, sweetheart,
dialog: because I ain't buying your bullshit
dialog: either. You're not like them, I can
dialog: see it in your eyes. So you tell me,
dialog: who's bullshitting who?
scene_heading: INT. YORGI'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: There are THREE STRIPPERS asleep in bed. Yorgi is sitting at
text: his COMPUTER in his underwear.
text: He's hacked in to the CZECH POLICE network.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Something bothers me about you, Mr.
dialog: Xander Cage...
text: He looks around a bit, doesn't find what he's looking for.
text: He sits up, getting pissed.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Get Kirill. Now!
text: She heads out. Yorgi goes to the bathroom, splashes water on
text: his face.
text: Kirill enters, still half asleep.
speaker_heading: KIRILL
dialog: What's the problem?
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: I'm inside the police mainframe. Do
dialog: you see anything?
text: Kirill studies the screen while Yorgi pulls on clothes.
speaker_heading: KIRILL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: I've searched their E-mail. No funeral
dialog: announcement, no obituary, no call-
text: to-arms. Nothing on the news, even.
dialog: I swear I saw a cop get shot
dialog: yesterday. How come no one is talking
dialog: about it?
text: Kirill looks back at the screen. Nothing there.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: I also check the wire transfer. I
dialog: follow the money back to it's source,
dialog: but there is no source. It comes
dialog: from nowhere. First they bring CIA,
dialog: then British SAS, now maybe they
text: plumb the lower depths. Maybe now
dialog: they send someone who looks like us.
dialog: Maybe someone like our houseguest
dialog: Mr. X.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - OFFICE - DAY
text: Petra still has the gun on Xander.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: The eyes don't lie. All this has
dialog: gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You
dialog: came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and
dialog: you stayed because it was fun. Now
dialog: you don't like it so much, but you're
dialog: in so deep you can't get out anymore.
dialog: Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Go to hell!
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Look at you. You're helping run things
dialog: now. You're a gangster. I bet that
dialog: snuck up on you. You woke up one day
dialog: and you were a criminal.
text: She pulls back the hammer on her gun.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: It's cool, I feel you. I might even
dialog: be able to help. Here, let me show
dialog: you something. You wanna see what's
dialog: in my pocket, I'll show you.
text: He makes a move and she jabs the gun at him. She reaches
text: into the pocket for him and pulls out his little data
dialog: recorder.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: What are you?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'm an information gatherer. You
dialog: wanna go somewhere and talk about
dialog: it?
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Yorgi creeps down the hall, Kirill in tow. They both screw
text: SILENCERS onto their PISTOLS.
text: They flatten themselves up against the wall and prepare to
text: burst into Xander's room.
dialog: One...
dialog: Two...
text: THREE! They kick in the door and aim their guns around.
text: Flak Jacket sits up, terrified.
text: Yorgi and Kirill lower their guns. Viktor stumbles by in his
dialog: underwear.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: They went to breakfast.
scene_heading: INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY
text: This is a beautiful and historic Prague location with WINDOWS
text: and a nice view. It's rather fancy and PACKED with UPSCALE
text: PATRONS. Petra and Xander sit in the middle of the room,
text: sticking out badly in their grungy clothes.
text: A WAITER takes their order.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Perogies, potato pancakes, fried
text: goose livers, the sausage plate and
text: a pot of Turkish coffee.
text: Xander shakes his head.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'm just gonna have a garden salad.
text: Oil and balsamic vinegar on the side.
text: The Waiter takes off. Petra puffs on a cigarette, staring at
dialog: Xander.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: That's how you eat? It's like a
dialog: gerbil.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I'm from L.A.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: So why don't you tell me something
dialog: about who you gather information
dialog: for. They obviously have very deep
dialog: pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Let's just say I'm freelancing and
dialog: leave it at that.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Whoever sent you knew what they were
dialog: doing. You and Yorgi are practically
text: twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims
dialog: who make a lot of noise but don't
dialog: say much.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Don't judge a comic book by it's
dialog: cover.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: You agree with a lot of what he says,
dialog: don't you.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I know where he's coming from. The
dialog: only thing I really don't get is why
dialog: he dumped you. Up until I found that
dialog: out, I thought his judgment was pretty
dialog: sound.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Don't even start. I'll be honest, I
dialog: don't trust you. Bur lets pretend
dialog: for a minute that what you say is
dialog: true, that I want to leave. What can
dialog: you do about it?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: The people I know want facts, the
dialog: kinds of things an insider would
dialog: know. They're interested in putting
dialog: Anarchy 99 out of business.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: All I have to do is risk my life
dialog: providing you with these facts.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: We could work together. Then maybe
dialog: we could both get the hell out of
dialog: here. There's a beach in Bora Bora
dialog: with my name on it.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: A beach named X? That I'd like to
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: So there you have it. I guess you
dialog: just have to ask yourself, how bad
dialog: to you want out?
text: She thinks on it. Then her cell phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Da!
speaker_heading: KIRILL (O.S.)
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Listen very carefully, Petra. We
dialog: think Cage may be an American agent,
dialog: do you understand what I'm telling
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: KIRILL (O.S.)
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Don't worry, I've got your back. I'm
text: right across the street, above the
dialog: bakery. Just bring him outside and
dialog: let me do the rest.
text: Kirill hangs up. She looks back at Xander, shell shocked.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What's up? Is there a problem?
text: She studies his eyes, decides to risk it.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: They tell me you're an American agent.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: There's no more time for games. They
dialog: made you. There's a sniper out front
dialog: waiting to put a bullet in your eye.
dialog: Tell me if it's true.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: It's a long story, but yeah, more or
dialog: less.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Jesus Christ. You're going to have
text: to go out the back. The data that
dialog: you copied with your toy. Tomorrow,
dialog: at six o'clock. Look it up. We're
dialog: taking a trip. Be there at six and
dialog: you'll have plenty to tell your
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: If I go out the back, he'll know
dialog: you've warned me.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: That's alright, I'll figure something
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Not an option. Just get up slowly
dialog: like everything's cool. Petra, trust
dialog: me. You just hung yourself out to
dialog: dry for me, I'm not gonna let you
dialog: down.
scene_heading: EXT. BAKERY ROOF - DAY
text: Kirill lays on his stomach, peering into the scope of his
scene_heading: SILENCED SNIPER RIFLE.
text: P.O.V. Through scope - he can faintly see them inside the
text: crowded restaurant. Xander and Petra are making their way
text: towards the exit.
speaker_heading: KIRILL
dialog: Nice and easy, Petra...
scene_heading: INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY
text: They work their way through the lunchtime crowd.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: I can't let this happen. I want you
dialog: to go out the back. I'll make up
dialog: some excuse.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: They'll kill you, you know they will.
dialog: Besides, there is no back door. Keep
dialog: smiling. Ready? Now.
scene_heading: EXT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Xander's timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the
text: door, a BUS passes by.
text: Kirill keeps focused, waiting for the bus to pass.
text: P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is sporadically visible
text: through the bus windows.
text: Kirill's finger tightens on the trigger...
text: As soon as the bus passes he FIRES!
text: But Xander's not there, he's ducked down to tie his shoe.
text: CRASH! The glass door behind him shatters. Feigning surprise,
text: Xander PUNCHES PETRA IN THE FACE and sprints down the block.
text: He runs bent low, the parked cars protecting him from the
text: sniper. Kirill fires anyway, taking out car windows.
text: At the end of the block is a long staircase with a METAL
text: RAIL down the middle.
text: As he runs by an outdoor restaurant Xander snatches the
text: SERVING TRAY from a startled WAITER, sending food and drink
dialog: flying.
text: He hops on the serving tray like it's a skateboard and does
text: a RAIL-SLIDE down the length of the stairs. He's moving too
dialog: fast for Kirill.
text: He jumps off at the bottom and the tray POPS UP INTO THE
speaker_heading: AIR.
text: Kirill BLASTS it like a clay pigeon.
text: By now Xander is out of sight. Kirill pounds his rifle in
dialog: frustration.
text: Petra gets to the top of the stairs. She gives Kirill a "Where
text: did he go?" look. Her nose is bloody, helping to sell her
dialog: performance.
text: Then she turns and looks off after Xander. She sees his GTO
text: speeding away.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NORWEGIAN FJORDS - LATE AFTERNOON
text: We're looking down at a SHIP moving through the fjord, seen
text: from high above. It's towing a SMALLER BOAT behind it. An
dialog: airplane? No, we're at the top of the Trollveggen, Norway's
text: legendary "Troll Wall". It's a near 5,000 foot sheer drop to
dialog: the ocean.
text: Six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff. They wear
text: webbed "squirrel" jumpsuits, helmets and parachutes. On each
text: thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced
text: MP-5 sub-machine guns. Together they stare down at the ship.
text: Petra is among them. She looks down at her watch. It is
text: precisely 5:59PM. She glances around. The top of the cliff
text: is rocky and flat. Xander is nowhere to be seen.
text: FIFTY YARDS AWAY - we see Xander sneaking forward military
text: style. He's got his "stakeout suit" on and is keeping low.
text: HE CHECKS HIS WATCH: "6 PM"
text: The members of Anarchy 99 put on their goggles and, without
text: saying a word, they leap off the Troll Wall.
text: Xander runs to the edge and looks down. He sees the group
text: freefailing down the sheer cliff face.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Very nice.
text: The six plummet away from him at incredible speed. In a hard
text: arch, they peak at 120 m.p.h.
text: Then, using the webbed wings under their arms and between
text: their legs, they go into aerodynamic "track" positions and
text: rocket away from the wall.
text: Like dark angels, they soar out over the water in formation.
text: ON THE SHIP BELOW --
text: The ship below is a scientific research vessel. On the deck,
text: a few SAILORS and SCIENTISTS watch the sun set.
text: The six dark figures close in rapidly.
text: At the last moment they pull their chutes and deftly glide
text: towards the ship.
text: A sailor looks up and spots them.
text: Before he can shout, he's SHOT IN THE LEG and goes down.
text: Seconds later, they're on the deck, tearing off their rigs.
text: They race across the deck, taking over the ship in a surgical
text: manner. They herd everyone back heading for the bridge.
text: Petra hangs back. She looks back at the cliff, up towards
dialog: Xander.
speaker_heading: XANDER'S P.O.V.
text: Through his SUPER BINOCULARS we see them storming the bridge.
text: As they head inside, they disappear from view.
text: Xander hits a button on the side of the binoculars.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Let's see what's going on inside...
scene_heading: "PENETRATOR" P.O.V.
text: Now he can see THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE SHIP.
text: He sees THE CREW, herded into a room and LOCKED IN by Anarchy
dialog: 99.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Anarchy 99 seals the door, locking the crew away. They slap
text: five and bump chests, still totally amped up.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON
text: ANGLE ON - a LARGE SUBMERSIBLE VEHICLE. It's white and twelve
text: feet long. There are MOTORS on either side and a PANEL OF
text: SOLAR CELLS on the top of a periscope-like projection rising
text: from the back.
text: This is the AHAB DEVICE. It sits in the WET WELL at the back
text: of the ship, ready to be launched out the back sea doors.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Ready the boat.
text: There is a SMALLER BOAT moored to the back of the ship.
text: Kirill and Viktor hop onto it's deck. They start to WHISTLE
text: as they work. Sounds like the "Andy Griffith" theme.
scene_heading: XANDER'S BINOCULARS P.O.V.
text: He takes DIGITAL PHOTOS of the Ahab device.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What the hell are you guys stealing?
text: BACK ON THE SHIP
text: The smaller boat is launched and ready to do. Yorgi goes to
text: the WET WELL CONTROLS and hits a switch.
text: The aft doors open, letting water into the wet well. In
text: seconds Ahab starts to float. Anders loosens it from it's
text: moorings and they TIE AHAB TO THE BACK OF THE SMALLER BOAT.
speaker_heading: KIRILL
dialog: Ready.
text: Yorgi hits another switch, opening the BALLAST DOORS on the
text: port side of the ship. Air flows out, causing the ship to
dialog: list to one side.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: It all happened so fast. Such an
dialog: unfortunate accident.
text: Yorgi MACHINE GUNS the wet well control panel.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Let's go.
text: They climb onto the boat. Petra is the last to board. She
text: looks up towards Xander and MACHINE GUNS the panel some more,
text: making sure he notices.
speaker_heading: XANDER'S P.O.V.
text: He sees the smaller boat pulling away, the Ahab device being
text: towed behind. He pans over and ZOOMS IN on the shot-up control
dialog: panel.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What the hell...?
text: He pans over to the wet well and sees it's flooding.
text: With the ballast open on only one side, the ship starts
text: LISTING. The thing is going down.
text: He pans over, clicks into "penetrator" mode, and sees the
text: Crew pounding on the walls below decks. They're trapped,
text: their WRISTS AND ANKLES BOUND WITH PLEXI-CUFFS.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF TROLL WALL - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Xander puts down the binoculars and gets up.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: No way, man, no way. I'm just supposed
dialog: to be an observer. Aw shit. This job
dialog: sucks.
text: He pats his jumpsuit, checking for the buckle.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Toby Lee Shavers, if this thing don't
dialog: work, your ass is kicked.
text: Xander steels himself, takes a few deep breaths.
text: Then he sprints to the edge and JUMPS off the cliff...
text: And that's it. He's gone. One mile, straight down.
text: Suddenly we're falling with him.
text: We hear the rush of air as he free-falls a dozen feet from
text: the craggy rock face.
text: The force of the wind ripples his cheeks.
text: He streamlines himself into a track position and jets away
text: from the cliff like Superman.
text: Before he gets too low, he RIPS THE BUCKLE.
text: Immediately his jumpsuit TEARS OFF HIS BODY in MULTIPLE
text: LAYERS, unfurling into a full sized PARASAIL.
text: Xander looks up at his parasail, relieved, and glides towards
dialog: the ship.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Petra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep Yorgi
text: from spotting it. She grabs him suddenly and KISSES him.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: What was that for?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: I'd forgotten how exciting it is
dialog: working together.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: You've been so quiet lately, Petra,
dialog: I thought you no longer cared.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Why don't we go below decks and work
dialog: off some of this adrenaline.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Viktor! Stay the course.
text: Yorgi kisses her again and heads to the cabin below.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Xander comes in for a perfect landing. He lands on the listing
text: deck and undoes his harness.
text: He sees several WOUNDED scattered on the deck.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Son of a bitch!
text: He looks across the water, sees the smaller boat far away.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Petra looks back one last time, catching sight of Xander on
text: the deck of the ship. She smiles, relieved.
text: Then she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the
dialog: price.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Xander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in.
text: With the ship listing like this, the water is pouring below
dialog: decks.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Xander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold. Here
text: is where the entire Crew has been left to drown. They are
text: struggling to stay above water, their hands and feet bound.
text: As the far end of the room is another HATCH. Water pours in
text: from this one and Xander has to get it shut.
text: He swims through the struggling Crew, spots the CAPTAIN
text: holding his YOUNG SON above water. The water is rising
text: rapidly, filling up the compartment.
text: Xander braces his feet against the bulkhead and PUSHES, but
text: the force of the water is too much.
text: He surfaces. He's got to wait until the room floods before
dialog: he can close that door.
text: He watches as the Crew goes into a panic, the water rising
text: up to the ceiling. They are gasping in the last foot of air
text: that's available. He sees the Captain's Son, crying and
text: clutching at his father.
text: Xander takes a deep breath and dives down. He grabs the hatch
text: door, braces his feet and PULLS.
text: His muscles strain as the heavy metal door slowly swings
speaker_heading: SHUT.
text: Xander surfaces and swims to the ladder. He CUTS the Captain's
text: plastic cuffs.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Is the boy alright?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Yes. I will cut the others loose,
dialog: you must run the bilge pumps!
text: The Captain takes the knife and swims to free his men.
text: Xander takes the Captain's Son and climbs up the ladder.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP'S BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Xander scans the controls but has no idea what he's looking
text: for. The Captain's Son shows him the right switch.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You sure?
text: The Son nods and Xander flips the switch. MOTORS start to
speaker_heading: HUM.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The bilge pumps spew out water furiously. Crew members come
text: up from below decks. They are soaked and grateful. They go
text: about tending to the wounded as Xander slumps down next to
text: the exhausted Captain.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Captain, huh? You get a lot of broads
dialog: with that uniform?
text: They both laugh, relieved, as the ship slowly rights itself.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - THAT NIGHT
text: Xander is in a room with the SCIENTISTS from the ship. They
text: have blueprints of the torpedo spread out. The Captain's Son
text: is wrapped in BLANKETS, shivering.
text: Xander is talking to Gibbons on his communicator.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (into communicator)
dialog: They call it "Ahab", it's a solar
dialog: powered submersible. It can
dialog: circumnavigate the globe on it's
dialog: own. They use it to track and study
dialog: the migration patterns of whales.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN THE ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM
text: Gibbons jots down the information furiously.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's
dialog: what I'm thinking. If they take out
dialog: the cameras and sensors, they could
dialog: probably put a bomb in this thing.
dialog: You drop it in the water in the Red
dialog: Sea and three weeks later it's
text: swimming up the Potomac.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: This is good work, X, damn fine work.
dialog: You need to press on at all costs,
dialog: find out what they have planned with
dialog: this "Ahab".
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Hey, one miracle at a time. They're
dialog: on to me now, remember?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: I'm gonna be en route with a team
dialog: shortly to relieve you. Just keep
dialog: the pressure on until the cavalry
dialog: arrives. And X? You done yourself
dialog: proud helping those people today.
text: Xander tussles the hair of the Captain's Son.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: You're a grungy little phoenix, you
dialog: know that? Keep up the good work.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You ain't seen nothing yet.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - DAY
text: The GTO screeches into the lot. Shavers is on his way out
text: with his SUITCASE.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Get in. We've got work to do.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE BUILDING BASEMENT - DAY
text: PAN OVER WEAPONS - they're all laid out on the floor. 50
scene_heading: cal. MACHINE GUNS, MINES, ROCKETS, BELTS OF AMMO.
text: We finally arrive at Xander leaning on his GTO. He sparks a
text: BLOWTORCH and lights a CIGAR.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I want all that...
dialog: (he pats the GTO)
dialog: In there.
text: Shavers looks on in shock. He's got a crew of MECHANICS with
text: him. Xander hands him the blowtorch and walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. PRAGUE OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY
text: This is a beautiful open air market in a town square
text: surrounded by old buildings. The place is PACKED.
text: In the midst of it all, we make out Petra moving through the
text: crowd. She stops to look at some vegetables when Xander passes
dialog: by her.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Right behind you.
text: They keep talking, pretending to shop.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: So what's the plan with this Ahab?
dialog: Are they selling it or what?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: No, something worse. He says it's a
dialog: surprise, but I know him. This is
dialog: his masterpiece.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: We've got to find out what it is.
dialog: Can you handle that?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There's something I didn't have time
dialog: to tell you before.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been
dialog: undercover for over a year.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You're what? What the hell have you
dialog: been doing?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: I don't know. Eight months ago I
dialog: stop hearing from my people. No
dialog: explanation, just silence. So I stay
dialog: and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm
dialog: in so far, they'd kill me if I left.
dialog: Now every day I get farther and
dialog: farther away from what I was. I'm
dialog: like you said, a criminal.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'm busted up for you, but Jesus,
dialog: what the hell are you doing? Those
dialog: people almost drowned on that boat
dialog: and you didn't lift a finger.
text: This stings her. She knows well the price she paid.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: No, I guess I've been no help at all
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Get your head back in the game. There
dialog: are lives at stake here.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Of course. I'll do what I can. I
dialog: have to go, before they notice.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: When can I see you again?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: You can't, it's too risky. I'm not
dialog: much help anyway, remember?
text: Then she's off into the crowd.
scene_heading: EXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - NIGHT
text: The craggy surface of the wall is swathed in shadows. Xander
text: approaches and flattens himself against it. He's all in BLACK,
text: packed with weapons and sporting a COMBAT VEST.
text: He grabs a toehold on the wall and ZOOM! He SPEED CLIMBS up
dialog: the side.
text: He reaches the top in seconds and scopes out the manor house.
text: VIDEO CAMERAS, PATROLLING GUARDS. It's not gonna be easy.
text: Xander slips over the wall down to the courtyard below.
scene_heading: EXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - NIGHT
text: Xander places an EXPLOSIVE on a CONTROL BOX.
text: He waits for a GUARD to stroll by and then slips through a
text: basement window.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - DARKENED ROOMS - NIGHT
text: Xander makes his way through a series of rooms. Finally he
text: finds himself in a study with a window overlooking the
text: CAVERNOUS BASEMENT of the Manor.
text: Laid out below he can see the AHAB DEVICE, hanging from
text: chains. TECHIES are working with the Anarchy 99 crew to
dialog: RETROFIT the thing.
text: They are installing a LAUNCHER RACK of TEN TUBES.
text: Xander can't hear a thing through the thick glass.
text: He takes a METAL BALL from his pocket. There's a sink in the
text: corner and he drops the metal ball down the drain.
scene_heading: INT. DRAIN PIPE
text: We follow the metal ball as it rolls through the trap and
text: down into the wall. The pipe zigzags around like a
text: rollercoaster and then levels off.
text: The ball rolls past a T-intersection, stops, and unrolls
text: like a pill bug.
text: Six metal legs appear and we see it's the ROACH CAM. It
text: scuttles back up the pipe and makes the turn.
scene_heading: INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT
text: We're close on a sink as the Roach Cam comes up the pipe. It
text: scurries into hiding just as a HAND reaches in to turn on
dialog: the water.
text: The roach peers out from between items on a workbench and we
text: PUSH IN on it's VIDEO CAMERA head.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT
scene_heading: CLOSE ON - VIDEO MONITOR - ROACH CAM P.O.V.
text: We see a handheld video image of Viktor.
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Okay, fire one.
text: Viktor pushes a button on Ahab and a VODKA BOTTLE launches
text: from tube one, SHATTERING against the ceiling.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Perfect!
text: Pull back to reveal Xander watching the image on his
text: communicator. Using a joystick he's able to control the roach.
text: He steers the camera towards Petra, gets a low-angle shot of
text: her legs in a punked-out CATHOLIC SCHOOL GIRL SKIRT.
text: He smiles, enjoying himself.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Great piece of hardware.
text: He plugs his earpiece in and listens in.
scene_heading: INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT
text: Petra works on a COMPUTER CONTROLLER.
text: The roach scurries across the floor, circling to get a better
dialog: look at Ahab.
text: Anders pushes a CART holding TEN GLASS CANISTERS OF LIQUID.
text: Each canister is separated in two, with a BLACK LIQUID on
text: top and a WHITE LIQUID on the bottom.
text: He hands the canisters to Viktor one by one.
speaker_heading: ANDERS
dialog: (singing)
dialog: "Silent Night... Holy Night"
text: Viktor laughs and joins in.
text: Then Kirill looks down and SPOTS THE ROACH CAM.
text: He STOMPS it with his boot.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT
text: Xander jerks out his earpiece and rubs his ear.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Damn.
text: He looks down into the room, sees Kirill bending down to
dialog: examine the roach. Time to go.
scene_heading: INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT
text: Kirill lifts the dead "roach" and sees its wires.
speaker_heading: KIRILL
dialog: There's some bullshit going on!
text: Yorgi hits an ALARM switch, alerting the guards.
text: The Anarchy boys grab weapons and start racing through the
dialog: house.
scene_heading: INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - VARIOUS - NIGHT
text: The Anarchy boys move swiftly from room to room in practiced
text: close combat maneuvers.
text: Cueing each other with hand signals, they run through each
text: room, weapons ready.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Xander sprints down the hallway. With the Anarchy 99 boys
text: and Guards roaming the house, he's having a hard time finding
text: his way out.
scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT
text: He runs into a darkened dining hall, sprints across only to
text: find the opposite door locked. He hides behind one of the
text: many COLUMNS as his pursuers enter the room.
text: Kirill gives a thumbs up and puts on a pair of NIGHT VISION
text: GOGGLES. He scans the big room but sees nothing.
text: Xander, hidden at the opposite end, waits breathlessly.
text: Kirill advances slowly, his buddies covering him from the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Xander, my friend, that can only be
dialog: you. Why don't we put our weapons
dialog: down for a few minutes and discuss
dialog: this like friends. How would you
dialog: like to come to work for us instead?
dialog: We could Rage Against the Machine
dialog: together.
text: Across the room, Xander sees a small window leading to the
text: courtyard. He has to run across open ground to reach it. He
text: calls out to Yorgi.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Speaking of people that are full of
dialog: shit, funny you should mention those
dialog: guys!
text: Xander's voice echoes around the empty hall, making it
dialog: impossible to pinpoint.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: They put their records out through
dialog: Sony, one of the biggest corporate
text: machines on the planet. Some
dialog: revolutionaries, huh?
text: He pulls out his gun as Kirill creeps ever closer.
text: Against the far wall Xander spots a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Come on, you're the one who's fooling
dialog: yourself. Why risk your life for
dialog: your government when we can offer
dialog: you a future that is truly free?
text: Kirill is almost on top of him.
text: Xander sights up and FIRES.
text: The fire extinguisher EXPLODES, blinding Kirill.
text: Xander makes a run for it.
text: Everyone FIRES WILDLY (except for Petra), bullets tearing
text: tapestries off the walls.
text: Xander dives and crashes through the window.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - SUNRISE
text: Xander tuck and rolls, comes up running.
text: Guards are running around, unsure just what the hell is going
dialog: on.
text: Xander hops on one of the TRIALS MOTORCYCLES parked nearby
text: and fires up the engine. He hits a remote switch and BLAM!
text: The EXPLOSIVE CHARGE he left earlier blows-up.
text: He points the bike at a set of STONE STAIRS. They form a
text: "ramp" that he can use to JUMP THE WALL. He GUNS THE ENGINE.
text: A Guard races across the wall with a rifle, taking aim.
text: Xander races and JUMPS THE BIKE over the wail. As he goes by
text: he does a CAN-CAN AERIAL, KICKING THE GUARD OFF THE WALL
text: before he can shoot.
text: The Anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: He blew the gate control. Anders!
dialog: Get the bastard!
text: Anders fires up the other trials bike, slings a submachine
text: gun across his back and goes up and over. Petra watches him
dialog: go, hoping for the best.
scene_heading: EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAYBREAK
dialog: (NOTE: action will be re-choreographed based on actual
dialog: locations. Any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated
dialog: by a physical reason)
text: Xander blazes down the street, Anders racing right behind
text: him. A wrong turn sends him into a dead end.
text: At the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall.
text: Xander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of
text: the truck and onto it's roof. Balancing on the rear wheel,
text: he hops onto the wall.
text: The machine gun blasts again. Xander drives off along the
text: top of the wall. Anders shoulders his gun and follows.
text: They are riding a 15' high wall that's only a foot wide.
text: They make several 90 degree turns, racing above a sleeping
text: neighborhood. Xander sees the end of the wall ahead and takes
text: a detour.
text: He hops onto the second floor balcony of a BUILDING UNDER
scene_heading: CONSTRUCTION.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MORNING
text: CONSTRUCTION WORKERS bolt out of the way as the motorcycle
text: leaps into their building.
text: Xander pops a wheelie and slams through a BLUEPRINT TABLE.
text: Anders follows, demolishing their SNACK TABLE.
text: Xander darts through the building, between beams and 2 x
text: 4's, until he reaches a skeletal STAIRCASE.
text: More WORKERS appear at the bottom of the stairs so Xander
text: goes up. He cranks up three flights of stairs and bashes
text: onto the roof.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MORNING
text: Xander looks around for a way out. The next building isn't
text: that far away. He revs up and JUMPS ACROSS.
text: Anders jams another magazine into his sub-machine gun and
text: follows Xander.
text: They jump from roof to roof, down a DESCENDING SERIES OF
text: ROOFTOPS towards the river. Anders pulls up alongside as
text: they race towards that last apartment building.
text: Neck and neck they head for the brink. At the last jump,
text: Xander pulls up behind Anders.
text: They hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel. Anders clamps
text: on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop, Xander right
text: behind him.
text: They skid to a stop at the very edge, with Anders balanced
text: on his front wheel. He looks down, sees street five stories
dialog: below.
text: He glances back at Xander, sweat beading, struggling to keep
text: his balance. Xander observes him coolly, totally in control.
text: Anders reaches for his machine gun. Xander pops a wheelie
text: and RAMS Anders over the edge.
text: The bike tumbles and PANCAKES into the pavement. Anders tears
text: through several AWNINGS before slamming into the ground.
text: Xander turns and rides to the next apartment building.
text: He hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually
dialog: take him to street level.
text: As he makes his way down, Anders stirs. The guy is a bloody,
text: broken mess but he gets to his feet. He sees where Xander is
text: headed and he scurries off to intercept him.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - MORNING
text: Xander is heading to the far end of a dead end alley. The
text: only way out is fenced in. But there's a RAMP leading up to
text: a LOADING DOCK. Xander will have to use that ramp to jump
dialog: the fence.
text: Anders climbs to the second floor of the building. There is
text: a small crane arm loaded with metal. If he pushes it at the
text: right time, it will swing out and knock Xander from his bike.
text: He giggles maniacally, blood dripping.
text: Xander drops down into the alley and heads towards the jump.
text: Anders times it perfectly and swings the crane arm out.
text: IN SLOW MOTION: The bike leaves the ramp and soars up over
dialog: the fence.
text: The crane arm swings out, on a collision course with Xander.
text: Xander sees it and THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE BIKE, grabbing
text: onto the back in a SUPERMAN SEAT-GRAB. He passes RIGHT
text: UNDERNEATH the swinging crane arm.
text: Anders's face falls when he sees Xander go by, hanging on
text: with ONE HAND. In his OTHER HAND Xander's got his PISTOL.
speaker_heading: BLAP!
text: Xander pulls himself back onto the bike and lands. He stops,
text: sees Anders' BLOODY HELMET come bouncing into the alley. He
text: tucks his pistol away and roars off.
scene_heading: INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY
text: Xander comes up the stairs and sees LIGHTS ON in his
text: apartment. He draws his gun and pushes the door open.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Slovo?
text: Slovo is sitting in the armchair.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Dude, what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: You killed me, remember? Now I have
dialog: to hide out here with you. Where
dialog: have you been?
text: Xander holsters his gun, searches around for his communicator.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I found something big enough for us
dialog: to take these guys down with. They've
dialog: got a of nerve agent they're gonna
text: unleash.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Is this what you're looking for?
text: Xander turns to see Slovo waving the communicator.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Yeah, give it here.
text: Slovo raises his pistol.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Sorry, "dude".
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (stunned beat)
dialog: What's the deal?
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got
dialog: played, so what? You're new at this.
dialog: Did you think you could just stroll
dialog: into this business one day and have
dialog: all the angles figured out?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Why you dogging me up?
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: They came and found me. They said
dialog: they'd kill me unless I help them.
dialog: Plus they offer me a lot of money.
dialog: No big deal. These things happen.
dialog: Dump your gun on the floor.
text: Xander does so.
speaker_heading: SLOVO
dialog: Where do you want it? The head to be
dialog: quick? Or the chest for an open
dialog: casket?
text: Suddenly GUNFIRE blasts through the closed door.
text: Bullets shatter a LAMP, a PICTURE, and finally tag Slovo in
text: a wild salvo.
text: Slovo crumples, never knowing what hit him.
text: The door creaks open. It's Petra, her gun still smoking.
dialog: She's with the Ivans.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What the hell are you doing? You
dialog: could've killed me!
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I heard you talking. I could tell
dialog: where you were in the room.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I don't know what's going on anymore.
dialog: I thought I was square with that
dialog: dude. Now everybody's switching sides
dialog: like it's the WWF.
text: The Ivans go to Slovo's body, kicking the gun from his hands.
text: One of them SPITS on his corpse in disgust.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What are you doing with the Ivans?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: I know which cops are good and which
dialog: are bad. Come with me. Come on, right
dialog: now.
text: She drags him to the door.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY
text: The beautiful and historic St. Charles bridge spans the river.
text: There are BANNERS hanging in celebration of the coming PRAGUE
text: PEACE CONFERENCE. Petra leads Xander across it.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: We're getting out of this place.
dialog: We've done enough.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go
dialog: now. What's Yorgi got planned with
dialog: that nerve agent?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: It doesn't matter anymore, forget
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: What do we owe our governments? Yours
dialog: kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Petra, this ain't about the people
dialog: that sent us here, you know that.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: No, now it's about us. Let's do
dialog: something for us before we both get
dialog: killed. Don't you want to get to
dialog: Bora Bora, Xander?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: We can't leave now. We have to do
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Why? You're the one who believes in
dialog: nothing. Screw the world, or whatever
dialog: you said.
text: Xander grabs her by shoulders.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Alright, so I was full of shit. I
dialog: thought believing in things was wrong.
dialog: Turns out believing in nothing is
dialog: worse. You might as well be dead.
dialog: I'm not thrilled with the world, but
dialog: I'm not gonna let those idiots start
dialog: killing people. Come on, you're a
dialog: cop, we've got to get these guys.
text: He's gotten through to her. She nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: PETRA
text: They left. To a fortress in the
dialog: mountains.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: We'll have to go after them.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Aren't you afraid?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: A long time ago I learned how to put
dialog: fear away in a little place in my
dialog: head. Maybe that's my problem. If
dialog: you don't feel fear you can do some
dialog: amazing things, but you can also
dialog: screw your life up in ways you can't
dialog: imagine.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: I must be healthy, then, because I'm
dialog: scared to death. I guess I'd better
dialog: get back to Yorgi.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You don't have to do that.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Yes, I do. You're right. I can't
dialog: just let him go free. Besides, I can
dialog: help you from the inside.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Aren't they gonna wonder were you've
dialog: been?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I was supposed to wait for the cop
dialog: to kill you and then kill the cop.
dialog: They'll believe me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've been lying for so long, one
dialog: more time won't hurt.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: When this is over, we're just gonna
dialog: take off, the two of us. Take a
dialog: vacation.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: What the hell are we doing? We're
dialog: doing all this together, trusting
dialog: each other, making plans, and we
dialog: haven't even slept together yet.
text: Xander kisses her.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: That gives us something to live for.
text: Together they walk back across the bridge. We crane up,
text: revealing the PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE banners all over a big
text: BUILDING on the river.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY
text: We see a craggy, gnarly mountain. The front side is a rock
text: strewn, near vertical drop.
text: Then we see Xander come scaling up from the back side. He's
text: got GEAR strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a
dialog: helluva climb.
text: Xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath. It's
dialog: beautiful up here.
text: He pulls a COLLAPSIBLE SNOWBOARD off his back, hits a switch
text: and the thing SWITCHBLADES OUT to full size. He clamps it on
text: his feet.
text: Xander moves to the edge and peers down. At the bottom of
text: the mountain he can see the CASTLE, an imposing medieval
text: fortress in the snow. He leans over the edge and starts down
text: the mountain. He doesn't get far before he notices something
text: else. He slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging
dialog: to rocks for balance.
text: On the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a
text: GUARD OUTPOST. Right now he's in full view and he's been
text: spotted. He sees GUARDS scrambling out, hopping on
text: SNOWMOBILES. From up here they look like ants.
scene_heading: EXT. GUARD OUTPOST - DAY
text: Viktor, the goateed cold weather warrior, strides out of the
text: Outpost and looks up the mountain. He shouts orders to his
dialog: men.
text: A Guard runs up and brings him his weapon: A FLAME-THROWER.
text: Viktor straps it on and. climbs onto his SNOWMOBILE.
text: All around him the Guards are driving into position. They
text: form a gauntlet of AK-47's. There must be a DOZEN of them.
text: Viktor rides up twenty yards and waits, his engine idling.
speaker_heading: VIKTOR
dialog: Hold positions!
text: He squints up at the speck that is Xander.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY
text: Xander pulls a CONCUSSION GRENADE from his jacket.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Nothing like fresh powder.
text: He puts his goggles on and pulls the pin from the grenade.
text: Then he TOSSES IT OVER HIS SHOULDER.
text: The grenade lands in the snow above him and starts ROLLING
text: DOWNHILL TOWARDS HIM. Xander pushes off and starts bombing
text: down the mountain.
text: The grenade bounces after him and then WHAM! It goes up with
text: a tremendous shock.
text: There is a SHIFT in the snow, a GROAN of shifting weight,
text: then the ENTIRE CORNICE cracks loose and topples over the
text: brink.
text: Xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at
text: his heels.
text: From down below it's an awesome sight. The slack-jawed Guards
text: watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them.
text: Shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer, they
text: can see Xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face.
text: There's a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles and
text: ride for their lives. A furious Viktor spins around and makes
dialog: a run for it as well.
text: Nobody has a chance. The avalanche is coming like a freight
text: train, frothing like white water.
text: Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hits a
text: JUMP. He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof
dialog: of the Outpost.
text: The avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everything
text: and everyone in its way.
text: Guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbling
text: under the onslaught.
text: Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over
text: the Outpost. He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a
dialog: stop.
text: Then it's all quiet.
text: Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble. There's
text: nothing moving up there anymore. Xander pulls himself free.
text: Then he hears a gushing sound and a DEEP BENEATH THE SURFACE,
text: he sees the WARM ORANGE GLOW OF FLAME. It's Viktor and his
text: flame thrower. There's another SPURT and the glow fades for
dialog: good.
text: Xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath. He's
text: right above the Castle now. Then his communicator starts to
speaker_heading: BEEP.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (into communicator)
dialog: Gibbons, long time no talk. You
dialog: wouldn't believe my day.
text: INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS ON THE PRIVATE JET WITH A TEAM OF
text: AGENTS.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: What the hell has been going on,
dialog: Triple X? How about a status report?
text: Xander looks down on the Castle. There seem to be MAFIYA
text: HENCHMEN all over the grounds.
speaker_heading: XANDER
text: Snow covered fortress. Army of bad
dialog: guys. The usual.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: I'm on the way with a team to relieve
dialog: you. What's the latest?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: They retrofitted Ahab with some kind
text: of rocket launcher. They were loading
text: canisters of liquid into it, light
text: colored and dark colored in the same
text: tube but separate. Something tells
dialog: me this it that "classified" stuff
dialog: you didn't want me to know about.
dialog: Does the song "Silent Night" mean
dialog: anything to you?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Yes it does.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Come on, Gibbons, you can do better
dialog: then that.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Silent Night is the name of a top
text: secret binary nerve agent. The glass
text: canister is shot into the air and
text: detonated. The black and white
text: chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud.
dialog: When it settles down to Earth, it'll
dialog: kill everything in the vicinity.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is
dialog: something we came up with?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Yeah, that's right. So now that you
dialog: know, you understand why it's
dialog: important that we get it back.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're
dialog: not supposed to be making weapons
dialog: like that anyway. Guess we shoulda
dialog: played by the rules.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Somebody else makes those decisions,
dialog: not guys like you and me. You've
dialog: done your job, X, head back to Prague.
dialog: I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This
dialog: is my operation now.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: We don't have that kinda time, boss,
dialog: I don't think Prague's gonna be around
dialog: much longer. I've gotta go now. I've
dialog: got a lot of bad guys to kill.
text: Xander hangs up and heads down the hill.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE - DAY
text: A GUARD patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle. He
text: stops for a smoke when Xander walks right up to him.
text: WHACK! With two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps
text: walking. He's a man on a mission.
text: He runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall. There's
text: no hand-holds, it's, a perfectly flat climb. A canyon of
text: ROCKS is below.
text: Xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the "TERMINATOR"
text: CLIMBING CLAWS. He pulls on the metal gloves and CLAWS into
text: the solid rock.
text: Just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface.
text: We see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making
dialog: this impossible climb.
text: At the top is an overhang. It's a gnarly transition. As he's
text: rounding it, his FEET SLIP. His legs dangle over the rocky
text: chasm below.
text: Using all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the
text: way with his climbing claws.
text: At the top a GUARD leans over, aiming his gun at him. Xander
text: grabs him and pulls him over the edge.
text: The Guard FALLS into the chasm.
text: Xander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted. Then another GUARD
text: rushes him, grabbing for his rifle.
text: Xander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun
text: from his hands. With the other hand he SLASHES, taking the
dialog: Guard down.
text: He pulls off the claws and heads into the Guard Tower.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY
text: Xander exits the Guard Tower at the ground level.
text: As he crosses the courtyard an EXPLOSION rocks the tower he
dialog: just left.
text: There is shouting as GUARDS race around the parapets, unsure
text: where the attack is coming from. A GUARD runs up to Xander.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (in Russian)
dialog: What's going on?
text: Xander CLOTHESLINES him and catches his AK-47 as he drops.
text: Up inside the castle he can see Yorgi at a window. Yorgi
text: appears mildly shocked as they make EYE CONTACT.
text: Xander takes aim.
scene_heading: POV ON XANDER THRU SNIPER SCOPE
text: From up above, Kirill has Xander in his sights.
text: BLAW! The bullet hits Xander's AK, sending it spinning.
text: Xander rubs his sore hand but stays put. Kirill could have
text: killed him and he knows it. From a doorway comes Yorgi with
dialog: some Guards.
text: Yorgi walks up and SMASHES Xander in the face.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: That was for Anders.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Don't forget goatee boy. I greased
text: him up on the diamond run.
text: Yorgi punches him again.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY
text: Petra sits at a desk working on a LAPTOP. Yorgi enters with
text: Xander and Kirill.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Look who we found playing outside.
text: Petra looks up. She can barely hide her shock.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Petra, my sweet dove, do you notice
dialog: anything strange about X? He looks
text: slightly less than dead.
text: Kirill aims his gun at Petra.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Yorgi, I thought he was --
dialog: Yorgi SLAPS her.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Do you think I didn't know about you
dialog: all along? My contacts in the KGB
dialog: told me you were coming. You show up
dialog: undercover and, I must admit, you
dialog: play your part to the hilt. When
dialog: it's time to be cruel, you are cruel.
dialog: When it's time to be passionate, you
dialog: are very very passionate indeed.
text: Petra is devastated by this revelation.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: I could have killed you, but I thought
dialog: this would be so much more fun. To
dialog: twist you and use you how I see fit.
dialog: And to be honest, you went much
dialog: farther than I ever expected you
dialog: would for your country.
text: He runs this fingers through her hair and moves on to Xander.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: And you. Why do you have such a
dialog: problem staying away, my friend? Did
dialog: you miss us that much?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I wanted to get the hell out of Prague
text: before Silent Night falls.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Not bad, man, not bad. You put things
dialog: together quick. Prague it is.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: The Peace conference...
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Nice place to start, don't you think?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's
dialog: the part I don't get. You gonna hold
dialog: the world hostage with your gas bombs?
dialog: I didn't think you were dumb enough
dialog: to go with that hack cliche.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: You think I'm after money? I told
dialog: you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a
dialog: change. Money is good, but for true
dialog: freedom you have to get rid of the
dialog: rules themselves.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: So all by yourself, you're going to
dialog: destroy every government; in the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Easier than that, buddy. I'll get
dialog: them to destroy each other. You kill
dialog: an entire Peace conference, someone
dialog: is going to have to pay. Then our
text: friend Ahab continues down the river
text: to the ocean and begins his world
dialog: tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty
dialog: soon everyone's involved. These guys
dialog: bomb those guys, those guys invade
dialog: these guys. Soon the whole world is
dialog: like your wild West cowboy days. No
dialog: rules, no law, everybody free to do
dialog: what they want.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Including rape, pillage, murder.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Sure, if that's what you want. Why
dialog: not? It's all human nature. So we
dialog: just have to launch our baby and
dialog: wait for the decline and fall of
dialog: civilization as we know it.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: And here I thought "anarchy" was
dialog: just something cool to put on a
dialog: Tshirt.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Come on, Xander. You used to stand
dialog: for something. What happened to you,
dialog: man? I thought you'd get it.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Don't you see, X? For the betterment
dialog: of humanity, he's going to start
dialog: World War Three.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: He's a regular humanitarian. And all
dialog: this time I thought he was just a
dialog: tool.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: You both could have been a part of
dialog: it. You could have ridden with us
text: into a new day, the dawning of a new
dialog: age of --
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry
dialog: I asked.
text: Yorgi's eye twitches.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Screw you too, buddy.
text: He raises his gun and suddenly BOOOOOM! A massive explosion
text: rocks the whole castle. Shrapnel shatters the windows,
text: spraying glass, and Yorgi's shot goes wide.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY
text: The front gates have just been blown apart. Through the smoke
text: and wreckage come Ivans 1 &amp; 2 with a PLATOON OF CRACK CZECH
text: SECRET POLICE. Their submachine guns rattle in threeshot
text: bursts, sweeping Guards from the parapets.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY
text: Kirill looks down at the carnage below. Xander takes advantage
text: of the distraction and charges at Yorgi.
text: Yorgi goes to shoot but his hand won't work. There's a HUGE
text: SHARD OF GLASS sticking through his forearm.
text: By the time he pulls it out, Xander is on top of him. He
text: body checks Yorgi, sending him flying over a desk. Kirill
text: spins and starts FIRING. Xander ducks for cover.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY
text: The Czech Secret Police are having their way. They cross the
text: courtyard and burst into the main building.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY
text: The Police whip through the building like lightening, mowing
dialog: down everyone in their path.
text: One Czech Secret Policeman is wounded and the others retaliate
text: with a volley of RPG's that evaporates a pocket of resistance.
text: In the main room upstairs, Kirill is blasting away. Yorgi
text: starts rounding up the computer gear.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: Hurry up, kill him!
text: Before Kirill can do so, Cops burst into the room, spraying
text: bullets everywhere.
text: Xander and Petra are pinned down, but Yorgi and Kirill manage
text: to make a fast exit out another door.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Hey! We're on your side!
text: The Cops keep shooting.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY
text: Ivan 1 is talking on the radio when Yorgi appears behind him
text: and shoots him in the back.
text: They step over him and enter a GARAGE.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE - GARAGE - DAY
text: The Ahab device is in the back of a flatbed TRUCK. Yorgi and
text: Kirill start up the truck and jam it into gear.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY
text: The truck smashes through the garage doors and rumbles across
dialog: the courtyard.
text: Police open fire, but the truck tears out the gate and starts
text: heading down the mountain.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY
text: Meanwhile, Xander and Petra are still pinned down.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Petra! Tell them something!
text: Petra starts calling out in RUSSIAN. Finally the cops stop
dialog: shooting.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY
text: Xander and Petra are brought outside. They see the Police
text: working on the wounded Ivan 1. Ivan 2 walks up.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: How's Ivan?
speaker_heading: IVAN 2
dialog: He is okay.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Thanks for coming, man, you guys
dialog: were right on time.
speaker_heading: IVAN 2
dialog: We are always on time. Two have
text: escaped, in truck.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Yorgi and Kirill.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Let me guess, they had a big white
dialog: torpedo with them.
speaker_heading: IVAN 2
dialog: Yes. Your friend, the angry one, he
dialog: send something for you.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE - DAY
text: A big truck pulls to a stop. Its ramp lowers and Xander's
text: blown-out '72 GTO comes rolling out.
speaker_heading: IVAN 2
dialog: We'll be right behind you.
text: Xander and Petra both strap on grenades and pistols.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Did you do your homework?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: (nods)
dialog: If they launch it, I know how to
dialog: bring it back.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Let's do this.
text: They both climb in and the GTO peels out.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY
text: Xander drives all out, trying hard to catch up.
text: He passes several of Ivan's Police Jeeps at a furious clip.
text: Up ahead they see the truck winding it's way down the
dialog: mountain.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Where's he headed?
speaker_heading: PETRA
text: He owns a big industrial complex on
dialog: the river. He'll launch it from there.
text: Xander floors it.
text: Up ahead, in the flatbed truck, Yorgi drives. He can see the
text: GTO gaining on them.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: (in Russian, subtitled)
dialog: They're coming! Get back there.
text: Kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab. He
text: lays down, resting the rifle on the Ahab container.
text: As the GTO comes into view, he sights up and FIRES, WHACK!
text: The first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows
text: the headrest off Xander's seat.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You get down! I'll take care of this
dialog: fool!
text: He pulls out an Mp-5 out and hangs it out the window.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: No! Don't shoot! He's hiding behind
dialog: the nerve agent!
text: Another shot blasts through, taking off the rear-view mirror.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Goddamit! He's gonna stop playing
text: around soon and shoot something
dialog: valuable!
text: Kirill laughs and takes aim once again. He puts Petra in the
dialog: sights.
text: Xander jerks the steering wheel and BLAM! the shot goes wide.
text: The GTO veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain.
text: Xander fights for control as they slide around the turns.
text: The road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex
text: up ahead. They cut across a field, heading right for it.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY
text: The truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex.
text: Quickly the gates are closed again. Armed GUARDS can be seen
text: up above.
text: The GTO comes at the gates at full speed.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Let's see what my man put together.
text: Xander opens a DASH PANEL, revealing a ROW OF SWITCHES. He
text: flips one.
text: The HEADLIGHTS EJECT, revealing a MINI-GUN IN EACH FENDER.
text: BRRRAAAAAAPPP!! The mini-guns spin.
text: The metal doors are getting SHREDDED.
text: Empty SHELLS spill down the sides of the GTO.
text: The metal doors come apart, falling in chunks.
text: The GTO slams through the wreckage without slowing down.
text: A Guard comes tumbling down and BOUNCES off the trunk as the
text: GTO zips inside.
scene_heading: EXT. INSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY
text: The Anarchy 99 guys seem to have a whole other army in here.
text: Guards spill onto the road, shooting at them from everywhere.
text: A BELLY PANEL on the GTO opens and ping-pong ball sized
text: MINIBOMBS dump onto the road. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The bombs
dialog: send the Guards scattering.
text: The GTO sizzles away.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Where'd the damn truck go?!
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Go to the water, it's that way!
text: A tactical (a pick-up with a .50 cal machine gun attached)
text: pulls up behind them and opens fire.
speaker_heading: XANDER
text: Toadies right behind.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Let me.
text: Petra punches another button.
text: The REAR HUBCAPS pop off. They roll along the road on their
text: own. Inside they seem to be LINED WITH SPIKES.
text: As the Tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they BLOW
text: UP, SPRAYING SPIKES at both sides of the Tactical.
text: All four wheels BLOW OUT and the Tactical goes out of control.
text: It crashes through a fence and pitches into the water, the
text: men going sprawling.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Fantastic options.
text: At the riverbank Yorgi and Kirill pull Ahab off the truck
dialog: and prepare for launching.
text: They remove it from it's box and carry it waist deep into
text: the water. Yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on Ahab's
dialog: insides.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: I've got it, go! Cover me!
text: Kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off.
text: He climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building
text: on a WHARF. From here he can shoot and NOT BE SEEN. He takes
text: his LIT CIGARETTE and tucks it behind his ear.
text: When the GTO rounds the corner he FIRES.
text: The bullet goes through the window and SLAMS into the steering
dialog: column.
text: Xander jams it into reverse. They retreat behind a building.
text: Petra clutches her arm, wounded.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: PETRA
text: A piece of shrapnel hit me.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop
dialog: playing nice.
text: Kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make
text: their second approach. The GTO comes roaring out, spinning
text: in circles wildly. Xander's is just doing donuts as fast as
dialog: he can.
text: Kirill aims, but with all the dust being kicked up he doesn't
dialog: have much of a target.
speaker_heading: KIRILL
dialog: What are you doing!
text: He doesn't notice Petra pop up from behind a fence with a
text: HEAT SEEKING MISSILE LAUNCHER.
text: ANGLE ON - the missile launcher's COMPUTER SCREEN. The green
text: display shows a faint red glow in the upstairs window. Its
text: the GLOWING POINT of Kirill's lit cigarette.
text: The Launcher BEEPS as it locks in and she FIRES.
text: Kirill looks up to see the missile blazing down the wharf at
dialog: him.
text: He gets it immediately. In a panic he fumbles for the
dialog: cigarette...
text: Too late. The missile zeroes in on his head.
text: WHOOOSH! The entire wooden shack blows apart.
text: Xander walks up to Petra.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I guess the surgeon general was right.
text: ANGLE ON - Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and let's it go. The
text: electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the river.
text: Xander and Petra run to the water's edge in time to see Yorgi
text: escaping in a MOTORBOAT. In the opposite direction they see
text: the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards it's destination.
text: Petra finds the CONTROLLER in the cab of the truck. She
text: presses buttons desperately.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: He's shut out the communication
dialog: circuit!
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You can't talk to it?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: No, it's like a safety. We are going
dialog: to have to access the manual controls.
speaker_heading: XANDER
text: A manual control on a moving torpedo.
dialog: This day keeps getting better and
dialog: better.
text: Xander starts running towards a second moored MOTORBOAT.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Radio Ivan! Tell him what's going
dialog: down! Have them evacuate downtown!
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVER - DAY
text: Yorgi is motoring away, smiling, when he glances back and
text: sees Xander and Petra take off after Ahab. He pounds on his
text: steering wheel and turns around. His bigger boat closes on
text: them and he reloads his weapons.
text: Xander drives while Petra checks her controller.
speaker_heading: PETRA
text: It's running three meters down. Twenty
dialog: knots.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: It has to surface to release the
dialog: nerve agent, right?
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: By then it's too late! The only way
dialog: to safely dispose of the nerve agent
dialog: is in deep water! The chemicals will
dialog: break down and dissipate!
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow
dialog: it up underwater!
text: They're heading into downtown Prague now, the riverbank
text: getting more and more populated. Yorgi is closing fast.
text: Down below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab beneath
dialog: the water.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: There it is! Hold it steady!
text: Petra pulls the pin on a grenade. She tosses it out in front
text: of Ahab. WHOOMPH! A jet of water goes up, but too far behind.
text: She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's
text: boat pulls up alongside. Yorgi aims and FIRES and the bullet
text: GRAZES Petra's arm.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Petra!
text: She loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the
text: engine compartment.
text: Xander grabs Petra and jumps. Together they land in Yorgi's
text: boat. The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge
text: support and shatters.
text: They are in the heart of the old city now. We see piazza's
text: full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing
text: in front of cathedrals. And on the river Yorgi and
text: Xander battle it out while Petra steers the boat.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: Xander! It's coming up!
text: Xander glances down, sees Ahab nearing the surface. Yorgi
text: clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat. Petra
text: tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm.
text: Xander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs
text: him from behind in a chokehold.
speaker_heading: YORGI
dialog: This is going to be exciting, buddy!
text: Front row seats to the apocalypse!
dialog: Come on, sing with me!
dialog: (singing madly)
dialog: "I am an Antichrist / I am an
dialog: anarchist / I... wan-na be...
dialog: Anarchy!"
text: Xander elbow's Yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold. He flips
text: him and they both topple overboard.
text: They land on Ahab and both grab on. They punch and pummel
text: each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding
text: torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St.
dialog: Charles bridge.
text: On the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF
text: PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from
dialog: the river.
text: Xander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi
text: slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in
text: the torpedo's wake.
text: Ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open.
text: Inside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing
text: Silent Night. The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: No you don't.
text: He pries the first rocket off it's launcher. The thing is
text: BEEPING menacingly.
text: IN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his
text: hands. He looks over at Petra. She's shouting at him, but he
text: doesn't hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT.
text: He looks the other direction, to the mass of PEOPLE on the
text: bridge above him. Total strangers...
text: The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former
dialog: nihilist.
text: Through the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with
text: his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact.
text: Then Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the
text: water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab
text: starts to DIVE.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
text: With Yorgi hanging on his back, Xander turns the rocket upside
text: down and stuffs it BACK IN THE LAUNCHER.
text: Ahab heads down to the bottom of the river, the two men
dialog: fighting.
text: We see one man get THROWN FREE, the other is caught up on
text: Ahab and continues downstream.
text: Then the booster rocket FIRES, giving off SPARKS and BUBBLES.
text: It's all in silhouette now as WHAM! The rocket EXPLODES,
text: setting off a CHAIN REACTION. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ahab and
text: it's unfortunate passenger are DISINTEGRATED by the BLASTS.
text: The chemicals BELCH OUT in harmless clouds.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVER - DAY
text: A FUNNEL OF WATER blasts into the sky. The crowd recoils.
scene_heading: EXT. THE RIVERBANK - DAY
text: Ivan 2 helps Petra off the motorboat. They look down at the
text: water, but there's no sign of Xander.
text: Gibbons and his men push through the cordon of POLICE,
text: scanning the water. Nothing.
text: Tears well in Petra's eyes. Even Gibbons looks dejected.
text: Then Petra let's out a gasp and they look downstream.
text: There's a boat ramp leading into the water. At first they
text: see a ripple, then the top of a SHAVED HEAD emerges.
text: The whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water,
text: walking up the boat ramp.
text: His shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered. But there's
text: a look on his face, a calm, a self-confidence we haven't
text: seen before. The Phoenix has risen.
text: Petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him. Xander
text: shakes Ivan 2's hand and then turns to Gibbons.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Thought you bought the farm down
dialog: there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: I'm pretty happy to see me too. So
dialog: are you done with me yet?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: You've kept up your end of the
dialog: bargain, I'll do the same. But you
dialog: really should consider staying on,
dialog: you make a decent agent.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: But I hate cops, remember? Except
dialog: for her.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there.
dialog: You're a hero. Don't be afraid to
dialog: join the good guys.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Who says you're the good guys?
text: He starts walking off with Petra.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: You know what they say, the only way
dialog: to change the system is from the
dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking
dialog: this thing off my ankle? The poison
dialog: needles?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: On come on, X. Did you really think
dialog: we were that barbaric?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: No needles, huh? What about the acid
dialog: bath?
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: All for show. Just a psychological
dialog: mind game to get you to do the right
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You're a jerk-off, you know that?
text: Gibbons waves.
speaker_heading: GIBBONS
dialog: We'll be talking soon, you'll see.
dialog: You'll be back.
text: Xander and Petra move off through the crowd arm in arm.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: I can't believe my mission is finally
dialog: over. I don't even know what to do
dialog: with myself.
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: You can't welch on me now. We had a
dialog: deal.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: ANGLE ON - a big "X" spelled out in SEASHELLS on the sand.
text: The camera shoots up into the sky, showing a perfect white
text: beach, a perfect lagoon, a lush green island... BORA BORA...
text: Then we hear the BUZZING of a TATTOO NEEDLE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A THIRD "X" BEING TATTOOED ON THE BACK OF XANDER'S HEAD.
scene_heading: INT. HUT - DAY
text: His ink done, Xander walks out onto the back deck.
scene_heading: EXT. BORA BORA - DAY
text: Craggy mountain peaks and perfect turquoise blue water.
text: Xander steps out of a hut built over the water.
text: We see Petra sprawled out on the deck in a bikini. She's got
text: a bucket of HINANO BEER chilling down. It's a vision of
dialog: heaven.
text: He lays down next to her, starts pulling her bikini bottom
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: PETRA
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: XANDER
dialog: It's about your next mission. You
dialog: need to be debriefed.
text: FROM UNDERWATER - we see the two of them dive into the lagoon
dialog: nude. There's too many bubbles to see any real skin, but we
dialog: know what they're up to.
text: Back on the surface we see BUBBLES rising and catch glimpses
text: of their outlines beneath the water.
text: The Camera pulls back to the deck, where we see Xander's
text: COMMUNICATOR on the table next to the beers. We hear them
text: surface and start SPLASHING off camera.
text: Then the damn communicator starts to BEEP.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
