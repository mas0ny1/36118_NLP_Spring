text: As Harry looks, a DROP of something WET strikes the word
text: “CHOSEN.” His gaze rises.
text: He GASPS. A substance DARK and GLUTINOUS is spattered

text: Dumbledore grabs his hand.
text: Training his light on Harry’s forehead, Dumbledore flicks

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Oi! Turn around, you lunatic.
text: Hermione spins, sees Harry and Luna approaching. In the
text: light of the hall, Harry’s blood-spattered face is quite
dialog: the sight.
speaker_heading: GINNY
dialog: He’s covered in blood again. Why
dialog: is it he’s always covered in
dialog: blood?
speaker_heading: RON
text: Looks like his own this time.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE

dialog: Sorting Hat urged us all to be
dialog: brave and strong in these troubled

dialog: it’s a hat, isn’t it? First Years
dialog: seemed to enjoy it, though.
dialog: Wankers. Filch give you the wand
dialog: outside?
text: Harry nods. Ginny, damp napkin in hand, begins to dab
text: his face, then feels suddenly awkward. Harry takes it
dialog: from her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Thanks...
text: Just then, the light in the Hall begins to gently dim and
text: all eyes turn to Dumbledore, standing at the top of the
text: Hall, ashen hand raised to the enchanted ceiling, where
text: clouds respond to his gestures and shroud a gleaming full
dialog: moon.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: What’s happened to his hand?
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: The very best of evenings to you!
dialog: First off, please join me in
dialog: welcoming the newest member of our
dialog: staff, Horace Slughorn.
text: MILD APPLAUSE ensues. Harry claps perfunctorily, his
text: eyes drifting to the entrance of the Hall as a pair of
text: Aurors station themselves just outside.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to
dialog: say, has agreed to resume his old
dialog: post of Potions master. Meanwhile
dialog: the post of Defense Against the
dialog: Dark Arts will be assumed by
dialog: Professor Snape.
text: This is greeted by stunned silence. Dumbledore frowns,
text: then attempts to generate something by CLAPPING his hands
text: once. A few Slytherins join in and some dim-witted First
dialog: Years.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Now, as you know, each and every

dialog: Walked this castle’s corridors.
text: Slept beneath its roof. He
dialog: seemed, to all the world, a
dialog: student like any other. His name?
dialog: Tom Riddle.
text: The Hall goes utterly silent.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Today, of course, the world knows
dialog: him by another name. Which is
dialog: why, as I stand looking out upon
dialog: you all tonight, I am reminded of
dialog: a sobering fact. Each day, every
dialog: hour, this very minute perhaps,
text: dark forces attempt to penetrate
dialog: this castle. But in the end,
dialog: their greatest weapon remains...
dialog: you.
text: Harry eyes Malfoy, slouched low, lazily levitating a fork
text: with his wand, as if Dumbledore were unworthy of
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Just something to keep in mind.
dialog: Now, off to bed. Pip pip!
speaker_heading: RON

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING 41

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
dialog: History of Magic is up, ladies,

dialog: Enjoying ourself, are we?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, you see, I’ve got an open
dialog: period this morning, Professor --
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
dialog: So I noticed. I would think you’d
dialog: want to fill it with Potions. Or
dialog: is it no longer your ambition to
dialog: become an Auror?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It is. Or was. But I was told I
dialog: had to get an Outstanding in my
dialog: O.W.L. --
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
dialog: And so you did when Professor
dialog: Snape was teaching Potions.
text: However, Professor Slughorn is

speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: Harry m’boy! I was beginning to
dialog: worry! And I see we've brought
dialog: someone with us...
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Ron Weasley, sir. But I’m dead
text: awful at Potions, a menace
dialog: actually, so I probably should
dialog: just be going --
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: Nonsense, we’ll sort you out. Any
text: friend of Harry’s is a friend of
dialog: mine. Right then, books out --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Um, sorry, sir, but I haven’t got
dialog: my book yet -- nor’s Ron. You
dialog: see -- (until this morning...)
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: Not to worry. You can get what
dialog: you need from the cupboard.
text: As Harry and Ron step to the cupboard, Slughorn resumes,
text: gesturing to the cauldrons bubbling before him.
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: Now, as I was saying, I’ve
dialog: prepared a few concoctions this
dialog: morning. Any ideas what these
dialog: might be? Yes, Miss...?
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Granger, sir. That one there is
dialog: Veritaserum. And that would be
dialog: Polyjuice Potion. And that...
text: In the cupboard, Harry and Ron find two TEXTBOOKS -- one
text: new, one shabby and soiled. Both snatch for the new when
text: a box -- marked “BEZOARS” -- tips. As Harry makes a grab
text: for it, Ron wrests free the new textbook and goes off

speaker_heading: HERMIONE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s rumored to smell differently
dialog: to each person, according to what
dialog: attracts them. For example, I
text: smell freshly mown grass and
dialog: new parchment and spearmint
dialog: toothpaste --
text: Hermione blushes, stops herself. Slughorn regards her.
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: One of my best friends is Muggle-
dialog: born. She's the best in our
dialog: year...
text: Harry, settling into his seat with the soiled textbook,
text: looks up just as Slughorn’s eyes shift to him for
text: confirmation. As Harry nods, Hermione glances curiously
text: at him.
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: Now Amortentia doesn’t create
dialog: actual love, of course. That’s
dialog: impossible. But it does cause a
dialog: powerful infatuation or obsession.
dialog: For that reason, it is probably
dialog: the most dangerous potion in this
dialog: room.
text: Slughorn turns, finds a sea of dreamy faces leaning into
text: the VAPORS. Instantly, he CLANGS a cover onto the
text: cauldron, bringing them round. As Ron blinks, he finds
text: Lavender still staring dreamily -- at him. Noticing,
text: Hermione’s eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: KATIE BELL
dialog: Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in
dialog: that one.
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: Ah yes...
text: Slughorn steps to a SMALL BLACK CAULDRON. Begins to
text: ladle a bit of GOLDEN LIQUID into a TINY VIAL.
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: What you see before you, ladies
dialog: and gentlemen, is a curious little
dialog: potion known as Felix Felicis.

speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: Yes, Miss Granger. Desperately
dialog: tricky to make. Disastrous should
dialog: you get it wrong. But brewed
dialog: correctly, as this has been, it
dialog: has remarkable powers. One sip
dialog: and you will find that all your
dialog: endeavors succeed... at least
text: until the effects wear off.
speaker_heading: KATIE BELL
dialog: But then why don’t people drink it
dialog: all the time?
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: Because taken in excess it causes
dialog: giddiness, recklessness and
dialog: dangerous overconfidence.
speaker_heading: BLAISE
dialog: Have you ever taken it, sir?
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: Twice. Once when I was twenty-
dialog: four. Once when I was fifty-
text: seven. Two tablespoons taken at
dialog: breakfast. Two perfect days...
text: Slughorn eyes the vial dreamily, adrift. Finally he
text: blinks.
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: So. This is what I offer each of
dialog: you today. One tiny vial of
dialog: liquid luck... to the student who,
dialog: in the hour that remains, manages
dialog: to brew an acceptable Draught of
dialog: Living Death, the recipe for which
dialog: can be found on page ten of your
dialog: textbook.
text: Excitement seizes the class. Slughorn smiles knowingly.
speaker_heading: SLUGHORN
dialog: You should know that in all the
dialog: years of my previous tenure at
dialog: Hogwarts, not once did a student
dialog: brew a potion of sufficient
dialog: quality to claim this prize. In
dialog: any event -- good luck.
text: Slughorn sets the vial upon his desk, where it SHIMMERS

dialog: “Cut up one Sopophorous bean.”
text: Harry takes the SILVER DAGGER upon his desk, poises it
text: over the BEAN when... Ron’s bean shoots across the room
text: and bounces off Katie Bell’s head. Harry surveys the
text: rest of the room: everyone is struggling to cut the
text: resistant legume. He glances back to his book, considers
dialog: the instruction again.
dialog: As ARROW has been drawn from the word “Cut” to the
dialog: margin, where a modification has been written in the
dialog: tight scrawl:
dialog: “Crush with blade -- releases juice better.”
text: Harry considers the dagger in his hand, then places the
text: flat of the blade against the bean and presses.
text: Instantly, the protective parchment covering the desk
text: runs RED with juice.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: How did you do that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Crush it. Don’t cut it.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: No. The instructions specifically
dialog: say to cut.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No. Really --
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Sh!

dialog: It was a student who gave me

speaker_heading: SNAPE

speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
dialog: Whether it has or hasn’t is

text: Harry stands poised, peering upward, where Dumbledore
text: squints toward the dying sun and Snape glares at his

speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE
text: One wintry afternoon, he lured two

dialog: Perhaps not.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Dumbledore leads Harry on. Stops. Takes a step back.
text: He CLOSES HIS EYES and to Harry’s horror walks right to

text: his shoes, Dumbledore PASSES HIS HAND slowly through the
text: air, then closes it... as if gripping something

text: TAP and a thick coppery-green CHAIN appears out of thin
text: air, extending from the water to Dumbledore’s hand.
speaker_heading: DUMBLEDORE

speaker_heading: HARRY

text: Malfoy’s wand rises once again. Harry raises his own,

text: splinters through the columns to his right. He looks,

text: Carefully, Snape draws his wand, then turns to Harry, a
text: finger to his lips: Shhh. Then he is drifting upward.
text: Silent. A ghost again.

text: Harry’s eyes dart back and forth frantically, trying to

dialog: rises.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Avada Kedavra!
text: A JET of GREEN LIGHT hits Dumbledore squarely in the
text: chest. For a second he hangs, suspended upon the
text: ramparts, and then... the night swallows him.
text: HARRY SCREAMS in RAGE. Bellatrix raises her wand to the
text: sky and a DEAFENING BLAST shakes the castle, masking
text: Harry’s cry. The CLOUDS EXPLODE with GRIM LIGHT,
text: mutating into a SKULL. As the Death Eaters flee, Snape’s
text: arm drops limply to his side.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: You can no longer stay here.
text: Draco, stunned, stares at the empty place where

text: the scruff of the neck, forces him through the door, then
text: follows.
text: Harry scrambles up the stairs and lurches to the
text: ramparts, BATHED IN THE GREEN LIGHT from above. He peers
text: down. Agony wrecks Harry’s face and he has to steady

text: then steps to the TOWERING DOORS of the Hall, peering
text: upward, past the FLOATING CANDLES to the vaulted ceiling,
text: solemn as a church. Raising her wand, she sends a FIERY
text: BOLT toward the GRAND WINDOW opposite. As it EXPLODES, a
text: BLAST of COLD AIR sweeps the room, EXTINGUISHING THE
text: CANDLES. Snape turns, looks back. Bellatrix simply
text: GRINS, a mad child.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132D

scene_heading: EXT. HAGRID’S HUT / GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 134

text: stands paralyzed.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Go on!
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - HARRY
text: Running. Harry bolts forth, wand in hand, vengeance in
text: his eyes. Up ahead, Snape stands stolidly, tall and
text: black against the raging fire. Harry points his wand,
text: fires a JET of RED LIGHT. Snape doesn’t move, merely
text: lets it streak by his head. Harry stops, chest heaving,
text: and takes aim again.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Cruciatus!
text: Snape raises his wand, parries the curse with ease.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Incacerata!
text: Once again, Snape deflects the spell.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Impedimenta!
text: Another lazy flick of the arm, another curse defeated.

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Fight! Fight back, you coward!

speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Don’t ever associate that word and
dialog: my name again.
text: Harry raises himself up on one knee, points his wand

speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: No! He belongs to the Dark Lord!

speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: You dare use my own spells against

text: Harry goes still. His eyes shift, meet Snape’s.
speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: You may have gotten your mother’s

dialog: Half-Blood Prince.
text: Snape kicks Harry’s wand aside and turns away, joining
text: Malfoy and the others where they wait beyond the flaming
text: ruins of Hagrid’s Hut. They head for the darkness of the
text: treeline. And VANISH. Harry pounds his fist into the
text: ground, then stops.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hagrid... HAGRID!

text: Ron, Hermione and Ginny stand with the staff. They turn
text: and watch the throng of students part for Harry and
dialog: Hagrid.
text: Hagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees. Harry
text: pushes on, kneels. Dumbledore’s eyes are closed, his
text: face peaceful. Harry straightens his half-moon
text: spectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth.
text: Runs the back of his hand, gently, over the weathered
dialog: cheek.
text: Then he notices something lying beside Dumbledore’s ashen
text: hand: the locket. He takes it, considers it numbly.
text: Then begins to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his
text: body. Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and she steps
text: forward, drops beside him. At her touch, his head falls
text: on her shoulder and she begins to stroke him. Ron looks
dialog: on. Understands all.
text: McGonagall lifts a trembling wand to the sky and slowly
text: the TIP GLOWS to life. One after another, students and

text: The door eases OPEN and Harry enters. For a moment, he
text: simply stands staring. Taking inventory. Spying
text: something, he crosses to the great desk opposite. Looks
dialog: down.
text: Dumbledore’s wand.
text: Reaching out, Harry takes it in hand. Old, oft-used and
text: bearing the impression of its owner’s fingers, it is a
text: strangely beautiful object. Harry traces his thumb
text: lightly over the wood, transfixed, when...
text: .«.. McGonagall enters.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
dialog: Potter.
text: He doesn’t respond, lost in the wand. McGonagall’s eyes
text: drift to it, briefly, then study Harry’s face. She
text: frowns, trying to call forth some words.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
dialog: Potter, in light of what’s
dialog: happened... should you feel the
dialog: need to talk to someone...
text: She falters. Harry gently sets the wand back upon the

dialog: look.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
dialog: You should know... Professor
dialog: Dumbledore...
text: Harry turns then, studying her drawn face, no words
text: necessary. At a loss, she finishes quietly:
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
dialog: You meant a great deal to him.
text: Harry’s eyes rise. High upon the wall, the past
text: Headmasters snooze in their frames. The last looks
text: remarkably peaceful, the trace of a smile on his lips as
text: he sleeps.
