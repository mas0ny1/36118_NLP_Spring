scene_heading: THIS APPEARS ON BLACK SCREEN:
text: O unteachably after evil, but uttering truth.
dialog: - Gerald Manley Hopkins
scene_heading: EXT. THE ALASKAN FRONTIER - DAY
text: SUNLIGHT, as bright and sharp as a blade, slicing down on
dialog: this moonscape of SNOW and ICE. Feel the cold in your teeth.
text: The wind makes a faint flute-sound and all else is silence.
text: In the distance sit god-sized hills, hazy and dream-like. And
text: spread before them, abutting a black bristle of trees...
text: A VILLAGE. Just a handful of buildings, looking like toy
text: blocks dropped onto a clean white quilt.
dialog: SUPER: Keelut, Alaska.
dialog: How do people even survive out here? And why?
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND THE SLONE CABIN - DAY
text: Not so much a backyard as an expanse between the distant
text: TREELINE and a roughly-hewn LOG CABIN, smoking chimney and
text: mossy walls, a soft rhythmic wump wump wump leading us to...
text: A BOY (7), kneeling to pack a small mound of snow. Wump,
text: wump, wump. He looks swollen in his pillowed coat, working a
text: well-used ARMY MAN into the mound. His name is BAILEY.
text: His nose running, his breath clouding before his face, he’s
dialog: wholly focused on this very serious work until...
text: He looks up. Sees something. Freezes.
text: A WOLF. Just emerged from the trees. Motionless. Yellow eyes
text: fixed on Bailey, her own breath steaming. She’s huge.
text: ON BAILEY, seen from behind, looking out at the WOLF, only
text: forty feet away. Watching him in silence.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - TWILIGHT
text: A TEA KETTLE on a wood stove alllmost whistles but a FEMALE
text: HAND lifts it out of frame as we begin to...
text: Drift through the space, catching the details. Three rooms
text: with a small kitchen area. A low insulated ceiling with
text: plastic sheets duct taped over the windows.
text: A pair of FUR-LINED BOOTS, knee-high and heavy, wait by the
text: front door where an AR-15 RIFLE is propped in the umbrella
text: stand. A child’s .22 RIFLE leans in the corner.
text: A CB RADIO hangs from a peg next to the CLOSET DOOR with a
text: PADLOCK on it. No phone that we can see.
text: There’s a ratty COUCH with unfolded laundry on it. A sooty
text: FIREPLACE smolders with a COMPOUND BOW hung above the mantle.
text: And like an afterthought, a CRUDE MASK rests on the mantle,
text: made of driftwood and pelt. A wolf face.
text: We find the WOMAN, sitting very still in a threadbare chair,
text: wearing a thick wool sweater, an untouched cup of tea in her
dialog: lap.
text: Her name is MEDORA SLONE (30). Underfed, distant, with
text: striking white-blond hair and pale, grey-gold eyes.
text: She's just staring. At nothing, it seems. The wind keens
text: faintly outside. The house creaks.
text: Finally, she looks up.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR DOOR - SLONE CABIN - SAME
text: The heavy door opens inward and Medora peers out, hugging
dialog: herself against the cold.
scene_heading: INT. REAR DOOR - SAME
text: Over her shoulder, OUT THERE: that snow mound Bailey was
text: making. And the action figure still stuck into it.
text: But no Bailey. No nothing. Just the field of white, the
text: fading daylight all the way to the darkness of the trees.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: IN BLACKNESS, A WOLF HOWL carries from some far unknowable
text: place...but then morphs into a DRONING ELECTRIC BUZZ...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CORE’S HOME - NIGHT
text: Which is a MICROWAVE, a TV dinner turning inside until it
text: beeps! and MALE HANDS gingerly remove it.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - CORE’S HOME - NIGHT
text: A PAINTING OF A WOLF, an amateur work. From 0.S., we hear a
text: MAN, apparently leaving a voicemail message...
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Hi, sweetheart. Uh. It’s me. Again.
text: There are in fact several WOLF PAINTINGS here. Dozens.
dialog: Different angles and settings but...the same animal?
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd heard you got Associates, huh?
dialog: I read that, Northern Light had a
dialog: blurb on it. Tenure committee gets
dialog: one right, at last. Heh. I’m uh...I
dialog: am so proud of you.
text: We drift over the DESK and COMPUTER, BOOKS and PAPERS hoarded
dialog: neatly. Titles like Canis Lupus Migration Study, American
text: Nature Journal, Arctic Grey In Decline. An academic’s lair.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you're busy, but...I hope
dialog: we'll talk sometime. You can call
dialog: whenever. I hope uh...
text: Here’s a PHOTO OF A YOUNG BEARDED MAN in muddy camping gear,
text: grinning hugely, a caption on it: Yellowstone, 1979.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway. I’m going to see your
dialog: mother tomorrow. She sends her
dialog: love.
text: We find him in his overstuffed recliner, the TV muted, his
text: microwave dinner on a tray. His name is RUSSELL CORE (50s),
text: the guy from the photo. But there’s silver in his hair now,
text: more in his beard. This is a tired man. He carries ghosts.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: And...so do I.
text: He holds the phone to his ear a beat longer...and hangs up.
text: Aims the remote, turns up the news a bit: Iraq, circa 2004.
speaker_heading: TV NEWS VOICE
dialog: ..-while Coalition forces advanced on the
text: town of Falujah under heavy fire...
dialog: But Core isn’t really watching, is he?
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Core sits in the steaming bathtub, the water to his chin.
text: Staring at something. Grimly contemplating it.
text: A RAZOR BLADE. Resting there on the edge of the tub. Waiting.
text: He stares. Takes a deep breath for courage. Or maybe defeat.
text: And reaches for the blade...
text: His dripping hand hovers over it in sudden indecision. The
dialog: moment extends. Until...
text: He retracts his hand after all. Leaves the razor there.
text: Exhales and looks away.
scene_heading: EXT. REST HOME - WALLOWA, OREGON - DAY
text: It’s bright and sunny. Not the cold-diamond sunshine of
text: Keelut but sunshine with some actual warmth. Trees are green.
text: CORE’S COMPACT CAR pulls up, parks, and he heads inside.
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION HALLWAY - REST HOME - DAY
text: As Core passes the Christmas-decorated DESK, the young NURSE
text: in a Santa hat gives him a small, sweet smile.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Hi, Kelly.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Hi, Mr. Core. She’s having a good
dialog: day.
text: He smiles back, as best he’s able.
scene_heading: INT. CORE’S WIFE’S ROOM - REST HOME - DAY
text: A WOMAN'S HAND, gnarled into a frozen claw on a hospital bed.
text: It’s CORE’S WIFE, her mouth agape, eyes clamped shut to give
text: the impression that she’s perpetually moaning. But she’s not,
text: of course, she’s been paralyzed and unconscious for years.
text: Core sits bedside her, reading a novel. He bites a candy
text: cane, the crunch! like a bone breaking in this quiet room.
text: A soft, involuntary glottal noise gurgles in his Wife’s
text: throat. He looks up at her for a long beat but, when no other
text: sound comes, he returns to his book.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - CORE’S HOME - DAY
text: THE PILE OF MAIL on the welcome mat is pushed aside as the
text: front door opens and Core’s LIGHTWEIGHT HIKING BOOTS step in.
text: He hangs up his windbreaker, drops his keys, bends with a
text: grunt to collect the mail, pausing then to look at his--
text: ANSWERING MACHINE, with ‘0’ messages waiting for him.
dialog: Which is deeply disappointing.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - DAY
text: Core settles into his recliner, thumbing idly through the
dialog: mail until...this one LETTER in particular.
text: KEELUT, AK, reads the return address. A childlike scrawl.
text: Confused, he opens it, unfolds the single page, begins to
text: read. And the color drains from his face.
text: MACRO ON THE LETTER, we’re reading it, ‘DEARMR CORE, THREE DAYS
text: AGO MY SON BAILEY WAS TAKEN BY WOLVES’ even as we hear--
speaker_heading: MEDORA (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Mr. Core, Three days ago my
dialog: son Bailey was taken by wolves.
text: He reads, horribly spellbound...
speaker_heading: MEDORA (V.O.)
dialog: This happened twice already here. I
dialog: tried to track them but could not.
dialog: No one in the village will hunt
dialog: them. I am alone here now. I have
dialog: read your book. I know you have
dialog: done this before. In my heart, I
dialog: know that you are able to do it
dialog: now. I do not expect you to find my
dialog: son alive. But you could find his
dialog: bones and maybe slaughter the wolf
dialog: that took him. My husband will come
dialog: home from the war soon. I must have
dialog: something to show him. I can't just
dialog: have nothing. I know you have
dialog: sympathy for this animal. Please
dialog: don't. Come and kill it to help me.
dialog: My son's bones are in the snow.
text: He sits there, surrounded by all those paintings.
speaker_heading: MEDORA (V.O.)
dialog: Sincerely yours, Medora Slone.
text: A stunned, silent beat.
text: He refolds the letter, sets it aside. And looks away.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - DAY
text: CORE’S HANDS, scrubbing vigorously under the sink.
text: IN THE MIRROR, Core blots his brow, finds his own anxious
text: eyes for a moment. Takes a deep breath and then, oddly...
text: A MAN with luggage passes behind him. Oh. He’s not at home.
scene_heading: INT. PORTLAND AIRPORT - DAY
text: Core emerges from the MEN’S ROOM with his small rolling
text: suitcase, heads towards the bustling CHECK-IN COUNTER.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL AIRLINER - NIGHT
text: JET NOISE drowns everything as we find Core in a window seat,
text: dozing. His eyes slit open and, vaguely disoriented, he gazes
text: out at the dreamy purple sky.
text: And he’s holding MEDORA’S LETTER, folded into quarters.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: Core moves through this minor almost-empty hub, passing some
text: HUNTERS headed the other way.
scene_heading: INT. CAR RENTAL DESK - AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: Core fills out paperwork as the sullen CLERK provides keys.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Four wheel drive?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (‘of course’ )
dialog: Yessir.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: And uh...GPS?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Where you headed?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Keelut.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: GPS won’t work out there. Here...
dialog: (passing him a MAP)
dialog: ...this one the more accurate ones.
dialog: Core regards the map and...
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - DAWN
text: CORE’S RENTAL SUV drives away on a salt-crusted strip of road
text: that runs to infinity, brown-white tundras spreading to
dialog: either side.
text: The sky is an ominous golden-pink, like a great inverted bowl
text: refracting weird light. The truck grows small beneath it.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. RENTAL SUV - REMOTE ALASKAN ROADS (VARIOUS) - DAY
text: Core drives one-handed, uncertainly consulting the map and
text: scanning for landmarks. Scanning for anything.
text: The SUN remains low in the sky. Long shadows, fewer buildings
dialog: to be seen, much more snow.
text: He sees distant shapes of CARIBOU moving along frozen water.
text: He sees WHIRLS of snowy wind, miniature sideways tornados.
text: He sees a LONE FIGURE in a DOG SLED whisking across the
text: plains, drawn by a bounding team of HUSKIES.
text: He drives onward. Medora’s FOLDED LETTER rides shotgun.
scene_heading: EXT. FILLING STATION - DAY
text: From afar, we see Core approach a TRUCKER at the pumps.
text: Closer, Core shows the map, points questioningly to a certain
dialog: point.
text: The Trucker looks at it (check that eagle tattoo over his
text: eye), shakes his head, chuckles wetly.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL SUV (MOVING) - DAY
text: THIS ROAD is unpaved and snowy, so Core drives slow, hunched
text: over the wheel. Drifts like seawalls rise on either side.
text: He slows now, squinting--
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD at the road curving upwards into a
text: HILLY WOODED PASS, seeming to disappear before him.
text: With a frustrated hiss he re-checks the map. Useless. He
text: wipes his fogged-over window, scanning as he drives--
text: Wait. He stops suddenly.
scene_heading: EXT. REMOTE ROAD - SAME
text: THE SUV backs up, pausing beside a tree with a small
text: RECTANGULAR SOMETHING nailed to it.
text: Core rolls down his window for a better look at...
text: The faded, hand-painted WOODEN SIGN. “Keelut.”
scene_heading: EXT. KEELUT - DAY
text: A TOTEM POLE rises into the sky: the carved faces of bears,
text: owls, dogs, and devils keeping solemn watch over all.
text: Below it we find ILLANAQ (80s), looking out in watchful
text: expectation. Filthy anorak, long braided hair. She’s Yup’ik,
dialog: the indigenous people of Keelut.
text: CORE’S RENTAL SUV appears slowly up the main (indeed, the
text: only) road of Keelut, pausing now below the totem pole.
text: He rolls down his window, calls up to her...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Excuse me...
text: She just stares at him.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: The Slone cabin?
text: Her cracked-leather face splits into a smirk and...
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ
dialog: (gesturing)
text: At the end.
text: Core nods thanks, but warily, and drives on.
text: Illanag watches him go.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. RENTAL SUV (MOVING) - KEELUT - SAME
text: The truck jounces on the rocky ground. Core scans the
text: village, little more than two rows of buildings and the road
dialog: between. Nobody’s out that doesn’t need to be. He sees:
text: A-FRAMES and STURDY CABINS, solid and stubborn, every chimney
text: working, radio antennae spiking from every roof. Animal skins
text: tacked to doors and stacks of cordwood close by.
text: SNOW-MOBILES and CHAIN-TIRED TRUCKS with electric blankets
text: draped over their engines, nosed into massive muddy drifts.
text: PLYWOOD KENNELS for teams of HUSKIES chained by their SLEDS,
text: indifferent to the cold, gnawing on bones.
text: A FEW YUP’IK KIDS dart across the road, shouting.
text: A TALL YUP’IK MAN (30s), his long hair drawn back into a
text: ponytail, unloading supplies from his truck, scowling at Core
text: as he passes.
text: There’s a CHURCH, a SCHOOLHOUSE, a WOODEN WATER TOWER and a
text: sorry-looking PUB. The GENERATOR SHACK grumbles and smokes.
dialog: Pure functionality and self-reliance. Zero gloss.
text: And now he sees it. Up ahead at the edge of Keelut, almost
text: outside of Keelut...the SLONE CABIN.
scene_heading: EXT. SLONE CABIN - CONTINUOUS
text: The road ends. He parks and glances around before wading
text: through knee-high snow up towards the cabin where...
text: A RUSTY RED TRUCK is parked. Caribou antlers hang over the
text: door. Maybe a welcome, maybe a warning. As he gets closer...
text: The door opens. Medora Slone appears, uncertainly, holding a
text: dog-eared PAPERBACK BOOK to herself.
text: A moment, the two of them looking at each other across the
text: distance to her door.
text: FROM OVER MEDORA’S SHOULDER, we see her lift the book,
text: consult the AUTHOR’S PHOTO on the back: it’s that Yellowstone
dialog: picture we saw in Core's house.
dialog: 10.
text: And just beyond it, there’s Core in the flesh, but stooped
text: slightly and breathing hard as he approaches.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - DAY
text: THE KITCHEN TABLE is stacked with dishes of food villagers
text: have brought: caribou soup, fry bread, pies and canned fruit.
text: Core sits by the wood stove, a fresh cup of tea in his hands.
text: He looks up from those HEAVY FUR-LINED BOOTS in the corner to
text: stare uncomfortably across at--
text: Medora, who sits on the couch, straight-backed, unblinking.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: I didn’t think you’d really come.
dialog: When I wrote you I was...I guess I
dialog: was going to try anything.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I’m uh...I am very sorry about your
dialog: son, Mrs. Slone
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: (re: book)
dialog: Canis lupus.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Yes, ma’am.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: “Apex predator.” What’s that mean?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: It means they’ve been around a long
dialog: time and know how to hunt better
dialog: than we do.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: You’ve come to kill it? To kill the
dialog: animal that took him?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I came to help if I can. To explain
dialog: this if I can.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: The explanation is we’re cursed
dialog: here. The only help is to kill it.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I’m just a writer.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: You’ve hunted and killed one
dialog: before. That’s what you wrote.
text: He winces at that statement, it actually pains him. She hands
text: him the book as if to say, See? He turns it over...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Where'd you find this?
dialog: A Year Among Them, it’s called, wolves on the cover.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: It found me. I don’t know how. It
dialog: was just here one day.
text: Says that in the same tone as, At the bookstore. He resets.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: You mentioned his bones.
text: She looks down, brow furrowed, chewing her lip. Thinking.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: I was thinking they'd show after
dialog: breakup. You know...the thaw.
text: She stares off at the RIFLE in the corner, unseeing..
speaker_heading: MEDORA (CONT'D)
dialog: I would have killed the thing
dialog: myself, if I could have found it.
dialog: Goddamn demon. Goddamn murderer. I
dialog: tried to find it.
text: Core shakes his head gently, sets his tea down.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: The pack could be eight or ten
dialog: members. You don’t want to find
dialog: that.
text: They stare at each other a while, until Core notices
text: something, and she turns to see what he’s looking at...
text: THAT CRUDE WOLF MASK, forgotten there on the hearth.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
text: A shaman’s mask. Someone brought it
dialog: here.
dialog: (back to Core)
dialog: Can I ask you a personal question?
dialog: (off his nod)
dialog: Do you have a child?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CORE
text: A daughter. In Anchorage, she
dialog: teaches at the university.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: A teacher like her father.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I’m no teacher. Maybe I could have
dialog: been but...she’s good at it. She
dialog: wanted to be an Alaskan.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: That city’s not Alaska.
text: Something in her tone there, something dark.
speaker_heading: MEDORA (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Do you have any idea what’s out
dialog: those windows? How black it gets?
dialog: How that black gets into you? Let
dialog: me tell you Mr. Core, you’re not on
dialog: Earth here.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: (rattled by that)
dialog: But...this is your home.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: I was brought here when I was a
dialog: child, that makes me not from here.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: From where?
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: I don’t remember. I never asked.
dialog: (beat, out the window)
dialog: I don’t understand what they’re
dialog: doing here.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Wolves.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: They live here.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: (gesturing, this cabin)
dialog: But I don’t understand what they’re
dialog: doing here. Why is this happening
dialog: to me? Why now?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: They’re hungry, ma’am. No one’s
dialog: cursed. It’s just biology.
text: She leans back from his words. Insulted, perhaps.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sorry. I don’t know why this is
dialog: happening to you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Does your husband know yet?
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Men were supposed to call him. I
dialog: can’t tell him while he’s there.
dialog: He’1ll see what has happened when he
dialog: comes home, what we’ve done, what
dialog: no one was able to stop.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Why wouldn’t anyone hunt them after
dialog: what happened? You said...two other
dialog: children were...?
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: They're afraid. Or they think we
dialog: deserve it.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I don’t understand that.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Stay here a while. You might.
text: He struggles for the next thing to say. It takes him a bit.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: You’re not alone.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Yes, I am. Come, I’1ll show you
dialog: where the children were taken.
text: As she stands, she looks sourly at his feet...
speaker_heading: MEDORA (CONT'D)
dialog: Are those your only boots?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: These are what I have.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: You’1l need better boots.
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF KEELUT - DAY
text: CORE NOW WEARS THE HEAVY FUR-LINED BOOTS, tromping through
text: the snow with Medora, behind the village. Their crunching
text: footfalls are like a heartbeat. K-knch, k-knch, k-knch.
text: They pass by HEAVY EQUIPMENT kept behind cabins: overturned
text: canoes, gas augers to drill lake ice, shovels and chainsaws.
text: But hills and the forest sweep before them, eerily majestic.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: It’s beautiful.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: You don’t understand.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: But you're happy here? You were?
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: That’s not a question I ask myself.
dialog: I see pictures in magazines,
dialog: vacation pictures with sand and
dialog: girls in bathing suits. Seems so
dialog: strange to me.
dialog: (gesturing into the woods)
dialog: There’s a hot springs, not so far,
dialog: a few hours walking. That’s as
dialog: close as I can get to warmth.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: A hot spring sounds good right now.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: (absently)
dialog: Good place to get clean.
text: He wonders at her until nearing ENGINE NOISE prompts him to
dialog: look out at...
text: A WHITE-HAIRED YUP’IK MAN and his YOUNG BOY rumbling by on a
text: SNOWMOBILE in low gear, both with rifles, pulling a dead
text: MOOSE CALF on a sled.
text: Passing in a powdery swirl, they stare at Core.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: EXT. FROZEN POND - DAY
text: As Medora and Core crest a low rise and inch sideways down
dialog: towards the ice...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: You met your husband in this
dialog: village?
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: I never met him anywhere. I knew
dialog: him my whole life, I don’t have a
dialog: memory he isn’t in.
text: Something bitter comes into her voice, hissing almost--
speaker_heading: MEDORA (CONT'D)
dialog: And he left me here with a sick
dialog: child.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Well...the war.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Someone on the radio said it’s not
dialog: a real war.
speaker_heading: CORE
text: It’s real enough. People are dying.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: He said he’d never leave me. Words
dialog: can’t be worthless like that.
text: They stop there and she points out across the pond.
speaker_heading: MEDORA (CONT'D)
dialog: That's where the first boy was
dialog: taken.
text: OUT THERE, snowy wind skirls over the surface of the pond,
text: the WOODS beyond looming in shadow.
speaker_heading: MEDORA (CONT'D)
dialog: After that, they had men with
dialog: rifles on the high points. And they
dialog: walked the children to school. But
dialog: it didn’t matter for Bailey.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL HILL - DUSK
text: Medora and Core stand atop the hill as the day fades into
text: greyish half-light.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: The second was a girl, here.
text: Cheeon’s daughter. She was sledding
text: and the wolf came from behind her.
text: Core glances behind them, then up at the disappearing sun.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: From the North, again.
dialog: (back to her)
dialog: Does Cheeon live nearby?
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Yes. My husband’s friend.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Do you suppose I could speak with
dialog: him?
text: She makes a noise, an unhappy little snort.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: No. I don’t suppose you could.
dialog: So Core tries to move on from that...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Did uh...did Bailey like to sled?
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: No. He wasn’t the right one.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I’m...not sure what that means.
text: But it’s like she didn’t even hear him. Just staring out.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: You said he was sick?
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: He stopped going to school after my
dialog: husband left.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: That sounds normal.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: There was nothing normal about my
dialog: son.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I just meant...my daughter went
dialog: through that when she was Bailey's
dialog: age.
text: She flinches, looks away.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sorry. That’s not what--
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Stop apologizing to me.
dialog: (back to him)
dialog: How did it feel to shoot that
dialog: female wolf?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I had no choice. But it felt very
dialog: bad.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Even though she'd taken a child,
dialog: too?
dialog: (off his reluctant nod)
dialog: Because you think it’s the natural
dialog: order?
text: He chooses his words more carefully.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: They're not what you think, Mrs.
dialog: Slone. Wolves attacking people,
dialog: that’s not...what happened here
dialog: does not happen.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: What happened here happened to me.
text: She turns and trudges off.
text: He stands there a moment, looking down the hill where all
text: those sled tracks crisscross and interlace.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - NIGHT
text: Core sits by the stove, slurping the last of some hot soup,
text: mopping the bowl with fry bread. As he sets it aside...
text: Medora appears before him, hands him a CIGARETTE and MATCHES,
text: and then a CHOCOLATE BAR.
text: She watches as he lights the smoke, takes a drag, has a bite
text: of chocolate. Savoring all of it.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: (re: the cigarette)
dialog: I'd quit when my daughter was born
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Will she expect you home soon?

dialog: (sadly admitting)
dialog: I don’t know what she expects of me
dialog: these days.
text: She glances at the WEDDING BAND on his finger.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: What about your wife?
text: He seems to notice it for the first time. Smiles sadly.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: She's alright without me.
text: She considers him for a beat, and then...
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: I have a quilt and pillow for you.
dialog: I can see you're tired. I...I can’t
dialog: pay anything.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Oh, the chocolate’s fine.
text: But that intended deadpan humor was totally lost on her, she
text: just blinks at him. So he tries gentle sincerity instead--
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s not important.
text: She regards him curiously a moment and...
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Good night, Mr. Core.
text: He watches her drift away and close the bedroom door. Click.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - NIGHT, LATER
text: THE ELECTRIC HEATER ticks, glows infernal orange in the dark.
text: From somewhere else, a VOICE. Barely audible but...angry.
text: On the couch, curled under a heavy quilt, Core blinks awake.
dialog: What is that? He looks to--
dialog: 19.
text: THE BEDROOM DOOR, open just a crack, spilling light.
text: He gets up, crosses the room in his thermals, leans in so a
text: SLICE OF LIGHT falls over one eye as he sees--
text: INTO THE BEDROOM, where Medora sits in the STEAMING BATHTUB,
text: purposefully scrubbing her back with a hard brush. Her skin
text: is rubbed raw and she MUTTERS angry, unknowable words.
text: Ashamed, Core drops his eyes and backs away.
text: He returns to the couch, gets under the quilt and rolls over
text: to face away from the bedroom. But then...
text: He hears the DOOR open. Hears quiet FOOTSTEPS in the room.
text: Rolls back over to see...
text: MEDORA, glistening wet, naked by the window, tearing away the
text: plastic so the room now swells in ghastly blue moonlight.
text: She turns to face him. She has the WOLF MASK on her face.
text: He stares at her a long moment, terrified and heartbroken and
dialog: utterly unsure what to do.
text: She removes the mask, drops it carelessly. Goes to him. Pulls
text: the quilt back, slips under the covers, facing out.
text: He tries to give her space but there’s nowhere for him to go.
text: She pulls his arm over her, above the covers.
text: So he holds her like that, two spoons, unable to see the way
text: she stares out at the moonlight. Pleadingly?
text: It’s not sex, just warmth. But then, slowly, she guides his
text: HAND up to her THROAT...and holds it there. Tightly. Like
text: willing him to squeeze as her tears spill in silence.
text: Together, they gaze out the WINDOW...
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND THE SLONE CABIN - NIGHT
text: PULLING OUT from the WINDOW until we find...A MAN, very
text: still. Just standing there, a ways back from the cabin.
text: His cigarette flares, the brief glow revealing his face. It’s
text: the YUP’IK MAN we saw before, the tall one with the ponytail.
text: His name is CHEEON. Watching the cabin from the darkness.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: IN BLACKNESS, the faraway cracks of EXPLODING SHELLS and...
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROAD - IRAQ - DAY
text: A CITY BURNS IN THE DISTANCE. A horizon of jagged smoldering
text: teeth, great slow plumes of smoke climbing into the sky.
text: TILTING DOWN until the faceless face of A SOLDIER fills the
text: frame. In his goggles and dust mask he looks insectile,
text: alien, manning the .50 CAL TURRET atop a SPEEDING HUMVEE. The
text: whole world vibrates. VRRRRRRM.
text: UP AHEAD OF THEM, appearing for milliseconds then
text: disappearing again in gusts of road dust, a FLEEING PICKUP
text: TRUCK. Glimpses of head-wrapped FIGHTERS in the back.
text: The HUMVEE accelerates.
text: The SOLDIER sights along his .50.
text: UP AHEAD, the TRUCK swerves and fishtails, FLIPS AND ROLLS.
dialog: Surreal, because we can’t hear it happen, but we see BODIES
text: flying away from the tumbling wreck like dolls.
text: The HUMVEE screeches to a halt ten yards out. The overturned
text: TRUCK ignites into FLAMES. Doesn’t explode, just burns.
text: A BURNING MAN scrambles away from the wreck, waving his arms.
text: THE SOLDIER tracks him for a beat, two beats, and then--
text: BRAAAPT. THE .50 ROARS, chops the man down, cleaving limbs as
text: if with an invisible axe. TRACER ROUNDS like burning threads.
text: ANOTHER MAN staggers towards them out of the smoke, bleeding,
text: moaning soundlessly, wildly FIRING his Kalashnikov.
text: PING!PING! SHELLS RICOCHET off the Humvee, the SOLDIER
text: pivots, fires a prolonged blast. BRAAAAAAAAPT.
text: Destroys the man, sweeps the area, chews the truck, ends it.
text: In the ensuing smoke-swirling silence, a GRINNING CORPORAL
text: hops out of the Humvee, trots towards the spread of carnage.
text: The .50 Soldier lowers his mask, lifts his goggles to reveal
text: a pair of blank pale eyes. This is VERNON SLONE (27), lithe
text: and powerful, calmly lighting a cigarette as--
text: OUT THERE, the Corporal kneels over a child-sized BODY,
text: adjusting it, bringing something out of his pack...
text: Slone smokes. Watches.
text: OUT THERE, the Corporal takes a grinning selfie with his
text: CAMERA, flashing the peace sign, posing with the CORPSE.
dialog: 21.
text: Slone smokes. Watches.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - IRAQI CITY - DAY
text: Smoke. Rubble. Post-battle chaos. HEAVY ARMOR moving through.
text: Slone stalks along: helmet, body armor, M-4 CARBINE at low
dialog: ready.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: He turns down this narrow passage, alert, searching. He
text: pauses, like sensing the air. Hears something. Moves.
scene_heading: INT. BOMBED-OUT BUILDING - SAME
text: A soft WHIMPER and a GRUNT, some kind of STRUGGLE out of
text: focus in the foreground as Slone appears in the doorway.
text: That same CORPORAL has his pants down, thrusting himself into
text: an IRAQI WOMAN bent over a desk. Unh, unh, unh.
text: From across the room, the Woman makes terrified eye contact
text: with Slone, who has no reaction at all other than to briefly
dialog: double-check out the doorway and then--
text: BAM. Shoot the Corporal between the shoulder blades. He
text: spills off the Woman, gasping and bleeding on the floor.
text: The Woman scuttles back, more terrified now. Trapped.
text: Expressionless, Slone draws his KA-BAR KNIFE, steps forward.
text: She inhales to scream but...he holds out the KNIFE to her,
text: handle first. She’s astonished. Shaking, she takes it.
text: He tips his head towards the Corporal. Nods.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
text: TRACKING BACK with Slone as he walks calmly but briskly away.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET —- CONTINUOUS
text: TRACKING HIM as he returns to the churn of activity, VEHICLES
text: and SOLDIERS wiping the background. He keeps moving,
text: unperturbed, though the DIN of this place is suffocating.
text: STILL TRACKING HIM, a long shot, all the way down the block
text: as the NOISE builds to a feverish intensity until--
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: POP. ALL SOUND CUTS OUT AS A DIME-SIZED HOLE SUDDENLY APPEARS
text: IN SLONE’S NECK WITH A MIST OF RED.
text: We stay with him as he collapses, semi-conscious, bleeding.
text: IN THE BACKGROUND, we glimpse SOLDIERS FIRING at the unseen
text: sniper, OTHERS rushing up to Slone. All in total silence.
text: He just lays there, blinking glassily as we...
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
speaker_heading: BAILEY
text: Only a few frames of him, a wisp, staring at us with his
text: faintly blue skin.
speaker_heading: RESUME:
text: As the others roughly lift him out of frame, Slone seems to
dialog: be trying to say something.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER TARMAC - DAY
text: TIGHT ON SLONE as SOUND comes back, his eyes fluttering open,
text: his neck now THICKLY BANDAGED, dried blood in his blond hair.
text: A MEDIC is wheeling him on a STRETCHER, urgent and confused
text: activity all around, WIND and SHOUTING and HELICOPTER ROTORS.
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: (shouting over the noise)
dialog: Slone, you lucky fucker!
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: (a weak rasp)
dialog: ...B-Bailey?
speaker_heading: MEDIC
dialog: You'll see him soon, buddy! You're
dialog: going home!
text: The MEDIC thrusts Slone’s PAPERWORK to a harried TRANSPO
text: OFFICER as Slone is loaded into a waiting MEDICAL COPTER and
text: he’s already lapsing back into unconsciousness...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: IN BLACKNESS, a terrible RIPPING noise...
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - PRE-DAWN
text: Which is Medora pulling off a length of DUCT TAPE, which she
text: then wraps around the barrel of the AR-15.
text: Across the room, Core again pulls on SLONE’S HEAVY BOOTS.
text: Medora opens a duffel, unpacks a CARIBOU-HIDE SUIT: a thick
text: and heavy one-piece covering, like a hooded poncho.
text: She presents it to Core as weak light simmers outside.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK DOOR - SLONE CABIN - PRE-DAWN
text: Core steps outside in the caribou suit, a PACK and the AR-15
text: slung over his shoulders, SNOWSHOES on the big boots.
text: Behind him, Medora cinches her robe. A light dusting of SNOW
text: is falling. Core looks up at it, shudders...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: So much for ‘too cold to snow.’
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: What’s that mean?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Just something I heard.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: It’s never too cold to snow.
dialog: (glancing up)
dialog: There’s something wrong with the
dialog: sky.
text: He gives her a look, consults the COMPASS he’s holding in his
scene_heading: THICKLY-GLOVED HAND.
text: North, the needle shows.
text: He nods to her. She nods back. And...
text: From afar, we see Core trudge away from the cabin, towards
text: where that wolf came from, and Medora disappears back inside.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS AT THE EDGE OF KEELUT - DAWN
text: Core moves along, head down, making good time. But slowing as
text: he sees something ahead...
text: Glimpsed through a spiderweb of branches, a FIGURE and a
text: FIRE, some kind of SMALL HUT.
dialog: 24.
text: Closer, he realizes it’s ILLANAQ. She’s burning trash items
text: in an oil drum, another FIRELIGHT glowing inside her hut.
text: Drawing up to her, she speaks without looking at him...
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ
dialog: You know the name of this village?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Keelut.
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ
dialog: Say its meaning.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I don’t know its meaning.
text: Now she looks at him, that nasty teeth-missing grin.
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ
dialog: “Evil spirit disguised as dog. Or
dialog: wolf.”
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Why would they name it that?
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ
text: (shrugs, returns to her
dialog: work)
dialog: You’re the wolf expert, I hear.
text: Annoyed and discomfited, Core continues on past her. She
text: calls to his back...
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ (CONT'D)
dialog: That girl knows evil. She’1l tell
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: (without stopping or
dialog: turning back)
dialog: What that girl knows is grief. Have
dialog: a good day, ma’am.
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ
dialog: You're going the wrong way. Go back
dialog: the way you came.
text: He ignores her and she watches him fade into the woods.
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN WILDERNESS - DAY
text: VERY WIDE, Core is barely a speck out there, an ant scooting
text: across a dimension of white. Beautiful landscape, terrifying
dialog: in its vastness.
text: CLOSER, Core stomps through drifts, wearing GOGGLES now,
text: sinking slightly despite the snowshoes.
text: Winded, he pauses and turns in a full slow circle, taking in
text: this place, catching his breath.
text: He consults the compass and continues.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEPER INTO WILDERNESS - DAY
text: Core gulps thirstily from his thermos, drains it and then
text: packs snow in to refill it. He gnaws on some jerky.
text: He bends at the waist, stretching out his legs and back as
text: best he can before re-shouldering his pack and the rifle.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOT SPRING - DAY
text: A THICK MIST wafts across frame as Core enters this clearing,
text: his head tilting in confusion because...
text: The snow is all melted here, a circular area of wet bare
text: ground that radiates from a HILLSIDE CAVE up ahead, the mouth
text: of which issues a steady trickle of STEAM.
text: That momentary stutter in his stride must be him recognizing
text: this place from Medora’s words. He approaches...
scene_heading: INT. THE HOT SPRING - SAME
dialog: And from deep within this steamy slick-walled darkness, we
text: see Core’s silhouette bend into view, peering in. His heavy
text: breathing echoes, mixes with a steady drip-drip-dripping.
text: He glances down, sees...
text: A HARD WHITE SUBSTANCE, frozen in rivulets through the cracks
dialog: of the cave floor. Is that wax?
text: He wonders at this a moment...and continues on his way.
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP HILLY WOODS - DAY
text: Core walks slow, face flushed, ice crusting his beard. His
text: breath billows raggedly. He scans the forest floor...
text: But the snowy surface is perfectly unbroken. No tracks.
text: Even behind the goggles, he looks discouraged. He continues.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY BLUFF - DAY
text: THE SUN shrieks down, directly overhead. Core shuffles into
text: view, stoop-shouldered, exhausted.
text: He clambers awkwardly to a low exposed boulder and
text: sits/collapses. Gulps deep breaths and slips off his pack and
text: rifle, raises the goggles.
text: He rests, bent forward, eyes shut. Wincing. We hold on hima
text: long beat as his breathing slowly settles until...
text: A HOWL. His eyes snap open. He straightens, looks over his
text: shoulder. It was faint but unmistakable: wolves.
scene_heading: EXT. RIDGE OVER A SNOWY PLAIN - DAY
text: CORE’S FACE inches over the crest, wide-eyed, looking out at--
text: THE SNOWY PLAIN spreading before him after the STEEP DROP-OFF
text: directly below: a great, dead valley floor.
text: And far out there, strange against the frozen stillness of it
text: all, there are TINY MOVING SHAPES.
text: He puts his FIELD GLASSES to his eyes and...
text: CORE’S BINOCULAR POV shows a PACK OF SNARLING GREY WOLVES,
text: six or eight, hackles up, hard to say exactly how many the
text: way they’re darting and thrashing around something.
text: Core crawls to a better vantage point and looks again. (And
dialog: was that a flash of actual excitement in his eyes?)
text: CORE’S BINOCULAR POV now shows a better angle of the WOLVES,
text: the pink fur around their mouths...and the WOLF PUP CARCASS
text: they're fighting over, ripping apart, gobbling down.
text: With the field glasses still to his eyes, we can see in
text: Core’s mouth how whatever excitement he felt turns sour.
text: He lowers the glasses, holds there, looking off as the
text: BARKING and HOWLING of the wolves come echoing in.
dialog: 27.
text: And finally, he looks away and begins to scoot back the way
dialog: he came except--
text: KUNCH. THE ICY BLUFF CRACKS FREE AND CORE TUMBLES DOWN THE
text: STEEP DROP-OFF. Rolling over and over, uncontrolled in a
text: whorl of powdery whiteness.
dialog: 
text: HE LANDS HARD WITH AN INVOLUNTARY CRY OF PAIN--
speaker_heading: CORE
speaker_heading: UHH!
text: AND FAR OUT ON THE PLAIN, the ALPHA WOLF hears that. Looks
text: back towards the ridge, tall ears straightening.
text: AT THE BASE OF THE DROP-OFF, Core struggles up out of the
text: snow, GRUNTING painfully, battered. And quickly realizing...
text: He's lost the AR-15. He swats at his shoulders but it’s gone.
text: He looks all around him in the tufts of disturbed snow made
dialog: by his fall. Oh Jesus, where is it? And then...
text: A STRONG GUST OF WIND BLOWS FROM BEHIND CORE, ruffling the
text: fur on his hood, gusting the SNOW about him--
text: WHICH WE FOLLOW AS IT SPEEDS OUT ACROSS THE PLAIN. We are the
dialog: wind and we’re blowing right up to--
text: THE WOLVES, the rest of which all look in the same direction
text: as the Alpha, back towards Core. Their noses twitch and a low
text: collective GROWL rumbles from the pack.
text: ON CORE, even three hundred feet away he’s able to tell that
text: the Wolves have stopped feasting and are now clocking him.
text: He stares out at them, frozen in rapidly mounting fear.
text: THE ALPHA GROWLS, long teeth exposed, eyes wild and fixed.
text: CORE catches something in his periphery, look--
text: THE AR-15, jammed into the snow barrel-first, ten feet away.
text: This moment: Core and the Pack facing each other over the
text: plain. No motion. No sound but their soft GROWLS in the wind.
text: CORE LUNGES, clawing through snow for the rifle.
text: THE PACK CHARGES, bounding at him with the force of rockets.
text: BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE PLAIN, that speck on the left is Core,
text: the cluster rapidly approaching from the right are Wolves.
dialog: 28.
text: CORE snags the rifle, jerks it out, tugs at the DUCT TAPE
text: around the barrel but his bulky GLOVES make it impossible.
text: THE WOLVES, charging in, snouts low, huge paws churning snow.
text: CORE sees this, frantically gnaws a glove off and pulls the
text: duct tape loose bare-handed.
text: IN THE DISTANCE, the Wolves are quickly growing larger. A
text: hundred fifty feet away, a hundred now and--
text: CORE shoulders the rifle, his one bare hand already numbed
dialog: with cold, shaking it out--
text: BIRD'S EYE VIEW as the Wolves fan out into a C-shape, closing
text: on Core. They're going to encircle him.
text: CORE shakes his numb hand and sights though--
text: THE RIFLE SCOPE, where the Alpha is gigantic but the
dialog: CROSSHAIRS jump and jerk--
text: CORE lowers the rifle, inhales to steady himself as we--
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
speaker_heading: CORE’S DRIPPING HAND
text: In the bathtub the other night, hovering over that razor.
speaker_heading: RESUME:
text: CORE keeps the rifle down, eyes off, deciding something.
text: THE WOLVES are so very close now.
text: BIRD’S EYE VIEW as that C-shape nearly surrounds Core.
text: CORE lifts the rifle and his manner can only be described as
text: regretful as he sights though--
text: THE RIFLE SCOPE, where the Alpha is seemingly right there.
text: HIS FINGER tightens on the trigger.
text: THE ALPHA snarls and slavers, almost close enough to leap.
text: At the last second CORE LIFTS THE RIFLE SLIGHTLY--
text: IN THE SCOPE THE CROSSHAIRS MOVE OFF THE ALPHA AND--
scene_heading: CORE FIRES. BAM.
dialog: 29.
text: THE ALPHA JERKS TO A HALT, stymied by the sudden report.
text: BIRD'S EYE VIEW as the C-shape of wolves slows, stops.
scene_heading: CORE AIMS OFF AND FIRES AGAIN. BAM.
text: THE ALPHA JERKS BACK AS THE BULLET PUNCHES THE SNOW. Pft.
text: CORE shivers in place.
text: BIRD'S EYE VIEW as the C-shape of wolves disintegrates and
text: spreads away from him.
text: CORE keeps the rifle up, watching down its barrel.
text: THE ALPHA gives a last uncertain look his way before trotting
text: off. The rest of the PACK follows.
text: CORE slowly lowers the rifle, watching them go, stupefied,
text: his eyes swimming.
text: WIDE ON CORE, very small out there, hunched, alone.
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN WILDERNESS - DAY, MUCH LATER
text: THE SUN is sinking, bruising the sky.
text: WIDE ON CORE, returning slowly over familiar landscape.
text: CLOSER ON CORE, deeply fatigued, finishing his thermos as he
text: treks onward.
text: He’s following his own tracks back the way he came, weaving
text: along parallel to them. He looks absolutely bereft.
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF KEELUT - DUSK
text: Core returns in gloom. The buildings of Keelut glow weakly
text: ahead. His eyes are downcast, snowshoes crunching dolorously.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - NIGHT
text: Core enters through the back, half-stumbling in and then
text: leaning his whole weight on the door to close it again.
text: He drops the pack, sets the rifle down, sits before the
text: fireplace full of dying embers and removes the snowshoes,
text: wriggles out of the caribou suit.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Mrs. Slone.
dialog: 30.
text: He sits there a moment, breathing the warm air, returning to
text: himself. But she doesn’t respond.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: Mrs. Slone?
text: Silence. Something feels wrong.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SLONE CABIN - SAME
text: Creeak. Core pushes the door open with a fingertip, peeks in.
text: DRAWERS have been dumped out, most of the clothes gone. The
text: shallow WARDROBE is open, empty hangers inside.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - SAME
text: Core comes back into the main room, wondering, when he sees--—
text: THE CLOSET DOOR, with the PADLOCK unlocked and dangling from
dialog: the hasp.
text: He opens it...not a closet at all but in fact a ROOT CELLAR,
text: with steep earthen steps leading down into harsh pale light.
scene_heading: INT. ROOT CELLAR - SAME
text: A SINGLE BARE BULB dangles from the low ceiling.
text: Core comes carefully down the steps, stooped to keep from
text: bumping his head, taking in the space:
text: Wooden crates. Mason jars of dried foods. Lumber, visqueen,
text: rodent droppings on the floor.
text: And something else. Core stares at it, his breath fogging out
text: of him as a confused kind of horror pools on his face.
text: He steps forward.
text: Tucked upright into a shadowy nook, there is some kind of
text: PLASTIC-WRAPPED COCOON. He seems to already know what it is.
dialog: It’s Bailey.
text: Core folds the plastic back to see his face. Frozen, blue,
text: mouth ajar as if to inhale, eyes half-lidded and iced over.
text: Core wants to scream but doesn’t know how.
dialog: 31.
text: As gently as he can, he removes the plastic-wrapped bundle of
text: the boy’s body and lays it on the floor of the cellar.
text: He finds a FOLDED BLANKET and carefully covers Bailey up.
text: He sits on a crate beside it and weeps.
scene_heading: EXT. KEELUT - NIGHT
text: Core stumbles down the main road, hollering left and right.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: HELP! HELP ME! HELP, PLEASE!
text: On either side, he sees curtains draw back in CABIN WINDOWS
text: and SHADOWY FORMS appear there, looking out at him.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: PLEASE! THE SLONE BOY!
text: Up ahead, PEOPLE are emerging from their homes, trickling
text: suspiciously into the road.
text: A VILLAGER comes jogging up to him, glaring in alarm, a rifle
text: in one hand, shrugging into his coat. It’s Cheeon.
text: Core gestures wildly back over his shoulder--
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
scene_heading: BAILEY SLONE.
text: --and Cheeon sprints past him, up towards the Slone cabin.
text: Core sways in the road, dizzied, looking at the VILLAGERS.
text: Some are Yup’ik, some are white, some mixed. Odd clashing
text: clothes: animal hide mukluks and NFL jackets, like that.
text: None of them say a word, none of them betray any emotion.
text: Core just stands there shaking his head until he notices...
text: ILLANAQ, at the rear of the crowd. He points at her...
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Y-you knew, didn't you?
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ
dialog: How could an old woman know?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: How could you not say anything?
text: Under her breath, as she turns and hobbles away...
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ
dialog: Go away. Leave us to the devils.
text: He watches her go as OTHER VILLAGERS brush past him, up
text: towards the cabin. Aching and cold, he follows.
scene_heading: INT. ROOT CELLAR - NIGHT
text: Cheeon is kneeling over Bailey’s body, looking down on him
text: with a simultaneous expression of rage and boredom. There’s a
text: DARK BRUISE visible on the boy’s throat, encircling it.
text: He replaces the blanket, stands (having to stoop low, tall as
text: he is) to face the Villagers and Core waiting behind him.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: Where is Medora Slone?
text: Nobody answers. Cheeon points at Core, specifically.
speaker_heading: CHEEON (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is she?
text: Core shakes his head, helpless, and Cheeon snaps a command--
speaker_heading: CHEEON (CONT'D)
dialog: [Yup’ik words]
text: --to a YUP’IK TEENAGER who dutifully sprints away up the
text: stairs. Cheeon glares at Core a beat, then pushes past him.
text: Some Villagers pause to say SOFT YUP’IK WORDS over the body,
text: then they all file away as well, leaving Core there.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - NIGHT
text: They’d left the front door open when they departed. Core
text: emerges from the cellar and closes it again. He stands there,
dialog: unsure what to do...
text: He goes to the fire, adds some logs, stokes it back to life.
text: Sinks onto the couch like an old building collapsing.
text: He tips his head back...allows his eyes to close...
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - NIGHT, AN HOUR LATER
text: Core jerks awake to HUSHED VOICES. There are people here.
dialog: 33.
text: TWO WHITE MEN stand by the cellar door, looking askance at
text: him in their heavy coats and hunter’s caps. They have
text: Sheriff's badges: a FAT DEPUTY and a YOUNG DEPUTY.
text: And now a THIRD MAN emerges from the cellar, running a tired
text: hand over his face. Buzz cut, pale skin: his name is
scene_heading: DETECTIVE DONALD MARIUM (43).
text: He says something inaudible to his Deputies and then makes a
text: kind of sympathetic eye contact with Core across the room.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - LATER
text: Marium has pulled up the chair to sit across from Core, both
text: have coffee but neither one is drinking.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Why did she ask you here?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I don’t know. She’d read my book on
dialog: wolves.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: And you decided to come, why?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: To help. She said wolves had taken
dialog: children and no one would help.
dialog: Here, see...?
text: He thrusts out MEDORA’S LETTER, almost begging. As Marium
text: unfolds and reads it, the two Deputies re-enter the cabin
text: with a black VINYL BAG and descend into the cellar.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Well...no wolf took Bailey.
dialog: (re-folding the letter)
dialog: I need to keep this, okay?
dialog: Core gestures, sure.
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: What’d you do out there?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I looked for the wolves.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Uh huh. Did you see them?
text: Core nods, his mind far away.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: What’d you do?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: Nothing.
text: After a moment, Core seems to return, blinks at Marium.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: Are the others coming?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Others?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Investigators. Shouldn’t there be
dialog: more investigators?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: It’s not like TV here. It’s just
dialog: us. We don’t have full membership
dialog: with the rest of the world and
dialog: mostly we like it that way.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Is it midnight yet?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: It’s six p.m.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: That can’t be, it...it was dark
dialog: when I returned--

dialog: That was three-thirty p.m. Dawn is
dialog: at ten a.m. now, you’re not
dialog: acclimated.
text: Core shakes his head, looking off, confused and brittle.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: (softly)
text: She strangled him.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Someone did.
speaker_heading: CORE
text: It was her. Her truck is gone. She
dialog: packed. She left me here to find
dialog: him.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Why would she do that?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: (abruptly furious)
dialog: “Why? Why?!” You're the police!
text: Marium waits as Core settles down, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: I apologize.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: No need.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I uh...I put a blanket on him.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: We'll take good care of Bailey.
dialog: Don’t you worry about that.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Someone has to tell the father.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: We’ve sent word.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: You know him?
text: Marium nods slowly, his jaw becoming very tight.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: If you’re from around here, you
dialog: know Vernon Slone.
text: Soft SCUFFING sounds behind them. Core looks...
text: The Deputies are bringing the BODY BAG out of the cellar.
scene_heading: INT. QUICK DOG MOTEL - “IN TOWN” - NIGHT
text: MARIUM’S TRUCK pulls up to this grey rectangular slab, aglow
text: in sodium-yellow light, leading CORE’S SUV in to park.
text: Core gets out of his vehicle, pausing there as Marium lowers
text: his window, passes him an OFFICIAL FORM from a clipboard.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: You'll need to stay a few days, at
dialog: least.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll probably have more questions
dialog: and I'll need this statement from
dialog: you. Just use your own words, short
dialog: and sweet. Clete in there’s a
dialog: notary.
text: Core nods in tired acceptance and as he turns away...
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: You're sure she did this, but tell
dialog: me how.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: With a rope. I don’t know.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Not how she did it, how you know
dialog: she did it.
text: Core squints at Marium, suddenly alert.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Do you suspect me?
dialog: Marium gives a diplomatic smile/frown, Nah, relax.
text: But Core does not relax. He stares out into the night, then
text: at the statement form in his hand, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: You asked me before about the
dialog: wolves. When I encountered them,
text: they were in the act of devouring
dialog: one of their own. Just a pup. It’s
dialog: not uncommon at all.
text: At this, Marium seems to frost over.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: In certain animal populations, when
dialog: resources are scarce, when there is
dialog: unnatural stress, some of the young
dialog: may be killed off to preserve the
dialog: group. The behavioral term for this
text: is ‘savaging.’
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: We're not talking about animals,
dialog: Mr. Core.
text: Core shrugs, carelessly...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: If you say so.
dialog: 37.
text: A beat, the two men facing each other in the lot.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Okay. Get some rest now...
text: As Core turns away and Marium puts the truck in gear...
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: .»-maybe a hot bath or something.
dialog: Get the chill off.
text: He watches Core trudge stoop-shouldered into the motel
text: without looking back.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: IN BLACKNESS, a gurgling WHITE NOISE builds...
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: A PAIR OF WELL-WORN HIKING BOOTS sit on a leafy, brown forest
text: floor. No snow? Next to them, a PAIR OF KID’S BOOTS.
text: Leaning against a tree, a .30-06 REMINGTON RIFLE, and beside
text: it, a LIGHTWEIGHT .22.
text: TWO PAIRS OF BARE FEET dangle in a SHALLOW CREEK. That’s the
text: gurgling we hear.
text: It’s Vernon Slone: healthy, uninjured, smoking. Beside him,
text: eating a cold egg sandwich in wax paper, is Bailey. So this
text: is some other time. Their conversation is full of pauses...
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: (re: the creek)
dialog: It’s cold.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: Mama said you’re going away.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: You remember what deployment means?
dialog: (off Bailey's frown)
dialog: It means work. It means money for
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: For my birthday I’1l be seven.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: I know. I'll be home when you’re
dialog: seven and a half.
text: Slone gestures and Bailey looks off at...
text: THE DEAD FAWN on the bank, a fresh bullet hole in her neck.
speaker_heading: SLONE (CONT'D)
dialog: How did that feel?
text: Bailey stares at the fawn, glassily. Emptily, even. His
dialog: answer is soft...
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: It felt real good.
text: But then the boy’s brow furrows...
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: You killed a person before.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: Mama.
text: Slone doesn’t respond to that, just waits for more.
speaker_heading: BAILEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Who did you kill?
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: A man who would hurt Mama and you.
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: But he didn’t hurt us?
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: No. I hurt him first.
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: My teacher said it’s bad to kill
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: You'll hear that a lot.
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: So...it’s good?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: If you have to.
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: To protect what you love and what
dialog: you need.
text: Bailey considers these words seriously, then returns to his
text: sandwich. As Slone reaches out to touch the boy’s hair...
speaker_heading: SLONE (CONT'D)
dialog: When I go away...I’1ll always be
dialog: with you. Do you understand that?
speaker_heading: BAILEY
dialog: (not unkindly)
dialog: Don’t lie.
text: a miniscule twitch which on him reads
text: Slone smiles at that,
text: like a klieg light. As a SNAPPING noise builds we..
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MILITARY HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: It’s a flustered MILITARY DOCTOR flipping through pages on
text: his clipboard, looking for some answer and not finding it.
speaker_heading: MILITARY DOCTOR
dialog: I’m sorry. You should have been
dialog: told before.
text: Slone sits on the bed in his civvies in this bright clean
text: room. His neck is NEWLY BANDAGED. He’s gaunt, pale, staring
text: at the Doctor the way one stares at a leak in the ceiling.
speaker_heading: MILITARY DOCTOR (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: We have an SFAC rep coming over. Or
dialog: if you'd prefer clergy...
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: Slone walks quickly, robotically, eyes dead ahead. No
text: expression. No baggage. Hands thrust into his coat pockets.
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM - AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: Cheeon stands next to the baggage carousel, himself
text: resembling the Keelut totem pole.
text: Slone approaches and, by way of a greeting, Cheeon hands him
text: a SHEATHED BOWIE KNIFE, which Slone tucks under his coat at
text: the small of his back. No words, no handshake...
text: They just continue on towards the exit, side by side.
scene_heading: INT. CHEEON’S TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT
text: The RADIO plays an upbeat country number and Cheeon drives
text: them out of the AIRPORT PARKING LOT as Slone cracks the
text: window, lights a cigarette, stares out at the darkness.
scene_heading: INT. BREAK ROOM - MORGUE - NIGHT
text: A NOVELTY PAINTING of a moose wearing red lipstick and a
dialog: Marilyn Monroe wig.
text: Cheeon stares at this as if pondering a calculus equation.
text: Slone sits at the table, smoking, staring blankly at--
text: Russell Core, who sits slouched in the corner, unable to meet
text: Slone’s gaze, dabbing his runny nose with a tissue.
text: It’s a little drop-ceiling room: hard furniture, coffee and
text: stale donuts on the counter. After a quiet beat...
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Are those my boots?
text: Core looks down, swallows as he remembers that they are.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: You’re the one found my boy?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Yes.
text: Slone exhales smoke, stubs the cigarette out, nods slowly.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: Core doesn’t know how to respond.
dialog: 41.
text: Marium and the two Deputies enter: all three, to varying
text: degrees, are visibly nervous in Slone’s presence.
speaker_heading: FAT DEPUTY
dialog: We got leads, Vern. Got her picture
dialog: out, been in touch with the
dialog: Mounties, we're coordinating. We’re
dialog: gonna find her. She’ll answer for
dialog: it.
text: Marium shoots the Deputy a look, Cool it.
text: Cheeon looks from them to Slone, who listens to all this
dialog: without expression.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Vernon. You have my--all of our
dialog: deepest condolences. This is...I
dialog: can’t even imagine.
text: Slone nods in acceptance, lights a new smoke. Marium clears
dialog: his throat.
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Core was called here by your
dialog: wife. He was the last one to see
dialog: her and he’s been very helpful to
dialog: us so far. We asked him to be here
dialog: in case you had questions for him.
text: Cheeon looks at Core. Slone looks at Core. Eventually...
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Can you raise the dead?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Then I have no questions for you.
text: Core looks away. Everyone except Slone and Cheeon shifts
dialog: uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Can you think of anyone she might
dialog: run to? Relatives? A friend?
dialog: Anything at all?
text: Slone pulls a long drag, really thinking...but finally has to
text: shake his head No. And then he looks up at Marium..
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Now?
dialog: 42.
text: Marium’s face clouds over.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Alright.
scene_heading: INT. “COLD ROOM” - MORGUE - NIGHT
text: Slone approaches the steel table with a sheet-covered
text: something resting atop it in a bright pool of light. His face
text: is ever impassive...but he’s breathing faster than usual.
text: Marium and the two Deputies stand back by the door.
text: The CORONER waits for a subtle look from Marium and then
text: draws back the sheet.
text: We don’t need to see Bailey. We hold on Slone’s face. We can
text: hear his breath rattle inside his nose. We can see the tight
text: clench of his jaw.
text: In time, he’1l begin to sob.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MORGUE - NIGHT
text: Core is waiting outside on the church-pew bench when, from
text: inside the DOUBLE DOORS marked Restricted, comes a SCREAM so
text: anguished and bitter it barely sounds human.
text: It startles him out of near-sleep and he blinks fearfully at
text: the doors, then looks over at...
text: Cheeon, who is leaning against the wall, looking at him.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - MORGUE - NIGHT
text: Slone, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand, comes out
text: of the REAR ENTRANCE with Cheeon. The two Deputies, Core, and
text: finally Marium follow close behind.
text: They cluster by CHEEON’S TRUCK, waiting as Slone gulps some
text: fresh air, collects himself, looking up at the stars.
text: Marium approaches.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I’m sorry, Vernon. We’ll keep you
dialog: informed. It’s a state-wide all
dialog: points, so...it’ll be over soon.
text: Slone just stares at him.
dialog: 43.
text: Marium extends his hand. Slone looks down at it, dead-eyed,
text: and finally takes it for a perfunctory shake.
text: Core has turned away from this, is already heading off
text: toward’s MARIUM’S TRUCK when...
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Wolf Man.
text: Core stops, looks back. Slone steps forward. Core watches
text: him, unsure of what’s coming...
text: Slone extends his hand to him. Core hesitates, takes it, able
text: to look the taller man in the eye but only barely.
text: Marium notes the moment and, with that, he and Core get into
text: his truck and pull away. Once they’re out of sight...
text: The Fat Deputy produces a FLASK, drinks and offers it to
text: Slone, who drinks, and passes it on to Cheeon...
speaker_heading: FAT DEPUTY
dialog: Fucking thing like this. Can you
dialog: figure her mind? Jesus God.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DEPUTY
dialog: You know, uh, I read post-partum
dialog: can go on for years sometimes.
speaker_heading: FAT DEPUTY
dialog: Shut the fuck up, Mike.
text: (as Cheeon passes him the
dialog: flask back)
dialog: Don’t worry, Vern. We’ll get her, I
dialog: promise you that.
text: Very casually, Cheeon brings out a .45 AUTO, hands it to
text: Slone, and SLONE SHOOTS THE FAT DEPUTY IN THE FACE. BAM.
speaker_heading: YOUNG DEPUTY
dialog: Don' t--
text: SLONE SHOOTS THE YOUNG DEPUTY IN THE FACE. BAM.
text: As Cheeon unlocks and opens the bed of his TRUCK, Slone
text: SHOOTS EACH OF THE FALLEN MEN EACH ONCE MORE. BAM, BAM.
text: As Cheeon starts the engine, Slone walks back towards the
text: REAR ENTRANCE with that smoking pistol in his fist.
dialog: 44,
scene_heading: INT. MARIUM’S TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT
text: The WIND whistles outside the cab, some bluesy classic rock
text: on the RADIO. But even so, Marium glances briefly in the
dialog: rearview. Did I hear something back there?
text: He turns the RADIO down, frowning into the rearview. But it’s
text: just black silence out there now.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Nothing.
text: Core coughs, dabs his nose. Looks like shit. Marium notices.
text: A NEW SONG begins and Core reaches for the radio dial...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Do you mind?
dialog: ...-turns it back up when Marium shrugs, Go ahead.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: I like this one.
text: Marium drives on, listening to the song.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Me too.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAPPING ROAD - NIGHT
text: Pitch-blackness is split by HEADLIGHTS crawling towards us,
text: revealing this hidden pass through thick woods.
text: CHEEON’S TRUCK jerks to a halt, splashing its LIGHTS onto a
text: MASSIVE ICY DRIFT. Slone and Cheeon hop out, moving fast.
text: A PICK AXE and a SHOVEL are yanked out. CHOPPING into the ICY
text: HILL in a tight, steady rhythm--kak, kak, kak, kak--until a
text: SHALLOW SLOT is cleared.
text: Cheeon shoulders a RECTANGULAR WOODEN BOX from the truck bed,
text: plain but expertly crafted, and fits it into the slot.
text: And then Slone moves to the truck, slowing as he bends to
scene_heading: remove BAILEY’S BLANKET-WRAPPED BODY.
text: He lays him gently inside the BOX, folds the blanket back,
text: removes his glove...and lays his hand on Bailey for a moment.
dialog: 45.
text: He replaces the blanket and turns away, blasted white in the
text: HEADLIGHTS as he moves back towards the truck while Cheeon,
text: in the background, power drills a lid onto the box. VZZ2Z22!
scene_heading: EXT. KEELUT - NIGHT
text: CHEEON’S TRUCK glides through Keelut like a black shark.
text: A FACE in a cabin peers at them passing, quickly looks away.
scene_heading: INT. CHEEON’S TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT
text: Cheeon pulls up to the end of the road, to the Slone Cabin,
text: throws it in park and passes Slone a SET OF KEYS.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
text: Heat shed behind the school.
text: Registered to a cousin. Full tank.
dialog: If you gotta go to ground, Shan’s
dialog: still got his place.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: I won't.
text: They clasp hands, eyes locked, and share a tiny nod. This is
text: communion. But just before Slone pops the door...
speaker_heading: SLONE (CONT'D)
dialog: I am sorry about Alasie.
text: Cheeon blinks once but otherwise might as well be stone.
speaker_heading: SLONE (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s not right you don’t have her
dialog: body.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: Right’s got nothing to do with
dialog: anything. You know this.
dialog: Yes, Slone does know this.
scene_heading: EXT. SLONE CABIN - NIGHT
text: THE FRONT DOOR is sealed with an X of yellow police tape and
text: Slone passes by, circling back to--
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE CABIN - NIGHT
text: THE REAR DOOR where he enters, another wad of police tape in
text: his hand. He moves in a sure but unhurried way. We follow
text: him, catching fast glimpses of what he does. Time is broken.
text: INSTANT COFFEE, boiling water going into a mug.
text: A SANDWICH, hard bread and cold cuts slapped together, Slone
text: chewing mechanically, gulping coffee.
text: IN THE BEDROOM MIRROR he peels off his bandage and applies
text: antiseptic cream to his HEALING GUNSHOT WOUND.
text: A CUPBOARD is opened and Slone (now with a fresh bandage on
text: his neck) retrieves a 9MM HANDGUN and BOX OF AMMO.
text: A DUFFEL BAG is opened and the 9MM, a 12 GAUGE AUTOLOADER, a
text: REMINGTON RIFLE, the AR-15 and VARIOUS AMMO go inside.
text: THE COMPOUND BOW is grabbed, a QUIVER of arrows.
text: FROM A FOOTLOCKER, socks, leggings, Maglite, binoculars.
text: FROM A DRAWER, a POLAROID PHOTO: Medora, posed on the edge of
text: a river in hiking gear, smiling awkwardly.
text: A WICKER BASKET, pawing inside it until he brings back a pair
text: of MEDORA’S UNDERWEAR. He inhales them, precisely.
text: And then sees something else, bends to get it...one of
text: BAILEY’S LITTLE T-SHIRTS. His hand closes tightly on it.
scene_heading: EXT. ILLANAQ’S HUT - NIGHT
text: ILLANAQ waits before her hut, FIRELIGHT crackling behind her
text: for a semi-silhouette. She sees something and shuffles back
dialog: inside because...
text: Slone is coming this way, inexorably, through the snow.
scene_heading: INT. ILLANAQ’S HUT - SAME
text: Illanagq sits by her fireplace, a halved oil drum turned on
text: its side. Pelts, cordwood, leather-bound books as furniture.
text: She holds a faceless HEX DOLL for comfort.
text: THE WIND stirs sparks and then Slone is sitting across from
text: her, firelight gleaming on the blade of his Bowie knife.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ
dialog: You come to punish the old witch,
dialog: Vernon Slone? I’m no witch. You
dialog: think I knew? You think I could
dialog: have stopped her? An old woman?
text: Slone says nothing. She spits on her own floor, smirks.
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ (CONT'D)
dialog: Go to your father’s grave and ask
dialog: him. Take your wrath to the gods,
dialog: to the wolves. To yourself and end
dialog: it.
text: Slone says nothing. She rattles the hex doll at him, as if to
text: scold him.
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ (CONT'D)
dialog: That boy’s fate was foretold in the
dialog: ice. So was hers. And yours. You
dialog: should have died there in the sand
dialog: but you did not accept that. You
dialog: came home to see.
text: Slone says nothing. She shifts, growing less sure, less
text: haughty. She reaches for a PILL BOTTLE, swallows one dry.
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ (CONT'D)
dialog: This is not the first time the
dialog: wolves came. Before, the white men
dialog: called it influenza. We called it
dialog: peelak. I was a little girl. Half
text: the village, their bodies in igloos
dialog: on the hill, for proper burial
dialog: after breakup. I pulled them there
dialog: on my father’s sled. But the wolves
dialog: came at night and broke the igloos.
dialog: In the morning, the hillside was
text: scattered with the pieces of their
dialog: bodies. There is no proper burial
dialog: after that. That is our history
dialog: here.
text: Slone says nothing. She pleads in a whisper...
speaker_heading: ILLANAQ (CONT'D)
dialog: You cannot blame an old woman for
dialog: it.
text: Slone rises, his body filling the smoky space of the hut.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP WOODS - NIGHT
text: A 4x4 is tucked into this dark, hidden turnaround, lights off
text: but its ENGINE idling, exhaust smoke swirling around it...
scene_heading: INT. 4X4 - SAME
text: Vernon is curled inside it under many quilts, eyes shut tight
text: with BAILEY’S SHIRT clamped over his nose, breathing it in.
text: Even with the heat on, his breath fogs.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: TEACHING ASSISTANT (PHONE V.O.)

dialog: One moment.
text: THE SIDE TABLE is cluttered with snotty tissues, half-empty
text: NyQuil, paper cups of cold tea. A half-eaten chocolate bar.
text: We can hear the crackly HOLD MUSIC over the phone line.
text: AN OFFICIAL POLICE FORM, ‘Statement of Witness’, blank except
text: for Core’s contact information, lays on the chair with a pen.
dialog: The hold music cuts and--
speaker_heading: TEACHING ASSISTANT (PHONE V.O.)
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, she's not available, may
dialog: I take a message?
speaker_heading: CORE (0.S.)
dialog: (quiet defeat)
dialog: No, thank you.
dialog: 49.
dialog: Click.
text: Core lays curled and sweaty in bed, gazing at the television.
text: Fearfully hypnotized. He coughs softly, rolls away from it...
text: CLOSE ON CORE as he stares straight ahead at something else,
text: something in near focus. His expression remains the same.
text: CLOSE ON CORE’S WIFE, curled beside him, her frozen-moan face
text: only inches away from his.
text: CLOSE ON CORE, staring at her, his face tightening with some
dialog: impossible question.
text: CLOSE ON MEDORA, who is now the one curled beside him,
text: looking back at him with a plain, answering kind of look.
text: HIGH SHOT, looking down on Core in bed, tangled in the
text: thrashed-up sheets. He is, of course, all alone here.
text: A long beat like that, and then...
text: He pushes himself up, reaches for the police form and pen.
dialog: A FLASH OF THE FORM: ‘...is true to the best of my
text: knowledge,’ with a space for writing below.
text: He considers this, vexed, like it’s a foreign language. And
text: then, as if on autopilot, slowly at first...
text: He begins to write, hunched there on the bed.
text: FLASHES OF HIS HANDWRITING: MEDORA SLONE... LETTER... TO KEELUT...
text: His scribbling intensifies, the pen SCRAPING on the form.
text: FLASHES OF WRITING: ATIRIBUTED TO WOLVES... HIKED NORTH / NORTHWEST...
text: And intensifies further, hard SLASHING pen strokes.
scene_heading: FLASHES OF WRITING: EMPTY HOUSE... BODY ( BAILEY SLONE )... ALERTED
text: NEIGHBORS...
text: And intensifies further still, growing almost violent until--
text: He stops. Stares curiously at the page for a long beat.
text: A FLASH OF HIS WRITING: ELDERLY WOMAN
text: He stands abruptly, is momentarily dizzied and has to steady
text: himself before he can grab and dial the phone.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: Police operator, what's your
dialog: emergency?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I-- no, I don’t have an emergency,
dialog: it’s...I need to speak with the
dialog: Sheriff's station, please.
text: As the line goes silent without another word...
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: Hello?
text: A RINGING is followed by a NEW VOICE, noticeably tense--
speaker_heading: NEW OPERATOR (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: Sheriff's.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Detective Marium, please.
text: He can hear AGITATED VOICES in the background there.
speaker_heading: NEW OPERATOR (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: Detective Marium isn't available.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Is there...my name is Russell Core,
dialog: he knows me, can I leave hima
dialog: message? It’s regarding Bailey
dialog: Slone.
text: A pause. He hears SHOUTING, many other phones RINGING there.
speaker_heading: NEW OPERATOR (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: What's the message?
text: But he’s suddenly unsure how to phrase it...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Just tell him, in Keelut...there
dialog: was an old woman I spoke to and I
dialog: think she may have...it’s...
speaker_heading: NEW OPERATOR (PHONE V.O.)
dialog: Sir, what's the message?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I’m sorry. Please just ask him to
dialog: call me. The Quick Dog Motel, Room
dialog: 207, he uh...he knows me. C-O-R-E.
dialog: 51.
text: The line goes dead. The television flickers with bomblight.
text: He replaces the handset, his mouth tight.
text: And he just stands there. Thinking.
scene_heading: EXT. QUICK DOG MOTEL - DAY
text: Core emerges from his room, blinking against the sunlight.
text: It’s overcast but his room is a dark cave behind him.
text: He zips his coat, blowing noisily at the sudden cold, and
text: hurries out towards his RENTAL SUV.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - MORGUE - DAWN
text: LOW, looking up at Marium as he stares down at--
text: THE TWO MURDERED DEPUTIES, white and frosted-over where they
text: fell, faces frozen mid-scream.
text: OTHER COPS mill about, a susurrus of TENSE MURMURS. Marium
text: sees confusion and fear and anger on their faces.
text: A YOUNG COP (ARNIE), just a kid, hurries out of the morgue.
text: Marium sees how shaken he is, pats the air like, Calm down.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: Boss. There’s more.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Another body?
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: Uh...no.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MORGUE - DAY

text: THE STEEL TABLE with Bailey’s little BODY BAG on it, which is
text: splayed open and empty.
text: Staring at this, but addressing Arnie--
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going to Keelut. Now.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: Who?
text: Marium glances to the kid, grimly.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Everybody.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL SUV (MOVING) - DAY
text: Huddled over the wheel with a cup of steaming tea, haggard
text: but determined, Core drives alone THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE.
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, appearing like a mirage, that painted
text: wooden sign. Keelut.
text: EXT. WOODS AT THE EDGE OF KEELUT - DAY
text: Core works through knee-deep snow: he’s got SLONE’S BOOTS but
dialog: no snowshoes, so it’s difficult.
text: A spasm of deep-chest COUGHING bends him over and he sags
text: against a tree until he recovers his wind.
text: And when he does...he glances around, realizing something.
dialog: Even for Keelut, isn’t it especially quiet? Like the whole
text: place is holding its breath.
dialog: He continues onward to...
scene_heading: EXT. ILLANAQ’S HUT - DAY
text: ..-emerging out of the trees. As Core nears, he sees that--
text: The CHIMNEY isn’t smoking. The FRONT DOOR hangs open a crack.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Hello?
text: He draws closer, stopping ten feet away, watching the place
text: uncertainly, how the FRONT DOOR sways on its rusty hinges.
dialog: 53.
text: He cups his hands and--
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: HELLO.
text: THE FRONT DOOR moves a few inches...but nobody appears.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ma’ am?
text: He steps carefully forward, but GASPS as--
text: A LYNX SUDDENLY PEEKS OUT, GLARING AT HIM WITH THOSE ANGRY
text: YELLOW EYES AND INSTANTLY DASHING OFF INTO THE WOODS.
text: He watches it go, and continues to the door where...
scene_heading: INT. ILLANAQ’S HUT - SAME
text: .--he knocks lightly, steps inside. It’s cold and dim in
text: here, and he’s squinting to see...
text: .+-how boneless Illanaq looks in her chair, next to the
text: barely-smoldering fireplace with her head tipped back.
text: HER THROAT IS SLASHED EAR TO EAR to make a great yawning
text: second-mouth, her entire front a BIB OF BRIGHT FROZEN BLOOD.
text: Her FINGERTIPS have been gnawed by animals.
text: Core sways before her like he’s been clubbed. He looks
text: around, pointlessly, for some kind of answer to this.
text: Shaking his head, weakly, as if in disagreement with some
text: minor point of order...he backs away.
scene_heading: EXT. ILLANAQ’S HUT - SAME
text: He staggers outside, beset by a fresh fit of COUGHING, which
text: evolves into DRY HEAVES that bring him to his knees.
text: It seems like he might stay there with his face in the snow
text: forever until...vvrrrRRRMMM. He looks up to see--
text: DISTANTLY THROUGH THE TREES, a column of THREE SHERIFF’S
text: TRUCKS coming up the MAIN ROAD INTO KEELUT.
text: Core lurches upright, uselessly waving, trying to call out
text: but he’s hoarse from the coughing--
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Hey! Wait!
dialog: 54.
text: So he trumps slowly after them.
scene_heading: EXT. CHEEON’S HOUSE - KEELUT - DAY
text: THOSE THREE SHERIFF’S TRUCKS arrive, joining THREE OTHER
text: TRUCKS already angled in the road, COPS IN BODY ARMOR with
text: rifles and shotguns all facing towards us.
text: Half look like they haven’t started shaving, half look like
text: retired fishermen. Their Kevlar is ill-fitting. Uniformly
dialog: petrified.
text: MARIUM is at the front of the group, also in BODY ARMOR, his
text: face grimly set.
text: He glances back at his ASSEMBLED MEN. In particular, he makes
text: eye contact with terrified ARNIE, gives a reassuring nod.
text: He gestures ‘over there, over there’ and waits as the men
dialog: position themselves in front of--
text: THIS SQUARE TWO-STORY CABIN in the middle of town. From
text: inside the LOFT-STYLE WINDOW on the second floor, faintly,
text: comes some kind of electric WHIRRING.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: Which is Cheeon, bent over something with his ELECTRIC DRILL,
text: powering screws into the floor. Can’t see exactly what it is.
text: From downstairs comes a firm KNOCK-KNOCK but Cheeon just
text: keeps drilling, wholly unconcerned. V2Z2222.
scene_heading: EXT. KEELUT MAIN ROAD - SAME
text: Core emerges breathless and coughing from the woods, leans
text: against his RENTAL TRUCK parked there, and looks--
text: A WAYS UP THE ROAD, where all those POLICE VEHICLES are
text: gathered with their lights turning.
text: He starts heading that way, like drawn by a magnet.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DOOR - CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: The door opens on Marium: steady but not aggressive. Behind
text: him, we glimpse the GATHERED COPS, their weapons ready.
text: Cheeon, in the doorway, might as well not even see them. He
text: keeps his eyes on Marium, at once empty and hostile.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I told them I'd try talking. Get
dialog: you to come without any mess. I’m
dialog: not claiming we're friends, but
dialog: we've been friendly, Cheeon.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: If you say so, guy.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: We've got two dead cops in town.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: Oh yeah? Round here, couple dead
dialog: cops is cause for a party.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: And the coroner? Frank was set to
dialog: retire to San Diego next month.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: San Diego, huh? Never heard of it.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: They were shot with a .45
dialog: Springfield. You’ve got one of
dialog: those registered.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: I got lots not registered, guy.
text: Cheeon lets the implication hang there. Marium blinks.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I know that. But, like I said, I
dialog: told them I’d try to talk to you.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: You're damn sure doing that.
text: DOWN THE ROAD, fifty yards back, Core draws closer, trying to
text: see what’s going on with SHERIFF’S TRUCKS and MEN up there.
text: He glances off, sees a YUP’IK FACE crouched in their window.
text: BACK AT CHEEON’S DOOR, Marium puts some iron in his tone.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Where’s Vernon?
text: Cheeon snorts. Cocks an eyebrow. You think I'd answer that?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you at least tell me where the
dialog: boy's body is? It’s state’s
dialog: evidence.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: “Evidence?” That boy is nothing to
dialog: your kind anymore. He’s no longer
dialog: of the Earth. Put him out of your
dialog: mind or he might haunt you.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Where’s Medora?
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: Oh, she'll be found. Not by you.
text: Marium grimaces, disgust briefly overtaking him.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Is that why this happened? So
dialog: nobody interferes with his revenge?
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: I look like I enjoy all these
dialog: fucking questions from you, guy?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I know your girl was taken by
dialog: wolves.
text: Cheeon’s eyes flash rage.
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you don’t have a body to
dialog: bury and there can’t be anything
dialog: worse than that.
text: Cheeon takes half a step forward and--
text: THE COPS all tense, rifle stocks tightening into shoulders,
text: fingers on triggers.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: (low & furious)
dialog: Oh you know, huh? Lotta help from a
dialog: guy who knows. You drive an hour
dialog: out here for my sorry ass, but
dialog: won't do shit for some dead kids in
text: the hills. She was riding her sled.
dialog: And what'd you do about it?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: We came.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: You came the next day and left and
dialog: never came back. Worthless as shit,
dialog: you city boys.
text: IN THE ROAD, twenty yards back now, Core draws closer. He can
text: see Marium talking to someone in a doorway. He can see--
text: A COP with A SNIPER RIFLE dart into the WOODS by the house.
scene_heading: BACK AT CHEEON’S DOOR
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Five thousand people is hardly a
dialog: city.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: You come here to argue the
dialog: definition of city with me, guy?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I’m saying, we're not so different
dialog: from you.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: You sure as hell are. Went to
dialog: college and still dumber than
dialog: dogshit.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I’m saying, we’re not all bad. We
dialog: helped put this place on the grid
dialog: few years back, got the plumbing
dialog: and electric.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: And now you want a trophy for
dialog: letting these folks take a shit in
dialog: their own house?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Okay. Yeah. Things are bad here. I
dialog: admit that. Let’s not make them
dialog: worse. You got a wife who needs
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: Oh, she’s gone. She’ll never be
dialog: back after what happened. This
dialog: place’ll be a ghost town by next
dialog: year, you watch.
text: Cheeon looks beyond Marium, not at the cops but out at the
text: woods and the sky, formulating a thought.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CHEEON (CONT'D)
dialog: Those bastards at the morgue.
dialog: Bastards like you and me? When
dialog: we're killed the past is killed,
dialog: and the past is already dead, so no
dialog: big deal. But when kids are killed,
dialog: that’s different. When kids are
dialog: killed the future dies. And there's
dialog: no life without a future.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: (very softly)
dialog: Cheeon. Please.
text: Now Cheeon looks to the cops. Sniffs in derision.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: These boys look like they don’t
dialog: know whether to shit or piss.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I won’t lie. Most of ‘em are green.
dialog: They never seen anything like this
dialog: and they’re scared to death and
dialog: that’s dangerous for you.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: ‘Come out with your hands up.’ Like
dialog: that, guy? Listen, here: it’s never
dialog: gonna happen.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I'll make sure everything’s fair.
text: At that, astonishingly, Cheeon actually laughs, a high nasal
dialog: cackle. That’s the funniest thing he’s ever heard.
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: “Everything is fair?”
text: Marium nods in defeat, shows his palms, backs away...
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Think about what I’ve offered.
text: As he turns back into the road, Cheeon calls to him...
speaker_heading: CHEEON
dialog: And you think about the phone call
dialog: your wife’ll get today. Her hand on
dialog: her belly. Nothing gonna stop that
dialog: call now, guy.
dialog: 59.
text: Marium doesn’t turn back, keeps walking stiffly away, his jaw
text: tight as Cheeon SLAMS the door behind him.
text: IN THE ROAD, Core has arrived on the scene, ten yards behind
text: the cops. Exposed.
text: Nobody notices him, all focused on Cheeon’s door. He looks a
text: bit like a lost little kid, needing to ask directions.
text: As Marium returns to his line of men, Arnie leans in, scared
dialog: shitless--
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: W-what’d he say?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: He said ‘fuck you’, is what he
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: Jesus. Now what?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Now we wait for Holy Cross to get
dialog: the tactical unit up here.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: They're three hours out, boss.
text: Marium surveys the men, looking to him for answers he doesn’t
dialog: have.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Well...better get some coffee n’
dialog: sandwiches then.
text: And then, just beyond his men, there in the road, he sees
text: Core. Their eyes meet and Marium straightens in dismayed
dialog: confusion: why are you here?
text: As Core raises his hand in hesitant greeting...
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WINDOW - CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: THE LOFT-STYLE WINDOW OPENS OUTWARD to show the POLICE spread
text: below. WE PULL BACK SLIGHTLY to reveal--
scene_heading: THE LONG METAL SNOUT OF A TRIPOD-MOUNTED M-60 MACHINE GUN
text: swiveling onto the MEN down there, sighting on MARIUM’S BACK.
text: CHEEON settles behind the enormous weapon, prone position,
text: one hand poised to feed it an ENDLESS BELT OF AMMUNITION.
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: EXT. CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: Walking towards Marium, Core’s eyes flick to something behind
text: him and he points up in sudden terror--
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Watch--
dialog: Marium jerks aside as--
scene_heading: BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: THE FACE OF THE COP NEXT TO MARIUM EXPLODES IN A RED SHERBET.
text: MARIUM DIVES TO THE GROUND.
text: CORE STARTLES IN PLACE, HANDS FOOLISHLY COVERING HIS HEAD.
text: OTHER COPS RETURN FIRE, Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.
text: But all is overwhelmed by the brutal authority of the M-60:
text: the SOUND of it is DEAFENING and CEASELESS, one prolonged
text: uninterrupted blast. See? It’s still going on.
scene_heading: BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
scene_heading: MARIUM CRAWLS BEHIND A TRUCK. WINDOW GLASS ATOMIZES, SPRAYS.
text: CORE DROPS TO HIS HANDS AND KNEES AS A LINE OF BULLETS SHEARS
scene_heading: INTO THE ROAD BESIDE HIM. BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: IN THE ATTIC WINDOW, Cheeon swivels calmly, still firing--
scene_heading: BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: A LINE OF COPS ARE CUT DOWN, blood misting left to right,
text: their body armor punched through like paper mache.
text: BEHIND A TRUCK, Marium huddles next to ARNIE and ANOTHER COP,
text: both cowering.
text: BULLETS stream into the engine block and it sounds like
text: HAMMERS STRIKING ANVILS in rapid succession. Pung!Pung!Pung!
text: IN THE ROAD, Core wriggles behind ANOTHER TRUCK just as a COP
text: drops before him, clutching a BLOOD-SQUIRTING THROAT HOLE.
text: Core crawls to the Cop, presses his hands to the wound but--
scene_heading: BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: A SPRAY OF METAL AND GLASS AND DIRT SENDS HIM SCUTTLING AWAY.
dialog: 61.
text: IN THE ATTIC WINDOW, an INCOMING ROUND punches the wall
text: behind Cheeon--KAK!--and he swivels to--
text: THE TREES AT THE EDGE OF HIS YARD, where he spots a blip of
text: DARK MOVEMENT in the branches and sprays the M-60 there--
scene_heading: BAK. BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: THE TREE ERUPTS SNOW, looks like an explosion of pure white
text: fire that spills out the POLICE SNIPER’S SHREDDED BODY.
text: BEHIND THE TRUCK, Marium has his SIDEARM out--
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Arnie. Arnie. Listen to me.
text: ARNIE just gapes at Marium, blinking wildly as--
scene_heading: BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: THE OTHER COP directly beside Arnie is SHOT THROUGH THE BODY
text: OF TRUCK, metal shards splitting his chest and face.
text: Marium hisses, blood-spattered, peeks out to see--
text: AN EXPOSED BOULDER BY THE TREELINE, like a giant’s skull
text: emerging from the ground, the size of a car.
text: He whips back to panic-frozen Arnie--
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: WE HAVE TO GO.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: (nodding ferociously)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: (when Arnie doesn’t move)
speaker_heading: NOW.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: I-I don’t want to.
text: BEHIND ANOTHER TRUCK, Core is flat on the ground, looking out
text: from underneath it, shaking, awestruck--
text: He sees DEAD AND WOUNDED COPS splayed before CHEEON’S HOUSE
text: with MUZZLE FLASHES flaming out of the ATTIC WINDOW.
scene_heading: BAK. BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: A PANICKING COP DIVES INTO A BULLET-RIDDLED TRUCK, THROWS IT
text: INTO REVERSE, SPINS THE TIRES TRYING TO BACK UP--VRRRRRR!
dialog: 62.
text: IN THE ATTIC WINDOW, Cheeon swivels onto this and--
scene_heading: BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: HE POURS BULLETS INTO THE TRUCK UNTIL THE RADIATOR EXPLODES
text: AND IT ROLLS LAZILY BACKWARDS DOWN THE ROAD.
text: FROM BEHIND HIS TRUCK, Core watches it roll slowly by like
text: some lumbering beast gushing steam, not five feet away.
text: For the first time in what seems like hours, the shooting
text: pauses. Wounded men WHIMPER but the relative silence booms.
text: FROM BEHIND THEIR TRUCK, Marium drags Arnie with him.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Move.
text: INTO THE OPEN, Marium and Arnie sprint for the BOULDER,
text: moving at a diagonal towards the house.
text: FROM BEHIND HIS TRUCK, Core watches them breathlessly.
text: MARIUM AND ARNIE are halfway there when--
scene_heading: BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: THE GROUND BESIDE THEM EXPLODES as Cheeon’s fusillade resumes
text: and THEY DIVE BEHIND THE BOULDER, HUDDLING TOGETHER--
scene_heading: BAK. BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: BULLETS SLAP INTO THE GRANITE THAT SHIELDS THEM. Tok!Tok!Tok!
text: Marium speaks directly into Arnie’s face, who’s so fucking
dialog: scared he might as well be inside of a dream--
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: Arnie’s sidearm)
dialog: Is that magazine full?
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: It’s full.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Please check.
text: Arnie checks it, fumbles it back into the gun.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: It’s full.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: You have more in that vest?
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: BAK. BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
dialog: 
text: ACROSS THE YARD, a SECONDARY CLUSTER OF COPS are directing
text: fire on the ATTIC WINDOW now. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.
text: IN THE ATTIC WINDOW, Cheeon swivels off the boulder to spray
scene_heading: down on them. BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
dialog: 
text: BACK BEHIND THE BOULDER
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Listen to me now, Arnie. Are you
dialog: listening?
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: Yeah, boss.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
text: His weapon can’t get through rock.
dialog: Stay here. You understand?
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I’m going to run for the house. The
dialog: second I do--Arnie, I am saying the
dialog: very second I do--you unload on
dialog: that window and don’t stop until
dialog: you see me reach the house.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: O-okay.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: What will you do?
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: Stay here. And. The window.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Soon as I run.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Do not stop shooting until I'm
dialog: there.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: I understand, boss. I'1l do it.
text: Marium peeks over the rim of the boulder to see--
text: OUT THERE, Cheeon fires on Cops--BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.--whose
text: return fire is panicky and innefectual. Bang. Bang. Bang.
text: Marium gives one last this is it look to Arnie and HE RUNS.
text: ARNIE POPS UP over the boulder and FIRES WILDLY at the attic
dialog: window as--
text: MARIUM SPRINTS across the open space between the BOULDER and
text: the HOUSE: not more than thirty feet, seems like a mile.
text: IN THE ATTIC WINDOW, Cheeon flattens himself as BULLETS
text: SPLINTER THE WALLS BEHIND HIM, the M-60 oozing smoke.
text: FROM BEHIND HIS TRUCK, Core watches as Marium slams against
text: the house, directly below the smoking ATTIC WINDOW.
text: AT THE BOULDER, Arnie fires until--Bam. Bam. CLICK. The slide
text: racks empty, he drops down, fumbling for a new magazine.
text: IN THE ATTIC WINDOW, as the fire upon him stops, Cheeon rises
text: back into his shooting position, sighting down the M-60.
text: AT THE HOUSE, Marium keeps himself flat against the wall as
dialog: he slides around--
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND CHEEON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: --where there is a REAR DOOR. Marium slides towards it,
text: weapon forward, adrenaline-jacked.
scene_heading: EXT. CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: IN THE ATTIC WINDOW, Cheeon sights down on that BOULDER where
text: the slightest sliver of Arnie is visible, so--
scene_heading: BAK. BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
text: BEHIND THE BOULDER, suddenly beset by this new round of
text: gunfire, ARNIE SCREAMS, nearly drops his weapon, ducks low.
text: THE SECONDARY COPS rack their shotguns and rifles and resume
dialog: firing themselves. Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
text: IN THE ATTIC WINDOW, Cheeon grunts as BURNING SHRAPNEL
text: slashes his face and he swivels back to the Secondary Cops.
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: BAK. BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
dialog: 
text: THE SECONDARY COPS ARE BLASTED HARD. Of the EIGHT of them
text: crouched there, FIVE are instantly RIPPED APART: blood and
text: meat and scraps of uniform flying into the air.
text: BEHIND THE BOULDER, Arnie SCREAMS AGAIN.
text: BEHIND HIS TRUCK, Core watches the COPS CRUMPLE AND FALL.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: The GUNFIRE and SCREAMS ECHO back here as Marium inches to
text: the BACK DOOR, peering carefully in though sooty GLASS PANES.
text: He grips the DOORKNOB and, bizarrely, it turns.
text: A deep breath for courage and he eases it open but wait--
scene_heading: INT. BACK DOOR - CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: LOOKING OUT ON MARIUM THROUGH THE DOOR WINDOW as he freezes,
text: terrified eyes locked on something dead ahead.
text: RACK FOCUS TO THE TAUT FISHING LINE STRETCHED VERTICALLY JUST
text: INSIDE THE DOOR, CONNECTED TO THE INSIDE KNOB.
text: As Marium’s eyes move up the line, WE MOVE UP THE LINE TOO--
text: Just above the doorjamb it turns ninety-degrees through an
text: EYE-SCREW and continues until it connects to--
text: THE SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN AFFIXED TO THE WALL, aimed down into
text: the doorway, the fishing line tight against its trigger.
text: Instant death, right there.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: As Marium shakily removes his hand from the doorknob--
scene_heading: EXT. CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: BEHIND THE BOULDER, Arnie loses it: he sprints.
text: BEHIND HIS TRUCK, Core’s shaking his head No No No as--
text: OUT THERE, Arnie stumbles in a blind panic towards the house.
dialog: 66.
text: IN THE ATTIC WINDOW, Cheeon swivels back to Arnie crossing
text: below him and--BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.BAK.
dialog: 
text: ARNIE IS SHOT ACROSS THE SHINS AND CRASHES INTO THE GROUND.
scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: At the exact instant of this GUNFIRE, Marium PUNCHES out a
text: WINDOW PANE in the door, the sound of it covered.
text: He reaches in towards that FISHING LINE with his SWISS ARMY
text: KNIFE, the little scissors extended. Snip!
scene_heading: EXT. CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: BEHIND HIS TRUCK, Core moans involuntarily as--
text: OUT THERE, CHEEON STRAFES ARNIE A SECOND TIME, A STREAK OF
text: BULLETS CHOPPING HIS LEGS.
text: As Arnie SCREAMS, something livid snaps inside of Core. Look--
text: A DEAD COP a few feet away, his SHOTGUN just lying there.
text: CORE GRABS IT, CHARGES OUT FROM BEHIND THE TRUCK, AWKWARDLY
scene_heading: PUMP-FIRING THE SHOTGUN AS HE RUNS--BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!
scene_heading: BUCKSHOT PATTERNS PEPPER THE ATTIC WINDOW AND--
text: IN THE WINDOW, CHEEON FLINCHES OFF THE M-60 AS SPLINTERS AND
text: GLASS BLOW ALL AROUND.
text: CORE RUNS AND FIRES--BAM! BAM! Click! He drops the shotgun as
text: he reaches Arnie, grabs the SCREAMING cop by the armpits.
speaker_heading: ARNIE
dialog: .-.I’m gonna die...gonna die...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: (gritted teeth)
dialog: No.
text: IN THE ATTIC WINDOW, Cheeon’s bloody face rises back into
text: view. Gripping the M-60 again, he looks resigned.
text: He sights on Core, struggling to drag Arnie towards the
text: boulder. He tracks with them, could cut them down at will.
text: DOWN THERE, Core pulls Arnie across the muddy snowy ground as
text: fast as he can but, oh God, it’s so slow. Arnie SOBS.
text: Without stopping, Core chances a look upwards at--
dialog: 67.
text: THE ATTIC WINDOW, where he can see Cheeon, plain as day,
text: watching him from behind the smoking M-60. A strange beat of
text: eye contact between the two men. It enrages Core.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: STOP IT.
text: Core sees Cheeon lower his eye over the gunsight, preparing
text: to fire on them. The boulder is so close.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: A PAIR OF BOOTS carefully ascend WOODEN STAIRS, stepping on
text: the WASH OF SPENT CARTRIDGES that have cascaded down them.
text: FOLLOWING THE BOOTS up to--—
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
text: --where we REVEAL CHEEON FROM BEHIND, over there by the
text: window, prone behind the M-60.
text: ON CHEEON, his hand tightening around the trigger and--
text: WE PAN SLIGHTLY TO REVEAL THE FIGURE RISING FROM THE
text: STAIRWELL BEHIND HIM. They make no noise but...
text: Cheeon blinks. Knows they’re there. Twists around into a
text: SITTING POSITION to look back at...
text: MARIUM, aiming his HANDGUN two-handed. And scared to
dialog: goddamned death, it would appear.
text: Cheeon snorts, spits blood, his lip curling at the cop across
text: the low-ceilinged attic. The floor is carpeted with brass.
text: The air is blue with cordite.

dialog: You stopped that phone call for
dialog: today, guy. Phone call to your
dialog: wife?
text: Marium stares, doesn’t say a word, his gun steady.
speaker_heading: CHEEON (CONT'D)
dialog: But it’s coming, ain’t it? That
dialog: call’s always coming.
text: Cheeon brings out a little NICKLE-PLATED .25 PISTOL but
text: doesn’t aim it at Marium, just lets it sit there in his lap.
dialog: Like a dare. Or permission.
dialog: 68.
text: MARIUM SHOOTS HIM IN THE FACE. BANG.
scene_heading: EXT. CHEEON’S HOUSE - SAME
text: Just as CORE REACHES THE BOULDER WITH ARNIE, he looks up to
text: see CHEEON’S BODY spill backwards out of the attic window and
text: land below with a dense and final THUD.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: IN BLACKNESS, A SONG. A beautiful, melancholy arrangement of
text: INUIT FLUTE and ghostly FEMALE VOCALS. It carries to...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
text: ...-where we are in SLOW MOTION and the haunting MUSIC COVERS
dialog: EVERYTHING. As we...
text: PUSH DOWN THE HALL the foreground is continuously blurred by
text: out-of-focus movement, POLICE and HOSPITAL STAFF and
text: CONCERNED RELATIVES hurriedly wiping the frame.
text: PUSHING THROUGH TO AN INUIT WOMAN (35) waiting on the bench
text: at the far end, her eyes swollen from crying, her hands on
text: her pregnant belly. Her name is SUSAN. She looks searchingly
text: into this chaos and she sees...
text: A BLEEDING UNCONSCIOUS COP being intubated, his clothes
text: getting scissored off by ER NURSES.
text: AN ANGRY COP barking into his radio, a CRYING COP beside him.
text: A TRAUMA TEAM rushing by with a GUNSHOT VICTIM COP.
text: A CLUSTER OF FRANTIC WIVES talking to a stunned ER DOCTOR.
text: A TRIO OF FRIGHTENED CHILDREN, huddled by the soda machine.
text: And as we finally land CLOSE ON SUSAN, she looks to...
text: THE ER ENTRANCE where PARAMEDICS are now rushing ARNIE in, an
text: oxygen pump on his pale face...and MARIUM hurrying alongside.
text: Through the blur of bodies, his eyes meet hers.
text: Tears spill down her face, great pulsing sobs of relief.
text: They connect on the bench, clasping each other, sobbing into
text: his shoulder, stroking her hair and saying soothing things.
dialog: 69.
dialog: We can’t hear the words but maybe we can read his lips. It's
dialog: okay. It's okay. It's okay.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL BATHROOM - DAY
text: Normal sound and motion resume: FRANTIC VOICES churn outside
text: the door, muted but briefly surging as it swings open and...
text: Marium enters, goes to the sink. We see it happen in the
dialog: mirror: whatever calm assurance he projected before now
text: utterly dissolves.
text: Staring wide-eyed into the drain, hyperventilating, one hand
text: over his mouth, struggling to control himself, until...
text: He notices CORE in the mirror. Sitting quietly in the corner,
text: knees drawn up, head titled against the wall. He looks
text: clammy, bloodless, unwell. Drops of vomit in his beard.
text: They look at each other a long moment.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: (softly)
dialog: I’m not prepared for this.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: You saved that kid’s life.
text: Core stares at him with an uncharacteristic blankness.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I saw his wife out there. He’s
text: going to go home to his daughter.
dialog: It won’t be for a while but...he
dialog: will go home. Yes, to them it
dialog: matters a great deal.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: How many died?
dialog: It’s hard for Marium to say it.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
text: Twelve. And Cheeon. A few more
dialog: are...we’re not sure yet.
text: Core’s voice drops to a disgusted whisper...
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: And I saved one.
text: The two men face each other from opposite sides of the room.
text: White tile, buzzing lights, raised voices outside as we...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: IN BLACKNESS, we hear NIGHT BIRDS shriek from far away.
scene_heading: EXT. A TREELINE - NIGHT
text: The ground is black and damp: no snow. In the distance,
text: surrounded by darkness at the edge of the woods: a raggedy
text: TENT and a small CAMPFIRE, a MAN-SHAPE hunched there.
scene_heading: INT. SLONE HOME - SAME
text: And Vernon Slone’s at the BACK WINDOW, staring out at him
text: with a predatory stillness. He’s uninjured here, younger.
text: Medora drifts up to his side, gazing out the window as well.
dialog: So, again, this is some other time.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: (without moving his eyes)
text: Another drifter headed west.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
text: He looks hungry.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: He can hunt.
text: We might notice that the CAMPFIRE is flickering out there at
dialog: more or less the same spot we saw the Wolf at the beginning.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Take him something so he'll go,
dialog: Vernon.
text: Vernon looks at her, a faint warmth passing over his face,
text: and he goes. As Medora looks uneasily back out the window...
text: WE TILT DOWN to find her PREGNANT BELLY. Eight months or so.
dialog: 71.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
text: The DRIFTER (20s) lifts his scabby, bug-bitten face from the
text: fire: one milky eye, long stringy hair from under his woolen
text: watch cap, brown teeth-nubs showing in a kindly smile as...
text: Slone approaches the ring of firelight. Staring down at the
text: grinning Drifter in appraisal. A moment like that, the fire
text: crackling between them, and Slone tosses down a FOOD SACK.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: That’s bread and cheese. It’s
dialog: dropping low tonight, first snows
dialog: are coming, so you need to move on
dialog: from here.
speaker_heading: DRIFTER
dialog: Termination dust won’t come on
dialog: tonight. Night or two before that.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: You a weatherman?
text: The Drifter’s smile shines and spreads.
speaker_heading: DRIFTER
dialog: You could say I know something
dialog: about what’s coming.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You got a name?
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: My name’s got nothing to do with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DRIFTER
dialog: Not yours. The boy’s.
text: Slone’s eyes sharpen and narrow. He seems to coil.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: What do you know about that?
speaker_heading: DRIFTER
dialog: Just a feelin’.
text: The Drifter smiles past Slone’s shoulder, out at THEIR CABIN
text: where MEDORA is silhouetted in the orange-lighted window.
speaker_heading: DRIFTER (CONT'D)
text: Looks warm.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Best find a home of your own, then.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: DRIFTER
dialog: I don’t mean the house.
text: His tone is not lascivious, though, it’s damn near reverent.
text: But Slone leans closer, his voice dropping to a low monotone.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Look into my face now. Believe what
dialog: I tell you. I will end your every
dialog: day. Do you believe me when I say
dialog: that to you?
text: The Drifter nods, placating. Sure, sure.
speaker_heading: SLONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Move on.
text: Slone rises and heads back. The Drifter watches him go.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SLONE CABIN - NIGHT, LATER
text: Medora lays asleep on the bed, curled on her side under a
text: quilt in the mostly-dark room.
text: Slone watches her from the doorway with something almost like
dialog: fear.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS BEHIND THE SLONE CABIN - NIGHT
text: Slone is a wraith cutting through the woods, quick and
text: silent, garbed in black. The DYING CAMPFIRE glows just beyond
text: the trees: he’s circling around behind it.
scene_heading: EXT. TREELINE - THE CAMPIRE - SAME
text: Slone melts out of the forest, his BOWIE KNIFE a shining
text: sliver in one fist as he angles in on the DRIFTER’S TENT.
text: He crouches, listening.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. DRIFTER’S TENT - SAME
text: Slone snaps open the flap but--
text: It’s empty. Looking closer, he sees--
text: Resting on the filthy sleeping bag, crudely carved from a bar
text: of soap, a tiny FERTILITY FIGURE.
dialog: 73.
text: Dread pooling on his face, Slone looks back to the cabin.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SLONE CABIN - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON MEDORA, a film of perspiration on her face, wincing
text: in discomfort as she comes blearily half-awake to see...
text: A SHAPE in the doorway, looking in at her.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: .-.-what’re you doing, baby?
text: THE SHAPE doesn’t answer.
text: She sits up, achingly holding her belly.
speaker_heading: MEDORA (CONT'D)
dialog: .--oh God...something’s happening.
text: And now, her eyes adjusting, she sees that it’s not Slone
text: standing in the doorway. Her face hardens in terror.
speaker_heading: MEDORA (CONT'D)
text: There’s money in a jar by the sink.
dialog: Fifty dollars. And food.
text: The Drifter’s manner is calmly sympathetic, comforting even.
speaker_heading: DRIFTER
dialog: I came to warn you. The boy can’t
dialog: live.
text: She flinches as he reaches into his coat, pulls SOMETHING out
text: and tosses it onto the bed before her...
text: It’s THE SHAMAN’S MASK.
speaker_heading: DRIFTER (CONT'D)
dialog: The mask is yours. Someone made it
dialog: for you.
text: She gapes at the upside-down WOLF FACE in revulsion.
speaker_heading: DRIFTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Wear the mask and you’1l know what
dialog: you have to do.
text: A SILVER TRIANGLE EMERGES FROM WITHIN THE DRIFTER’S THROAT,
text: HOLDS THERE, AND THEN WITHDRAWS BACK INSIDE HIS NECK.
text: He looks so surprised.
dialog: 74.
text: BLOOD GURGLES FROM THE SLIT THAT REMAINS IN HIS ADAM'S APPLE
text: AS HE DROPS TO THE FLOOR.
text: SLONE is behind him clutching the blood-slicked BOWIE KNIFE.
text: Medora CRIES in sudden pain and throws back the quilt, the
text: WOLF MASK spilling off to the floor.
text: Her sheets are soaked with AMNIOTIC FLUID.
text: Slone rushes to her.
text: LOW ANGLE on the WOLF MASK and the DEAD DRIFTER, canted
text: together and forgotten on the floor as, in the background,
text: Slone bends lovingly over Medora and she SCREAMS AGAIN...
scene_heading: INT. 4X4 - DAY, LATE AFTERNOON
text: HER SCREAM ECHOES INTO THIS TIME as Slone stares out his
text: truck, living that memory, suffused in cold orange light.
text: He looks to the passenger seat and reaches for...
text: A FOLDED MAP, revealing that POLAROID of Medora beneath.
text: We’1l notice the COMPOUND BOW wedged behind the seat, his
text: DUFFEL BAG with the guns in it.
text: As he studies the map...
text: SLONE’S POV (MACRO ON THE MAP) moves from a splash of LAKE
text: until it lands on A SMALL DOT: ‘KMC-13’.
text: He sets the map down, puts the truck in gear.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE — SAME
text: SLONE’S TRUCK pulls away from this seemingly infinite body of
text: water where the Sun collapses into molten copper.
scene_heading: EXT. HUNTING TRAIL - SAME
text: SNOW CHAINS rattle and groan on the tires as...
text: SLONE’S 4x4 crawls slowly along under a canopy of cottonwood:
text: snowy, unmarked wilderness.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED MINING CAMP - TWILIGHT
text: SLONE’S 4x4 pulls in on a snowy road as we see--
dialog: 75.
text: THE SMALL VALLEY the road winds through, a V-shape cut into
text: the earth with a CLUSTER OF DARK CORRODED WOODEN BUILDINGS
text: spreading up one side, interconnected one atop the other like
text: some long-dead fungal growth.
text: A paint-peeling SIGN: CAMP #13 - Kennebeck & McCarthy Corp.
text: There’s still some daylight left in the sky above but down
text: here, in the valley, it feels like an early nightfall.
speaker_heading: INT. 4X4 (MOVING) - SAME
text: Slone scans the dead, lightless camp as he drives. To his
text: right, a ways up the unconstructed side of the valley,
text: FIRELIGHT DANCES...seemingly from within the Earth.
text: He drives on.
scene_heading: EXT. INN - NIGHT
text: Slone parks before this leaning TWO-STORY BUILDING with ‘Inn’
text: painted by hand above the door, inky light in its sooty
text: windows. He gets out, glances around, sees...
text: A CORRUGATED SHED with a pyramid of CAR BATTERIES outside it.
text: Empty WOOD PALLETS stacked for firewood, a half-collapsed
text: QUONSET HUT, a SCHOOL BUS slowly sinking into the ground.
scene_heading: INT. INN - NIGHT
text: Slone enters, closing the door quickly to shut out the cold.
text: THE INNKEEPER (50s) looks up from her table: she’s stout, in
text: overalls and fleece, with wild Brillo hair and Coke-bottle
text: glasses, reading a celebrity magazine from 10 years ago.
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Late in the season for travelers.
text: As Slone crosses to her...
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Where you coming from?
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Keelut.
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER
dialog: There’s no road from there to here.
dialog: Not directly.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Not directly, no.
text: He looks around, takes in the room: kerosene lamps, lynx
text: pelts, a broken chair burning in the fireplace. It dawns on
dialog: him...
speaker_heading: SLONE (CONT'D)
dialog: I was here when I was a child. With
dialog: my father. We visited this camp. I
dialog: remember it.
text: She squints at him, trying to place his face.
text: He brings out the POLAROID, shows it to her. She chuckles.
speaker_heading: SLONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Was she here?
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER
dialog: They don’t got women in Keelut,
dialog: gotta crawl all the way up here for
dialog: a piece?
text: Slone just stares at her. As she applies some ChapStick,
text: looking him up and down...
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER (CONT'D)
dialog: (almost to herself)
dialog: You are a handsome one, aren’t ya.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Can you help me?
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER
dialog: I don’t have any bread, gotta warn
dialog: ya, the plane hasn’t been back in
dialog: two weeks. But I have a room to
dialog: let. I’d make sure it’s warm
dialog: enough.
text: She lets that hang for a moment, grinning.
text: He turns away, heads for the door, but as he pulls it open--
text: He stops.
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, she was here.
text: Closes the door. Turns.
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER (CONT'D)
dialog: That one in your picture there.
dialog: They don’t make that kind of film
dialog: anymore.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER
dialog: Two nights ago. Said she wanted to
dialog: see our Indian Hunter. He’s not
dialog: really Indian, though, he’s just
dialog: John.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER
dialog: Didn’t share that and I didn’t ask.
dialog: Struck me as damned skittish, you
dialog: want the truth.
dialog: Slone absorbs this, and then...
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: I want to stay in the room she
dialog: took.
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER
dialog: Only two rooms. Other one’s mine. I
dialog: hadn’t actually changed the sheets
dialog: yet, hope you don’t mind.
text: As she rummages around for the ROOM KEY...
speaker_heading: INNKEEPER (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know about your vehicle's
dialog: battery but you might wanna get it
text: in the shed before it drops
dialog: tonight. Radio says it’s a storm.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - INN - NIGHT
text: The Innkeeper unlocks it, lets Slone enter. He stands there
text: with his DUFFEL BAG, looking at the dingy wood-slat room.
text: He sets his bag down (with an audible clink! of gunmetal
text: inside) and slowly approaches the BED. She watches as...
text: He draws back the covers, bends low, and BREATHES in deeply
text: the scent of the sheets. After a beat...he turns back to her.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: The Indian Hunter?
text: Something wild in his eyes makes her swallow.
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED MINING CAMP —- NIGHT
text: LOOKING UP the slope of the valley wall to a CAVE MOUTH:
text: animal-skin curtains and FIRELIGHT shimmering inside.
text: TILT DOWN to find SLONE hiking steadily up towards it.
scene_heading: INT. HUNTER JOHN’S CAVE - NIGHT
text: HUNTER JOHN (60s) looks up from a steaming stew pot, grinning
text: in welcome. Imp-eyed, skeletal and bald with a beard to his
text: chest, dressed all in animal skins.
text: Slone enters, stooping low and unzipping his coat in the
text: claustrophobic warmth of several smoking braziers. It’s
text: packed with stuff: bear skins and hunting rifles, folk art
text: and motor parts, old National Geographics and Playboys.
text: And MASKS. Dozens, various crude ANIMAL FACES of wood and
text: cloth and pelt, displayed on the wall. Slone sees them.
speaker_heading: HUNTER JOHN
dialog: Come eat.
text: He ladles up a second bowl for Slone, offers a spot to sit.
text: Slone takes a bite, watches Hunter John slurp the broth.
dialog: Eventually...
speaker_heading: HUNTER JOHN (CONT’D)
dialog: She knows you’re coming for her.
dialog: She told me what she did, too.
dialog: That’s why she came to me. For
dialog: counsel. She had one of my masks. I
dialog: don’t know how she got it. I share
dialog: them with travelers and they find
dialog: their way to who needs them.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: You let her go from here.
speaker_heading: HUNTER JOHN
dialog: Not my business what she did.
dialog: There’s no decree in the country.
dialog: It don’t reach here. I help who
text: comes asking.
text: He peers across at Slone, a small knowing smile.
speaker_heading: HUNTER JOHN (CONT’D)
dialog: I remember you, traveler. Just a
dialog: little tyke last time you were
dialog: here. All that yellow hair?
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Why did we come?
speaker_heading: HUNTER JOHN
dialog: To see me. Your father wanted
dialog: wolf’s oil. It was for you. Did you
dialog: know that? He said you were
dialog: unnatural. That was his word. An
dialog: Indian witch from his village said
dialog: wolf’s oil could cure you. Did it
dialog: work? I gave him the oil.
text: Slone stares at him. He--what? For just an instant there it
text: looked as if he might shed tears. He clears his throat.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: (so soft)
dialog: Where did she go?
speaker_heading: HUNTER JOHN
dialog: Not my business. I traded her my
dialog: truck and I’d say I got the better
dialog: deal. Fixed her up with some boots
dialog: I'd made. She left her mask,
dialog: though.
text: Hunter John gestures vaguely with his spoon into a corner.
speaker_heading: HUNTER JOHN (CONT’D)
dialog: You're welcome to it, boy.
text: As Slone looks back and RISES OUT OF FRAME, Hunter John
text: returns his attention to his meal...
speaker_heading: HUNTER JOHN (CONT’D)
dialog: When was the last time you wore a
dialog: mask? I can see you need to let the
dialog: wolf out a little. We all do, out
dialog: here. It’s truth.
text: Hunter John looks up to see Slone, hunched beneath the low
text: cave roof with his back to him.
text: But turning slowly around now...with MEDORA’S WOLF MASK on
text: his face and the 9MM PISTOL in his hand.
text: They stare at each other in flickering firelight.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED MINING CAMP —- NIGHT
text: LOOKING UP AT THE CAVE as--bang.bang.--GUNSHOTS ECHO from the
text: dancing light within and wash down over the camp.
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: INT. INN - NIGHT
text: The Innkeeper looks up from a magazine, hearing the shots.
scene_heading: EXT. HUNTER JOHN’S CAVE - NIGHT
text: Slone-as-Wolf emerges, his eyes black pits in the mask, an
text: OUT OF CONTROL FIRE JUMPING TO LIFE IN THE CAVE BEHIND HIM.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - ABANDONED MINING CAMP - NIGHT
text: Slone-as-Wolf stalks towards the INN, the gun in his hand, a
text: DISTANT FIRE blazing in the cliffside high above him.
text: He nears the INN, raising the GUN as he PASSES HIS 4x4 when--
scene_heading: BAM. WINDOW GLASS EXPLODES AND SLONE BUCKLES: HE’S HIT.
text: THE INNKEEPER STEPS FROM BEHIND THE INN, AIMING A RIFLE ON
scene_heading: HIM, HER EYES WILD WITH FEAR. BAM. BAM. BAM.
text: SLONE WRIGGLES INTO THE TRUCK AS BULLETS PUNCH ITS DOORS AND
scene_heading: GLASS SPRAYS HIS FACE. BAM. BAM. BAM.
scene_heading: THE INNKEEPER ADVANCES, FIRING ON THE 4X4 AS--
text: INSIDE IT, Slone fumbles the keys into the ignition with
text: BLOODY FINGERS and grinds the starter--KRRR!
text: OUTSIDE, THE INNKEEPER STEPS INTO THE ROAD, FIRING ON THE 4x4
text: AS IT FISHTAILS AWAY FROM HER IN GREAT TWIN-GEYSERS OF SNOW.
scene_heading: BAM. BAM. BAM.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN —- MARIUM HOME - NIGHT
text: Susan prepares a plate at the stove: spaghetti and sauce and
text: bread. She brings it over and sets it down for...
text: Marium, waiting at the table with his hands steepled before
text: his face. Band-Aids on his face. Sunken. Haunted.
text: She joins him with her own plate, eyeing him, concerned but
text: understanding. Oh, he notices his food there.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: ...thank you...
text: She touches his hand. He gives her a frail, phony smile.
dialog: 81.
text: She frowns at that, don’t, and he lets the smile go. Lets her
text: see the grief in his face. Holds her hand tightly.
text: A moment like that and then they both look up to...
text: Core, returning to his plate, carefully replacing his napkin
text: in his lap. He looks a shell of himself, utterly depleted.
text: Susan reaches for the bottle of wine, gestures to pour him
text: some. Core hesitates then slides his glass over with a nod.
text: He takes a sip, looks around at this modest, new-model house.
text: Cream-colored paint and particle-board cabinets.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Your home is lovely.
text: Susan smiles but it doesn’t quite reach her eyes.
text: They eat. Utensils clink on plates.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Donald says you're a writer.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I write. Yes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What kinds of stories?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I write about nature. I’m not sure
dialog: if that’s a story.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Is it fulfilling?
text: She was maybe asking to be polite but Core stares intensely
text: down into his plate, like the truth might be hidden there.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: You do a thing and...at some point
dialog: that’s what you are. I don’t know
dialog: if that’s the same. But I loved
dialog: wolves very much. I used to study
dialog: them. Lived with them for a time.
dialog: Near them, anyway.
dialog: (he’s seeing them now)
dialog: They were very beautiful.
text: Marium looks up from his food, glances at Susan: this naked
text: emotion is awkward at the dinner table.
text: Core realizes this, is embarrassed.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: (gesturing, your baby)
dialog: Um. How much longer do you have?
text: Susan can’t help but to smile, touching her big belly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: February.
text: Core smiles in a vague and longing kind of way.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Almost here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you know what you’re having?
text: She shakes her head, adding...
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He wants a boy though.
text: Now Marium can’t help but to smile.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: No, a girl is good, too. A fogey
dialog: like me having his first kid?
dialog: Anything is fine.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: What are you...forty?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Forty three.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: “Fogey.” Hah. I’1l trade with you.
text: A beat, the two men regarding each other, Susan watching.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Are you a father?
text: Core blinks. Swallows hard.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What’s his name? Her name?
text: Core swallows. Just saying it breaks his heart...
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: (very quiet)
dialog: Amy.
text: Marium refills Core’s glass, then Susan’s, then his own.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: What’s it like?
dialog: He considers his answer...
dialog: He shrugs,
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Amazing. I wish I’d understood that
dialog: better at the time. I think I
dialog: thought she would love me by nature
dialog: of that fact that I existed. That
dialog: that would be enough, without being
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You traveled for your work.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: When I was younger, yes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That was for her. To make money for
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: There are ways to make money that
dialog: don’t involve being apart from your
dialog: family. But even later, when I was
dialog: at home...I still wasn’t there. In
dialog: my little room across the hall, you
dialog: know? Doing my work.
text: his eyes shining.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: And when she had troubles, y’know,
dialog: like young people do, I uh...I
dialog: guess I wasn’t much help.
text: He has a sip of wine. Lets it settle.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: You like to think you're devoted to
dialog: your child. You say this to people.
dialog: ‘I would do anything for her.
dialog: Anything.’ And it feels correct in
dialog: your mouth when you say it. But
dialog: then...you go ahead with your life.
dialog: 84.
text: Susan doesn’t know what to say. The phone RINGS, once, twice,
text: and on three Marium finally gets up to answer in the kitchen.
text: We can hear him MURMURING in there. Core and Susan sit in
text: silence. Her fork clinks on her plate.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MARIUM HOME - SAME
text: Marium nods into the phone, leaning one-handed against the
text: wall like some great weight is pulling him down by the neck.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Right. Okay. Yeah.
text: He hangs up, grips his forehead, exhales.
text: When he opens his eyes, Core is standing in the doorway with
text: the empty wine bottle, waiting for the news.
text: Marium gestures at the phone, troubled...
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: County a few hours east of here.
dialog: A man in a mining camp was killed
dialog: tonight. Some recluse, sounds like.
dialog: Witness spoke to the killer and
dialog: described Vernon Slone perfectly.
dialog: She uh...she said he wore a wolf
dialog: mask.
text: Core sets the empty bottle on the counter. Chnk.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Now what?

speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: But if we can’t get ahead of him,
dialog: more people are gonna die.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - SHAD’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A PERCOCET PILL is crushed beneath a dollar with a lighter.
text: SHAN MARTIN (35) chops it, snorts it. He’s doughy, dull-eyed,
dialog: smeared with bad tattoos. His house is filthy: you can smell
text: the bong water and cat piss. Abrasive METAL on the CD player.
dialog: 85.
text: ON THE MUTED TV: a solemn REPORTER outside of Cheeon’s house,
text: COPS and AMBULANCES all over. Chyron: Massacre In Keelut.
text: Shan watches in stoned disbelief.
text: ON THE TV: a MUG SHOT OF CHEEON (several years old) becomes
text: SLONE’S SERVICE PHOTO with a POLICE HOTLINE NUMBER below it.
text: Shan lights a cigarette, astonished.
text: Tkk. A noise from somewhere else. He looks. TKK.
text: He gets up, cuts the music off (the BUZZ of the space heater
text: now the only sound in here) and listens. Freaked out.
text: He stubs out his smoke.
scene_heading: INT. UTILITY ROOM - SAME
text: The overhead bulb clicks on and Shan creeps through this
text: chilly room (his breath already fogging) for wash sinks and
text: mop buckets. He’s got a BASEBALL BAT cocked back.
text: He unlocks the DOUBLE DEADBOLT on the door there and STEPS
text: INTO TOTAL DARKNESS...
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: .--which, click!, suddenly reveals itself to be a TWIN BAY
text: AUTO GARAGE as he hits the lights. The wind outside WHISTLES.
text: He edges anxiously past shelves of tools and spray cans and
text: junk parts, a half-tarped SNOWMOBILE and a TRUCK covered in
dialog: rock n’ roll stickers, until--
text: He nears something, his face bunching in confusion.
text: THE DOOR is opened just half an inch, bumping with the wind
text: outside. The LATCH HOUSING is broken, forced apart.
text: ON SHAN, gaping at it as we realize SOMEONE ELSE IS HERE.
text: He whirls, gasping, almost dropping the bat because--
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: Jeezchrist!
text: Slone is slouched in the corner, barely conscious, one BLOODY
text: HAND clutching his BLOOD-SOAKED SHOULDER.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Goddamn, Vern. Been a while.
dialog: (glancing to the door)
dialog: Broke my door, huh?
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: You alone here?
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: What? Yeah. Shelly moved out a
dialog: while back. It’s just us.
text: Slone nods, almost dozes but struggles back into focus--
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: I need your help.
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: Y-yeah. Sure thing.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Get Cheeon for me.
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: Cheeon? The fuck you been, man?
text: Slone reads the grim meaning in that.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SHAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: SLONE, shirtless on the bed, on his stomach, facing clammily
dialog: into camera while...
text: IN THE BACKGROUND, Shan busies back and forth.
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: I’m sorry, man. I know you boys
dialog: were tight. Cheeon never did like
dialog: cops, did he? Made himself a real
text: bloodbath up there. Goddamn.
text: Shan crosses, collecting things. Drawers and cabinets slam.
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: And the other thing...uh. They said
dialog: it on the news. Bailey. Just a
dialog: fucking nightmare, man. Just
dialog: senseless. Medora. Fuck.
text: Slone blinks, lizard-like.
text: AT THE BATHROOM SINK, Shan scrubs a pair of NEEDLE-NOSE
text: PLIERS with a wire brush and greasecutter.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: So who shot you?
speaker_heading: SLONE
text: A woman.
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: Shit...who ain’t been shot by a
dialog: woman?
text: A BOTTLE OF VODKA is set on the bedside table. And two
text: PERCOCETS. Some WASHCLOTHS, an X-ACTO BLADE, a soup pan of
speaker_heading: HOT WATER.
text: Slone winces as Shan kneels beside him, inspecting--
text: THE BULLET HOLE IN SLONE’S SHOULDER. The bleeding has slowed,
text: more of a sluggish ooze now, but it’s deep and chewed open.
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Jesus, this go through something
dialog: first?
speaker_heading: SLONE
text: A truck.
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: Yeah. Looks like it came apart,
dialog: alright. Probably why you're still
dialog: breathing.
text: Shan swigs the vodka, then holds it near Slone’s hand...
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Pull on this. And take those. It’s
dialog: gonna hurt like a motherfucker.
text: Edging painfully up onto his elbow, Slone palms the pills
text: into his mouth and glugs the bottle. As he eases back down...
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t worry, Vern. I done this a
dialog: million times. Get you cleaned up,
dialog: get some hot soup in you and--
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: What kind?
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: What kind of soup?
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: Campbell’s chicken.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: I like tomato.
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: You been fucking shot, man. ‘I like
dialog: tomato.’ Jesus Christ.
text: Shaking his head at that, Shan bends in with the X-ACTO BLADE
text: to start his work and SLONE BUCKLES IN WHITE-HOT AGONY.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MARIUM HOME - NIGHT
text: Susan lays curled on her side as Marium draws her covers up.
text: Bends low to kiss her on the cheek, gently strokes her hair.
text: She looks at him with a serious kind of adoration.
text: She whispers something to him that we cannot hear.
text: He smiles and whispers something back.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MARIUM HOME - NIGHT
text: As Marium backs out of the bedroom, quietly closing the door
text: on the darkened room, he pauses, hearing...
text: A faint CLINKING of dishes from elsewhere in the house.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
text: Marium appears in the doorway, seeing that--
text: Core is washing the dishes. Trying to be quiet about it.
text: Marium joins him, pours TWO GLASSES of whiskey, hands one to
text: Core. They clink glasses, not merrily, and drink.
text: And then Marium starts to dry the dishes, put them away as
text: Core rinses them. As they work...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Have you ever seen anything like
dialog: that today?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I kicked in a meth lab, few years
dialog: ago. Guy took a coupla pops at me
text: with a .22, a purse gun. Sounded
dialog: like bubble wrap. He was as close
dialog: to me as you are and missed every
dialog: shot. Scariest moment of my entire
dialog: life.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No. I have never seen anything like
dialog: that today.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: You handled yourself.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: I gave him what he wanted.
text: The dishes are done. They lean there and drink, exhausted.
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: Why did you stop? With the wolves,
dialog: I mean.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Oh. There were...people...
dialog: (He practically spits that word out.)
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: They came onto the reservation. To
dialog: camp. They brought their infant
dialog: with them. Ten months old. They
dialog: drank champagne and fell asleep.
dialog: There was a wolf, she was starving,
text: and she came into the tent.
text: Marium listens in stillness. Core’s eyes are elsewhere.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: The authorities, they...well. I was
dialog: hired to do it and I did it. I
dialog: think I felt like, better it was me
dialog: than some policeman in a
dialog: helicopter.
text: Their eyes meet and hold.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: Slone killed the old woman.
text: Marium nods.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Knives aren’t Cheeon’s style. It
dialog: was Slone.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: And the coroner? Those policemen?
dialog: Now this hermit tonight?
text: He nods again.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Depending how this all shakes out
dialog: we might never know for sure but,
dialog: yes, I believe so.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Why?
text: Marium moves his hand, a mystified gesture.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Stop us from getting to Medora
text: first. Or to get at the boy’s body.
dialog: Or maybe he’s just evil. I can’t
dialog: presume to know what’s in Vernon
dialog: Slone’s head. Why any of it?
dialog: Why'd Medora do what she did? I’m
dialog: not convinced the answers exist.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: They do. Whether or not they can
dialog: fit with our experience is
dialog: something else.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I’m not a cop.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: You deal in behavior. Only
dialog: difference is the piece of tin.
text: Core snorts, shakes his head. But then grows serious,
dialog: thoughtful...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: She said things to me. She’d been
text: left alone with him. He was wrong,
dialog: she said. It was like she wanted to
dialog: fix him. Save him. I don’t know.
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Save him by destroying him?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: It happens in medicine.
dialog: Chemotherapy.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: This isn’t chemotherapy. This is a
dialog: little boy. Save him from what?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: The dark.
text: Marium frowns. Waits for more.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
text: In her. In him. Outside her window.
dialog: She told me about it but I uh...I
dialog: wasn’t listening.
text: Core kills his drink, stares into the empty glass...
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: I think that’s why she wrote me. It
dialog: was already done by then but I
dialog: think she wanted a witness to her
dialog: life. To tell her story. And I
dialog: think she wanted to be punished.
text: Marium considers this, tops off his glass, and as he tops off
dialog: Core’s...
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Well, you’re the story guy. But for
dialog: the other part all she needed was
dialog: to wait for Vern. And if he finds
dialog: her before we do, she’1ll damn sure
dialog: get her wish.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I want to go home, Detective
dialog: Marium.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Donald. And you’re free to leave
dialog: anytime.
text: Marium stares out the dark window, mystified.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: I swear to God...soon as this is
dialog: over I’m taking Susan on a beach
dialog: vacation. Caribbean, someplace, hot
text: sand and green water.
text: He takes a slow sip, turns back, and sees that...
text: Core is looking at him with an expression of lightning
dialog: realization: oh my God.
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: “Good place to get clean.”
scene_heading: INT. DEN - MARIUM HOME - NIGHT
text: MOVING OVER A TOPO MAP, elevation marks, dark smudges of
text: forest, dots with names. There’s Keelut.
text: Core frowns at the map on the table, wracking his brain.
text: Marium watches, waiting, desperately hopeful. But finally...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I don’t know, I can’t tell from
dialog: this. It was north of Keelut but...
dialog: I’m not sure how long I’d been
dialog: walking. Time was strange.
text: Marium deflates, his hopes dashed...but he presses it--
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Look, if there’s even a chance...if
dialog: we can find her, it might be as
dialog: good as finding him.
text: Something flickers across Core’s face, some kind of decision,
text: and he looks at Marium with a new, anxious kind of resolve...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I'd know it if I saw it again.
text: Hearing that, Marium’s fire starts to return.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOT SPRING - DAY
text: SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON THE STEAMING CAVE MOUTH, with that
text: CIRCLE OF DARK SNOWLESS GROUND spreading before it.
dialog: 93.
text: TWO PEOPLE enter frame, seen from behind, hiking towards the
text: cave with BACKPACKS and COLD WEATHER GEAR.
text: They pause, regarding this odd sight on a bright sunny day.
text: It’s Slone and Medora. They look so much younger, out of
text: breath but energized. They look happy. It’s some other time.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: Is that it?
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: Hurry.
text: They continue up towards the cave.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOT SPRING - DAY
text: Steamy air and slick, craggy rock. Echoing FOOTSTEPS as...
text: Medora leads Slone by the hand, out of the sunlight behind
dialog: them, into this warm dimness.
text: They drop their packs, unzip their heavy coats, remove their
text: fur-lined hats.
text: CANDLES are brought from a pack, arranged and lit.
text: In the soft dancing light, Medora peels out of her clothes,
dialog: watching as...
text: Slone peels out of his clothes and comes towards her,
dialog: smiling. As gentle as we’ve ever seen this man, like another
dialog: person entirely.
text: They embrace at the edge of a STEAMING HOT SPRING, a deep
text: pool of calm black water, rippling with candlelight.
text: They kiss, hungrily, their reflections upside-down and
text: shattering endlessly on the water’s surface.
text: Medora reaches down between his legs, he reaches down between
text: hers. They claw at each other, panting and pressing.
text: Entwined, they descend into the water.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: We'll stay here forever. In this
dialog: place.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: I’ll never leave you.
text: SLOWLY PULLING AWAY from their coupling as the steam catches
text: candlelight in eerie ways, softly splashing water and throat
dialog: sounds echoing together as--
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SHAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: SLONE’S EYES SNAP AWAKE. The lights are off but we can see
text: the fresh wad of BANDAGE on his shoulder as he sits up.
text: Even in darkness we see it on his face: I know where she is.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - SHAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON SHAN, anxiously dragging on a smoke as he whispers
dialog: into the phone--
speaker_heading: SHAN
dialog: I’m saying he’s right here, right
dialog: now, in my house. What? No, he’s
dialog: passed out but I don’t know for how
dialog: much longer so get your people out
dialog: here pronto and I want that special
dialog: consideration--huh? What do you
dialog: mean, weapons? No, there’s no guns
dialog: but he’s carrying one big ass
dialog: knife...
text: THE PHONE CORD is plucked from its wall socket.
text: Mid-sentence, Shan hears the line go dead and turns to see--
text: SLONE-AS-WOLF in the doorway, shirtless, mask-faced, dropping
text: the phone cord, the BOWIE KNIFE clutched in his fist.
text: At first, Shan tries to play it off...
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Hell’d you get that thing? Go lay
dialog: down, you'll start bleeding again.
text: Slone-As-Wolf steps in, black eye sockets locked on Shan.
text: Shan’s mouth hangs open, lowering the phone.
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m in trouble, man. It’s those
dialog: pills, I’m fucked up. They got me,
dialog: I'm looking at real time.
dialog: 95.
text: Slone-As-Wolf moves closer. Shan pleads with his hands--
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: But I was gonna wake you up, get
dialog: you outta here before they showed
dialog: up! I swear. I’d get my good
dialog: citizen points, you’d be gone, no
dialog: harm done!
text: Shan backs and slides. Slone-As-Wolf moves closer.
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: C’mon, motherfucker, I just saved
dialog: your life! You show up here like
dialog: this? After what you done? Asked
dialog: for help and I helped you!
text: Shan’s against the wall and prays his hands together.
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Please, Vern. Please. We been
dialog: knowin’ each other since we were
dialog: kids.
text: But Slone-As-Wolf says nothing, almost in arm’s reach now.
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: FUCK YOU, THEN! FUCK YOU!
scene_heading: SHAN GRABS AN ASHTRAY, HURLS IT BUT--—
scene_heading: SLONE-AS-WOLF SLAPS IT ASIDE, SWINGS THE BOWIE KNIFE IN A
scene_heading: HAYMAKER DIRECTLY INTO SHAN’S TEMPLE--POK.--UP TO THE HILT.
speaker_heading: SHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: «..Vern...
text: Shan goes limp as a dishrag but SLONE-AS-WOLF KEEPS HIM
text: UPRIGHT BY THE KNIFE IN HIS SKULL, powering him across the
text: room like a busted marionette.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: IN BLACKNESS, the THRUM of immense atmospheric chaos mixes
text: with URGENT, BOTTOM-REGISTER MUSIC that carries over...
scene_heading: EXT. DENALI - PRE-DAWN
text: A STORM GATHERS OVER THE MOUNTAIN, a roiling steel-colored
text: halo forming around the highest summit in North America.
text: Unreal in its hugeness. The sky crackles with dark energy.
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: EXT. AIR STRIP - DAWN
text: SLONE’S BOOTS stride mechanically forward.
text: But of course it’s Core wearing them. He and Marium, side by
text: side in heavy outdoor gear, come briskly down the TARMAC.
dialog: They see:
text: A SMALL PLANE taking off, ANOTHER ONE already taxiing into
text: position. Tense COPS visible in the windows. COPS in weather
text: gear jogging by in the background. Full deployment.
text: Up ahead, there’s a cluster of STATE POLICE CARS, where some
text: older RANKING OFFICERS are waving Marium over.
text: As Marium jogs ahead to confer with those men--
text: A STIFF WIND BLOWS, Core turns into it and blinks in awe at--
text: DENALI, a black mass at once distant and enormous, swelling
text: out of the horizon line, conjuring a STORM to its peak.
text: He is hypnotized, swaying.
text: Marium comes jogging back, pointing Core off towards a--
text: TWO-SEATER CESSNA PROP PLANE, waiting nearby, with just a few
text: AIRPORT WORKERS buzzing about it but no police.
text: Core joins him, glancing around, realizing...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Just us?
text: As Marium loads his gear, moving urgently--
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: An old KA of Slone’s was found this
dialog: morning with a mail slot through
text: his skull. Half the men are working
dialog: that, the rest are assisting the
dialog: camp search so I’m afraid, yeah,
dialog: it’s just us. You eyeball it, I’'11
dialog: call it in.
text: Marium climbs into the plane, checking controls and slipping
text: on the headset with practiced familiarity.
text: He looks out to Core as he starts the engine, VRR-RRR-RRMM!
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: (shouting over the noise)
dialog: Besides...only two seats in this
dialog: sucker!
dialog: 97.
text: Suddenly dizzy, Core stares at the mountain, gulping deep
dialog: breaths.
text: With the deafening ENGINE NOISE between them, Marium gives
dialog: him a questioning look. You ready?
text: Core nods, Yes. It’s a lie. He climbs into the plane anyway.
text: The MUSIC is a dread-fueled, ramming-speed wall of sound.
scene_heading: EXT. TARMAC - DAY
text: TRACKING THE CESSNA as it speeds down the runway and, as if
text: plucked up by some invisible giant, gently leaves the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. AERIAL - DAY
text: The MUSIC crescendos into a teeth-rattling doooooom as...
text: THE CESSNA FLIES TOWARDS DENALI. Though it’s maybe fifty
text: miles away, the plane looks like an insect before a great
text: dark ziggurat. The sky all around is swollen and evil.
scene_heading: INT. CESSNA (FLYING) - SAME
text: Core gapes at the storm gathering off the mountain...
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: (headset filtered)
dialog: Locals call it Weathermaker.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: (also)
dialog: McKinley?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Denali. Please. You Lower 48ers...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Can we beat that storm?
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: We'll get out of its way.
text: But Marium glances out the window and maybe isn’t all that
text: confident. He urges the throttle up and--
dialog: 98.
scene_heading: EXT. AERIAL —- SAME
text: BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE CESSNA AT 500 FEET, moving parallel to
text: a thin stripe of ROAD cutting through the WHITENESS BELOW--
text: --but now VEERING OFF TO THE RIGHT, the road disappearing
text: beneath them, no more man-made landmarks of any kind.
scene_heading: INT. KEELUT - DAY
text: THE WHITE HAIRED YUP’IK MAN (we saw him earlier, with his
text: boy, returning from a hunt) is readying his SNOWMOBILE when--
text: VRRRRRM. He looks up to see the CESSNA pass over him at low
text: altitude, vanishing as quickly as it appeared.
scene_heading: INT. CESSNA (FLYING) - SAME
text: Marium flies in the weird half-light, the increasing cloud
text: cover making for a kind of morning dusk.
text: Core peers out the window through binoculars, scanning the
dialog: ground. He gestures to Marium, That way.
text: Marium banks the aircraft.
scene_heading: EXT. AERIAL - SAME
text: THE CESSNA FLIES LOW OVER WILDERNESS, a windy stretch we
text: might recognize from Core’s trek earlier.
scene_heading: INT. CESSNA (FLYING) - SAME
text: Looking through the binoculars, Core suddenly straightens--
text: CORE’S POV passes over an incongruous BLACK RECTANGLE with
text: man-made angles, down there in the whiteness.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I think that was a snow machine.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Moving?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: See anyone?
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I’m gonna loop back--
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Wait--
text: Core lowers the binoculars, eyes fixed on a near point
text: outside the window. He taps the glass--
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: There. Beyond that ridge.
text: OUT THE RIGHT WINDOW, distant but plainly visible within a
text: LOW FLATNESS surrounded by WOODED RIDGES and CRAGGY CLIFFS...
text: ...there is an almost perfect CIRCLE OF DARK SNOWLESS GROUND
text: with a thread of STEAM bending upwards from its center.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s it.
text: Marium looks, sees it, gauges the terrain...
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: I can set us down over there.
text: He said it like an offer, a possibility. He looks to Core...
text: Who is terrified. But he nods. Do it.
speaker_heading: MARIUM (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ll be gentle.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Fuck.
text: Marium banks it hard.
scene_heading: EXT. AERIAL —- SAME
text: THE CESSNA CURVES AROUND, ANGLES DOWN TOWARDS THE FLATNESS.
scene_heading: INT. CESSNA (FLYING) - SAME
text: Core grips his straps two-handed, wincing away from the
text: inevitable crash as Marium guides them in--
dialog: 100.
scene_heading: EXT. FLATNESS - SAME
text: THE CESSNA GLIDES GRACEFULLY DOWN TO THE GROUND UNTIL--KAM!--
text: THE BRUTAL LANDING CONTACT VIOLENTLY JERKS THE WINGSPAN.
scene_heading: INT. CESSNA (MOVING) - SAME
text: WAM! Core is SLAMMED into the window as Marium PULLS BACK--
scene_heading: EXT. FLATNESS - SAME
text: THE CESSNA BRODIES, SHEARS UP A MASSIVE WAVE OF SNOW, SLIDES
text: TO A LONG GROANING HALT.
text: And the PROPELLER winds down, wak-wak-wak-wak-wak-wak...
scene_heading: EXT. FLATNESS - DAY
text: Marium cinches the strap of his SCOPED WEATHERBY RIFLE over
text: his thick ORANGE COAT, brings up his BINOCULARS, scans the
dialog: landscape.
text: MARIUM’S POV, the icy FLATNESS extending to craggy RIDGES and
text: CLIFFS in the distance, the telltale STEAM rising beyond.
text: He looks over to...
text: Core, climbing out of the Cessna and tromping this way.
text: Marium digs into his pocket, hands something to him as he
dialog: arrives...
text: It’s a pair of CHARCOAL POCKET WARMERS. Core nods in thanks,
text: snaps them and slips them inside his gloves.
text: WIDE on the TWO MEN hiking away from the Cessna, across the
text: plain of pure white as the sky turns to slate above them.
text: Far away, THUNDER rumbles.
scene_heading: EXT. RAVINE - DAY
text: Rock walls tower over us, left and right, as Marium and Core
text: appear at the far end and come this way.
text: ICE SHEETS cascade down either side, glittering in some
text: places, opaque in others, like waterfalls stopped in time.
text: Core marvels up at them, towering over their heads, a stripe
text: of sky visible up there.
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: EXT. BELOW A RIDGE - DAY
text: They emerge from the ravine, a ROCKY RIDGE rising to one
text: side, DENSE WOODS spreading to the other. Suddenly...
text: Core stops, bends to looking down at something.
text: Marium senses it, looks back to see the--
text: WOLF TRACKS, several sets of them spotting the snow.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: How fresh are they?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: An hour or two, I'd say. Four of
dialog: them, adults. A hundred pounds
dialog: apiece, give or take.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Four. Where’s the rest of the pack?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Not far, I’d guess. Their den must
dialog: be nearby.
text: They glance about uneasily, ahead of and behind them.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: Little bit further?
text: Core’s eyes are ringed with fear but...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: We see anything...we’1ll turn back,
dialog: call it in.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Right.
text: They crunch onwards towards the woods.
text: A gust of SNOWY WIND stirs a sparkling whiteness around them.
text: Core glances over his shoulder, the RAVINE receding behind
text: them like a sideways mouth.
text: He looks upwards, the crooked edge of the RIDGE above them...
text: Something moves up there. A dark wisp, a split-second blur.
dialog: 102.
text: Core stops, staring up, his breath fogging slowly. He brings
text: out his own BINOCULARS, squints through them...
text: Marium stops, looks back.
speaker_heading: MARIUM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I saw something move.
text: Marium looks up in the same direction.
text: A long beat, the two of them side by side, looking up at the
text: ridge. The WIND makes its faint flute-noise.
text: CORE’S BINOCULAR POV, panning along the ridge, pausing at
dialog: various places, seeing nothing...and nothing...and nothing...
text: And then seeing Slone-As-Wolf, standing on the ridge, looking
text: down at them with his bowstring already drawn back.
text: He lets the bowstring go and in CORE’S BINOCULAR POV it’s
text: perfectly silent, just the slightest twitch of movement.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: He's--
text: There is a sound like HANDCLAP and when Core looks over--
text: Marium is taking a single shocked step backwards with AN
text: ARROW STICKING THROUGH HIS THROAT.
text: Core gapes in horror as--
text: Marium flutters his hands around the shaft of the arrow, like
text: swatting at flies, BLOOD GURGLING OUT OF HIS MOUTH.
text: Core pulls him down to some kind of safety behind some ROCKS,
text: throwing his own body of Marium’s, trying to press his gloves
dialog: over the wound...
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: Donald.
text: But Marium’s already dead, his eyes fixed and startled.
text: Panting in terror, Core peeks over the rocks but--
text: UP ON THE RIDGE, there is no sight of Slone or anything else.
text: Core wrestles the RIFLE from Marium’s shoulder and...
text: HE RUNS, awkwardly, bounding over snowy ground towards--
dialog: 103.
text: THE RAVINE, yawning ahead of him.
scene_heading: EXT. RAVINE - SAME
text: Core hurtles through the passage, caroming off the icy walls,
text: his RASPY BREATHING making surreal echoes in here.
scene_heading: EXT. FLATNESS - SAME
text: WIDE, the small shape of Core dashes back towards the plane.
text: AT THE CESSNA, Core arrives gasping, a MOAN of despair
text: leaking out of him as he sees...
text: THE ENGINE HOUSING has been opened, the cables and plugs
text: inside torn loose.
text: He peers inside the opened door to see...
text: THE CONTROL PANEL has been hacked apart, INSTRUMENTS
text: smashed...and the RADIO WIRES have been cut.
text: He SCREAMS, an explosion of fury and frustration and despair.
text: He sags against the ruined plane a moment, then notices--
text: MARIUM’S DUFFEL, tucked under the pilot’s seat. He yanks it
text: out, paws it open, pitifully hopeful but...
text: It’s just some SOCKS. And a pint of WHISKEY. And a dog-eared
text: BOOK. Core turns it over...
text: ‘Preparing For Fatherhood.’ Core lets it drop back into the
text: bag and instead grabs the booze, swallows several gulps.
text: He looks to the far side of the flatness, where they flew in,
text: the STORM filling the sky there, threateningly close.
text: And he looks back the other way, towards the ravine, where he
dialog: just came from.
text: Core stares off, his eyes gone totally empty, off in some
dialog: bleak daydream. And then...
text: He has a final pull of whiskey. He checks the bolt of the
dialog: rifle, ch-chk!
text: And he starts back towards the ravine.
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: EXT. RAVINE - DAY
text: Core comes towards us, the rifle to his shoulder, aimed
text: forward. Terrified but moving at a steady, determined pace.
scene_heading: EXT. BELOW THE RIDGE - DAY
text: MARIUM’S BODY lays ahead, already frosting over. The pool of
text: blood under his neck is red ice.
text: As Core passes by, there is a HOWLING nearby, several wolf
text: voices joining with the shrill wind.
text: He glances up but...
text: UP ON THE RIDGE, there is no movement, no sign of anyone.
dialog: He continues.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOT SPRING - DAY
text: THE STEAMING CAVE MOUTH looms ahead as...
text: Core enters the clearing, scanning left and right with the
text: rifle, approaching that strange dark spot in the Earth.
text: More HOWLING, closer now.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOT SPRING - SAME
text: Core’s silhouette appears in the cave opening, bending to
dialog: come inside.
text: He blinks rapidly, edging forward, trying to adjust his eyes.
text: There’s that WAXY SUBSTANCE in the cracks of the floor. His
text: eyes track it back, deeper into the cave until he sees...
text: SOME LIT CANDLES. Flickering in the cold breeze.
text: And A FIRE CIRCLE, just ashes now, with the toothpick bones
text: of a HARE scattered beside it.
text: He sees CANNED FOOD stacked to one side, a dirty SLEEPING
text: ROLL, a small .22 RIFLE. It was Bailey’s once, wasn’t it?
text: He sees a PAIR OF PELT BOOTS standing next to the HOT
text: POOL...and then realizes that they’re connected to legs.
text: She's barely visible in the dimness. Just a shape there, but
text: he can hear her BREATHING.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Medora Slone.
text: She doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you injured?
text: She takes a step forward, closer to the light. Now he can see
text: her: dressed in animal skins, her sunken cheeks, her filthy
text: skin and wild hair and bright, shining eyes.
speaker_heading: CORE (CONT’D)
dialog: Listen to me...we have to leave. We
dialog: have to leave now. He is coming.
dialog: He's coming for you.
text: The light in the cave changes and her face seems to twist as
text: she caws in dread.
dialog: Core turns.
text: Slone-As-Wolf is there, his compound bow drawn back. FWIPT!
scene_heading: THE ARROW PIERCES CORE THROUGH THE COLLAR-BONE, PUNCHES
text: THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE OF HIM.
text: Time and sound turn dreamy as he sinks to his knees, reaching
text: uncertainly for the arrow, afraid to actually touch it.
text: Medora stands there with tears in her eyes.
text: Slone-As-Wolf drops the bow, regarding her through his wolf
text: face, his breath steaming out of the snout.
text: He stalks slowly towards her.
text: She moans but it almost sounds like relief.
text: He steps over Core, who watches from the cave floor as...
text: Medora sobs, opens her arms to Slone, nodding him forward.
dialog: Come to me.
text: Slone reaches out, puts both hands around her throat (she is
dialog: still nodding)...
text: HE LIFTS HER OFF THE GROUND, SLAMS HER AGAINST THE CAVE WALL.
text: Core’s mouth moves soundlessly, wanting to call out but
text: knowing that he’s dying.
text: Slone-As-Wolf pins Medora, his black eye holes empty and
text: pitiless as he squeezes her air off.
dialog: 106.
dialog: And still she nods, Yes, yes, yes.
text: He squeezes. Her mouth wags like a beached fish. Not much
dialog: longer.
text: But then her hands move to his mask, her fingers spidering
text: over the fur, pulling it back to reveal his face...
text: Which is full not of rage...but of bottomless tear-streaked
dialog: anguish.
text: Their faces are inches apart. Their white-blonde hair, their
text: grey-gold eyes.
text: Core sees this. A terrible understanding.
text: She pulls Slone’s face to hers. Puts her mouth on his. They
text: breathe into each other, making animal noises of hurt and
dialog: hunger.
text: She claws at Slone’s clothing. He claws at hers. They sink
text: down together, knocking the CANDLES over as they coil onto
dialog: each other’s bodies.
text: New trickles of SPILLED CANDLE WAX snake across the cave
text: floor, winding past Core’s face.
dialog: He sees this happen as we...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOT SPRING - LATER
text: Core’s eyes open, bleary, pain-fogged. He turns his head...
text: Vernon Slone emerges from the darkness, naked, coming towards
text: Core with something in his hand.
text: In the shadows behind him, we glimpse Medora, watching them
text: as she dresses.
text: Slone stands over Core, looking down without expression.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: ...the...the boots...
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: ...they’re yours...
dialog: 107.
text: Slone kneels beside him, lights the cigarettes in his hand
text: and holds it to Core’s mouth for a drag.
speaker_heading: SLONE
dialog: You keep them.
text: Core inhales, nods gratefully, lets the smoke drizzle out.
text: Slone looks out towards the mouth of the cave, where the
text: FREEZING WIND keens and the LIGHT seems to fade.
text: And he turns his gaze down to Core, questioning but patient.
speaker_heading: SLONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well...what do you want?
text: Core knows what he is asking. His eyes fill with tears.
text: He looks to Medora, who stares back at him in something
text: almost like tenderness.
text: He looks back to Slone...
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
speaker_heading: CORE’S DRIPPING HAND
text: In the bathtub the other night, hovering over the razor.
speaker_heading: RESUME:
text: He swallows painfully. Lifts his head, just a bit, to answer
dialog: with a whispered certainty...
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I'd rather live.
text: Slone nods slowly, accepting Core’s decision. He holds the
dialog: cigarette out to him for one more drag and...
text: SLONE YANKS THE ARROW OUT.
scene_heading: AS CORE SCREAMS WE--
text: CUT TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOT SPRING - LATER
text: Core returns to half-consciousness and sees that Slone is
text: dressed, packing the last of Medora’s provisions.
dialog: 108.
text: Medora is beside him, bundled in layers of skins and furs,
text: lacing up her boots.
text: She notices Core is awake, straightens, looking at him the
text: way a parent looks at a heartbroken child.
speaker_heading: MEDORA
dialog: (softly)
dialog: You understand about the sky now,
dialog: don’t you?
text: He just stares back at her, his non-answer a kind of Yes.
text: They shoulder their packs and the rifle, stand there for a
text: moment, solemnly staring down at Core. And then they walk
text: past him, on out of the cave without another word.
text: Grunting with pain and effort, Core rolls over to see out of
dialog: the CAVE OPENING where...
text: OUT THERE, Slone and Medora walk away together, gradually
text: disappearing into a blast of snowy wind.
scene_heading: EXT. BELOW THE RIDGE - LATER
text: CORE CRAWLS. Snow and wind lash at his face, his beard is
text: caked with ice. He drags himself over the ground with one
text: elbow, his other deadened arm dragging along.
dialog: But it’s a progress of inches. He’s not going to make it out
text: of here. His face is gnarled with the boring agony of it all.
text: He stops, resting his face in the snow, heaving for breath as
text: the weather hammers down on him.
text: And when he finally lifts his head again, he is not at all
dialog: surprised to see...
text: THE WOLVES, all of them, gathered on the ridge above him and
text: gazing down like some kind of council in judgment.
dialog: A quiet moment. Core and these animals.
text: His face is too frozen for much expression...but he is not
text: afraid. If anything, he seems to welcome what will come next.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: SILENCE. And then a strange BUZZING...a motor? Coming closer?
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: EXT. BELOW THE RIDGE - DAY
scene_heading: FRAGMENTED IMAGES, CORE’S HAZY POV:
text: SNOW BLOWS SIDEWAYS and THUNDER RUMBLES.
text: A GOGGLED FACE bends down towards us out of the storm,
dialog: inspecting us. And now we see...
text: A SNOWMOBILE, nearby, where two FIGURES are hauling a DEAD
text: ELK CALF off of the attached SLED.
text: GLOVED HANDS drag us towards this sled.
scene_heading: EXT. SNOWMOBILE (MOVING) - DAY
text: THE ENGINE RUMBLES and Core slides along the ground,
text: bouncing, bundled under a tarp. He cranes his neck to see...
text: It’s the WHITE-HAIRED YUP’IK MAN driving the snowmobile,
text: hunched into the wind, with his BOY riding behind him.
text: As they near the RAVINE, Core catches a brief glimpse of...
text: SCRAPS OF SHREDDED ORANGE COAT IN A SMEAR OF BLOODY SNOW.
text: The Boy looks back, peers at Core through his dark goggles.
text: Says something that can’t be heard over the engine.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: ...what?
speaker_heading: THE BOY
dialog: They spared you.
text: Core lays back, stares up into the churning sky as...
text: THE SNOWMOBILE IS SWALLOWED BY THE RAVINE.
scene_heading: INT. HEALING HUT - SOME OTHER TIME
text: CORE, naked on a cot in some DARK CABIN as SEVERAL YUP’IK
text: WOMEN wash him by firelight.
text: They use plastic water bottles with holes in the caps to
text: squirt water over him, wiping away the blood with sponges.
text: Someone cleans the ARROW WOUND with alcohol, slathers
text: antibiotic ointment on it. Core doesn’t feel it.
text: The fire throws crazy shadows. The air is hazed with smoke.
text: His head tips sideways and he sees...
dialog: 110.
text: AN OLDER BLONDE WOMAN (60s) watching from the corner without
text: expression. She’s tall and gaunt, in a tattered old anorak.
text: Tired _grey-gold eyes. The only other white person here.
text: She comes near, looks wearily down at Core a long moment. And
text: then bends down to pick up...
text: SLONE’S BOOTS, waiting beside the cot with the rest of Core’s
text: blood-soaked clothes.
text: Core watches her turn and leave the cabin, his view of her
text: now obscured by the Yup’ik Women and their cleaning of him.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Clean-shaven now, Core fades back to consciousness,
text: disoriented and weak. Hospital sounds, beeps and murmurs.
text: His lips are chapped and split, the skin of his cheeks pink
text: and flaking, a bruise puffed under one eye. Hurts to swallow.
text: His eyes fall on something and he stares at it for a long,
text: long beat. If he never looked away, that would be fine.
text: A WOMAN (30s), asleep in a chair by his bedside in a holiday
text: sweater and horn-rimmed glasses, a newspaper in her lap.
text: The moment stretches, Core gazing at her in love and sadness.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: Amy.
text: She wakes with a start, sees him, makes a smiling sob sound
text: of relief and concern as she rises and...
text: Kisses him on the cheek. Holds his hand, tightly.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What happened?
text: He’s smiling...but a hint of shadow falls over his face.
speaker_heading: CORE
dialog: I’1l tell you.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: IN BLACKNESS, a WOLF’S HOWL carries from far away, a lone
text: interminable note of sorrow.
speaker_heading: END.
dialog:
