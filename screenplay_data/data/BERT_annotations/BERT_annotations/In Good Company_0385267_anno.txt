speaker_heading: CARTER (cont'd)
dialog: To take it to the next level, we
dialog: need to team up, we need to
dialog: synchronize, we need to synergize!
dialog: We're not alone here. We're not
dialog: alone! We are now part of one of
dialog: the biggest multimedia and brand
dialog: hame companies in the universe.
dialog: Let’s take advantage of that. Did
dialog: you know that one of our sister
dialog: companies makes Krispity Krunch?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So we talk to our brothers and
dialog: sisters at Krispity Krunch, and we
dialog: make a deal to supply Sports
dialog: Factoids for their boxes, so when
text: Joe Couch Potato is snacking, what
dialog: does he see? Sports America
dialog: Krispity Krunch Sports Factoids!
dialog: He's definitely getting more
dialog: Krispity Krunch, and he’s
dialog: definitely not getting Krunch ‘n‘
dialog: Krackle, which looks and tastes
dialog: exactly the same, but has no sports
dialog: Factoids. Krispity Krunch is so
dialog: pleased with the idea that they
dialog: guarantee twenty-six pages a year.
dialog: Besides which, they know Teddy kK.
dialog: Is gonna be pissed if they don’t
dialog: pony up. Bingo -- synergy!
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Isn‘t that cheating?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hell no! And you know what else?
dialog: We also own Starline Cell Phones.
dialog: What do we put on their browser?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Factoids?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yes! Factoids! Synergy! You know
dialog: what else? Box scores! And ads!
dialog: We make a deal where one-hundred
dialog: thousand hits on the internet has
dialog: an equivalent value of one ad page
dialog: in our hard copy.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CARTER (cont'd)
dialog: Are you getting it, people? The

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: An awesome wing man. Well, Carter,
dialog: I can see the benefit to you in
dialog: having an awesome wing man. But
dialog: what's the benefit to me, at this
dialog: point in my career, in being an
dialog: awesome wing man?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Well, one benefit, at this point in

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: ...You‘re sort of a bizarrely

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Not really. Just with you, for

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yeah, frankly I'd rather keep her

speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: So then why’d you agree to it
dialog: without even talking to me? And
dialog: why is your teenage boss here? And

dialog: He called her sugartits.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That idiot. Look, you can't fire
dialog: those guys. These are my guys.
dialog: They‘ve been with me for eight

text: Dan makes his way into the crowd.
speaker_heading: TEDDY K.
dialog: There are vast differences between

text: Steckle shoots Dan a look of DEEP HATRED.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: And I'm not sure I understand how

dialog: selling a product which someone
dialog: hopefully needs, right? We're
dialog: still just human beings, with other
dialog: human beings as customers.
text: Dan picks up steam.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: And I can't see how this company is
dialog: like its own country. I mean, just
dialog: because we sell all different kinds
dialog: of things, that doesn’t mean we
dialog: should operate by our own laws,
dialog: does it? Besides which, countries,
dialog: at least democratic ones, have some
dialog: obligations to their citizens,
dialog: don't they? So how doe layoffs and
