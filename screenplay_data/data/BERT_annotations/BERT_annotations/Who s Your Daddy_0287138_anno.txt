scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY
text: We fly high above heavenly clouds. Beneath a brilliant blue
text: sky. A TEENAGED BOY'S VOICE greets us...
speaker_heading: TED NELSON (V.O.)
dialog: On any given day, your life can
text: change in the blink of an eye.
dialog: It's a cliché, I know...
text: Descending through the clouds, we are caught for a moment in
text: a dreamy gauze. We emerge to find ourselves gliding above a
text: small town. Descending lower. And lower. To Xenia, Ohio.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: ...But a lot of clichés get to be
dialog: clichés because they're true. Your
dialog: life CAN change in the blink of an
dialog: eye. What I mean is, one day
dialog: you're a regular chump, a wannabe
dialog: something. You're not even totally
dialog: sure WHAT you wannabe...
text: We pass over the town square. A fine spring day in middle
text: America. Red brick buildings with names like "Miller & Son
dialog: Drugs," "Two Sisters Gifts," "Nelson Family Market." You
text: can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: ...The next day the doorbell rings
dialog: and some stranger's holding your
text: ticket to being SOMEBODY.
text: Still flying over the town, we focus on a TEENAGED BOY on a
text: Schwinn. We follow as he pedals his way to...
scene_heading: TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL
text: A three story building. Older, brick, sturdy. Meticulously
dialog: maintained.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: It happens every day. Dreams come
dialog: true. And not just for those dim
text: witted chain-smoking hillbillies
dialog: you see on TV. You know, the ones
dialog: who win the Super Lotto and spend
text: their fortune on a truck full of
text: Goobers and a new set of front
dialog: teeth. It could happen to any guy,
dialog: any time...even ME.
scene_heading: EXT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: A JANITOR raises the American flag. It flaps proudly as the
text: teenager chains his bike to a bike rack.
text: He glances up at the flag, which is reflected in his uber-hip
text: sunglasses. When he smiles, in SLOW MO, his teeth seem to
text: sparkle.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: Uh, that's not me. I'm over here.
text: We SWISH PAN to another teenager, locking his bike. Meet our
text: much less glamorous hero: TED NELSON, 17. A decent looking
dialog: kid. Not hip enough to be cool. Not square enough to be
text: tormented. He joins the other KIDS heading into the school.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You're disappointed, I know. I
dialog: admit, I was hopeless back then.
dialog: The 'do, the shades, ugh. But I
dialog: always had good taste in women.
scene_heading: INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY
text: CHRISTY MALONE, 17, fills her cheerleader uniform in all the
text: right places. We watch her at her locker. Also in SLOW MO.
text: Which makes even her most mundane task seem graceful. Wow,
dialog: just look at her stack those books.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: That's Christy Malone. Head
dialog: cheerleader, love of my life, lust
dialog: of my loins.
text: Christy glances off screen and SQUEALS excitedly. Another
text: cheerleader enters the frame, holding a newspaper called
text: "EXPOSED!" Christy reads the headline.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: "Health Teacher Flunks Her Own
dialog: Lesson!" No WAY! It's Miss Pratt,
dialog: smoking a doobie!
text: Christy calls to Ted....
speaker_heading: CHRISTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at this, Ted! Imagine if we
dialog: did THIS in the school paper!
text: She shows him "Exposed!" Ted gawks. Happy just to be this
text: close to Christy. But they are quickly interrupted by...
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN (O.S.)
dialog: Hand them over! Immediately!
text: PRINCIPAL RICHARD MERKIN, mid-50's, marches down the hallway,
text: seizing copies of "EXPOSED!" from students' hands. We can see
text: that it is a "homemade" looking newspaper. And there's
text: obviously much ado about it. Christy winks at Ted as she
text: hides the newspaper in her locker.
text: FREEZE FRAME ON Christy, WINKING.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: Look at that smile. That wink.
dialog: That's no platonic wink. That's a
dialog: wink that says, "I don't just want
dialog: you, Ted. I NEED you." So of course
dialog: I had to ask her to the prom. I
dialog: mean, she was practically begging
dialog: for it.
scene_heading: INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - NEWSROOM - DAY
text: Ted ambles toward Christy. Struggling for nonchalance. She
text: limbers up by stretching her leg high against the wall. She
text: whispers to another CHEERLEADER. They giggle. Then Christy
text: turns to Ted. Flashing that perfect smile of hers.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Just the guy I've been looking for.
text: Ted wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I've been looking for you, too.
text: Christy continues stretching. Driving Ted crazy with her
text: contortionist moves.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Wouldn't it be awesome if we were
dialog: about to say the exact same thing?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: From your lips, to God's ears.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You go first.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Ladies first. I insist.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Well. The prom's coming up.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: And I was wondering.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: If you don't have...I mean...
text: She looks up at him with gorgeous blue eyes. Then blurts...
speaker_heading: CHRISTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Teddy? Would you please please
dialog: please take me to the prom?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: SHUT UP! Are you serious? Of
dialog: course I will...of course.
text: Christy joyously jumps into Ted's arms. Wrapping her legs
text: around him in a passionate embrace. The entire room
speaker_heading: APPLAUDS.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You are the most wonderful guy in
dialog: the whole wide world, and I love
dialog: you madly, Teddy Nelson!
text: And just as she's about to plant one right on his lips...
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TED'S OFFICE - NEWSROOM - DAY
text: The shrill ringing of a TORNADO DRILL ALARM snaps Ted out of
text: his reverie. A large glass window separates Ted's EDITOR-IN
text: CHIEF office from the rest of the school newsroom. We
text: realize now that Ted has only been gazing through the window
text: at Christy, watching her stretch those gorgeous limbs of
dialog: hers.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: Sorry about that. A cheap trick, I
dialog: know. But it's my story and my
dialog: fantasy. So cut me some slack.
text: He follows the other students to...
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: Ted joins his schoolmates, lining up on both sides of the
text: hallway. Far from any windows. They all know the drill.
text: Christy's just across the hall from Ted. He can't take his
text: eyes off of her.
text: CHARLIE DUKE, 17, approaches Ted. He's got a camera around
text: his neck and so much confidence, it's a wonder he can balance
text: his head on his shoulders.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on, bro. Spare yourself the
dialog: humiliation, the degradation...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You and your pep talks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't get me wrong. We can salivate
dialog: over all the Christy Malones of our
dialog: lives. Wishing we could devour them
dialog: like melt-in-your-mouth filet
dialog: mignon. But we're strictly
dialog: hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty
dialog: eight percent lean, is about the
dialog: best we can hope for.
text: FREEZE FRAME ON CHARLIE.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: That's Charlie. My best friend.
dialog: He's into beef analogies, partly
dialog: because he's a butcher's son, and
dialog: partly because, well, he's just
dialog: into beef analogies. What can I
dialog: say? He's also a photographer...
scene_heading: INT. BASKETBALL COURT - TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: Charlie kneels by the sidelines. Shooting cheerleaders with
text: his Nikon and an obscenely long lens.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: ...a very gifted photographer.
scene_heading: THROUGH CHARLIE'S LENS:
text: A cheerleader's ripe buttocks, peeking out from beneath a
text: short pleated skirt. As she kicks and jumps, her little red
text: panties wedge themselves firmly between her cheeks. The
text: camera skillfully tracks her movements, waiting until...
text: The cheerleader's hand comes down. In SLOW MO, her finger
text: slips under her panties and tugs on the fabric, pulling it
text: over her cheeks. Charlie's motor drive whirls.
text: RAPID STILL SHOTS OF THE CHEERLEADER'S BOTTOM
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: The senior class voted him, "Most
dialog: Likely To Have A Restraining Order
dialog: Filed Against Him." But that's
dialog: another story.
scene_heading: BACK TO CORRIDOR
text: Ted and Charlie lean against the wall.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I genuinely think she wants me. I
text: feel a vibe.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That vibe is from your wrist, pal.
dialog: You've been over-tenderizing your
dialog: meat, again.
text: Christy catches Ted's eye and smiles a perfect smile.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: See? Did you see that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: She smiles at everyone, Ted. She's
text: like a newborn with gas.
text: Charlie secretly shows Ted a nudie magazine. "HEAVEN." A
text: GORGEOUS WOMAN with perfect breasts graces the cover. A
text: golden halo over her head. Charlie flips it open. Points to
text: a picture.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: The only chick more untouchable
dialog: than Christy Malone is Miss April.
dialog: (feminine voice)
dialog: "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu
dialog: burgers, rainy nights, and riding
dialog: bareback. My biggest turn-off is
dialog: cell phones during sex." Here's a
dialog: tip: set it on VIBRATE, honey, and
dialog: don't be stingy with the lube.
dialog: (winking at Ted)
dialog: Don't knock it till you tried it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Were you always this sick?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: One thing for sure, Christy Malone
dialog: ain't lookin THAT good naked.
text: Ted takes a peek at Ginger. Then at Christy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Someday, I'll find out.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You have a better chance of being
text: hit by a Mack truck with a
text: refrigerated cargo bed full of
dialog: sirloin tip.
text: Ted grabs the magazine and flips through more pages.
text: Beautiful, naked women. Palm trees. Blue skies. Bubbling
text: Jacuzzis. Red Ferraris. The stuff that fantasies are made of.
text: Ted looks determined...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I defy your hamburger theory of
text: life, and all of the unfulfilled
dialog: hopes and dreams it represents.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That's crazy talk.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I defy any and all limits.
text: Charlie can see the look in Ted's eyes. He's about to do
text: something bold and daring. Something he'll regret.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (walking away; defiantly)
dialog: Any time, any day, a man can
text: completely reinvent himself.
text: Ted starts to walk across the corridor, ignoring Charlie...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm warning you. This is an
dialog: official warning. Danger, Will
dialog: Robinson, danger.
text: A quietly attractive teenaged girl, JULIE CONROY, watches
text: Ted. She seems concerned, too.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: There's one more person you should
dialog: meet. Someone integral to my story.
scene_heading: FREEZE FRAME ON JULIE.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: That's Julie Conroy. Unlike the
dialog: rest of these losers, she didn't
dialog: grow up in Xenia, Ohio. I just met
dialog: her that day. But already, she had
dialog: made a difference in my life.
scene_heading: INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
text: Teachers mill around. Chatting. Snacking on donuts, coffee.
text: PRINCIPAL MERKIN bursts in, spilling a stack of "EXPOSED!"
text: onto a table. Everyone freezes.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Oh, Miss Pratt, Miss Pratt! What
dialog: were you thinking? How could you
dialog: be so careless?
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Exposing Hypocrisy in the Morons
dialog: who Teach Us." That's the little
dialog: bastard's motto!
text: The teachers turn to MISS PRATT. We recognize her from the
text: cover of "EXPOSED!"
speaker_heading: MISS PRATT
dialog: (summoning courage)
dialog: Principal Merkin, I realize we have
dialog: to teach the children that
dialog: recreational drugs are the devil's
dialog: work, but that doesn't mean we
dialog: don't dance with the Prince of
dialog: Darkness ourselves, every now and
dialog: again.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Ah, well, bravo! That's just what
dialog: we'll tell the school board.
text: Suddenly, an AIR VENT pops open and CRASHES on top of a
text: coffee machine. THE WHOLE ROOM, IN SHOCKED SILENCE, turns to
dialog: look at...
text: JULIE, her head framed by the air duct. She holds a digital
text: camera in her hand. Her expression says: "Oh, shit."
text: Principal Merkin narrows his eyes at the "little bastard" who
dialog: has been making his life hell.
scene_heading: INT. TED'S OFFICE - NEWSROOM - DAY
text: Julie sits in a chair in front of Ted's desk. She and Ted
dialog: size up one another.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: Merk's punishment was cruel.
dialog: Expulsion without appeal. Or
dialog: working for me on the school paper.
dialog: The school paper would be torture
dialog: for a gonzo reporter like Julie and
dialog: we both knew it. But what choice
dialog: did she have?
text: Julie leans back on the chair, rests her feet on Ted's files,
text: and blows a huge bubble.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: So, William Randolph. Your last big
dialog: scoop contrasted the popularity of
dialog: Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate
text: Snickerdoodles at the annual bake
dialog: sale.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's just one example. My
dialog: reporting has made a difference.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Let me guess: retail sales of
dialog: little chocolate sprinkles have
dialog: gone through the roof!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The school dumpsters used to
text: overflow to the point where the
dialog: stench was unbearable. My award
dialog: winning exposé changed all that.
dialog: The city added an extra weekday
text: trash pick-up.
text: Julie deadpans...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate
dialog: it that you got busted. I know the
dialog: school paper sucks in comparison,
dialog: but it's really not THAT BAD.
text: Ted's eyes wander to Christy, who prances around the
text: newsroom. Julie notices.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Don't even tell me you're hot for
dialog: Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Christy's a very talented
dialog: journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her
dialog: future.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I didn't know they gave them for
dialog: Best Lip Gloss Retention During a
dialog: Blow Job.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Me-ow.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get
text: it over with.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I have absolutely no intention--
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: --Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
scene_heading: BACK TO CORRIDOR
text: Ted nears Christy. Students stare as he passes. They elbow
text: one another. Whispering.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: So you see, this is really about a
dialog: triple-dog-dare. I don't even know
dialog: what it means. I just know, unless
dialog: it's a felony, a triple-dog-dare
dialog: pretty much has to be met with
dialog: immediate action.
text: Ted seems unaware that all eyes are upon him. The cacophony
text: of the corridor settles. He gets down on one knee in front
dialog: of Christy.
text: Christy looks down on Ted. Smiles that smile. Which freezes
text: as her eyes dart. Realizing that everyone is staring at them
text: with great anticipation.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh, Christy, I was wondering...
speaker_heading: ALL STUDENTS
text: WOULD YOU GO TO THE PROM WITH
dialog: ME?!!!
text: The corridor explodes with LAUGHTER. Ted flushes with
text: embarrassment. Christy looks mortified.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (through gritted teeth)
dialog: Ted, have you lost your mind?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You like me. I like you. I guess
dialog: it's pretty obvious to everyone.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I don't LIKE you. We're JUST
speaker_heading: FRIENDS.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But that smile.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Oh, Ted, DUH. I smile at everyone
dialog: since I got my braces off.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So you'll think about it?
text: Christy laughs derisively.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You really don't get it, do you? I
dialog: am genetically programmed to desire
text: a big, buff, manly man who can
dialog: defend and provide for me and my
dialog: yet to be conceived offspring!
dialog: It's, like, a caveman thing!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So that's a maybe?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER.
dialog: Except maybe in your dreams.
text: Christy flees. Leaving Ted kneeling there. Alone. Unless you
text: count the hoards of STUDENTS who are watching and LAUGHING
scene_heading: HYSTERICALLY.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: In my dreams. Of course.
dialog: (repeating; chanting)
dialog: This is a dream. This is only a
dialog: dream.
text: Julie approaches. Gives him a hand. Helps him up.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No, Ted. This is an actual
dialog: emergency.
scene_heading: INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - MEN'S ROOM - DAY
text: Ted pukes in the sink.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I tried to warn you, William
text: Randolph. She's got stiletto heels
dialog: hidden in those Keds.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But you triple-dog-dared me.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It was for your own good, in a
dialog: twisted sort of publicly
dialog: humiliating way.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: One word, my friend. One word.
speaker_heading: MEATLOAF.
text: Ted lifts his head. Looks in the mirror. Distraught.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: There's gotta be more to life than
dialog: meatloaf.
scene_heading: INT. THE NELSON KITCHEN - EVENING
text: Not a hair above middle class. Home sweet home nonetheless.
text: Dinner in progress. MOM, DAD, Ted, younger brother, JIMMY. A
text: mutt named CORKY curled under the table. A storm brews.
text: Lightning in the distance. Thunder RUMBLES.
text: Ted's Mom observes her son with unmistakable Mom-radar. She
text: slides a slab of - rotten timing! - MEAT LOAF onto his plate
text: with an unpleasant thud. Ted shudders...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: If I never eat another bite of meat
dialog: loaf again, it'll be too soon.
text: Ted's Mom frowns. Jimmy explains matter-of-factly.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to
dialog: represent all that Ted hates about
dialog: his mediocre life and the world we
dialog: live in. He's what you'd call
text: clinically bummed.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why can't we have pot roast or
dialog: stroganoff or even a little London
dialog: broil? I mean, for god's sake, we
dialog: own a grocery store!
text: Ted's parents look at one another, shake their heads. His Dad
text: gently explains...
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We heard about Christy, son.
text: Jimmy tries to stifle a grin.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What is this? Does everybody know
dialog: everything I'm about to say or do
dialog: every freakin' minute of the day?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: No cursing in this house, young
dialog: man. Use the strong vocabulary God
dialog: gave you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't have a shred of privacy in
dialog: this whole stupid town!
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We understand your disappointment,
dialog: Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy,

dialog: (catches himself)
dialog: We...uh...we understand your
dialog: disappointment.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's my private business! Mine!
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Can the tantrum, sweet pea. We're
dialog: the good guys, remember?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Mom, Dad. Don't allow this
dialog: disturbing behavior to furrow your
dialog: collective brow. Ted's just
dialog: experiencing some post-adolescent
dialog: turmoil, coming to terms with the

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I hate Xenia! I hate my life!
text: Ted charges for the front door...
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.) (CONT'D)

dialog: Three, two, one...
scene_heading: EXT. NELSON HOUSE - EVENING
text: Ted bursts outside and plows straight into MARTY ZUKERMAN, a
text: short, rotund man in his mid-50s.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Whoa! Sorry, mister.
text: Zukerman's briefcase and papers are knocked to the ground.
text: Ted helps to retrieve them.
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: In a hurry, are we?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I was in the middle of a
dialog: melodramatic exit. It wouldn't
dialog: really make a statement if I
dialog: tiptoed out the door...What are you
dialog: selling?
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: Bad news.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: People pay good money for that?
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: I'm just a messenger.
text: Ted starts to back away. Instinctively knowing the bad news
dialog: must be for him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad
dialog: news I can take for one day.
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: It's about your parents.
text: Ted stops. Puzzled.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: My parents? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm
dialog: a blurter. Your parents...They
dialog: ...well...they exist no further.
dialog: (off Ted's confusion)
dialog: Skinny-dipping. The Amazon.
dialog: Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You've got the wrong guy. The
dialog: closest my parents have been to the
dialog: Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at
dialog: Epcot.
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: Well kid, I'm speaking of...your
dialog: biological parents.
scene_heading: INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Ted sits on the couch, bewildered. Dad beside him. Mom pours

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: How quaint.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (quietly; moping)
dialog: It's spring break. I don't want to
dialog: go to a will reading.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: That's part of growing up, honey.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What? Having spring break ruined by
dialog: will readings?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You know what your mother means.
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: All right, I can give you two
dialog: tickets, prepaid, but you must be
dialog: there. There's no other way.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Mom, Dad. Allow me to accompany
dialog: Ted. I can assure you, I'll be the

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I think Ted should take someone

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: What about Charlie? You boys could

speaker_heading: TED

scene_heading: INT. TED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I remember spring break of my

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Grandpa was so strong back then.
text: Working from the crack of dawn. So

speaker_heading: TED

dialog: then found out I knew more than
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You're way ahead of me again?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (proving it...)
dialog: It was the year of the rhizopus
dialog: rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm.
dialog: You sacrificed your dream to go to
dialog: the prize hog festival. And in the
dialog: end you saved the peaches and you
dialog: didn't have to slaughter your sow.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: The lesson being?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sometimes you have to do stuff you
dialog: don't want to do. It's all part of
dialog: growing up. And it usually works
text: out peachy in the end.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I'm getting so good at this.
text: Dad chuckles, but Ted's still moping.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You guys are my parents.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Of course we are.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: They didn't want me when I was
dialog: born. Why should I care...
dialog: ...if they're dead.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Son.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, why should I?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: They had a rough life. Your father
dialog: was a bouncer.
dialog: Your mother was, well, a two-bit
dialog: stripper. There was no place for a
dialog: baby.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: They did do one great thing. They
dialog: gave us our boy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Be a sport. How bad could spring
dialog: break in Los Angeles be?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I guess we could go to Disneyland
dialog: or something.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Think of it as a rite of passage to
dialog: manhood.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Like one of those "National

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Whatever helps you cope.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I guess it's better than having
text: tribal patterns carved in my face.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: There ya go. Always remember, focus
dialog: on the peach...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: ...not the pit.
text: Ted's Dad hugs him briefly, laughing...
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Always one step ahead of your dear
dialog: old dad.
scene_heading: EXT. LAX - DAY
text: A 747 lands screaming on the runway.
scene_heading: INT. LAX - DAY
text: Ted and Charlie exit the plane. They walk tentatively through
text: the sleeve towards the entry gate.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I wonder if this is what it feels
dialog: like to be born?
text: Ted gives him a look.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Think about it...Long tunnel,
text: bright lights, it's full of vaginal
dialog: symbolism.
speaker_heading: TED
text: Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Seriously, it's like we're being
dialog: reborn. We really could reinvent
dialog: ourselves here, just like you said.
dialog: Nobody knows about your massive
dialog: humiliation.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Nobody knows about your mental
dialog: retardation.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nobody knows you barfed during
dialog: junior high school graduation.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Nobody knows about your constant
dialog: masturbation.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And nobody knows you're a virgin!
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Aw, who are we kidding...
text: Charlie's words echo loudly through the sleeve...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
text: ...EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE A VIRGIN!
text: People stare at Ted as they pass.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I think I'll reinvent a new best
dialog: friend.
scene_heading: INT. LAX - TERMINAL - DAY
text: Ted and Charlie enter the terminal. Friends and family wait
text: for loved ones. A few chauffeurs hold signs with names. One
text: stands out. Tall. Blonde. Gorgeous. In a short skirt. A
text: matching low cut jacket. And a cap. She's stunning. And
text: she's holding a sign that reads: TED NELSON.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What are the odds of there being
dialog: ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Astronomical.
text: They grin at one another. Then approach the Chauffeur.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi, I'm Ted Nelson.
text: With a sad look, the Chauffeur hugs him, kissing one cheek,
dialog: then the other.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: I'm so terribly sorry for your
dialog: loss. Your father was a great man.
text: Ted's stunned. Charlie leans in and whispers.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who the hell was your father?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, Dad said...
scene_heading: INT. STRETCH LIMO - DAY
text: Ted and Charlie sit on opposites ends of the plush interior.
text: Charlie eyes the control console with its slew of gadgets.
text: They practically have to shout to hear one another.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: ...A bouncer? Are you serious?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Maybe he got promoted.
text: Charlie continues playing with the console switches.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't. Touch. Anything.
text: Too late. Rock music pulsates through the limo.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: This is the life, baby. We get
dialog: ourselves some tail and we're
dialog: talking SPRING BREAK!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Cut it out, before you break
dialog: something!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: For a guy about to try his first
dialog: Dom Perignon, you are extremely
dialog: uptight.
text: He flips another switch. The bar opens. Revealing a bottle
text: of Dom Perignon on ice. Charlie grins broadly.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We can't afford that!
text: Charlie grabs the bottle and starts to open it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't you know anything about limo
dialog: etiquette? Everything in here is
dialog: included for our pleasure.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Wait a second, I thought we were
dialog: hamburger guys.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And like every hamburger guy knows,
dialog: when you get your one big chance at
dialog: the good life, you abuse every
dialog: second of it until they figure out
dialog: you don't belong there and kick
dialog: your sorry ass out.
text: POP! The cork flies through the air. Bounces off the
text: ceiling. And hits another switch. The sun roof glides open.
text: Champagne overflows from the bottle. All over Charlie's
text: crotch.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Nice. Is that in the limo etiquette
dialog: handbook, too?
text: Charlie grabs a bar towel as Ted looks toward the sun roof.
text: Beautifully blue Southern California sky greets him. With an
text: occasional palm tree swooshing by. Ted rises.
scene_heading: EXT. LIMO - DAY - MOVING
text: Ted's head peeks out of the sun roof. Tentatively. Unsure. He
text: takes in the sights as the limo cruises Sunset Boulevard.
text: People stare at him. A beautiful BLONDE smiles and waves. He
text: waves back, very timidly.
text: Charlie sticks his head out, too. Sun on their faces. Wind in
dialog: their hair.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This is how the other half lives,
dialog: bro. Enjoy it while you can.
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRY GATE - DAY
text: The limo passes through the ornate gate of what could only be
text: a sprawling mansion. It comes to a sudden halt. The door
text: swings open to reveal a group of BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMEN. Clad
text: in very short black dresses and even some black bikinis. Sad
text: expressions on their faces.
scene_heading: EXT. LIMO - DAY
text: The MOURNERS embrace Ted.
scene_heading: BEAUTIFUL MOURNER #1
dialog: Welcome, Mr. Nelson. You are so
dialog: very very welcome here.
scene_heading: BEAUTIFUL MOURNER #2
dialog: We feel your pain, so deeply.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: Something tells me we're not in
dialog: Xenia anymore, Toto.
scene_heading: EXT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - DAY
text: The beautiful young women guide Ted towards the mansion.
text: Charlie follows. A particularly VOLUPTUOUS BEAUTY eyes him
dialog: curiously.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm Charles. The handsome, devoted
dialog: best friend. We're so close, we
dialog: feel each other's pain.
text: The voluptuous beauty notices Charlie's soaked crotch. He
text: winks...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: See what you do to me, baby.
text: Just then, the spry HELEN McDOLE, 60s, emerges from the
text: mansion. She approaches Ted and hugs him.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Oh my, he would have been so proud.
dialog: You're the spitting image of him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He never spits, ma'am. Ever. He
dialog: can't even get a good hocker going.
dialog: I've tried to teach him. It comes
text: from the diaphragm.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (sharply; to Charlie)
dialog: You're on the next plane home.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (emotional embrace)
dialog: I'm Helen McDole. Your father's
dialog: executive secretary.
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Ted takes a seat at the spacious conference table. Helen
text: sits on his right. Charlie sits on his left.
text: Zukerman and two other IMPATIENT ATTORNEYS wait at the head
text: of the table. Finally Zukerman checks his watch and rises.
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: We're running out of time. The
dialog: kid's here. We don't need HIM.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Perhaps we could be patient for
dialog: just a moment or two longer?
text: They all watch a WALL CLOCK. Seconds pass, slowly, slowly.
text: Then suddenly Zukerman rises.
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: What did the doctor say to the
dialog: nurse as they watched something
text: black and white and red in a
dialog: blender?
dialog: (a wry smile)
dialog: No more patients.
text: Very dramatically, Zukerman slides a copy of "Heaven"
text: magazine down the conference table. Right to Ted.
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm seventeen. I know it like the
text: back of my hand.
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: Your fathered owned the entire
dialog: "Heaven" empire. You own it now.
dialog: Any questions?
text: Ted's stunned, speechless. Charlie gawks.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Everything? The publishing
dialog: division, the real estate holdings,
dialog: the retail outlets, the theme
dialog: parks?
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
text: As far as the eye can see.
text: Zukerman presses a remote control. A wall panel slides open
text: to reveal a large monitor which springs to life. On the
text: screen is a striking couple. Ted'S BIOLOGICAL PARENTS.
text: HEATHER and TOM DEEDS. Heather, stunningly sexy and
text: overflowing from her gold sequined halter top. Tom, very
text: handsome in a Vegas showman sort of way.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be
dialog: right there to hug the living
dialog: daylights out of you!
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: But if you're watching this, then
dialog: it means we bit the dust.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: But don't worry...we'll be in
dialog: heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean.
dialog: Not that heaven is an actual place,
dialog: but more like a state of being. Or
dialog: not being. Who knows. Maybe we know
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: If you're anything like yours
dialog: truly, then you probably figure we
dialog: didn't want you when you were born,
dialog: so who cares if we're dead? Am I
dialog: right?
text: Ted looks guilty. This is too weird.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: But we did want you. It's just that
dialog: you don't always get to keep what
dialog: you want. We knew you needed a real
dialog: mom and dad.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We had no idea the nudie magazine
dialog: we started in the garage would turn
dialog: into all this.
text: Heather holds up the first issue of "Heaven." She's on the
text: cover, wearing nothing but a halo. She looks almost exactly
text: the same today, with a few extra nips and tucks.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Can you believe that was me?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Before we knew it, we created the
dialog: most popular men's magazine in the
dialog: entire nation. The rest is history.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: So here we are. Dead. But we never
dialog: want you to want for anything. That
dialog: is, we want you to have everything.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Everything.
text: Heather leans forward and blows a kiss into the camera. Her
text: strongest assets spilling forward.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: We love you, Ted. We always did. We
dialog: always will.
text: Charlie's practically slobbering. He elbows Ted.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I can't believe that's your mother.
dialog: We're talking babe-a-licious chub
dialog: fest, right here in the 501's.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Perv.
text: At that moment, the doors burst open. WILLIAM G. DEEDS (UNCLE
text: BILLY) sails into the room. Handsome in an unconventional
text: way, he exudes passion and eccentricity.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: I'm so terribly sorry. Am I too
dialog: late?
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: Ah, Mr. Deeds. You're just in time
dialog: to congratulate your nephew. He
dialog: inherited the empire.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: (a broad smile)
dialog: Every morsel of it?
speaker_heading: ZUKERMAN
dialog: It would appear so.
text: Uncle Billy hugs Ted with great enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Smashing! Welcome to the family,
dialog: Ted. You are going to breathe some
dialog: new life into this place. You are
dialog: going to set the world on fire! You
dialog: are going to...call me Uncle Billy?
dialog: Please?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: I have only one concern...
text: Ted waits. Swept up by Uncle Billy's spirit.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: You do like girls, don't you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Of course I like girls.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: As much as possible.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You're sure?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to the rescue)
dialog: He likes them with the unbridled
text: enthusiasm of a seventeen-year-old
dialog: virgin who's been making mental
text: beef jerky since he saw the bevy of
text: tender young skirt steaks at his
dialog: new hacienda.
text: Uncle Billy grins broadly.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: That's my boy!
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Uncle Billy leads Ted and Charlie through the cavernous room.
text: Sexy, semi-clad oil paintings of Ted's biological mother
text: adorn the walls.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: The parties are held in here when
text: the weather dips below seventy.
dialog: Which is seldom.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Seldom? No kidding?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You said parties but you meant
dialog: ORGIES, right?
dialog: (to Ted; quietly)
dialog: Stick with me. I know their codes.
text: Uncle Billy winks at Ted.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: The orgies, exactly. Take a deep
dialog: breath. You can smell it. Pure
text: sexuality, oozing from the walls.
text: Charlie takes a deep breath. Uncle Billy and Ted share a
text: conspiratorial smirk.
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GAME ROOM - DAY
text: The epitome of every boy's dream arcade. Everything from
dialog: classic pinball machines to the most high tech virtual
text: reality game that has yet to hit the market. Charlie shakes
text: his head in amazement.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Naked girls, wild sex, video games.
dialog: No wonder it's called "Heaven."
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: This is a fun place...but we don't
dialog: usually come here until after the
dialog: orgies.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (playing along)
dialog: Ah, in other words, this is the
dialog: apres-orgy salon?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Indeed it is. During the day,
dialog: visitors prefer to be outside, au
dialog: naturel. As it were.
text: Charlie continues to gawk. Ted's equally impressed but
text: holding it together.
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - SWIMMING ROOM - DAY
text: Uncle Billy leads Ted and Charlie by the indoor pool which is
text: decorated like a tropical pond, complete with exotic
text: vegetation, lava rocks, and a waterfall. They pass through a
text: cave-like entrance and find themselves...
scene_heading: EXT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - SWIMMING POOL - DAY
text: ...coming out by another spectacular waterfall. Which
text: separates the indoor and outdoor pools. Numerous BEAUTIFUL
text: WOMEN swim, chat, play water polo. Some topless, some might
text: as well be. The boys watch in awe as one woman rubs lotion
text: on another woman's back.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Hello, girls! Have you met Ted?
text: The women wave, ad-libbing warm greetings. Charlie leans
text: towards Ted, confiding...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This is like my every wet dream
dialog: come true. I don't even care that
dialog: you're here, too, bro.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Good advice, Ted. You have your
dialog: father's instincts.
text: "His father." The words sound so strange. He never even met
dialog: the guy.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Just remember, you're not the man
dialog: you were a day ago. And these
dialog: girls, let's just say they'd be
dialog: eager to please you.
text: Ted gulps. It's hard to believe this is real.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I wonder how many of them will be
dialog: at the orgy tonight?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: This isn't some 80's porno film,
dialog: you dip shit. There are no wild sex
dialog: orgies.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Not ever. Never.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Never say never.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, god. Look. Look.
text: Ted looks. A beautiful woman sensuously rubs tanning lotion
text: over her OWN breasts. The boys stare, riveted.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I really love your peaches, wanna
dialog: shake your tree.
text: Uncle Billy grins.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Maybe she needs help, Ted. You
dialog: should be a gentleman.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (voice cracking)
dialog: I...uh...I think she's doing fine
text: on her own.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (having a moment)
dialog: Oh baby, yes, yes, yes. Fuck me
dialog: like you mean it.
text: Ted elbows Charlie out of his fantasy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You kiss your mother with that
dialog: mouth?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'd kiss your mother with this
dialog: mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you
dialog: know...
dialog: He means dead.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So far away? In Xenia?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, whatever.
scene_heading: INT. THE NELSON HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Mom waits nervously for the phone to ring.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Teddy? Is that you?
text: Dad hurries out of the bathroom, hiking up his pajamas. Mom
text: speaks loudly, as if Ted's in Siberia.
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: How are you, baby? Are you all
dialog: right?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. TED'S BEDROOM - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT
text: A palatial suite. Very Louis XIV. Ted throws a sheet over a
text: nude sculpture of his biological mother. While holding a
text: cordless phone in the crook of his neck.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in
dialog: Siberia, you know.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Did you have a nice flight? Are
dialog: they taking good care of you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah, I'm doing fine. I have so
dialog: much to tell you. I don't even
dialog: know where to begin.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Save it, honey. We want to hear
dialog: every detail when you get back, but
dialog: we don't want you to run up Mr.
dialog: Zukerman's phone bill.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's okay, Mom. Trust me.
text: Mom hands Dad the phone.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Ted, it's your dad. I have a
dialog: question for you. I don't know how
dialog: to put it tactfully. You know I'm
dialog: lousy with words.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Just say it, Dad.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I know they were simple people, but
dialog: did this trip help your college
dialog: fund at all?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Dad, let's just say I can buy
dialog: anything I want in the whole
dialog: bookstore. Including the bookstore.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (not getting it)
dialog: Well, good. Every little bit helps.
text: Suddenly, Charlie bursts into the room with a pair of
text: binoculars.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Check this out. Hurry!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I better go, Dad.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We'll see you soon. Have fun in...
dialog: (trying to be hip)
dialog: ...the land of fruits and nuts.
scene_heading: INT. TED'S BEDROOM - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT
text: Charlie flips off the light switch and whispers...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hurry.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: What is it now?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Check it out!
text: Charlie shoves the binoculars at Ted and guides him toward
text: the window which overlooks the outdoor pool.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Don't tell me. Another vision of
dialog: incomparable beauty?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
scene_heading: TED'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS
text: A devastatingly PERFECT WOMAN, GINGER, "Miss April," emerges
text: from the pool, wearing nothing but a g-string. Her skin
text: shimmers from the reflection of the pool lights. Rivulets of
text: water stream down her body. She reaches for a towel and pats
text: her body dry. An incredible aura seems to surround her.
text: Separating her from the other spectacular beauties we've seen
dialog: already.
text: Ted lowers the binoculars. Entranced.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I get it now. You and me. We're
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Dead?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Our plane crashed. In the Grand
text: Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We
dialog: never made it to L.A. They needed
dialog: dental records to identify us. And
dialog: this place. This. Actually. Is.
dialog: Heaven.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Then there must be a whole room,
dialog: made completely of chocolate.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And some really fast cars.
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Ted and Charlie move like thieves in the night.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don't be such a pansy. All of this
dialog: is YOURS.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's a lot to digest. Imagine how
dialog: you'd feel.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'd feel like staying up all night!
dialog: Forever! Or at least till I got the
dialog: LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Ted and Charlie enter. Flip the light switch. It was his
text: parents' very opulent bedroom. Complete with more risqué
text: paintings of Ted's biological mother.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I feel like I'm entering a
dialog: forbidden tomb...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: ...where they get all the really
dialog: good porno channels on cable.
text: Charlie pulls open a dresser drawer filled with Ted's
dialog: mother's lingerie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Cha-ching. Jackpot.
text: Charlie caresses a pair of red silk panties and inhales their
text: powdery fragrance.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Oh, how inappropriate is that!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Take a whiff of heaven.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: How would you like it if I did that
dialog: to your mother's panties?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck.
dialog: But this is different. She wasn't
dialog: your mother mother--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Give me those!
text: Ted grabs the panties just as Charlie pulls away, ripping
text: them in half. Just then the door opens to reveal a very
text: proper ENGLISH BUTLER.
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: I do apologize, sir. I heard a
dialog: noise.
text: Ted and Charlie awkwardly hide the panty halves behind their
dialog: backs.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We were just--
speaker_heading: BUTLER
dialog: --I completely understand, sir.
dialog: I'll leave you to your business.
dialog: Good night.
text: The Butler leaves. Ted glares at Charlie. Who shrugs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: A couple of boys fighting over a
text: pair of red silk panties is nothing
text: compared to what he's seen.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Yeah, he's probably been serving
dialog: cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the
dialog: orgies.
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GARAGE - THE NEXT MORNING
text: The garage is crowded with two dozen sporty classics. Ted
text: runs his hands over the hood of a red Ferrari 575M Maranello.
text: He pulls the door open and slides into the leather seat.
speaker_heading: GINGER (O.S.)
dialog: Wanna take me for a ride?
text: Ted turns around and spots Ginger, the goddess from the pool,
text: making her way towards him. He gulps.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I-I don't have the keys.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: They're in the ignition, silly.
text: Ted glances down. There they are. She hops in next to him.
text: He doesn't know what to do.
speaker_heading: GINGER (CONT'D)
dialog: You do know how to drive?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't have much experience with
dialog: a...uh...stick.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Want a lesson?
text: Ted blushes. He needs a lot of lessons.
speaker_heading: GINGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Press your left foot on the clutch.
dialog: And turn the key.
text: The Ferrari growls to life. Ginger places her hand over
dialog: Ted's.
speaker_heading: GINGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Now release the brake. And slide
text: the stick into first gear.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Got it.
text: Ginger moves her slender fingers on his knees. Showing him
dialog: how it's done.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Now very carefully apply some
dialog: pressure to the gas pedal with your
dialog: right foot as you release the
dialog: clutch with your left.
text: She squeezes his thigh and winks.
scene_heading: EXT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GARAGE - DAY
text: The Ferrari jerks out of the garage and promptly stalls.
text: Ginger giggles. Could Ted be MORE embarrassed?
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: The first time can be awkward. You
dialog: just have to get on and try again.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't even know if I should be
dialog: doing this. It's a very expensive
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: It's your car. These are all your
dialog: cars.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Some of them have to be automatics.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Your father liked shifting. He said
dialog: it brought him closer to the
text: engine. "Like a woman, purring with
dialog: ecstasy."
text: Ted feels his temperature rising. He changes the subject.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm Ted, by the way. I think I
dialog: forgot to say that.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: I know. I'm Ginger. Miss April.
speaker_heading: TED
text: The one with the horses.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: That's me.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I almost didn't recognize you
dialog: without...you know...that stallion
dialog: between...your...uh...legs.
text: Ginger blushes.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: That sounded so much better in my
dialog: head.
text: Ginger GIGGLES. Ted tries to hide behind his less than cool
text: shades. Ginger notices.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Shopping, really? I should tell my
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Don't worry. He found the
dialog: chocolate room.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (big grin)
dialog: Hi ho, Silver.
text: He puts the car in gear. The tires scream as they take off.
text: Gears grind as he shifts. Not exactly purring with ecstasy.
dialog: Yet.
scene_heading: EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY
text: The Ferrari negotiates its way along Rodeo Drive. Ted seems

dialog: has the hang of it.
scene_heading: INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY
text: Ted emerges from a dressing room. Slowly starting to lose
text: his boy-from-Xenia taint. He glances at the price tag,
text: dangling from his sleeve. His eyes widen. Ginger strokes his
text: arm. Whispers seductively in his ear.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Your father always said, "Money
dialog: matters only to the man who doesn't
dialog: have it."
text: Ted listens. Trying to learn.
scene_heading: INT. A CHIC EYEWEAR BOUTIQUE - DAY
text: Ted tries on some snazzy sunglasses. Ginger approves. Ted
text: still checks the price tag.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sorry, habit.
text: Ginger looks into his eyes. As if she can see his soul.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Who exactly ARE you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: And who IS Ted Nelson?
text: Ted's not sure how to respond. He smiles awkwardly.
speaker_heading: GINGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Is he a small town boy, destined to
dialog: live an ordinary life with an
text: ordinary wife and a tiny house with
dialog: a boring old white picket fence?
text: The hamburger life. Now he can defy it.
speaker_heading: GINGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Or do you have a taste for the good
dialog: life, Ted? It's in your blood.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I always knew there was more. I
dialog: felt it.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Then remember, you are the heir to
dialog: a billion dollar empire. You have a
dialog: staff of literally thousands.
dialog: Multiply everything you ever
dialog: imagined by a million and you still
dialog: can't even wrap your head around
dialog: everything that is yours. ALL
dialog: YOURS.
text: Ted slides on the shades. Slowly, purposefully. He grins at
text: the SALES CLERK...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'll take the whole case.
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" HEADQUARTERS - DAY
text: Ted, Charlie, Helen, and Uncle Billy walk past GRAPHIC
text: DESIGNERS in cubicles as Helen leads a tour of the "Heaven"

dialog: check them out.
scene_heading: "HEAVEN" WAR ROOM
text: POLAROIDS OF NAKED WOMEN cover every square inch of wall
text: space. Ted and Charlie gawk. Who can blame them?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Every one of these women thinks she
dialog: should be the next Angel of the
dialog: Month. It's your job, Ted, to
dialog: decide which of them is right.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Let me get this straight...
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: If it isn't straight by now, son,
dialog: you probably should see a doctor.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: These are real, live women?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: (winking at Ted)
dialog: We don't generally feature blow-up
dialog: dolls in our magazine. But hey, if
dialog: you think there's a market for it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: God, I love being dead.
text: Ted focuses on one particular picture. He removes the push
text: pin that holds it to the wall.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I like her.
text: We can see the concerned look on Helen's face. Does this kid
dialog: have any taste at all?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Nice choice. There's only one
dialog: problem.
text: She shows Uncle Billy.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You think she upgraded?
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: They went in through the belly
dialog: button.
text: Uncle Billy nods. He explains gently...
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Tipping?
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: TIPN. Tattoos, implants, piercings,
dialog: nose jobs. Our angels must be pure,
text: unadultered, completely natural.
text: Ted looks at the walls again. Carefully. He has a knack for
text: this. He hands a picture to Helen. She turns to Uncle Billy
text: and smiles.
speaker_heading: HELEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (emotional)
dialog: You have your father's eye.
dialog: His father. He just can't get used to that. Who was this guy?
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM CLOSET - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT
text: Ted looks at the impressive collection of suits. Runs his
text: hands along the fabrics. Picks a particularly stylish jacket
text: and tries it on. It fits poorly. Too big in the chest and
text: shoulders. Ted looks at himself in the full-length mirror.
dialog: He's not half the man his father was.
text: Suddenly there's a KNOCK on the door. Ted quickly takes off
text: his father's jacket and puts on his own. He lets Uncle Billy
text: in. LOUD PARTY SOUNDS momentarily pour into the room.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: There you are, Ted-baby. Everything
dialog: all right?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah. Everything's cool.
text: Ted's struggling with a silk tie. Uncle Billy helps him.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You ready for your big coming out
dialog: party? Everybody's dying to meet
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: TED
text: Just a couple of finishing touches.
dialog: My parents always said you never
dialog: get a second chance to make a good
dialog: first impression.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: They said that? Really?
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh, your parents. The Nelson's.
dialog: Right, right. How midwest. I like
dialog: that.
text: Ted wipes his palms on his slacks. Confiding...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should
dialog: you be nervous?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: All those people out there. It's a
dialog: lot of pressure.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Huh! You laugh in the face of
dialog: pressure!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I do?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You are a multi-media magnate. The
dialog: Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of
dialog: Bottoms.
text: Ted chuckles. Uncle Billy's calming him...
scene_heading: UNCLE BILLY CONT'D)
dialog: You are the Emperor of every little
dialog: girl who dreamed of growing up to
text: see her naughty bits spread eagle,
text: airbrushed to glossy perfection,
text: with staples through her ass.
text: Uncle Billy rubs his shoulders. As if pep-talking him for a
dialog: big fight.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You're the Sultan of Semen. The
dialog: Monarch of Masturbation. The
dialog: Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted.
dialog: Are the King of Coitus.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Me? The King of Coitus?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Whoa. But...that's the thing...
dialog: (he whispers)
dialog: I've never even actually...
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Why, look who's here.
text: Uncle Billy swings the door open to reveal. KIKI and KELLY.
text: Tall, beautiful, leggy IDENTICAL TWINS. They smile warmly at
text: Ted, each offering an arm. Ted holds his head high. Like the
dialog: Sovereign of Sexuality.
scene_heading: LONG DRAMATIC STAIRCASE
text: With the twins on either side of him, Ted struts down the
text: stairs and into a sea of people. All so eager to meet him.
text: Ted acts as if he's been doing this all his life.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (sotto)
text: The Potentate of Poon has arrived.
text: And instantly, he's surrounded. People shake his hands.
text: Women kiss his cheeks. Athletes, movie stars, models.
text: Charlie watches, beaming proudly.
scene_heading: DANCE FLOOR - LATER
text: Charlie thinks he's Travolta. Dressed for disco. Twirling a
text: Super Model. Ted dances among a dozen BEAUTIES. They steal
text: kisses and hugs, here and there. A thousand Cinderellas, all
text: after one Prince Charming. Ted's having the time of his
text: life. Charlie dances up to him. Shouting in his ear...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ain't life amazing? A week ago, you
dialog: couldn't get to second base! Now
dialog: you OWN second base!
text: They high-five one another. An EXOTIC BEAUTY grabs Ted and
text: starts dirty dancing. Rubbing herself against him. Ted's
text: clueless. So he improvises. People cheer him on. He thrusts
text: his pelvis. Feigns various sex acts. Hilarious, goofy, but it
dialog: works.
scene_heading: EXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT
text: The party's over. Ted relaxes in the Jacuzzi, sipping
text: champagne. Thrilled, elated, blasted. Uncle Billy sits
text: across from him. Two MASSEUSES tenderize their shoulders.
text: But as the scene continues the women take an even greater
text: interest in each other. Stealing a kiss here. A touch there.
text: Ted attention is distracted as he chats with Uncle Billy.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: I told you you could do it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I was like a different person
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You were the new and improved you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I would have been laughed right out
dialog: of Xenia.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: No one will be laughing at you now,
dialog: Ted. You can take that to the bank.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's really going to be strange
text: going home in a couple of days.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You ARE home. But go ahead, finish
dialog: school, do what you feel you need
dialog: to do. In the meantime, I'll be
dialog: your point person here on the
dialog: magazine.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Really? You'd do that for me?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: I've been very lazy for a long,
dialog: long time.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You seem like you're anything but
dialog: lazy, Uncle Billy.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: (confiding)
dialog: I never finished school myself.
dialog: Never had to. My brother built this
dialog: empire from nothing but his wife's
dialog: perky tits and a whole lot of
dialog: gumption. He gave me a cushy job on
dialog: a silver platter. I never struggled
dialog: for a second.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: My parents always say hard work
dialog: builds character.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: It's not like I didn't have ideas,
dialog: I had plenty of ideas. But I never
dialog: even shared them with your father.
dialog: Never had the guts.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What kind of ideas?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Well...for one thing...I think it's
dialog: despicable that we exclude so many
dialog: women that only fit our western
dialog: notion of "classic beauty."
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You think we should be more open
dialog: minded?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: The world is a big, beautiful
dialog: place. We can open new markets in
dialog: Africa and Asia. Imagine the Dali
dialog: Lhama reading our magazine.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: In other words, our scope is too
dialog: narrow.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: At our press conference tomorrow, I
dialog: think we should announce our plans
dialog: to explore the world. Not just a
text: few leggy 36D's, with blond hair
text: upstairs and down.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's perfect.
text: The Masseuses help Uncle Billy out of the Jacuzzi. They say
text: their goodnights and Ted closes his eyes. When he opens them,
text: Ginger stands at the edge of the tub.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Want some company?
text: Ted can barely nod. She unzips the back of her dress and lets
text: it fall to her feet. The silhouette of her nude body is
text: startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. Ted watches as she
text: descends, step by step, into the frothy water.
text: Ted's paralyzed with desire and fear. Ginger descends deeper.
text: A wash of foam caresses her breasts. She continues. Until
text: she's completely submerged.
text: Ted looks startled. The "Jaws" theme echoes through his
text: ears. He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels
text: something. Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him.
text: He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's
text: sucked under. He thrashes. His hand grabs the edge of the
text: Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out. And he slides under. Only
text: to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips.
text: Kissing him passionately.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - TED'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Ted and Ginger in bed. Morning rays, satin sheets, what a
text: night. Ted awakens. He stares at Ginger in awe, remembering

text: Ted slides out of bed. Catches his reflection in the mirror.
text: Takes a good look at himself.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (posing; cool)
dialog: Who's your daddy?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

dialog: enough fresh blood to this company

dialog: for the next fifty or sixty years.
dialog: I'll give him the mike now and
dialog: you'll see what I mean. This apple
text: didn't fall far from the tree.
text: Ted prepares to speak. A little nervous from the spotlights,
text: but hell, he's a man now. Uncle Billy gives him a reassuring
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Don't forget to tell them all your
dialog: qualifications.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already
dialog: know that part.
dialog: (proud of himself)
dialog: For two years I've been the editor
dialog: of the high school paper in Xenia,
dialog: Ohio. I've won some awards, made a
dialog: difference.
dialog: I've always had journalism in my
dialog: soul. Now I know why.
text: He glances at Uncle Billy, who urges him to tell more.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: They tell me I've got my father's
dialog: taste in women and cars.
dialog: (winking)
dialog: The faster, the better.
text: CHUCKLES from the crowd. Uncle Billy gives him a "thumb's up"

speaker_heading: DELIVERYMAN

speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: DELIVERY MAN #2
dialog: Delivery for Robert Nelson.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: For me? What is it?
speaker_heading: DELIVERY MAN #2
dialog: Appears to be tools, sir.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh, no. Ted's gone completely

text: Dad approaches the crate as the Delivery Man opens it to

text: Tears in his eyes.
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Sweetheart, what is it?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I always wanted Craftsman tools. He
dialog: even got me the limited edition

speaker_heading: MOM

scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: What is all this? When are you

speaker_heading: TED

text: pattern of white billowy clouds.
text: The door slides open and out hops Ted. In SLOW-MO. Looking
text: seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his
text: stylish Persol shades. Until he takes a second step and
text: stumbles slightly, catching himself from falling face first
text: into the grass.
text: Charlie is right behind him. Looking great, too, but vaguely
text: Mafioso in his efforts to be hip. He turns to the beautiful

text: Ted and Charlie strut towards the school as Principal Merkin
text: bursts through the front doors, shouting...
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: You cannot land a helicopter in my
dialog: school yard! Get that blasted thing
dialog: out of here!
text: Ted raises his hand. The chopper rises as if on cue.
text: Without a word, Ted and Charlie pass the ruffled Principal
text: Merkin and strut toward the entrance. Classmates surround

text: best friend. Julie walks up to Charlie.
speaker_heading: JULIE

scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN

dialog: What is it, William Randolph? Your

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: TED
text: Finally, some gratitude.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We're grateful, Ted. It's not that.
dialog: Those Craftsman tools...they're a
dialog: dream come true.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Your Dad and I were raised with a
dialog: certain work ethic, that's all.
text: Julie listens closely, admiring Ted's parents.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We can't start living like we're
dialog: the Rockerfellers or something.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Mom, Dad. The Rockerfellers are
dialog: paupers compared to my favorite
dialog: brother, Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You don't have to work another day
dialog: in your lives.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: But how would we pay our bills?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We just barely have enough for your
dialog: college tuition, son.
text: Ted's frustration mounts.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Don't you get it? In one day I earn
dialog: more interest than the store's
dialog: entire annual revenue.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh. Goodness.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You're free. You can do anything
dialog: you ever wanted to do!
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Like take that trip to Buckingham
dialog: Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the
dialog: Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: But those are our dreams, son. We
dialog: have to make them come true.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Consider me your fairy godfather,
dialog: except without the fairy part. No
dialog: more mealy apples and bruised
dialog: bananas, ever, for the rest of your
dialog: lives.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: But who would run the store?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Forget the store. Think big.
text: Dad looks at Mom. Forget the store. That stings.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Ted, we put a lot of love in our
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: We wanted you and Jimmy to have it
dialog: someday. Something real and honest.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We love our lives just the way they
dialog: are.
text: Disappointed, disgusted, Ted looks to Julie for support.
text: Tears fill her eyes. Mom and Dad moved her. Ted shrugs and
text: digs into his food.
scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY

scene_heading: INT. THE "HEAVEN" JET - DAY

text: a sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Call me Charlie. I'm a photographer
dialog: for "Heaven" magazine. And a very
text: cunning linguist.
text: The Flight Attendant pulls him toward the washroom, quickly.
text: Julie interviews Ted, complete with tape recorder.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I have to admit, I always felt...
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Different how? Different like a
dialog: dwarf at a basketball game? Or
dialog: different like a lesbian in pumps?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't get the distinction.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Could everybody else tell you were
dialog: different, or were you the only one
dialog: who knew?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I felt limited. I felt confined. I
dialog: felt like I was suffocating.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I see. So more like a tight rope
text: walker who secretly wants to be a
dialog: trapeze artist.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Interesting.
text: Another FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches...
scene_heading: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
dialog: Warm peanuts?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No thanks. I prefer my penis at

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: She said peanuts, you cretin.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You never know around here.
text: Julie raises her eyebrows. Taking notes.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't write that part.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Is this an gritty exposé or a candy
dialog: ass press release?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Write what you want. Just try not
dialog: to make it so obvious that you're
dialog: crazy about me.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Funny you should say "peachy."
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I did my homework. Your grandfather
dialog: was a peach farmer.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: My adoptive grandfather. Who knows
dialog: what my biological grandfather did.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Undoubtedly an aristocratic
dialog: bartender of some sort.
text: Ted loves her spunk. And the chemistry between them.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Considering this is your first time
dialog: on a private jet, on which you are
dialog: interviewing the world's most
dialog: eligible bachelor, you are
text: extremely cavalier.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I bet there are lots and lots of
text: mirrors on Planet Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: See? You're impertinent, rude,
dialog: sarcastic.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: And this is not my first time on a
dialog: private jet, so quit acting like
dialog: I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: A little respect would be nice,
dialog: that's all.
text: Julie snickers.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Money can't buy respect, Ted.
dialog: Saying what you mean. Meaning what
dialog: you say. Being an honorable person.
dialog: That's how you earn respect.
scene_heading: INT. GREEN ROOM - DAY
text: Ted waits for his appearance on "The Tonight Show." Ginger
text: smooths out the imaginary creases in Ted's Armani jacket.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Great jacket, Teddy. It makes your

text: Julie rolls her eyes. Here we go again. Uncle Billy and
text: Helen look on approvingly.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You do look smashing.
speaker_heading: HELEN
text: Positively dashing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Sharp as a mashed potato sandwich.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh wow, look...they've even got
dialog: baby gherkins!
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: I have an idea! I'll be right back!
text: And she dashes out the door. Ted leans towards Julie, who
text: quietly observes everything.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well? What do you think of her?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You're so twitterpated you don't
text: even see the miner's hat and the
dialog: pickax.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You're implying she's, what, a gold
dialog: digger?
text: Julie shrugs. Isn't it obvious?
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Charlie's right. Jealousy is so
dialog: unattractive.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Second only to unbridled,
text: narcissistic conceit.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (whining)
dialog: Why can't you be nice to me?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You've got enough people kissing
dialog: your ass.
text: Ginger returns with a rose.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Here you go, cutie patootie. Rich

dialog: Julie gives Ted a look. See what I mean.
scene_heading: INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW SET - DAY
text: Jay Leno seems charmed. Ted behaves as if he does this every

speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: How are the hometown folks treating
dialog: you, back in Xenia?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Well, Jay. They've been
dialog: exceptionally supportive.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Are they hitting you up for
dialog: donations? Asking you to sponsor
dialog: the local quilting bee?
text: Audience LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm no stranger to the notion of
dialog: philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has
dialog: long been one of my idols.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: What about the future? You planning
dialog: to rock the boat at all? Stir
dialog: things up in "Heaven?"
dialog: Ted's so smooth. We know it's still HIM under all that
text: Armani, but it sure does make him LOOK different.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I
dialog: are planning to rethink the
dialog: magazine. To expand the traditional
dialog: western notions of "beauty."
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: I see, so you'd be open to little
dialog: ladies from Pasadena, who want to
dialog: show you their knickers?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a
text: pictorial focusing on the women of
dialog: my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia."
dialog: Just to show my appreciation.
text: OFF IN THE WINGS
text: Julie looks thoroughly disgusted.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: The Girls of Xenia? Jesus.
dialog: BACK TO STAGE
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Now you're talking. What did Andrew

scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S KITCHEN - MORNING
text: A Cocker Spaniel, POOCHIE, sits under a breakfast table,
text: holding a newspaper in his snout.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN (O.S.)
dialog: Poochie? Where's my poochie? Where
dialog: is she?
text: MRS. MERKIN, dressed in a bathrobe and curlers, prepares
text: breakfast. Their beautiful college-aged daughter, JUDY, eats
text: cereal at the table, while flipping through a glamour
text: magazine. Principal Merkin enters. Ready for work. Wife and
text: daughter don't even look up.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Is my Poochie in here?
text: Principal Merkin pretends to look for the dog in the
text: cupboard. This is obviously a daily ritual.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Is she in here? No. Where on
dialog: earth could she be?
text: He looks under the table.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
dialog: There's my Poochie! There's my
dialog: girl!
text: The dog leaps into his arms. Principal Merkin grabs the
text: paper as Poochie starts to lick his face.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Poochie loves Daddy, doesn't she?
scene_heading: MRS. MERKIN
text: Breakfast is getting cold.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Thank you, dear.
scene_heading: MRS. MERKIN
text: No dogs at the table.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: I know, dear.
text: Principal Merkin places the dog on the ground, takes a seat,
text: and bites into a breakfast sausage. He opens the paper and
text: is confronted by a full page ad.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER AD
text: "GIRLS OF XENIA, GO STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN!" Details follow.
dialog: How, when, where to apply.
text: BACK TO PRINCIPAL MERKIN
text: Who chokes on his sausage. Clutches his throat. Signaling to
text: his wife and daughter. "Help me!" Judy looks up, grossed out.
text: Mrs. Merkin attempts the Heimlich Maneuver. Rather ineptly.
text: Principal Merkin turns red, blue, purple. Finally the piece
text: of sausage flies out of his mouth, past Judy. Poochie catches
text: it in mid-flight.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Thatta girl.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S HONDA CIVIC - MOVING - DAY
text: Principal Merkin drives to work, humming along to Liza

speaker_heading: RADIO SPOT (V.O.)
dialog: How many times have people told
dialog: you, "Jeepers, you look swell
dialog: naked!" Well now's your chance to
dialog: go straight to "Heaven!"
text: Principal Merkin tries to change the station. But the ad
dialog: seems to be on every station...
speaker_heading: RADIO SPOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on down for "The Girls of

dialog: ones with great udders.
scene_heading: INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

scene_heading: INT. CITY COUNCIL HALL - EVENING
text: Hundreds of Xenia CITIZENS have gathered for this meeting.
text: Principal Merkin stands in front of the five members of the
text: city council who sit at a U-shaped table. He holds up
text: "Heaven" magazine. Preaching with an evangelical passion...
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: This, my friends, this is not
dialog: "Heaven." This flesh rag is a one
dialog: way ticket to hell! We must voice
dialog: our outrage! To remain passive in
dialog: the eye of the devil is like
dialog: inviting him to a pot luck in your
dialog: own backyard and asking him to
dialog: bring the three-bean salad!
text: His supporters murmur agreement.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN(CONT'D)
dialog: For the sake of this community, and
dialog: its impressionable young minds, I
dialog: propose this publication be banned
dialog: from our city!
text: His POSSE of supporters APPLAUD. His opponents GROAN. Ted
text: slouches nearby. A lawyer next to him. The MAYOR bangs the
text: gavel and the commotion settles.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Thank you for that long-winded but
dialog: impassioned speech, Mr. Merkin. I
dialog: hope you can cut to the chase, Ted.
text: Principal Merkin takes his seat. Ted rises. Playing the big
text: shot lawyer. Julie sits in the crowd, taking notes.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: With all due respect to Merk, he
dialog: doesn't have to read my magazine.
dialog: But he has no right to stop others.
dialog: (to Principal Merkin)
dialog: Ever hear of the First Amendment?
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: (rising; an outburst)
dialog: We cannot afford free speech if it
dialog: excises the moral fiber of this
dialog: community!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: If that were true, this would be
text: one seriously constipated town.
dialog: Most guys in Xenia have been
text: looking at naked girls in "Heaven"
dialog: since they were old enough to
dialog: figure out their dads hide it under
dialog: the mattress.
text: A bit of an UPROAR from the crowd. WOMEN eye their HUSBANDS
text: suspiciously. Julie makes a point...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Isn't it true, Principal Merkin,
dialog: that you only care now because
text: "Heaven" is suddenly too close to
dialog: home?
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Indeed it is, Miss Conroy! I make
dialog: no bones about it! "Heaven" has
dialog: gone too far!
text: MR. NEEDLEMAN, another angry man from Principal Merkin's
text: posse, jumps on the bandwagon.
speaker_heading: MR. NEEDLEMAN
dialog: Principal Merkin is right! We can't
dialog: let "Heaven" violate our own
dialog: daughters, wives, sisters, mothers,
dialog: girlfriends, aunts...
text: Helen motions to Ted. He quickly locates a page in the report
text: she prepared for him. He handles this like a pro...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I wouldn't want to name names, Mr.
dialog: Needleman, or cause any undue
dialog: embarrassment. But many members of
dialog: this community have been loyal
dialog: "Heaven" readers for the better
dialog: part of the last two decades. Not
dialog: to mention certain charter
dialog: subscribers who have developed a
dialog: voracious appetite for our video
dialog: library as well. I don't suppose,
dialog: "Courtney Leaves The Convent" rings
dialog: a bell to anyone?
text: Mr. Needleman dissolves into his seat. Half the men in the
text: audience seem to evaporate.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Mr. Nelson, you are Beelzebub's
dialog: henchman! You are single-handedly
dialog: destroying the integrity of our
dialog: community, and I will not have it!
dialog: I'll gather signatures. I'll
dialog: petition the courts.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: You do what you have to do, Dick.
dialog: But if there's a man among us who
dialog: doesn't like to steal a look at

scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: I'm an adult. I can do whatever I

scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: My roof, my rules, young lady.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Send us a picture, sugar. We'll
dialog: get back to you.
text: The stack of flyers FLOATS over the railing and onto the

text: the building lobby. They excitedly reach for the flyers.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - XENIA - DAY
text: A line of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - all shapes and sizes - snakes

scene_heading: INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Hi, Teddy Bear.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Christy? You want to be in
dialog: "Heaven?"
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I turned eighteen over spring

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: With a refrigerated cargo bed full

scene_heading: INT. TED'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Highly modified since the last time we saw it. A large flat

speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: So far, so good. Some of them have
dialog: real Angel potential.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Really? So I'm doing OK?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: We're impressed but not surprised,
dialog: Ted. You have your father's
dialog: impeccable judgment.
text: Dad passes the partially open door. Overhearing. He stops.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: My father must've been amazing.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: He was in a league of his own.
text: Suddenly Ted feels his dad's presence, behind him.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Sorry I--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's okay. You need me?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: (holding a list)
dialog: Your mom said you've been ignoring

text: Ted takes the list. Gives it a cursory glance. Nods to his
text: dad, as if dismissing him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: No problem, consider it done.
dialog: (to Uncle Billy)
dialog: I had this idea of shooting on
dialog: location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe
text: at some famous Xenia landmarks.
dialog: You think that would be a problem?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: We'll send you the release forms,
dialog: Ted. Our staffers will help in any
dialog: way they can.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You're the Titan of Tushies, the
dialog: General of Jism. Don't you forget
dialog: it, Ted-baby.
text: Ted laughs. Completely ignoring his dad. Who backs out of the
text: room. Unnoticed. Neglected. Hurt.
scene_heading: EXT. THE NELSON HOUSE - DAY
text: Mom drives up to the house. She stares, aghast.
text: There are tall, beautiful, ANGELS everywhere. One cuts the
text: grass. Another pulls weeds. Two others on the roof, cleaning
text: gutters.
text: Still others wash the car...with Jimmy handling the water
text: hose. Drenching the women, more than the car. Shrieks and
text: giggles all around. Neighbors gawk.
text: Ted's dad guiltily enjoys the view, but quickly rushes to his
text: wife. She gets out of her car and steadies herself on his
dialog: arm.
scene_heading: INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Ted stands on an ottoman as a TAILOR fits him for a prom
text: tuxedo. He towers over his parents who try to talk to him. We
text: feel for them. They've lost control of their kid.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You have to understand. This was a
dialog: big shock, for all of us. One
dialog: minute you're our little boy, of
dialog: whom we could not be more proud.
dialog: The next minute you're the owner of
dialog: this whole pornographic empire.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: But that doesn't make you the boss
dialog: of everything, son.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Don't you see how your self
dialog: involvement and lack of humility
dialog: are affecting the whole family?
text: Ted looks down at them, literally.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I paid off the mortgage! I ordered
dialog: that Winnebago you always wanted!
dialog: Now you're ashamed of me?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You ordered a Winnebago?
dialog: Mom gives Dad a look. Stick to the script. Don't be swayed by

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We miss you. We miss our son.
speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: We think you should give up the

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: We want you to go to college, find
dialog: a career you love, marry a nice
dialog: girl from a nice family, and live
dialog: happily ever after.

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: THAT is your dream, not mine. My

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Watch your tone, mister.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Why don't you just admit what this
dialog: is really all about? I'm not your
dialog: real kid and you can't control me
dialog: anymore.
text: Mom and Dad look stricken. Ted doesn't know when to stop...
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: No wonder I was so bored. No wonder
dialog: I hated this one-horse cow town. I
dialog: come from talented people who took
dialog: chances and dared to imagine a life
dialog: without limits! I was never meant
text: to be raised by...GROCERS.
text: Ted storms away, unintentionally CRASHING into a TREASURED
text: FAMILY PHOTO on the end table. The frame shatters into

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
text: Prom night. Couples slow dance to a Marilyn Manson clone,

text: Principal Merkin watches on the sidelines. Surprisingly

text: Ted caresses Ginger's bare back as they dance together. His
text: head nestled against her breasts. Not a care in the world.
text: He spots Charlie on the dance floor. Making out with one of
text: his dates, the IDENTICAL TAYLOR TRIPLETS, while the other two
text: patiently wait their turn.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Teddy? I was thinking.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hmmm?
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: After graduation...maybe we could
dialog: go away together?
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: GINGER

speaker_heading: GINGER (CONT'D)
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: You could have warned us.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oops, sorry. Warning: You've got
dialog: lipstick on your teeth.
text: Julie flashes the camera again. Capturing Ginger's panicked

text: purple strapless gown. Not so glamorous as Ginger, but far
text: more appealing and natural.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Wow...you clean up nice.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Put your eyeballs back in your

speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Teddy, I thought we were having a

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Of course we were.
text: Suddenly the music dies. Everyone turns to the stage where

scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: I apologize for interrupting the

speaker_heading: TED

scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Rules are rules.
speaker_heading: TED

scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to

scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Out! Now!
text: Ted realizes his high school reputation is at stake. He steps
text: up on stage. Approaches Principal Merkin. Takes out his
dialog: wallet.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What's your price, Merk? How much
dialog: will it cost to make you go bye
dialog: bye?
text: The crowd CHEERS.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: You're crossing the line, Mr.
dialog: Nelson.
speaker_heading: TED
text: A statue in front of city hall,
dialog: dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: I'm warning you.
speaker_heading: TED
text: A new pediatric wing at the
dialog: hospital? A presidential campaign?
dialog: Name it. Anything.
text: Principal Merkin trembles from the sheer temptation of it.
dialog: Yet he could never succumb in front of so many witnesses. He
dialog: has to maintain his dignity...
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: That's it! You're out of here!
text: From nowhere, a flock of beefy SECURITY GUARDS emerge to
dialog: remove Ted & Co.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Good-bye, Mr. Nelson. Have a
dialog: pleasant evening.
text: The Marilyn Manson clone is rapidly whisked away, and
text: replaced by six GEEZERS in powder blue tuxedoes.
text: As Security Guards carry them away...
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Ted! Do something!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (restrained)
dialog: What do you want me to do?
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: This is humiliating. We're being
dialog: ejected from a prom!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hang in there, I'll think of
dialog: something.
text: As they reach the doors...
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I guess...I don't know...I guess we
dialog: should leave if we're not wanted.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I hear you, bro. We're Angus men in
text: a ground round town.
speaker_heading: GINGER
dialog: This is what I get for playing den
dialog: mother in "Romper Room." Take me to
dialog: the airport, Charlie!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why don't you just hitch a ride on
dialog: the horse you rode in on?
text: Ginger storms away in an angry huff.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: Don't forget your broom!
text: Ted experiences a moment of loss.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I thought I loved her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Chicks are like buses. If you miss
dialog: one, don't sweat it. There's
text: another coming 'round the corner.
text: One of the Taylor Triplets bats her lashes at Ted.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering to Ted)
dialog: Take your pick. They're IDENTICAL.
text: Ted grins broadly. He turns and SHOUTS to his classmates...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Everybody, listen up! This prom
dialog: sucks! Let's party at my place!
text: Responses are mixed. Some cheer, some are undecided. Until
text: the new band starts playing, "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the
text: Old Oak Tree." And EVERYONE RUSHES for the exit, following
dialog: Ted.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: A muzak version of "Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak
text: Tree," continues. A PIZZA DELIVERY GUY watches the numbers
text: rise to the penthouse. Suddenly the doors open to reveal...
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: All four penthouse suites have been rented by Ted. It's
text: party central. Very wild. Quickly growing out of control.
text: Kids dance, play drinking games, Spin the Bottle, and
dialog: generally trash the place.
text: The pizza delivery guy wheels a dolly with a huge stack of
text: pizzas into the party, only to be attacked by the prom-goers
text: like starving beasts. Grabbing the pizzas. Devouring them
text: hungrily.
scene_heading: TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE
text: Ted, Charlie, the Taylor Triplets and several buddies lounge
text: around, drunkenly watching THE HOME SHOPPING CHANNEL on Ted's
text: big screen TV. A tacky CERAMIC GNOME rotates on the screen.
text: Ted swigs Dom Perignon straight from the bottle. He shouts
text: orders into his cell phone...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen
dialog: of 'em!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, leave one. Somebody's
dialog: grandmother might want one.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And while you're at it, I'll take
dialog: ten dozen of those puppies with the
text: springy heads.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I love those springy head puppies!
scene_heading: CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ted looks up as the elevator doors open. Principal Merkin
text: has arrived. Ted confronts him...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You kicked us off your turf, Merk.
dialog: Don't rain on our parade.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me.
dialog: First you break our school board
dialog: rules. Then you break the law.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting
dialog: down our hair on prom night?
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Our state has a zero tolerance
dialog: policy for underage drinking.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You called the cops on us?
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Alcohol does horrible things to a
text: developing young mind.
text: Suddenly the whole XENIA POLICE FORCE appears, in full riot
text: gear. The party's over. Everyone runs for the stairs. Ted
text: gives Principal Merkin a spiteful look and joins the mass
dialog: exodus.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLIDAY INN - NIGHT
text: Drunken teenagers pour out of the building. Dashing for
text: their cars and limos. Ted's among them. Suddenly he's cut
text: off by a Harley that stops right in front of him. It's
text: Julie. Still in her purple strapless prom dress. With a
text: black motorcycle jacket over it.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Need a lift?
text: Ted jumps on, wrapping his arms around her waist. Julie takes
dialog: off.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF XENIA - CONTINUOUS
text: Julie maneuvers the nighttime streets of Xenia, taking off
text: down a country road.
speaker_heading: TED (V.O.)
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: JULIE (V.O.)
dialog: To the best hiding place in the
dialog: world.
scene_heading: EXT. JULIE'S BACKYARD - NIGHT
dialog: Now we understand. Julie's family comes from major bucks. The
text: yard is massive. And resting in a sprawling oak tree is the
dialog: best hiding place in the world.
scene_heading: INT. JULIE'S TREE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A cozy oasis. Books everywhere. A whole series of
text: flashlights hang upside down like lanterns. Giving the tree
text: house a warm glow.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I can't believe your dad built this
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: He didn't. He had it built.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Not "whatever." It's two different
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: He cared enough to want you to have
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: He phoned it in.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I doubt it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Now it makes sense, the whole neo
text: Bohemian, down with hypocrisy,
dialog: fight the power crap. You're a poor
dialog: little rich girl.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: The ozone must be fully depleted on
dialog: Planet Ted.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You think my dad would have been
dialog: like that if I knew him? You think
dialog: he would have bought me a stadium,
dialog: instead of teaching me how to play
dialog: ball?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Your dad taught you everything.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I mean my father.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: A father is nothing but sperm, Ted.
dialog: It takes a real man to be a dad.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's all so complicated.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: It's incredibly simple.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I feel like I'm being drawn and
dialog: quartered. Like every part of me is
text: being pushed and pulled and tugged
text: in a different direction.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Eventually you'll let go.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And then what?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Then you'll see who's really
dialog: holding on to you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You're amazing.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Even when you infuriate me, I still
dialog: want to kiss you.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: But you never do.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: If we were a team, we could do
dialog: anything. I mean, anything.
text: Julie's eyes narrow. She should have known.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: Cut to the chase, William Randolph.
dialog: Your audience is way ahead of you.
speaker_heading: TED
text: In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That's two words. And I'm out of
dialog: the "exposed" business, remember? I
dialog: need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a
dialog: boy scout.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: There's gotta be something. We have
dialog: to dig deeper.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You forget, I dislike YOU at least
dialog: as much as him.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: He shut down your paper! You're
dialog: stuck writing articles about swap
text: meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
dialog: He's right, but...
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: A good journalist can take lemons
dialog: and make lemonade. I'm honing my
dialog: craft.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Then you won't mind covering that
dialog: watermelon seed spitting contest
dialog: next week...
text: Julie groans.
scene_heading: INT. OLD FOLK'S HOME - NIGHT
text: Dressed in a old fashioned barber costume, complete with a
text: handle bar mustache, Principal Merkin sings as part of a
text: BARBER SHOP QUARTET. The senior citizens clap
text: enthusiastically.
text: Ted and Julie peek through a crack in the doorway.
text: Disappointment on their faces.
scene_heading: INT. SOUP KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT
text: Principal Merkin pours soup into the bowl of a shabbily
text: dressed HOMELESS MAN. Julie shoots Ted an "I told you so"
dialog: look.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - SATURDAY AFTERNOON
text: Principal Merkin supervises a crew of kindergarten CHILDREN,
text: cleaning up the roadside litter. Julie and Ted watch from...
text: A BRIDGE ABOVE THE HIGHWAY
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: See what I mean. He's squeaky
text: clean. He makes Gandhi look like a
dialog: war monger.
text: Ted steels himself. Somehow, they'll get him.
scene_heading: EXT. XENIA - WATER TOWER - DAY
text: In the golden light of sunset, MOLLY, a stunning "Xenia
text: Girl," stands on the stairs that curve up around a huge water
text: tower that overlooks the city. Her loose spring dress
text: billows in the wind. Held on by only one button. Exposing in
text: quick glimpses that she isn't wearing a bra.
text: An ASSISTANT holds a portable strobe, attached to a
text: reflector. Charlie shoots with his Nikon. Motor drive
text: whirling.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I have a great idea. Let's lose
text: the last button.
text: Molly grins. Then unbuttons. We hear a round of "oohs" from
text: below. Ted glances down, where...
text: Hundreds of binoculars, cameras, and camcorders are poised on
text: the scene. Men of all ages are milling around, gawking,
text: focusing their long lenses. Women are conspicuously absent.
text: Except for the gaggle of hardcore FEMINISTS with their
text: placards, denouncing "Heaven."
text: One Feminist approaches the Mayor.
speaker_heading: FEMINIST
dialog: The city tower belongs to the city,
dialog: not to some pornographer.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: The library also belongs to the
dialog: city. And guess what? It's going
dialog: to have a new Ted Nelson wing with
dialog: three thousand children's books.
text: The Feminist tries to respond, but a helicopter swoops
text: overhead, drowning out her words. The helicopter rises to the
text: level of the photo shoot where the door slides open. And
dialog: just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core
dialog: fans who wanted a closer look, we find Principal Merkin
text: frowning as he barks through a bullhorn.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: You should be ashamed, young lady!
dialog: Your body is a sacred temple!
text: Molly flashes him. Principal Merkin averts his eyes. Missing
text: the sight of Molly's dress being blown off her body by the
text: chopper's prop wash. The spectators below APPLAUD. They
text: watch in amazement as her dress floats down to them.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Young lady, I will pray for god's
dialog: mercy upon your soul.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Don't bother, Merk! I'm already
dialog: going to "Heaven!"
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: Get them together.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (eyes lighting up)
dialog: Brilliant! Molly, give me all
dialog: you've got. For Merk.
text: Molly gets the idea. She poses provocatively towards
text: Principal Merkin, who suddenly realizes he's in a
text: compromising position.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Stop that, stop that this instant!
text: But Molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him.
scene_heading: INT. TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - DESK AREA - THAT NIGHT
text: Uncle Billy chortles, his image glowing on a large flat
text: screen monitor that hangs on the wall. Ted leans back in his
dialog: chair.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I never saw anybody turn so many
text: shades of red.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: I can't wait to see the pictures.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It was incredible. The light, the
dialog: crowd, everything.
text: Uncle Billy grins proudly at Ted.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Such enthusiasm. Have I told you
dialog: lately how proud I am of you?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Seriously? I'm doing all right?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You're taking this bull of an
dialog: empire by the horns, but you're
dialog: still keeping your small town
dialog: values. You're not letting all this
dialog: "stuff" spoil you.
text: Ted knows it's not true. He looks guilty.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I owe it all to you. Without your
dialog: help I'd be lost.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: I wish I knew you years ago, when
dialog: my brother was alive. I wish he
dialog: never gave you up.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to
dialog: say...you can't change your
dialog: Christmas past, but you sure can
dialog: exchange your Christmas presents.
text: Uncle Billy forces a laugh.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Why don't you come to town this
dialog: weekend? We could play some golf,
text: chase some skirts.
text: Ted smiles at the appealing offer.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'd love to, but I really need to
dialog: crack the books. Final exams are
dialog: coming up and I've been slacking.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You're right. I should work, too.
dialog: Our first issue together is almost
text: ready to print.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: You're a great kid. Don't you
dialog: forget it.
text: With that, he's gone. The room is completely silent. And Ted
text: is completely alone.
text: UNTIL the doorbell CHIMES.
scene_heading: TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT
text: Ted opens the door. It's Jimmy, with his shiny new bike.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: James, what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl
dialog: Petersen said James sounds too
dialog: pretentious.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine
dialog: years old, what does she know?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: She knew exactly where you were
dialog: staying, which you neglected to
dialog: tell me, your own brother.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's really late...do your parents
dialog: know where you are?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Mom and Dad think I'm tucked safely
dialog: in bed and that's all they need to
dialog: know. Will this discussion be
text: continuing in the hallway, or
dialog: somewhere slightly more inviting?
scene_heading: TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM
text: Jimmy seems impressed by the opulence. He takes off his bike
text: helmet, looks around.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Impressive. This is bigger than our
dialog: whole house.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Most places are, Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: They say money can't buy happiness
dialog: but this is a reasonably good
dialog: facsimile.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: So, what brings you here at his
dialog: hour?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: My new bike.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Very funny.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I came to ask permission to take
dialog: custody of your room.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: My room?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Better view, more spacious, new
text: carpet. It's a no-brainer.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It's not up to me.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Mom and Dad said it's yours. They
dialog: seem to think you're coming home.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You can have it, then. I'm not
dialog: going back there.
text: Jimmy whips out a piece of paper from his pocket.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: If you could just sign right there.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You want it in writing?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Just a formality.
text: Ted signs. Jimmy squirrels away the paper, excitedly. Starts
text: to zip up his wind breaker.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's it? I mean, you don't want
dialog: to order room service or anything?
dialog: We could play games and watch
dialog: movies and stuff.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Are you kidding? Mom and Dad
dialog: discover I'm gone and I'll be doing
dialog: hard time.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Are they okay?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes
text: are nearly swollen shut from crying
dialog: and Dad spends all his time under
text: the car trying to fix stuff that
dialog: isn't broken, things couldn't be
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I miss them, too.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You can't come back. That is, you
dialog: can, but your things will be in the
dialog: room you currently think of as
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You're a peach.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Funny you should say that. My
dialog: Grandfather was a peach farmer.
dialog: Ouch. For the first time, that really smarts.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: He was my Grandfather, too.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I meant biologically.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's a crappy thing to say.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Look Ted. I'm cool with everything.
dialog: You've long been dissatisfied with
dialog: our mediocre little town. You've
dialog: always had an itch for the good
dialog: life. I'm happy for you. This
dialog: couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
text: Ted listens.
speaker_heading: JIMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: But just for the record, my Mom is
dialog: a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad
dialog: is the best damn auto mechanic this
dialog: side of the Himalayas. You seem to
dialog: have forgotten they opened Nelson's
dialog: FAMILY Market so they could build
dialog: something permanent, a legacy, for
dialog: us. Their kids.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I didn't forget.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You ever look down on them again
dialog: and call them "grocers" like it's a
dialog: dirty word, and you'll be sucking
dialog: your filet mignon through a straw
dialog: for six to eight weeks. Got it?
text: Ted's stunned. Talk about tough love.
speaker_heading: TED
text: Loud and clear.
text: Suddenly the phone rings. Ted sheepishly explains...
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: That's probably my office.
scene_heading: INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Well? Where the hell are you?
text: INTERCUT BETWEEN TED AND JULIE
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: He's on the move?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I got an anonymous tip and an
dialog: address in Cincinnati.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Let's do it.
scene_heading: TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT
text: Ted hangs up the phone. Looks around. Jimmy's gone. But his
text: SHINY NEW BIKE is left behind.
scene_heading: INT. CINCINNATI NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
text: Not much of a place. A middle-aged TORCH SINGER croons "MY
text: ROMANCE." Ted and Julie find their way to corner table.
text: Keeping an eye out for Principal Merkin.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I don't know. This place seems
dialog: pretty tame.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You expected whips, chains, Merk
dialog: being cattle-prodded by some
dialog: dominatrix in a leather hood?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: At least it's not another 4-H
text: meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Amen to that.
text: Their heads are very close together. A conspiratorial tête-à
dialog: tête.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look at us. It's one o'clock in the
dialog: morning, on a school night. We're
text: in a smoky nightclub, hoping to
dialog: catch our principal with some big
dialog: city tart.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: I'm trembling with excitement.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That has more to do with your
dialog: proximity to me.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (playing along)
dialog: My desire betrays me, like
text: goosebumps on my flesh.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I have a bit of a goosebump fetish.
dialog: Not many people know that.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I figured you for more of a hairy
text: armpit guy.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Shoes, if you want to know the
dialog: truth. Shoes are my thing.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Wearing them? Or humping them?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: My fantasy is a totally naked
text: woman, wearing nothing but a Timex
text: and suede clogs.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That's refreshingly deviant.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm very aural.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Tell me more.
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: Sounds, voices, music, humming. All
dialog: of it can turn me on, or off, like
text: a switch.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (feigning a deep voice)
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I had a Portuguese boyfriend who
dialog: could read the phone book and melt
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (jealous)
dialog: A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very
dialog: "Cosmo."
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You live and learn. I realized the
dialog: most important thing to me, above
dialog: all, is trust.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh?
dialog: I saw that one coming.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You lose trust in someone and it's
text: over, done, gone, forever.
text: At that moment, the TORCH SINGER begins crooning "PEOPLE."
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Do you trust me, Julie?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Not a chance.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Trust is something you earn, over
dialog: time. You don't just inherit it
dialog: overnight like a gazillion dollar
dialog: empire.
text: Ted leans even closer. Looking into her eyes. Using his
text: voice. Being as aurally seductive as he can.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I want you to trust me.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Maybe someday.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Julie, I'll tell you something that
dialog: is the god's honest truth. I've
dialog: seen a lot of really beautiful
dialog: girls. I mean a lot. But none of
dialog: them make me feel like you do.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That's hard to believe.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: But absolutely true.
text: Ted moves closer. Julie doesn't move away. The SINGER seems
dialog: to be performing just for them.
speaker_heading: SINGER (O.S.)
dialog: ..."A feeling deep in your
dialog: soul/Says you were half, now you're
dialog: whole..."
text: Just as Ted and Julie are about to kiss, Julie's eyes widen.
text: She grabs Ted's hand. Simultaneously, they turn towards THE
text: SINGER...
speaker_heading: JULIE & TED
scene_heading: OH. MY. GOD.
dialog: It's the Mother Lode! That's not just any middle-aged torch
text: singer. That's Principal Merkin. Dressed in drag as Barbra
dialog: Streisand. And doing a mighty fine job of it.
text: Ted pulls out his camera and fires away. Blinded by the stage
text: lights, Principal Merkin sings and vogues glamorously. He has
text: no idea his secret is out.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHTCLUB/CINCINNATI STREET - NIGHT
text: Ted and Julie rush down the street in the rain, giggling,
text: totally euphoric. They stop to catch their breath. Their
text: clothes are drenched, but they couldn't care less. In no time
text: they've got their arms wrapped around one another, kissing
text: and laughing.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We just found the ULTIMATE
dialog: centerfold for "The Girls of
dialog: Xenia!"
text: Suddenly Julie sobers, pulls away.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I have to be honest with you, Ted.
dialog: I really despise "The Girls of
dialog: Xenia."
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I know, their small town mentality
dialog: can be maddening.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I mean your pictorial. It bothers
dialog: me, profoundly.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like
dialog: being a doctor.
text: Julie eyes him skeptically.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You're telling me you don't get
text: aroused by a roomful of naked
dialog: breasts.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You've seen one naked breast,
dialog: you've seem them all.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Which explains the continued
dialog: success of "Heaven" for how many
dialog: decades?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You're quick. I like that.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: You think you're working with
dialog: chimps here?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The thing is, I made a commitment.
dialog: I said I'd do it and I have to keep
dialog: my word.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Keeping your word is something I
dialog: can actually respect, Ted.

speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I have to admit, I am so totally
dialog: turned on. We should do it. Now.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Do it?
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You know...take the pictures?
text: Christy does her warm-up contortionist poses for Ted.
text: Clothes still on. As reflectors bounce strobes into the
dialog: shower area.
text: Years of being a merciless tease, paying off right here and
dialog: now. Christy knows how to make love to the camera.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I remember the first time you
text: walked into Mrs. Temple's class in
text: 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress.
text: Blond ponytail.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Which you pulled, hard!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That was code for "I like you."
text: Christy giggles.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Wanna unzip me?
text: Ted slowly unzips Christy's top, catching a glimpse of her
text: long, sensuous back. She resumes posing. Flashing a bare
text: shoulder. A coy look. She doesn't need direction. She's a
dialog: natural.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember dress up day? You and
text: Charlie lifting skirts during
dialog: recess.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I miss those days, when schoolyard
dialog: sexual harassment was without
dialog: consequence.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Things change. Now I'm taking off
dialog: my clothes...all by myself.
text: Christy slips off her cheerleader top. Lowers her skirt.
text: Flings it aside. She's wearing only panties the size of a
text: Band-aid. Ted is mute. Staring at her perfect body.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You have changed since second
dialog: grade.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I mean, what do you think?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You expect me to think at a time
dialog: like this? There isn't a drop of
dialog: blood in my brain.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
text: Ted steps out of the shower. Out of Christy's sight, he
text: squirms in his jeans. Trying to hide his enthusiasm.
text: MUSIC suddenly seems to come from nowhere. Nine Inch Nails.
dialog: "I Want to Fuck You Like An Animal."
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: God help me.
text: Ted steps back into the shower. Christy rubs an ice cube on
text: her left nipple.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I heard they do this on photo
dialog: shoots. Wanna to do the other one?
text: She tosses him the ice cube. He fumbles. It lands on the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You're doing just fine, Christy.
dialog: Believe me.
speaker_heading: CHRITY
dialog: Then I'm ready when you are.
text: Ted looks through the lens. We can see him trembling. Music
text: blasts as Ted's camera burns through film. They're both
text: getting into it. Water pulsating over her body. Steam
text: rising. Christy begins lathering her breasts.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: I was always too shy to admit how
dialog: much I liked you.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Come on, I was hamburger. You were
dialog: porterhouse.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
text: Maybe on the outside. But inside,
dialog: deep down, I've always been
text: dripping with special sauces.
dialog: (she smiles, sexily)
dialog: Are you hungry?
dialog: Is he hungry. He's been working up this appetite for ten
text: years. He can barely contain himself.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: God, you are so hot.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Then you better get in the water,
dialog: before you get burned.
text: Ted calls her bluff. He sets aside his camera. Walks right
text: into the water. Through the steam. Toward Christy. She wraps
text: a leg around him, sucking face, wanting more.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY (CONT'D)
dialog: You and me, finally. This will be
dialog: so fantastic, Teddy Bear. Trust me.
text: Suddenly Ted stops. Remembering what Julie said about trust.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm sorry, Christy. I've been crazy
dialog: about you forever, and this is
dialog: definitely a page right out of my
dialog: palm pilot, but I just can't go
dialog: through with it.
text: He turns away, but Christy presses her bare body against his
text: back. Wrapping her hands around his waist. Caressing his
text: chest, his stomach...
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Sure you can. You're only human.
dialog: It's not like you're made of steel.
dialog: (she lowers her hand)
dialog: Or ARE you?
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: Ted and Christy locked in a steamy embrace. Rolling on the
text: floor. Hands, arms, lips, tongues, all in motion. As the
text: shower drenches them.
text: Suddenly, they roll into a pair of legs. Both look up. The
text: steam clears to reveal Julie. Arms crossed. Hurt, but not
dialog: surprised.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What's up, doc?
text: She doesn't wait for an explanation. Christy covers herself.
text: Ted chases after Julie.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Wait, Julie, wait!
scene_heading: INT. TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Julie dashes out of the girls' locker room, passing a
text: JANITOR. Ted follows, dripping water.
speaker_heading: JANITOR
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Ted. She pushed
dialog: right past me.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (calling after Julie)
dialog: At least let me explain!
text: Julie darts into the girls' restroom. Ted stops at the door.
text: Then realizes there is no one else around. He heads inside.
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS' RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Julie's too proud to let him see her cry. But we can tell
text: she's upset.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Go away, Ted. Just go.
text: Ted corners her near a row of sinks.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Please believe me. It was just a
dialog: kiss for old time's sake. I've had
dialog: a stupid crush on her since I was
dialog: seven, but I never got closer to
dialog: her than four feet and then there
text: she was right in front of me,
text: completely naked.
text: Julie looks at him, pensively. She unzips the back of her
text: summery dress. And lets it fall to the floor. She's
text: completely naked and absolutely gorgeous.
text: Ted gasps. He's been around dozens of naked women by now, but
text: this one he can't just gawk at. This one he really cares
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Being naked is no big deal. It has
dialog: nothing to do with emotion, nothing
dialog: to do with love. You can be around
dialog: all the naked girls you want and
dialog: you won't be even one step closer
dialog: to anything meaningful in your
dialog: life.
text: She puts on her dress, gracefully. As if nothing happened.
speaker_heading: JULIE (CONT'D)
dialog: See that? You don't know me even
dialog: one ounce better than you did
dialog: before. You and your stupid
dialog: magazine. I liked you better when
dialog: you were sweet and kind and human,
dialog: like the rest of us.
text: At that moment, Ted's cell phone rings. Julie walks away,
text: leaving Ted completely alone. He answers, lifelessly...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY (O.S.)
dialog: We've got a huge problem with the
dialog: magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers
dialog: hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Ted walks down the hallway. Three JOCKS look through the new
text: issue of "Heaven." Laughing. They taunt Ted.
speaker_heading: JOCK #1
dialog: You got a great sense of humor. I
dialog: love the three hundred pound Eskimo
dialog: chick.
speaker_heading: JOCK #2
dialog: You like Eskimo pie, Teddy?
speaker_heading: JOCK #3
dialog: I like the African chick with the
dialog: big lip. You could stash a lot of
dialog: weed in there. Maybe even a six
dialog: pack.
text: Ted's mortified, depressed. Charlie appears next to him with
dialog: "Heaven" in hand.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Holy stinkers, what were you
dialog: thinking?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: We wanted to challenge the notions
dialog: of classic beauty. We wanted to
dialog: showcase women throughout the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Next time, make sure you put a barf
text: bag in the centerfold.
text: Principal Merkin approaches. Also holding "Heaven" in his
dialog: hand.
scene_heading: PRINCIPAL MERKIN
dialog: Ted, I realize I owe you an
dialog: apology. You're destroying "Heaven"
dialog: much faster from the inside than I
dialog: ever could from the outside. Good
dialog: job, son.
dialog: Ted could not feel worse.
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: Ted, Uncle Billy, and Helen. Meeting with the HEADS OF
scene_heading: VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS.
text: HEAD OF MARKETING
text: Our advertisers are wigging out.
text: Half of them are threatening to
dialog: pull their ads for next month. The
dialog: other half already did.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: It was nothing more than beginner's
dialog: folly. Tell everyone to lighten up.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: It's a little more serious than
dialog: that, Bill. The stockholders have
dialog: requested a meeting. They want our
dialog: guarantee that this will never
dialog: happen again.
dialog: (the words pain her)
dialog: Some of them are even calling for
text: Ted's resignation.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Look, the girls of Xenia are
dialog: gorgeous, you'll see. Next month
dialog: we'll be back to normal.
speaker_heading: HEAD OF FINANCE
dialog: Another disaster like this could
dialog: sink us. We've got thousands of
dialog: subscribers requesting refunds.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: The kid came up with something that
dialog: sounded good on paper. Who knew our
dialog: readers wouldn't dig it?
text: Ted bristles. THE KID? The kid came up with something?
text: HEAD OF MARKETING
dialog: We tried to warn you.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Sometimes young people need to make
dialog: their own mistakes. That's how they
dialog: learn.
text: Ted can see that Uncle Billy's playing this out differently
dialog: than he imagined. Giving Ted all the "credit."
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (firmly; to Uncle Billy)
dialog: It won't happen again. It will
dialog: never happen again.
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - TED'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Ted sits at his father's desk. Going through paperwork.
text: Figures. Charts. Reports. CEO work. In the b.g., he hears
text: the PLAYFUL SOUNDS of women. Which distract him.
text: Ted approaches the window and watches a group of girls
text: splashing and playing in the pool. He looks sad. Helen enters
text: behind him. He turns to her.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I always thought I wanted fame and
dialog: fortune and beautiful women. But
dialog: sometimes your dreams come true,
dialog: and they cause you nothing but
dialog: grief. I just want to chuck
dialog: everything and sell the stupid
dialog: magazine. It's not worth the pain.
text: Helen takes Ted's hand, comfortingly.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Come, let me show you something.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION ATTIC - DAY
text: Helen and Ted sit on old trunk. Helen holds a scrapbook in
text: her arms. Explaining to Ted...
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Your parents never wanted to
dialog: interfere with your life, Ted. They
dialog: knew your Mom and Dad loved you
dialog: very much. They knew they did the
dialog: right thing. But that doesn't mean
dialog: they didn't watch you and miss you,
text: from afar.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You mean they knew who I was?
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: They kept this scrapbook of your
dialog: life. It meant the world to them.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON SCRAPBOOK
text: We see baby pictures of Ted, taken through the glass of a
text: nursery. A newspaper photo of Ted playing a donkey in a
text: nativity play. And clippings from Ted's high school
dialog: newspaper.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I wondered about them, for so many
dialog: years. I wondered if I looked like
dialog: them, acted like them. I wondered
dialog: why they gave me up.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Giving you up was the most
dialog: unselfish thing they ever did. When
dialog: they founded "Heaven," they wished
dialog: they could take you back but it was
dialog: too late.
dialog: All they could do was build the
dialog: empire, knowing that someday it
dialog: would all be yours.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: My legacy.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: Your parents would be crushed to
dialog: think you weren't happy with it.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: They're not my parents, Helen. My
dialog: parents are back in Xenia and I
dialog: hurt them very much.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: And the girl I love, she hates
dialog: "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll
dialog: never respect me.
speaker_heading: HELEN
dialog: But how can you respect yourself if
dialog: you don't?
scene_heading: INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Ted's parents and Jimmy walk through the front door. They're
text: stunned to find a huge 24x36 enlarged family portrait,
text: hanging over the mantle. It's the same picture Ted broke in
text: his childish tantrum. Mom and Dad are moved. Even more so
text: when they see Ted. Waiting for them on the couch. Ted rises.
text: Misty eyed.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Everything I am is because of you.
dialog: Can you ever forgive me?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: (hugging him)
dialog: Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You were always our number one son.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (rolling his eyes)
dialog: Mom, Dad. This display of
text: unconditional love is appalling.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: We are a FAMILY.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: A family, need I remind you, that
text: HE ridiculed and left for dead.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I will not have my boys arguing.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So, when I'm seventeen, can I turn
dialog: everyone's life upside-down, behave
text: like a total piece of canine
dialog: excrement, and then wipe the slate
text: clean with a half-baked apology and
dialog: a Kodak moment?
speaker_heading: MOM & DAD
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Which is precisely why I got the
dialog: rights to my new room IN WRITING.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: (to his parents)
dialog: I need your help. I'm really in
dialog: deep shit.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Don't say "shit," honey. Use the
dialog: strong vocabulary God gave you.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Besides, there's no problem too
dialog: deep or too shitty for us to solve.
scene_heading: INT. NELSON GROCERY STORE - DAY
text: Dad reaches for a can of peaches from the shelf.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Son, it's a simple fix. The only
dialog: difference between my store and

dialog: of zeros. Now, have I ever told you
dialog: the story about the can of peaches?
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY
text: A "Heaven" stockholders' meeting in progress. Uncle Billy
text: stands at the podium.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Ladies, gentlemen. "Heaven" has
dialog: gone to hell.
text: Behind him are charts, wall graphs. We quickly realize he is
text: a complete and utter turn-coat.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I loved my brother. I stood by his
dialog: wishes to let his son run the
dialog: company. A son he never knew. A son
dialog: that he and his wife gave away at
text: birth. A son who was raised in a
dialog: world quite different from our own.
dialog: Nevertheless, I was there for the
dialog: lad. I guided him as best I could.
text: But he's only seventeen, with a
dialog: mind of his own and judgment that
dialog: is, well, frankly, not a chip off
dialog: the old block. There is only one
dialog: clear solution...
dialog: (gesturing to himself)
dialog: And I think we all know what that
dialog: is--
speaker_heading: TED (O.S.)
scene_heading: --PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
text: Ted bursts into the meeting with his Dad. Holding up a can of
text: peaches. Suddenly hundreds of eyes are upon him. Curious,
text: bewildered.
text: Ted dashes to the podium, with passion in his soul and fire
text: in his belly.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: My job. Back off, Benedict.
text: Uncle Billy steps into the shadows as Ted looks out at the
text: crowd. He's petrified. But he takes a deep breath and finds
dialog: the courage to explain...
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: The only man I called "Dad" owns a
dialog: little grocery store in Xenia,
dialog: Ohio. He learned a lot of cool
dialog: stuff from my Grandpa, who was a
text: peach farmer in his day. Grandpa
dialog: knew the right thing to say in
dialog: every situation, and it usually
dialog: involved peaches. My dad's a lot
dialog: like him. And he taught me, you
dialog: have to focus on the peachy side of
dialog: life, not the pits.
text: Dad's eyes are filled with tears. He's never been so proud.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: There was a time when canned
dialog: peaches were the hottest, greatest
dialog: thing ever invented.
dialog: It was like a little taste of
dialog: summer, anytime you wanted. Grocery
dialog: stores couldn't keep them in stock,
dialog: they were so popular. And even
dialog: though other canned fruits like
text: pears, plums, and pineapples have
dialog: come along, people still need to
dialog: know they can get their canned
text: peaches, on the same shelf,
dialog: whenever they want them. It's
dialog: comforting, you know? It fulfills
dialog: their expectations.
text: The stockholders are listening. Uncle Billy grins nervously.
text: Unable to believe Ted is pulling this off.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: You're probably wondering if
dialog: there's a point to all this and I
dialog: guess it's just that I goofed last
dialog: month. I not only moved the canned
dialog: peaches, I restocked the shelves
dialog: with kiwi, guava, and mandarin
dialog: oranges in heavy syrup. I
dialog: challenged people's expectations.
dialog: And you can't do that to your
dialog: customers. So, I ask you for one
dialog: more chance to fix things and give
dialog: our readers back their canned
dialog: peaches.
text: The stockholders APPLAUD enthusiastically, giving Ted a
text: standing ovation. Ted turns to Uncle Billy.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for teaching me an important
dialog: lesson. What makes a family is
dialog: love, not blood.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: That's right. And guess who's the
text: new King of the Unemployment Line.
speaker_heading: UNCLE BILLY
dialog: Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone.
dialog: I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
scene_heading: INT. "HEAVEN" HEADQUARTERS - DAY
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: Ted looks at pictures. Layouts. Reads copy. Listens to his
text: staff. He seems confident. In control. Mature beyond his
text: years. The magazine goes to press. In VOICE OVER, we hear
text: Julie, reading the article about Ted that she wrote for the
dialog: school paper.
speaker_heading: JULIE (V.O.)
dialog: "It's easy to fall prey to petty
dialog: jealousy when considering the young
dialog: life of Ted Nelson. But how would
dialog: any of us behave if one day all our
dialog: dreams came true? Would we handle
dialog: it half as well? Would we find
dialog: ourselves making the same mistakes
dialog: for which we criticize him?"
text: Someone hands Ted a copy of Julie's article. He reads the
dialog: last portion of it aloud...
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: "One can only hope that Ted Nelson

scene_heading: EXT. JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Page three.
text: Intrigued, she turns to the page.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MAGAZINE
dialog: We see a special dedication, "To Julie, My Partner in Crime,
text: With All the Love in the World." Julie's eyes fill with
text: tears. She flips ahead to "The Girls of Xenia" pictorial,
dialog: only to find--
text: Principal Merkin. Singing his heart out, in drag as Barbra
text: Streisand. It's a series of shots from the Cincinnati
text: nightclub. Other shots suggestively include him with Molly in
text: the foreground, as if they posed together.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Not bad for a hack. He has a future
dialog: in yellow journalism.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He kicked major ass and you know
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. MERKIN'S HONDA CIVIC - MOVING - DAY
text: Principal Merkin drives. The RADIO plays in the b.g. As one
text: song ends, we hear the DJ say...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: This one's for you Dick Merkin of
dialog: Tecumseh High. From all your
text: students. With hugs and kisses.
text: The voice of Barbra Streisand fills the car.
scene_heading: BARBRA STREISAND (ON THE RADIO)
dialog: "People/People who need People/Are
dialog: the luckiest people in the world."
text: Principal Merkin pales. He turns off the radio. But
text: somehow, he can still hear the song. As he pulls into the
text: school parking lot, students wave enthusiastically. He waves
text: back tentatively. Anxiety rising.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Principal Merkin swings open his car door to be greeted by
text: the sound of Barbra singing her heart out through the parking
text: lot. Every student's car stereo blasts the song. Students

text: Merkin turns crimson.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL STADIUM - DAY
text: Graduation caps fall all around. People hugging, laughing,

scene_heading: INT./EXT. NELSON'S HOUSE - EVENING
text: A big graduation party in progress. But Ted sits in the
text: corner, looking sad, dejected. Julie didn't show up. He blew

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Why so melancholy?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You were born naked, wet, and

dialog: From my wise, albeit youthful,

speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're

dialog: and caviar dreams.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I decided to let Helen run the

text: Julie seems pleased.
speaker_heading: TED (CONT'D)
dialog: And I thought maybe I'd take up

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Very ambitious. I like that.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: The thing is, I'll need a first

speaker_heading: JULIE

text: All kidding aside, he speaks from the heart...
speaker_heading: TED

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I graduated from college. Did
