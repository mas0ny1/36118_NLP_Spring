speaker_heading: OVER BLACK
text: a man's voice, small, filtered by great distance:
speaker_heading: MIKE (0.S.)
dialog: Dad?... Dad?
speaker_heading: HANK (0.S.)
dialog: I can hardly hear you.
scene_heading: INT. DEERFIELD HOME - HANK AND JOAN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
text: Start very close on a phone and Hank's ear.
speaker_heading: CORPORAL VASQUEZ (0.S.)
dialog: (phone filter)
dialog: I said your son has gone AWOL.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (confused)
dialog: My son is in Iraq.
text: Widen to see HANK DEERFIELD cradling the phone, sitting on
dialog: the edge of his bed. You don't have to ask if Hank has seen
text: war, he speaks with the confidence of someone who has been
text: to hell and mapped the terrain. He keeps himself in shape
text: and is not a man who is often caught off guard, which makes
text: his confusion that much more troubling.
speaker_heading: CORPORAL VASQUEZ (0.S.)
dialog: Your son was in Iraq, sir. His unit
dialog: arrived stateside four days ago.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Soldier, if my son was back I would
dialog: sure as hell know about it.
text: JOAN DEERFIELD, Hank's wife, enters to check what's going
text: on. Joan's a good looking woman, younger than Hank.
speaker_heading: CORPORAL VASQUEZ (0.S.)
dialog: Sir, Sergeant Carnelli asked me to
dialog: tell you your son has until Sunday
dialog: to get back to the base, or he'll be
dialog: listed as absent. I'm sorry, I have
dialog: another call.
text: CLICK. Hank hangs up.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Some horse's ass. Did Mike email
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Why on earth would he do that? He
dialog: knows I can't read the darn things.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (exiting)
dialog: You really should have someone show
dialog: you sometime.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (calling after him)
dialog: Sarcasm is not your most endearing
dialog: quality, Hank.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S ATTIC OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Hank's desk sits in the corner of an unfinished attic room.
text: Hank checks his answering machine, no messages. He taps the
text: older model laptop computer on his desk; the black screen
text: disappears, revealing his email program: one message --
text: someone looking for a missing weigh bill. Hank picks up the
text: phone and presses an autodial number.
speaker_heading: MIKE (V.0.)
dialog: This is Mike, leave a message and if
dialog: I ever get a signal I'll call you
dialog: back.
dialog: Beep.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Hey, Mike, it's your old man. Heard
dialog: you're back. Give me a ring when
dialog: you get a chance.
text: Hank hangs up, considers.
scene_heading: EXT. DEERFIELD HOME -- MORNING
text: Theirs is a modest two bedroom home lying a front-yard's
text: distance off the highway. An ancient but well maintained
text: dump truck sits at the back of a long gravel drive, front
text: end jacked up. The truck door reads Deerfield Hauling.
text: Hank slides out from under the truck with a tie rod and wrench
text: in his hand. He drops the rod into the box of his 1989 Ford
text: F150 pickup, puts his wrench in the tool chest and pulls off
text: his coveralls.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: As the pickup pulls out of the drive we widen to see the
text: rows of identical houses lining the highway, most of them
dialog: proudly displaying American flags. Welcome to the town of
dialog: Munroe, Tennessee.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK PARTS STORE -- MORNING
text: Hank waits, the busted tie rod on the counter. A TV in the
text: corner plays a press conference about the state of the war.
text: STU, the 60ish salesman, returns with a new rod.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: There you go.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You're sure this one will fit.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You gotta trust somebody sometime,
dialog: Hank.
dialog: (re: TV)
dialog: Bet Mike will have some stories to
dialog: tell, won't he? Course now they can
dialog: see at night and shoot through
dialog: concrete walls, almost makes you
dialog: sorry for the ragheads. Big
dialog: difference from our day.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: What day was that?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: ...What do you mean?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Stu, unless I'm mistaken, the only
dialog: action you saw was Kent State. Shot
dialog: a school boy, didn't you?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: ...That was a riot, and I didn't
dialog: kill anybody.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah. That's what I heard.
text: Hank takes the tie rod and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF MUNROE, TENNESSEE -- MORNING
text: Hank steps out of the PARTS STORE and gets into his pickup.
text: He slows as he passes the local high school, noticing...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: HIS POV - THE HIGH SCHOOL & FLAG POLE
text: Kids entering don't notice the American flag flying upside
dialog: down.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - SCHOOL OFFICES -- MORNING
text: Hank enters to be greeted by LENORE, the cheerful
text: receptionist. The flag is clearly visible from the window.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Why hello there.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'm Hank Deerfield.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Mike's dad, I know that. You know
dialog: we are all just so proud of Mike and
dialog: our other boys serving their
dialog: country...and girls...did you know
dialog: Cheri Michaels is flying a helicopter?
text: Flunked Drivers Ed and they let her
text: fly a whirlybird.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Miss...
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Lenore.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Lenore. Have you looked out your
dialog: window this morning?
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: This window right here?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: This window right here. Do you see
dialog: anything odd? The flag?...
dialog: (nothing)
dialog: See how it's flying upside down?
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Oh, gosh, I didn't notice that. Oh
dialog: dear. Well don't you worry, I will
dialog: have that put right first thing in
dialog: the morning.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
text: It is the morning.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: We just get so busy here.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Lenore, do you happen to know what
dialog: it means, a flag flying upside down?
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: That someone's died?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: No--
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: --See, I always get that wrong.
speaker_heading: HANK
text: --That's flying at half mast.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Could mean that the person putting
dialog: it up wasn't paying a lot of
dialog: attention.
text: She laughs at her own joke, as she often does.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah, it could. But it doesn't.
dialog: Who raises the flag every morning,
dialog: the principal?
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Oh, good gosh no, he comes running
dialog: in about one minute before nine; no
dialog: it's Juan, our janitor.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (this is getting worse
dialog: by the second)
text: The janitor raises the flag. who
dialog: takes it down at night?
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Juan.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Right. So, why don't we ask Juan to
dialog: fix it right now?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Oh, I couldn't do that. He has so
dialog: much to do; you know they laid off
text: all the other janitorial staff, with
dialog: cutbacks and such, he can hardly
dialog: keep up as it is.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Fine. Then I'll do it.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: Oh, I'm afraid I can't let you handle
dialog: school property; it's an insurance
dialog: issue.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: A flag is not school property. All
dialog: flags are property of the US
dialog: government, who loan them to us under
dialog: the promise that we treat them with
dialog: respect.
speaker_heading: LENORE
dialog: No, I'm pretty sure we bought that
dialog: one. I know because I had to order
dialog: it when we threw the old one in the
dialog: trash.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: In the trash. Listen, before I get
dialog: myself in a lot trouble, why don't
dialog: you just tell me where to find Juan?
scene_heading: INT. BOYS' RESTROOM -- MORNING
text: Flooded, Hank stands in an inch of brown water. JUAN drops
text: his pipe wrench back into his toolkit on the sink. Juan has
text: a Mayan face and speaks with the accent of an immigrant.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Now?
text: Hank slips him a ten dollar bill.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'd really appreciate it.
text: Juan shrugs and heads out, wiping his hands. Hank takes a
text: long look at the mess before exiting.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FLAG POLE -- MORNING
text: Juan reattaches the flag. Hank snags the tip just before it
text: hits the grass.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You don't let it touch the ground.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Where are you from?
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: El Salvador.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: What's your flag look like?
speaker_heading: JUAN
text: A flag.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You know what it means when a flag
dialog: is hung upside down?
dialog: (he doesn't)
dialog: It's an international distress signal.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: No shit. It means we are in a whole
dialog: lot of trouble, so come save our
dialog: ass, cause we haven't got a prayer
dialog: in hell of saving ourselves.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: It says a lot.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yes, it does. So, you know how to
dialog: do it now?
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Good.
text: Juan looks up at the flag flying. Hank walks to his truck.
scene_heading: EXT. DEERFIELD HOME -- DUSK
text: Joan watches from the kitchen window. Out in the drive,
text: Hank lies under his dump truck, smacking the rod with a
text: mallet. He curses it and rises.
scene_heading: INT. DEERFIELD HOME -- DUSK
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (passing the kitchen)
dialog: Anyone call?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: No.
text: Joan watches him tread upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S ATTIC OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: The phone rings in Hank's ear, until:
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (0.S.)
dialog: Fort Rudd, how may I direct your
dialog: call?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: First Sgt. Arnold Bickman, Criminal
dialog: Investigations Division.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (0.S.)
dialog: ...I'm sorry, sir, I have no one by
dialog: that name on base.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Thank you.
text: Hank hangs up, swivels in his chair and sees Joan standing
text: in the open doorway.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You going to tell me?
scene_heading: INT. DEERFIELD HOME - HANK & JOAN'S BEDROOM
text: Hank opens his top drawer, removes three neatly folded pairs
text: of underwear, socks, three white undershirts. He tucks them
text: into a small zip bag and opens his second drawer, removes
text: three starched white cotton shirts and a shoe shine kit.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I want to go with you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: If he's holed up somewhere
dialog: celebrating, the last thing he needs
text: is his mother walking in on him.
dialog: I'll call you when I get there
dialog: tomorrow night.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: It's a two day drive.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: For some people.
text: He kisses her on the forehead, puts his laptop under his arm
text: and exits.
scene_heading: INT. DEERFIELD HOME - MIKE'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Copies of Soldier of Fortune share the shelves with sports
text: memorabilia and snapshots of Mike and his buddies in Bosnia
text: (circa 2001) and Iraq (2003). Hank fingers an autographed
text: football, puts it back and slips a photo of Mike in his dress
text: uniform out of the frame. He pockets it and heads out,
text: flicking off the light.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE -- NIGHT
text: The pickup speeds along, passing a car or two.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. HANK'S PICKUP - TWO LANE BLACKTOP -- NIGHT
text: Hank does what he does best, drive. An oncoming big rig
text: blinds him with its high beams. Hank squints.
scene_heading: FADE TO WHITE
speaker_heading: MIKE (V.0.)
dialog: Dad? Dad?
scene_heading: YOUNG BOY'S VOICE
dialog: Dad!
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S PICKUP - REST STOP -- EARLY MORNING
text: Hank WAKES with a start. He hears tapping. Hank looks to
text: his driver's side window and is surprised to see...
scene_heading: A FIERCE-LOOKING CHOLO
text: standing at the open window, chewing gum. Tattoos, scarred
dialog: face, someone you would cross the street to avoid. Hank
text: tries not to react.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CHOLO
dialog: How ya doin'?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Good. You?
speaker_heading: CHOLO
dialog: Very good. You got a light?
text: Hank pushes in his cigarette lighter and they wait. Tense.
text: It pops out. Hank hands it to him and the Cholo lights his
dialog: smoke.
speaker_heading: CHOLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks.
text: And he walks back to his junker car, where Hank sees evidence
text: of someone else sleeping in the back seat. A small American
text: flag flies clipped to the window.
text: Several other vehicles are parked in this REST STOP off the
text: interstate, mostly trucks and campers.
text: Out in the patch of grass a young boy kicks a soccer ball
text: around while his parents sleep.
scene_heading: YOUNG BOY'S VOICE
dialog: Dad?.... Dad!
text: Hank smiles to himself, grabs his bag and opens his door.
scene_heading: INT. REST STOP RESTROOM - MORNING
text: Hank puts away his shaving kit, buttons the cuffs of his

scene_heading: EXT. FT. RUDD MILITARY BASE - ENTRANCE -- AFTERNOON
text: The pickup drifts up to the guard kiosk and Hank hands the

scene_heading: INT. FT. RUDD MILITARY BASE - OFFICE CORRIDOR

scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
dialog: Sgt. Deerfield?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Hank. Thanks for seeing me, I know
dialog: you're busy.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
dialog: (walking him in)
dialog: You should have let me know you were
dialog: coming; I would have cleared some
dialog: time. Bet the base has changed a
dialog: lot since your day.
scene_heading: INT. FT. RUDD - SGT. CARNELLI'S SHARED OFFICE -- LATER
text: Hank and Sgt. Carnelli sit. A corporal brings in coffee.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: What about his buddies?
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
dialog: We asked, of course.
dialog: (re: coffee)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (to Hank)
text: A lot of men are just coming back
dialog: today from a 72. I don't want you
dialog: to think I'm not concerned, but where
dialog: these boys have been, it's a miracle
dialog: more of them don't blow outta here
dialog: for a few days. For the last eighteen
dialog: months they couldn't drink, couldn't
text: even flirt with a woman. They touch
dialog: down, the first thing they do is
dialog: find a bar and a girl. I expect
dialog: your son will come stumbling in
text: looking for a shot of penicillin.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: ...You mind if I had a look at his
dialog: quarters?
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS CORRIDORS -- AFTERNOON
text: Men come and go in their Green BDUs. Sgt. Carnelli and Hank
text: weave through the men. Carnelli spots CORPORAL STEVE PENNING,
dialog: 22, calls to him:
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
text: Penning.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: Yes, Sergeant.
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
text: This is Specialist Deerfield's father.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: Steve Penning, good to meet you,
dialog: sir. Have you heard from Mike?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: No.
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
dialog: Mr. Deerfield wants to take a look
text: at his son's quarters.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: (to Hank)
dialog: Certainly, sir. Shortcut is through
dialog: here.
dialog: (leads them)
dialog: Mike and I go back to Bosnia, he
dialog: sure told me enough stories about
dialog: you. He hasn't called or anything?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You find that surprising?
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: You'd know better than me, sir, but
dialog: I recall Mike showing up for roll
text: call with a collarbone sticking
text: through his skin.
text: Penning spots two soldiers ahead watching a foosball game.
dialog: Calls tot

speaker_heading: PENNING (CONT'D)
dialog: Long, Ortiez. This is Doc's dad.
scene_heading: ALIST ENNIS LONG, 22 and PRIVATE ROBERT ORTIEZ,
dialog: Mexican American, same age.
speaker_heading: LONG
dialog: Honor to meet you, sir.
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ
dialog: Good to meet you.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Doc?
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: A nickname we gave him, made no sense.
dialog: (points to door ahead)
dialog: That's Mike's room there.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Carnelli goes ahead and knocks, then reaches for his ring of
text: keys. Hank hangs back with Ortiez and Long.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You boys have any idea where Mike
dialog: could be?
speaker_heading: LONG
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ
dialog: Must be one hell of a woman.
text: Something makes Hank take a beat before responding. For
dialog: some reason he doesn't like Ortiez.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LONG
dialog: Good meeting you, sir.
text: Suddenly Mike's door opens from inside, revealing SPECIALIST
text: GORDON BONNER, bare-chested. He just stares at them.
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: Sergeant?
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: This is Specialist Deerfield's dad,
dialog: we've come to look at his bunk.
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: (stepping back)
dialog: Then you don't need a key. Somebody
dialog: took a boot to it yesterday.
text: Carnelli checks the cracked door frame as Hank steps in.
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
dialog: You report this to the CQ?
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: Yes, Sergeant. Sorry, thought you
dialog: were somebody trying to steal stuff.
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS - MIKE'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Bonner retreats into the adjoining bathroom. Through it,
text: Hank sees a bedroom beyond.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Your room?
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (re: bed near the wall)
dialog: That's Mike's bunk there.
text: Bonner goes back to his room to finish dressing. Hank looks
text: around Mike's small room: two single beds, small desks,
text: bedside tables and lamps.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (re: second bed)
dialog: Who is this?
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
dialog: We lost a man.
text: Hank nods. He opens the closet; all his son's clothes are
text: still there. He searches the top shelf, then pulls a duffel
text: bag out of the bottom; checks the contents.
speaker_heading: SGT. CARNELLI (CONT'D)
dialog: That's your duffel, right?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
dialog: Tried to convince him to use the one
dialog: he was issued, it was like talking
text: to a wall.
text: Hank walks to the small bureau, opens it, sees the very neatly
text: folded, neatly pressed t-shirts and shirts squared away in
text: the drawer. Hank suddenly stops and looks around the room,
text: just now noticing something by its absence.
speaker_heading: HANK
text: There are no photographs.
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Mike's always taking pictures,
dialog: emailing them to me. I don't see
dialog: any photographs. Or a camera.
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLT
dialog: You saw the door.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SGT. CARNELLI (CONT'D)
dialog: Property theft is a real problem. I
dialog: guess that hasn't changed since your
dialog: stint.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: No.
text: Hank steps to Mike's bedside table. He fingers open the
text: Bible lying on it. The inside leaf is stamped: Courtesy of
text: Chaplain Services. He pulls open the drawer and notices a
text: battered cell phone hiding amongst the junk.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: Bible)
dialog: Mind if I take this? His mother
dialog: gave it to him. I left mine at home.
text: As he picks up the Bible with his right hand he smoothly
text: palms the cell phone with his left and slips it into his
text: pocket. He looks to the bathroom door and notices Bonner,
text: looking away, tucking in his shirt. Did he see him palm the
dialog: cell phone?
scene_heading: SGT. CARNELLI
dialog: I'd like to, but I can't let you
dialog: remove anything.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I understand.
text: He puts the Bible back on the bedside table.
scene_heading: INT. BARRACKS ENTRANCE -- DAY
text: Hank signs out and walks off toward the exit.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: Sergeant Deerfield?
text: Hank turns to see Penning trotting up behind him.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Hank.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: Yes, sir. Before he left for Iraq,
dialog: Mike was seeing a girl: her name was
dialog: Jennifer Lopez. We teased him about
dialog: dating J Lo.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You know where I could find her?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: Sorry. I'll ask around.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Thank you.
text: Hank turns and walks off.
scene_heading: INT. CELLULAR PHONE STORE -- AFTERNOON
text: A young SALESPERSON replaces the battery in Mike's phone.
speaker_heading: SALESPERSON
dialog: This thing's been around some intense
dialog: heat.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's been in Iraq.
speaker_heading: SALESPERSON
dialog: That could do it.
dialog: (tries power, nothing)
dialog: Sorry, it's dead. But I can give
dialog: you a new phone with more features
dialog: with a two year contract.
scene_heading: EXT. CELL PHONE STORE PARKING LOT -- EARLY EVENING
text: Hank stands next to the open door of a panel van. Inside
text: GABRIEL, a cell phone technician sits at a bench with a
text: computer and equipment. He plugs the phone in under:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I need any phone numbers in memory.
text: Garbled information comes up on the computer screen.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: This is seriously fried.
dialog: (searching)
dialog: Address book. You got numbers for
dialog: Barracks, Burgers, Chicken, Jenn--
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Give me that one.
text: The technician points to the screen. Hank points to the
text: guy's cell phone.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: May I?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Sure.
text: Hank picks it up and dials the number as the technician
text: continues to work. Hank hears:
speaker_heading: RECORDED MESSAGE
dialog: The number you have dialed is no
dialog: longer --
text: Hank snaps it closed.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Mom, Pizza, TD's and Ted.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: TD's?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Local joint. Coulda been more but
dialog: that's all that's left.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Thanks. How much?
text: Hank digs for his wallet. The technician studies the screen.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You want the media?
dialog: This catches Hank off guard - what media?
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SCREEN - TIME CUT
text: The phone tech clicks on an icon and a VIDEO CLIP PLAYS.
text: There's electronic drop out and only sporadic sound, but
text: it's Mike's squad -- BONNER, PENNING, LONG, ORTIEZ, driving
text: on the road to Baghdad, singing a marching song we only hear
dialog: bits of.
text: The camera pans to the windshield, where we see the convoy
text: of assault vehicles. Smoldering carcasses and Iraqi tanks,
text: trucks and civilian automobiles line their route.
text: Mike pushes the camera out the window and gets a shot of the
text: large FLAG mounted on a pole fixed to the High Back Humvee,
text: flapping in the wind. He pulls the camera back in and the
text: image freezes on a shot of Mike.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: That your son?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: That's Mike.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Sure as hell glad they didn't get
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: That feeling is probably mutual.
dialog: Any more?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: (taps more keys)
dialog: Yeah, but they're real corrupted.
dialog: If you want 'em I got a program at
dialog: home that might be able to pull them
dialog: off, but it's real slow. Charge you
dialog: a hundred flat?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (digs out wallet)
dialog: Can you email them to me?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (handing him $100)
dialog: Where's TD's?
scene_heading: INT. TD'S -- CONTINUOUS
text: Naked women twirl on poles to unbearably loud RAP MUSIC.
text: The place is jammed with off duty soldiers. The BOUNCER
text: points to the bar. Hank squeezes through the crowd and finds

dialog: heard:
speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: JODIE

speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: You tie it up, you give it away, you
dialog: might even shoot it, but you sure as
dialog: hell don't pick it up by the throat,
text: wrestle it into the bathroom and
dialog: drown it in the tub! You don't think
dialog: there's something seriously wrong
dialog: with that?!
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Perhaps he thought it was more humane.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: More humane?! It's a Doberman! And
text: he's drowning it right in front of
dialog: our son, and it's biting him, and
dialog: I'm screaming for him to stop. Does
dialog: all this sound humane to you?!
text: Hank tries another passing detective, same result.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Did your husband threaten you or
dialog: your child with violence?
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: He'd never hurt us, he just needs
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Then you should ask the VA about
dialog: counseling.
speaker_heading: ANGIE
dialog: You don't think I've been there? He

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: That kind of morning, huh?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: (glancing at form)
dialog: You have to take this to the Military

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah, but I'm trying to keep my son

dialog: you're busy, but all I need you to

speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Retired cop or just watch a lot of
dialog: TV?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Military Police, retired.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Then you know that the Army has
dialog: jurisdiction over its personnel.
dialog: I'm sorry, I hope you find your son.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Listen, I don't know what you think
dialog: your job is. If it is anything like
dialog: mine, it was to roll up the drunks,
dialog: twiddle my thumbs and not ask too
dialog: many questions. But my son just
dialog: spent eighteen months bringing

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Which do you think it is, Hank: I'm

speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
dialog: Working backwards: the carbon patterns
text: show that the body was dismembered
text: before it was burnt. It appears a
dialog: knife or similar tool was used; but
text: the blade was dull, many of the joints
text: are shattered rather than severed.
dialog: The burn patterns tell us the
text: dismembered parts were stacked and
text: doused with an accelerant in an
dialog: attempt to incinerate the body;
dialog: ridiculous because you need an oven
dialog: to approach an effective temperature.
dialog: Which means most of the tissue would
dialog: have been left intact, so the damage
text: is largely a result of scavengers
text: stripping the bones.
dialog: (we see the teeth marks)
dialog: Cause of death is going to take more
dialog: time to determine, but there's
text: evidence of multiple stab wounds.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: How many wounds?
speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
dialog: With most of the flesh missing we
dialog: can only count the blows that made
text: impact with a bone.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: How many of those are there?
text: Only now does the medical examiner begin to understand the
text: obvious, that he's telling all this to the corpse's father.
text: He checks his pad, looks up.
speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
dialog: ...Forty-two.
speaker_heading: HANK

dialog: One knife or several?
speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER

speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: You gonna turn these over to the

scene_heading: POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER

scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: If it's all right, I'd like to give
dialog: you a call tomorrow, before you go
dialog: home, I have a few questions that--
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Ask them now.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: ...I can check with records and answer
dialog: some of these things -- I take it
dialog: your son didn't own a green car?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Mike doesn't own a car.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
text: A motorist reported seeing a green
text: sedan parked on the shoulder near
dialog: the field Saturday night. One theory
dialog: is that this was a car-jacking or
dialog: robbery gone wrong. There's been a
dialog: real uptick in gang activity lately.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'd like to see where he died.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: I'm sorry, it's still an active crime

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: What else you want to ask?
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: A lot of the deaths we've seen like
dialog: this have been drug related.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (walks off)
dialog: Are you asking if Mike was a drug
dialog: dealer or just an addict?
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: I don't want to be asking anything.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You know the Army does regular drug
dialog: tests.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: Not while they're in Iraq.
dialog: (produces a small hash
dialog: pipe in an plastic bag)
dialog: We found this under your son's
dialog: mattress. It won't go on my report,
dialog: but why I ask...last month we arrested
text: three soldiers trying to smuggle
dialog: heroin in from Kuwait. They'd
dialog: arranged to sell it to a local Mexican
dialog: gang. I understand Mike spoke some
dialog: Spanish.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You think my son could have been a
dialog: drug mule because he spoke Spanish?
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: No, because somebody cut off his

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION -- EVENING

speaker_heading: SANDERS

dialog: on military property.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: But you know where it is.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: There is nothing to see.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Then there shouldn't be a problem

text: Sanders sees how hard Hank is trying to hide his pain.
scene_heading: EXT. MESA LUNA ROAD - KILLING FIELD -- NIGHT
text: Sanders leans against her blue Ford Taurus in the sickly
text: yellow wash of the streetlight, her car parked the wrong way
text: on the gravel shoulder, high beams failing to illuminate
text: much of the field where Hank stands. Finally:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You people sure as hell know how to
dialog: trample a crime scene, I'll give you
dialog: that.
text: Hank squats where the body was burned and pivots, shining
text: his flashlight at the tumbleweeds and scrub brush.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Suppose you figured it was a good
dialog: idea to have everyone you ever met
dialog: park on this shoulder.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If your crime scene boys had known
dialog: where to dig, they'd have found traces
dialog: of blood in the gravel here. It's
dialog: where he was killed.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, you don't see blood, but you
dialog: know it's there.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yes, miss. Just like I see how his
text: body was dragged from here to there.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: That's remarkable. That ground is
dialog: rock hard, but you see drag marks.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You go to all the trouble of burning
dialog: a body, you don't think you'd try
dialog: and cover your path?
text: Hank hands her the flashlight and walks off across the road
text: toward the parking lot and the gun store on the far side.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
text: Going to use the restroom.
text: Curious now, Sanders takes her flashlight and steps into the
text: field. Hank struts across the road. Without looking back:
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You might find it easier to drive
dialog: around the field. You couldn't do
dialog: more damage.
text: She throws a look, then shines her flashlight on the ground,
text: finally spots a broken base of a tumbleweed -- lifts it and
text: places it aside. She takes another step toward the fire
text: site and finds another broken weed and puts it aside.
scene_heading: EXT. D & G GUNS - PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS
text: Hank crosses the parking lot and opens the front door.
scene_heading: EXT. MESA LUNA ROAD - FIELD -- NIGHT
text: Sanders lifts a last tumbleweed out of the way and stops at
text: the fire site. She turns and sees the clear, trampled path
dialog: of where the body was dragged.
scene_heading: INT. D & G GUNS -- NIGHT
text: Hank waits. JO ANNE steps up to the counter. She's dressed
text: like she's looking for a man to take her away from here.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Hi. I suppose the MPs have been in
dialog: asking you questions about what
dialog: happened over in that field.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JO ANNE
dialog: Yes, they have. Terrible thing.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'm checking it out for the family.
dialog: You mind if I ask you if you saw
dialog: anything going on over there?
text: Her jealous husband, RANDY, approaches to check out Hank.
speaker_heading: JO ANNE
dialog: Wished we had, we would've liked to
dialog: help. We didn't even know what it
dialog: was when we smelled it, did we, honey?
text: Hank doesn't show that his heart just stopped beating.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: ...How's that?
speaker_heading: JO ANNE
dialog: That Sunday morning, when we drove
dialog: into the parking lot. We just thought
dialog: somebody'd been barbecuing.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (agreeing)
text: Smelled like burned meat.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Thanks. Mind if I use your restroom?
speaker_heading: JO ANNE
dialog: Through that door. Show him, honey.
scene_heading: INT. D & G GUNS - MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Hank squats on the floor beside the toilet and lets the horror
text: of his son's body being burned overwhelm him.
scene_heading: EXT. MESA LUNA ROAD -- NIGHT
text: Returning to the shoulder, Sanders turns and spots a dog in
text: the field, chewing on something. Her stomach tells her what
text: that something is. She curses silently as she throws a look
text: across the road; sees Hank coming from the parking lot.
text: Sanders picks up a hand full of pebbles and tosses them toward
text: the dog, who balks but quickly returns. She throws a look
text: in Hank's direction, gauges that he hasn't noticed and tosses
text: another handful in the dog's direction. It barely even looks
text: up this time. Hank arrives and steps to the Taurus.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You can tell your MP friends they
dialog: should be looking for a blue car,
dialog: not a green one.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: HANK
text: Because a blue car under a yellow
dialog: light looks green, doesn't it?
text: Hank gets in and Sanders looks at her car -- which looks
text: green in this light. Almost angry at herself for not seeing
text: the obvious, she opens her door and gets in.
text: She does a U-TURN and DRIVES OFF. HANK watches the dog in
dialog: the field.
scene_heading: EXT. IMPERIAL MOTEL -- NIGHT
text: Sanders drops him off.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: It was the least I could do.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'd say that's accurate.
text: And he walks away, leaving her wondering why she even tried
dialog: to be nice.
scene_heading: EXT. SANDERS HOME -- NIGHT
text: A modest bungalow on the outskirts of town. Sanders enters

speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Thanks, Lee Anne.
scene_heading: INT. DEERFIELD HOME - KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Having just been told the news, Joan opens her mouth to cry
text: out...but no sound escapes. Her knees won't hold her weight,
text: so she slides down the wall to land gracelessly on the floor.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: HANK
text: There is nothing left.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: What the hell does that mean?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Joan, for once in your life can you
dialog: just take my word for something?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: -- For once? For once?! I seem to
dialog: remember me being the one saying
dialog: "no" and you saying "it will be good
dialog: for his character!" Who won that
dialog: argument, Hank?!
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Mike was the one wanted to join, I
dialog: sure as hell didn't encourage it!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Like he could ever have felt like a

dialog: Hank. You could have left me one.
text: And with that she finally weeps, the sound so piercing and
text: full of pain that it goes right through Hank.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Joan?... Joan, please.
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Joan, I can't listen to you cry.
speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: MIKE (0.S.)
dialog: -- really weird, Dad.
text: Their clothing is melted into them, as if heat from the bodies
text: did the damage. Mike zooms in on a hand with a book, flips

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE BUREAU -- AFTERNOON
text: A uniformed cop guides a young handcuffed redneck punk named

speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Stay there.

speaker_heading: SANDERS

scene_heading: LT. BURKE
dialog: You see the way you can draw

dialog: you got promoted from traffic to the
dialog: detective squad, am I right?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: ...I'm sorry??
scene_heading: LT. BURKE
dialog: Oh, don't be. If Wayne and Hodge
dialog: could have fucked their way into the
dialog: squad, they would have, too.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HODGE
dialog: Wayne would have. One of us needs
dialog: to know what they're doing.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Ah. See, that's what concerns me.
dialog: Having fucked my way into this job,
dialog: I may not be qualified to piece
dialog: together this complex of a crime. I
dialog: mean, take the murder site; I would
dialog: have never come to the conclusion
dialog: that that soldier had been killed on
dialog: Army property. I would have been
text: fooled by the signs of struggle on
dialog: the shoulder of the road. And that

speaker_heading: CHIEF BUCHWALD
dialog: No, it's good work. We needed another

dialog: the need to show them up, that it?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: CHIEF BUCHWALD

speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: No, sir. But let's not pretend we

dialog: for wanting this case.
speaker_heading: CHIEF BUCHWALD
dialog: When did you discover you had these

speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, you don't believe the Army's
dialog: primary concern will be how this

speaker_heading: CHIEF BUCHWALD
dialog: And you see this as a career move,
dialog: is that it?
speaker_heading: SANDERS

text: Hank walks her away down the long corridor.
scene_heading: EXT. BRADFORD AIRPORT - WHITE ZONE -- NIGHT
text: The pickup pulls to the curb. Other cars drop off passengers.
text: Hank looks to her, unsure of what to say. There isn't
text: anything. Joan leans over, gives him a cursory kiss, opens
text: the door and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Silhouetted against the window, Hank watches the fragmented
text: images of war -- searching their frames for meaning, finding
dialog: none.
scene_heading: EXT. COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT
text: Hank walks from the motel to the coffee shop next door, as
text: he has done every day since he's been here. This time he's
text: surprised to find the door locked. The JANITOR inside speaks
text: through the glass.
speaker_heading: JANITOR
text: Closed. It's Sunday.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: ...It is?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is there someplace close to get
dialog: something simple?
text: The janitor nods toward the dive across the street. The
dialog: Checker Box.
speaker_heading: JANITOR
dialog: Checker Box.
scene_heading: INT. THE CHECKER BOX -- NIGHT
text: The bar is almost empty, it's way too early for crowds.
text: Hank enters, walks to the bar, gets the male BARTENDER's
text: attention. He looks like a former military type.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What can I do you for?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Can I get a hamburger?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Just cold sandwiches. Chicken or

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Then chicken.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: (calling into back)
dialog: Evie, chicken sandwich.
dialog: (to Hank)
dialog: Anything else?
text: Hank slips a photo of Mike out of his jacket.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You happen to see this soldier in
dialog: here last weekend?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Sorry. Something to drink?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Beer, I guess. Whatever you're
dialog: pushing.
text: The bartender pulls a glass of beer, gives it to Hank and
text: moves off. Hank drinks like a man who hasn't allowed himself
text: many pleasures. Before he expects it, EVIE, the waitress,
text: shows up behind the bar with his sandwich on a plate. It's
text: pre-made, still in its plastic wrapper. Evie is mid-forties,
text: maybe fifty, and topless. Hank freezes.
speaker_heading: EVIE
dialog: You want mustard or ketchup?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: No, thanks, ma'am.
speaker_heading: EVIE
text: Woman stands topless in front of
dialog: you, "ma'am" could be taken as an
dialog: insult.
dialog: (sees photo)
dialog: This your son?
speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: EVIE
dialog: (smiles at his discomfort)
dialog: Handsome boy.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'm asking if anyone saw him; it
dialog: would have been last Saturday.
speaker_heading: EVIE

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Thanks.

scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. SANDERS HOME - DAVID'S ROOM -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: ANGLE FROM HALL
text: She steps out, leaving David's door open and the hall light

scene_heading: INT. SANDERS HOME - DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Sanders slips the gruesome photos of Mike's dismembered body
text: parts from the file and studies them with a magnifying glass,
text: the brightly colored kind that kids use to inspect insects.
scene_heading: EXT. IMPERIAL MOTEL -- MORNING
text: Sanders knocks on Hank's door; no response. She steps back,
text: looks at his truck and wonders where he's gone. She steps
text: out into the parking lot, looks across the street.
scene_heading: INT. COIN OP LAUNDROMAT -- MORNING
text: Through the plate glass window we see Sanders step up. Hank
text: sits at the back in his white T-shirt, waiting for his clothes
text: to dry. He sees her approaching and opens the still-spinning
text: dryer, pulls out a cotton shirt and puts it on.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Morning. I was wondering if I could

dialog: son.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I thought it wasn't your case.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Well, it sort of fell back to me.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Isn't that our good fortune.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: I was wondering if you knew if your
dialog: son had any enemies.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You mean other than the thousands of
dialog: Iraqi and foreign fighters who were
text: trying to kill him up until a couple
dialog: weeks ago?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (beat)
text: That shirt looks like it's still

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's dry enough.
text: It obviously isn't, but Hank keeps buttoning and tucking.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Anything bothering him, that you
dialog: know about?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: No. You following up the gang
dialog: connection?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Do you have a reason to think your

speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: (shows him)
dialog: Capital One faxed me a summary of
dialog: his recent credit card charges. The
dialog: day after he returned he bought some
dialog: tube socks --
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I told him a dozen times those are
dialog: the worst socks you can buy. No
dialog: heel, they wear right through.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: ...And then that Saturday he bought
dialog: some chicken.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Does it say what time?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: No. No more charges. We're assuming
dialog: he was killed sometime Saturday night
dialog: or Sunday morning. We still haven't
dialog: found his wallet, but if it was stolen
dialog: we'd see a lot more charges on it.
dialog: Stereos, computers, what have you.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You been to the chicken place yet?
text: Sanders looks at him, knows what he is asking, knows she
dialog: shouldn't do this.
scene_heading: INT. CHICKEN SHACK -- DAY
text: A local chain, full of enlisted men. Sanders waits at the

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: How can I help you?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: (showing her badge)
dialog: We're making inquiries about a soldier
dialog: who was in here a week ago.

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: It's the last four digits...
dialog: (she hands him receipt)
dialog: 1:03 AM Sunday morning. We bill
dialog: that as Saturday. Anything else?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Can you tell us what he bought?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Not without the actual receipt.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Okay. Thanks.
text: Sanders takes the receipt and turns to leave. Hank stays
text: there, staring at the menu display.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Your four piece dinner is $6.79.
dialog: That what most people order?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: That or the three piece.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (re: credit card printout)
dialog: So, with tax, $21.77 would be around
text: three dinners. Three people.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Four if it's the three piece. Or
dialog: one really hungry soldier.
text: Hank nods and exits. Sanders follows, secretly kicking
dialog: herself for not asking such an obvious question.
scene_heading: EXT. CHICKEN SHACK -- DAY
text: On leaving, Hank spies two Mexican gangbangers hanging out
text: at the adjacent liquor store, drinking beer with a couple of
text: young, white toughs. Hank watches them as he strides toward

speaker_heading: SANDERS

speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: So, where did he go from here?
speaker_heading: SANDERS

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah, maybe.

scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL AVE - INTERSECTION -- DAY
text: Sanders' vehicle approaches an intersection and suddenly
text: brakes hard as a CONVERTIBLE runs the opposing red light and
text: swerves onto the avenue, five men with buzzed hair and bottles

text: their light turns red.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You haven't got a flashing red light?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Got a nice one in the glove
dialog: compartment.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You're not going to do anything about
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: SANDERS

scene_heading: EXT. IMPERIAL MOTEL -- AFTERNOON
text: Sanders' Ford pulls up, Hank steps out without saying a word.

scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- AFTERNOON

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR -- AFTERNOON
text: Sanders heads back toward her office. Slows as she sees

scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: There you are. I just dropped
dialog: something off for you.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: You did.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: We took statements from the men in
dialog: Mike's squad, thought you'd want
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: (thrown but covering)
dialog: That's great, thanks; I was just about
dialog: to call you to arrange interviews.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: Saved you the trouble.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: How so?
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: The sworn statements? On your desk?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: You didn't think I'd want to interview
dialog: them myself?
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: Listen, I was just trying to give
dialog: you a leg up.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Thanks, but I sort of like to do my

scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER

scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Is that what I'm doing? Listen,
dialog: read the statements; if you still
dialog: want to question them, I will be
dialog: glad to take the request to my CO.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Perhaps you misunderstood me, Smiley;
dialog: this isn't a request. I want a list
dialog: of the men in his unit--
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: On your desk.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: -- and I want to interview them this
dialog: afternoon.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: You're gonna have to take that up
dialog: with my Co.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: My chief already spoke with him--
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: Well, this one is a bit of a
dialog: jurisdictional mess.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: There is no mess. The murder was
dialog: committed in our jurisdiction.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: That's where it gets murky.
dialog: (moving off)
dialog: You read those, gimme a ring, glad
dialog: to put in the request.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - LT. BURKE'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON
scene_heading: LT. BURKE

speaker_heading: SANDERS

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: LT. BURKE
dialog: Then they're cooperating, I don't

speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Lieutenant, I have a right to

scene_heading: LT. BURKE
dialog: Has the Army said you can't?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: They said they'd consider my request.
scene_heading: LT. BURKE
dialog: And that was a full ten minutes ago?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: --And I would like to talk to these
dialog: men before they've been coached so --
scene_heading: LT. BURKE
dialog: -- "coached"??
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: -- "debriefed" so often that any
dialog: inconsistencies in their stories
dialog: will have long disappeared. Being a
dialog: former military man, I'm sure you've
dialog: seen that happen. Perhaps when you
dialog: served with Lt. Kirklander.
scene_heading: LT. BURKE
dialog: Tell you what, skip upstairs and cry
dialog: to your boyfriend, because I'm just
text: not in the mood to give a shit.
text: Burke dismisses her; she exits past smirking Hodge and Wayne.
scene_heading: EXT. MESA LUNA ROAD - CRIME SCENE -- LATE DAY

text: tape fluttering in the wind. She starts to feel guilty for
dialog: what she said to Hank.
scene_heading: EXT. IMPERIAL MOTEL -- LATE DAY

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: So, you know everything about this

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: So, if you were out here, in the
text: pitch black, not a moon in the sky
dialog: or a light in the house, you could
dialog: find your way home.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (points)
dialog: It's right over there!
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Okay.

scene_heading: IN HER KITCHEN - SANDERS

text: boiling over.
scene_heading: OUT IN THE FIELD - HANK
text: Turns David around, blindfolded. Stops him.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: So, where is it now?
text: David points in the opposite direction. Hank lifts the

speaker_heading: SANDERS
text: Smiles at her son's stubbornness.
text: BACK WITH HANK AND DAVID
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Close your eyes, feel the wind on
dialog: your face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: There is no wind.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You'd be surprised. And you want to
dialog: know a secret? This time of night,
dialog: when it's calm like this, the wind
dialog: is almost always moving the same
dialog: way. Close your eyes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can you feel it?
text: David touches his cheek.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Open your eyes. Look at your house.

speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Find your way home.

scene_heading: FROM HER WINDOW

scene_heading: INT. SANDERS HOME - DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Okay, men, dig in.

text: silently. David watches him closely, closes his eyes and
text: mimics him. Sanders watches. Hank opens his eyes and reaches
dialog: for the platter to serve.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: May I?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Please.
scene_heading: INT. SANDERS HOME - KITCHEN -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: SANDERS

dialog: No. Out. Go get ready for bed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can do it.
speaker_heading: SANDERS

scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

text: in bed, Hank sits on the edge, silently reading The Chronicles
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ...You're supposed to read it to me.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I can't understand a word of it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do you know any stories?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'm not much of a storyteller.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Then read the book.
text: Hank considers, thinks of something.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You know where your name comes from?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My mother.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Before that. You're named after
dialog: King David. Your mother never tell
dialog: you that?
dialog: (David shakes his head)
dialog: Yeah, that figures.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
text: listening from the kitchen reacts, but chooses not to
dialog: interrupt.
scene_heading: IN DAVID'S BEDROOM
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: There were two armies assembled, the
dialog: Israelites and the Philistines; they
dialog: were both on hills, with the Valley
dialog: of Elah between them. That's a place
dialog: in Palestine. You know where that
dialog: is?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: David shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: It doesn't matter. Anyway, the
dialog: Philistines had a champion, a giant
dialog: named Goliath.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: There's a robot named Goliath.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: This wasn't him. Anyway, every day
text: for 40 days, Goliath strode out into
dialog: the field and challenged somebody
text: from the other side to fight him,
dialog: and nobody would. The strongest and
dialog: bravest warriors that the king had
dialog: were all too scared.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why didn't they just shoot him?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: They didn't have guns.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They had arrows, but there are rules
dialog: to combat. You don't shoot somebody
dialog: who is challenging you to fight with
dialog: a sword. So, this kid, not much
dialog: older than you, he comes delivering
dialog: bread. And he says to the king,
dialog: "I'll fight Goliath."
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: True story. So, the king dressed
text: David in his own armor, but it was
dialog: much too big and heavy. So, David
text: takes it off. He looks around and
dialog: finds five smooth stones, about yay
text: big. He steps into the field, with
text: his slingshot in his hand. And
text: Goliath comes running, yelling, this
text: horrible scream. And David lets fly
text: the stone. And hits him in the
text: forehead. Cracks his skull. And
text: Goliath falls down, dead.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: So, he shot him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: With a rock, that's not the same
dialog: thing. You know how he was able to
dialog: beat him?
text: David shakes his head, enthralled.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: First thing David had to fight was
dialog: his own fear. He beat that, he beat
dialog: Goliath. Cause when Goliath charged,
dialog: David just planted his feet, took
dialog: aim, and waited. You know how much
dialog: nerve that took? A few more steps
dialog: and Goliath would have crushed him.
dialog: And then he threw the rock. That's
dialog: how you fight monsters. Lure 'em
dialog: close to you, look 'em in the eye
dialog: and smack 'em down.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You fight a lot of monsters?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: »..You win?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: If I didn't, I would have been
dialog: crushed, right?
text: David sees the logic. Nods.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay then. You go to sleep.
text: He turns off the light and leaves, closing the door behind
text: him, casting the room into darkness.
text: IN THE KITCHEN AND HALL
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: He likes to sleep with that door
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: He'll be okay.

dialog: open it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: When he doesn't, she goes back into the kitchen and picks up
text: the coffee pot. As she's passing through the hall again,
text: she hears his small voice.
speaker_heading: DAVID (0.S.)
dialog: Door.
text: She steps to it, eases it open.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Not that much.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Okay.
text: That's something. She eases it almost closed and heads off
dialog: to
scene_heading: THE DINING ROOM
text: where she pours them both a cup, deciding not to mention the
text: bedroom door.
speaker_heading: SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: You know that story isn't true.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Of course it's true. It's even in
dialog: the Koran.
text: She decides not to argue.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I read the men's statements?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: No. And there's nothing in them
dialog: that'll help. The last time any of
dialog: the men saw Mike was Saturday
text: afternoon, before he left base.
text: Hank takes this in, looks out the window, trying to put this
text: all together. After a moment:
speaker_heading: SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a good father. You don't
dialog: have to prove you loved him, I'm

speaker_heading: JOAN

text: Pictures of cocaine run through his head.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Does it look like it's been opened

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: How would I know? No. Why shouldn't

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Just don't. Wait.

text: at the copy place: proud warriors striking poses, squad mates
text: goofing around. Iraqis -- groups of blurred civilians, shot
text: from the moving High Back Humvee; detainees, lined up facing
text: a wall, hog-tied on the ground, squatting with hands on heads.
text: Always in groups, the camera never singling out one person.
text: That is, except for the photo of the body on the side of the
text: road. Hank stares at it, trying to figure out why it bothers
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: EVIE (0.S.)
dialog: Hi.
text: Hank looks up to see Evie, the topless waitress. He stares,
text: obviously not recognizing her dressed like a regular person.
speaker_heading: EVIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Evie, from the bar. "Ma'am"?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Oh, hello, sorry.
text: He slips the photo of the body under the stack of others.
text: An awkward moment.
speaker_heading: EVIE
dialog: I saw the picture of your son in the
dialog: newspaper. When you came in, I
dialog: thought he was just missing. I'm
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Thank you.
text: She notices the top 8x10 photo, the posing warriors.
speaker_heading: EVIE
dialog: That him?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: EVIE
dialog: May I?
text: She swivels the photo to look at it.
speaker_heading: EVIE (CONT'D)
text: Nice eyes. Takes after his father.
text: She looks at the next, and the next. Hank becomes concerned
text: that she'll see the photos of the bodies. Evie stops ona
text: photo of Mike and Steve Penning, arms around shoulders.
speaker_heading: EVIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Him, I remember.
text: Hank looks. Then to her.
speaker_heading: EVIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I work at another club on weekends.
dialog: He was there. Would have been
dialog: Saturday night.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You remember who he was with?
speaker_heading: EVIE
dialog: You only remember the ones that tip.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: What's the name of the club?
scene_heading: INT. PUSSY'S -- EVENING
text: Hank places a photo of Mike and Penning atop something that
dialog: reads "Pussy's."
speaker_heading: BOUNCER (0.S.)
dialog: They were here.
text: WIDEN to see the club, too early to be busy. The security
text: monitor beside them flashes from one view to another.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Both of them? Saturday night.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Them and their buddies. We had to
dialog: throw them out.
dialog: (nods to photo)
dialog: That one was harassing one of the
dialog: dancers. Real asshole.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (pointing out Penning)
dialog: This guy?
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: The other one. You get a lot of
dialog: assholes in here but he was going
dialog: for the prize, yelling all kinds of
text: obscenities at the dancers.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I think you have the wrong man.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: You want me to ID a guy, and then
dialog: you tell me I'm wrong. You two
dialog: related?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: What time did they leave?
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Christ if I remember, but they weren't
text: happy about it. Two of them started
dialog: going at each other in the parking
dialog: lot. Thought I'd have to break it
dialog: up myself.
text: Hank turns for the door.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE COUNTER - AN HOUR LATER
text: Sanders slaps six photos down on the counter beside the
text: monitors. Four of the photos we recognize. The bouncer
text: jabs the photos of Penning, Long and Bonner.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SANDERS, THE BOUNCER AND NUGENT
text: She scoops them up, puts them in the paper bag that passes
text: as her briefcase and slaps a form and a pen onto the bar.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Detective Nugent will wait while you
dialog: write out your statement.
text: Nugent thinks about grumbling. Sanders calls back as she
text: storms out past Hank, who waits by the door.
speaker_heading: SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: I want the pen back, Nugent.
scene_heading: EXT. PUSSY'S -- NIGHT
text: Hank steps out after her and she turns on him.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: This is not Saigon, this is not 1967,
dialog: you do not question witnesses.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I figured somebody should.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: It must be frustrating for you, being
dialog: such a damn good investigator
text: surrounded by incompetent fools.
dialog: Remind me, what is it you do back in
dialog: Munroe?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I haul gravel.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Now that's a shame. Think of how
dialog: many crimes would have been solved
dialog: over the last 30 years if you'd been
dialog: on the job.
dialog: (points to front door)
text: When this goes to trial, the defense
dialog: is going to say you poisoned the
dialog: well!
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's not going to trial.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: --What?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It wasn't them.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: I'm sorry??
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I don't know why they lied in their
dialog: statements about not being with him,
dialog: but they didn't do it.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: They were fighting in the parking
dialog: lot--!
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: --That was blowing off steam. You
dialog: haven't been to war, so you wouldn't
dialog: understand this. But you don't fight
text: beside a man and then do something
dialog: like that to him.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: That's quite the world you live in.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (walking off)
dialog: Ask them why they lied. There will
dialog: be a reason.
text: Sanders watches him get into his pickup, stunned by his
dialog: arrogance.
scene_heading: EXT. FT. RUDD MILITARY BASE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT
text: Sanders fumes as she waits. Traffic goes in and out. The
text: guard hands her back her ID and waves her on.
scene_heading: INT. USACID OFFICE - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Sanders and Kirklander sit across from Penning.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, you were there.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, why did you lie?
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: It's complicated.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Why don't you just tell me what
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: It was no big deal. We'd been
dialog: drinking, and Mike had been acting
dialog: really weird. Getting really angry.
dialog: And he's not saying why. But he
dialog: starts insulting this stripper, I
dialog: mean, it was dumb, he made some crack,
text: she cracked back and he starts talking
dialog: trash. So they toss us out. And
dialog: we're getting in the car and Bonner
dialog: is all pissed and saying Mike can
text: walk. Mike grabs him, they start
dialog: going at each other. But it was
dialog: just the kind of stuff they did all
dialog: the time -- the whole macho warrior
dialog: crap. Nobody got hurt. We got in
dialog: the car, drove around for a while,
text: then went to the chicken shack, across
dialog: from the base. Mike bought, for
dialog: getting us kicked out.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: What time was that?
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: I don't know, around one. Then we
dialog: came back here.
text: Upon hearing this Kirklander stands and leaves the room.
text: This doesn't go unnoticed.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: All of you?
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: .No, just the three of us.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Why did you leave him there?
scene_heading: INT. USACID OFFICES - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Specialist Long has replaced Penning.
speaker_heading: LONG
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: That was the question.
text: Kirklander enters with a thin manilla envelope, sits and
text: puts it on the table in front of him face down. Long eyes
text: him and considers before answering.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: He stares
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: LONG
dialog: We were wasted, we had enough, but
dialog: Mike wanted to find some meth.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: He wanted to buy drugs.
speaker_heading: LONG
dialog: Yeah. Like he needed to be more
dialog: fucked up, pardon my language, ma'am.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: And you think that's what happened
text: to him. He went looking for drugs
dialog: and ran into the wrong people?
speaker_heading: LONG
dialog: Who knows? Mike always had "secrets."
dialog: Over there he was always sneaking
dialog: off somewhere, by himself. He didn't
dialog: really get along well with people.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, you were thrown out of the strip
dialog: club at eleven, you show up at the
dialog: chicken shack at one. What did you
dialog: do for two hours?
speaker_heading: LONG
text: Drove around. Looking for a party
dialog: or women, like they were going to
text: hold up a sign.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: You stop anywhere?
speaker_heading: LONG
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: ...Now you want me to guess.
speaker_heading: LONG
dialog: We found a hooker on 10 Mile Road
dialog: and she blew all four of us.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Do you remember her name?
text: at her, the question being ridiculous.
speaker_heading: LONG
dialog: No, ma'am.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, why didn't you say this when you
dialog: were questioned?
scene_heading: INT. USACID OFFICE - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: We realize she addressed that question to Gordon Bonner.
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: Because we didn't think Mike would
dialog: want his parents to know.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: ...You didn't want his father to
dialog: know he got a blow job?
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: And was buying drugs. I wouldn't
dialog: want somebody telling my parents.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, what was the fight about?
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: Mike was in some dark mood, I don't
dialog: know why. Then he started saying
dialog: nasty things to that stripper.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: Just stuff I'm not going to repeat.
dialog: The woman's a stripper, not something
dialog: on your shoe.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
text: Out in the parking lot, Penning said
dialog: Mike came at you swinging.
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: Might have, don't recall. We thought
dialog: finding him some sort of sex would
text: calm him down. But not Mike.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: You didn't like him much, did you?
dialog: You got in a lot of fights.
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: There were people I liked better.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, what was different about that
dialog: night? Was it just that you hada
dialog: knife?
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: I want to kill someone, I don't need
dialog: a knife, ma'am.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, you never killed anyone with a
dialog: knife.
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: Don't believe I said that.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: But I guess in Iraq things were
dialog: different. Someone makes you mad,
dialog: you could deal with it.
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: You lost me.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: It's a different world. You have
dialog: power.
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: You've obviously never been in the
dialog: Army.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: You have weapons, authority; you put
text: men face down in the dirt, step on
text: their backs, kick in their doors.
dialog: Someone comes running at you, you
dialog: kill him. You have to, right? Guy
dialog: could have a bomb or a gun, you kill
dialog: him first.
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: You make the call.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Woman walks toward you screaming,
dialog: won't stop, does she have a bomb?
dialog: Not a lot of time to think. You
dialog: react or die. Ever have to stab
dialog: someone?
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: If I did it wouldn't be your business.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Kirklander switches off the tape recorder.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: You're there one day, here the next;
dialog: somebody comes charging at me, I'd
text: be reaching for a weapon.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: (to Sanders)
dialog: Did you notice the interview was
dialog: over?
dialog: (to Bonner)
dialog: Let's go.
text: Sanders continues as she walks them out into:
scene_heading: THE ADJOINING HALL
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Yeah, I'm finished. I'm just glad
dialog: none of that stuff bothered you.
dialog: Because, I tell you, I saw my father
dialog: come home with things he did that he
dialog: couldn't live with. It pretty much
dialog: destroyed him.
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: Your father? What was he in, Panama?
dialog: You have no idea what we did over
dialog: there. And we did it for you.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: For me??
speaker_heading: BONNER
dialog: So, if I were you, I'd just say
dialog: "thanks," leave it at that and kiss
dialog: my ass.
text: And he walks off. Kirklander stays with Sanders.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: You happy, or do you want to convene
dialog: a war crimes tribunal?
text: Sanders turns on her heels and storms back into --
scene_heading: THE INTERVIEW ROOM
text: -- and gathers up her stuff.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: I want the clothes they were wearing
dialog: and I want to take full body
text: photographs for cuts and bruises.
text: She heads for the door.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: You can have the clothes. But you
dialog: may want to glance at this.
text: He hands her the manilla envelope. The way he said it makes
text: her look at it with curiosity. She opens it and slides an
text: 8x10 photo out -- black and white, a frame from a surveillance
text: camera posted at the guard gate: Bonner's car, Bonner driving,
text: Penning and Long the passengers. The time and date are
text: stamped large, among other information. 1:26 AM. She
dialog: understands the significance.
speaker_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER (CONT'D)
dialog: Still want them?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: (refuses to admit defeat)
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: He clicks on the computer and plays a video clip again --
text: sporadic images, mostly black.
text: A prisoner on the floor of a humvee. A SCREAM. Mike is
text: saying something we can't make out. Another SCREAM.
speaker_heading: MIKE (V.O.)
dialog: Leave him alone!
text: It ends frozen on Ortiez, who stares hatefully at the camera.
text: The phone rings, startling him.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (0.S.)

dialog: Lopez with something we can't see.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Here's your guest.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'll be two secs.
text: The nurse exits. Hank realizes the technician is fitting
text: Jennifer with a prosthetic arm.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it just needs to be tighter.
text: The technician nods and moves off with the arm.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: (nods toward the chair)
dialog: Please, sit.
text: Jennifer throws her leg back onto the bed and Hank sees that
text: her other leg is missing. Hank tries not to look.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: You left a message on my Uncle Jay's
dialog: voicemail. I guess you found out
dialog: how many Lopezes there are in the
dialog: phone book.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I read what happened to Mike. I'm
dialog: really sorry. He was a great guy.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Did you serve together?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No. I'ma reservist. And I don't

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: We had no doors on our vehicle, driver

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Mike and I met two years ago,

dialog: --at a bar. I'd had a little too
dialog: much to drink and Mike saw this guy
text: pawing me and just laid him out.
dialog: Bam. He took me home in a cab, didn't
dialog: even try to kiss me good night.
dialog: (smiles again)
dialog: After that, we went out all the time,
dialog: until he left. He was very sweet.
dialog: (beat )
dialog: He called me when he got back.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: (now interested)
dialog: He did.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yeah, he came to see me that Friday.
text: She lets that hang.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Did he say anything? You know,

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No. I don't think so.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: How did he seem?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: ...I'm not sure what I should say.
dialog: I mean, he was a great guy. And I
dialog: want to remember him...I want you to

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: He wasn't.... There was something in
dialog: him I'd never seen before. I don't

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: When he saw me. He laughed. I mean,
dialog: at first I thought, "great" -- I
dialog: mean, I am so sick of the sympathetic
dialog: looks, laughing was sort of
dialog: refreshing. So I laughed, too.
dialog: Then he said...not to worry; the
dialog: parts he was interested in still
dialog: worked. I didn't know what to say.
text: Hank takes this in. Jennifer tries to undo the damage.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sure it was just...I don't know
dialog: what it was.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He talked about you a lot, you know.
dialog: Before he left. He was really worried
dialog: he'd let you down. What you thought
dialog: of him was everything.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry I said those things.
text: Hank is overwhelmed. He wants to reach out and touch her
dialog: hand, but
text: She nods.
dialog: can't.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I want to apologize on his behalf.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You don't have to, I'm sure he didn't

speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: You want to come in?
text: He stands and follows her to her desk, where they sit.
speaker_heading: SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: You were right, they couldn't have

speaker_heading: SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Bonner, Penning and Long arrived

speaker_heading: HANK

speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NUNEZ
dialog: (grabbing his jacket)
dialog: Finding Bobby was never the problem.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DOOR
text: Hank waits as they head out with shotguns, pulling on vests.
text: Sanders pauses briefly.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Go to your motel. I will call you.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Nunez's unmarked car pulls out of the parking lot, Sanders
text: and Nugent right behind them. As they disappear down the
text: street, Hank's pickup pulls out and follows.
scene_heading: EXT. BARRIO - ORTIEZ'S GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE -- DAY
text: Nugent assumes backup position at his vehicle. Sanders takes
text: the side door. She notes Ortiez's blue Chevy in the covered
text: carpark. Nunez and his partner creep up the front steps.
scene_heading: WITH HANK - A BLOCK AWAY
text: His pickup cruises up in time to see:
scene_heading: NUNEZ AND HIS PARTNER
text: -- bang on the front door.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NUNEZ
dialog: Police Department, open the door!
text: They take the door down with a ram. Nunez rushes past Cholos
text: smoking dope, as his partner holds them at gunpoint.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: -- is the first to see...
text: ORTIEZ ON THE ROOF
text: -- bursting out from a trap door and running along the ridge
text: toward the attached garage.
dialog: 90.
text: AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE
text: Sanders hears feet clattering on the roof, spots Ortiez just
text: as he jumps off into the alley and disappears. Sanders bolts
text: for the back yard, clambering over junk and climbing the
dialog: back fence.
text: Nunez slams open the back door and gives chase.
scene_heading: FROM A BLOCK AWAY
text: Hank watches the game unfold, sees Nugent run back to his
dialog: vehicle, wills him to do the smart thing:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Take the street, take the street --
text: Nugent wheels into the alley.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Christ.
text: Hank drops the truck into gear and rolls down the street,
text: turning the corner and paralleling the alley.
text: IN THE BACK ALLEY
dialog: We can see why catching Ortiez isn't easy -- this kid runs
text: and climbs fences like a goat on steroids. He bounds a fence
text: and jumps into a backyard.
text: Sanders scrambles after him, but stays in the alley.
text: Nugent swerves through the twisting dirt alley, swerving
text: right before breaking hard at a dead end.
text: Nunez comes around the corner. Sanders screams that he's
text: "in the yards." Nunez jumps the fence and pursues as...
text: Ortiez leaps from one yard to the next.
text: Nunez tries a fence and misses, slamming back onto his ass.
text: Sanders keeps running...but she can see Ortiez is getting
dialog: away.
text: OUT ON THE STREET
text: Hank cruises, scanning the houses and side yards until he
text: glimpses Ortiez. Hank sees where Ortiez is going to cut
text: into the open. He stomps on the accelerator. Ortiez bursts
text: out onto the street. Hank catches up to him and swings open
text: his driver's door, slamming Ortiez to the pavement.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Hank grabs his metal trucker's flashlight and leaps out before
text: Ortiez can scramble to his feet. Ortiez's knife appears out
text: of nowhere, but Hank catches him with a kick to the gut that
text: puts him back down. Still reeling, Ortiez lunges, but Hank
text: catches him square in the jaw with the flashlight. Ortiez
text: hits the pavement and Hank pummels him viciously.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Fucking wetbacks; it's always knives,
dialog: isn't it? You enjoy cutting him up?
dialog: Did you?
text: Sanders arrives and tries to pull him off. Reacting
text: instinctively, Hank elbows her in the face, breaking her
text: nose and sending her sprawling. He doesn't even glance back,
text: he just keeps releasing his fury on Ortiez's bloody face.
text: Nunez arrives a heartbeat later, aiming his weapon.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NUNEZ
dialog: Let him go! Stop!
text: But he doesn't. Nugent runs up and pulls Hank off, rolling
text: him to the ground; Hank struggles with Nugent, trying to get
text: back at Ortiez.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NUGENT
dialog: Hey! HEY! What the hell are you
dialog: doing?!
text: Hank comes to his senses and stops struggling. Sanders
text: struggles to her feet, holding her spurting nose.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - HOLDING AREA -- EVENING
text: Hank opens his eyes. He sits cuffed to a wooden bench. He
text: looks down at his hands, cut and swollen.
text: He glances through the open door and sees Ortiez being
text: released from a holding cell, into the custody of two burly
text: MPs. They head for the exit, meaning they're going to have
text: to pass Hank. Hank tugs on the chain that binds him as they
dialog: near.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: What was it? You wanted him to carry
dialog: drugs for you and he wouldn't do it?
dialog: You afraid he was going to tell on
dialog: you? That it, Chico?
text: That did it. Ortiez jerks to a stop, face to face with Hank
text: leans in close to his ear and whispers:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ
dialog: Wouldn't it be funny if the devil
dialog: looked just like you?
text: The MPs get him moving again. Hank calls after him:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Come back here, you wetback prick,
dialog: I'll show you what the devil looks
dialog: like.
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ
dialog: (laughs him off)
dialog: Fuck you, man.
text: Ortiez disappears around the corner with his guards. He
text: turns and sees Sanders approaching, her nose swollen, a band-
text: aid over the cut.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I see you cracked him wide open.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Hold out your hands.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I didn't mean to hit you.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: That what passes for an apology in
dialog: your world?
text: (as she uncuffs him)
dialog: He isn't pressing charges. You're
dialog: damn lucky I feel pity for you or
dialog: I'd be doing it myself.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Keep it.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Is anyone going to question him?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: I questioned him, they questioned
dialog: him, we searched his house, there is
dialog: no evidence that he had anything to
dialog: do with it!
text: Hank doesn't know what to say. Sanders turns on her heel
text: and walks off.
dialog: 93.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Hank lies awake in his soiled white T-shirt, staring at the
text: ceiling. The sheets are half off the bed. The room is
text: unrecognizably messy.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
text: The alarm clock reads 10:18 AM. Hank wakes to a knock on
text: the door. He opens it to Sanders.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Something's happened.
scene_heading: INT. FT. RUDD - ARMY M.E.'S LAB -- DAY
text: Sanders and Lt. Kirklander stand over the gurney.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: We found him hanging in his room.
text: A morgue technician pulls back the sheet to reveal Gordon
text: Bonner's horribly discolored face, his neck scarred and raw.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Did he leave a note?
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: No.
scene_heading: INT. USACID OFFICE -- DAY
text: Kirklander opens a small manilla envelope and tips the
text: contents into Hank's hand. It's a watch, circa 1950.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: My father gave it to me when I went
dialog: to Vietnam. I gave it to Mike.
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
text: It was in Bonner's pants pocket.
text: The thought strikes Hank as amazing.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: ...He was carrying it? He didn't
dialog: leave a note -- he just put it in
dialog: his pocket and then hung himself?
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: I'm afraid it's as close as we're
text: going to get to a confession.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Confession.
text: Hank exits, disgusted.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Bonner's car; what color is it?
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: Blue. Why?
scene_heading: EXT. FT. RUDD - PARKING LOT -- DAY
text: Hank follows Sanders to her vehicle.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You don't kill someone for no reason.
dialog: That watch isn't proof of anything.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: You think your son would have given
dialog: it to him?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It could have been planted on his
dialog: body!
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, why did he kill himself, Hank?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I don't know! But tell me how he
dialog: killed Mike! He had an alibi, he
dialog: was back at the base! When did he
dialog: do it? Why did he do it?
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: ...I don't know, Hank. I'm sorry.
text: She climbs into her Taurus, exhausted. Hank shakes his head
text: and walks off to his pickup. Sanders' cell phone rings.
text: She answers it.
speaker_heading: SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes?
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE BUREAU -- DAY
text: Nugent on the other end of the phone. He doesn't want to
dialog: have this conversation.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE NUGENT
dialog: ...Remember the woman with the dead
dialog: dog?
scene_heading: EXT. MOBILE HOME PARK -- NIGHT
text: Sanders comes around the corner and steps out onto the street
text: of identical mobile homes, lit by flashers from police
text: vehicles. Hastily dressed neighbors stand across the street
text: from a home that lies at the eye of the storm.
text: As she walks toward it, she notices a muscular man in his
text: late 20s, close cropped hair, sitting cuffed in the back
text: seat of a squad car. Several officers stand by it, smoking
text: and talking. Everyone shows up for a murder.
text: Sanders lifts the crime scene tape and walks through the
text: open front door, which boasts an Army service sticker.
scene_heading: INT. MOBILE HOME -- NIGHT
text: Sanders weaves through the milling officers. Detective wayne
text: catches her eye -- it's the first sympathetic look he's ever
dialog: given her.
text: She keeps moving, finding Hodge in the hallway outside the
text: bathroom. There's water all over the bathroom floor. Small
text: feet poke over the edge of the bathtub. He speaks kindly.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HODGE
dialog: We drained it.
text: Sanders steps forward until she can see Angie, the woman who
dialog: complained about her husband drowning her dog, lying in the
text: tub, her clothes clinging to her.
text: Sanders squats beside the tub for fear of falling. She asks
text: the question she doesn't want answered.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Where's the boy?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE HODGE
dialog: He wasn't home, thank God. He's at
dialog: his grandparents’.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: That's good.
text: She touches Angie's hand.
speaker_heading: SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: That's good.
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Hank sits on the bare, stained mattress, phone to his ear.
scene_heading: INT. DEERFIELD HOME -- NIGHT
text: Joan sits in the kitchen, staring out the back door. She
text: makes no move to answer the ringing phone.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE BUREAU -- DAY
text: The room is busy and yet remarkably quiet. Sanders sits at
text: her desk, going through her phone log and losing herself in
text: the minutiae of her job. The civilian worker from the front
text: desk drops off a Fed Ex envelope and offers Sanders a
text: sympathetic smile. Sanders opens it and goes through the
dialog: contents with little interest. It's a credit card statement
text: with hard receipts attached -- various purchases Mike made,
text: including the tube socks and the chicken. She flips through
text: them and then tosses them in her out basket.
scene_heading: INT. FT. RUDD - MORGUE OFFICES -- DAY
text: Hank sits slumped in a chair in the corridor, waiting. An
text: OFFICER steps out of one of the cubicles. Hank stands as he
text: approaches, hands him a clipboard to sign.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: The remains will be shipped this
dialog: afternoon, if you'd please just check
text: the address of the funeral home.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's correct.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: And, I'm afraid we have to keep the
dialog: skull. Until the case is officially
dialog: closed. I'm sorry.
dialog: (hands him carbon receipt)
dialog: If I can be of any other help, please
dialog: let me know.
text: Hank watches the young officer walk off.
scene_heading: EXT. FT. RUDD - PARKING LOT -- DAY
text: Hank closes the driver door and cranks the key. The battery
text: is dead. He sees he's left his headlights on, stabs the
text: switch back in place and gets out.
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: INT. FT. RUDD - BARRACKS -- DAY
text: Hank walks along the corridor, no one around. He stops at
text: an open door, looks in. It's Penning. Hank thinks about
text: walking away, but then Penning turns.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: ». Sir?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: ...You got jumper cables?
scene_heading: EXT. FT. RUDD - PARKING LOT
text: Penning opens the hood of his brown Nissan and attaches the
text: leads. Hank hits the ignition and the truck comes to life.
text: Penning walks to the driver's window.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: I wanted to say how sorry I am, what
dialog: happened to Mike. And I need to
dialog: apologize, for lying, about not seeing
dialog: him that night. I just thought that,
dialog: if I were Mike, I wouldn't want my
dialog: parents to know.
text: Hank nods.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You have a cigarette?
text: Penning pops out one and Hank accepts it. They light up.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think Bonner killed him?
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: No. I don't know. I don't understand
dialog: any of this.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: What would he have against my boy?
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: Nothing. I'm sorry.
dialog: (a moment )
dialog: Mike tell you much about Bosnia?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Some.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: We seemed to always pull sentry duty,
dialog: freezing our asses off. He used to
dialog: try and convince me of the craziest
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Try to get you to wear pantyhose?
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: Did he tell you??
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I told him. Cuts the cold like
dialog: nothing else.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: So he wasn't lying??
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You just gotta make sure you aren't
dialog: shot while wearing a pair, or you'll
dialog: never live it down.
text: Penning has to laugh. Hank smiles for the first time in
text: many days. Then his thoughts drift back to his dead son.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: It's fucked up, isn't it?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah, it is.
text: And then a thought strikes Hank, and he looks at Penning.
text: It is clear from his expression that Hank now knows something
dialog: we don't; something terrible.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Hank downloads a video and plays it. Black punctuated by the
text: occasional flash of an image; the audio comes in and out.
text: Someone is whimpering, pleading in Arabic. We see a flash
text: of his face: a bound IRAQI PRISONER with a bag over his head,
text: lying on the floor of the moving High Back Humvee between
text: the feet of the men in Mike's squad. Mike is just off screen,
text: sitting over him, apparently holding the camera. Screen

speaker_heading: MIKE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MIKE (0.S.) (CONT'D)

dialog: You fucking pervert
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Fuck you, man.
text: The CAMERA SWINGS BACK to the man on the floor as Mike jabs
text: his boot into the prisoner's wound. The prisoner SCREAMS,
text: the pain searing. Mike keeps probing, torturing the prisoner
text: out of sport. The camera tilting up to Mike's face for the
text: first time as he turns off the camera and the image freezes.
text: HANK sits there, horrified.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE BUREAU -- NIGHT
text: Sanders drops a file in her out basket, puts her jacket on
text: to leave, sits and picks up her purse from under her desk.
text: But she can't seem to stand. She looks around the room,
text: then at her brimming out basket. Something makes her
text: reconsider a document in there. She slides out the credit
text: card statement and flips through it, wondering what bothered
dialog: her about it.
text: She stops at the chicken receipt and then looks back at the
dialog: tube sock and other receipts -- the signature for the chicken
dialog: is different than the others.
text: She moves quickly to the file cabinet and jerks it open,
dialog: finds the original statements that the men made about their
text: whereabouts. She checks the signatures, Bonner, Long and
text: Penning.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Hank packs his bag.
dialog: 100.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE BUREAU -- NIGHT
text: Sanders slaps Penning's statement down on the desk, under a
text: bright lamp, beside the receipt. She compares the signatures.
text: Key letters in both are exactly the same.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Banging. Hank opens the door. Sanders has to stop herself
text: from commenting on how awful he looks.
text: She hands him a file folder with a credit card receipt clipped
text: to the cover.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Tell me that's your son's signature
text: on his credit card receipt.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's not.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: We just assumed Mike was there.
dialog: It's Penning's signature. Three
text: meals: Penning, Long and Bonner.
scene_heading: INT. SANDERS' VEHICLE - MOVING -- NIGHT
text: They drive toward the base in silence. Sanders glances at
text: Hank, tries to read him; can't.
scene_heading: EXT. FT. RUDD MILITARY BASE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT
text: Her Taurus idles in a parking space near the guard gate.
text: Sanders waits impatiently beside the car, staring at the
text: guards in the kiosk, one reading a comic book.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Son of a bitch.
text: She looks to Hank, stone-faced in the passenger seat. She
text: would have expected rage, not fatalism. She gets it.
speaker_heading: SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: You knew. How?
text: Hank doesn't answer. The phone in the guard booth rings,

speaker_heading: GUARD

speaker_heading: SANDERS

scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER

scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER

speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: How much?.... HOW MUCH TIME?!
scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: ...AS much as I could get.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Well, luckily that means nothing to

scene_heading: LT. KIRKLANDER
dialog: I know you're feeling burned....
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: What would you guess? On a weekend,
dialog: what, seven or eight thousand
dialog: soldiers? I tell you what I can do.
dialog: I can sit in my car outside of any
dialog: of your entrances, pull over every
text: vehicle returning to base and arrest
dialog: every soldier whose blood alcohol is
dialog: one one thousandths over the legal
dialog: limit. How many men do you think

speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: We leave the strip club and we think
dialog: that Mike and Bonner have cooled
dialog: down. I mean they could be like
dialog: that, laughing one minute and fighting

dialog: and Mike's all pissy. And Bonner
text: starts needling him. Saying shit.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: I don't know, like what a good driver
dialog: Mike is, stuff that makes no sense.
text: Bonner has enough and pulls over and
text: they go at each other again. Long
text: is yelling for them to cut it out so
dialog: we can go home and Mike starts cursing
text: him, too, and I look down and I'm
text: stabbing him.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: You are.
text: She throws a look to Kirklander, who can't hold her glance.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: Yeah. I mean, he always had to push
dialog: things too far, you know? What's
dialog: making me madder is that he is just

speaker_heading: SANDERS

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: PENNING

text: They're yelling. And then Mike falls
text: down. And he's dead. And Long says,
dialog: "Christ, what do we do now?" It was
text: Bonner's idea to chop him up. He
dialog: used to work in a butcher shop; knew
dialog: how to work the knife around the
dialog: joints; made it easier.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We were going to bury the parts, but
dialog: it was getting late. And we hadn't

speaker_heading: SANDERS

speaker_heading: PENNING

speaker_heading: PENNING (CONT'D)
dialog: You ask me why, I don't know. I

text: Penning starts to be overcome by his emotions. To Hank:
speaker_heading: PENNING (CONT'D)
dialog: I am truly sorry, sir. I'm sorry
dialog: for your loss.
text: Hank fights the urge to leap across the table and strangle
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I saw a video Mike shot, him in the
text: back of a Humvee. It looked like he
dialog: was torturing a prisoner.
speaker_heading: PENNING
dialog: (has to smile)
dialog: We arrested some hajji, he's wounded.

dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: «Hi.
speaker_heading: CHIEF BUCHWALD
dialog: I wanted to drop these by. I was
dialog: going to knock, but I didn't want to
dialog: spook your sitter.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: And you thought a stranger sitting
dialog: out here staring at the house would
dialog: make her feel more secure.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CHIEF BUCHWALD
dialog: They're for a Lobos game. That's
dialog: football. Good game, Lobos against
dialog: the Utah Utes.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: No kidding. The Utes.
speaker_heading: CHIEF BUCHWALD
dialog: Thought it was worth a shot, before
dialog: you turn the boy against the game
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CHIEF BUCHWALD
dialog: You did good police work.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Figured that's what they were for.
text: Sanders exits into the house. Buchwald backs out.
scene_heading: EXT. IMPERIAL MOTEL -- EARLY MORNING
text: The parking lot lies quiet, one car departing.
scene_heading: INT. HANK'S MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
text: Hank packs up the laptop and Mike's photos.
scene_heading: INT. FT. RUDD - BARRACKS -- DAY
text: An NCO waits as Hank packs Mike's few articles into his
text: duffel. He hands it off to the NCO as a NEW RECRUIT, in his
text: Class A's, steps in, carrying his duffel and paperwork.
speaker_heading: NEW RECRUIT
dialog: Excuse me, sir.
text: Hank takes this in, then looks down the corridor.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Which is Private Ortiez's room?
scene_heading: INT. ORTIEZ'S ROOM
text: Hank appears at the open door, sees Ortiez inside packing up
text: his belongings. Ortiez notices Hank standing there.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You have a minute?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Ortiez isn't quite sure how to answer.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to apologize to you.
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ
dialog: Damn straight you do.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ
dialog: You got some serious issues, man.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Yeah. That's true.
text: A moment. Hank holds up a fresh fifth of whisky.
scene_heading: EXT. FT. RUDD - BARRACKS -- DAY
text: Ortiez drinks from the bottle and passes it to Hank. He and
text: Hank sit on the low wall under the overhang at the barracks,
text: watching a sergeant drill his recruits in the field.
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ
dialog: I got an honorable discharge, if you
dialog: can believe it.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's the Army, I'd believe anything.
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ
dialog: (watching troops)
dialog: I hated it over there. Sleep in
dialog: fucking tents, no toilets, no showers,
dialog: no toilet paper, gotta use your hand --
dialog: and you never know where the bullet
dialog: is coming from. I couldn't wait to
dialog: get out. And after two weeks here,
dialog: all I want to do is go back, cause
dialog: somehow that makes sense. How fucked
dialog: is that?
text: They sit there a moment. Hank hands Ortiez one of Mike's
text: photos: the body on the side of the road.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: You know what this is?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Mike took it and emailed it to me.
dialog: Why would he do that?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't know what anybody told you.
dialog: (Hank waits him out)
dialog: There were standing orders. You're
dialog: driving in convoy, someone or
dialog: something gets in front of your
dialog: vehicle, you do not stop. You stop,
text: shitheads pop up with RPGs and kill
dialog: you all dead.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: First week in Iraq, we're driving
dialog: down range, six of us in back, you
dialog: can't see squat back there. Doc
text: hits something. We hear it thump
text: around underneath. He stops, gets
text: out; drives on. Not a word. Later,
dialog: some guys said we hit a kid, I don't
dialog: believe it. You ask me, it was a
dialog: dog. We killed a dog.
text: And Hank can see how hard Ortiez wants to believe that.
speaker_heading: ORTIEZ (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what that is. No fucking
dialog: idea.
scene_heading: EXT. FT. RUDD - PARKING LOT -- DAY
text: Hank opens his driver's door and throws the duffel in before
text: him, slides in and starts the engine before he closes the
text: truck door. He stares out through the windshield and sees:
scene_heading: BAGHDAD STREET - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF A MOVING HUMVEE
text: A kid runs into the middle of the street, between vehicles,
text: picks up a soccer ball and turns to look toward the camera.
text: INSIDE THE MOVING HIGH BACK HUMVEE
text: Mike panics, Bonner urges him to speed up, Mike steps on the
dialog: accelerator.
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
text: The Humvee hits the boy with the ball. The only sound we
text: hear is the thud, and then the body tumbling under the
text: vehicle's undercarriage.
text: INSIDE THE HIGH BACK HUMVEE
text: Mike drives on a moment, betraying no emotion. Then brakes.
dialog: 109.
text: ANGLE ON THE STREET
text: Mike steps out and walks back toward the small body that
text: lies on the side of the road. Bonner gets out and yells at
text: him. Mike stops. He sees people running toward the body,
text: from a nearby house.
text: Ortiez parts the tarp and peers out from the back.
text: Mike lifts his phone, composes the shot, and takes a picture
dialog: of the body.
text: Mike turns and walks back. Bonner hesitates, obviously
text: unnerved by the sight of the body. They return to the
text: vehicle, step in and tugs closed the door.
scene_heading: BACK WITH HANK
text: The images are too much to bear. He pulls his door closed.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP -- DAY
text: Sanders sits with Hank.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: So, my son has been driving me crazy
dialog: ever since you came over. He wants
text: a slingshot.
text: Hank smiles.
speaker_heading: SANDERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess it could be worse, could be a
dialog: bee-bee gun.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It was Mike's favorite story, too.
text: He tries not to show her the pain that is threatening to
text: overwhelm him.
scene_heading: EXT. COFFEE SHOP -- DAY
text: Sanders walks Hank to his pickup. He gets in, looks up at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Thank you.
text: She nods. Hank drives off without looking back.
dialog: 110.
scene_heading: EXT. DEERFIELD HOME -- DUSK
text: Hank carries his overnight case toward the dark house.
scene_heading: INT. DEERFIELD HOME - KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: The room is dark. Hank turns on the light above the stove.
text: Mike's package sits on the counter, opened. He peels back
text: the paper to reveal a tightly folded flag. An envelope sits
text: atop addressed to "Dad." Hank finds a photo inside, Mike
text: and his squad mates stretching the flag, jerry-rigged to a
text: pole over their humvee, smiling broadly. Hank turns the
text: photo over. It is inscribed: "For Dad, love Mike." Hank
text: turns and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. DEERFIELD HOME - HANK & JOAN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Hank sits on the edge of the bed, the phone to his ear.
text: Joan sleeps on her side.
speaker_heading: MIKE (0.S.)
dialog: Something happened, Dad. Something
dialog: bad.
text: And then we hear Mike start to cry. Hank is mortified.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Oh for Christ's sake.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is there anyone there with you?
speaker_heading: MIKE (0.S.)
dialog: No, I'm alone.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: That's good.
scene_heading: IN BAGHDAD -- BARRACKS
text: Mike on the payphone, trying to keep it together.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Okay, Dad, I gotta go.
speaker_heading: HANK (0.S.)
dialog: You be safe, son. Stay safe.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You too, Dad.
text: Mike hangs up and walks away to join his unit outside.
dialog: 141.
text: BACK IN THE BEDROOM
text: Hank hangs up. We cut to the doorway and see
speaker_heading: HANK
text: standing there, fully dressed. And now he weeps, knowing he
dialog: let his son down when the boy needed him.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: the dark room and the neatly made bed.
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: steps up behind him, rubs his shoulders.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: He asked for my help. I didn't even
dialog: listen.
text: He wants to say more, but doesn't know what to say.
scene_heading: INT. DEERFIELD HOME - MIKE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Hank picks up an empty frame and slips Mike's photograph
text: back into it -- him in his dress uniform, now considerably
text: worn. He replaces it on the shelf.
scene_heading: INT. SANDERS HOME - DAVID'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Sanders sits on the bed with her son, telling him a story.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: Every day Goliath would walk out
text: into the valley and challenge someone,
dialog: anyone, to fight him. No one would.
dialog: Until David showed up and said, "I'll
dialog: fight him." So, the king dressed
text: David in his own armor, but it was
text: too big and heavy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why would the king let him fight a
dialog: giant? He was just a boy.
speaker_heading: SANDERS
dialog: I don't know, sweetie.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You think he was scared?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 112.

speaker_heading: SANDERS

scene_heading: DEERFIELD HOME - KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING
text: picks up the opened parcel from the counter.
scene_heading: HIGH SCHOOL - FLAG POLE -- MORNING
text: attaches the flag. Juan watches Hank raise it.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Just like that?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Just like that.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: (re: flag)
dialog: Looks really old.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's been well used.
text: duct tapes the line firmly to the pole.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: And I shouldn't take it down at night?
text: hands Juan all the bills in his wallet.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: No, you leave it just like that.
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: That's much easier.
text: nods and walks off, and now we see the tattered battle
text: flapping in the wind atop the pole. Upside down.
dialog: The End
