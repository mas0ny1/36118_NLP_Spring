text: A STAGE MANAGER knocks and calls out in a Brooklyn accent:
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER (0O.S.)
dialog: Five minutes...five minutes
text: Ink stained fingers fumble with silver CUFF LINKS. A pair of

dialog: adjusted.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (V.O.)
text: Of the crowds that pour in and out
dialog: the whole day; of the people that
dialog: line the streets when I go out...
text: In the mirror, the writer (CHARLES DICKENS) looking like an
text: English rock star in his prime (silk blouse, tight trousers,
text: velvet jacket), fusses with the locks on his forehead, then
text: steps back and regards himself critically.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (V.O.)
dialog: ....of the balls, dinners,
dialog: speeches, parties, assemblies
dialog: without end. There never was a king

text: He breaks into a wide grin.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: ‘Ello, Charlie.

scene_heading: INT. PARK THEATER. CORRIDOR & STAGE- CONTINUOUS 5
text: Dickens moves along the corridor. The sounds of the crowd
text: stomping their feet and clapping their hands gets louder as
text: he nears the stage.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (V.O.)
dialog: They come from the lakes, the
dialog: rivers, the back-woods, the log-

speaker_heading: PRESENTER
dialog: .+..The great magician of our time,

speaker_heading: PRESENTER (0.S.)
dialog: ... the one and only, the
dialog: inimitable, the great and
dialog: marvellous Boz! Ladies and
dialog: gentlemen- Mr. Charles Dickens!
text: The stagehands raise the curtain. Dickens takes a deep breath
text: and steps into the light. At the sight of him, the audience
text: rises to its feet as one.
text: Behind him “TABLEAUX VIVANTS” appear, depicting sights and
text: scenes of London, Beef Eaters roll out canons, characters
text: from Oliver Twist come to life, urchins dance along to the

text: SCREAMING “BOZ, BOZ, BOZ"”.
text: Dickens attempts to speak to the crowd.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Dear friends, you have welcomed me
dialog: to your country with such open arms
dialog: that I fear that I-
text: But his speech is cut off by a deafening volley as the

text: Geordie accent.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You see, Mr. Forster, we’re having
dialog: all new wallpaper. French. New

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to Forster)
dialog: You know how Charles is.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: The best is good enough for me!
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Splendid, Mrs. Dickens. In fact, I

text: Kate stares at him, uncomprehending.
speaker_heading: FORSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: To marry me.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ooh!

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I am very glad to hear it.
text: Dickens comes thundering down the stairs.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Forster. Good Lord. I completely
dialog: lost track of the time.
text: Kate puts out a hand.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charles. We need to pay Signor

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: SIGNOR MAZZINI
text: Seventy-five pounds.

speaker_heading: DICKENS

speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: I‘1l hail us a cab.
speaker_heading: DICKENS

speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Walk? Are you mad?

scene_heading: 10 INT. CHAPMAN AND HALL. OUTER OFFICE - DAY 10
text: A publishing house in The Strand. In the outside office, a
text: nervous young CLERK listens to a heated conversation in the
dialog: other room.
speaker_heading: FORSTER (0.S.)
dialog: Gentlemen, we don’t seem to
dialog: understand one another. I asked you
dialog: a simple question: where is the
dialog: money?
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN (0.S.)
dialog: The money, Mr. Forster—
text: The Man Who Invented Christmas Yellow Revisions January 8, 2016
speaker_heading: FORSTER (0.S.)
dialog: Yes. Money. You know: Pounds,
text: shillings, stumpy, shiners, joeys—
text: A huge CRASH, then silence. The clerk winces.
scene_heading: 11 INT. CHAPMAN AND HALL. INNER OFFICE - DAY 11
text: Forster stands by an overturned tea trolley. Crockery
text: everywhere. He gestures apologetically at the two publishers,
text: CHAPMAN (rather portly and florid ) and HALL (tall and
dialog: angular).
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: I do apologize.
text: He attempts to pick up the broken crockery.
speaker_heading: FORSTER (CONT'D)
text: Bull in a china shop.
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: Please don’t trouble yourself.
text: Forster resumes his tirade.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Charles Bloody Dickens! The best-
dialog: selling bloody author in the
dialog: history of English bloody
dialog: literature —
text: He gestures towards Dickens. Dickens’ lips are pressed
text: together, his attention on a magazine publication. The
text: headline on it reads “Martin Chuzzlewit, A Tedious Journey.”
speaker_heading: FORSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Three of his books you've published
dialog: in the last year and a half. Three.
dialog: So— where is the money?
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: Mr. Forster. Like you, we are as
text: Puzzled as the Egyptians in their
dialog: Fog.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Howzat?
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: The Excitement with which a Popular
dialog: Reputation is Kept up to the

speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: —Martin Chuzzlewit— a Masterpiece
dialog: of the Picaresque Genre— and Yet—
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: Barnaby Rudge— a Fine Book— an
dialog: Important Subject— But— alas—
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: And The Travel book— “American
dialog: Notes”—
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: Perhaps— a Little Too Candid for
dialog: our American Cousins—
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: No joke. I heard they were burning
text: copies in the streets.
text: Forster notices Dickens pained look.
speaker_heading: FORSTER (CONT'D)
text: Mad as snakes, the Yanks.
text: Forster renews his attack.
speaker_heading: FORSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: And what about this fifty pounds a
dialog: month you’re withholding from his
dialog: royalties? What’s the explanation
dialog: for that?
text: The two publishers squirm uncomfortably. Chapman produces the
text: contract and peers at it to cover his nervousness.
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: You May Remember that when Mr.
dialog: Dickens Approached us about the
dialog: Tour to America, we were Pleased to
dialog: Provide Him with an Interest-Free
dialog: Loan —
text: He falters. Chapman continues.
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN

speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Oh, divven’t hoy me that ket, you

text: The publishers exchange glances.
speaker_heading: FORSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: So, he’s had a few flops, who
dialog: hasn’t? Your publishing house
dialog: wouldn't exist without this man!
text: Chapman gives Dickens a nervous look.
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: Actually, we do have a Suggestion—
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: - very Popular with the Reading
dialog: Public —
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: Perhaps Mr. Dickens might consider—
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: — and a lot of Money to be Made in-
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: — a Railway Edition of his works?
text: Dickens is frowning.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: You're not serious? Those cheap
dialog: yellow-backed jobs? With adverts
dialog: for fig syrup on the cover?
text: They all watch as Dickens gets to his feet. He turns the
dialog: magazine publication over to obscure his bad Chuzzlewit
dialog: review.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What about an advance?
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: -- on?
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: (bluffing)
dialog: ..-A new book.
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: You have a New Book in mind?
speaker_heading: FORSTER

dialog: 10
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: Well, in that case, obviously. We'd
dialog: Love to Consider it...
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Consider it?
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: That is to say, If we Like it--
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: If?
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: I’m sure we will--
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Gentlemen. I bid you good day.
text: He sweeps out of the room.
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: Mr. Forster: Please. We had no
dialog: Intention of Causing Offense.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Ay. He’s in a fettle now. Give him
dialog: a day to calm down —
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: And then... It's Most Awkward...
dialog: “He” was in last week. In some
text: Difficulty. Again.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: No, that’s not possible. He’s in
dialog: the countryside. Under strict
dialog: instructions to remain there.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: FORSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it this time?
text: Chapman hands him a letter and an envelope.
speaker_heading: FORSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (reading)
dialog: “,..need money immediately or
dialog: productive of fatal consequences...
dialog: I beseech you to do the needful...”
text: Forster shakes the envelope, causing several SLIPS OF PAPER

scene_heading: EXT. GARRICK CLUB - AFTERNOON 12
text: A Georgian building near Covent Garden, once a private house,
text: now a gentlemen’s club, with a brass plate beside the door:
text: THE GARRICK CLUB. And underneath, the motto: “ALL THE WORLD'S
text: A STAGE.” FORSTER rushes in, umbrella in hand.
scene_heading: INT. GARRICK CLUB. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON 13
text: A cozy dining room, typical of a Victorian men’s club. Beside
text: the bar, a group of SMART YOUNG MEN are gathered, gossiping
text: and making quips. At the centre of the group is a tall fellow
text: with a braying laugh (WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY).
text: Dickens stands by the cloak room, holding a newspaper in
text: front of his face.
speaker_heading: FORSTER (0.S.)
dialog: Charles?
text: Dickens folds down a corner of the newspaper.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Shhh...
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: What are you doing over here?
text: Dickens gestures towards the group.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: I’m hiding. From Thackeray. He’ll
dialog: want to commiserate with me on my
dialog: Chuzzlewit reviews. Which he will
dialog: quote by heart.
text: Forster walks into the dining room. Dickens scuttles after
text: him, taking care not to be seen by Thackeray. Forster grabs a
text: chair and cranes his head around.
text: The Man Who Invented Christmas Yellow Revisions January 8, 2016
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Where’s Robertson? I’m clammin’ for
text: some scran.
text: Dickens slinks into another chair.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Why do we come here? The service is
dialog: terrible. The food is inedible. And
dialog: the fees keep going up —
text: An elderly WAITER appears and bows low, losing his

speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Gentlemen?
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: You're not Robertson.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: The name is Marley, sir.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Marley?
text: Dickens gets out a pencil and a notebook.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: With an e?
text: The waiter’s eyes flicker with apprehension.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Don’t worry. He collects names.
dialog: Let’s have some oysters. And a
text: bottle of champagne.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Very good, sir.
text: The waiter exits, at a stately pace.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Champagne?
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: We're celebrating.
speaker_heading: THACKERAY (0.C.)
dialog: Celebrating?

text: The Man Who Invented Christmas Yellow Revisions January 8, 2016
dialog: 13
text: Thackeray has somehow materialized at their table, an evil
text: glint in his eyes.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Thackeray. How are you?
speaker_heading: THACKERAY
dialog: Tolerable I thank ye. Charles. I
dialog: must say, I’m relieved to see you
text: out and about.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Relieved?
speaker_heading: THACKERAY
dialog: You know. After those vile things
dialog: they wrote about Chuzzlewit. I
dialog: won't even call them reviews.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: No matter, I never read them.
text: Forster shoots him a skeptical look.
text: He waits.
speaker_heading: THACKERAY
dialog: Quite right. Scandalous, what one
dialog: is allowed to print nowadays.
text: Dickens grits his teeth.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Why? What did they say?
speaker_heading: THACKERAY
dialog: “Dull, vapid, and vulgar... Not a
dialog: single character capable of
dialog: exciting the reader's sympathy.”
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I certainly didn’t think it was
dialog: vulgar.
text: Dickens gives him a tight smile.
speaker_heading: THACKERAY (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, look! There’s Macready. Poor
dialog: thing. His Macbeth was absolutely
dialog: shredded in The Times. I must go
dialog: and give him my condolences.
text: Thackeray wafts away to rejoin the group at the bar.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: I’m sick of London. Over-crowded,
dialog: over-priced--

dialog: 14
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: -You love this town-
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: - no place for a man without money.
dialog: Not to mention the bloody fog--
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: It’s your inspiration. You’re what-—
dialog: do-you-call it? Magic lantern.
text: The waiter arrives. He opens the bottle with some difficulty,
text: then bangs a plate of oysters down on the table and leaves.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: I tell you, Forster, my lamp’s gone
dialog: out. I’ve run out of ideas. I feel
dialog: old.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Old. Whssht. You’re a puppy.
text: Forster pours some champagne.
speaker_heading: FORSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: You're exhausted, that’s what. Too
dialog: Many speeches.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: I’ve got one tomorrow, for the
dialog: Children’s Refuge.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: You have to learn to say no.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: How can I? If I can be useful.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: You'll have to. What with your new
dialog: commission.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Forster, I just told you—
text: He stops himself.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: — what commission?
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: From Chapman and Hall. For your

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Do you mind telling me what it's
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Oh, I leave that up to youse.
text: He grins and helps himself to the oysters.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - NIGHT 14
text: Dickens goes through a complicated pre-writing ritual:
text: straightening everything on his desk, paper, ink, pen knife,
text: quills; then rapidly touching his desk ornaments one by one:
text: a CUP with fresh flowers in it, a pair of BRONZE TOADS, a
text: RABBIT, and a CERAMIC MONKEY.
text: He places a blank sheet in front of him, dips his pen in ink,
text: then stares at the paper, once again willing something to
dialog: appear.
text: INK drips slowly from the pen onto the page.
text: He hears a strange, unearthly cry coming from nearby.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Ul-ul-alul-alu!

scene_heading: INT. DICKENS HOUSE. NURSERY - NIGHT 15

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Do we have a new housemaid?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What? Oh, yes. Tara. She’s Irish.
text: Charley adores her.
text: The candle sputters. She lights a new one.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What are you doing?
text: She shows him the stub of the old candle.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: It was only a stub.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: There’s another hour in that.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, really, Charles.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: If you carry on like this, we’ll

text: Kate laughs.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You are funny.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: I’m not joking.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charles. You give money to any and

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: I should have become a journalist.
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: DICKENS

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: And now for this year’s Christmas
dialog: present!
text: Above it, the genial face of a middle-aged man appears, (whom

scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: I am the necromancer, Rhia Rhama
text: Rhoos, educated cabalistically in

dialog: Behold!

text: Behind them we can see a table set for Christmas dinner with

text: Mr. Dickens slips a painted slide into the magic lantern and

speaker_heading: CHILDREN
dialog: Ohhh...
text: Then, a bearded hunter, with a stag over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ahhh....
text: Then, Aladdin and his lantern.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hooray!
text: On the faces of the children, there is a look of utter

text: A terrifying ghost appears next. Young Charles covers his
text: face with his hands.
scene_heading: YOUNG CHARLES
dialog: No. Go away.
text: Mr. Dickens puts his hand on the young boy’s head to comfort
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: Mr. DICKENS
dialog: It’s all right, Charlie. I’m here.
dialog: You're safe.
text: Young Charles climbs into his father’s arms.
speaker_heading: MR. DICKENS (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. PARLOUR - MORNING 19
text: The Dickens children, Charley, MAMIE (age 5), KATE (4),

speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: What is the matter with your

speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Master Corporal Skittles. Sir.
text: He stares fixedly at Walter’s shoes.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Ahem.
text: The little boy self-consciously rubs one on the back of his

speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, Lucifer Box.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hello, Papa.
text: Dickens offers her his handkerchief.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Would you do me the honour?

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Tara, is it?
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Dickens notes the look of adoration on Charley's face.
dialog: Dickens
dialog: I see you’ve made a conquest.
text: Tara ruffles Charley's hair.
speaker_heading: Dickens (CONT’D)
dialog: What were you telling the children
dialog: last night? About the fairies?
text: Tara glances at Mrs. Fisk, nervously.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Only a story my gran used to tell
dialog: us, sir. Back home in Ireland. She
dialog: used to say that on Christmas Eve
dialog: the veil between this world and the

scene_heading: INT/EXT. FREEMASON’S HALL - NIGHT 20
text: On the interior steps of the great hall, a sign announces: “A

dialog: 22
speaker_heading: SOCIETY WOMAN #1
dialog: Thank you for coming. Such an

scene_heading: MRS. GRIMSBY
dialog: Oh, Mr. Dickens. It is such an

speaker_heading: MR. GRIMSBY
dialog: No, I don’t.
scene_heading: MRS. GRIMSBY
dialog: Well, I love them.
speaker_heading: MR. GRIMSBY
dialog: Nonsense. You just like a good cry.
text: Dickens gives him a strained smile.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What is it you particularly object
dialog: to in my books?
speaker_heading: MR. GRIMSBY
dialog: Pickpockets, streetwalkers, charity
dialog: boys. Those people don’t belong in
dialog: books.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Those people? You mean, the poor?
text: They continue outside the building where Dickens indicates to
text: a knot of BARE-FOOT URCHINS, watching from the shadows.
text: Grimsby straightens up.
speaker_heading: MR. GRIMSBY
dialog: Look here, Mr. Dickens. I’m a self-
text: made man. I pulled myself up by my
dialog: own bootstraps, never asked for
dialog: anything from anyone that I wasn’t
dialog: willing to pay for.
text: The Man Who Invented Christmas Yellow Revisions January 8, 2016

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: No help from anyone?
speaker_heading: MR. GRIMSBY
dialog: None.
scene_heading: MRS. GRIMSBY
dialog: Well, Papa did give us a very small
dialog: cotton mill for our wedding.
text: Mr. Grimsby ignores this, whilst shoeing away a poor urchin
dialog: begging for money.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What would you suggest we do about
dialog: “those people”?
speaker_heading: MR. GRIMSBY
dialog: Are there no workhouses?
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Do you know that many people had
dialog: rather die than go there?
speaker_heading: MR. GRIMSBY
dialog: Then they had better do it, and
dialog: reduce the surplus population.
text: Dickens struggles to control his temper.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Will you excuse me? I have a -- I
dialog: must-- good evening.
text: He strides off.
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT 21
text: Dickens strides angrily through the chaotic, noisy streets of
text: London, past WAITERS thrusting handbills into the hands of
text: passersby, CABBIES soliciting fares, a BALLAD SINGER croaking
text: out a tune, a barefooted CROSSING SWEEPER leaping into the
text: street to clear away the manure.
text: A TOOTHLESS MAN in a long cloak approaches emerges out of the
text: crowd and flashes Dickens a lop-sided grin.
speaker_heading: TOOTHLESS MAN
dialog: Care to buy? Hard workers. Suitable
dialog: for factory work or chimney
dialog: sweeping.
text: Moving aside his cloak he reveals two CHILDREN, a boy and a
text: girl, pale and emaciated, clinging to his legs. Dickens reels
text: back in shock.
text: The Man Who Invented Christmas Yellow Revisions January 8, 2016
dialog: 22
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Let them go! Let them go, or I’1l
dialog: have the police after you.
text: The man turns and runs, the children in tow. Dickens tries to
text: give chase across the street, but is nearly knocked over by a
text: large cart drawn by four horses. On the side the words are
text: written: “Warren’s Blacking: The Pride of Mankind”.
text: Dickens freezes. He looks around. The toothless man and his
text: children are gone. Hearing FOOTSTEPS, he gives chase down a
text: darkened alleyway. Faster he goes, left, right, until he is
text: completely disorientated.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 22
text: Turning a corner, Dickens finds himself in the graveyard of a
text: church and collapses under a tree, exhausted. He closes his
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: VOICE #1 (0.S.)
text: I lift up mine eyes unto the hills
dialog: From whence cometh my help
dialog: My help cometh even from the Lord
dialog: Who hath made heaven and earth--
text: A gravelly voice cuts him off.
speaker_heading: VOICE #2 (0.S.)
dialog: -- All right. I’m not paying you by
text: the hour. Skip to the end.
text: Dickens opens his eyes. In the glow of a lantern, a grave-
text: side burial is taking place, attended only by a red-nosed
text: CLERIC in a threadbare black coat, and a LONE MOURNER in a
text: black silk hat, and two stalwart GRAVE-DIGGERS.
speaker_heading: CLERIC
dialog: (rapidly)
dialog: Rest eternal grant to him, O Lord:
dialog: And let light perpetual shine upon
dialog: him. Amen.
speaker_heading: LONE MOURNER
dialog: Amen.
text: The Lone Mourner presses a coin into the clergyman’s hand and
text: strides away, clearly anxious to be gone.
text: The Grave-diggers shuffle towards the grave, spades in hand.
text: Grave Digger #1 points towards the coffin.
speaker_heading: GRAVE DIGGER #1
dialog: Shame, innit? All that money and no-

speaker_heading: GRAVE DIGGER #2
dialog: -- except Old Scratch there.
text: He nods towards the departing Lone Mourner.
speaker_heading: GRAVE DIGGER #1
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: GRAVE DIGGER #2
dialog: His business partner. The meanest
dialog: cur on two legs, so they say.
text: Dickens shrinks against the wall as the Lone Mourner passes
text: him, shooting him a look of pure malice.
speaker_heading: LONE MOURNER
dialog: Humbug.
text: Dickens recoils.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. DICKENS HOUSE - NIGHT 23
text: Dicken returns home, in a state of agitation, muttering to
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Old Scratch... all that money...
dialog: shame...
text: He reaches for the doorknocker when suddenly the door flies
text: open. Dickens reacts as the knocker comes away in his hand.
speaker_heading: MRS. FISK
dialog: Good evening, sir.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Indeed, Mrs. Fisk.
text: He hands her his hat, and heads for the stairs, holds on to
text: the knocker, not quite sure what to do with it, past the
text: dining room where the whole family sits waiting for him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charles?
text: Dickens is oblivious.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Humbug!

dialog: 26
speaker_heading: DICKENS (V.O.)
dialog: It’s about a businessman. Or a

text: dies. But he doesn’t shed a tear.
dialog: Thinks only of the money. And on
dialog: Christmas Eve—
scene_heading: INT. CHAPMAN AND HALL. INNER OFFICE - MORNING 25
text: Dickens paces, flushed with excitement, referring to his
text: hastily scrawled notes.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
text: -—on Christmas Eve— he meets some
dialog: kind of, of, of, I don’t know-
text: He gestures with his hands.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: —supernatural guides— or, spirits
dialog: possibly- who in the course of one
dialog: night, teach him what a miserable,
text: loathsome, selfish toad he is. A
text: short book. Short and sharp. A
dialog: hammerblow to the heart of this
text: smug, self-satisfied age.
text: Forster and the publishers nod their heads with enthusiasm,
text: though it is clear they don’t follow.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a comedy.
text: Forster breathes out, with relief.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Ah-ha!
dialog: Hall
dialog: Brilliant.
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: Does it have a title?
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Yes. It’s called, A Christmas Ghost
dialog: Story... No, uh— A Christmas— Song.
dialog: Ballad. Something like that.
text: Chapman clears his throat, glances at Hall.
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: Intriguing. Really.... Er. One

dialog: 27
text: Dickens’s mouth twitches dangerously.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Why not?
text: Hall leaps into the fray.
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: Well, Christmas: Not what it Used

text: He chortles at his own joke.
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: I mean to say, Does Anyone Still
dialog: Celebrate It? Other than our Clerk?
dialog: Who Never misses an Opportunity to
dialog: Take a Day off with Pay!
speaker_heading: HALL
dialog: Indeed! Ha, ha. More or less an
dialog: Excuse for Picking a Man's Pocket
dialog: every Twenty-fifth of December!
text: Dickens stares at them. Hall shifts uncomfortably. An awkward
dialog: silence.
speaker_heading: CHAPMAN
dialog: What We Mean to Say, Mr. Dickens,
dialog: is, Not Much Market for “Christmas
dialog: Books”... .What?
text: Dickens tries to control his rising temper.
dialog: Dickens
dialog: It is a Christmas book because
dialog: Christmas is— or ought to be— the
dialog: one time of the year when men and
text: women open their shut-up hearts,
dialog: and think of the people below them
dialog: as if they really were fellow-
dialog: passengers to the grave, and not
dialog: another race of creatures
dialog: altogether.
text: Hall nods, vigorously.

speaker_heading: DICKENS

speaker_heading: FORSTER
speaker_heading: WHAT?
speaker_heading: DICKENS

dialog: distribute myself.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Charles. This is madness. Think of
dialog: your finances! Let’s go back and

scene_heading: INT. HADDOCK’S OFFICE - DAY 29
text: Forster and Dickens, in his new clothes, perch on

text: Dickens’s eyes dart around the room: at the PAPERS stained

text: The door flies open and THOMAS HADDOCK, appears, in a faded

speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Mr. Dickens. Mr. Forster. How do

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Very well, thank you, Mr. Haddock.

dialog: Now. How can I be of service?
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Well, sir, it’s about the loan--
speaker_heading: MR. HADDOCK

dialog: What was it?
text: Haddock gets up and starts to rifle through some DOG-EARED
text: FILES on the desk.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: It was rather good news, as I
dialog: recall--
text: Haddock finds a plate of biscuits under one of the files them
text: and offers them to Forster.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Thank you. Ow!
text: The cat has leapt onto his lap.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Mittens! You rascal... What was I--
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: You said you had good news. About

speaker_heading: HADDOCK

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Bankrupt... Disappointing, I

text: Dickens shakes his head, repulsed.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: No. No. No.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: As you wish. Meanwhile, if you

speaker_heading: HADDOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Here's my bill. No rush. Next week
dialog: will be fine.

speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Mm? Something like that.

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Tell you what... why don’t we defer

speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: More? You mean, borrow more?
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Not much— perhaps 300 pounds?

dialog: At, say, twenty-five percent?

speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: God’s teeth!

text: hands it over to Dickens. Dickens examines the cover: a
text: winged vampire with bloody teeth.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: “Varney the Vampire: The Feast of
dialog: Blood.” Any good?
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Oh, yes, sir. Thrilling.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Where did you learn to read?
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: My mum taught me. But then she
dialog: died. So, I had to go to the
dialog: Grubber.
text: Dickens recoils.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: The Workhouse?
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: You won’t tell Mrs. Fisk, will you?
dialog: She'd think I was shirking.
speaker_heading: DICKENS

text: Dickens plucks a book off the shelf: The Arabian Nights.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Read it and tell me what you think.
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: She hesitates.
speaker_heading: TARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Who is Scrimple?
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Scrimple?
speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: When I came in... You was saying—
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: It’s just a name. In a story I’m
dialog: concocting. You get the name right
dialog: and then— if you’re lucky — the
dialog: character will appear.
text: Tara eyes dart around the room.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s not here yet.
text: He smiles. Then is struck by a thought. He starts to pace,

speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Scrantish?
text: Tara tiptoes out, unobserved.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
text: S—c—rarmer—... S—c—r—ungge. No!
dialog: Come on, come on, you old sinner.
text: He closes his eyes, conjuring up the image of the Lone

speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: SCROOGE!
text: A sudden gust of wind makes the fire leap up, the papers fly
text: around the room.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE (0.S.)
dialog: Shut the window! Do you think I am
dialog: made of money?
text: Dickens jumps. Behind him, SCROOGE, dressed as the Lone

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Mr. Scrooge. How delightful to meet

speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: I’m sorry I can’t say the same.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Come now, Mr. Scrooge. Don’t be

speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: Don’t have friends. Don’t need ‘em.
text: Dickens laughs.
speaker_heading: DICKENS

speaker_heading: DICKENS

speaker_heading: SCROOGE

speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: Christmas.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: That’s right.
text: Dickens leans in, pen at the ready. They both jump at the
text: sound of a piercing SCREAM.
speaker_heading: MRS. FISK (0.S.)
dialog: Help! Help! Get it away!
text: Dickens throws open the door.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS 36

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What is going on?
text: He sees Miss Fisk cowering in a corner, as a large RAVEN

speaker_heading: MRS. FISK
dialog: Get it away! The filthy thing!
text: The children laugh and clap their hands as Mr. Dickens waves
text: a cage at the bird.
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: Come on now, Grip. Back in your
dialog: cage, old chap.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Father?
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: Charles! Good day!
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What are you doing here?
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS

speaker_heading: CHILDREN
dialog: Can we keep him?
speaker_heading: GRIP
dialog: Halloa, old girl. Halloa old girl.
text: Mrs. Fisk clutches the edge of the bannister.
speaker_heading: MRS. FISK
text: It’s bad luck. A bird in the house.
dialog: It means death.
text: Dickens motions for his father to move into the parlour.
scene_heading: INT. PARLOUR - CONTINUOUS 37
text: Dickens turns to address his father.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What are you doing back in London?
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: My dear Charles. I will not
dialog: disguise from you, that this is not
text: the ardor with which a loving
dialog: father might be expected—
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: You are supposed to be in Devon.
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: Ha, banishment! Be merciful, say
dialog: ‘death;'
dialog: For exile hath more terror in his
dialog: look—'
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: We had an agreement. I bought you a
dialog: house. Gave you an allowance.
text: Mr. Dickens looks sheepish.
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: And you know how very grateful I
dialog: am. As for me, I’m happy wherever
dialog: the weather. But your Mother— is of
dialog: a more delicate sensibility. The
text: sight of cows causes her actual
dialog: physical pain.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Father—
text: The Man Who Invented Christmas Yellow Revisions January 8, 2016
dialog: 40
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: And then you see, I need to do some
dialog: research in the London Library.
text: Dickens is skeptical of this.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Research?
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: I have a commission from the
dialog: Spectator. To write a feature on
dialog: the Bank Charter Act. The editor
dialog: was greatly impressed by my series
dialog: on Marine Insurance.
text: Kate and Mrs. Dickens appear in the doorway.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Good for you, Father. And I hope
dialog: you and Mother will stay here with
dialog: us.
text: She shoots a look at Dickens.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: The children and I will enjoy

text: Mr. Dickens glances at his son, apprehensively.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: (relenting)
dialog: The Spectator. Most impressive.
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: Thank you my boy...
dialog: (dropping his voice)
dialog: Er. You couldn’t perhaps lend me a
dialog: tenner? The fellow took my last
text: farthing for the cage.
text: Suddenly there is an ominous CRASH in the hallway. They run
text: to see Grip, perched on the new chandelier, causing bits and
text: pieces to fall to the floor.
speaker_heading: MR. DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ll see that’s all cleaned up.
text: The children surround Mr. Dickens, delighted, as Dickens

speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: Humbug.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: Christmas.
text: Dickens sits up.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: What is it but an excuse for
dialog: picking a man’s pocket every twenty-
dialog: fifth of December?...
text: Dickens jumps up and runs to his desk and rapidly goes
text: through his pre-writing ritual.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Yes, yes! Keep going.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: .+-a time for paying bills without
dialog: money....
text: Dickens starts to write, furiously.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE (CONT'D)
dialog: .+.a time for finding yourself a

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Excellent.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: If I could work my will, every
dialog: idiot who goes about with “Merry
dialog: Christmas” on his lips, should be
text: boiled with his own pudding and
text: buried with a stake of holly
text: through his heart. He should.
text: Dickens laughs out loud. He looks at Scrooge,
text: admiringly.
text: The Man Who Invented Christmas Yellow Revisions January 8, 2016
dialog: 42
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Oh, Mr. Scrooge. You and I are
dialog: going to do great things together.
text: Dickens starts scratching away, while Scrooge peers over his
text: shoulder, smiling.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
text: Oh, but he was a tight-fisted hand
text: at the grindstone, Scrooge. A
text: squeezing, wrenching, grasping,
text: scraping, clutching, covetous old
dialog: sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,
dialog: from which no steel had ever struck
dialog: out generous fire; secret, and self-
dialog: contained and solitary as an
dialog: oyster.
text: Dickens glances over his shoulder. Scrooge immediately
text: rearranges his features into a scowl.
text: There is a KNOCK at the door.
speaker_heading: MR. DICKENS (0.S.)
dialog: Charles?
text: Scrooge disappears. Mr. Dickens pokes his head in, smiling.
speaker_heading: MR. DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hard at work?
text: Dickens grits his teeth.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: What can I help you with, Father?
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: I wondered if we might have an
dialog: extra candlestick for our room?
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Of course.
text: He hands him a candlestick. Mr. Dickens eyes a box on the
text: mantelpiece.
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: Oooo. Are those cigars?
text: Mr. Dickens advances into the room.
speaker_heading: MR. DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: I must confess, I have acquired an
dialog: irrepressible habit of smoking
dialog: whilst I write. Shameful, I know.
text: The Man Who Invented Christmas Yellow Revisions January 8, 2016
dialog: 43
text: He pockets the box.
speaker_heading: MR. DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Well. I won’t detain you.
text: He tiptoes out. Dickens picks up the doorknocker from the
text: front door, now sat on his desk, and raps on it a few times,
text: angrily. Scrooge immediately reappears, a look of alarm on
text: his face.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: Don’t do that.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: He’ll think he’s being summoned--
text: Suddenly, the air is filled with a terrible clanking sound,
text: as of chains being dragged up the stairs and the hallway.
text: Scrooge looks terrified.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Too late.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Who is it?
text: Scrooge is too terrified to speak. Dickens picks up his book
text: of names, rapidly flipping through the list.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh...Bunsby. Clennam. Heep...Hexam.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: Stop.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Magwitch?... Marley...
text: The lights in the room dim one by one. Suddenly, the door
text: flies open and the ghost of JACOB MARLEY (bearing a strong
text: resemblance to his solicitor, Haddock), covered in chains,
text: padlocks, cash-boxes and steel purses, appears. Scrooge
text: attempts a smile.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: Jacob? Is that you?
text: Dickens looks at Scrooge.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: You know him?
text: The Man Who Invented Christmas Yellow Revisions January 8, 2016
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: My business partner. Last I saw
text: him, he was dead as a doornail.
text: The ghost gives out a dreadful howl.
speaker_heading: MARLEY
dialog: Business! Mankind was my business!
dialog: The common welfare was my business;
dialog: charity, mercy, forbearance, and
dialog: benevolence, were, all, my
dialog: business. But I did none of these.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: He was never one for a straight
dialog: answer.
text: The ghost gives another howl.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Come in, I pray you.
dialog: 44
text: Marley clanks into the room, dragging his chains.
speaker_heading: DICKENS (CONT'D)
dialog: You are in chains. Tell me why.
speaker_heading: MARLEY
dialog: I wear the chain I forged in life.
dialog: I made it link by link, and yard by
text: yard. I girded it on of my own free
dialog: will, and of my own free will I
dialog: wore it.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Indeed.
speaker_heading: MARLEY
dialog: Is its pattern strange to you?
text: Dickens starts to write.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: «+.. Strange to you....
speaker_heading: MARLEY
dialog: Or would you know the weight and
dialog: length of the strong coil you bear
dialog: yourself?

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: You mean him, surely.

text: Marley leans towards him, confidentially. He walks around
text: Dickens, circling him with a loose chain.
speaker_heading: MARLEY
dialog: Chains man, all around you. Past...
dialog: and present... and what is to come.
text: Dickens stares at him, his mind racing. And with that, Marley

speaker_heading: FLASHBACK:
scene_heading: INT. DICKENS FAMILY HOME - NIGHT 39
text: The children crowd around the Christmas table. Mr. Dickens at

text: A cheer goes up as Mrs. Dickens, sets a large turkey down on

text: intones.
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: Hail to thee blithe turkey. Whose
text: exquisite odours now perfume the
dialog: circumambient air. So let this day
dialog: be fragrant with the love we bear

dialog: everyone.
text: He winks at YOUNG CHARLES, who stares up at him with
text: adoration.
scene_heading: YOUNG CHARLES
dialog: +...every one.
text: Suddenly, the door flies open. A BAILIFF fills the door

speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Mr. John Dickens?
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: That is my name.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: Come with me.
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS

scene_heading: MR. DICKENS

dialog: The matter is a debt of some forty
dialog: pounds and ten shillings. Fourteen

text: The bailiff holds out a set of handcuffs.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF (CONT'D)
dialog: If you please.
text: The deputies enter the room, and start loading household
text: goods onto a cart, furniture, silverware, books, anything
dialog: they can get their hands on.
scene_heading: MR. DICKENS
dialog: Gentlemen! Please! This is all a
text: misunderstanding. A circumstance of
dialog: great moment to me is to be decided
dialog: in the ensuing term —
text: Young Charles bursts into tears.
scene_heading: YOUNG CHARLES
dialog: Tell them to stop. Tell them to
dialog: stop!

text: it falls, shattering on the ground.
scene_heading: INT. DICKEN STUDY- MORNING 40

speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Leech? He’s so prickly. And by no

speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: -Charles. For God’s sake, slow

speaker_heading: FORSTER

speaker_heading: FORSTER

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: I have eleven pages.

dialog: - Eleven?
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: If it weren’t for the constant
dialog: interruptions - you know my
dialog: father’s staying with us?
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Indeed. He could not have come at a

text: (CHARLOTTE WIGMORE, age 25) walking by with a CHAPERONE.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Ooh!
text: Charlotte’s face lights up at the sight of Forster. Her

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Who was that?

dialog: 48
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Charlotte.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: FORSTER

speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: She's a canny lass, is she not?
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Indeed, most amiable.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Amiable? Why man, she’s an angel, a
dialog: sylph, a- I don’t know what.
text: Suddenly Forster bursts into tears. Dickens stares at him,
text: perplexed.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Whatever is the matter?
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Charlotte and I — have come to a
dialog: parting of the ways.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: I thought you said you were
dialog: engaged—
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Were. Her father had no intention
dialog: for her to marry the son of a
dialog: Gateshead butcher.
text: Dickens tries to think what to say.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Perhaps its for the best. The life
dialog: matrimonial... it’s not for
dialog: everyone, old stick.
text: Forster manfully masters his emotions.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: No doubt. No doubt.

speaker_heading: DICKENS

scene_heading: INT. LEECH'S STUDIO - DAY 42

speaker_heading: DICKENS
text: Four wood cuts and four etchings.
text: The cover in red. Hand-coloured.
text: The title in rustic writing. The

speaker_heading: LEECH
dialog: Gilded? That will cost you.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: It must be exquisite. That’s why we

speaker_heading: LEECH
dialog: You’1l have to sell every copy to

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: That is my intention, Mr. Leech.

speaker_heading: LEECH
dialog: Have you brought the manuscript?
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: I'll have something for you ina

speaker_heading: LEECH
dialog: A week? That leaves only four weeks
dialog: to do the illustrations and get it
dialog: to the printers in time for
dialog: Christmas.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Can you do it?
speaker_heading: LEECH
dialog: Mr. Dickens. I am not a hired hand.

speaker_heading: LEECH
dialog: Fifty pounds. Paid in advance. Plus

scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY 43
text: Forster confronts Dickens on the street outside Leech’s
dialog: studio.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Look, Charles, I don’t mean to be

dialog: should consider what happens if you

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: I will finish on time.
text: Forster doesn’t have the heart to pursue it.
speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Quite.

speaker_heading: TARA
dialog: Excuse me, sir. The children’s tea

speaker_heading: FANNY
dialog: There goes my heart.
speaker_heading: DICKENS

speaker_heading: FORSTER

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Well, he’s a miser.
speaker_heading: FORSTER

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: No, but he worships money. It’s the

speaker_heading: FORSTER
dialog: Why?
text: The Man Who Invented Christmas Yellow Revisions January 8, 2016

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Why? What’s the problem?
speaker_heading: FORSTER

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I did. But you don’t know what it’s

speaker_heading: DICKENS

speaker_heading: SCROOGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look! What do you see there? Hmm? A

dialog: Who could ever care for you?
dialog: Certainly not your father. He
dialog: abandoned you.
text: Dickens struggles to his feet, putting distance between him
dialog: and Scrooge.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: He didn’t -- he -- It wasn’t his
dialog: fault.
text: A rotten railing blocking his path. Dickens looks down at a
text: sheer drop into a huge empty blacking vat below. The railing
text: gives way, the squeal of a thousand rats disturbed by the
text: falling woodwork.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: He failed you. Again and again. You

speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: You know me, Charlie. I’m hunger.
dialog: I’m cold. I’m darkness.... I’m the
dialog: shadow on your thoughts, the crack

text: Scrooge turns to see an empty grave, with a blank HEADSTONE
text: in the middle of the warehouse floor. Scrooge nervously edges
text: towards it.
speaker_heading: SCROOGE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Whose grave it that? There’s no
text: name on the headstone.
speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: Why should there be? The man to
dialog: whom this grave belongs never made
dialog: himself useful to anyone but
dialog: himself. No friends. No family.
dialog: Never felt love, or joy, or took
dialog: any kind of pleasure in life...
dialog: It’s time. Mr. Scrooge. We’ve come
dialog: to the end--
text: Scrooge unnerved, turns back to Dickens only to see an earth
text: wall where Dickens was stood.
text: Turning again and then again he realizes he is surrounded by
text: earth walls. Looking up he sees the blank headstone. He
text: realizes he is now inside the empty grave. Dickens appears
text: above, framed by the blacking factory ceiling.
text: Suddenly the walls of the grave start closing in on Scrooge.

speaker_heading: SCROOGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Give me another chance. I beg you.

speaker_heading: DICKENS
dialog: And so we come to the last chapter.
