speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: MARY

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I hate it when people don’t say

speaker_heading: CARRIE-ANNE
dialog: That's terrific. A lot of the

dialog: once, twice a year. Generally they

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm good at keeping company.
speaker_heading: CARRIE-ANNE
dialog: They love conversation. Of course
dialog: we keep it light. Always try and
dialog: cheer them up.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh. Why?
speaker_heading: CARRIE-ANNE
dialog: Well, we just don’t want to bring
dialog: them down. Sometimes all they can
dialog: think about is dying, so they’1l
dialog: inevitably talk about it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Shouldn't we?
speaker_heading: CARRIE-ANNE
dialog: Better if you steer them away from

speaker_heading: CARRIE-ANNE
dialog: This is the common area. We watch

speaker_heading: ANDRA

speaker_heading: MRS. PORTMAN
text: The breast comes off. Just like

speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Wouldn't you rather have a

speaker_heading: MRS. PORTMAN
dialog: What do I need my breast for? Safer

speaker_heading: ANDRA
dialog: You might get a boyfriend and then
dialog: what.
speaker_heading: MRS. PORTMAN
dialog: You're funny, Andra!
speaker_heading: ANDRA
dialog: See? She thinks I’m funny.

speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: I'm so sorry, Mrs. Portman.
speaker_heading: MRS. PORTMAN

speaker_heading: PAULETTE

speaker_heading: EUGENE

speaker_heading: ANDRA
dialog: It’s the truth.

speaker_heading: ANDRA
dialog: But he's very short.

speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Grandma -
speaker_heading: ANDRA

dialog: I was very selective.
speaker_heading: PAULETTE
dialog: Good for you. It’s good to be
dialog: selective.
speaker_heading: ANDRA
dialog: A lot of people were jealous of me.
speaker_heading: PAULETTE
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: ANDRA
dialog: Because I was smart. People often

speaker_heading: REBECCA

speaker_heading: EUGENE
dialog: This can't be it.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Maybe we're too late. Or maybe it’s

speaker_heading: ANDRA
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: PAULETTE
text: We're looking at the view.
speaker_heading: ANDRA
dialog: This is nothing.
text: They stand there for a bit. Then Eugene steps a couple of

speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Grandma.
text: But Andra doesn't hear her.
speaker_heading: REBECCA
dialog: Grandma.
text: Still no response. As Paulette and Eugene share a moment

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Welcome to Face Works. How can I
dialog: help you?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I’m a walk in.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It says you welcome walk ins. I'ma
dialog: walk in.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: We certainly do welcome walk ins.
dialog: What can I do for you today?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I want a facial with Mary, please.
text: He checks his book.

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: She actually had a cancellation, if
dialog: you can wait thirty minutes.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Sure.
text: She sits down in the waiting area and turns on her ipod. The
text: music is VERY LOUD, and the song keeps repeating MOTHERFUCKER
text: over and over. The PEACEFUL WOMAN seated next to her is
text: severely agitated and shoots Abby, whose oblivious, dirty
text: looks. Abby picks at a zit.
scene_heading: INT. FACE WORKS SPA - DAY 104
text: Abby is lying down on the table with steam blowing on her
text: face. Mary is sitting behind her.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It really worked out well, someone
dialog: had just cancelled.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This is quite a surprise.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Rebecca said she thought you could
dialog: do something for my bad skin.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I’m sure I can. We’ll open up these
dialog: pores and clean you out. Ever have
dialog: a facial?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Well, my mom took me for one, once,
dialog: at this really fancy place? She
dialog: thinks it’s good for people to
dialog: spoil themselves, or something.
dialog: Anyway, it didn’t help. They just
dialog: rubbed a bunch of cream on and made
dialog: it worse.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That’s too bad. Well, just know
dialog: it’s not your fault. It’s
dialog: hereditary.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Yeah, my dad supposedly had bad
dialog: skin.
text: Untitled Nicole Holofcener Project 2008 - Yellow 5/19/08 99A.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That's right, he said it was

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: But have you noticed it now?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He doesn’t have acne anymore but I
dialog: think we’ve really improved the
dialog: quality of his skin.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I don’t know what you’re talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (beat, blase)
dialog: He’s come in for facials.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (beat, tensing up)
dialog: My dad?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sure. Hey, Howard Stern gets them.
dialog: A lot of men do.
text: Abby smiles, uncomfortable. She doesn’t understand what Mary
text: is telling her, but she knows it’s making her feel bad.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Anyway, that’s enough steam. Let’s
dialog: get started.
text: She puts the little black eye cups on Abby and then turns a
text: bright light over her face, illuminating every blemish. Mary
text: starts to squeeze the zits.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sorry, honey. It’s not fun.
text: She squeezes hard. Abby braces herself.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Ow ow ow.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So. Your parents will be glad to

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (wincing in pain)
dialog: She did?

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Now your mother can have a bigger
dialog: master bedroom.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: That’s too bad. I mean, I’m sorry
dialog: she died. When did it happen?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Not sure. We found her today, so
dialog: probably last night.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh, here’s a deep one.
text: She goes in for the deep pimple. Abby’s face clenches.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wiggle your toes.
text: Abby wiggles her toes.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t know. It’s supposed to
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (recalling their
dialog: conversation at the
dialog: dinner party)
dialog: That’s like one of those things -
dialog: that we hate?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (not connecting)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You know, like when people won't
dialog: tell you the truth - like if you
dialog: look bad in something?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don’t follow.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Like saying wiggle your toes- it’s
dialog: just like a ...whatever.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So. When did my dad come in here?
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Oh.
text: With the knot in her stomach from what Mary is inferring and
text: the pain from the extractions, hot tears spill out of her
text: little eye cups and run down her cheeks.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (unaware)
dialog: We should give you an enzyme peel.
dialog: That will definitely get all the
dialog: dead skin off. It kind of makes you

speaker_heading: REBECCA

speaker_heading: DARIO

speaker_heading: REBECCA

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: ABBY

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What did she do to you?
speaker_heading: ABBY

speaker_heading: ABBY

speaker_heading: BIG BACK
dialog: I’ve seen you walk by, over and

dialog: you? Why are you watching me?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I’m Brian’s old girlfriend, Mary.
speaker_heading: BIG BACK
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And I guess I wanted to see what he
dialog: threw me over for.
speaker_heading: BIG BACK
dialog: (creeped)

speaker_heading: BIG BACK
