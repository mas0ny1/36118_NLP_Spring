dialog: to do. Then assume they've already done it
dialog: twice.
dialog: Joseph R. Hallenbeck
dialog: Private Investigator
dialog: When you consider that a career in pro foot-
dialog: ball means maybe ten years, after which you
dialog: got no legs left, and during which you're a
dialog: painkiller drug addict, a million a year
dialog: sounds about right. So when people bitch
dialog: at me about the money I made, I have a pat

text: A big MAN lies, shirtless, on the bed.
text: Watching a sports program. We hear:
speaker_heading: SPORTS FIGURE (V.O.)
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: Eliminating the draft? Worst
dialog: thing ever happened to pro
dialog: football. Already you got Eric
dialog: Dickerson, no team's good enough
dialog: for him... You got Dion Sanders,
dialog: this guy, Bosworth, bunch of
dialog: peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him
dialog: play for 25 bucks a game. And he
dialog: woulda played for free, you get
dialog: me? He loved the game. Nowadays?
dialog: Forget about it.
text: The TELEPHONE SHRILLS in the stillness.
text: The Man On the Bed answers it. Speaks haltingly.
speaker_heading: MAN ON BED
dialog: Hello...?
speaker_heading: MALE (V.O.)
dialog: Hello, Billy. Do you know who
dialog: this is?
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MALE (V.O.)
dialog: Kid from Ohio is looking real
dialog: good, Billie...
text: The Man's hand unclenches. A container of pills spills

speaker_heading: MAN ON BED
dialog: I'm... I'm gonna... try real
dialog: hard...
speaker_heading: MALE (V.O.)
dialog: No, Billy. What you're gonna do
text: ... is rush for 150 yards against

speaker_heading: MAN ON BED

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: AERIAL SHOT - SNOWSTORM
text: OVER Chicago, Illinois, as the CAMERA SPIRALS DOWN TOWARD

scene_heading: SOLDIER FIELD, CHICAGO NOVEMBER 14
scene_heading: INT. ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH
text: The BROADCAST TEAM huddles inside the quilted jackets,

speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Good afternoon and welcome to

scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Billy Cole sits, alone, in front of his locker.

dialog: 3.
scene_heading: EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (FOURTH QUARTER)
text: A deafening CRUNCH as a defensive back hammers a wide

text: The back recovers it.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: ... Big Ray Walton puts a

scene_heading: EXT. SIDELINES - SAME TIME
text: The injured player goes by on a stretcher, moaning.
text: Cheerleaders jump and frolic.
speaker_heading: BILLY COLE
text: gets up off the bench. The rest of the offensive unit
text: sprints onto the field. Cole walks. Straight ahead,
text: eyes front. Like a robot. His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the
dialog: soundtrack.
speaker_heading: COLOR MAN (V.O.)
dialog: And so L.A. has a chance to ice
dialog: the game, no pun intended... And
dialog: you gotta be thinking, give the
text: ball to Billy Cole. He has had an
text: outstanding day, racking up 138
text: yards against a tough defense.
speaker_heading: DOWN ON FIELD
text: The huddle breaks.
text: The L.A. team trudges through the snow to the line of
dialog: scrimmage.
text: Cole adopts a three-point stance.
text: Everything happens in hyper-real SLOW MOTION:
text: The snow falls. The receivers breeze past, in motion to
text: begin their patterns. Moving like gazelles.
text: Cole's fingers paw the cold earth. Gouging it.
text: He is like a spring. Coiled and ready.
text: The ball is snapped.
text: Turf and snow. Erupting.
text: A firecracker series of POPS as linemen collide.
text: Legs churning.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The ball floats through the snowy air. Pitch-out to
dialog: Cole.
text: He takes it on the run. Tucks it under his arm.
text: Behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled.
text: Cole turns the corner. Picks up a blocker.
text: Feet pounding. Arms pumping.
text: Up ahead, the free safety barrels toward him. Low and
dialog: hard.
text: Cole does not blink. He reaches beneath his jersey.
text: Pulls out a GUN.
text: Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safety's head.
text: The bullets go straight through. On the back of his
dialog: helmet.
text: A mixture of blood and fiberglass.
text: Cole keeps going, jogging for the end zone.
text: Around him, sound. Fury. Impact. Confusion.
text: Another defensive back. Straight ahead.
text: Reacts with almost comical terror. Dives to one side.
text: Cole FIRES. Blows out the guy's knee. Ends a career.
dialog: Keeps going.
text: We are now in full-scale panic.
text: The players are fleeing the field. Shouts. Pandemonium.
text: A few brave men gather around the fallen players.
speaker_heading: POLICE
text: are on the field now. Running full out. They've got
text: riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the
dialog: snow.
text: Cole crosses the goal line. Touchdown.
text: Drops the ball.
text: Turns, facing the cops. His eyes are insane.
text: The crowd is screaming. People are running back and
text: forth like extras in the Keystone Cops.
text: The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and
text: wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost.
text: The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing
text: like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice.
text: Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him. He
dialog: smiles and says:

text: CAMERA CRANES DOWN PAST a huge, rotting billboard. On

dialog: your butt.
text: MOVE IN ON a tiny, weather-beaten bungalow. In the

text: The sprinkers come to life. Fling water across the car.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Inside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo.
text: Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams
text: V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music.
dialog: Picture the tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch
dialog: self-hating loser you can.
text: Now give him a two-year-old suit from C &amp; R Clothing.
text: Such is the aforementioned HALLENBECK.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KID #1
text: Dude's trashed.
speaker_heading: KID #2

speaker_heading: KID #3
dialog: I know where there's a dead

scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - BUNDLE OF PAPER TOWELS - SOME MINUTES
speaker_heading: LATER

speaker_heading: KID #1
dialog: Do it.
text: They heave the squirrel into the car and run away.
text: A pause. Another pause. The sprinkler goes round.
dialog: Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Hallenbeck snores. The mashed squirrel perches on his

speaker_heading: KIDS

speaker_heading: KID #2
dialog: Goddamn. Dude's trashed.
speaker_heading: KID #3
dialog: Take his bottle.

dialog: patience.
text: Trembling hand inches closer and closer --
text: And closes on the bottle as, without warning --
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
text: sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38
text: revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Hey, motherfucker.
text: The Kid, of course, shrieks.
text: And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes.
text: He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid.
text: Swears under his breath. Watches the boys flee in
text: terror. Notices a dead squirrel in his lap. Scowls.
text: Heaves it out the window. Pumps a Camel into his mouth.
text: Lights it. Rescues the bottle of Seagrams.
text: Thus begins his morning.
text: He opens the car door. The sprinkler douses him.
text: He gets out. Stands on the lawn.
text: One of the Kids, the toughest one, is standing on the
dialog: sidewalk.
speaker_heading: KID #3
dialog: I'm not scared.
text: Hallenbeck scowls.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You're on my property, kid.
speaker_heading: KID #3

scene_heading: EXT. MALIBU BEACH FRONT - MORNING

dialog: 8.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: A plush bedroom. Sun streams in the window.
text: A YOUNG MAN sits, straddling a backwards chair. Bare-
text: foot, bare-chested. Blond hair, perfect tan.
text: He is nursing a beer. Smoking and staring at --
speaker_heading: BED
text: where a tawny golden girl lies, serene and innocent.
text: Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast
text: exposed. No tan line.
text: The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the
text: sleeping girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old,
dialog: former National League heartthrob.
text: He shakes his head and mutters:
speaker_heading: JIMMY (YOUNG MAN)
dialog: Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so
dialog: damn ugly.
text: He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass
text: vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it
text: up a nostril.
text: For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - FOOTBALL FIELD
text: Seventy thousand people screaming.
text: Jimmy in the middle. Younger Jimmy. Fresher Jimmy.
text: It's a night game at the Coliseum. He's the quarterback.
text: The snap. Jimmy fakes the draw. Rolls right. Around
text: him, all is impact. Sound and fury.
text: He targets a receiver and unleashes a rocket. Sixty-
text: yard toss, hits the guy between the numbers.
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S FACE
text: Covered with dirt and mud. Blood, too.
text: Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he's
text: alive. He makes a difference.

text: BACK TO PRESENT
text: Alone in the bathroom... leaning on the counter. Head

speaker_heading: SLEEPY VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Jimmy, are you still here...?
dialog: Pause, then:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don't know.
text: He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah. I guess I am.
text: He sniffs, clearing his nose.
scene_heading: INT. WEST L.A. BUNGALOW - MORNING
text: Hallenbeck opens the door and shambles in.
text: Dark. Depressing. Sprawl of furniture. Stack after
dialog: stack of sports magazines. Drop all your belongings out
dialog: of a plane. They will land like this.
text: He flicks on the light. Crosses to the couch and flops
text: down. Plucks a bottle of aspirin from an end table.
text: Next to the bottle, we see --
scene_heading: TWO FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS
text: side by side. In one, younger Hallenbeck is kissing
text: younger bride. Smiling.
text: In the other, the President of the United States presents
text: Hallenbeck with a medal. They are both smiling beneath
dialog: the Presidential Seal.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Hallenbeck scowls and chews three aspirin. Swallows.
text: The PHONE RINGS. He groans. Chain-lights another smoke,

text: Blotchy skin.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

scene_heading: EXT. BUNGALOW - MORNING

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

text: Pads out onto a redwood deck.
scene_heading: EXT. REDWOOD DECK - SAME

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Don't tempt me.
text: He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed. Stalks into
dialog: the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Damn raccoon.
text: He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet.
text: Walks back out into the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: He kneels, looks under the bed.
text: Frowns.
text: Straightens and says, very conversationally:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Who's the guy in the closet?
text: Sarah stops dead. Spins and stares at him.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (frowns)
dialog: Oh, that's right, you sometimes
dialog: forget that I'm a detective.
dialog: (lights a cigarette)
dialog: See, first I noticed how tense you
dialog: were, but I let that pass. Then
dialog: I noticed there was steam in the
dialog: shower like someone was just in
dialog: there, but meanwhile your hair is
dialog: completely dry, you follow? So.
dialog: Why the steamy shower?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK (CONT'D)
dialog: Because someone else was in there,
dialog: right, and since he's not under
dialog: the bed you must have stuck him in
dialog: the closet when you heard my key in
text: the door a day early. Tah-dah.
dialog: Please, no applause.
text: A silence hangs between them. Sarah just stares. Shakes
text: her head.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Well, nothing changes. You're
text: still a lunatic.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Mmmmm. I'm sorry, honey, I don't
dialog: enjoy being observant, but someone's
dialog: gotta do it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What's his name?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Please leave. I have to get dressed.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: It's okay, I've seen you naked. So,
dialog: apparently, has someone else. What's
dialog: his name?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You want me to open the closet, Joe?
dialog: Huh? You want me to indulge your
dialog: fucking paranoia, I'll throw the
dialog: door open, is that what you want me
dialog: to do...?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Is this a trick question?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then
dialog: we'll both know you're a psycho,
dialog: is that what you want? Huh??
text: An awkward pause. Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: No. We won't open the door.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (sighs)
text: Nope. Door stays shut. Instead,
dialog: what I'm gonna do is...
text: (he scoops up the
dialog: .38)
dialog: ... I'm gonna count to three, and
dialog: then I'm gonna put a bullet in
dialog: there, and you can stop me anytime
dialog: by speaking the truth. One.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: If you shoot up my house, Joe, I
dialog: will make you eat that gun.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Two. The truth is a beautiful
dialog: thing.
text: He cocks the hammer. Arm extended, hand rock steady.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Call your shrink, Joe. I still
dialog: have the number. Call him and tell
dialog: him you're losing it, I cannot
dialog: fucking deal with you like this -- !
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Three. Last chance.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Joe, dammit -- !
text: He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger. And Sarah
dialog: screams --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Jesus, no -- !
text: And grabs the gun.
text: Everything freezes. She looks at him. He looks at her.
text: Understanding occurs.
speaker_heading: CLOSET DOOR
text: swings slowly open, then...
text: And out steps a man in a bathrobe.
text: Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet.
text: None other than MIKE MILLER, Joe's early morning phone call.
dialog: We know this because Joe says:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Hello, Mike. Keeping her warm
dialog: for me?
text: The gun barrel does not waver. Not an inch.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Easy, Joe. Don't do nothing dumb.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: How as she, Mike? On your finger
dialog: scale, how was my wife...?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: It just happened, Joe. It just
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You call me from here this morning?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: She said you were in Vegas. I was
text: gonna leave a message on the machine.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: When you found out I was back. Why
dialog: didn't you split?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: She said relax, he never stops home
text: once he's in the office.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Normally I wouldn't.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: (stares at him)
dialog: You knew?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I suspected. So how about it, Mike?
dialog: On a scale of one to ten. How was
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Joe, come on, how long we been
dialog: friends, huh?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: How long? Mmm. I'd say roughly
dialog: until you put your dick in my
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You gotta understand --
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I know, I know, it just happened.
dialog: It was an accident. Sure. You
dialog: tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and
dialog: accidentally fucked my wife. Gee,
dialog: Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my
dialog: week. Sure, Mike. Happen to
dialog: anybody.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't gotta understand anything.
text: Sarah speaks then. Head down. Eyes averted.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: Put the gun down.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Hmmm? Oh, right, the gun.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts.
text: He pulls the trigger.
text: The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room.
text: Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself.
text: The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head.
text: On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the
text: one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead
dialog: center.
text: Blows it to pieces.
text: Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor.
text: Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Where was Darian?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: She stayed at Cindy's last night.
text: He nods. Turns and waves the gun at Miller.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Let's take a walk, Buddy.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
text: The two men come out the back door and cut through the
dialog: hedge.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Miller's car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is parked at the curb.
text: Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard.
text: Holsters his gun.
text: A neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail.
text: Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Where you want it, Mike? Head
dialog: or gut?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Listen, Joe, I --
dialog: (stops, sighs)
dialog: Gut.
text: Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back
text: foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's
dialog: gut.
text: Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch.
text: Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: If I see you again, I'll kill
dialog: you.
text: Miller nods weakly. Gasping for breath.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: So. West Hollywood at seven, right?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Huh...?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: The job. Seven o'clock, right?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: You still... want the job...?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: It's two hundred bucks.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Yeah. I guess it is.
text: He climbs to his feet, still doubled over.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I'm sorry, Joe.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Hallenbeck says nothing. Miller turns and stumbles to
text: his car. Hallenbeck's face betrays nothing. A dead mask.
text: He walks back toward the hedge.
text: The neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth.
text: Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird.
text: Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. Throws it.
text: The DOG BARKS and bounds after it.
text: Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition.
text: The CAR BLOWS to pieces.
text: An ERUPTION OF FLAME.
text: Flying glass and metal. The car becomes airborne.
text: Engulfed in fire. Does a lazy spin. Comes down.
text: The shockwave catches Hallenbeck. Slams him ass over
text: teacups.
text: Windows blow in up and down the street.
text: Smoke and fire roll to the sky.
text: The DOG cowers, HOWLING in fear.
text: Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire.
text: Hallenbeck rolls to his feet. Covered with twigs and
text: leaves. Clothing scorched. Stares. Eyes glazed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AN HOUR LATER
text: A mobile crane hoists what's left of Mike Miller and his
text: Pontiac. Policemen direct traffic, curb bystanders.
dialog: OFF TO ONE SIDE
text: a UNIFORM COP questions Hallenbeck and Sarah, who stand
text: stiffly. Not looking at each other.
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP
dialog: Why did Mr. Miller visit your home
dialog: this morning, Mr. Hallenbeck?
dialog: Joe lies easily:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: He came by to talk business. He
dialog: had a case he was to busy to continue
text: with, a routine surveillance. He
dialog: farmed it out to me.
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP
dialog: I see. Is that all you talked
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Yeah. That's all.
text: He looks the Officer in the eye. Betrays nothing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: NAKED, GYRATING BODY
dialog: Female, for the record. Signaling us that we are now:
scene_heading: INT. "BOTTOMLESS PIT" CLUB - NIGHT
dialog: Rowdy strip club in West Hollywood. Just like the name
dialog: suggests; if it's a virus, you're sitting on it. After
dialog: three drinks, every girl on stage looks like your high
dialog: school sweetheart. Was your sweetheart fat? Did she
dialog: have excessive body hair?
text: FUNK MUSIC, played LOUD. The Monday crowd stomps and
text: claps. Onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm
text: usually reserved for standing in line at the DMV.
text: Jimmy Dix sits at the bar, hooting and whistling. Behind
text: the bar, a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks. His
dialog: name is HARP.
text: Off to one side, a twenty-five-year-old BEANPOLE speaks
text: into a microphone:
speaker_heading: EMCEE (BEANPOLE)
text: Flash of green buys a flash of
dialog: pink, gentlemen. So reach into
dialog: your pockets if you aren't there
dialog: already, and reward the lovely
dialog: and talented Ms. Vixen...!
text: The black man shakes his head.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HARP
dialog: My son. He writes his own
dialog: material, he's proud of that. Some
dialog: people are proud, they cured
text: leukemia. Old guy stops beating
dialog: off long enough to laugh, my son
dialog: thinks he's Eddie Murphy.
text: Jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Alex the astronaut.
text: Harp raises his own glass.
speaker_heading: HARP
dialog: Alex the astronaut.
text: It seems to be a common ritual between them. Jimmy
text: drinks, thumps the bottle down. Says, resolutely:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I've had it, Harp.
speaker_heading: HARP
dialog: Had what?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: It, man. I've had it.
dialog: (takes a swig)
dialog: I don't remember what I did last
dialog: night. I'm an idiot, Harp, I act
dialog: like a complete dickhead. I don't
dialog: have friends. I drink too much.
dialog: I fuck anything that's warm and
dialog: breathing.
speaker_heading: HARP
dialog: Stay on that side of the bar.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I cheated on my girl friend again.
speaker_heading: HARP
dialog: You cheated on her? You must be
dialog: crazy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so.
text: His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on --
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS
text: Who makes her way between the tables. She is beautiful.
text: Stands out like a teamster at a gay rights rally. Supple
text: body. Deep green eyes. Flaxen hair. Her name is CORY.
text: She stops at a table against the wall. Puts down a
text: Seagrams V.O. in a rocks glass.
text: Seated at the table is a broad-shouldered man in a bad
text: suit. The essence of boredom. Looks like he's been
text: there three days. A cloud of smoke hangs around his
dialog: head. Mr. Joe Hallenbeck, no less.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: The police won't help you, huh?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Sure. After I'm dead they'll
dialog: perform the autopsy.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Guess you don't want to wait that
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Guess not.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (scowls)
dialog: They only play this kind of music?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: What did you expect?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Pat Boone? The Four Freshmen?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: What are you, my father?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Yes, I'm your father. Get your
dialog: clothes on.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I hate this funk shit. It's gonna
dialog: be an extra hundred bucks.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: You're hilarious. Sit next to
dialog: the speaker, you'll get used to
dialog: it. After a while you'll be
dialog: screaming play that funky music
dialog: white boy.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: The screaming part I believe.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She smiles and moves away.

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The lovely Cory approaches Jimmy at the bar. Harp looks

speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: (seductive)
dialog: Hello, handsome. How'd you like
dialog: to buy me a bottle of champagne?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How much for a bottle?
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Forty dollars.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No thanks. Nothing personal, my
dialog: seventh grade teacher was killed
text: by a drunk driver.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Tall guy? Sandy hair?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's the one.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: I had to swerve three times to
dialog: get him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Ha-ha.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: So no bottle, then?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: For forty bucks I'd rather drink
dialog: my own piss.
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: That's extra.
text: And with that, she leans over and moulds her lips to his.
text: Time passes. These two know each other, it would seem.
text: Cory pulls away. Jimmy smiles.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: CORY

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: He's nobody.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I have to get ready to dance.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Come back soon. I want to buy
dialog: you a drink.
text: She smiles and moves off, swishingly. Jimmy watches her

text: frowns.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Near the stage, the would-be Eddie Murphy steps up to
dialog: the mike and says:
speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: You know, crowd, these ladies are
dialog: fine, but let me tell you the three
dialog: reasons men prefer sheep: they're
dialog: always in the mood, they never
dialog: bitch, and after you fuck 'em you

speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: (plowing ahead)
dialog: And now, here's a lady that's
dialog: always in the mood, put your hands
dialog: together for the lovely and
dialog: talented Ms. Cory...!
text: Applause. A syncopated DRUM BEAT kicks in. AEROSMITH'S

text: And then she comes on.
text: And even Joe Hallenbeck must draw in a sharp breath.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Her body is exquisite. She moves like breath. Her eyes
dialog: can put you under. She is simply that beautiful.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
text: sits with his drink untouched before him. Pats his
text: suit pockets, searching for a smoke. Removes a crumpled,
dialog: empty pack, as:
speaker_heading: JIMMY DIX
text: saunters up, looking less than friendly. He looks at
text: Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck does not look at him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hi. You're nobody.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Shhh. Don't tell anyone.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's what Cory said. She said
dialog: you were nobody.
text: Only Hallenbeck's eyes move. He looks up, regards Jimmy
text: coolly. They size each other up. Hallenbeck sighs.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Easy, Junior, I'm not raining on
dialog: your parade. She's too young for
dialog: me. I'm just keeping an eye on
dialog: her for a few days.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I see. What are you, some kind
dialog: of bodyguard?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Something like that. You got a
dialog: cigarette?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No. Is Cory in trouble?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I hope not. You tell me.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: She didn't mention anything to me.

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Where's Mike?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Look, friend, I don't know who you

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: That's client confidential.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

scene_heading: INT. DINGY DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Cory and Jimmy are engaged in very hot sex.
text: This is not a love scene; this is a sex scene.
dialog: Sigh. I'm not even going to attempt to write this
dialog: quote-unquote "steamy" scene here, for several good
dialog: reasons:
dialog: A) The things that I find steamy are none of your damn
dialog: business, Jack, in addition to which --
dialog: B) The two actors involved will no doubt have wonderful,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

text: Shakes his head again. Walks to the end of the corridor.
text: Goes through the fire door. Out into:
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Starry, moonlit night. A chill breeze. Joe draws a
dialog: breath.
text: In front of him, on the wall of the club, is a poster:
text: BAYNARD FOR SENATE, it reads. Above the logo, a picture

text: Hallenbeck regards it balefully.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

text: Their voices are fuzzy.
speaker_heading: HITMAN #1
text: That's him. He was with her.
speaker_heading: HITMAN #2
dialog: Shit, he's packing. What should
dialog: we do?
speaker_heading: HITMAN #3
dialog: Get him away from here. Then kill
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: HITMAN #2
dialog: There's no contract for him.
speaker_heading: HITMAN #3
dialog: Then do it for free. Just do it
dialog: elsewhere.
text: The men disperse. One of them drags Joe to his feet.
text: A stocky, crag-faced man. He jams a silenced pistol
text: in Joe's kidney and points him toward a vacant lot
dialog: nearby.
speaker_heading: HITMAN #2
dialog: Start walking. I'm right behind
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The two other Hitmen return to their gray, late-model
text: sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the
dialog: nightclub.
dialog: Waiting.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT
text: A rusty chain-link fence separates the lot from the boule-
text: vard. Choked with weeds. Broken glass. A rusted-out car.
text: A towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to
dialog: drink Scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell.
text: Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot.
text: The crag-faced man follows behind him.
speaker_heading: CRAG-FACE (HITMAN #2)
dialog: Wrong place at the wrong time,
dialog: buddy, that's all it is. Just
dialog: want you to know it's nothing
dialog: personal.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: That's what you think. Last night
dialog: I fucked your wife.
text: The gunman cracks up. Hallenbeck grins drunkenly.
speaker_heading: CRAG-FACE
dialog: Oh, you did, huh? How'd you know
dialog: it was my wife?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: She said her husband was a
text: greaseball with bad breath.
text: The guy cracks up again.
speaker_heading: CRAG-FACE
dialog: You're pretty cool for a guy gonna
dialog: take a bullet.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: After fucking your wife, I'll take
dialog: two.
text: The hitman wheezes laughter. Joe just grins.
speaker_heading: CRAG-FACE
dialog: You're a funny guy. It's a shame
dialog: to take you off. Here, kneel down.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Are you kidding? We barely know
dialog: each other.
text: The hitman is now giggling, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: CRAG-FACE
dialog: This is wild. I never shot no

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: CRAG-FACE
dialog: Come on, cut it out. Head or chest?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: That's what your wife said.
speaker_heading: CRAG-FACE
dialog: Would you quit with the wife?
dialog: Enough is enough.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Ask me how fat she is.
speaker_heading: CRAG-FACE
dialog: How fat is she?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: She's so fat I had to roll her in
dialog: flour and look for the wet spot.
dialog: You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap
text: her thigh and ride the wave in.
dialog: (the hitman loses it)
dialog: Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except
dialog: when you poke her in the stomach,
dialog: she farts. I got a buddy he's an
dialog: archaeologist, organized an
dialog: expedition to her chin. They got
text: lost in her nasal hair. But
dialog: seriously, her eyes are like the
dialog: streets of Paris: crossed.
dialog: They're so crossed when she cries
text: the tears run down her back.
dialog: She's got back-tearia.
speaker_heading: CRAG-FACE
dialog: (can't stop laughing)
dialog: Oh, that's awful. Buddy, you're a
dialog: fucking rio --
text: From a kneeling position, Hallenbeck flings a handful of
text: gravel at the man's eyes.
text: The man cries out. Stumbles backward.
text: And Hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring. Not drunk at
text: all. He takes the broken bottle he's been clutching and
text: cuts the guy's throat like a knife through butter.
text: The hitman stands with a shocked look on his face.
text: Blood bubbling.
text: FIRES the GUN once, into the ground. Drops it from nerve-
text: less fingers. Stares at Hallenbeck, aghast.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CRAG-FACE
dialog: Bastard.
text: Hallenbeck meets his gaze. A savage, feral gleam in his
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: And then some.
text: The guy pitches over dead.
text: Hallenbeck kneels beside him.
text: Retrieves his .38, holsters it. Slips the hitman's pistol
text: into his waistband.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th.
text: He takes off running.
scene_heading: EXT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
text: Cory and Jimmy emerge from the club into the parking lot.

speaker_heading: CORY

dialog: I'm staying at a motel for a couple
dialog: days. Will you follow me?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sure.
text: He heads for his car.

scene_heading: EXT. BOULEVARD - NIGHT

text: Headlong down the sidewalk. Gasping for breath.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Move!!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He slams into a man. Knocks him flat. Groceries fly.

scene_heading: EXT. NIGHTTIME STREET - SAME TIME
text: Jimmy Dix is behind the wheel of a silver Jag.
text: Cory is driving a spanking new Ford Fiero.
text: Jimmy follows behind Cory, watchdogging. Humming with
text: JOE COCKER on the RADIO.
text: Cory comes to a red light. Pauses. Turns right onto a
dialog: sidestreet.
text: Jimmy slows, pausing at the intersection.
speaker_heading: GRAY SEDAN
text: passes Jimmy. Accelerating. ENGINE REVVING.
text: Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car.
dialog: It's enough:
text: Everyone inside is armed to the teeth.
text: The SEDAN ROARS around the corner, cutting in front of
dialog: Jimmy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh God. This is a hit this is a
dialog: fucking hit!!
speaker_heading: GRAY SEDAN
text: comes up behind Cory. Comes up fast.
text: Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch
dialog: -- And stalls out.
text: He roars with anger.
text: Flings open the door.
text: Leaps out and runs forward, screaming:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Cory, get out of there!!
text: Too late. Cory is already out of her car, yelling:
speaker_heading: CORY
dialog: Hey, can't you fucking drive??
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Her eyes go wide with shock.
text: The Hitmen burst from their car. OPEN UP on full auto.
text: Cory is cut down. Blown backward over the hood of her
text: Ford. Flung to the street.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh Gooood!!
text: And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn --
text: And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy.
text: He takes a running start.
text: Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap.
text: BULLETS DICE the metal behind him.
text: He lands, hard. Sucks the ground. Huddled behind his
dialog: car, as:
speaker_heading: TWO HITMEN
text: move toward him, triggering THREE SHOT BURSTS.
text: The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without
dialog: warning --
speaker_heading: JOE HALLENBECK
text: charges into the intersection. Screaming bloody murder.
text: He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING.
text: One Hitman dies immediately:
text: Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire.
text: Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD.
text: The second Hitman turns and OPENS UP on Hallenbeck.
text: Too late. Joe rolls behind a mailbox.
text: BULLETS chase him, blowing apart the metal box.
text: The Hitman swears. Turns, running for the sedan.
text: He knows when a getaway is in order.
dialog: Just one problem. He forgot about Jimmy Dix.
text: A SCREECH of TIRES.
text: As Jimmy's Jag slews around the corner, laying rubber.
text: Rockets toward the Hitman, pins him in its headlights --
text: The Hitman screams as Jimmy plows through him --
text: And CRUNCHES into the gray sedan.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Shatters the Hitman between the two cars...
dialog: And holy Christ, the guy's still alive.
text: Pinned like a butterfly, legs broken...
text: He raises his rifle, screaming.
text: Jimmy dives flat on the front seat. The WINDSHIELD ERUPTS.
text: The Hitman. Still pinned. Still screaming.
text: He FIRES SHOT AFTER SHOT into Jimmy's car.
text: Hallenbeck walks up behind him.
text: Puts a BULLET in his head. He stops screaming.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken
text: glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Hey.
dialog: (as Jimmy looks up)
dialog: Back up.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car backs up.
text: Steam pouring from the crumpled hood.
text: The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street.
text: Like a sack of flour.
text: Hallenbeck limps toward him, wheezing.
dialog: He stops as:
speaker_heading: MOTEL MANAGER
text: stands outside a door marked OFFICE.
text: Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck.
text: Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: It's all over, compadre.
speaker_heading: MANAGER

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (scowls)
dialog: Sidewalk belongs to the government.
text: He turns and looks at Jimmy. The kid is in pain.
text: Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body. Eyes glazed.
text: Hallenbeck says nothing. He crosses to the shattered
text: Hitman. Kneels down, fishes through the guy's coat
text: pockets. Comes up with a bloody pack of cigarettes.
text: Extracts one. Lights it.
text: SIRENS fill the air.
text: And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his
text: coat -- Takes out the vial of coke. Ditches it.
text: Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight.
text: No one sees him do it.
speaker_heading: POLICE CRUISERS
text: come SQUEALING up, flashers turning.

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I don't know. Pretty strapped, I

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Always kept an eye out for work?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No hooking, if that's what you mean.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: It isn't. Tell me what she did at

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The usual. Waitressing. Get a guy
dialog: to buy you a bottle of champagne.
text: Sit in a private booth, let the

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Fine.

speaker_heading: JIMMY

dialog: hard evidence. Otherwise, it's
dialog: 'I never said that,' his word
dialog: against hers.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Right. So what does she do?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don't know. Follow the guy? Have

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

dialog: Then they took out Cory.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Christ, what did the two of them

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

text: Jimmy stares at him, puzzled.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I thought you were off the case.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (scowls)
dialog: Look, dipshit, I told you that to
dialog: keep you out of my hair.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: My client's dead and I haven't
dialog: earned my fee.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Whoa, back up. You mean, we're
dialog: gonna nail these fuckers after
dialog: all...?
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Damn. I knew there was a hero
text: lurking beneath that gruff
dialog: exterior.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Yeah, I'm a prince. Shut the fuck
dialog: up.
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: EXT. ADULT LIVING COMPLEX - NIGHT
text: Jimmy and Hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk
text: between tiny, palm-shaded cottages. The moon casts a
text: pale glow.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Bet these places run a fortune.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Tell me about it. I'm paying the
dialog: fucking rent.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: How charming. Sounds like a great
dialog: girl. What else did you spring
dialog: for? Clothes? Car payments?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Wasn't like that. Cory could've
dialog: had lots of rich guys. Me, she
dialog: loved.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Oh. Love. Well, forget about it,
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Let me guess. You don't believe
dialog: in love.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (lights a cigarette)
dialog: I believe in cancer. I believe in
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What, they're both diseases?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Something like that.
text: Jimmy shakes his head sadly.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Man, I don't want to meet the
dialog: bitch that fucked you up.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I'm sure she'd love meeting you.
dialog: Probably blow you on the front
dialog: porch.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Little bitter, Joe?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Eat shit.
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: EXT. MOONLIT COTTAGE
text: The two men approach the door. Jimmy takes out his key
dialog: ring.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: The cops are gonna want to check
dialog: this place out, so don't disturb
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yes, massah.
scene_heading: INT. COTTAGE
text: Jimmy opens the door. Flips on the lights. Stops in
dialog: his tracks.
text: The room has been systematically torn to pieces.
text: A knife has been used to rip open the couch.
text: Broken furniture, shredded clothing. Everywhere.
text: It looks like a combat zone.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I think someone disturbed some
dialog: stuff, Joe.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Well, shit. Looks like somebody
dialog: beat us to it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Beat us to what?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Whatever evidence Cory was
dialog: holding.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Assuming there was any. Stay here
dialog: a minute.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Bathroom. You wanna come with me?
dialog: Doctor said I shouldn't lift
dialog: anything heavy.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I'll pass.
text: Hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage.
dialog: 57.
scene_heading: INT. CLUTTERED BATHROOM
text: Jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him.
text: He scans the floor, covered with clothes, bottles, etc.
text: Picks up a carelessly discarded can of Right Guard
dialog: deodorant.
text: Turns it upside down, and unscrews the bottom.
text: Inside, the can is hollow and empty. The perfect hiding
dialog: place.
text: Jimmy heaves a sigh of relief. Removes a little plastic
text: Baggie filled with white powder. Stashes it in his
dialog: shorts.
text: Starts to replace the lid. Stops. Frowns.
text: Reaches into the can a second time --
text: And pulls out a yellow envelope.
text: He looks at it, perplexed.
text: Puts it in his pocket. Replaces the lid. Tosses the can
text: on the floor. Flushes the toilet. Leaves.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Hallenbeck, meanwhile, is prowling the living room,
text: looking at photographs on the walls.
text: The girl in the photos seems young, beautiful, and naive.
text: One shot depicts Cory and a friend in cheerleader outfits.
text: On it is scrawled, GOOD LUCK IN HOLLYWOOD BABY! LOVE,
speaker_heading: JANIS
text: Hallenbeck gazes around the devastated cottage.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Looks like you made it, baby.
text: Jimmy emerges from the bathroom.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Find anything?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Yeah, there's some really nice

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I may have something.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Later. Let's get out of here.
scene_heading: EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
text: The two men emerge from the house. Joe heads for his
text: car. Jimmy peels off toward a battered GMC Pacer parked
text: at the curb.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Where the hell are you going?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: As long as we're here, I might as
dialog: well take Cory's car.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You got the keys?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah. I'll follow you.
text: Hallenbeck starts to turn away. Jimmy gets in the car.
text: Hallenbeck stops. Frowns.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Cory has two cars?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Yeah. This one's just sitting
dialog: here until she can sell it.
text: The color drains from Hallenbeck's features.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Jimmy, no!!
text: He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the
text: driver's seat before he can key the ignition.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Ouch -- ! What's your problem?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires, glinting
text: in the moonlight.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: They used a car bomb on Mike, it
dialog: figures they'd try it on her, too.
dialog: (stands)
dialog: Except they wired the wrong car.
text: Jimmy pales noticeably.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh. Shit. Oh. Jeez.
text: Hallenbeck claps him on the back.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Easy, kid. No harm, no foul. We
dialog: caught it in time.
text: He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling.
text: Cheerfully unaffected.
text: Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard.
text: Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Gotta disconnect the fucker.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we
dialog: call the bomb squad or something?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Relax, Junior, I used to do this
dialog: for a living.
text: He isolates one wire. Turns and offers the cutters to
dialog: Jimmy.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You wanna do it?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: No, man, I --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Come on, chickenshit. Just snip
dialog: the wire.
text: Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath
text: the wheel well. Plucks at the wire tentatively. Cuts.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Oh, shit not that one!
text: Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass.
text: Hallenbeck is chuckling softly. Shakes his head as he
text: walks around to release the hood.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: You're a fucking asshole!
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: And then some, Junior. And then
dialog: some.
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
scene_heading: THREE STICKS OF DYNAMITE - ONE MINUTE LATER
text: have been taped to the car's ignition system. Hallenbeck
text: removes the taped bundle. Holds it up for inspection.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: We'll hand this over to the cops.
dialog: They can analyze it.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Great. So what now?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: You tell me, kid.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Give up? Flee? Go really far
dialog: away?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I got a better idea. Let's check
dialog: in with my family.
text: They start walking toward Hallenbeck's Plymouth.
text: Hallenbeck tosses the car keys to Jimmy.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I'm tired. You drive.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sure. Family, huh? You got kids?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Yeah. Little girl.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Does she like you?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Not much, no. And she likes
dialog: Prince, so go figure.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I like Prince.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Great, you can marry my daughter.
dialog: Or better yet, fuck my wife. I
dialog: hear all it takes is a credit card
dialog: and two valid I.D.'s.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Open the trunk.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (indicating bomb)
dialog: You're just gonna stick that in
dialog: your trunk?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (nods)
dialog: You're right. Let's leave it
dialog: here for the neighborhood kids
dialog: to play with.
text: Jimmy opens the trunk. As he does, however, a voice
text: rings out suddenly from the darkness.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Hold it right there, gentlemen.
text: They stop. Slowly they turn.
speaker_heading: TWO MEN
text: are approaching from out of the trees.
text: One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy.
text: The other carries a silenced Beretta.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Is it the cops?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: No, Jimmy. It's not the cops.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Working quickly, Hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside
text: of the truck lid. Slams it shut. Turns, facing the new
text: arrivals.
text: The MEN wear tailored suits with matching ties.
text: One is tall and lean. The other is a bruiser, short and
text: stout. They both have the seasoned look of professional
dialog: mob hitters.
text: The Taller Man speaks, gun held rock steady.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late
dialog: for a stroll, don't you think?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Yeah, you two better be getting
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: The streetlights are on.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: That's amusing. How delightful
dialog: to find such amusing men so late
dialog: at night.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't believe I've had the
dialog: pleasure.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: No, I don't believe you have.
dialog: (to Jimmy)
dialog: He'd like to have the pleasure.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Tell him it's not for sale.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: He says it's --
speaker_heading: SHORT MAN
dialog: What's your name, fuckface?
text: This from the Shorter Man, who is clearly not happy.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: I'm asshole. He's fuckface.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: Jake, apprise Rodney Dangerfield
dialog: here of his situation.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles.
text: Steps up and delivers a looping right to Hallenbeck's
text: face. A sickening crunch. A two inch gash streams blood.
text: Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his gun.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: Perhaps we can dispense with the
dialog: fun and games now, yes?
text: Jimmy rushes forward, snarling. The Beretta swivels.
text: Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Easy... Jim... All they want is
dialog: the evidence...
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: The evidence. Very smart. See,
dialog: Jake, he knows when a situation is
text: untenable.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You like that word?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Great word.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: It occurs to me that you may have
text: the evidence in question.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (spits out blood)
dialog: Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing
dialog: with geniuses.
text: Another fist to the head. Hallenbeck grunts. Spits more
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Leave him alone, you fuck!
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
text: Back off, Jimmy.
text: The Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: Leave him alone...?
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Whatever you say. Jake?
text: The Short Man steps away from Hallenbeck. Turns and
text: launches a kick at Jimmy's groin. Connects. The kid
text: drops to the ground, retching.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Ah, my young friend... I neglected
dialog: to tell you that Jake attacks his
dialog: job with a certain... exuberance.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Christ... I'm being beat up by the
dialog: inventor of Scrabble.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
text: He's still in a good mood, Jake.
text: Kick him again.
text: Jake steps forward.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Wait!
text: Hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You want the fucking evidence that
dialog: the stripper had. I've got it.
dialog: So we can play games, or I can
dialog: hand it over.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And then you'll let us go, right?
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: Sure. We'll let you go.
dialog: (to Hallenbeck)
dialog: Where is it?
text: Hallenbeck meets the Tall Man's gaze. Speaks softly.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Hand me the car keys, Jimmy.
text: Jimmy stumbles to his feet. Looks at the Tall Man.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
text: Walk over and hand him the keys.
dialog: Slow and easy.
text: Jimmy takes out the car keys. Crosses to Hallenbeck.
text: Gives him the keys.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
text: The evidence is in the trunk.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: Open it. Slow.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Hallenbeck smiles. Shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I don't think so.
text: He turns and throws the keys as far as he can.
text: They fall out of sight behind a cottage.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Oops. I guess nobody gets it.
speaker_heading: TALL MAN
dialog: You dumb bastard, you're going to
dialog: pay for that. Jake, open the
dialog: trunk.
text: Jake steps forward, drawing a .38 silenced pistol.
text: He is going to shoot open the lock.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HALLENBECK
text: This is what he's been waiting for. He tenses, looking
text: to one side: next to him is a sloping hillside, angling
text: down and away. He grips Jimmy's wrist, signalling to get
dialog: ready.
text: Jake raises the PISTOL. Take aim at the lock and FIRES.
text: The SHOT is SILENCED. What follows is not.
text: Because the bullet blows through the trunk --
text: And hits three sticks of live dynamite.
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: Hallenbeck is already moving, pitching to one side,
text: throwing himself and Jimmy down the hillside.
text: The night lights up like a SUNBURST.
text: A tower of fire...
text: Climbs up and outward from the car.
text: The TRUNK LID is BLOWN fifty feet in the air.
text: The tires are pulped.
text: GLASS SPRAYS for fifty yards in every direction.
text: And, most importantly: both hitmen are engulfed in
dialog: flame.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: SOUND. Fury.
text: Flames, rolling skyward.
text: TINKLE of raining GLASS.
text: Bits of falling metal.
text: All in all, a helluva blast, and meanwhile:
speaker_heading: JIMMY AND JOE
text: continue to careen down the hillside.
text: Bouncing like rag puppets. Out of control.
text: Lurch to stop at the bottom.
text: Covered head to toe with dirt. Bruised. Bloody.
dialog: Alive.
text: They lie side by side, sucking air --
text: Until they both hear an odd noise:
text: The sound of CRUMPLING METAL.
text: The sound is GETTING LOUDER.
text: They both crane their necks in time to see --
text: The flaming car, tumbling end over end
text: Coming down the hill.
text: Heading straight for them.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Jesus fucking Christ!
text: They both dive for cover, out of the way.
dialog: Barely make it.
text: The CAR plows past them in a shower of dirt.
text: CRUMPLING. Heaving. Spitting fire.
text: Finally SLAMS to a halt against a palm tree.
dialog: Burns.
text: The night is filled with SHOUTS and CURSES.
text: The sound of DOORS OPENING. The crackle of flames.
speaker_heading: ON GROUND
text: Joe rolls over. Looks at Jimmy. Jimmy looks at Joe.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You alive?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Don't know yet.
text: They crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The dynamite?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Either that, or we're looking at
text: a major factory recall.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Dead guys... don't make bad jokes,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: So we're alive.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Yeah. Hooray.
text: He spits blood as SIRENS once more fill the night air,
text: APPROACHING.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Go. Get out of here.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Get the fuck out of here, I'll
dialog: take the heat on this one. Rent
dialog: a car. Then go home and wait for
dialog: my call. Do it.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. L.A.P.D. ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BESSALO
dialog: Goddammit, this is a police matter,
dialog: you son of a bitch! I'm sick and
dialog: fucking tired of sweeping up your
text: dead bodies, Joe, and the next time
dialog: I see your ugly mug I'm puttin' a

text: Hallenbeck stares at him. Blows smoke. Says nothing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT
text: Jimmy's at the wheel of a rented Subaru. Hallenbeck
text: beside him. He hands Joe the envelope he found in Cory's
dialog: apartment.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: If you thought there was dynamite
dialog: in the trunk, wait'll you see this.
text: Hallenbeck reaches into the envelope and extracts a
text: photograph: Two men having lunch together on a secluded
dialog: patio.
text: Both are older, distinguished-looking.
text: Joe suddenly looks very pale.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: The guy on the left is Connie
dialog: Marcon, the owner of the L.A.
dialog: Stallions.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Forget about him. Look at the
text: guy on the right.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sort of familiar. Who is he?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Senator Calvin Baynard.
text: Jimmy draws a sharp breath. Pause, then:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Let's go back to the cops. I'm
dialog: scared.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Take it easy, kid. It's not so
dialog: bad.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Not so bad. Excuse me, did you

dialog: You don't understand, Joe, see,
text: if a guy vomits on the sidewalk,
dialog: you don't say, 'Oh, hey, it's not
dialog: so bad, there's some ham in there.'
dialog: It's fucking vomit, okay? This is
dialog: bad.
text: Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette.
text: Stares straight ahead through the windshield. Begins to
dialog: talk:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: When I was thirty, I was on the
dialog: President's personal security
dialog: force. Once night I was on the
dialog: way home from a late session. I'm
text: on the highway just outside of
dialog: Georgetown when I see something
text: up ahead.
speaker_heading: MEMORY FLASH
dialog: Another time. Another night.
text: A younger-looking Hallenbeck.
text: Rugged features. Clipped military haircut.
text: He is driving.
text: Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist.
text: Up ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog:
speaker_heading: WRECKED CAR
text: is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass.
text: He SCREECHES to a stop.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: In a dream-like SLOW MOTION, he approaches the overturned
dialog: car.
text: There are two dead bodies inside.
text: A woman. A little boy.
text: In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with

text: splattered with blood.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK (V.O.)
text: It was a high-speed collision.

text: and the boy were dead. The driver
text: of the other car wasn't.
scene_heading: STAGGERING DRUNK
text: is weaving toward Hallenbeck.
text: Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes.
text: He wears an $800 suit. Tan Cordovan loafers. Silk tie.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: Fuckin' bitch... She got in front
dialog: of me, man. Shit. My fuckin' car.
dialog: Stupid bitch wrecked my car...

speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: Do you know who I am...? I'm

dialog: Calvin D. Baynard, man. Call my
dialog: father, he'll take care of it.
text: The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck.
text: Clutching at Joe's lapels. Wheezing liquor fumes.
text: He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joe's hand.
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: You'll tell 'em what happened,
text: right...? Bitch swerved in front
dialog: of me, man. Wrecked my fuckin'
dialog: Mercedes. Right...?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK (V.O.)
dialog: I could smell bourbon on him, big
text: time. He was standing there, not
text: a scratch on him. I went a little
dialog: nuts. I hit him.
text: In SLOW MOTION, Hallenbeck backhands the rich drunk,
text: with a head-snapping impact that bursts lips. Breaks
dialog: teeth.
text: We see the Drunk's head slowly strike the asphalt.
text: A sickening concussion.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: The blow was non-lethal. But when

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

scene_heading: SNAP BACK TO:
scene_heading: JIMMY AND JOE - BACK TO PRESENT
dialog: Driving.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Even when he came out of it, he
dialog: was never right in the head. His
dialog: dad fixed everything with the cops.
text: The accident report disappeared. A
dialog: week later the police found half a
dialog: kilo of crack cocaine planted in
dialog: my house. Acting on an anonymous
dialog: tip.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The senator fucked your job.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: And my pension. And my marriage.
dialog: Only reason I'm still licensed to
text: carry a gun, the man himself made
dialog: a few calls. Since then I'm just
text: playing it out. Day by day.
text: Jimmy is silent for a moment. Then:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Cory tumbled to some sort of deal
dialog: between Marcon and the senator,
dialog: and they had her killed.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We gotta show this photo to the

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Not yet. I need more evidence.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want Baynard, Jimmy. I want to
dialog: bring him down. I could use your
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Why should I help you?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: DARIAN

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: DARIAN

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's you?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

dialog: Why do people cheat, Joe?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Ooooooh. Very deep.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: So deep I don't know what the fuck
dialog: it means.
speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY

dialog: Died before he woke up.

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

dialog: you see?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Why did he have to die?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (softly)

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I'm gonna borrow your shower.

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

text: The door opens.
text: Hallenbeck is standing there with a handful of fresh
text: towels. He stops. Staring at Jimmy. They freeze in

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: And then I lose my job, my fucking

text: He advances on Joe, trembling with anger.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Why, Joe? Why is there an injury

dialog: ... those fucking hypocrites...
dialog: killed the last thing I could do,

dialog: small...

speaker_heading: BESSALO
dialog: You wanna bet?

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 91.
scene_heading: JOE HALLENBECK'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE
text: Weathered. Sallow. Dark circles under the eyes.
speaker_heading: HAND
text: comes INTO FRAME and slaps him. Hard.
text: Rocks his head to one side.
scene_heading: INT. ELEGANT BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Thick carpet. Polished, wood furniture. Window walls.
text: Outside, the sea is angry and grey.
speaker_heading: PABLO AND CHET
text: are standing over Hallenbeck, who is slumped in a chair.
text: Both hitmen wear holstered sidearms.
text: Chet leans over and slaps Hallenbeck again.
text: The big detective begins to stir.
text: His eyelids flutter.
speaker_heading: CHET
text: I think he's awake.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Make sure.
text: Chet's hand flashes out for a third slap --
text: And from nowhere, Joe Hallenbeck's hand magically
text: appears.
text: Intercepts the blow.
text: Clamps onto Chet's hand and wrenches it.
text: A cry of pain.
text: Chet stumbles backward, cradling the wrist.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I'm awake.
text: His eyelids creak open.
text: He squints, adjusting to the light.
text: Studies his captors.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: You nearly broke my wrist, man.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Life's a bitch.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He starts pawing his coat pockets, looking for a cigarette.
text: In the corner, Pablo chuckles:
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Milo warned us to watch out for
dialog: this guy.
text: Chet is seething. He glares at Hallenbeck.
text: Hallenbeck yawns.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Fuck that. Look at him. He's
dialog: nothin'. Guy's a piece of shit.
text: Hallenbeck ignores him. Sits up. Rubs tired eyes.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Anybody got a cigarette...?
text: Chet steps forward. Grins wickedly.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Sure, buddy. I got a cigarette.
text: He reaches into his shirt pocket. Extracts a Marlboro.
text: Hands it to Hallenbeck. Takes out a lighter.
text: Hallenbeck places the cigarette between his lips.
dialog: Leans forward for a light --
text: And Chet slugs him in the face.
text: The cigarette goes flying.
text: Hallenbeck's head snaps back.
text: Blood creeps from his lower lip.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (guffaws)
dialog: Hey, baby, I thought you were
dialog: tough. See, Pablo, he ain't so
dialog: bad.
text: Hallenbeck's eyes glint fiercely. He takes a breath.
dialog: Leans forward and says:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I seem to have dropped my
dialog: cigarette. May I have another?
text: Chet turns, meets his gaze. The grin falters a bit.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: (unnerved)
dialog: Sure. Sure thing, buddy.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He hands Hallenbeck another smoke.
text: Hallenbeck puts it between his lips.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I need a light.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And if you touch me again... I'll
dialog: kill you.
text: A pregnant pause.
text: The challenge hangs in the air.
text: Slowly, Chet takes the lighter from his pocket.
text: Pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features.
text: Hallenbeck leans forward for a light.
text: Chet extends his arm --
text: And slugs Hallenbeck in the face again.
text: Rocks him.
text: Chet howls with laughter.
text: Pablo grins.
speaker_heading: CHET
dialog: Baby! Two for two!
text: The laughter continues.
text: Hallenbeck takes a deep breath.
text: Stands up.
text: Strikes with a flattened palm.
text: Breaks Chet's nose.
text: Drives it up into the brain.
text: Chet stands, pole-axed. Blinks once.
text: Pitches over dead.
text: And suddenly Pablo isn't laughing.
text: He stares at Hallenbeck, incredulous.
text: Stares at Chet, lying on the carpet.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Jesus Christ.
dialog: (draws his gun)
dialog: You son-of-a-bitch. Jesus Christ!!
text: He rushes to Chet. Kneels beside him.
text: Hallenbeck calmly returns to his seat.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: You killed him! 'Fuckin' A, you
dialog: killed him, he's fuckin' dead!!!
text: Hallenbeck says nothing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: At that moment, a door opens, and Milo enters.
text: Slick. Well-dressed. Utterly composed.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Is there a problem?
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: (still dazed)
dialog: He killed Chet, Milo. The mother-
dialog: fucker just killed him!
text: Milo looks toward Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck says nothing.
text: Instead, he calmly leans forward and picks up Chet's
text: lighter from the carpet. Lights his cigarette. Blows
dialog: smoke.
text: A tense moment... and then Milo does something un-
text: expected: He starts to laugh. Advances into the room,
text: chuckling.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Oh, my. Oh, Goddamn. Joseph,
dialog: Joseph, you don't disappoint me.
text: He draws a Walther PPK and approaches Hallenbeck.
text: Smiling and cheerful.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You seem to have killed one of
dialog: my men.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I needed a light.
text: Milo nods as if this makes perfect sense.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You took an awful risk. Pablo
dialog: here could have shot you dead.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: If you wanted me dead, you'd have
dialog: already killed me.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Yes, that's true.
dialog: (sits down)
dialog: I suppose introductions are in
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (waves his hand)
dialog: Fuck it. You're the bad guy,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Yes. I'm the bad guy.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: And you've got the gun, and I'm
dialog: supposed to tremble in fear,
dialog: something like that?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Fine. I'll start trembling in a
dialog: minute. Mind if I have a drink
dialog: first?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I don't see why not. Pablo,
dialog: please take Chet's corpse into
text: the other room, and then fix Mr.
text: Hallenbeck a drink.
text: Suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway:
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Make that two.
text: Hallenbeck turns toward the new arrival.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Hey, look who's here. Connie
dialog: Marcon himself.
text: Sure enough, CONRAD MARCON saunters in, just like he owns
text: the place. Which, by the way, he does. Tall, strong,
text: Texas-tough. Dressed in a Saville Row suit. He frowns
dialog: at Hallenbeck:
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Careful, son. Only my friends
dialog: call me Connie.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You got friends? When did this
dialog: happen?
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: I'll give you one thing. You're
dialog: pretty calm for a man in your
dialog: position.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You're pretty calm for a man whose
dialog: team is three and six on the year.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: They're having some problems.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: They stink.
text: Marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: I'm glad you're here, Joe. We
dialog: got a few things to discuss.
text: He takes a moment to gather his thoughts.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: For starters, I'm sure you're
dialog: aware that professional football
dialog: is changing, and not for better.
dialog: (lights a cigar)
dialog: Used to be, you went to the local
dialog: stadium come Sunday, you saw
dialog: heroes. Guys who fought for
dialog: their hometown. Anymore, no one
dialog: gives a shit. Ever since Sonny
dialog: Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe
dialog: Namath back in '66, the sons of
dialog: bitches just got greedier.
dialog: Playing only for themselves.
text: Giving nothing back to the game.
text: Pablo hands him a double bourbon.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: This year, the final blow: the
dialog: N.F.L. votes to decertify the
dialog: Players Organization. Eliminates
dialog: the draft, reduces all athletes
dialog: to free agents. Reduces football,
dialog: once and for all, to commerce. To
dialog: greed, you follow?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: When do I say the Pledge of
dialog: Allegiance?
text: Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Do you know how many ratings points
dialog: Monday Night Football lost this
dialog: year? Per week? An average of
dialog: two point eight.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Oh, for Chrissake. You're telling
dialog: me this whole thing is about TV
dialog: ratings?
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: People have stopped watching, Joe!
dialog: Everybody's turning the channel,
dialog: they're still looking for heroes,
dialog: you follow? Guys like you. Milo
dialog: here tells me you took a bullet
dialog: for the President, jumped in front
text: of a sniper rifle.
text: Hallenbeck reacts, startled. Looks at Milo.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: We took the liberty of researching
dialog: your background.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: How about it, Joe? Is it truth or
dialog: hype?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I got the rifle in my closet as a
dialog: souvenir.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: There you go, that's what I'm
dialog: saying. The public wants real
dialog: heroes. Not a bunch of football
text: prima donnas, jumping from team
dialog: to team with their fancy lawyers.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: In fact, Joe, and this is my
dialog: point, there's only one reason
dialog: left nowadays to watch pro-
dialog: football. Can you guess?
text: It begins to dawn on Hallenbeck.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
text: Gambling.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Exactly. Gambling.
dialog: (puffs his cigar)
dialog: Just one problem: football
dialog: gambling is illegal in all but
dialog: two of the fifty states. And
dialog: that, Joe boy, is where I come in.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (sudden realization)
dialog: Shit, that's what this is about!
dialog: You're bribing United States
dialog: senators. Paying them to pass
dialog: legislation --
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: -- Legalizing football gambling
dialog: in all fifty states. Exactly.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
text: Attendance goes up again. TV
text: ratings go up again.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: You got it, son. The networks are
dialog: happy. I'm happy. Everybody's
dialog: happy.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Before we get too fucking happy,
dialog: let's get a couple things straight:
dialog: first, I'm not your fucking son,
dialog: and second... why am I still alive?
text: Marcon stops pacing. Sighs and sits down facing
dialog: Hallenbeck.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: It's like this, Joe: everything
dialog: was going great until a couple
dialog: weeks ago, and then I hit a snag:
dialog: Senator Calvin Baynard.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (takes a sip of bourbon)
dialog: I don't get it. What's the snag?
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: I offered him the bribe and he
dialog: wouldn't take it.
text: Hallenbeck actually does a spit-take. Sprays bourbon.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLEBECK
dialog: Baynard? Are you nuts? The guy's
text: so crooked he shits slinkies.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Allow me to clarify: I offered
dialog: him the bribe, and he turned it
dialog: down because he wanted more money.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (sighs with relief)
dialog: Thank God. For a minute there I
dialog: felt hell freezing over. Did he
dialog: ask for more than a million?
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Does the Pope shit in the woods?
dialog: He wants two million or he'll
dialog: blow the lid off my whole plan.
dialog: I don't feel like paying no two
dialog: mil, so basically that good ole'
dialog: boy's gotta die.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Taking off a U.S. senator, that's
dialog: pretty ballsy. Even for an asshole
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Oh, I'm not going to kill Baynard,
dialog: Joe.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Who is?
text: Marcon says nothing. Just looks at Hallenbeck and
text: smiles.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Oh, shit.
text: He rubs tired eyes.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I'm the perfect fall guy. Everyone
dialog: and his uncle Max knows I hate
dialog: Baynard.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Anything goes wrong, all the heat
dialog: lands on you, Joe boy. My hands
dialog: are clean.
text: Hallenbeck scowls.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Any particular reason I should go
dialog: along with this prize-winning
dialog: scheme?
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Just one.
text: He motions to Milo, who disappears through a doorway.
text: Reappears a moment later.
dialog: He's got Joe's wife.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HALLENBECK
text: He stands. Face contorting. Fists clenched.
text: Rage courses through him like an electric current.
text: Marcon cocks his gun.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Sit down, Joe.
text: A moment. Joe stands, smouldering. On fire. Sarah
dialog: speaks:
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Do what he says, Joe.
text: Joe sits. Breathing shallowly.
text: Eyes locked on Milo.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Are you alright, Sarah?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: That's a temporary condition,
dialog: Joseph. As you may be aware,
dialog: there are distributors in Mexico
text: who positively crave snuff films.
dialog: And unless you do every fucking
dialog: thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your
dialog: wife will make her motion picture
dialog: debut.
text: He meets Joe's murderous gaze... and smiles.
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
text: Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Jimmy is seated, shirtless,
text: on a metal examining table. His ribs are taped. His
text: arm in a cast.
text: Two men loom over him, sour expressions on their faces:
text: Sergeants McCaskey and Bessalo.
text: Jimmy shakes his head, exasperated:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Look, I'll say it again for the
dialog: cheap seats: I don't know
dialog: anything and I can't help you.
dialog: Okay? Can I go now?
text: Bessalo grimaces in disgust.
speaker_heading: BESSALO
dialog: Let me get this straight: you're
dialog: walking along, minding your own
dialog: business, when two guys you never
dialog: met jump you and throw you in a
dialog: ditch for no particular reason.
dialog: Is that it?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: BESSALO
dialog: You're full of shit, kid.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Tell me where Hallenbeck is.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: How the fuck should I know? Try
dialog: his house.
speaker_heading: BESSALO
dialog: We did. Where is he?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: For Chrissake, I just met the guy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look, Sergeant. I don't give a
dialog: shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just
dialog: busted my throwing arm and I'm
dialog: in a real pissy mood, so you got
dialog: two choices: either charge me
dialog: with something or let me the fuck
dialog: outta here.
text: He glares defiantly at Bessalo.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: EXT. CASA LOMA APARTMENTS - DAY
text: The grey day wears on.
text: Jimmy trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment
text: unit. Pulls up short, staring ahead --
speaker_heading: DARIAN HALLENBECK
text: Slumped outside the door to his apartment. Asleep. A
text: crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand.
text: He kneels beside her. Touches her shoulder.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hey. Wake up.
text: She stirs. Awakens, looking at him.
text: Her eyes are puffy and red from crying.
text: Her hair is a tangled mess.
text: She hands him the piece of paper, and promptly bursts
text: into tears.
text: Buries her head in his chest, sobbing.
text: He cradles her with his good arm.
text: Awkwardly unfolds the crumpled paper and reads:
text: MOMMY AND DADDY ARE WITH US
text: CALL THE POLICE AND WE'LL KILL THEM BOTH.
text: He stares at the note, dumbstruck.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY

speaker_heading: PABLO

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: They are seated on the dock.

text: Pablo kneels and unfastens Joe's cuffs.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Get up.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Go fuck yourself.
text: Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbeck's ribs.
text: Hallenbeck gasps in pain.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I meant that... in a good way...
text: Pablo hauls him to his feet. Props him against the
dialog: railing.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Time for a little payback, Joe.
dialog: Call it a service to dear departed
dialog: Chet.
text: He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle.
text: Sarah cries out in alarm.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: How's that feel, fuckhead?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: I'm asshole... she's fuckhead.
text: And with that, Pablo lets him have it.
text: Rains punches on his chest and gut.
text: Slams an elbow into his kidneys.
text: Drives a knee into his groin.
text: Joe hits the deck.
text: Milo calls out from the boat:
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Easy, Pablo. I want him conscious.
text: Pablo is kicking Joe's prone form.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Goddamn you, stop it!! Oh, Jesus,
dialog: leave him alone!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Pablo gives Joe a last swift kick. Spits on him.
text: Hallenbeck vomits. Lies bleeding on the dock.

text: allow. Cradles his head in her lap.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Don't... look at me...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here,
dialog: it's okay.
dialog: (strokes his hair)

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

dialog: puke all over myself... and now
dialog: you love me?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I never stopped loving you, Joe.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Christ, you slept with three guys.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You knew about the others?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I knew.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You never said anything.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Figured... you needed them.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you
dialog: say something?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Like what? 'Fuck you, Sarah'?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything
dialog: to show that you... that you had
dialog: some pride left.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Sorry... I'm fresh out.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Must be my trick ear. Sounded
dialog: like you said, 'Get me out of
dialog: this.'
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You can take these guys, Joe.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I've got cracked ribs and a
dialog: concussion.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Save me, Joe. Be a hero.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I don't believe in heroes.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That's no excuse.

dialog: lips:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Fuck you, Sarah...
text: And he smiles.
text: Just then, Milo signals from the boat.
text: Seeing, this, Pablo approaches the couple again.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: All right, lovebirds, break it up.
text: He yanks Sarah to her feet.
text: Lets his gaze roam up and down her body.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Nice tits.
text: He rips open her blouse. Roughly fondles her breasts.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Stay down, fucker. Don't you
dialog: move.
text: At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock.

speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Careful, Pablo. We don't want to
dialog: get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in
text: front of hubby.
text: He squats next to Joe.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time
dialog: to go, and remember: you follow
dialog: orders, or the missus pays the
dialog: price.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You're gonna kill us both anyway.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Perhaps. But there are ways to
dialog: die, and then there are... ways to
dialog: die. Capisce? You determine your
dialog: wife's fate.
text: He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet.
text: Propels him toward the boat.
text: As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out:
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Joe...!
text: He stops. Turns. Looks at her.
text: Boys and girls, there is, within Joe Hallenbeck, a spark:
text: Tiny. Fizzling. Almost gone.
text: But now, looking at his wife, that spark unexpectedly
dialog: kindles --
text: And eight years melt away.
dialog: Just like that.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: If you touch me again... I'll kill

speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Christ, Milo, how come you always

speaker_heading: MILO

speaker_heading: MARCON

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: Is that gonna work?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Beats me, but I think it's what

scene_heading: INT. OPULENT LIVING ROOM - PARTY

scene_heading: SENATOR CALVIN BAYNARD

speaker_heading: MILO

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: My, my. Little testy this evening.

speaker_heading: MILO

text: Hallenbeck says nothing.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: What would you do, Joseph, if

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Come again?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You're so cool, aren't you? So...

speaker_heading: MILO

dialog: Goes below.
text: Grabs a tuxedo from the closet.

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: DARIAN

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: MILO

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MILO

scene_heading: HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS
text: Twenty thousand of them, to be precise. Neatly bundled.
speaker_heading: MILO
text: Then we pull a simple switch.
text: When the man returns to his boat,
dialog: he's carrying this suitcase.
text: He points to the identical twin.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Plastics?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Detonation upon opening. Enough
dialog: to kill the passengers, not enough
dialog: to sink the craft.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: And when we place your charred
text: corpse amidst the wreckage, the
dialog: police will draw the inevitable
dialog: conclusion: a down-on-his-luck
text: P.I. makes a suicide strike
dialog: against the man who cost a
dialog: career.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: That sounds lovely, but how is my
dialog: body gonna get charred?
text: With a flourish, Milo pulls aside a tablecloth.
text: Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Maybe I'll get to hear you scream,
dialog: after all...
text: Just then, one of Milo's crew sticks his head in the

speaker_heading: FISHING BOAT

speaker_heading: FISHERMAN

text: Milo's crewman steps up to the rail. Speaks urgently:
speaker_heading: CREW MEMBER
dialog: Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast

speaker_heading: AIDE

speaker_heading: AIDE

speaker_heading: CREWMAN (O.S.)
dialog: There's a little girl with him!
text: With that, he goes berserk.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Works his bound hands over his knees so they're now tied

text: Worms beneath the table... awkward, desperate...
text: Drags out the can of gasoline.
text: Tries to unscrew the top. No dice. Can't get a grip.
text: Finally, in frustration, he tips the can on its side.

text: Over and over until, with a metallic pop -- ! it bursts.
text: Floods gasoline over the carpet, meanwhile:
speaker_heading: BACK TOPSIDE

speaker_heading: WITH JIMMY

dialog: and meanwhile:
scene_heading: INT. YACHT CABIN

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

text: Until the ropes binding his legs snap.
text: He lurches to his feet, lets free.
text: Now there's only one problem: He's on fire.
text: The legs of his pants are soaked with gas.

speaker_heading: CREWMAN

dialog: Third and long, baby, lets' go...
dialog: And, sure, his left arm isn't his good arm --
dialog: But, boy, does he heave that anchor.
text: It soars through space, chain playing out behind it...
text: Hits water, thirty yards past Hallenbeck --
text: Who turns, sees the anchor skimming toward him over the
dialog: waves.
scene_heading: EXT. MILO'S YACHT
text: Milo, meanwhile, has also spotted Hallenbeck.
text: He growls in rage. Hefts the Ingram machine gun, as:
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around
dialog: the passing anchor and whoosh -- !
text: He is catapulted forward, jerked like a rag puppet.
text: BULLETS CHOP the water where he just was.
text: He skims over the waves. Bounced. Battered.
text: Trailing behind Jimmy at fifty miles an hour.
text: Jimmy and Darian begin to haul him in.
text: Struggling. Straining.
text: The boat rushing headlong, driverless.
text: With a last, desperate surge of energy --
text: They drag Hallenbeck over the side. Into the boat.
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: Dad...!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She collapses, weeping, atop her father.
text: Hugs him for all she's worth.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: What the hell's she doing here??
speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: I stowed away...
text: GUNFIRE splits the air.
text: Reminds them they're not out of the woods.
speaker_heading: MILO'S YACHT
text: is behind them again. The fire is out. The chase is on.
text: It steadily cuts the distance.
speaker_heading: JIMMY'S BOAT
text: Hallenbeck staggers to his feet.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Get below, Darian. And stay
dialog: there.
text: He stumbles into the wheelhouse. Dazed. Barely
text: conscious.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Got any ideas?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Yeah. Go really fast and hope
dialog: they don't catch us.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh, shit.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
text: Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on.
dialog: Into the fog they go, and, folks --
dialog: This is really scary.
text: Because you can't see a foot in front of your face.
text: They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour.
text: Hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: And then a shape materializes off to port:
text: Milo's yacht.
text: Running alongside. Drawing closer.
text: Hallenbeck wrestles the wheel. No dice.
text: The yacht draws ever closer... men on deck... machine
dialog: guns...
text: Joe looks over... and his face tells the story:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: We're dead.
text: Except, just then, a strange thing happens:
text: Milo's yacht veers off to the left. Away from
text: Hallenbeck. Jimmy stares, dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What the fuck? They're peeling
dialog: off. Why?
text: A pause... then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: 'Cause they got sonar, that's why!
dialog: Hard to port!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Port?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Left, Goddammit.
text: The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog --
text: The Catalina ferry looms right in front of them.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Shit fuck piss!
dialog: They almost make it.
text: As it is, they avoid a head-on. Instead, they hit
text: broadside.
text: A sickening CRUNCH -- !
text: Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet.
text: A momentary glimpse of faces rushing past -- Horrified
text: tourists -- And then the ferry is behind them.
text: Jimmy gets up. Staggers to the controls.
text: Pushes the throttle. The boat lurches forward --
text: Then SPUTTERS. Fizzles.
text: He swears violently.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 131.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: We're on half power, we lost an
dialog: engine!
scene_heading: EXT. FOG BANK - SAME TIME
text: The crippled boat chugs through the mist.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: swears again. Bangs his fist.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: We're sitting ducks. They got
dialog: sonar. They can find us.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Kill the running lights and radio
dialog: the Coast Guard.
text: Jimmy flicks off the lights. Grabs the mike. As he
text: does, a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit, causing him
text: to pause... and then stare in shock as their boat emerges
dialog: from the fog --
text: And Air One hovers directly overhead.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Fuck me.
text: The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends,
text: the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Get down!
text: They both hit the floor. Hands over their heads --
text: And then the pilot makes a costly error:
text: He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht.
text: With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out
dialog: of the fog --
text: PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER.
text: Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it
text: to shreds.
dialog: Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix
text: erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. Turns night
dialog: into day.
dialog: 132.
speaker_heading: JIMMY AND JOE
text: are still huddled on the floor.
text: Pause. They look up. Bewildered.
text: There was a big light... Big noise...
dialog: Why aren't they dead?
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: They move like sleepwalkers to the cockpit window.
text: Stare in disbelief. Joe looks at Jimmy. Jimmy at Joe.
text: Debris rains down.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SITE - MINUTES LATER
text: Jimmy, Joe and Darian are on deck, chugging through the
text: wreckage. Darian clings to her father's arm, in shock.
text: Hallenbeck sees something in the distance. Squints:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: What's that?
text: Jimmy looks: A bright object... going in circles...
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: That's Baynard's boat!
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (nods)
dialog: It can get us to shore faster than
dialog: this one, don't you think?
text: He starts to turn away. Notices something in the water.
text: Speaks over his shoulder to Jimmy.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Hand me the pole.
text: Jimmy hands him a long, wooden pole with a hooked end.
text: He fishes in the water. Snares a large, floating object.
text: Swings it aboard. Drops it at Jimmy's feet.
dialog: The suitcase.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Birthday present.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 133.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He turns away. Jimmy bends to open the suitcase.
text: Joe heads into the cockpit, Darian beside him.
text: Steers the boat away from the crash site. Toward the
text: senator's boat. Chugs forward on half an engine.
text: O.S., Jimmy suddenly yells:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Holy fucking shit!!
scene_heading: EXT. BAYNARD'S BOAT - SAME TIME
text: The once-mighty Marlineer runs aimless circles in the
text: mist. Half the cockpit is blown away, probably by a LAWS
dialog: rocket.
text: The Hatteras pulls up alongside, and Hallenbeck steps to
text: the rail, carrying the Baretta.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Wait here.
text: He swings aboard the senator's boat.
text: Gun cocked. Ready.
scene_heading: INT. SENATOR'S BOAT - COCKPIT
text: Enters the cockpit. What's left of the roof is bullet-
text: pocked.
text: The navigator is dead. Slumped over the controls.
text: Joe pulls him off the panel. KILLS the ENGINE.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN
text: Joe bursts inside. Hard and fast. Gun leveled.
dialog: No need. It's a slaughterhouse.
text: The walls are perforated. Baynard and his men are dead.
text: The suitcase's evil twin lies unopened on the table.
text: Hallenbeck walks over to Baynard's lifeless body.
text: Stares into the wide-open eyes.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Sorry, Cal. Life in the big city.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LONG BEACH BOAT RENTALS - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. DOCK - SAME TIME
text: Hallenbeck crouches next to Darian, looks her in the eye.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Listen carefully. I'm gonna go
dialog: get your mom back, okay? You're
dialog: gonna go in the Denny's restaurant
dialog: and stay there. Talk to the
dialog: waitress but don't mention me.
dialog: Mom and I will come pick you up

speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: (crying)

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Are you kidding? I do this for a

scene_heading: INT. RENTAL SUBARU - DRIVING - NIGHT

text: In the back seat sits the coveted suitcase.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Your prints are all over that
text: boat. What happens when they find
dialog: the bodies inside?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Quit being a fuckin' killjoy.

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Come on. We've got some things to
dialog: pick up.
scene_heading: EXT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE (WEST L.A.) - NIGHT

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 135.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Across the street, Hallenbeck's house is dark. Deserted.
text: Truly a sight: Jimmy, in a white shirt and tuxedo pants,
text: nursing a broken arm; and Joe, drenched to the skin,
text: pants hanging in scorched tatters.
text: Joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand. They stop.
text: Crouched behind a eucalyptus tree. Joe points:
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: A late-model Buick is parked just up the street from his
dialog: house...
text: There is a man slouched inside. Smoking.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
text: Shit. Someone's staking me out.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (clears his throat)

dialog: Miller.
text: Hallenbeck shoots him a withering look.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COASTAL WATERS - NIGHT
text: A Coast Guard cutter is circling the site of the boat/

text: dark waters.
speaker_heading: ENSIGN
dialog: I think I got someone! Four
dialog: o'clock!
speaker_heading: MILO
text: is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage.
text: Half his hair is burned away. His face is blistered.
text: He looks up, pleading, at the Ensign, as:
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: He hides the Ingram beneath his body, cocked and ready.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 136.
scene_heading: INT. PARKED BUICK - NIGHT
text: The sour stakeout cop reaches for a job necessity: the
text: pot to piss in. He undoes his fly. Pees into an old
text: Maxwell House coffee can.
text: Opens the door to dump it out.
text: A hand reaches in, lightning quick.
text: Grabs the can, throws it back in his face.
text: As he jerks backward, blinded, the hand knocks him cold.
scene_heading: EXT. BUICK - SAME TIME
text: Hallenbeck drags the unconscious cop from the car.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Let's get him inside and tie him
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Are you crazy? That's a cop! You
dialog: don't punch cops!
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I forgot. Hurry up.
scene_heading: INT. HALLENBECK'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: The cop is bound and gagged in the corner. Unconscious.
text: Hallenbeck moves hurriedly. Not a second to waste.
text: Pulls a dark turtleneck from a drawer.
text: Rips off the sleeve. Throws it to Jimmy.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Wear that.
text: He strips off his own shirt. Crosses to the closet.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You know how to use a gun?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: The trigger's the little black
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Here.

dialog: cylinders.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 137.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Use these. They're shredders.
text: Equipped with an explosive charge.
dialog: When you fire the gun, they spray
dialog: on impact. Take out anything
text: within ten yards.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: What are you gonna use?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: A little souvenir...
text: He reaches into the closet. Pulls out a sniper rifle.
text: The rifle. The one responsible for the puckered scar on
text: his chest.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Go bring the car around.
scene_heading: EXT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: Jimmy emerges, starts across the lawn.
text: Pulls up short. Stares ahead at:
scene_heading: HIS POV - TWO BLACK SEDANS
text: parked at the curb.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: He starts to cry out --
text: And a dark figure looms behind him.
text: Clubs him in the head.
scene_heading: INT. HALLENBECK'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
text: Hallenbeck snaps a full magazine into the rifle.
text: Stuffs extras into a black Windbreaker.
text: Hears a NOISE. Looks up, expecting Jimmy --
text: Draws a sharp breath:
scene_heading: PABLO AND ASSORTED GOONS
text: standing in the doorway. All of them have guns.
text: Pablo grins, shakes his head:
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Face it, pal. You're fucked by
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 138.
speaker_heading: PAD AND PAPER
text: as they're placed in front of Hallenbeck.
text: He is seated on the bed. Three guns covering him.
text: Beside him sits Furry Tom, grinning his stuffed-toy grin.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Are you a literate man, Joe?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I got a subscription to Jugs
dialog: magazine.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: That's good. See, Joe, what
dialog: you're gonna do, you're gonna
dialog: write a little story.
text: A GOON sticks his head in the door.
speaker_heading: GOON
dialog: We've got Jimmy Dix in the trunk.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Get him out of here. Take him to
dialog: Mr. Marcon. I'll follow you as
dialog: soon as my business here is
dialog: finished.
text: The Goon departs, leaving Hallenbeck with Pablo and two
text: others. He studies them. Calculates the odds. Verdict:
dialog: Bad.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Yeah, you're gonna write a little
dialog: story, Joe. About how guilt-
dialog: stricken you are over Senator
dialog: Baynard's death, which is all
text: over the air waves, by the way.
dialog: Yeah... you're so guilty about
dialog: paying those hitmen to kill him,
dialog: that you're gonna kill yourself.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Hey, who's writing this story?
dialog: You're doing all the good parts.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Oh, and, Joe...? Don't forget to
dialog: include how guilty you are over
dialog: that cop you murdered.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: What cop?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 139.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Pablo draws his pistol.
text: PUMPS TWO SHOTS into the unconscious cop in the corner.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: That one.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You son of a bitch...!
text: Pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it.
text: He is fueling Joe Hallenbeck's rage.
dialog: Pity the fool.
text: Hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes.
text: A thoroughly unnerving stare.
text: Then Joe does something very odd.
text: He says, softly:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: We don't like Pablo very much, do
dialog: we, Furry Tom...?
text: There is a pause... And then, incredibly -- Furry Tom
text: answers. A high-pitched, squeaky stuffed cat voice.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (as Furry Tom)
dialog: No, Mr. Hallenbeck, we think Pablo
dialog: is a motherless fuck who takes it
dialog: up the ass.
text: Dead silence. Pablo is completely thrown; so are we, for
dialog: that matter... and then it hits us: Joe is doing ven-
dialog: triloquism.
dialog: And the funny thing is, he's really good.
text: Pablo overcomes his shock.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: Shit, is he doing that?
text: Hallenbeck's face remains cold. Expressionless.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Furry Tom, tell Pablo what I'm
dialog: gonna do to him.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (as Furry Tom)
dialog: You're gong to make Pablo eat all
text: his teeth, Mr. Hallenbeck.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 140.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Pablo can't help it. He bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: PABLO
dialog: That's amazing, man!
text: Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom. Inserts his hand, makes
text: the furry head bob back and forth.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (as Furry Tom)
dialog: Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're
dialog: laughin' at me. That's not very
dialog: nice.
text: By now, all three hoods are in hysterics.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Are you mad, Furry Tom?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (as Furry Tom)
dialog: I don't get mad. I get even.
text: And, with that, Furry Tom's mouth opens --
text: And EXPLODES, showering stuffing.
text: One of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half
text: his throat is gone...
text: And Furry Thomas BELCHES FIRE again, and the second goon
text: goes down in a spray of blood, and if you haven't guessed
dialog: already --
text: Joe has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas.
text: Pablo is a little sharper. A little quicker.
text: He dives forward, knocks the puppet from Joe's hand.
text: Joe drives upward, into Pablo's gut.
text: They reel across the room. Locked in combat.
text: Lamps topple. GLASS BREAKS.
text: Pablo slams Joe's head into the wall. Leaves a dent.
dialog: Does it again, a sickening impact...
text: Starts to strangle Joe --
dialog: And the truth is, Joe's not thirty anymore.
text: He's not going to make it. The world swims away.
text: Then, as if through a tunnel, Joe notices something
text: beside him... something hanging on the wall.
text: Fights to focus. Breath gone. Strength gone.
dialog: Identifies the object:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 141.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: His Presidential Medal of Valor.
dialog: Shiny medal. Shiny ribbon. His name...
text: It hits him quite suddenly:
text: The medal has sharp edges.
text: With the last of his strength, he plucks it from the
text: wall. Drives it into Pablo's throat.
text: The big man stumbles backward. Eyes wide. Gurgling.
text: He thrashes, the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely
text: from his gushing neck.
text: Drops to the dusty carpet. Dies.
text: Hallenbeck takes a deep breath. Eyes wide. Insane.
text: He is surrounded by corpses. He takes another deep
dialog: breath.
text: Picks up the sniper rifle.
text: Slings it over his shoulder.
text: Heads for the door.
scene_heading: INT. CONRAD MARCON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jimmy Dix is on the floor, and Marcon is kicking him

speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: You know I don't enjoy doin' this,
dialog: Jim.
text: Jimmy curls up in a fetal ball. Marcon paces, shaking
text: his head.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: I remember how much you hated the
dialog: pain... You got hooked on Demerol,
dialog: didn't you...? I'll make a deal
dialog: with you. Tell me who you talked

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: JIMMY

scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
text: Hallenbeck leaves the rented Subaru by the side of the
dialog: road.
text: He is dressed in combat black. Government issue.

text: Like an angel of death, he moves into the brush.
text: Heading down the canyon.
scene_heading: EXT. MARCON'S HOME - SAME TIME
text: An armed sentry patrols the grounds.

text: Drives the hunting knife into his back.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
text: Marcon stirs the fireplace logs, stoking the blaze.

speaker_heading: MARCON

speaker_heading: HARDGUY

text: With a soft SPIT of sound, his forehead blooms crimson.
text: He collapses, lifeless.
text: At his desk, Marcon whirls, stunned, as:
speaker_heading: JOE HALLENBECK
text: steps through the French doors behind him.
text: He resembles nothing human. A demon in black.
text: Eyes burning. Gun held loosely. An extension of his
dialog: arm.
text: Marcon reaches for the button to summon help.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Don't.
text: He jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly
text: crushing his larynx. Hisses:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin'
dialog: kill you. Where's my wife?
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: I... I don't remember, I...
text: Joe shoves on the gun. The barrel chokes him.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: My wife.

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: MARCON

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

text: The Strange Man chuckles.
speaker_heading: STRANGE MAN
dialog: Sorry, but that won't work. I

text: A pause. Once more, Joe calculates the odds. No dice.
text: He places the rifle on the desk.
speaker_heading: STRANGE MAN
dialog: Walk over there by your friend,
dialog: Joe.
text: Hallenbeck turns around... and, for once, his jaw drops.
text: He's looking at a man he never thought he'd see again. A
text: man who suffers from facial paralysis ever since his head
text: bounced off the Georgetown turnpike eight years ago.
dialog: 145.
scene_heading: LOUIS BAYNARD
text: Son of the late senator. The right side of his face

text: gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Well, Goddamn. How's the head,
dialog: Lou?
speaker_heading: BAYNARD (STRANGE MAN)
dialog: Aside from permanent facial

speaker_heading: BAYNARD

dialog: freely to that hooker.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: She wasn't a hooker, dickhead.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: He should know, Jimmy. With a

dialog: paying for it.
speaker_heading: BAYNARD
dialog: You can die fast or slow, so watch

text: Jimmy chimes in:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: We'd rather watch yours. It's

text: Marcon has had enough. He pounds his fist on the desk.
speaker_heading: MARCON

dialog: both!
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Any bright ideas, Joe?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: JIMMY

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: You know of course, Connie, that
dialog: you're a dead man.
text: Marcon holds up his hand.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Wait.
text: The gunmen lower their weapons.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Let's humor this asshole. What
dialog: are you talking about?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Nothing much, just that I made a
text: phone call from the boat on the
dialog: way in.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: You called the cops? Fuck it,
dialog: they can't prove a thing.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Oh, but I didn't call the cops. I
dialog: called the mob.
text: Marcon stares at him. Blinks.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: See, Connie, every year, the mob
dialog: rakes in two and a half billion
dialog: from football bookmaking. If you
dialog: succeed in making gambling legal,
dialog: all that money goes to the
dialog: government.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I wouldn't be surprised if they
dialog: put out a contract on you. Of
dialog: course, I might be able to call it
dialog: off.
text: Marcon stares him down. A pause. Then Marcon smiles:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 148.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: He's bluffing. He's not connected
dialog: to the mob, what a load of
dialog: horseshit. Nice try, asshole.
dialog: (waves his hand)
dialog: Kill them.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: (plowing ahead)
dialog: Then there's the matter of two
dialog: million dollars. Or didn't you
dialog: know that watertight suitcases
dialog: float...?
text: He once again looks Marcon in the eye.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: I've got your money, Connie.
text: Stashed in the back of a rented

speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Jesus, I don't believe it. This

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I don't think it's working, Joe.
dialog: Try another one.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Hell, I'm fresh out. You wanna
dialog: try one, kid, go for it.
text: A pause. Then, without warning, Jimmy turns --
text: And slugs Hallenbeck with his good arm. Decks him.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Fuck you, Joe, I'm not just gonna
dialog: stand here and die. Mr. Marcon,
dialog: he's lying. We do have the money,
text: but it's not in a car, it's in a
dialog: storage locker. I have the key on
dialog: me. I'l hand it over if you let
dialog: me go.
text: Hallenbeck stares in disbelief.
text: The kid's actually trying something.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Where is the key, Jimmy?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JIMMY
text: It's stashed in my shorts.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: (nods)
dialog: All right. Slow and easy.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Sure. Slow and easy.
text: Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls
text: something out, concealed in his fist.
dialog: We see, but Marcon doesn't:
text: It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Promise you'll let me go.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Hell with that, son. Hand it over
dialog: or I'll have you kneecapped.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad.
dialog: See, it's one of those new plastic
dialog: keys. The kind that melt...?
text: And, with that, he hurls it into the fire.
text: So fast that nobody can see just what he threw.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I guess nobody gets the money.
text: The two hardguys rush to the fireplace.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Pull it out of there!
text: One of them grabs a pair of tongs --
text: and the SHREDDER EXPLODES.
text: Sprays the two hardguys. Cuts them to ribbons.
text: Then, several things happen at once:
text: Everybody goes for a gun.
text: Hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol --
text: As Marcon draws his GUN and FIRES, missing --
scene_heading: Joe RETURNS FIRE, BAM-BAM -- !
text: Catches Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 150.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Baynard draws down on Jimmy, who picks up a flaming log
text: and hurls it, knocks the SHOT wild, as:
text: Marcon darts out the French doors, into the night, so
dialog: Hallenbeck spins, FIRES at Baynard --
text: Blows him backward in a bloody spray. Baynard sags
text: against the mantel. Collapses, dead.
text: ECHOES. Silence. Jimmy and Joe are alone with three
dialog: corpses.
text: Jimmy snatches up a pistol. Joe slings the sniper rifle
text: over his shoulder. Stares at Jimmy:
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Plastic keys...? The kind that

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Hey. Short notice, best I could

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

scene_heading: EXT. MARCON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Acting on a sudden hunch, he SLAMS ON the BRAKES.

dialog: in.
text: A two-million-dollar suitcase sits, pretty as punch, on
text: the back seat.
speaker_heading: MARCON
dialog: Shit, Joe Boy, you wasn't

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

scene_heading: TWO-SHOT BURST. Silenced.

scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME
text: The door flies open. Doesn't hit the wall.

dialog: Keeps going.
text: A body falls out from behind the door.
text: Joe doesn't even look.
text: The body sits up. Not dead yet...

speaker_heading: SARAH

text: The chainsaw clatters to the floor.
text: He does the funny little dance peculiar to those with

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 154.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Where do you want me to go?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: The two million bucks is still in

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Will the police catch Marcon?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Maybe. He's probably in some
text: secret crash pad, packing to leave
dialog: town.
text: A pause, then Sarah says:
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I remember when we got married...
dialog: My friends would talk about their
dialog: husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my
dialog: husband is a big-time publisher,'
dialog: or, 'My husband is a brilliant
dialog: lawyer...' I used to say, 'My

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Don't knock it. It's a skill.
text: She turns. Looks into his eyes.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I want to try, Joe. Do you still
dialog: want to try?
text: A pause. He leans in and kisses her tenderly.
text: And, with typically swell timing, a set of headlights
text: rakes across the window, accompanied by the strobing
text: light of a police flasher.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Ahh, shit. Looks like the local
text: constable has come to chat.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Shall we invite him in?
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: That's not L.A.P.D....
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK'S POV

speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: Milo, who steps out of the car and promptly OPENS FIRE on
dialog: Joe.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: Son of a bitch!
text: He dives for cover, the turf erupting all around him, as:
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - SAME
text: Sarah sits bolt upright. Eyes panicked. Terrified.

speaker_heading: DARIAN
dialog: Mommy, what's happening?

scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE - SAME

speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: advances.

speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You fucked up my face, Joseph!

text: Swings himself onto the raised platform.
text: Flattens behind the billboard.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've
dialog: got all night, you fucked up my
dialog: face.
text: He sprays a BURST of GUNFIRE up at the billboard.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
text: huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch
text: upward. Through the wooden frame.
text: A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm.
text: An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain.
text: Rolls away from the gunfire.
text: Looks around. Desperate.
text: Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby.
text: He counts to three.
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW
text: Milo calmly changes clips.
text: Hallenbeck bursts from cover.
text: Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the front of
text: the billboard, hard and fast --
text: BULLETS CHOPPING the board right behind him, blowing
text: holes in Gorgeous's derrierre --
dialog: And then Joe does a risky thing:
text: He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full
text: tilt, and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 158.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He's trying to make the freeway.
dialog: It's a good fifteen feet. Try it sometime.

dialog: And just does make it.
text: Hits the freeway surface and collapses forward, screaming
text: as he rolls on his injured arm... Looks up --
scene_heading: EIGHTEEN WHEEL TRUCK
text: is headed straight for him, bearing down...!
text: He rolls aside just in time. It THUNDERS past.
text: Staggers to his feet, frantic --
text: and Milo is climbing the billboard.
text: Hallenbeck looks for a place to hide.
dialog: There isn't any.
text: He's going to have to run through traffic.
text: He shifts from foot to foot, searching for an opening,
dialog: and meanwhile --
scene_heading: INT. SUBARU - DRIVING
text: Jimmy Dix is actually on the freeway, driving, when he
text: looks across the center divider and sees Hallenbeck.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: I don't fucking believe it.
text: He swerves over to the side and meanwhile
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
text: watches in dismay as Milo climbs onto the platform...
text: Walks across the front of the billboard.
text: Toward the freeway. Toward Joe. Snarling.
text: Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground. Heaves it.
text: Milo puts up an arm, catches a glancing blow. Blood
text: flows. All it does is piss him off.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You ruined my flesh!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 159.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Hallenbeck dives flat to the road as Milo opens up again,

text: Slews across the road in the middle of traffic.
scene_heading: COLLISIONS. CRUMPLING METAL. EXPLOSIONS of GLASS.

speaker_heading: CAR

dialog: My friends, the fat lady just sang.
dialog: Except another lady says different:
text: A single GUNSHOT SPLITS the air.
text: Milo's chest explodes with bubbling blood.
text: He shrieks. Turns, staring in disbelief at
scene_heading: SARAH HALLENBECK
text: below, on the lawn. She aims Joe's service revolver and
dialog: says:
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You just fucking die.
text: She FIRES again, and Milo reels backward.
text: Leaves a bloody smudge on the billboard.
text: She DROPS the HAMMER again and again. Empties the gun.
text: Milo jerks and twitches. Racked by gunfire.
text: Paints a bloody stripe across the billboard, making
text: Gorgeous's bloody buns even bloodier --
text: Clutches himself. Looks over at Hallenbeck.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK
dialog: She's something, isn't she?
text: Milo pitches forward. Falls to his death.
dialog: 160.
speaker_heading: HALLENBECK

text: A moment passes between them.
text: Around Hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars. HORNS
text: BLARING. Amidst it all, he stands. Beaten. Bloody.
text: Bullet-scarred.
text: Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe.
text: They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says:

speaker_heading: JIMMY

text: Then, as if by some unspoken agreement --
text: The other boy starts to run.
