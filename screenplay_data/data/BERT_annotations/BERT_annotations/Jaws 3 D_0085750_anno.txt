scene_heading: 8	GROUPER'S HEAD								8

speaker_heading: TOD

speaker_heading: KATHRYN

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: KATHRYN

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why? 'Cause they're hungrier?
speaker_heading: PHILIP (V.O.)

speaker_heading: PHILIP

speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KATHRYN

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You set that thing off down there,

speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Precisely.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: I insist you get rid of that bomb.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Afraid I can't do that.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: You're supposed to film it, not

speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Look, Doctor, this isn't one of
dialog: your pet porpoises we're after.
text: It's a torpedo of muscle.
dialog: Murderous expertise! I've seen

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: MIKE

text: starts toward the circling shark.
scene_heading: 121	THE SHARK SEQUENCE							121
text: Intercutting between Kathryn, Philip and Ike and, on

text: moves toward the shark until it starts to circle her,
text: Philip and Ike beginning to film.
text: Her expert maneuvering is not lost on Philip, and he
text: watches with interest -- Mike, on the boat deck,
text: watches what he can with apprehension -- as Kathryn
text: slowly lures the shark toward her.
text: Suddenly, it darts in at her and she jabs the spear
text: at it (into the audience), causing it to veer away.
text: Kathryn seems surprised by this. The shark begins to
text: circle her again, CAMERA PANNING with her as she keeps
text: an eye on it. Philip and Ike keep filming, Mike keeps
text: watching tensely on the deck as Kathryn positions
text: herself, holding the spear extended, moving it back
dialog: and forth.
text: Abruptly, the shark darts in, moving so precipitously
text: that it goes all the way to Kathryn. She ducks and
text: the shark's jaws clamp shut on her air tanks. Philip
text: reacts to this and starts forward to help her as the
text: shark begins to shake her violently from side to side.
text: Letting go of the spear, she tries to hit the shark in
text: the eye but has no success. Philip shows up, and she
text: waves him off. He cannot believe her reaction but
text: doesn't draw his powerhead, only hitting the shark on
text: the head with the camera. This makes it let go of
text: Kathryn's tanks and back off fast. Philip shoving it
text: aside as it passes him, drawing his powerhead just to
text: be safe. The shark does not attack him though, but
text: retreats. Philip looks at Kathryn. She is shaken up,
text: but the chain-mail suit has protected her from injury.
text: She waves him back irritably. Shaking his head either
text: at her or her stupidity, he backs off to Ike,
text: keeping a wary eye on the shark as Kathryn kicks up to
text: the surface to get another spear. On deck, Mike tries
text: to speak to her as she grabs the spear, but she is
text: under again before he can say a word. Kathryn grimly
text: sets herself again. Seeing this, Philip casts his
text: eyes heavenward, as though thinking, "Dear God, the
text: woman's suicidal." She jabs the spear toward the
text: still lingering shark. Finally, after making a few
text: nervous passes, it goes for her. This time, she is
text: able to shoot the sedating spearhead into its stomach,
text: then kicks up toward the surface as fast as she can,
text: the shark starting after her.

speaker_heading: KATHRYN

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: PHILIP

speaker_heading: PHILIP

speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: Before, you were ready to feed

speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: That's because I am the shark.
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
dialog: We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton.
dialog: Our destiny is linked to the fate

speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: The grenade's just to intimidate

scene_heading: 393	INT. SUB - KATHRYN							393

scene_heading: 397	MIKE AND KATHRYN							397

scene_heading: 411	MIKE AND KATHRYN							411
text: Not knowing what to do. They start spasmodically as

text: rush them away.
speaker_heading: 412	THE CHASE								412
text: Shots alternating between Mike and Kathryn being pulled
text: along by the dolphins and the giant shark pursuing them,

text: Seeing where they are, Mike points downward. Kathryn hits
text: Bobby on the side and he dives abruptly. Daisy follows.
scene_heading: 413	UNDERWATER								413
text: The dolphins diving with Mike and Kathryn as they put
text: their mouthpieces back in. We see that they are outside
text: the Control Room, the men inside looking out at them in

text: both take refuge in the concrete recess as the shark
text: zooms into FRAME from behind CAMERA, rushing at them.
scene_heading: 414	INSIDE THE RECESS							414
text: As the huge shark comes at them. Mike activates the
text: outer door of the lock, and they are washed in just as
text: the shark smashes its head against the concrete, jaws
text: missing their feet by inches.
scene_heading: 415	INT. LOCK								415
text: The shark still trying to get at them. Mike shuts the
text: outer door and starts to drain the water from the lock.
text: As it comes below their heads, they pull out their
text: mouthpieces and look at each other with dazed relief.
text: He puts his arms around her, and they lean their fore-
text: heads together, breathing hard. The water is out of
text: the lock in seconds; inside, men activate the inner door.
scene_heading: 416	INT. CONTROL ROOM							416
text: As Mike and Kathryn are helped in by the technicians.
text: One of them looks toward the o.s. window suddenly.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh, my God!
text: They whirl and look.
scene_heading: 417	THE SHARK								417
text: Coming straight at the window as fast as it can. With

text: shattered, a wall of water roaring in.
scene_heading: 418	FULL SHOT - MIKE AND KATHRYN AND THE MEN				418
text: Swept across the Control Room by the giant wave of
text: water flung around. One man is smashed against a wall
text: and killed. Several others make it to the door, getting
text: out just before the water slams it shut.
scene_heading: 419	MIKE AND KATHRYN							419
text: Putting their mouthpieces in again as the Control Room
text: fills with water. They look toward
scene_heading: 420	THE SHARK								420
text: With one of the technicians in its JAWS and is sub-
text: dividing him.
scene_heading: 421	CONTROL ROOM								421
text: Starts flooding. A tape bank topples , crushing
text: female technician.
scene_heading: 422	IMPALED SHARK								422
text: Thrashes violently, working its way in. It's caught
text: on a huge section of thick glass piercing its side.
scene_heading: 423	MIKE AND KATHRYN							423
text: Staring at the shark. Suddenly, the air in Mike's tank
text: runs out and, reacting, he taps Kathryn's arm. She sees
text: his problem, takes a deep breath, and gives him her
text: mouthpiece. They look toward the window at a loud SOUND.
scene_heading: 424	THEIR POV - THE SHARK							424
text: Still very much alive, throwing its gigantic weight
text: forward, getting closer and closer to CAMERA, each
text: violent lurch cutting its side open more, blood pouring
text: from the jagged rent.
scene_heading: 425	ANGLE PAST SHARK ON MIKE AND KATHRYN					425
text: As it gets closer and closer to them. They back away,
text: are blocked by a console.
scene_heading: 426	ANGLE PAST MIKE AND KATHRYN						426
text: Showing the shark closer yet. Despite the impaling
text: blade of glass, despite the internal injuries, the
dialog: shark -- in seconds -- will have them.
scene_heading: 427	CLOSE ON MIKE AND KATHRYN						427
text: Sharing the mouthpiece, huddled together, helpless now.
text: Then Kathryn's eyes widen, both react.
scene_heading: 428	THE SHARK								428
text: Shaking its head as it inches forward, jaws open wide.
scene_heading: 429	MIKE AND KATHRYN							429
text: Drawing back. Kathryn SCREAMS.
scene_heading: 430	THE SHARK								430
text: Emerging from its maw is Philip's body.
scene_heading: 431	PHILIP'S BODY								431
text: We see the GRENADE locked in his fist.
speaker_heading: 432	MIKE									432
text: Quickly grasps a metal strip from the tape bank and
text: fashions a crude hook.
speaker_heading: 433	MIKE									433
text: Times his move perfectly and KNOCKS the grenade out of
text: Philip's locked fist. The grenade comes to rest between
text: the shark's TEETH. Kathryn gives Mike some air, then
speaker_heading: 434	MIKE									434
text: Leaps forward and SNATCHES the grenade out of the
text: shark's mouth.
speaker_heading: 435	MIKE									435
text: Hurriedly wraps a metal strip around the grenade.
speaker_heading: 436	KATHRYN									436
text: Acts as a decoy and lures the shark's attention as
speaker_heading: 437	MIKE									437
text: PULLS the grenade pin and
scene_heading: SHOVES GRENADE
text: Into the distracted shark's mouth.
scene_heading: 438	MIKE GRABS KATHRYN							438
text: And they roll behind a Control Room desk and computer
text: terminal console.
scene_heading: 439	FULL SHOT SHARK								439
text: As the shark is BLOWN OUT backward through the window
text: opening, torn in half by the explosion, its massive
text: remains starting to slide toward the lagoon bottom,
text: turning the water crimson.
scene_heading: 440	MIKE AND KATHRYN							440
text: Grabbing the stunned Kathryn, Mike pulls her to the
text: window and out, starting upward through the bloody
dialog: water.
scene_heading: 441	UNDERWATER - MIKE AND KATHRYN						441
text: Sharing the air, they slowly float to the surface,
text: buddy-buddy breathing.
speaker_heading: 442	SURFACE									442
text: Mike and Kathryn break through. Helping each other,
text: they make their way over to a camera pylon.
scene_heading: 443	MIKE AND KATHRYN							443
text: Cling to the pylon and each other.
speaker_heading: 444	KATHRYN									444
text: Suddenly looks alarmed as she remembers:
speaker_heading: KATHRYN
text: Bobby and Daisy.
text: Mike looks about, no sign of the dolphins.
speaker_heading: 445	KATHRYN									445
text: Slaps the water hard three times.
text: No dolphins.
text: She does it again.
dialog: And again.
speaker_heading: 446	KATHRYN									446
text: And now, in total ANGER AND FRUSTRATION, she pounds the
text: water like Rocky on the punching bag until she is
text: drained, and Kathryn breaks down sobbing as Mike holds
text: her, trying to comfort her.
scene_heading: 447	DOLPHINS								447
text: Come shooting to the surface! They're banged and
text: bruised, but are chirping excitedly and as HAPPY to

scene_heading: 448	DOLPHINS								448
