speaker_heading: REVISED DRAFT
dialog: 04-17-2016
speaker_heading: SPACE
text: Cold. Silent. A billion twinkling stars. Then...
text: A bass RUMBLE rises. Becomes a BONE-RATTLING ROAR as --
dialog: 
text: A SPACECRAFT RACHETS PAST CAMERA, fuel cables WHIPPING
text: into frame, torn loose! Titanium SCREAMS as the ship
text: DETACHES VIOLENTLY; shards CASCADING in zero gravity--!
dialog: (NOTE: For reasons that will become apparent, we let us
dialog: call this vessel “THE ARK.”)
scene_heading: WIDER - THE ARK
text: as it HURTLES AWAY from a docking gantry underneath a vastly
text: LARGER SHIP it was attached to. Wobbly. Desperate.
text: We’re witnessing a HIJACK.
scene_heading: WIDER STILL - THE PREDATOR MOTHER SHIP
text: DWARFS the escaping vessel. Looming; like a nautilus
text: of molded black steel.
scene_heading: INT. PREDATOR MOTHER SHIP
text: Backed by the glow of compu-screens, a half-glimpsed alien --
text: A PREDATOR -- watches the receding ARK through a viewport.
text: (NOTE: we see him mostly in shadow, full reveal to come).
scene_heading: INT. SMALLER VESSEL (ARK)
text: Emergency lights illuminate a dank, organic-looking
scene_heading: interior. CAMERA MOVES PAST:
scene_heading: EIGHT STASIS CYLINDERS
text: Around the periphery. FROST clouds the cryotubes, prevents us
text: from seeing the “passengers.” Finally, CAMERA ARRIVES AT --
scene_heading: A HULKING, DREAD-LOCKED FIGURE
text: The pilot of this crippled ship. We do not see him fully
dialog: either, but for the record? This is our “GOOD” PREDATOR.”
text: HIS TALONS dance across a control panel; a shrill beep..!
text: Predator symbols, but we get the idea: ERROR--ERROR--ERROR--
dialog: Our Predator TAPS more controls. Feverish. Until --
scene_heading: EXT. ARK
text: A final tether COMES LOOSE, venting PLASMA energy, and --
text: Through the viewport, the Ark is enveloped by a BLINDING
text: LIGHT -- then a SWIRL OF PARTICLE ENERGY, as we --
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
text: STARFIELD. Silence. Then --
text: THE ARK DROPS out of hyperspace. SHUDDERS into a NEW ORBIT...
text: Approaching what is, in fact, A DYING PLANET.
text: Ice caps melting; atmosphere toxified; the dominant
text: species continually finding new ways to fuck things up.
dialog: Oddly, the only planet in our solar system not named after
dialog: a God:
dialog: Earth.
scene_heading: INT. THE ARK - DAMAGED FROM THE GETAWAY
text: SPARKS, gagging smoke... Our Predator realizes he’s on
text: a sinking ship... He programs a new command sequence;
scene_heading: ON A MONITOR - A GRAPHIC
text: of the CRYOTUBES. A SCROLLING COUNTDOWN, commenced --
text: in Predator symbols. A self destruct sequence..?
dialog: One last thing:
text: The Predator taps the panel again -- and a SLOT OPENS,
text: revealing A DEVICE like a Steampunk TV remote.
dialog: This is the KUJHAD. Remember it.
text: He extracts it from its slot and -- K-CHK! SNAPS IT into its
text: own WRIST COMPUTER. Then he rises urgently, and...
scene_heading: EXT. STRATOSPHERE
text: The ARK SHUDDERS, penetrating earth’s atmosphere, as: WHOOSH!
scene_heading: AN ESCAPE POD, JETTISONED...
text: From the main body of the craft.
text: A series of RIPPLING SHIMMERS engulf it, and before our
text: eyes, it auto-engages STEALTH CAMOUFLAGE -- and VANISHES..!
text: Pause. Then... a rising swell of JUNGLE NOISES... It begins.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A MAN IN TIGHT CLOSE-UP
text: Rugged face. Stubble. He’s looking down, eyes red-rimmed
dialog: with fatigue, as we HEAR:
text: A hollow TRICKLE of piss in plastic.
text: He finishes. Screws the top back on a thermos. Then lowers
text: it, where it DANGLES ON A THIN NYLON LINE because we are --
scene_heading: EXT. CUBAN JUNGLE - DAY
text: WITH THE SOLDIER, perched in a gnarled tree... THIRTY FEET
text: OFF THE GROUND. He shifts in his “nest.” Brings to bear
text: an M24 sniper rifle.
scene_heading: Meet LIEUTENANT QUINN McKENNA, 30s.
text: On the BACK of his hand... a faded (yet prominent)
text: CRESCENT SCAR. Souvenir of another fight.
scene_heading: SUPER: CAYO MUERTO, CUBA
text: WE HEAR a TALKIE SQUELCH -- then a tinny voice from
text: his Bluetooth headset:
speaker_heading: HAINES’ TALKIE
speaker_heading: VOICE (filtered)
dialog: Piggy One, copy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Piggy One, this is Piggy Two,
dialog: do you copy?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (into
dialog: headset mike)
dialog: I was peeing. Do you mind..?
text: ANOTHER RADIO VOICE joins the conversation, filtered:
speaker_heading: DUPREE’ S TALKIE
dialog: VOICE Piggy Three. I have a
dialog: question, over.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Cut the chatter.
text: He cracks his neck, then adjusts his scope.
scene_heading: DUPREE’S TALKIE VOICE
dialog: Seriously. If you’re the one
dialog: that went to market, right? That
dialog: means Haines and me, we get to
dialog: choose between the roast beef
dialog: and the staying home. Right?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Dupree, I swear to God --
text: McKenna presses his eye to the rifle sight.
scene_heading: HIS POV - THROUGH HIS SCOPE
text: A MANSION. Neoclassical. Built in the 1850s, but painted
text: hot Havana aquamarine. Surrounded by high walls and
text: roaming SENTRIES. You guessed it: A DRUG LORD’S COMPOUND.
scene_heading: DUPREE’S TALKIE VOICE
dialog: I just wanna be the stay home
dialog: piggy, that’s all I’m saying.
scene_heading: HAINES’ TALKIE VOICE
dialog: McKenna. We got a problem.
text: McKenna tenses.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: HAINES’ TALKIE VOICE
dialog: You can’t be the one who went
dialog: to market. You already went wee
dialog: wee wee.
text: McKenna shakes his head; he’s so over these assholes.
text: He wipes away sweat, SWIVELS the rifle, SEEING:
scene_heading: A SMALL CONVOY, NOW
text: On the DIRT ROAD leading into the compound. BLACK SUVs.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: (all business)
text: Eyes north.
scene_heading: HAINES’ TALKIE VOICE
dialog: I see it.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Stay sharp. Ranging now.
text: He presses his eye to the scope, PANNING WITH:
dialog: THE SUVs
text: As they stop, dust rising. DRUG SOLDIERS besiege the
text: vehicles -- roughly PULLING OUT several HOSTAGES with
text: pillow cases over their heads.
text: A MAN in a silk shirt appears. The DRUG LORD faces the
text: sagging hostages, contemptuous. His men raise their weapons.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
speaker_heading: (CONT’D) (into com)
dialog: Target in the reticle, no cross
dialog: wind. I’m not waiting, 10-50 out.
scene_heading: TIGHT CLOSE-UP ON HIS THUMB
text: As he slowly, silently, FLICKS the safety catch. He centers
text: the Drug Lord’s head in the crosshairs. Stops breathing.
text: All in all, a pretty crappy time for an EARTHQUAKE.
text: A deep bass RUMBLE, coming from... where? Above? As,
dialog: utterly without warning --
scene_heading: THE TOP OF THE DRUG LORD’S MANSION -- SHEARED OFF BEFORE
text: OUR EYES. A TSUNAMI of debris, blown loose. EXPELLED --
text: Whatever caused it, it’s headed right AT MCKENNA.
text: He DROPS the rifle; GRABS his combat knife to CUT HIMSELF
text: LOOSE -- TUMBLES, as the canopy of green ERUPTS--!
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: TIME CUT: MCKENNA, ON THE GROUND
text: Amid sudden SILENCE. On his side now, face in the dirt...
speaker_heading: SLANTED POV
text: Showing that the UFO just effectively PUNCHED A TUNNEL in
text: the jungle, strewn with smoking debris and pulped branches.
text: He blinks. No telling how long he was out. A minute? An
text: hour? He looks up, keys his headset:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Piggy Team, do you copy?
text: In his ear, only STATIC.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Goddammit, COPY!
text: Still: nothing but STATIC. McKenna stumbles to his feet.
text: Feeling exposed. Trees, aflame. Smoke everywhere.
text: Exhales raggedly, all too aware he’s squarely in
speaker_heading: THE DEBRIS FIELD
text: left by the spacecraft. Only now, he’s SEEING:
scene_heading: THE PREDATOR EJECTION POD
text: It lies hissing, spitting. Swamped in plant matter. He
text: eases to a halt. Wary. Sights through
speaker_heading: HIS SCOPE
text: And we notice, first off -- the HATCH. It’s open, steam
text: curling from inside. He stalks forward, past the muddy,
text: smoking IMPACT CRATER. Looks down. Frowns:
text: DROPLETS OF FLUORESCENT FLUID
text: On the ground. Lying amidst them, something we recognize:
text: A Predator WRIST GAUNTLET. Discarded? Jarred loose?
text: Beside it, he notices something else: a tiny metal
text: DEVICE that resembles a trilobite. A CLOAKING BALL.
text: McKenna stoops -- palms the alien-looking device...
speaker_heading: HEARS VOICES.
text: He DIVES behind a fallen LOG. Snaps the rifle to
text: his shoulder, sights downrange. 300 yards --
text: People are swarming out of the drug mansion. Fuck.
text: He nervously juggles the metal BALL.... absently depresses
dialog: a SWITCH (an electronic HUM) --
text: He looks left -- all clear. Glances over his shoulder.
text: Looks to his RIGHT -- ohmyfuckingGod.
text: Jumps a foot. A FUCKING PREDATOR.
text: Two feet away -- and it wasn’t there a SECOND AGO.
text: He scrambles backward, blinks:
text: The PREDATOR, stock still. No reaction. Simply lies
text: there, all eight feet of it. Its MASK askew. We realize:
text: He’s been there ALL ALONG. McKenna merely DE-CLOAKED him.
text: He holds his breath, cautious not to wake the sleeping
dialog: beast. That said, he can’t resist.
text: Licks his lips, reaches... cautiously LIFTS the dislodged
text: BATTLE MASK worn by the Predator. Looks down, blanching --
text: At the insectile craziness this thing calls a FACE.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Fuck me.
text: He dry-washes his face with his hand. Scans the alien tech
text: -- mask, gauntlet. Evidence. With quick, practiced moves,
text: STASHES them in his pack --
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Sorry, bud. Without these, no
dialog: one’s gonna believe me.
text: He starts to go, STOPS. Looks back, says softly:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Welcome to earth, brother. Just
dialog: so you know..?
dialog: (lights up)
dialog: It only gets worse from here.
text: He turns. RUNS... As he leaves frame, CAMERA settles on
text: the hulking, sprawled PREDATOR --
text: Its EYES SNAP OPEN.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - WITH McKENNA - DAY
text: Moving through the overgrowth. Sudden CRACKLE of
dialog: radio chatter:
speaker_heading: HAINES’ TALKIE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Repeat: switch to 30-30, Dupree,
dialog: do you copy?
text: THEY'RE BACK ONLINE. Bingo. McKenna stops, keys his walkie:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
text: Piggy Two, respond, over.
scene_heading: HAINES’ TALKIE VOICE
dialog: McKenna, is that you?
text: Now DUPREE’S voice joins in:
speaker_heading: DUPREE’ S TALKIE
dialog: VOICE Hi, guys. Can I just say -
dialog: - holy shit?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: We’re blown. Move out, converge
dialog: for extraction.
speaker_heading: HAINES’ VOICE
dialog: Copy that. I have visual on Dupree,
dialog: I -- what the fuck..?
text: McKenna freezes.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Did not copy that. Talk to me,
dialog: Haines.
speaker_heading: HAINES’ VOICE
dialog: I... There’s something moving...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Dupree, break left, break left--!
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Talk to me, what’s happening??
text: A RATTLE OF MACHINE GUN FIRE -- BRRRAPPP!!! --
text: A series of strangled HUMAN SCREAMS. HE DOESN’T NEED
text: THE WALKIE, HE CAN HEAR THEM --
text: McKenna CHARGES BACK in the direction he just came from.
text: He SNAPS his rifle to his shoulder; TEARING through
text: the brush. HEARTBEAT thudding in his ears... as:
scene_heading: A NEW SOUND, NOW -- RISING.
text: A low, bass THUMPING -- WHUP-WHUP-WHUP. He looks up, SEES:
scene_heading: A BLACK HELICOPTER
text: Inbound, range 500 meters. What the hell? Skimming the
text: treeline... on a bee-line for the Drug Lord’s compound.
text: McKenna frowns: his extraction..? No. Impossible. Wrong
text: helicopter. He heaves to his feet, switches on his mic:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (INTO MIC) (CONT’D)
text: Mayday. TIC in process. Bogey
text: inbound. AH-6 Little Bird, BLACK,
dialog: no markings. Who sent these gu--
text: The chopper UNLEASHES TWO AIR-TO-SURFACE ROCKETS.
text: A sudden, sky-high whooosh... McKenna, AGAPE -- They
text: come vectoring in, remorseless. DETONATE--!
text: Say goodbye to the mansion. The sentries.
dialog: The Drug Lord. And his Soldiers. AND the Hostages. All
text: gone in one horrendous, volcanic SECOND --
dialog: Pretty much the job McKenna came here to do. Except
dialog: no prisoners, no witnesses, no mercy.
dialog: Scorched. Fucking. Earth.
text: The chopper BANKS sharply, coming in for a landing. BLACK-
text: CLAD MERCS, already leaning out the sides...
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
text: Debris pelting down around him. Stumbling, gun up --
text: Bursts through a thicket into a clearing --
text: BACK WHERE HE LEFT THE PREDATOR
dialog: But no Predator.
text: Just a sea of blood.
text: THE REMAINS OF TWO SOLDIERS; dressed like McKenna. Same
text: camo face paint, jungle khakis. His men.
text: McKenna spins, gun tracking. Sights down the barrel:
speaker_heading: BLACK OPS MERCS
text: From the helicopter. Headed his way.
text: No way out. McKenna looks to his team; shredded. EVISCERATED.
text: Draws a shuddering breath...
text: BOLTS. Deeper into the jungle -- leaving them behind, as over
text: the scene, from everywhere and nowhere, a piercing SHRIEK --
text: An eerie PREDATOR WAR CRY, echoing... as we END SEQUENCE.
scene_heading: CROSS FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BUSY CUBAN STREET (AGUJERO MIERDA) - DAY
text: Traffic. Choking fumes. Blaring Afro-Cuban JAZZ.
text: THREE CUBAN POLICE OFFICERS push through the locals.
text: Flashing an 8x10 PHOTOGRAPH. Chattering urgently.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON PHOTO
text: An Air Force Lieutenant in dress blues. Handsome.
text: Clean-shaven. MCKENNA.
text: The COPS pass by an ALLEY, routinely peer inside --
text: Empty. DEAD END. Garbage cans, filth, dried urine. A CAT.
text: No sign of McKenna. They move on.
text: WE HOLD AS...
dialog: 10.
text: The brindled CAT begins to ripple. To distort.
scene_heading: GLASS-LIKE HUMAN CONTOURS
text: appear, against the surrounding stucco. A CRACKLE of
dialog: energy, like TV static, AS --
text: A MAN materializes before our eyes. Bedraggled,
text: unshaven. Edgy. MCKENNA.
text: HE’S USING THE PREDATOR’S CLOAKING BALL.
scene_heading: INT. SLEAZY CANTINA - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
text: AN UNSAVORY PATRON sits at a table, alone. A VOICE:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA’S VOICE (0O.S.)
dialog: Dominguez.
text: McKenna “DE-CLOAKS,” again using the Predator device. Seems
text: to WALK OUT OF THE WALL. DOMINGUEZ, suitably terrified --
text: McKenna TOSSES A BOX onto the table: THUNK--!
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (SUBTITLED)
dialog: This needs to get across the
dialog: border. U.S.A. No molestar,
dialog: comprende?
text: McKenna sweeps side tattered DRAPES to reveal a squat,
text: UGLY building. The U.S. CONSULATE.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (SUBTITLED) (CONT’D)
dialog: Mail out of the consolate has
dialog: immunity. Get it on the
dialog: embassy truck.
text: Dominguez eyes the parcel.
speaker_heading: DOMINGUEZ (SUBTITLED)
dialog: I am very scared of the way you
text: appeared to materialize out of
text: the wall.
text: McKenna plunks 12 thousand pesos on the table. In English:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Do it. Or I’1ll find you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CANTINA - DAY
text: McKenna steps outside, affecting nonchalance --
dialog: 11.
text: The CLATTER of M4s being hefted and aimed at his HEAD.
text: A SUITED MAN steps into view. Intense, calculating eyes.
text: Clearly in charge. For the record? Agent TRAEGER, CIA.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: McKenna. You’ve been busy.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
text: Traeger flashes his ID. Gestures to the police.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: My friends here’1l escort you to
dialog: the airfield. Got a DC-8 all
text: gassed up and ready to go.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Wow. Thanks, pal. Where to?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Can’t decide. Either Six Flags,
text: or a remote secure prison.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I don’t like roller coasters.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: There it is, then.
text: He FIRES from the hip. A DART embeds itself in McKenna.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN SCHOOL (GEORGIA) - ESTABLISHING - DAY
dialog: A proud sign:
scene_heading: LAWRENCE G. GORDON MIDDLE SCHOOL
dialog: “Home of The Warriors”
scene_heading: HALLOWEEN HAUNT 10/25
speaker_heading: WELCOME PARENTS & STDS
text: CUT TO: A BLACK KNIGHT
text: as it topples a WHITE PAWN on a chess board.
scene_heading: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
text: The room’s hushed. Respectful. Because at lunchtime, those
text: tabletops with the sinks? They make way for THE CHESS CLUB.
dialog: 12.
text: SIX or SEVEN games, in progress. The SCIENCE TEACHER eats his
dialog: lunch at his desk, as... oh, yeah. We should probably mention
scene_heading: THE AWKWARD KID
text: Eating a sandwich with the crusts cut off as he wanders,
text: scrutinizes every game, like a NASA scientist.
dialog: This is RORY, 12.
text: He doesn’t know it yet, but he’s going to save the world.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL BREEZEWAY - DAY
text: TWO BULLIES stand near a fire alarm, daring each other to
dialog: pull it. Meet E.J. and DEREK. They will grow up, get bald,
dialog: and attempt to sell you a car.
scene_heading: INT. SCIENCE CLASS - DAY
text: The alarm PEALS, deafening. EVERYONE’s up like a
text: shot, quickly SHUFFLING OUT of the room. Leaving:
text: RORY, who -- nobody notices -- is curled up in a FETAL
text: BALL; fingers in his ears, eyes squeezed shut, the alarm
text: like fingernails on a chalkboard to him.
text: E.J. AND DEREK appear at the door... Spot Rory, who flinches;
text: a deer in headlights. The bullies move in for the kill...
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Hey, E.J., you hungry?!
dialog: E.J.
dialog: Hell, yeah! You know what I’m
dialog: hungry for? An ASS BURGER!
text: He KICKS Rory. The nick-name confirms our suspicions: the
text: awkward kid is awkward for a reason: the autism spectrum.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Mm, that sounds delicious! A
text: big, juicy ASS BURGER.
text: Derek gets his kick in. They’re about to unleash more when
text: -- the alarm STOPS. Sudden, unnerving quiet.
text: Time running out, E.J. and Derek look around for one
dialog: last indignity.
text: They settle for this: KNOCKING OVER ALL THE CHESS PIECES.
dialog: Every game ruined.
text: He and Derek trade a LAUGHING high-five, and they’re GONE.
dialog: 13.
text: For a quiet, electric moment, Rory is alone in the room.
text: His eyes flicker across the chess boards: mental inventory.
text: Beat. Then -- he SCRAMBLES INTO ACTION. It takes a moment
text: to register what he’s doing. Another to believe it.
text: He puts back every chess piece on every board exactly as they
dialog: were before the fire alarm..
text: The Chess Club members filter in and return to their games,
text: none the wiser. OFF Rory, beaming silently -- CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBS - DAY
text: Heading home. Rory LOPES along, talking to himself. Suddenly:
text: a strident BARKING from behind a picket fence, where:
speaker_heading: A PIT BULL
text: GROWLS and SNAPS from between the posts. Rory freaks;
text: gives the dog a wide berth, clearly terrified.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - RORY’S HOUSE - DAY
text: The sound of a KEY IN A LOCK, then Rory comes through
text: the back door. Replaces the key under the porch mat.
scene_heading: A STAIN -- ON THE KITCHEN WALL
text: Briefly makes him FIXATE. Seepage. A WATER SPOT. He grabs a
text: paper towel, delicately blots away the run-off -- goes to
text: the refrigerator. On which, a hand-written note:
scene_heading: SPENT 1.5 HRS CLEANING HOUSE.
dialog: IF YOU MESS IT UP, I WILL CUT YOU.
speaker_heading: XOXO MOM
text: A doorbell RINGS off-screen, and --
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - SAME
text: Rory opens the door, is greeted by a POSTAL WORKER.
speaker_heading: POSTAL WORKER
dialog: Quinn McKenna live here?
text: Rory blinks, not sure what to say.
speaker_heading: POSTAL WORKER (CONT’D)
dialog: Didn’t mean to stump you. How’s
dialog: this: is Quinn McKenna your mom,
dialog: or your dad?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Dad.
speaker_heading: POSTAL WORKER
dialog: Now we’re gettin’ somewhere.
text: He upends a handcart -- dumps a big stack of LETTERS
text: AND BOXES onto the porch.
speaker_heading: POSTAL WORKER (CONT’D)
text: His P.O. box payments are past due.
dialog: I’m real sorry.
text: He starts away. Hesitates.
speaker_heading: POSTAL WORKER (CONT’D)
dialog: Guess he’s not around much, huh?
text: Rory nods. Awkward. The postman frowns:
speaker_heading: POSTAL WORKER (CONT’D)
text: Lotta D.C. post marks. Government
dialog: work?
speaker_heading: RORY
scene_heading: MOS 11B3VW3.
text: The postman, confused.
speaker_heading: RORY (CONT’D)
dialog: Military designation.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He kills people.
text: The postman decides he’s done here. Rory watches him go,
text: as we PAN the huge stack of mail, so that WE SEE:
scene_heading: McCKENNA’S PARCEL FROM CUBA.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOG PARK NEAR U.C. BERKELEY - DAY
text: CASEY BRACKETT, 27, sits on a bench, red penciling papers.
text: LEASHES dangle from one arm... a dog BARKS CRAZILY 0O.S.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (to unseen dog)
dialog: Summer! Stop that! That’s not
dialog: yours, does it look like it’s
dialog: yours?
dialog: 15.
text: A JOGGER with a dog runs by; eyes Casey. Perhaps “ogles”
text: would be more apt. He backtracks. Jogs in place beside
text: her, catching his breath.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: How’s it goin’?
text: He huffs, as though having just pushed a boulder uphill.
text: Elaborately towels his neck. A curt DOG-YELP, off-screen --
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (to unseen dog)
dialog: Teddy! Knock it off, you can
dialog: see she doesn’t like that!
text: The jogger, persistent. Extends his hand:
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: Seen you around here. Doug Amaturo.
text: He conspicuously scritches the ears of his designer DOG --
speaker_heading: JOGGER (CONT’D)
dialog: This is Barkolepsy. She has a...
dialog: sleeping thing. She’s a lab--
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: -- Labradoodle.
dialog: Hypoallergenic cross between
text: a poodle and a labrador.
text: Casey STANDS, starts to walk. Persistant Guy, following --
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Right. That’s right. Are you
dialog: a breeder?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Science professor. Berkeley.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: What do you teach?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Evolutionary biology. The science
dialog: of how creatures change, adapt.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: You mean, like... how a man changes
dialog: when he meets an attractive woman?
text: Casey grins sourly.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: More like -- survival of
dialog: the fittest.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: You believe in that stuff?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: You mean science? Yeah. Yes, I
dialog: do. (beat)
dialog: It’s funny, Darwin thought it
dialog: was about strength, agility,
dialog: intelligence... These days, you
dialog: just have to be a rich, fat
dialog: white guy.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: I... what?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Drop a CEO into the Serengeti. Only
dialog: question -- what color animal shits
dialog: him out. My vote? Reddish-tan.
text: The Jogger: Gulp. He nods slowly.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: Um, I don’t wanna hold you up so...
text: He BOLTS. Casey reaches in her jacket, fishes out a silver
text: FLASK -- swigs -- A kindly OLD LADY looks up, says:
speaker_heading: OLD LADY
dialog: I couldn’t help overhearing. Can
dialog: I ask you something, professor?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: OLD LADY
dialog: What do your students call you?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: “Professor,” mostly.
speaker_heading: OLD LADY
dialog: (smiles sweetly)
dialog: Maybe they should call
dialog: you Sunshine.
text: A VOICE interrupts:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Doctor Brackett?
dialog: 17.
text: Casey turns -- THREE CIA AGENTS stand there. A SEDAN with
text: government plates idles ominously behind them. The lead
dialog: agent is CHURCH, 30s.
speaker_heading: AGENT CHURCH
dialog: I understand you enjoy star gazing.
text: Casey blinks. WIF? THEN we get it: some kind of CODE.
speaker_heading: AGENT CHURCH (CONT’D)
dialog: My men will take care of your dogs.
dialog: Would you come with me, please?
text: OFF Casey, rattled. CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GOVERNMENT SEDAN - SAME
text: Casey and the CIA man climb into the back. As the driver
text: pulls out, she looks out the back -- at her dogs.
speaker_heading: AGENT CHURCH (CONT’D)
dialog: Dog person, huh?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Hey, they don’t judge you, they
dialog: don’t lie. People have hidden
dialog: agendas. Animals just love you,
dialog: or-- tear your throat out. I kinda
dialog: have to respect that.
text: Church hands her a file folder.
speaker_heading: AGENT CHURCH
dialog: How are you with higher forms
dialog: of life?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I wasn’t aware there were any.
text: As she opens the file, he shines a pen light to
text: illuminate the TOP SHEET:
scene_heading: CLASSIFIED: PROJECT STARGAZER
text: The letterhead? A familiar eagle-and-shield insignia:
text: CIA. The page has been stamped TOP SECRET:
scene_heading: MEMORANDUM FOR CLEARED PERSONNEL
scene_heading: SUBJECT: Class 4 Incursion -- Cayo Muerta, Cuba

dialog: 18.
text: The debris field; the charred escape pod. Next -- McKENNA’s
text: MILITARY PORTRAIT -- the one Traeger was showing the locals

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I thought this was a psych eval.
text: The V.A. PSYCHOLOGIST stands by, watching a MED TECH
text: attach two pnuemo-tubes around McKenna’s chest.
speaker_heading: V.A. PSYCH
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: So why the polygraph?
text: The Med Tech attaches finger pads and a blood pressure cuff.
speaker_heading: V.A. PSYCH
dialog: It’s common with high risk civil
dialog: servants. We need to know if you
dialog: pose a threat.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I’m an assassin. Figured posing

speaker_heading: V.A. PSYCH

speaker_heading: MCKENNA

dialog: I don’t really see tracks on

dialog: The Psych nods:
speaker_heading: V.A. PSYCH
dialog: But you do see a vast... cover-up.

speaker_heading: V.A. PSYCH (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell me about Cayo Muerto, Cuba.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: People died. I saw something I

text: flicker. All graphs straight as arrows.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT! D)
dialog: You’ re gonna have to do better’n

speaker_heading: V.A. PSYCH
dialog: You think I’m the enemy, don’t you,

dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I think you want me to say
dialog: something crazy, so you can lock
dialog: me in a room and throw away the
dialog: room. That’s what I think.
speaker_heading: V.A. PSYCH
dialog: Maybe some time in a quiet
dialog: room would do you some good.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: You know what would do me some
dialog: good? Knowing who -- or WHAT --
dialog: killed my men. And what that thing
dialog: in the jungle was. AND why the fuck
text: a Black Ops helicopter conveniently
text: showed up out of nowhere to make
dialog: sure there weren’t any witnesses.

speaker_heading: MCKENNA

speaker_heading: PSYCH SPECIALIST
dialog: You were pinned down. You lost a

dialog: interrogated. Forget the details,
dialog: but since then--? You spend most of
dialog: your time in country... estranged

dialog: don’t feel like -- well, you

speaker_heading: WILLIAMS

speaker_heading: CASEY

scene_heading: A LAMINATED PHOTO ID BADGE

scene_heading: INT. PROJECT STARGAZER
text: The elevator door slides OPEN TO REVEAL...

speaker_heading: VIEWING ROOM
text: Like an operating theater, looking down through raked

text: She sees MED TECHS IN BIOHAZARD SUITS around a custom-built
text: table with stirrups and monitors. Take a breath now --
dialog: 24.
text: Because there, strapped to the table, is something she’s

scene_heading: A CAPTURED, UNCONSCIOUS PREDATOR.

dialog: Doctor Colwell.
text: He enters, shakes her hand.
speaker_heading: COLWELL (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m told you pretty much wrote

speaker_heading: CASEY

dialog: Um... books...
speaker_heading: COLWELL
dialog: So you know your stuff. How’d

text: She looks back into the lab below. Pensive.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I wrote a letter when I was six.
dialog: Said I loved animals and... if
dialog: NASA ever found a space animal,
dialog: they should call me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Couple years ago, they put me ona
dialog: short list because of a paper I
dialog: wrote on hybrid strains. A computer

scene_heading: SERIES OF CUTS -- DECON

scene_heading: PRE-RECORDED VOICE
dialog: Protocol complete.
text: She dons a HAZMAT SUIT, all business. Dismissive of her

speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Thanks for coming. I’m sure -

dialog: -- you have questions.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Two, actually.
text: She nods to the dormant Predator.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: Why do you call it “the Predator”?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Just a nick-name. The data suggests
text: it tracks its prey, seems to...
dialog: well, enjoy it. Like a game.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That’s a hunter.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That’s a hunter. Not a predator.
dialog: Predators kill for food, to
dialog: survive. There’s only one animal
dialog: on earth that hunts for sport.
text: Traeger tries not to roll his eyes; “liberal.”
text: Casey paces beside the Predator. Regards its mandibled
text: features with something akin to wonder. Whispers:
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (CONT’D) You... are one
dialog: beautiful motherfucker.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: I’m going to assume your second
dialog: question is: why are you here?
text: An ironic grin from Casey. “Bingo.”
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’ D)
dialog: Our test results yielded something
dialog: a little... odd. We were wondering
dialog: if maybe you could shed some light
text: on it.
text: He nods to COLWELL, who produces a TABLET. He shows Casey
text: a read-out. She studies it for a second... then blanches.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Is this a joke?
speaker_heading: COLWELL
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: We ran the genome sequence ten
dialog: times. This specimen has --
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: -- human DNA.
text: She looks at them, baffled. How is that possible?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: We know about spontaneous
dialog: speciation. Mostly plants
dialog: and insects, but --
speaker_heading: COLWELL
text: -- some mammals. Sheeps, goats. Red
dialog: wolves are known to be a hybrid of
text: coyotes and gray wolves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Exactly. Possibly some form of

text: The wounded soldier MOANS loudly. Shit. He’s going to give

text: And as the soldier BITES INTO MCKENNA’S HAND to

scene_heading: INT. V.A. BUS - DRIVING (BACK TO SCENE)
text: As McKENNA WAKES. No startle-awake bullshit -- simply comes

dialog: THE SCAR we saw in Cayo Muerte: prominent. Now we know how
text: he got it. From the back of the bus, now, A VOICE:
speaker_heading: COYLE
dialog: Hey, Baxley! Got a question for
dialog: ya. How do you circumcise a
dialog: homeless man?
text: He’s addressing a prisoner at the front, BAXLEY, whose
text: eyes thin to slits. Clearly, these two have a history.
speaker_heading: COYLE (CONT’D)
dialog: Kick your mom in the chin!
text: One of the MPs at the front weighs in:
speaker_heading: MP ON BUS
dialog: Shut the fuck up back there!

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Dinner and a show. Great.

speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: He likes the jokes.
text: McKenna looks to a THIRD prisoner, talking to
text: himself nervously, Tourette’s: FLYBOY.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS (CONT’D)
text: That’s Flyboy. Three tours piloting
text: Hueys. Now he gets jumpy when he’s
text: not in the air.
text: McKenna nods to an older Vet -- NETTLES.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS (CONT’D)
dialog: Nettles. Ordnance man. They gave
dialog: him a medal for blowing up half

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Why’s he here?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Blew up the other half,
dialog: too. (beat)
dialog: Everyone’s got a story.
dialog: What’s yours?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: You wouldn’t believe me.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: This is the batshit bus. Try me.
text: McKenna shrugs.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: All right.

text: A nearby MED TECH nods. Casey turns to Traeger.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you have the file they gave me?
dialog: The incident in Cayo Muerto..?
text: Traeger nods to the med tech. The file is quickly produced
text: and Casey FLIPS to the blurry photo of the Predator. Points:
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
text: In this photo, it’s wearing
dialog: some kind of... atmosphere
text: mask, a biohelmet.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: We looked, believe me.
text: She notices something else:
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: And look at the wrist computer.
text: Something’s missing.
text: Sure enough, the Predator’s wrist computer is OPEN -- an
text: empty slot where the KUJHAD should be. She looks at Traeger:
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: Where are they?
text: Traeger and Colwell trade uneasy glances. After a beat,
text: Casey re-opens the file. FLIPS to the photo of... MCKENNA.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: Is this the man who made
dialog: first contact?
dialog: (Colwell nods)
dialog: I’d like to talk to him.
speaker_heading: COLWELL
text: He’s en route to lockdown in

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Rory? I’m home! I got

speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: You did one of these after school?
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: I did all of them after school.
text: She smiles, fumbles with a bag from Target.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So look. I got you two options...
text: She pulls out TWO BOXED HALLOWEEN COSTUMES -- Like those
dialog: Ben Cooper specials from yesteryear. In this case..?
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: Pirate..? Or Frankenstein..?
text: She holds up each with equal gusto; he regards her blankly:
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: What’s Frankenstein?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You know -- Frankenstein. Mad
dialog: doctor made him out of dead people?
dialog: Bolts on his neck? Walks around?
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Like “Walking Dead”?
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No, Frankenst... Green skin? He met
dialog: Wolfman?
text: Rory looks at her like she grew a tail. Exasperated, she
text: holds up the OTHER BOX as if her son just won a prize.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: Let’s go with PIRATE -- !!
text: But he’s not really buying any of it. He takes the mask
text: out of the box, reluctantly puts it on.
text: RORY’S POV: The sound of his BREATHING as, through the
speaker_heading: eye holes, WE SEE:

dialog: FIST through the SPOT, for reasons long forgotten, and --
text: BACK TO PRESENT
text: It’s been plastered over; yet the ghost of McKenna’s rage

speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: It’s too small. The guys’ll...
dialog: you know.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: They’1l still be able to tell.
speaker_heading: RORY’S MOM
dialog: Tell what?
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: That it’s me.

text: A hanging sign reads: “CONTROL AREA.”
text: Rory sits, fingers blurring as he speed runs through two
text: games simultaneously. But gradually... his distraction wins.
text: He turns to look at his work table, ON WHICH RESIDES:
scene_heading: THE PARCEL FROM CUBA.
text: He sucks in a sharp breath. Goes to it... and TEARS IT OPEN
text: like a Christmas present. Reaches in, and removes...
scene_heading: Holy shit -- THE BATTLE-SCARRED PREDATOR BIOHELMET.
text: The iconic WAR MASK from five separate films. It DWARFS
text: this suburban boy’s delicate hands.
text: He examines it. Sets it aside, reaches for the next prize:
text: THE KUJHAD; the data-storage device. It GLISTENS in
text: his grasp. He hefts it like a light-sabre. Then --
text: Curiously, hesitantly, presses a button on the device.
dialog: Nothing.
text: Emboldened, he presses another. And another. And anoth
dialog: -- BLEEP--! Oooh, shit.
text: A DISPLAY BLINKS ON; GLOWING RED symbols scrolling in
text: cryptic patterns. Rory’s eyes widen as we -- CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OUTER SPACE
text: Cold. Silent. OUR OPENING SHOT all over again, as...
text: A LOOMING SPACECRAFT enters frame. Bulbous. Cockroach-
dialog: shaped. We’ve seen it before:
scene_heading: THE PREDATOR MOTHER SHIP

text: and shredded from where THE ARK detached.
scene_heading: INT. PREDATOR SHIP - SAME
text: Quick, tantalizing glimpses of this new, different PREDATOR.
text: We still don’t see him fully. Not yet.
dialog: As we will come to learn: this is AN UPGRADE.
dialog: 34.
text: It taps a control pad -- and a DISPLAY APPEARS, similar
dialog: to Rory’s. Speaking of whom:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - RORY
text: SCRIBBLES the symbols from the Kujhad on a PeeChee
dialog: folder. Glances up --
text: The symbols CHANGE. Blip-! Just like that, a new
text: sequence. Rory scrunches up his face. Huh.
dialog: Have you ever seen someone “do math” by using their fingers
dialog: to create invisible equations in the air? Well, that’s what
dialog: Rory does now, except...
text: THE SYMBOLS HE WROTE LIFT off the paper, SUPERIMPOSED for
dialog: us to see. He does some mental calculations, and --
text: The symbols RE-ARRANGE.
text: (NOTE: This is NOT REAL. It depicts Rory’s mental process.
text: We are literally watching him translate Predator language.)
dialog: 
text: He TAPS BUTTONS, causing the display to CHANGE BACK, and --
scene_heading: INT. PREDATOR SHIP - THAT MOMENT
text: THE UPGRADE REACTS as his READ-OUT CHANGES, too. A glitch? He
text: taps the controls, REVERTING it to its previous version --
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - RORY
text: sees the DISPLAY CHANGE again -- and OVERRIDES IT exactly
dialog: as he did before. “Take that!” And we realize --

scene_heading: INT. PREDATOR SHIP

dialog: and the ship literally VANISHES--!
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - ON RORY

dialog: You okay down there, kiddo?
text: Rory freezes, tries to sound like everything’s normal.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Just playing games, mom!
speaker_heading: EMILY (0O.S.)
dialog: Love you!
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Oui, J'aime ma mére!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSE ON A TRACKING MONITOR
text: as a BLIP APPEARS. Then vanishes. Then RE-APPEARS.
scene_heading: INT. SATELLITE TRACKING STATION - NIGHT
text: A TECH SERGEANT in army khaki watches the blip on his scope.
scene_heading: SUPER: KAENA POINT TRACKING STATION -- OAHU, HAWAII
text: The analyst FLAGS his SUPERVISOR.
scene_heading: TRACKING ANALYST
dialog: Sir?
text: His uniformed SUPERVISOR walks over.
scene_heading: TRACKING SUPERVISOR
dialog: Whatcha got, sergeant?
scene_heading: TRACKING ANALYST
dialog: Weird-ass bogey, sir. What do
dialog: you make of it?
text: They watch as the blip VANISHES and RE-APPEARS sporadically.
text: OTHER TECHS look on curiously. The supervisor frowns.
scene_heading: TRACKING SUPERVISOR
dialog: Get me NORAD.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LAB (PROJECT STARGAZER) - AS BEFORE
text: CASEY, bent over an electron microscope. Intent. Examining
text: the Predator’s blood. Traeger, over her shoulder --
dialog: 36.
text: She rises from the microscope, sees a blood centrifuge
text: nearby, a test tube rack just above it. In the rack is:
text: A SINGLE VIAL of membranous yellow substance. She frowns:
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Wait a minute.
dialog: (re: centrifuge)
dialog: If this is blood --
dialog: (re: vial)
dialog: -- then what’s that?
text: Traeger looks vaguely discomfited. But before he can
text: answer, a LACKEY approaches.
speaker_heading: LACKEY
dialog: V.A. shuttle’s here, sir.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - ABANDONED MILITARY BASE - NIGHT
text: Black-clad MERCENARIES wait for the V.A. SHUTTLE as
text: it trundles toward the chain link perimeter.
scene_heading: INT. V.A. BUS - DRIVING - SAME
text: Prisoners, GRUMBLING. Flyboy calls out to the MP at the
text: front (who, we should note, is bald as a cue ball).
speaker_heading: FLYBOY
dialog: Hey, Kojak! When did they put the
dialog: middle of fucking nowhere on the
dialog: itinerary?
speaker_heading: MP ON BUS
dialog: Zip it, Flyboy. We’re just makin’
text: a pit stop.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: “Pit stop.”
dialog: (to McKenna)
dialog: This is all your fault, isn’t it?
text: McKenna, uneasy. It’s beginning to seem that way. CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NORTH AMERICAN AEROSPACE DEFENSE COMMAND, COLORADO
dialog: Fans of War Games will recognize the gallery and massive
text: TRACKING SCREENS. Air Force PERSONNEL watch the bogey on
speaker_heading: A HUGE MONITOR
text: where THE BLIP is seen moving toward the southern U.S...
text: A GENERAL oversees; STAFF SERGEANT at his side.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: STAFF SERGEANT
dialog: Still inbound, sir. One
dialog: second they’re on the grid,
text: the next they’re ghosting.
speaker_heading: NORAD GENERAL
dialog: Radio contact?
speaker_heading: STAFF SERGEANT
dialog: Negative, sir.
text: The General chews on a pen. What the fuck is it? Finally:
speaker_heading: NORAD GENERAL
dialog: Where’s the 325th?
speaker_heading: STAFF SERGEANT
dialog: Lackland, sir.
speaker_heading: NORAD GENERAL
text: Have them scramble some jets.
dialog: Let’s not take any chances.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LAB (PROJECT STARGAZER) - THAT MOMENT
text: Traeger’s AIDE approaches. Furtive:
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: Sir, NORAD’s reporting a
dialog: 202 anomaly.
text: Colwell and Traeger trade looks. Casey sees this.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Look, I know I’m new, but -- it’d
dialog: be swell if somebody would kinda
dialog: sorta, I dunno... tell me what
dialog: the fuck is going on here?
text: Traeger answers without missing a beat.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: This isn’t the first Predator
dialog: we’ve encountered.
text: Casey stiffens. The revelation lands hard.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’ D)
dialog: Apparently they use earth as a
dialog: kind of “hunting ground.”
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: COLWELL
dialog: They’ ve left things behind.
text: Evidence. Weapons. Some are
dialog: even stored in this facility.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Your point -- ?
speaker_heading: COLWELL
dialog: The point, doctor... is that our
dialog: satellite defense stations have
text: just tracked a new UFOB.
dialog: (nods grimly to the
dialog: dormant Predator)
dialog: Our friend here might have
dialog: company coming.
dialog: 
text: Traeger MUTTERS something under his breath --
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: They’ re gnarly fuckers, that’s all.
dialog: Took four of my best just to bring
dialog: that one down.
text: She blinks. Stares at him:
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I’m sorry. It took four--?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: That’s right. So?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: So -- a meth head can take
text: down four men.
dialog: (re: Predator)
dialog: Look at it!
text: Traeger looks uneasy.
speaker_heading: COLWELL
dialog: What’s your point, doctor?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: My point is you brought it here. To
dialog: a location where you just happen to
dialog: store its weapons --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How do you know it didn’t WANT
dialog: TO BE CAPTURED?
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
text: That’s when ALARM KLAXONS peal throughout the complex.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: What’s happening?
text: TRAEGER’S AIDE clutches a phone receiver. YELLS:
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: Proximity alert, sir! Bogey’s
dialog: inbound! Range two hundred miles!
dialog: At which point, without warning --
text: THE PREDATOR’S EYES SNAP OPEN. Just like that.
text: Alert. Calm. Calculating. We realize: it was playing possum.
text: CASEY LEAPS backward; liberates a TRANQUILIZER RIFLE from a
text: nearby rack. She hoists it, BACKS AWAY -- full defense mode.
speaker_heading: CASEY
text: EVERYBODY GET OUT! NOW!
text: She STABS the code for the DECON chamber. Hatch OPENS. She
text: leaps inside, except -- she’s the only one. Everyone else
dialog: is going for their SIDEARMS as --
text: Bam--! The Predator MOVES. SNAPS ITS RESTRAINTS like
text: they were paper. RISES from the table, as --
scene_heading: INT. DECON CHAMBER
text: The hatch CLOSES, sealing her in.
scene_heading: PRE-RECORDED VOICE
dialog: Chamber secure. Remove garments.
text: Casey, sweating. FUMBLING at the catches of her Hazmat suit.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Come on, come on...
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LAB - THAT MOMENT
text: SECURITY MEN rush to restrain the Predator, but it SWIPES
text: at them with its talons -- DUCKS, PARRIES.
text: TOSSES them like rag dolls. Speed and stealth, mind-numbing.
scene_heading: INT. DECON CHAMBER - WITH CASEY
text: SEEING THIS -- terrified -- while at the same time
text: desperately trying to DISROBE. Blood SPATTERS the window --
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LAB - SAME
text: THE PREDATOR, rampaging.
text: COLWELL draws a weapon -- but it GRABS HIM by the hair;
text: snags a scalpel in its other talon. Like a samurai --
text: BEHEADS HIM with the scalpel--! The next second, SLICES OFF
text: HIS HAND -- Then BEE-LINES TO THE DECON HATCH...
text: Spoils in hand, PRESSES COLWELL’S HEAD and HAND to
text: the scanners. Then, nightmarishly:
text: MIMICS the dead man’s voice exactly:
speaker_heading: THE PREDATOR
dialog: Colwell, Sean H.
text: A green light BLEEPS. ACCESS GRANTED--!
scene_heading: INT. DECON CHAMBER
text: Skin burn complete, Casey’s scooping up her clothes, as
text: -- the HATCH SHUSHES OPEN behind her. She SPINS, naked -
dialog: - clutching the trang gun. --
text: And there’s THE PREDATOR.
text: Trembling, breathless, Casey LEVELS THE WEAPON. Pulls
text: the trigger: a dry CLICK--! Jammed.
text: The Predator cocks its head at her. Is it... smiling?
text: And then -- it simply MOVES PAST her. SPARING HER. As
text: Casey breathes in short terrified bursts, we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SKY OVER CENTRAL AMERICA - NIGHT
text: THREE F-22 RAPTORS slice the sound barrier -- following
text: the Predator ship’s last known position.
scene_heading: INT. F-22 COCKPIT - FLYING - NIGHT
text: ON THE LEAD PILOT as he checks his instruments. We HEAR:
speaker_heading: RADIO CHATTER
text: Catfish one, approaching vector.
text: Triangulate SAM radar, over.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT
text: THREE TACTICAL MERCS spin round a bend, rifles up. As they
text: clatter past an alcove, two MUSCULAR ARMS SWIPE OUT--!
dialog: 41.
text: GLTCH--GLTCH! TALONS puncturing flesh; severing brain
text: stems. Two down. The remaining merc SPINS, gun up --
text: Predator, weaponless... Fuck it -- SCOOPS A MACHINE GUN
text: IN EACH HAND.
text: BUDDA-BUDDA--! The merc topples. The Predator calmly DROPS
text: the guns, retrieves Colwell’s head and hand from the floor.
scene_heading: INT. DECON CHAMBER
text: Casey finishes pulling on her clothes, notices -- on
text: the floor, splatters of phosphorescent GREEN BLOOD.
text: She looks back into the lab -- at the tranq gun CARTRIDGE
text: on the rack. Then... something arguably more important:
text: The mysterious SPECIMEN VIAL she saw earlier.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - AS BEFORE
text: The Predator approaches a VAULT DOOR; again uses Colwell’s
scene_heading: VISCERA to override security. TOSSES THEM ASIDE and ENTERS:
scene_heading: INT. A HIGH SECURITY VAULT
text: Like a bank vault, but for Predator technology.
text: The Predator RUMMAGES; tossing items aside violently.
text: Plainly looking for something... but not finding it.
text: Frustrated, it GRABS what it knows -- a new WRIST GAUNTLET,
text: a PLASMA CANNON. Finally, snatches up a THIRD object:
text: A bent, scorched BATTLE MASK.
text: With this last, it does an odd thing: lifts the mask to
text: its eyes. With one hand, taps a code on its side, blip-!
scene_heading: POV: THROUGH THE MASK
dialog: We’re seeing what IT is seeing. Here’s the weird part:
text: Wherever it is..? It’s not the room he’s currently IN.
text: Blurry... faulty transmission. Still, oddly FAMILIAR.
text: We’re seeing Rory’s bedroom. WTF? CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RORY’S BASEMENT - SAME TIME
text: THE OTHER MASK, Rory’s -- leaning against the wall, face
text: outward. A green LIGHT blinking, as it transmits --
scene_heading: BACK TO POV - BLURRED
dialog: 42.
text: We see RORY at his bench, back to us... now we SNAP-ZOOM
text: in to a spot on the wall, near the kid’s head:
text: A drawing of a pit bull. Taped there, along with
text: other drawings. In the corner, printed neatly:
scene_heading: RORY DECLAN McKENNA, GRADE 6. GORDON MIDDLE SCHOOL
text: The Predator lowers the mask. Turns, with new purpose. Taps its
text: wrist and... with a glitching SHIMMER, CLOAKS. Vanishing.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND ABOVE - NIGHT
scene_heading: The V.A. bus STOPS, MID-COMPOUND. ALARMS continue to
text: WAIL throughout the facility. SOLDIERS approach --
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Sit tight. There’s been a breech.
scene_heading: INT. V.A. BUS - SAME
text: MCKENNA AND WILLIAMS, apprehensive. What’s going on?
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR
text: Dressed and clutching the tranq rifle, Casey follows a trail
text: of Predator blood to THE STILL-OPEN VAULT -- immediately sees
dialog: it’s been ransacked. What the hell was it looking for?
text: A bleeding MED-TECH stumbles around the corner, sees her:
scene_heading: DYING MED-TECH
dialog: Please... It... it MUSTN’T GET
text: AWAY...
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: It won't.
dialog: (nods grimly)
dialog: Not my space animal.
text: She turns -- sprints out of frame, and meanwhile
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - THE F-22S
text: Flying in formation. PILOTS scanning the horizon.
speaker_heading: RADIO CHATTER
dialog: Catfish one, still no visual, check
dialog: your six two and three, over --
scene_heading: INT. RORY’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - SAME
text: He’s back to his video games. Because of course he is.
dialog: 43.
text: Then... bored, he picks up the Kujhad. PUNCHES IN THE
dialog: CODE from before... just for the hell of it, and --
scene_heading: EXT. SKY OVER CENTRAL AMERICA - NIGHT
text: THE PREDATOR SHIP APPEARS OUT OF NOWHERE -- smack in
dialog: the trajectory of the three Raptor jets!
scene_heading: RADIO VOICE #1 RADIO VOICE #2
dialog: (filtered) (filtered)
dialog: Holy shit! Heads up! Bandit! Three-zero-
dialog: five!
scene_heading: QUICK CUTS -- AS THEY QUICKLY COURSE CORRECT
dialog: Milliseconds before impact --
scene_heading: INT. V.A. VAN - ABANDONED BASE - NIGHT
text: Something outside the bus catches McKenna’s eye:
text: A DARK FIGURE -- emerging from a bunker in the distance. A
text: hulking, lithe, humanoid chameleon shape. Shimmering....
text: McKenna nudges Williams, who squints... the thing FLICKERS;
text: seems to VANISH in mid-stride. Williams stiffens --
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Your little green friend?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Turns invisible?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Goddamn space aliens.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - UP TOP - THAT MOMENT
text: CASEY emerges, into the night. Trang gun at the ready. Comes
text: around the edge of a building, SEES a Predator BLOOD TRAIL --
scene_heading: INT. V.A. BUS - AS BEFORE
text: ALARM KLAXONS wailing outside.
text: McKenna, fraught. Struggling to concoct an escape
text: strategy. Williams sees the look; doesn’t like it.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: (re: Predator)
dialog: That thing killed my men.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Yeah, they’1l do that. Stay on
dialog: the bus.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: What are you, nuts? We gotta move.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Exactly. Stay on the bus.
text: McKenna, thrown. Williams looks at him, sidelong:
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS (CONT’D)
text: It’s a bus.
text: He swivels his head -- a barely perceptible NOD to COYLE.
speaker_heading: COYLE
dialog: (erupts)
dialog: Hey, Baxley! If your mom’s vagina
dialog: was a video game, it’d be rated
dialog: E for everyone!
text: The SECOND MP rattles the cage door with his baton.
speaker_heading: SECOND MP ON BUS
dialog: Knock it off!
speaker_heading: COYLE
dialog: Seriously, what’s the difference
text: between five big black guys and
dialog: a joke?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Baxley’s mom can’t take a joke!
text: Baxley’s out of his seat so fast he’s a blur -- manacles
text: clutched in his fists, he WRAPS THEM AROUND COYLE’S NECK
text: -- choking him--! Coyle GASPS, SPUTTERS.
text: The second MP fumbles with his key ring as the first UNCLIPS
text: HIS SIDEARM, adrenaline spiking. Yells to the prisoners:
speaker_heading: MP ON BUS
dialog: Everyone on the floor, face down!
text: THE OTHERS OBEY; kneel with heads bowed, as --
text: The second MP UNLOCKS THE CAGE DOOR -- GRABS a Remington 870
text: pump action from its mount. Both men RUN up the aisle to:
dialog: 45.
text: BACK OF THE BUS
text: As they pry the two prisoners apart, the first MP reaches
text: for the baton on his belt, except: shit. It’s not there.
text: BECAUSE BAXLEY JUST NABBED IT--! SWINGS IT into the back
text: of the MP’s legs. HE GOES DOWN hard, as --
text: SECOND MP whips the SHOTGUN UP. Barely time to register:
text: COYLE, right in front of him, SHOVES the barrel with his
text: palm so it CLOCKS THE MP in the forehead -- CRACK! --
text: dropping him. Coyle GRABS the shotgun --
text: And TOSSES IT TO WILLIAMS, who SPINS, cocks it -- K-CHUK! -
text: - and levels it at the DRIVER.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Whoopsie.
text: THE DRIVER puts his HANDS UP as Baxley and Coyle -- the best
text: of friends now -- snag the guards’ keys and start unlocking
text: the prisoners’ shackles. A ruse from square one.
text: Shorn of his manacles, Williams takes the DRIVER’S SEAT.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I need that alien.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Don’t think he’1l board the
dialog: bus willingly.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Just get me close.
text: WILLIAMS jerks the bus into gear... and GUNS IT.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - WITH THE PREDATOR
text: As it CLOAKS and DE-CLOAKS itself. One second, it’s
text: there. The next: GONE. Vanished.
text: IT LEAPS, parkour style. Alights on a rooftop, and --
text: Suddenly pauses, EARS PRICKED. It darts a look SKYWARD
dialog: as, without warning --
scene_heading: THE PREDATOR MOTHER SHIP APPEARS
text: Blasts across the sky. Holy shit. Shearing through
text: the atmosphere, and, with even LESS warning --
scene_heading: TWO F-22 FIGHTER JETS -- IN PURSUIT
dialog: 46.
text: Jesus. Flashing through frame, fucking DEAFENING, as
scene_heading: -- WITH THE V.A. BUS
text: It PUNCHES through a fence--! Chain link whipping away --
scene_heading: INT. V.A. BUS - DRIVING
text: WILLIAMS is DRIVING like a mad man, eyes darting between
text: the SPACESHIP and the buildings below. McKENNA yells:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Open the door!!
text: He YANKS the Remington from Williams. Door, HISSING open --
text: MCKENNA DROPS SIDEWAYS
text: On the open steps, sighting up the barrel of the weapon.
text: Cold intent. Everything goes SILENT.
speaker_heading: GUNSIGHT POV
text: And there it is: through his sight, the trademark
text: Predator DISTORTION. Nearing the tree line, CUT TO:
text: CASEY, ON THE RUN
text: Tops a ladder, swings onto rusty metal BRIDGE. High ground.
text: Surveys the compound... bingo. BLOOD TRAIL, 12 o’clock.
text: A sudden RUMBLE, she looks down, SEES:
speaker_heading: THE V.A. BUS
text: THUNDERING UNDER the bridge. She times her jump --
text: DROPS DOWN, ONTO THE ROOF -- thunk!
text: Swivels the TRANQ GUN, targeting the TREE LINE, just as
scene_heading: -- EXT. GROUND LEVEL - THE BUS
text: MCKENNA LEAPS FREE, shotgun tight to his chest. He TUCKS AND
text: ROLLS. Comes up, GETS OFF TWO SHOTS -- too little, too late --
scene_heading: THE PREDATOR VANISHES
text: Over the perimeter wall. As an afterthought, the creature
text: lashes out: SEVERS a LIGHT POLE -- it CRUMPLES DOWNWARD --
scene_heading: INT. V.A. SHUTTLE
text: WILLIAMS SEES the obstacle. Shit! STANDS ON THE BRAKES --
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: THE BUS
text: COLLIDES with the massive pole, tires BLOWN, as
scene_heading: -- ON THE ROOF - CASEY
text: Loses her footing; TOPPLES backward. Still clutching the
text: trang gun, she squeezes the trigger involuntarily, and --
text: THPPP--! A DART imbeds itself in her foot. She ROLLS OFF
text: the top of the bus like a string-cut marionette, as --
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - SAME
text: McKenna sees her pitch off the side, SCRAMBLES TO catch her.
text: Then quickly registers the ARMED SECURITY MEN moving in
text: from all sides, and hastily (comically) FLEES just as --
text: WHOMP--! Casey LANDS on the ground with an ugly KLUD! She
text: ROLLS OVER; groggy. So much for Prince fucking Charming.
speaker_heading: AT THE BUS
text: The others SCRAMBLE OUT, as NEBRASKA WILLIAMS spots:
text: A small, open Quonset hut with a column of vintage,
text: army green HARLEY MOTORCYCLES. He yells:
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
text: Get to the choppers.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - AT THE BUS
text: One of the MERCS sees Casey, on the ground: he taps a
text: switch on his VIDEO HEADSET -- CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LAB (UNDERGROUND) - AS BEFORE
text: TRAEGER has his own glass-like headset with THE MERC’S POV:
speaker_heading: SHOOTER (O.S.)

dialog: Sir..?
text: Traeger sighs, deep regret:
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: No witnesses.
scene_heading: EXT. COMPOUND - BACK UP TOP
text: The MERC, about to follow orders when a BURBLING ROAR
dialog: fills the air, and --
dialog: 48.
text: McKENNA COMES OVER THE TOP
text: AIRBORNE on his howling HARLEY. Launches off an embankment.
text: FIRES MID-AIR, blam-blam-! takes out the dude’s LEGS.
text: Lands. Fishtails madly -- steers toward Casey; pure
scene_heading: Steve McQueen. SCOOPS HER UP --
text: And here come THE LOONIES; Williams in the lead! A phalanx
dialog: of crazy-ass Hell’s Angels.
text: The recovering mercs OPEN FIRE -- as the cycles
text: BLAST FORWARD, out of the compound, as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SKY OVER TEXAS - THAT MOMENT
text: THE F-22S FLY alongside and above the NOW-VISIBLE

scene_heading: ON THE LEAD PILOT (INTERCUT:
speaker_heading: RADIO CHATTER
dialog: Go, zero-two! Go zero-three!
text: AIR-TO-AIR MISSILES spew from the Raptors, and RIP ACROSS the

scene_heading: EXT. SKY OVER TEXAS - THE AERIAL PURSUIT
text: THE F-22s BANK OFF as the PREDATOR SHIP TUMBLES, smoking.
text: A glitching SHIMMER as it manages to CLOAK itself one
text: final time... seconds before it impacts --
dialog: And now, an odd sight -- one we hinted at in our opening:
text: An INVISIBLE CRASH. The leafy canopy EXPLODES, then
text: a careening DEBRIS FIELD forming before our eyes --
text: All that’s missing is the ship that’s CAUSING IT.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CRASH SITE - NIGHT
text: Tendrils of vapor rise, and...
scene_heading: INT. PREDATOR SHIP - SAME
text: Amidst choking smoke, the UPGRADE rises from its seat.
text: Touches a switch, and A PANEL OPENS, revealing a dank,
text: cramped COMPARTMENT. Inside, barely glimpsed --
text: The eerie silhouettes of TWO slobbering, four-
text: legged CREATURES... Whoa. CUT TO:
dialog: 49,
scene_heading: INT. RORY’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rory lies in bed. Wide awake. Peering into a tiny
text: KEYCHAIN VIEWER with a light in it:
text: A PHOTO -- Father and son in happier times. RORY sighs.
text: Rolls over. Turns on his bedside table lamp --
text: And there, on the nightstand, is THE KUJHAD.
text: The BIOHELMET sits beside it; eerie, beckoning. Rory
text: reaches for the Kujhad, but it’s no longer blinking.
dialog: Shit.
text: He THUMBS buttons to wake it up. Nothing at first. Then... it
text: GLOWS RED. Success! Rory chews his lip, thinking. What next?
text: And then he learns the meaning of the phrase, “Be
dialog: careful what you wish for.” Because suddenly:
text: SHAPES, moving in his peripheral vision. He looks up. GASPS --
scene_heading: GIANT, MULTI-EYES SPIDERS
text: Crawling on the walls and ceiling. Out of nowhere. All
text: around him/ Terrified, Rory starts to hyperventilate.
text: He STABS BUTTONS in a desperate bid to make them go away --
text: Then notices: the spiders are GLITCHING with
dialog: electronic distortion. He double-takes, SEES --
text: MONOFILAMENTS OF LIGHT emanating from the biohelmet...
dialog: it’s the source of the images. Not just images:
scene_heading: HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTIONS.
text: He picks up the helmet, lifts it to his face and...
speaker_heading: BIOHELMET POV (INTERCUT:
text: Like police video, the spiders are PRE-RECORDED IMAGES OF
text: A PREDATOR HUNT ON ANOTHER WORLD.
text: At his fingertips is A VIRTUAL DOCUMENT of the
text: Predators’ travels across the galaxy.
text: He pulls the mask away, a stew of various IMAGES projected
text: IN 3D all around him. Including something he didn’t expect:
text: What appears to be A MAP.
dialog: 50.
text: At its center, a highlighted, ALIEN SHAPE. Blinking. A
text: beacon, a marker? Or maybe, just maybe...? A transponder.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RURAL MOTEL - NIGHT
text: NEBRASKA WILLIAMS smokes a cigarette in the blinking neon
text: of the motel sign. He hears A SCUFFLE, turns to SEE:

speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Nettles.
dialog: (nods to motel room)
text: There’s a toilet in the room.
text: Nettles eyes widen, like he’s just seen God.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: A staccato KNOCK on the door (a code). FLYBOY opens it,

text: CASEY’s in the bed, sleeping off the tranquilizer dart --
text: THE REST OF THE VETS gathered around. McKenna, weary, Says:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Don’t any of you guys
dialog: have someplace to be?

speaker_heading: BAXLEY

speaker_heading: COYLE

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Point taken.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: So now what, chief? Your green

speaker_heading: BAXLEY
dialog: I’m tellin’ you -- TV news, bro.
dialog: They’1l have to believe you.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Right. And I have some land
dialog: in Florida to sell you.
speaker_heading: BAXLEY
dialog: Just get somebody credible. Like
dialog: Channel 9. What’s-her-name, the
dialog: lady with the big heinie --
speaker_heading: COYLE
dialog: Fool, she’s the meteorologist.
speaker_heading: BAXLEY
dialog: She is?
speaker_heading: NETTLES
dialog: (chiming in)
dialog: He’s right -- one look at her
dialog: and you can tell whether.
text: The others trade looks -- what does that even mean? Then:
speaker_heading: BAXLEY
dialog: If we can get someone to listen --
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: And if ‘if’s and buts’ were
dialog: candy and nuts, we’d all have a

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I love waking to the sound of
dialog: macho bullshit.
text: She grimaces. Fumbles out her CELL PHONE -- Incredibly,
text: McKenna GRABS the shotgun, COCKS IT: Is he gonna shoot her?
text: No. He GRABS THE PHONE, shoves it under a pillow, and -- a
text: muted BOOM--! The pillow’s a smoking ruin. PHONE, vanquished.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: (stunned disbelief)
dialog: Are you crazy--?
text: A beat. Then a SMALL CHORUS:
speaker_heading: THE LOONIES
dialog: Maybe. A little. I dunno,

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Don’t be stupid.

speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: They tried to put a bullet in

dialog: (eyes smouldering)
dialog: You’re expendable. Just like
dialog: the rest of us.
text: That STOPS her. She exhales. Looks round at the “unit” --
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Expendables, huh? More like the
dialog: Seven fucking Dwarfs.
text: Nettles grins bashfully -- Casey sighs.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: Can I borrow a phone, at least?
dialog: I need someone to feed my dogs.
text: She flops in a chair. Gazes up at McKenna.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: You saw it first, didn’t you?
dialog: The Predator?
dialog: (off his quizzical look)
dialog: I read the file. Those men it
dialog: killed -- yours?
dialog: 53.
text: McKenna nods, grim.
dialog: McKenna’s
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: I figured. You may as well have

text: eyes blaze. She shrugs:
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m just telling you what’s in
dialog: the file.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: It said “flaky?”
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That was an unfortunate
dialog: embellishment. Can we move on?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (joining in)
dialog: We can start with what you were
text: doing at a supposedly abandoned

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I’m an evolutionary biologist. I
dialog: was on call in case of... you

text: McKenna thinks it over, paces. Stops, exhales raggedly...
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: If we wanna keep breathin’, we
dialog: gotta find this thing. Expose
dialog: it. We all agreed?
text: A look goes round. A bonding moment... exiles, all;
dialog: perfect scapegoats. No none will miss them.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Good. First things first. What
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: The Predator? Well...
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: It has human DNA, for one thing.
text: The loonies react. WHAT?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s not all. I was there when

dialog: looking for something.
text: McKenna goes pale with realization.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
text: Its equipment.
text: He looks up -- realizes all eyes are on him.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: I took it. So I’d have

dialog: I... I think I know where

text: Pause. Nettles clears his throat:

speaker_heading: PERVERT (ON THE TV)

scene_heading: CHRIS HANSEN (ON THE TV)
dialog: I see you brought some condoms and
dialog: some Mike’s Hard Lemonade.
text: There’s a RAP on the door, and Cutter ROLLS himself the

text: opens up enough to see a sliver of a face:
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Gunny.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Well, if it ain’t Nebraska
dialog: Williams.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Just wonderin’ how’d you feel
dialog: about a little recon mission...
text: Cutter peers through the crack in the door, SEEING:
text: THE GROUP OF LOONIES in the moonlight. McKenna. The others.
text: The very uncomfortable, but equally appealing... CASEY.
text: Behind him: dirty laundry. Take-out containers. A cat YOWLS.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Let me check my schedule.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT (RORY’S HOUSE) - EVENING
text: Rory, in his “Control Area” wearing the Frankenstein mask
text: his mom bought him. He pulls it off, frowning. Lame.
text: Then -- a scuffling SOUND at the basement window. He turns to
dialog: SEE what appears to be...
scene_heading: A LARGE, FOUR-LEGGED ANIMAL
text: SNIFFING at the window. The neighbor’s pit bull...?
text: It disappears -- he doesn’t pay it much mind.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: EMILY does the dishes -- oblivious as RORY, clutching
text: something, furtively heads out the back door BEHIND HER.
text: PRE-LAP: the SOUND OF A DOORBELL RINGING, and --
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT ENTRY - NIGHT (LATER)
text: Emily opens the door to reveal: TRAEGER, flanked by
text: armed SECURITY MEN.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Mrs. McKenna?
dialog: (flashes his ID)
dialog: Can we have a word?
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE (INTERCUT:)
text: REVEAL MCKENNA and the rest of the vets, HIDDEN IN THE BUSHES
text: with field glasses and talkies. Williams aims A SHOTGUN MIKE
text: at the house, allows them to hear the conversation:
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Let me guess: he’s done
dialog: something crazy.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Why would you guess that..?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Because the look on your face
dialog: says he’s not dead, and yet here
dialog: you fucking are.
text: STEVENS notices a locked GUN CASE in the adjoining study.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT! D)
dialog: Those are his. He’s a hunter.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Look, I haven’t seen Quinn for
text: a year. He’s on assignment.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: How about your son -- where is he?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Around here somewhere. Why?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Mind if we speak with him?
scene_heading: INT. THE BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Traeger and the security men come down the stairs,
text: finding Rory’s lair... but the kid? Nowhere to be seen.
speaker_heading: RORY’S MOM
dialog: That’s weird. If he’s not in his
dialog: room, he’s always here. He said he
dialog: was going trick-or-treating, but...
dialog: 57.
text: She frowns. SEES the two discarded costumes on his
text: work table. Why would he leave without his costume?
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT
text: RORY timidly roams the neighborhood, surrounded by
text: costumed trick-or-treaters and their parents.
text: His head, ENCASED IN THE PREDATOR’S BIOHELMET.
text: The KUJHAD, clutched by his side. Swell costume.
text: Navigating’s a bit tricky, he stumbles a little --
text: RORY’S POV: Human HEAT SIGNATURES. Every direction.
scene_heading: INT. WINNEBAGO (NEAR RORY’S HOUSE) - NIGHT
text: CUTTER at the wheel, taking watch. At the NOOK in back, CASEY
text: squints into a microscope. Murmurs, under her breath --
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: It’s like a supermatrix of
dialog: tryhydroxy and amino acids...
text: She pulls back from the lens. Blinks, incredulous:
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
text: With evidence of recombinant
dialog: gene splicing.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: What’s that mean?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: If I’m right..? It means they’re
text: trying to upgrade themselves.
text: She picks up a TALKIE, keys it:
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: McKenna? I’ve found something.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE RORY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: McKenna’s TALKIE SQUELCHES -- he quickly turns it down.
text: Then he freezes -- notices something in the shadows:
text: THAT “DOG” FROM EARLIER. Sniffing at the basement windows.
scene_heading: INT. RORY’S HOUSE - SAME
text: Inside, Traeger ALSO hears it. Stops, looks toward the back
text: of the house. Nods to TWO OF HIS MEN to check it out --
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - SAME
text: TRAEGER’S MEN EMERGE from the house and fan out.
text: WITH ONE OF THE SECURITY MEN
text: Flashlight up. He catches a glimpse of “the dog” as it
text: pads away into the brush. Keys his talkie:
speaker_heading: SECURITY DETAIL
dialog: I’m on it. Triangulate on
dialog: my signal.
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - NIGHT
text: The Security Man SLAPS a bug from his cheek. Then, a
text: GRUNTING SOUND from nearby. He WHIPS HIS FLASHLIGHT ONTO --
speaker_heading: AN ARMADILLO
text: Foraging in a pile of garbage. It looks up, beady-eyed --
speaker_heading: SECURITY DETAIL
dialog: (CONT’D) You scared the shit out
dialog: of me, you little walking helmet.
text: Which is when -- the armadillo SCREAMS (yes, they do that).
text: It’s looking past the Security Man, who HEARS a throaty
text: CLICKING SOUND behind him, and SPINS, face-to-face with:
dialog: 
text: ONE OF THE FOUR-LEGGED CREATURES from the ship!
text: Yellow, albino eyes. MANDIBLES. The man turns to RUN --
text: BUT HE’S BLOCKED by the SECOND CREATURE!
scene_heading: QUICK CUTS - SAVAGE, MERCILESS
text: Strangled screams. IMPOTENT GUNSHOTS shatter the
dialog: suburban stillness as --
scene_heading: EXT. RORY’S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT
text: TRAEGER bursts from the back door with his remaining Security
text: Man. They RUSH in the direction of the screams and gunshots --
scene_heading: MOVING WITH TRAEGER
text: He stumbles to a mute halt, SEEING:
text: THE FIRST OF HIS MEN, splayed inside-out. The other
text: one, nearby. Similarly crimson.
dialog: 59.
text: Traeger registers alarm, but oddly, not much surprise.
text: He keys his talkie:
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Team Edward to Team Jacob.
dialog: Secure the perimeter.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - SAME
text: MCKENNA AND THE MEN, guns up. CASEY joins them, GRABS a
text: pair of night-vision binocs to SEE:
scene_heading: THE TWO PREDATOR HYBRIDS
text: Retreating into the night. She swallows; adrenaline pumping.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: (catches her
dialog: breath) They’re dogs.
text: McKenna looks at her like she has antlers.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: The Predators -- they’re
dialog: hunters, get it?
text: A mordant grin, despite herself:
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: They brought their fucking dogs.
scene_heading: INT. RORY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: McKenna SLAMS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR, finds himself face
text: to face with Emily -- HIS WIFE. Stone-faced:
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Hi, honey, you’re home.
text: An awkward moment -- then she clocks the shotgun in his hand.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Where’s Rory?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh, I get it. You think you
dialog: can just waltz in here and --
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I asked you a question.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (calling upstairs
dialog: Agent Traeger, he’s down here!!
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Nice try.
dialog: (taps earbud)
dialog: I was listening. Oh, and “What’s he
dialog: done now?” Thanks for that.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What was I supposed to say?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: How about, “My ex-husband -- is
dialog: my he all right?”
text: This catches her off-guard.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I thought you... hit bottom.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Not yet. But hey, the
dialog: night’s young.
dialog: (repeats)
dialog: Where’s our son?
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: McKenna bee-lines to Rory’s “Control Area,” SEES THE

speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’D)
dialog: Shit -- !
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (on the stairs)
dialog: What? He ordered some video games.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: No no no no...
text: McKenna rifles through Rory’s stuffs for any trace of
text: the alien tech.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: The whole fucking reason I sent it
dialog: to a P.O. box was so I wouldn’t put
dialog: you in danger! Goddammit.
dialog: (turns to her)
dialog: We need to find him -- NOW.
text: He BOLTS, heading upstairs again --
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Quinn, you’re scaring me.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - FIRST FLOOR
text: Back the way they came. McKenna tosses over his shoulder:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: So you let him order any
dialog: video games he wants?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I specifically said -- no first
text: person shooters, no combat games.
dialog: You don’t even check, do you?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Whatever. He has, like, THREE.
dialog: Jesus--
text: He turns on her.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
speaker_heading: THREE?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yes. And did you ever think that
dialog: maybe he plays them to connect
dialog: with his father??
dialog: (catches herself
dialog: Oh my God, we’re doing this.
dialog: She STOPS. Sees:
text: THE LOONIES, gathered in her living room. A comical moment
text: as they grin stupidly. Sheepish waves.
text: McKenna, meanwhile: snatching PHOTOS OF RORY from
text: walls, tables. School portraits, holiday pics --
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: What are you doing? Give me those!
dialog: (to McKenna, re: Loonies)
dialog: Who are these people?!
text: He calmly takes the pictures from her.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: They’re my unit. They’re soldiers.
text: She blinks, incredulous:
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: They look like ushers at a
dialog: porno theater.
dialog: (to Williams)
dialog: No offense.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (to McKenna)
dialog: The wife..?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: For better or worse.
dialog: (waves a hand)
dialog: Emily? Loonies. Loonies? Emily.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Wait, back up -- your
dialog: unit? (frowns)
dialog: What happened to Haines..? Dupree?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: They’re dead.
dialog: (deep breath)
dialog: And the thing that killed them is
dialog: looking for Rory. SO. You can
dialog: think I’m crazy all you want --
text: He looks her dead in the eye:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: But right now? Our son is ina
dialog: kill box.
text: He turns to the Loonies:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: I want a grid search. Three teams.
text: He gives the first picture to Williams.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: (CONT’D) You go west.
dialog: (another picture for
dialog: Baxley and Coyle)
dialog: You two, east.
dialog: (one for Nettles
dialog: and Flyboy)
text: Up the middle.
text: He turns to Emily -- who’s shrugging into her COAT. Snatching
text: up, of all things, a FIREPLACE POKER. He GRABS IT away --
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What are you doing? Our son’s
dialog: in danger!
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: That’s right, and last time
dialog: I looked -- ?
dialog: (hefts his GUN)
dialog: This is match grade.
speaker_heading: (the POKER)
dialog: This, not so much. But points
dialog: for originality.
dialog: 
text: He turns to the Loonies:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Objective area’s eight square

dialog: Find my son.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE RORY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: WILLIAMS AND THE LOONIES split up with military precision;

speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: They’ re gonna come back, and
dialog: they’re gonna ask questions.
dialog: All that matters is our boy.
dialog: (hands her a phone)
dialog: This is a burner, I’11l call you.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I don’t like what you do, Quinn.
dialog: I never did.
dialog: (grudging)
dialog: But watching you do it--?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Turns you on, doesn’t it?
text: A warm look between them; a history of good and bad

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Get out of here before I open
dialog: that gun case.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER STREET - SUBURBS - NIGHT

scene_heading: OFF-SCREEN VOICE
dialog: Hey, Ass-Burger!
text: Oh, Christ. IT’S E.J. -- the bully from school. Rory turns
text: to go the other way. Finds himself boxed in by:
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: What’re you supposed to be?
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Leave me alone.
dialog: E.J.
dialog: Or what -- ? You’ll wash your

text: Rory hurries away. The bullies dog his heels, chuckling
scene_heading: -- EXT. A CREEPY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Patchy lawn. Porch light OFF. The least inviting house
text: on this or any block. Possible escape..? Rory heads up
text: the steps. Looks back --
speaker_heading: THE BULLIES
text: On the sidewalk, smirking. No turning back now. Gulp. He
text: RINGS the doorbell. A BUZZ echoes from deep inside...
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: trick or treat..?
text: A VOICE from behind the door:
speaker_heading: STONER’S VOICE
dialog: Fuck off.
text: ON THE SIDEWALK -- E.J. and Derek CHORTLE with amusement.
text: Taking the hint, Rory turns. Moves stiffly toward the street.
text: A door CREAKS OPEN behind him, and...
text: An unfriendly looking STONER appears in the darkened doorway.
speaker_heading: STONER
dialog: Here’s a treat, you little shit.
text: He PITCHES SOMETHING through the air -- Splat! A ROTTEN APPLE
text: SMACKS Rory in the back of the head. Bullies, laughing...
text: The reaction is shockingly swift and
scene_heading: spontaneous. PREDATOR MASK POV
dialog: 65.
text: The interior of the helmet LIGHTS UP. Symbols, scrolling.
text: TARGETING INFORMATION. A tiny PLASMA-CASTER juts forth --
text: UNLEASHES HELLFIRE.
scene_heading: ON THE PORCH - THE STONER
text: is literally DISINTEGRATED as the doorway BLOWS OUT
dialog: ALL AROUND HIM -- !
scene_heading: EXT. A BLOCK AWAY - McKENNA AND CASEY

scene_heading: EXT. STONER’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The front lawn, SMOKING. Rory turns toward the slack-
text: jawed bullies, his face the imposing PREDATOR BIOHELMET.
text: The bullies almost shit their pants before FLEEING in abject

scene_heading: POLICE CRUISER, INBOUND

speaker_heading: ROOKIE COP
dialog: Freeze!
text: But Rory panics, RUNS --
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY - RORY, HAULING ASS

scene_heading: EXT. STONER’S HOUSE - SAME
text: More POLICE CRUISERS, BLOWING INTO FRAME.
text: They jolt to a stop, just in time to see the ROOKIE COP come

dialog: Where’s my fucking car?
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - FLASHERS TURNING

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: RORY, RUNNING
text: Between houses, terrified, THE KUJHAD clutched in his
text: sweaty hand -- the very thing the Predator’s after.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JIM & JOHN’S BAR-B-Q - NIGHT
text: RORY rounds a bend. STOPS in his tracks, path blocked by --
text: Christ. It’s that fucking PIT BULL -- the one that taunts
text: him on the way home from school. The dog GROWLS. Primal.
text: Then, oddly -- moves RIGHT UP TO RORY. Stops beside him.
text: Rory’s brow furrows with confusion... Then, a decision.
text: He reaches out, tentatively... to pet the dog?
dialog: 67.
text: The dog doesn’t flinch. Their eyes meet. A sweet, unspoken
dialog: recognition that they’re not all that different: two earth
text: creatures, just trying to get by.
text: Then the dog FREEZES. A throaty GROWL as it backs away
text: from something OFF-SCREEN, and Rory TURNS TO SEE:
scene_heading: ONE OF THE PREDATOR DOGS
text: Snarling. Vicious. Rory gapes, thunderstruck --
text: Now the OTHER PREDATOR DOG appears! Thinking quickly:
text: Rory STABS BUTTONS on the KUJHAD, and with that --
dialog: 
text: OTHERWORLDLY CREATURES APPEAR.
text: HOLOGRAMS. The Predator dogs RETREAT, fearful. Nice
text: job, Rory. Until the images FLICKER, and FADE. Damn!
text: The sniffers turn toward Rory -- but just then, A VOICE
dialog: from off-screen:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Son!
text: AND THERE’S HIS DAD, shotgun in hand. McKenna cocks and
text: FIRES at the sniffers -- K-CHUK-BLAMM! K-CHUK-BLAMM!
text: BUT THE SNIFFERS JUST KEEP COMING.
text: A SQUAD CAR SCREAMS into the parking lot and -- WILLIAMS
text: ROLLS OUT onto the pavement before the car’s even stopped.
dialog: Levels the grenade
dialog: launcher. Click--!
text: Nothing. Fucking thing’s jammed. As he struggles to fix
text: it, the OTHER VETS MOVE IN, loaded for bear. OPEN FIRE on
text: the Predator Dogs. A HAIL STORM OF ARTILLERY--!
text: The Sniffers barely flinch. Just KEEP -- MOVING -- FORWARD.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Um, Gaylord?
text: Williams finishes a final adjustment on the launcher --
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: I thought I told you --
text: -- then THROWS IT into McKenna’s waiting hands.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (CONT’D) Call me Nebraska.
dialog: 68.
text: McKenna SPINS.
text: WHOMMM--! FIRES A 40MM RECOILLESS GRENADE down the Predator
text: dog’s throat. A muted FWHHMPP! from within, and --
text: The creature BUCKLES. Punch-drunk. Finally topples as...
text: THE SECOND SNIFFER crouches to attack. But that’s
text: when Williams steps forward, a BOLT GUN in hand.
text: He levels it at the creature -- FIRES, AND
text: THE BOLT impales the creature’s forehead. It wavers. Lists.
text: Walks in a lazy circle. Not dead but... no longer a threat.
text: Nebraska Williams mutters ruefully:
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS (CONT’D)
dialog: Goddamn space aliens.
text: But his triumph is short-lived as he looks to THE POLICE
text: CAR he stole: because standing on top, bathed in the
text: strobing colors of the lightbar is...
scene_heading: THE PREDATOR.
text: It STOMPS down the hood of the car, on a bee-line for Rory.
text: McKenna pumps the shotgun, unloads: BLAM--! But the
text: thing KEEPS RIGHT ON COMING.
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT
text: Baxley at the wheel. He GUNS IT -- SLAMS into the
text: Predator from behind at high speed!
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME
text: Alas, nothing. The front fender is dented, but the
text: Predator? Just glowers at Baxley like it’s irked. Then --
text: CONTINUES TOWARD RORY... CASEY appears, CALLS out to McKenna:
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That thing in his hand! THAT’S
dialog: WHAT IT WANTS--!
text: MCKENNA RUNS -- grapples to wrest the device away from
text: his son. But as always -- THE PREDATOR’S FASTER.
text: The Creature GRABS McKENNA! SLAMS HIM, hard, into an
text: old, neon “Jim & John’s” sign! It CRACKS and SPARKS--!
dialog: 69.
dialog: And just as we consider saying good-bye to our lead,
text: McKenna watches, stunned, as the Predator THUMBS A BUTTON
text: on its wrist gauntlet and, believe it or not, TALKS:
text: Guttural. Alien-sounding. But ENGLISH:
speaker_heading: GOOD PREDATOR
dialog: Coming... for me... Run...
text: Then -- a throaty CLICKING SOUND. From off-screen.
text: The Predator turns to look. Stiffens; replies, that selfsame
text: CLICKING. Defensive. Like two cats YOWLING at each other.
text: The remaining alien DOG pricks up its ears -- looking back
text: toward the approach of its owner... its MASTER....
text: At which point, McKenna and the others turn TO SEE:
scene_heading: A MASSIVE SILHOUETTE
text: EMERGING from the darkness. Rising up --
text: On first viewing, it very much resembles the iconic PREDATOR.
text: It seems, if anything, more HUMAN than prior versions.
text: McKENNA stands, blinking. Because this new,
text: upgraded Predator? It’s HUGE. TEN FEET TALL.
text: With a SHRIEK, THE WINNEBAGO slews into the parking
text: lot, Cutter at the wheel.
scene_heading: INT. WINNEBAGO - ON CUTTER
text: as he catches his first glimpse of THE UPGRADE.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
text: Baby Jesus on a pony.
dialog: Which is when:
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: THE GOOD PREDATOR RELEASES MCKENNA; raises its PLASMA
text: CANNON-- and TRIGGERS A WITHERING BLAST at the Upgrade--!
dialog: 
text: Then another. And ANOTHER..! Nothing. Bupkis. Spit wads.
text: Because this new, UPGRADED Predator? Doesn’t need armor.
text: Its body, its skin -- IS armor.
scene_heading: RORY, MEANWHILE
text: Stock still. In shock. McKenna approaches --
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Rory? Come on.
text: Rory doesn’t budge.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Son? We have to go. RIGHT...
text: FUCKING... NOW...
text: No time for negotiations, McKenna PICKS UP HIS SON,
text: backing slowly toward
speaker_heading: THE WINNEBAGO
text: Where Cutter is frozen, gripping the wheel. McKenna and
text: the others board the vehicle slowly; no sudden movements.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: How fast does this thing go?
text: Cutter can’t tear his away eyes from the upgrade.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: Not fast enough.
scene_heading: WITH THE PREDATORS (INTERCUT:
text: As the GOOD PREDATOR MOVES! As if to engage the upgrade --
dialog: to take him on. But that’s what’s scary. Because we thought
text: our INITIAL Predator was a big deal. Invincible. But this??
text: As Cutter STOMPS the gas, the UPGRADE PREDATOR WHIPS AROUND
text: -- COLLARS the smaller Predator -- HEFTS it --
text: LITERALLY TEARS IT APART BEFORE OUR EYES.
dialog: 
text: WRENCHES its spine loose -- RAISES ITS BLOOD-SLICKED TROPHY
text: to the full moon. Emits a primal, blood-chilling SHRIEK.
text: It spins toward the Winnebago -- turns its eyes on us
text: full blast -- and that’s when we see it. REALLY see it:
dialog: The EYES. They’ve... evolved. Human-looking.
scene_heading: INT. WINNEBAGO - THAT MOMENT
text: Cutter GUNS IT--! and we INTERCUT:
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBS - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT
text: as the Winnebago SCREAMS along, SWERVING, clipping parked
text: cars -- OUR PRINCIPALS gawking out the windows at:
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: EERIE GLIMPSES
text: of THE UPGRADE, in pursuit -- darting, leaping --
text: SPRINTING through the shadows alongside the SPEEDING RV.
text: Speed, agility? Terrifying. The term “Predator” redefined.
scene_heading: INT. WINNEBAGO - DRIVING
text: CASEY, apoplectic, points at THE KUJHAD Rory’s still holding.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Goddammit, McKenna, that’s what
dialog: it wants! That thing!
text: A massive CRUNCH! as the huge vehicle JARS VIOLENTLY.
text: It’s trying to get in.
text: RORY’s curled up in a fetal ball. Not a fire alarm this time,
text: but rather, CRIPPLING FEAR that’s triggered his shutdown.
dialog: And the Predator device--?
text: He’s clutching it, as if for dear life.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: For Christ’s sake, GIVE IT TO HIM
dialog: OR WE’RE ALL DEAD!
text: McKenna knows she’s right. And with sudden, terrifying force,
text: violently PRIES HIS SON’S FIST OPEN to wrench it free--!
text: Rory YELPS with pain and surprise as McKenna HURLS THE KUJHAD
dialog: OUT an open window -- !
text: EVERYONE squints out the back of the Winnebago, glimpsing:
speaker_heading: THE UPGRADE
text: as it scrambles for THE KUJHAD, and... SNAPS IT into the slot
text: on ITS OWN wrist gauntlet.
text: A last nightmarish glance at our escaping heroes -- then it
text: DISAPPEARS into the night...
scene_heading: INT. WINNEBAGO - DRIVING - NIGHT
text: The group just stares blankly, speechless. The only
text: sound, the rhythmic RATTLE of the RV’s Chevy 454 engine.
text: RORY winces, hands shaking. Afraid to look at McKenna. Less
text: terrified of the Predator than the violence inflicted by
text: his father. He HEARS BARKING, and --
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: OUT THE WINDOW - THE PIT BULL
text: Now maybe Rory’s only friend, chasing the Winnebago
text: and BARKING into the night... CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JIM AND JOHN’S BAR-B-Q- NIGHT
text: TRAEGER stands over the gnarled remains of the “good”
text: Predator. POLICE and FBI VEHICLES form a perimeter.
text: With trembling hand, he clutches a cell phone, says:
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Traeger here. The asset’s dead.
scene_heading: INTERCUT: INT. DARK GOVERNMENT FACILITY (AREA 52)
text: A stocky, four-star GENERAL, on the phone. Square-jawed,
text: with vaguely malevolent, dark eyes. This is WOODHURST, 66.
speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: Explain.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: There’s a new player, sir. Our
dialog: nightmare scenario. The
dialog: genetics are... unprecedented.
speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: An upgrade?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Affirmative. Pulled our asset
text: apart like a piece of taffy.
speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: Jesus...
dialog: (ice cold)
dialog: You spooks over at Stargazer --
dialog: you were going to tell me you had
dialog: an asset in captivity, weren’t
dialog: you..? Funny how I was only
text: notified once it had escaped.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Of course, sir. It had only been
dialog: 72 hours, we were ascertaining --
speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Sir, I --
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Lies are wasted speech. You cross
dialog: me again, I won’t just kill you,
dialog: I’1l1 sell tickets. Understood?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Understood... General.
speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: The asset brought something to
dialog: earth. Something it wasn’t
dialog: supposed to have. Find it. Then
dialog: bring it to me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OAK GROVE - NIGHTTIME
text: Very late now. The WINNEBAGO, cached in a grove of TREES.
text: Crickets chirrup, peaceful... a breather, in other words.
text: McKENNA’s perched in a TREE. On watch. Glances down at:
text: RORY, huddled among the loonies, drawing in the dirt with
text: a stick.
text: The poor kid’s shivering; barely holding it together.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON DIRT
text: We see what he’s absently etching with his stick, oblivious
text: -- it’s a crude MAP. And: we’ve seen it before... CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RORY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: And a RINGING cell phone -- the burner McKenna gave
text: Emily. Frantic with worry, she GRABS IT! HEARS:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA’S PHONE
speaker_heading: VOICE (filtered)
dialog: It’s me.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Please tell me he’s okay.
scene_heading: EXT. OAK TREE - NIGHT (INTERCUT:)
text: McKenna, on the ground now, clutching a cell phone.
text: Williams, having a smoke nearby.
dialog: 74,
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: He’s fine, he’s with me. I’1l1
dialog: bring him home when it’s --
text: Emily’s eyes flicker off-screen, uneasy.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: It’s okay, you don’t have to
dialog: explain. Listen -- remember
dialog: our first date..?
text: McKenna, baffled.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: That night in Buckhead?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Exactly.
text: And with that, she hangs up. No explanation. McKenna
text: frowns. WIF? Williams looks at him, quizzical.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: “Night in Buckhead?”
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: (nods; remembering)
dialog: Yeah... we were going at it in
dialog: my Trans Am that night, and --
text: Sudden realization.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: cops were watching us...
scene_heading: INT. RORY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - REVEALING
text: His ex is, indeed, SURROUNDED BY BLACK OPS TECHNICIANS
text: with surveillance equipment. Before they can stops her:
text: Emily POPS the phone’s SIM card, DROPS It into the sink’s
text: garbage disposal -- flicks on the water and the disposal.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You guys fucked with the
dialog: wrong family.
scene_heading: EXT. OAK GROVE - SAME
text: THE LOONIES are now climbing on and around the Winnebago,
text: stretching camouflage netting over it. RORY watches.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: I don’t think that’s gonna work.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: BAXLEY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Wrong colors, wrong pattern.
dialog: They’11 find us.
text: McKenna appears behind him. Puts a hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I think they know what
dialog: they’ re doing.
text: Rory FLINCHES at the touch, and McKenna quickly withdraws...
scene_heading: EXT. IN THE WOODS
text: NETTLES walks the perimeter, armed. Suddenly -- a
text: familiar, blood-chilling CLICKING--! HE WHIPS around.
text: But nothing. Shrubs. Dirt. Sudden SILENCE.
text: Then -- THE CLICKING’S CLOSER! Nettles SPINS -- A FLASH OF
text: THE PREDATOR DOG’S FACE fills the frame, as...
scene_heading: EXT. GROVE - BACK TO SCENE
text: McKenna and Rory, sitting side by side. Awkward.
text: To break the tension, McKenna fishes in a pocket, produces a
text: set of DOG TAGS. He hands them to Rory, who fingers them:
scene_heading: COLLETT, RORY T.
speaker_heading: AIR FORCE 13006929
text: The kid looks at his dad, confused.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Friend of mine. From...
text: An involuntary glance at the TEETH MARKS on his hand.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: from a long time ago.
text: Rory clutches the odd gift; oblivious to its significance.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Weird, us having the same name.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Funny, huh?
dialog: 76.
dialog: Pause... then:
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Mom says... you’re a killer.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I’m a soldier.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: What’s the difference..?
text: Good question. McKenna looks at his son.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: When you like it -- that’s
dialog: when you’re a killer.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Mom likes killing spiders.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I hate spiders.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: This is the most we’ve talked.
text: Pause... almost companionable. Then:
speaker_heading: RORY (CONT’D)
dialog: I think it was a good guy.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: (bewildered)
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: RORY
text: The alien. The smaller one. He was
dialog: trying to save us from the big one.
text: Almost like there’s two sides.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe they’re having a war.
text: McKenna feels a sober chill...
scene_heading: NEARBY - WILLIAMS
text: Tenses, hearing something in the woods. He SPINS, levels
text: his M16 into the darkness.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Company’s coming.
dialog: 77.
text: Which is when NETTLES BURSTS OUT OF THE BRUSH -- followed
dialog: by that goddamn PREDATOR DOG! The surviving one; the one
text: with the bolt in its forehead.
text: But the group quickly realizes: it’s not chasing him.
text: It’s merely following him.
speaker_heading: NETTLES
dialog: Anybody got a goddamn Milk Bone?
text: They watch curiously as the thing wanders like an
text: obedient (if addled) puppy.
speaker_heading: FLYBOY
dialog: Jesus, Nebraska, you
text: lobotomized the poor sumbitch.
text: The Predator Dog starts toward Rory.
text: Instantly fearful, the kid GRABS a gnarled piece of wood
text: and HURLS IT at the creature! It DUCKS -- turns to look at
text: the fallen branch. Then... PADS AWAY to retrieve it.
text: In seconds, it RETURNS to Nettles and DROPS IT at his feet.
speaker_heading: NETTLES
dialog: Well, I’1l be go-to-hell.
text: He reaches to “pet” the thing. Gently takes its
text: dreadlock-like appendages in his hand.
text: THE SNIFFER reacts oddly. Suddenly disoriented. The group
text: LAUGHS. Even Rory smiles; a moment of respite. Camaraderie.
scene_heading: INT. WINNEBAGO - SAME
text: McKENNA enters. Gets himself a beer. CASEY says:
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Nice kid.
text: McKenna nods thanks. Sits.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: You know... a lot of experts think
dialog: being on the spectrum’s not a
dialog: disorder. Some think it might even
dialog: be the next evolutionary step.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: All I know is, when his gram
text: comes over, he ignores her and
text: hugs a pillow she made.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: It’s the same love. Just
dialog: deflected. (cautiously
dialog: If I can offer an opinion... maybe
dialog: you're a little bit afraid of each
dialog: other?
text: He shakes his head, rueful.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Nice spin, but... I think
dialog: we’re both afraid of me.
text: He takes a swig of his beer.
scene_heading: EXT. OAK GROVE - OUTSIDE THE WINNEBAGO - THAT MOMENT
text: THE VETS continue to play with the beast’s DREADS. As they’re
text: touched, the Sniffer goes slack, wobbly. Like he’s stoned.
scene_heading: INT. WINNEBAGO - SAME
text: McKenna, watching this through the window.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT! D)
dialog: What do you make of those--?
dialog: (gestures to his
dialog: hair:) The Marley shit?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Maybe sensory receptors. Like...
text: cat whiskers.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: (sips his beer)
dialog: Anything else, professor?
text: She looks at him grimly --
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Just this.
text: -- and produces THE VIAL she stole from the lab.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: They extracted this from the
text: Predator’s spinal fluid. In
dialog: layman’s terms, it’s like
dialog: distilled “lizard brain.” The part
dialog: that kicks in under extreme
dialog: survival conditions.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: So..?
dialog: 719.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Remember I told you they rip
dialog: out peoples’ spines?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Sure. Trophies, you said.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Right. But if a Predator’s
dialog: first and foremost a survivor--
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wouldn’t it make sense to collect
dialog: DNA “souvenirs”?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: From... peoples’ spines?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Brain stem -- close enough. Look
dialog: suppose, just suppose, that these
text: space creatures are... siphoning
dialog: off our lizard brain juice.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: You don’t have to overdo
dialog: the “layman’s terms” --
speaker_heading: CASE
dialog: I’m just saying... it might
dialog: explain the human DNA.
dialog: 
dialog: McKenna considers this.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Collecting “survival” traits, from
dialog: the most high-end human specim --
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Why stop there? Seriously --
dialog: why not other species, too?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Extreme hybridization. That’s why
dialog: they hunt. To extract the defense
dialog: mechanisms from the strongest,
dialog: the smartest, the most dangerous
dialog: species on every planet they
dialog: visit...
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: To make hybrids.
dialog: (looks up, stunned)
dialog: Are you just pulling this out
dialog: of your ass?
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: This new Predator, the bigger one
dialog: -- it didn’t need a mask, you
dialog: notice that? And did you see its
dialog: fucking eyes?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They’ re evolving,
text: Lieutenant. Changing.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Or being upgraded.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: And here’s the clincher.
dialog: (leans in)
dialog: Project Stargazer? The shit-
dialog: show that recruited me?
dialog: Mckenna shrugs: What about it?
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: A stargazer’s a type of flower; an
dialog: orchid. And not just any orchid --
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Holy shit...
dialog: (softly)
text: A hybrid.
text: Damn. McKenna gets up. Pacing. It’s a lot to digest.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: That thing back there... the new
dialog: one, “Thing Two”? Probably top of
dialog: the line. “Thing One”? Last
dialog: year’s model.
dialog: (re: the sniffer)
dialog: Old Yeller out there’s another
dialog: kind. But none of them is the
dialog: essential Predator. You know why?
dialog: Because survival is. Because this --
text: She holds up the vial, locks eyes with McKenna.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT’D)
dialog: This is the Predator.
text: A SOUND rises outside. Distant WHORPLE of chopper blades.
text: McKenna’s up like a shot.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER
text: McKenna bursts outside -- looks to Flyboy, who’s stock
text: still, gauging the sound of the incoming copter:
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: FLYBOY
dialog: Sounds like a Pave Hawk.
text: Sikorsky. (looks at McKenna)
dialog: Not civilian.
text: All McKenna needs to hear. He whirls round --
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Lights out! MOVE--!
text: THE LOONIES SCRAMBLE to turn off lanterns as McKenna DIVES
text: into the Winnebago; renders it dark. Everyone freezes...
text: THE SIKORSKY ROARS OVERHEAD, a blinding SEARCHLIGHT raking
text: the woods. Slowly, the SOUND diminishes. Then...
text: THE COPTER TURNS. Start back in their direction. Shit!
text: McKenna looks around. As the ersatz C.0O., it’s on him to form
text: a plan. He looks at his “men.” Motley as they seem, they’ re
text: SERVICEMEN, U.S. Vets. And they’re nothing if not loyal.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: (CONT’D) Best split up.
dialog: (to Nettles)
dialog: You and Flyboy, west.
dialog: (to Baxley and
dialog: Coyle) You two north.
speaker_heading: FLYBOY
dialog: But -- what do we do?
text: And McKenna sees in their faces: they don’t want to go.
text: He grasps at straws to give them something. A mission.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: (to Flyboy)
dialog: We’1ll need air transport. Something
dialog: that can outrun that Pave Hawk.
dialog: (looks at Nettles)
dialog: And maybe some incendiaries. Never
dialog: know when we could use a diversion.
dialog: Roger that?
dialog: And that’s when: The Loonies, God bless ‘em, SALUTE
text: MCKENNA. He looks at them, abruptly moved.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Wish I had coordinates, but...
speaker_heading: FLYBOY
dialog: We’1ll find you, sir.
dialog: 82.
text: McKenna nods. SNAPS back a salute. And with that, the LOONIES
text: DISPERSE; grabbing weapons, disappearing into the woods.
speaker_heading: CUTTER
dialog: (to McKenna)
dialog: They know it’s a snipe hunt, right?
dialog: Rory’s observed this whole exchange. A tentative VOICE:
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: What’s a snipe hunt?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: When you’re chasing
dialog: something you’ll never find.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: Come on.
text: They turn to make a run for it. Get five yards before
dialog: they’re STARTLED by:
text: The PREDATOR DOG; gnarled stick clenched in its mandibles!
text: Try as it might to be adorable, it’s one ugly motherfucker.
text: As the HELICOPTER grows louder, Casey makes frantic “shoo-
text: ing” motions. But the Sniffer isn’t taking the hint.
text: She spies an errant GRENADE on the ground, SNATCHES IT UP.
text: And LOBS it as far as she can, into a ravine.
text: The Sniffer drops the wood and RACES after it.
dialog: Problem solved. Except --
speaker_heading: THE SIKORSKY
text: Is now circling the clearing. GOD-LIGHT, stabbing down --
scene_heading: TIME CUT: EXT. CLEARING - THE SIKORSKY
text: Touching down. (Loonies and Sniffer, long gone.)
text: TRAEGER steps down from the chopper, wind WHIPPING. His men
text: DRAW WEAPONS on Williams and Cutter, as...
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: (re: Winnebago)
dialog: Whose idea was the jungle camo?
text: McKenna glances at Rory, who shrugs -- told you so.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’ D)
dialog: Should have used Woodland. Might as
text: well have shot up a signal flare.
text: He approaches Casey. Regards her with a grin, then -- extends
text: his open palm. After a beat, she stiffly hands him THE VIAL.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’ D)
dialog: There, now. That wasn’t so hard.
text: His men rudely PAT DOWN McKenna and the others.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’ D)
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Where’s what?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: The device. It goes --
dialog: (mimes Predator’s
dialog: wrist gauntlet)
dialog: -- right in here.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: We threw it out of the RV.
dialog: That thing has it.
dialog: 
text: Traeger ponders.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: You know what I think? I think it’s
dialog: time for some... robust discussion.
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA’S FACE
text: CRACK--! It SLAMS into the ground! Pummeled, caked with
text: dirt. Purplish welts glisten, backlit by searchlights.
dialog: It'll take a minute, but eventually you’1ll get it: we are
text: in an abandoned abattoir. A SLAUGHTERHOUSE.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLDING PEN - NIGHT
text: McKENNA, on his knees. TWO BLACK-CLAD MERCS loom over him.
speaker_heading: MERC
dialog: You hid it once. In the mail.
dialog: Where’d you hide it this time?
dialog: 
text: A BRUTAL KICK for emphasis. McKenna COUGHS blood.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: MERC (CONT’D)
dialog: This is getting old, Lieutenant.
dialog: Cough up some more blood if you
dialog: agree.
text: Another KICK--! McKenna writhes in the mud... CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ABATTOIR OFFICE - SAME
text: CASEY, handcuffed to a chair. A few feet away, Traeger
text: pours himself a drink. Holds up the bottle:
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Can I tempt you, Ms. Brackett?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Just tell me, why are they
dialog: fucking HERE? If it’s not to
dialog: hunt, then WHY?
text: Traeger regards her coolly, shrugs, smiles:
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Ms. Brackett, do you remember a few
dialog: years back when Hostess went bust?
text: There was a run on Twinkies.
dialog: Snapped up, coast to coast. “Get
dialog: ‘em while they last”, remember?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: What are you saying, we’re
dialog: Twinkies?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Think about it. How long before
dialog: climate change makes the planet
dialog: unlivable? Two generations? One?
text: Casey’s blinks -- dawning realization:
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Jesus. We’re an endangered
dialog: species, and they know it. That’s
dialog: why they keep coming here -- they
dialog: want to snap up our best DNA
text: before it goes bye-bye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Exactly. Adapt themselves with
dialog: it, then... move in.
text: Casey blinks, stunned.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: What about their own planet?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: We think it’s dying.
dialog: (frowns)
dialog: Well -- cooling, to be precise.
dialog: 
dialog: You read the file, they thrive in
dialog: a hot-house environment. Maybe
dialog: they want to make a move to ours.
dialog: It is getting warmer, you know.
dialog: 
text: Casey shudders.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: And your angle -- the upgrade
dialog: tech, am I right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: If we can upgrade ourselves? Become
dialog: the ultimate survival engines--?
dialog: Why wouldn’t we?
text: Casey looks sick to her stomach.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: How would you disseminate it?
dialog: Who gets it?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Whoever can afford it, of course.
text: He grabs her by the hair. Yanks tightly.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’ D)
dialog: Now something is on that hijacked
dialog: ship, and I think you know what it
dialog: is...
scene_heading: INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - NIGHT
text: A rail system circles the room with meat hooks on it.
text: In one corner, a group of CRYPTOGRAPHERS study the familiar
text: PREDATOR HIEROGLYPHICS on a large DRY ERASE BOARD.
text: RORY SITS nearby, drawing with crayons. A lone GUARD keeps
text: watch on. Glances at Rory’s drawing. Says, offhandedly:
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: What’s that?
text: Rory shrugs; doesn’t look up.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Map.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Map of what?
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Where the ark is.
text: The CHATTER in the room STOPS. All eyes on Rory.
text: A CRYPTOGRAPHER approaches him, slow. Smiles
text: tentatively. Points at the drawing, says:
speaker_heading: CRY PTOGRAPHER
dialog: Um... do you mind if I..?
text: Another shrug from Rory. Whatever. The Cartographer takes
text: the “map” to the Team Leader.
speaker_heading: TEAM
speaker_heading: LEADER (sotto)
dialog: Are you insane? He’s a kid --
speaker_heading: CRY PTOGRAPHER
dialog: A kid who had that biohelmet
dialog: for twenty-four hours.
speaker_heading: TEAM LEADER
dialog: Even if the ship is there, we
dialog: still need the key to get in, the

text: He gestures at the dry erase board; DOZENS of attempts to
dialog: translate the Predator language into letters or numbers.
speaker_heading: TEAM LEADER (CONT’D)
dialog: That sequence could be a hundred
dialog: digits, for all we know--!
speaker_heading: RORY’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Twenty-two.

speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Hi, Rory. I’m Will. I
dialog: understand you know how to

text: Rory nods, tense. Bites his lip. Traeger grins.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’D) Here’s
dialog: the thing. We work for the
dialog: United States Government. Just
dialog: like your dad.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Except you’re assholes.
text: Traeger’s grin slips. Then he plasters it back on. Holds
text: up Rory’s drawing: the MAP.
speaker_heading: STEVENS
dialog: I won’t argue. Question is... will
dialog: you get me into this ship, or not?
text: Rory stiffens, wary.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: If you let my dad go.
text: Traeger glances at his lackeys. “Kid’s good.” He leans in:
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Okay. You want to play grown-up,
dialog: let’s play grown-up. Man to man..?
dialog: We’re not going to let him go. Not
dialog: until you give us what we want. But
dialog: when you do -- I promise he’1l go
text: back to the V.A. hospital... where
dialog: they will take good care of him.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: What if I don’t tell you?
text: Traeger shakes his head with disappointment; tsk tsk tsk.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Oh, now, Rory... I thought we

scene_heading: EXT. HOLDING PEN - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
text: McKenna, face in the dirt. Groggy. Barely conscious. SEES:
speaker_heading: HIS POV - RORY
text: being dragged to a waiting Sikorsky. Fueled, blades spinning.
dialog: 88.
text: MCKENNA STARTS TO MOVE, when suddenly --
scene_heading: OFF-SCREEN VOICE
dialog: Not so fast, slick.
text: THWACK--! Another KICK to his gut. THOSE FUCKING
text: MERCS, standing over him. He watches helplessly as
speaker_heading: THE CHOPPER
text: Lifts off, WHORPLES into the night sky. As it does, one of
text: the mercs draws his sidearm to END this, says to his buddy:
speaker_heading: MERC#1
dialog: Golf tomorrow?
speaker_heading: MERC #2
dialog: Why not?
text: McKenna sees what he’s doing -- COUGHS. Ropey spits of blood.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: You know what... burns me
dialog: up..? (gasp, cough)
dialog: You never even... read my file,
dialog: did you..?
text: The mercs trade amused glances.
speaker_heading: MERC #1
dialog: What makes you think that?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: ‘Cause you’re makin’ plans...
dialog: for tomorrow.
text: The mercs, VERY amused by this.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’D)
dialog: Worst part? Is you... making me
dialog: lie to my son. I really don’t like
dialog: to do that.
speaker_heading: MERC#2
dialog: What lie did you tell him?
text: McKENNA, face to camera, grins:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: That I wouldn’t enjoy this.
text: That’s when his HAND DARTS OUT, SNATCHES the guy’s forearm;
text: uses his other hand for leverage, and -- Crack--!
dialog: 89.
text: The MERC SCREAMS as McKenna SNAPS HIS FOREARM at an alarming
text: angle, then GRABS the man’s gun, presses it into his eye --
text: BLAM--! The MERC DROPS WITH A THUD as McKenna stands,
text: levels the sidearm at the remaining MERC; frozen in place.
text: Like the Predator in the lab, he was playing possum.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MEAT REFRIGERATOR
text: A walk-in. Williams and Cutter, sitting on the floor.
text: They LOOK UP TO SEE:
text: THE MERC opening the thick, industrial door; McKenna
text: holds him at gunpoint, says to the guy:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
text: Now the armory.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLDING PEN
text: A MERC rounds a corner -- BYES GO WIDE.
text: HIS POV -- the MAN McKENNA KILLED, wedged into a corner.
text: The guy turns to raise an alarm -- STOPS. His eyes widen.
text: AN INHUMAN SHAPE, LOOMING over him.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE
text: A GUN at the back of CASEY’S HEAD. She closes her eyes,
dialog: waits for the shot --
text: As, abruptly, we hear loud clumping noises from the
text: corridor outside. FOOTFALLS, as
scene_heading: AN INTRUDER, NOW
text: Pokes his head around the corner. Snuffling, drooling.
dialog: As benign as it is INHUMAN:
text: THE PREDATOR DOG. The sniffer.
text: Wagging its tail, no less. Sees Casey, the intended target
text: of its current game-in-progress... and FYI, in its mouth?
text: THE GRENADE from the clearing.
text: It’s FETCHED it. Brought it back. It DROPS the grenade --
text: CLUNK! -- right in Casey’s lap. Her ASSASSIN, stupefied...
dialog: Casey wastes no time:
dialog: 90.
text: SNATCHES UP the grenade -- pulls the pin -- SHOVES IT
text: down the guard’s SHIRT BACK.
text: Promptly BOLTS FOR THE DOOR, dragging the CHAIR
text: she’s handcuffed to --
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR
text: Hits the deck as -- FWOOM!! -- the room BLOWS OUT BEHIND HER!
text: Blood and dust and dry wall. Smoke clears, and...
text: THE PREDATOR DOG pads out of the room, unscathed. Drops a
text: new toy at her feet. Wait, sorry. Not a toy.
text: The GUARD’S SEVERED HEAD.
text: Casey throws up a little in her mouth as she hears FOOTFALLS.
text: SEES McKENNA, WILLIAMS, CUTTER (in his wheelchair)
text: come around a corner, armed to the teeth.
scene_heading: EXT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - NIGHT
text: McKenna opens the door a crack. PEERS OUT:

text: McKenna, Williams and Cutter trade looks. Shrug.
speaker_heading: CUTTER WILLIAMS
dialog: Duck soap. Piece of cake.
text: They LOCK AND LOAD, no hesitation. CASEY gapes. It’s suicide.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: See this? THIS is why the
dialog: army thinks you’re crazy!
text: Except... a SOUND now. A low pulse; BASS VIBRATO from
text: outside. MCKENNA peers through the crack again... and
text: his eyes widen. An involuntarily gasp.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: You’ve got to be kidding me.
scene_heading: EXT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - NIGHT - START ON AN ADVERTISING BANNER
text: FLAPPING in the wind. And on it, an airbrushed, scantily clad

dialog: on the side, no less, as we REVEAL:

scene_heading: INT. STOLEN CHOPPER - FLYING - NIGHT
text: FLYBOY AT THE HELM, of course. The other VETS (NETTLES,

scene_heading: EXT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

scene_heading: -- AT THE EXIT DOOR

scene_heading: AT THE STOLEN COPTER

scene_heading: INT. STOLEN COPTER - CONTINUOUS
text: This chopper was built for five people. Current load? EIGHT.

speaker_heading: FLYBOY

speaker_heading: CASEY

scene_heading: EXT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: FLYBOY (CONT’D)
dialog: You got a heading in mind,
dialog: Lieutenant?

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Follow that dog.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY IS BREAKING
dialog: On first blush, we’re back in Cuba. Same tropical foliage,
dialog: same humidity, same goddamn mosquitoes. Then we HEAR:
text: TRUDGING BOOTS. CRACKLE of radio crosstalk. And that’s
text: when we note: a long BUMPY GREEN ROCK.
dialog: Wait a minute. Did it just... move? Yes, it did. Because
dialog: it’s not a rock. It’s a fucking ALLIGATOR --
text: Because we’re in FLORIDA. The gator sinks into the swamp as
speaker_heading: TRAEGER EMERGES
text: from the brush, flanked by A SMALL ARMY OF MERCS; poor
text: Rory in tow. An AIDE clutches a hand-held GPS device.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER’S AIDE
dialog: We’re at the waypoint. Should
dialog: be right here.
text: But the clearing is just that: clear. Then, Traeger notices:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: What are those?
text: They’ re DEAD BIRDS, laying on the jungle floor in a wide arc.
scene_heading: A MERC CHEWING TOBACCO
text: Examines them. Nudges one with his boot. He SPITS to the
text: side, and -- splat! The spittle HANGS THERE IN MID-AIR.
text: Traeger sees this. Intrigued. Turns to a MERC.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Give me your weapon.
dialog: (takes the gun)
text: Paint pellets.
text: The soldier scoops some glycol pellets, hands them over.
text: Traeger loads them -- FIRES, twice. THOOK! THOOK!
dialog: 93.
text: Eerily, the TWO SPLATS OF PAINT stay frozen in the air,
text: COATING AN INVISIBLE SURFACE. Traeger points:
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’D)
speaker_heading: FIRE!
text: The entire brigade OPENS FIRE with a BLISTERING FUSILLADE!
text: RORY clamps his hands over his ears, SCREAMS silently.
text: Under the bombardment, a series of spastic SHIMMERS as,
text: BEFORE OUR EYES...
text: THE PREDATOR SPACECRAFT APPEARS--! Its cloaking device
text: short-circuited by the assault. Soldiers gape as --
text: Traeger tenses. Looks around. Where’s the Predator?
text: But nothing. Silence. A thin smile of triumph:
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: (CONT’D) We beat it here.
dialog: (to his aide)
dialog: Get on the horn. Tell Woodhurst
dialog: we have his space ship.
text: He turns to Rory -- ushers the boy forward, gripping
text: his shoulder. SHOVES HIM toward --
scene_heading: THE SHIP’S ENTRYWAY
text: And next to the hatch... an ALIEN CODE BOX.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’ D)
dialog: Open it.
text: Rory hesitates. Feeling all eyes on him, he relents. Reaches
text: for the code box. TWO DOZEN DUMBSTRUCK SOLDIERS look on --
text: As a little boy inputs the code from memory.
text: SH-KKK! As easy as that, the HATCH OPENS. Traeger turns
dialog: to his AIDE. Points. You’re coming, too.
scene_heading: INT. THE ARK
text: A cavernous THRUM oscillates as Traeger looks around,
text: petrified. The technology is clearly alien. Then he notices:
scene_heading: THE STASIS CYLINDERS
text: INSET around the periphery of the hold.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER’S AIDE
dialog: What the hell are they?
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: TRAEGER

dialog: (to his aide)
dialog: Tell the men to secure the craft;
dialog: get it ready for transport. I want
dialog: it moving before that... THING gets
dialog: here.
text: RORY, meanwhile, has noticed a control panel:
speaker_heading: A MONITOR
text: On it, THE GRAPHIC depicted in our opening. The stasis

text: Except the COUNTDOWN has stopped, MID-SEQUENCE...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. STOLEN COPTER - FLYING - LATE AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Go, baby, go. Run to papa.
text: Casey frowns. Points below, WHERE:
speaker_heading: THE SNIFFER

text: McKENNA raises his binocs:
scene_heading: HIS POV - ABANDONED DIRT ROAD
text: Not just “activity” -- it’s THE ARK. Currently in transit --

speaker_heading: FLYBOY

scene_heading: DARKNESS (COULD BE ANYWHERE)
text: A space. Cramped, disorienting -- where are we?
text: Then, a familiar, TALON-LIKE HAND raises an equally familiar

scene_heading: EXT. THE ARK - ENTRANCE HATCH
text: TRAEGER’S AIDE appears at the hatch. Physically GRABS

speaker_heading: TRAEGER’S AIDE
dialog: We’re taking ‘er up! Where’s
dialog: the kid?

text: A volley of energy BLOWS THE TWO MEN OUT THE OPEN HATCH!
dialog:

scene_heading: THE UPGRADED PREDATOR, NOW
text: EMERGES, fetus-like from a FLOOR COMPARTMENT. He’s

dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. “ARK” - CONTINUOUS

text: But at least he’s OUTSIDE. And that’s when
text: THE GROUND RISES UP
text: In his path. Literally comes alive, like a CREATURE --
scene_heading: AS McKENNA STANDS
text: Trailing dirt. The SOD from the trailer park GARDEN strapped

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Easy, buddy. It’s me. Dad.

scene_heading: AN OTHERWORLDLY HUMMING, NOW

scene_heading: ON THE SHIP -- MOVEMENT, NOW

speaker_heading: THE HYBRIDS
dialog: 104.
text: Converge on him. GATHERING. Circling their leader in ragged

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Are you... are you okay?
text: Mckenna frowns. No answer. Rory’s not looking at him.
text: He’s looking UP. Petrified... because they’re not alone.
dialog: Something’s in here with them.
text: McKenna follows his gaze. A low animal CHITTERING, all
text: too familiar... above them, hanging UPSIDE DOWN: not a
dialog: holographic projection, but the real deal --
scene_heading: A SPIDER/PREDATOR HYBRID.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ARK - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. RAILHEAD - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: It was in there the whole time, you

speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: Fool me twice, shame on me.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Where was it going? WHERE DID HE
dialog: WANT YOU TO TAKE HIM--?
speaker_heading: TRAEGER
dialog: That’s classified, Lieutenant.
text: Before McKenna can respond with action, Traeger DRAWS
text: HIS SIDEARM ON HIM; a twinkle in his eye.
speaker_heading: TRAEGER (CONT’ D)
dialog: Kind of ironic, really. A trained
text: sniper, dying from a headshot.
text: BLAMM--! McKenna flinches as -- BLOOD spatters his face.
text: A thousand-meter-a-second SNIPER ROUND just pierced
text: TRAEGER’S HEAD. The guy drops, lifeless. SHIT. McKENNA

text: Nope. M24 sniper rifle.
text: GENERAL WOODHURST, comes into view, flanked by ARMY troops.
speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: Good riddance to bad rubbish.
dialog: (NOTE: This is the General we saw on the phone with Traeger
text: earlier.) He stops just shy of McKenna. Nods tersely:
speaker_heading: WOODHURST (CONT’D)
dialog: Breathe easy, soldier. I’m on
dialog: your side.
text: CASEY, RORY and THE LOONIES step forward to join McKenna.
text: Woodhurst regards them. Points to Rory, Casey, and Cutter:
speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: (CONT’D) You stay here.
dialog: (looks up)
dialog: The rest of you, come with me.

text: Off McKenna, stupefied:
speaker_heading: WOODHURST (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, yeah. Son of a whore went off

speaker_heading: WOODHURST (CONT’D)
dialog: There’s a cold war going on,

dialog: (re: Predators)
dialog: These two... are defectors.
dialog: Been here almost a year.
text: McKenna, at a loss. No words. Finally manages:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: They’re okay with... with

speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: Oh, we let ‘em out at night. Game
dialog: preserve, next door. They’re peace

speaker_heading: WILLIAMS

speaker_heading: MCKENNA

speaker_heading: WOODHURST

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: So, he’s... an assassin?
speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: That’s right, Lieutenant. That

dialog: (icy glance)
dialog: Just like you.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Say you’re right. It takes out

text: Without warning, ONE OF THE PREDATORS “talks”; its peculiar,

text: An AIDE hands Woodhurst a device with a small LED screen.
text: He keys it like a walkie-talkie, says:
speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: Please repeat that.
text: The Predator repeats with more emphasis. Woodhurst looks at
scene_heading: THE LED SCREEN
text: A brief delay, we see: Searching... Searching... finally,

speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR VOICE
dialog: “Protocol 3. The synthetic will

speaker_heading: WOODHURST

speaker_heading: WOODHURST
dialog: Get ‘em outta here.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Who?
text: Woodhurst points at the Predators in the enclosure.
speaker_heading: WOODHURST

scene_heading: THE TWO PREDATORS

speaker_heading: WILLIAMS (CONT’D)
dialog: Guess they took care of the bugs?

speaker_heading: MCKENNA, UP TOP

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Incoming!
speaker_heading: THE HYBRIDS

scene_heading: TWO MORE HYBRIDS

speaker_heading: -- MCKENNA
dialog: 113.

speaker_heading: BAXLEY
speaker_heading: (CONT’D) (pointing)
dialog: THEIR NECKS!
text: McKenna squints at:
text: THE HYBRIDS, IN PURSUIT
text: And there, sure enough, something resembling COLLARS.
text: McKenna raises the TRANSLATOR PAD; YELLS to the

speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: WHAT ARE THOSE COLLARS?!
text: The Predator BARKS and TRILLS between blasts.
text: CLOSE ON TRANSLATOR: Searching... Searching...
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR VOICE
dialog: “Self. Destruct.”

text: Rory overhears this; GRABS Casey’s talkie, excited:
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Dad, it’s me, I saw it! I saw the
dialog: the program! The first Predator
dialog: was trying to blow them up, but
dialog: the sequence stopped.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Can you do it?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: There was something about self-
text: destruct in the file. The one
dialog: Schaefer met in ‘87 left a
dialog: pretty big hole.
speaker_heading: RORY
text: These only have a ten-foot radius.
dialog: We’re cool. Sort of.
text: Casey turns, incredulous. Rory squirms, self-conscious:
speaker_heading: RORY
speaker_heading: (CONT’D) Maybe twenty.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I, uh, saw it in the helmet.
text: Suddenly paranoid, Casey YANKS THE SNIFFER’S COLLAR OFF -

text: IT, playing fetch again.

scene_heading: THE PREDATOR, THE BIG BAD

text: He sports TWO WRIST GAUNTLETS -- projectile arrows
dialog: and CANNON. That’s it. Lean and mean.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MCKENNA

scene_heading: INT. ARK - THAT MOMENT

scene_heading: -- EXT. THE ARK
dialog: Landing this fucker ain’t easy. Plus it’s damaged,

dialog: Are you trying to crash?? I

speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: I’M IN SPECIAL CLASS, OKAY?
text: A sudden LURCH. The DESTRUCT console JERKS in her hands,
text: and she blinks, registering: it moves.
dialog: New idea.
text: She GRABS THE CONTROL PANEL, hauls it loose -- and PROPELS
text: it across the deck toward:
scene_heading: AN ESCAPE POD.
dialog: We saw the first Predator use one: at the start of the film.
text: THE HATCH SLIDES DOWN, eclipses her from view
speaker_heading: -- RORY
dialog: On it. Knows what to do, GRABS the control yoke, and
scene_heading: -- EXT. THE ARK
text: IT SWIVELS IN PLACE like a cannon, lining up, AIMING
scene_heading: -- INT. ESCAPE POD
text: CASEY sees a red button, SLAMS it, and WHOOOOSH--!

scene_heading: EXT. FLORIDA TOWN - MAIN DRAG - THAT MOMENT
text: It tumbles... SLAMS DOWN! Traverses the length of the street.
scene_heading: INSIDE: CASEY’S JOLTED, SCREAMING, AS --
text: OUTSIDE: THE HYBRIDS watch the pod SCREAM PAST them,
text: hesitate with confusion. That’s when WE SEE:
dialog: 118.
text: Tiny red LEDs on their collars are BLINKING...
text: And now? One by one, before our eyes, THE HYBRIDS EXPLODE
text: AS THE SPACECRAFT SKIDS PAST THEM -- like a string of
scene_heading: NUCLEAR FIRECRACKERS -- THOOM! THOOM! THOOM!
scene_heading: EXT. ATOP THE PERSONNEL CARRIER - MOVING
text: McKenna sees the sky behind them LIGHT UP from the detonating
text: hybrids. But his exhilaration is cut short as he notices:

dialog: Oh, shit.
text: The TWO PREDATORS RAISE their wrist gauntlets -- THOOK!
text: THOOK! LAUNCHING GRAPPLING HOOKS! Yank the corpse UP --
dialog: AND HEAVE IT OFF THE APC
text: Like fishermen throwing a marlin back into the
text: ocean. Williams puts the pedal to the metal:
text: BA-WHOOM!! THE HYBRID EXPLODES, mid-air.
dialog: At which point, not to be outdone -- Williams
text: promptly CRASHES.
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: The APC PLOWS through chainlink, THROWING McKenna and the
text: Predators off... and meanwhile, back at the ranch --
scene_heading: EXT. ESCAPE POD
text: The hatch POPS OPEN... Casey half-crawls, half-TUMBLES
text: out. Looks up, sweaty, feral --
text: ONE HYBRID LEFT. A weird, SATANIC looking thing,
text: rushing straight at her --
text: It comes in range of the signal. BLOWS.
text: She dives for COVER behind the pod. Bits of PREDATOR-
text: THING, raining. A dismembered TORSO arcs down. Hits the
text: tarmac. Turns to her, STILL ALIVE, REACHING --
text: She rips out its spine.
dialog: 119.
text: The SNIFFER lopes up beside her. A proud hunting dog...
text: admiring its Huntress. An image to remember.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL STADIUM - NIGHT
text: McKENNA and WILLIAMS, sprawled. Groggy. Ten yard-line of

dialog: THE ARK IS DOWN
text: Just past the fifty yard-line. Imbedded in the turf.
scene_heading: AND THERE’S RORY
text: Limping from the ship. Disoriented.
text: McKenna starts toward him. His expression suggests that once
text: he has the boy in his arms, he’s not likely to let go.
text: At which point, the “DEFECTOR” PREDATORS RISE
text: SLOWLY, throatily CLICKING... Grab their WEAPONS.
text: Then? Everything goes to hell. Striding across the field --
text: THE UPGRADE. Big as life.
text: Raises the GAUNTLET. Promptly spikes an ION BLAST through
text: each of the smaller Predators; DISINTEGRATING them --
text: He BELLOWS victory: Mission Accomplished. Then PIVOTS.
text: Mandibles twitching -- walks toward ITS CLOSEST
text: REMAINING FOE, human or alien:
dialog: The kid. The loser. “Ass Burger.”
text: The Predator SCOOPS HIM UP in one hand -- regards him
text: clinically, with something akin to... RESPECT? Turns, now...
text: And enters the downed spaceship. With Rory.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: RORY!!!
text: The HATCH SLAMS SHUT.
text: McKenna stares in disbelief... then starts after them,
dialog: the FULL meaning of this hitting him --
dialog: His son figured out how to fly the Ark; how to kill the
dialog: hybrids. So what does that mean to the Upgrade? Only this:
text: RORY IS ITS MOST EVOLVED OPPONENT.
dialog: 120.
scene_heading: INT. THE ARK - A CRYOTUBE

scene_heading: EXT. BLEACHERS - ON MCKENNA
text: As the spacecraft’s engines RUMBLE, and -- HE VAULTS up
dialog: the bleacher steps--!
text: Williams sees this. Trades a glance with Flyboy. They

speaker_heading: THE ARK RISES
text: Plasma exhaust SPEWING, as McKenna SCRAMBLES up bleachers --
text: THE ARK, now fifteen feet below the top of the stadium...
text: MCKENNA doesn’t slow. Runs, LAUNCHES into the air --
text: Touches down, WHACK--! ON TOP OF THE SHIP. He yelps in
text: pain. ANKLE, twisted, and meanwhile --
scene_heading: WILLIAMS AND FLYBOY, MORE SENSIBLE
text: Stand, looking down at him. Patiently wait as the top of
text: the ship RISES EVEN WITH THEM --
text: STEP ON, like stepping onto an escalator.
text: McKenna shoots them a withering look.
text: That’s when the ship TURNS, throwing the three men
text: off balance. THEY SCRAMBLE to find handholds --
scene_heading: EXT. FLORIDA TOWN - THAT MOMENT
text: LOCAL POLICE CARS, screaming into view, flashers turning.
text: A MOTORCYCLE COP looks up, stunned. SEEING:
scene_heading: HIS POV - THE ARK RISING
text: Over the treeline.
text: He GRABS for his lapel mike -- but that’s the same moment his

text: CASEY, aiming his own sidearm at him.
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
dialog: You don’t want to do this, lady.
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: There’s a lot of shit I don’t
dialog: wanna do, Ponch.
text: She mounts his Harley, ROARS OFF after the Predator ship.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ARK - AERIAL
text: Just in time for OUR VERTIGO SHOT -- as the ship ascends
text: with our three soldiers hanging precariously.
text: McKenna’s backpack SLIDES away -- He flails at it, the
text: Predator weapons disgorging, tumbling earthward, fuck --
text: He hauls it in, secures it. Cups his ear, the one with the
text: BLUETOOTH inside. YELLS into the com over the RUSHING WIND:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Rory, I’m on top of the ship!!
dialog: Are you okay?!
scene_heading: INT. ARK
text: Safe in his coffin-like tube, Rory is shocked to hear his
text: Dad. Puts his hand over his mouth so the Predator won’t hear:
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Mom was right. You are crazy.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD BELOW - NIGHT
text: CASEY’s stolen chopper ROARS in pursuit of the spaceship. She
text: sees something by the side of the road, BRAKES abruptly-- !
text: The items that fell from the ship. Dented, scarred:
text: A Predator BIOHELMET. A few feet beyond it, A CLOAKING
dialog: BALL. Like the one McKenna used in Cuba.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ARK - FLYING
text: Mid-air, Williams looks up, blanches. POINTS:
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Uh-oh. On your six, chief!
text: McKenna squints, seeing something on the horizon.
text: Scratch that: TWO THINGS, on the horizon:
scene_heading: F-22 RAPTOR STEALTH FIGHTERS
text: Closing fast. The ones Woodhurst scrambled.
text: A SIDEWINDER LAUNCHES from one of them, AND --
dialog: 122.
scene_heading: INT. ARK
text: RORY, tense, peers from hiding at
speaker_heading: A MONITOR
text: depicting the incoming air-to-air missile. Then a blinking
text: DOTTED LINE begins to form, surrounding the ship. Rory taps
text: his Bluetooth, FRANTIC:
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Dad?? There’s a force field
dialog: going online -- automatic!
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (O.S.)
dialog: Um -- say again?
speaker_heading: RORY
text: Just... JUMP! STRAIGHT UP, NOW!
scene_heading: EXT. THE ARK - SERIES OF SHOTS
text: No time to argue, McKenna YELLS THE ORDER to his men:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: JUMP--!
text: What happens next, happens quickly. The force field
text: DOES engage, but first, THREE THINGS:
text: 1) McKENNA attempts to jump. STUMBLES. Falls FLAT.
text: 2) WILLIAMS? He does jump. Straight UP, in fact.
text: 3) FLYBOY, alas, does neither. He FREEZES, caught out, as --
dialog: 
text: THE INVISIBLE FORCE FIELDS BLASTS ON with an ionized CRACKLE!
dialog: Now, let’s tally the result. First off --
text: MCKENNA is lying UNDER the field, which is just above him.
text: A LOCK OF HIS HAIR feathers down, clipped.
speaker_heading: NEBRASKA
text: COMES DOWN, boots first, ON TOP of the force shield!
text: Standing in mid-aid. Surreal. But sadly:
scene_heading: CONFUSED FLYBOY
text: has been cut off at the knees. SEVERED, he topples away.
dialog: His last flight.
scene_heading: NEBRASKA, NOW, DROPS DOWN
dialog: 123.
text: Hanging on for dear life. Lies splayed, palms flat, separated
text: from McKenna only by the force shield. Without it, they’d be
dialog: on TOP of each other.
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS - THE INCOMING MISSILE
text: BLASTS OVERHEAD: a MISS. Passes them and RIPS FORWARD into --
scene_heading: THE TREES AHEAD
text: Vanishes. Pause... DETONATION.
text: Tower of FLAME. They’re going to pass right through it.
text: McKenna, breathless, under the shields. Protected.
dialog: Nebraska, not so much.
text: They face each other through the barrier. Lock eyes;
text: inches apart a moment before:
text: NEBRASKA IS BURNED AWAY, flames engulfing the spacecraft.
scene_heading: INT. F-22 - FLYING - THAT MOMENT
text: The SECOND PILOT adjusts his HUD. LOCKS ON the Predator Ark.
speaker_heading: F-22 PILOT
text: Two five-six, bogey’s in my sights,
text: fangs out. Lighting up ‘winders...
text: AN ALARM PIERCES: something’s wrong. The PILOT looks to
dialog: his radar, shit, he’s being painted, as --
scene_heading: THE PREDATOR SHIP, RETALIATING
text: Hell, yeah. From the craft, an energy bolt LANCES UPWARD.
text: Mere feet in front of McKenna, nearly INCINERATES him --
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. F-22 - SAME
text: THE PILOT engages the ejection handle, and -- FWOOSH!
text: Pilot and seat both ROCKET AWAY AS --
text: The ship DISSOLVES into flame beneath him.
scene_heading: EXT. PREDATOR ARK - WITH MCKENNA
text: SEEING the jet go to PIECES, high overhead. He looks
text: around, desperation mounting. Has a nutty idea.
text: He draws a gun, grips it tightly. Galvanizes, and --
scene_heading: LAUNCHES HIMSELF
dialog: 124,
text: ROLLS toward the edge, not stopping -- tumbles off the ship,
text: OVER THE FUCKING EDGE! We think it’s suicide. But nope:
text: As long as he’s inside the shield, he can RIDE the fucker.
text: Which he DOES. Slewing. Tumbling down an invisible slide.
text: CLUD--! Fetches to a stop. UNDERNEATH the craft.
text: Florida blows by beneath him. The only thing that’s got his
text: back, utterly INVISIBLE. He decides not to look down.
text: Fixates OVERHEAD, instead, on:
text: THE EXPOSED SHIP’S BELLY. More specifically--?
text: The EMPTY PORT where an escape pod once nestled. He wrestles
text: his way inside, clinging to a strut. Sees a keypad, YELLS:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: RORY! What’s the sequence?? I
dialog: watched you put it in, TELL ME!
scene_heading: INT. ARK - CRYOTUBE - INTERCUT:
dialog: Rory HEARS this, stammers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: To the pod?? I... I can’t remember.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Okay, do this -- TRY.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: I can’t think, it’s mixed up in
dialog: my head --
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Dammit, son, I watched you! It
dialog: was one, two, then over three, up
dialog: two...
text: McKenna stops. Blinks.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Holy shit. I fucking KNOW it.
text: He begins frantically stabbing away at the entry pad.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’ D)
dialog: Rory? You know how I always said
dialog: be a big boy?
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Screw it. Make yourself small,
dialog: kid. (beat)
dialog: DOWN! NOW!
text: The hatch slides back --
text: McKenna UNLOADS, shot after shot. Targeting any
text: BLINKING LIGHTS. BLAZES AWAY. Teeth bared, fearsome --
scene_heading: INT. THE ARK
text: The ship SHUDDERS violently as --
text: THE PREDATOR whips around in his seat, ALARM KLAXONS
text: PEALING. Registers the OPEN DOOR; a visitor. Doesn’t miss a
text: beat. Raises an arm, FIRES --
scene_heading: McKENNA, BLOWN BACKWARD
text: THE BLAST knocks him loose. Sends him TUMBLING backward
dialog: into open air --
dialog: And we say “open air” because even as the energy shield
text: catches him, high over Florida, we can see it’s
text: FLICKERING. Like a bulb before it goes out --
text: And then, it goes out.
text: McKENNA DROPS. Like a stone, even as
scene_heading: THE PREDATOR ARK, CRIPPLED
text: Begins descending. Pitching, yawing --
scene_heading: ALSO DESCENDING - MCKENNA
text: But faster. PLUMMETING, a thousand feet in the air. SEES:
scene_heading: A LONE PARACHUTE
text: Billowing. THE EJECTED PILOT from the first F-22.
text: MCKENNA ADJUSTS COURSE in mid-air; SLAMS into the guy, and
text: -- GRABS HOLD, breaking his fall, as
scene_heading: EXT. FLORIDA SWAMP - DAWN - THE PREDATOR ARK
text: PIERCES the trees, SKIMS ACROSS brackish water --
text: HURTLES INTO a fallen willow, CRACK--!
scene_heading: INT. ARK (INTERCUT:)
text: The VIEW PORT explodes outward. Predator, EJECTED..!
dialog: 126.
text: Exits, pinwheels through space...
text: Disappears into the BOG. Vanishes, submerged. The ship
text: subsides, comes to rest in...
speaker_heading: THE SWAMP
dialog: Primitive. Primordial. What the world was like before the
dialog: dinosaurs. Silence...
speaker_heading: MCKENNA, NOW
text: CRASHES DOWN--! Through the branches. Breaking ribs,
text: tearing skin. Tossed like a rag doll, until --
scene_heading: EXT. SWAMP - DAWN
text: He JERKS TO A HALT, hanging in a tree branch twenty feet
dialog: off the ground. Much like when we met first him.
text: Unconscious PILOT, strapped beside him.
text: McKenna takes stock. Looks down, at
scene_heading: THE MASSIVE FIGURE
text: RISING from the swamp. Back hunched; shards peppering its
text: flesh. Rivulets of phosphorescent green blood...
scene_heading: THE UPGRADED PREDATOR
text: It’s down to the two of them.
text: McKenna doesn’t waste a second. He’s already unlimbered his
text: sniper rifle and he DOUBLE-TAPS the trigger, puts TWO IN
text: ITS CHEST. And from there..? It never stops.
speaker_heading: THE CREATURE
text: BELLOWS..! Stumbles back, collides with the downed ARK. Puts
text: a hand out to STEADY itself, grips the craft --
dialog: Mistake.
scene_heading: INT. ARK - WITH RORY
text: RORY LEAPS to the console. Finds a flickering button, POUNDS
text: it with his tiny fist --
text: And just like that, triggers the FORCE SHIELDS.
scene_heading: EXT. ARK
text: The Predator looks down, goggles --
dialog: 127.
text: Noting the neatly cauterized STUMP where its forearm was.
text: The limb DROPS AWAY as the Predator looks on, dumbly.
scene_heading: McKENNA, MEANWHILE
text: Drops..! ROLLS -- comes up running. BLASTING shots at the
text: creature. Dives behind a tree... And blinks. Because right
text: in front of him, incongruously:
text: A MOTORCYCLE. Just lying there.
text: He snaps his gaze upward, hearing trees move --
text: seeing NOTHING -- as, without warning
text: CASEY, CLOAKING BALL IN HAND
text: Shimmers and MATERIALIZES BEFORE OUR EYES. Launches,
text: snarling, from an OVERHEAD TREE BRANCH. Onto the
dialog: Predator’s shoulders..!
text: She grabs a fistful of DREADLOCKS. SLICES THEM CLEAN OFF--!
text: THE PREDATOR STAGGERS and WEAVES. Disoriented.
text: CLAWING blindly at the air.
text: MCKENNA tosses his rifle -- pulls the COMBISTICK --
dialog: Here we go. The final flurry:
speaker_heading: THE UPGRADE
text: SWATS McKENNA aside. CASEY, sent tumbling. Then the
text: Predator SPINS, startled -- struck by THREE BULLETS, as
text: HOLY FUCK, THE GUY IN THE TREE!
text: The PILOT, has removed his Sig-Sauer from his nylon vest
text: and, still strapped in, starts RAINING COVER FIRE --
scene_heading: PREDATOR, ONE SWIFT MOVE
text: Triggers an ION BLAST. Blows the tree to
text: splinters. Obliterates him.
text: DEBRIS showers down. McKenna, scrambling...
speaker_heading: THE PREDATOR
text: UNLOADS. Looses a veritable FIRESTORM. Triggers BLAST
text: AFTER BLAST, churning up water, SHREDDING trees --
text: Our heroes can do nothing but duck and cover.
dialog: 128.
text: They’re no match. CASEY is blown six feet through the air,
text: HITS, rattled, and it’s all over -- heroes, done. EXCEPT:
text: Now, above the din, a SOUND intrudes upon Casey’s
text: consciousness. Subtle at first, she squints --
text: Now WE hear it -- a heavy PANTING off-camera, as
speaker_heading: THE SNIFFER
text: PADS INTO VIEW. Something in its mouth. IT DROPS IT
text: at Casey’s feet; an offering.
speaker_heading: CASEY’S POV:
text: THE SELF-DESTRUCT COLLAR. The one she threw away earlier.
dialog: It fetched it back.
text: At which point, everything proceeds like a BLUR:
text: Casey, no hesitation. She scoops it up, feverishly
text: accessing buttons on her WRIST GAUNTLET --
text: Across the clearing, McKENNA sees this, yells:
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT’D)
text: TOSS IT.
text: She doesn’t ask questions. Slings it. Across the clearing
text: to McKENNA -- who SNAGS it from air, just in time to DIVE.
text: Narrowly misses being INCINERATED --
text: He hits, ROLLS -- comes up in a combat crouch;
text: HAVING RETRIEVED THE PREDATOR’S SEVERED ARM.
dialog: The one with the arrows.
text: He loops the COLLAR over the double-pronged
scene_heading: PROJECTILES. Pivots, AIMS as --
text: CASEY, ON THE RUN
text: Triggers the last two digits in the arming code:
text: The LED BLINKS RED.
text: McKenna FIRES; takes the creature in the leg. IMBEDS.
dialog: Pause...
speaker_heading: THE EXPLOSION
text: HURLS THE PREDATOR backward--! Red smoke and flames subside,
dialog: revealing...
dialog: 129.
text: A FIFTEEN FOOT CRATER.
text: Smoking. Seething... in the midst of it, the PREDATOR,
text: a bloodied green mess. Writhing... barely alive.
text: McKENNA and CASEY stagger forward, Casey in battle mode
speaker_heading: RORY, NOW
text: Staggers out of the downed ARK... rushes to his
text: father’s side. They embrace, but McKenna’s eyes never
text: leave the Predator; rifle at the ready.
text: Cautiously, he reaches in his pack. Brings out the TRANSLATOR
dialog: DEVICE. Keys it...
speaker_heading: MCKENNA (CONT! D)
dialog: (to The Predator)
dialog: Who are you..? What are you?
text: The Predator, half-conscious, “answers” with its trademark
text: rattle of TRILLS AND CLICKS. Searching... Searching...
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR
dialog: VOICE “I... warrior.”
dialog: (beat)
dialog: “You?”
text: McKenna trades looks at Rory. A shrug. Not resigned, but...
dialog: maybe a hint of pride?
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Same.
text: The creature points at RORY.
speaker_heading: TRANSLATOR VOICE
dialog: “Warrior... NEW breed.”
dialog: That’s bizarre. For a moment we’d swear it’s favoring the
text: kid with a FOND LOOK, one of admiration --
dialog: Then it GOES for the kid.
text: The last of its strength, LASHES OUT, talons bared --
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
text: Puts two SHOTS THROUGH ITS EYE.
text: The Predator slumps. Dead. McKenna’s eyes shift to his
text: son, spattered in green blood. Staring.
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: That’s okay. You can shoot
dialog: him again if you want.
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: I’m good.
text: A COMMOTION, NOW, they turn their gaze skyward, as
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS:
text: HUEYS come ratcheting in, CIRCLING the clearing.
text: SOLDIERS, rappelling down through TREE TOPS --
scene_heading: A PLATOON OF U.S. MILITARY
text: Touches down, immediately sprinting for the three
text: SURVIVORS, forming a makeshift perimeter --
scene_heading: WE HEAR A FAMILIAR SNORT
text: And the slobbering PREDATOR DOG pads into view. Bee-lines
text: to Casey, panting for her favor.
text: EVERY MILITARY WEAPON SWIVELS to draw a bead on it.
text: But like an Amazon warrior, Casey divests the nearest
text: soldier of his weapon. Spins, COCKS IT -- !
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: You touch my dog and I’11 kill you.
text: One of the soldiers RUNS up to them.
scene_heading: SOLDIER AT EXTRACTION SITE
dialog: Lieutenant McKenna?
text: The soldier hands him a cell phone.
text: McKenna puts the phone to his ear, perplexed. Then...
text: a relieved smile, and he hands the phone to his son.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Mom?
scene_heading: EXT. RORY’S HOUSE - DAY (INTERCUT:)
text: EMILY, on the front porch. Clutching a phone:
dialog: 131.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Are you okay, honey?
text: His answer, drowned out by the ROAR OF A CHOPPER descending.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: What’d you say, peanut?
text: Rory plugs his ears. SHOUTS:
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Ich liebe auch tou!
text: But still, no good. The helicopter, deafening.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: WHAT? ?
text: Now the chopper DIES DOWN... just in time for us to hear:
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: I love you.
scene_heading: TIME CUT: MINUTES LATER - ON CASEY AND McKENNA
text: Approaching the helicopter.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: It’s weird. The file was all about
dialog: how honorable these things are...
dialog: (re: upgrade)
dialog: But this one -- he wasn’t about
dialog: hunting. No sporting chance,
dialog: nothing. Just slaughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MCKENNA
dialog: You said it yourself, it had
dialog: human DNA...
dialog: (smiles sadly)
dialog: They’ re becoming more like us.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: (unsettled)
dialog: McKenna, did we... did we
dialog: just start a war?
text: Now, a VOICE from the chopper:
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Negatory. The war’s
dialog: already started.
text: They both look up as, framed in the hatchway, REVEAL:
scene_heading: “DUTCH” SCHAEFER
text: The Predator’s first adversary. Face haunted;
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: Dutch Schaefer, U.S. Special
dialog: Forces. Come with me.
speaker_heading: RORY
dialog: Uh... me, too?
text: Schaefer nods, smiles grimly... says:
speaker_heading: SCHAEFER
dialog: Especially you.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: CREDITS.
dialog: 132.
text: etched by pain.
dialog:
