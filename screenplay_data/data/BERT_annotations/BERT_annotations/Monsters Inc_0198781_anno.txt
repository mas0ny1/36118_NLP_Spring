dialog: Sleep tight, Kiddo!
text: The bedroom light CLICKS off. Soft moonlight illuminates the
text: room. A little boy snuggles into bed as his parents’
text: footsteps fade away down the hall. All is quiet.
text: The closet door CREAKS open. The boy looks around the room
text: nervously, eyes growing wide. Suddenly, he spies a TENTACLE,
text: emerging from the closet. The boy turns away in fear, but a
text: second look reveals it to be just a SHIRT SLEEVE. He relaxes
text: back into bed.
text: A DARK SHADOW cuts across the bedspread. From under the bed,
text: a pair of EVIL RED EYES peer out.
text: Rising up behind the boy, preparing to scare his young
text: victim, towers a FEARSOME MONSTER.
text: The boy sees the monster and SCREAMS.
text: The monster, horrified by the child, lets out an even more
text: blood curdling SCREAM of his own.
text: He backs away and slips on a soccer ball, which ricochets off
text: the wall and beans him squarely on the face. He stumbles
text: back onto a skateboard, slips, and lands on a pile of JACKS.
text: Crazed with pain, the monster runs around the room, SQUEALING
text: and holding his backside.
