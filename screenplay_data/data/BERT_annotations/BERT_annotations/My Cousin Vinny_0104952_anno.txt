dialog: those marks without Positraction,
dialog: which was not available on a ‘64
dialog: Skylark.
speaker_heading: VINNY

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: It’s a limited slip differential

dialog: {Trotter and Wilbur
dialog: quietly exchange
dialog: words.)
dialog: The Skylark had a regular
dialog: differential which...anyone’s

speaker_heading: VINNY
dialog: Is that it?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: No, there’s more.
dialog: (points to picture)
text: When the right wheel went up on
dialog: the curb, the left tire mark

dialog: axle, so when the right wheel goes

speaker_heading: LISA (Cont‘d)

dialog: (in sum)
dialog: Now, in the sixties, there were
dialog: only two other cars made in
dialog: America with an independent rear
dialog: suspension, Positraction and
dialog: enough power to make these marks.
dialog: One was the Corvette, which cannot
