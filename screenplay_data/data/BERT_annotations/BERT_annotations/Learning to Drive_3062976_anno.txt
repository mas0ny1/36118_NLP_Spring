text: Time: Present day, month of May. Place: New York City.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVING TEST SITE —- LATE AFTERNOON
text: 
text: A small economy CAR proceeds down the street. Driving around
dialog: a kiddy park and public swimming pool with kids in the
text: background. The PLACARD mounted on top says "WINDSOR DRIVING
text: SCHOOL." We hear a man's voice, with a soft East Indian
text: accent.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Make a left.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVING TEST SITE —- STUDENT CAR —- LATE AFTERNOON
text: 
text: ANGLE ON SIGNAL LEVER - A BOY'S HAND pushes it down.
text: STEERING WHEEL - BOYS' HANDS turn it counterclockwise.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Slow down. Execute a three-point
text: turn.
text: THE CAR stops, makes a careful U-Turn.
text: POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD - approaching a line of parked cars. A
text: man's FINGER enters frame, pointing to an empty space.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: Park there.
text: THE CAR slides expertly into the space.
text: PASSENGER POV - DOOR OPENS, we see the distance to the curb:
dialog: six inches. Perfect.
text: NEW ANGLE - Now we see the car's occupants. At the wheel, a
text: 16-year-old BOY who looks 12. Beside him: a Sikh man, still
text: handsome in his mid-50's, full beard and sky-blue turban. He
text: holds himself erect and formal, wears a freshly ironed shirt
dialog: and tie. He would seem severe if not for his great warm,
text: brown eyes. This is DARWAN SINGH.
speaker_heading: DARWAN
dialog: Mr. Yampolsky, you have followed
dialog: all the rules. You will pass your
dialog: test tomorrow, I am sure of it.
text: The boy DRUMS on the wheel, mimes dancing in his seat.
dialog: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8/21/13 2.
text: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DARWAN (cont'd)
dialog: (gentle but firm)
dialog: And after you get your license, I
dialog: suspect you will buy the biggest,
dialog: fastest car...and throw all the
text: rules out the window.
dialog: (boy grins)
dialog: It's not a joke. Remember, driving
dialog: is a freedom. I wish you to enjoy
dialog: every kind of freedom, as long you
dialog: don't hurt someone. So follow the
dialog: rules. Will you promise me?
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Okay, Mr. Singh.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDSOR DRIVING SCHOOL - LATER —- MAGIC HOUR
text: Darwan parks the student car alongside others like it, behind
text: the Windsor School storefront. He gets out, drops the keys in
text: a locked box.
scene_heading: INT. WINDSOR DRIVING SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER — MAGIC HOUR
text: ANGLE ON TV SCREEN
text: We're watching a driving instruction film made in the 60's. A
text: man (HAROLD SMITH) drives a wide convertible down a boulevard
text: in L.A. He reviews the five principles of safe driving as
text: they flash across the screen:
speaker_heading: HAROLD SMITH
dialog: One: Aim High In Steering. Two: Get
dialog: the Big Picture. Three: Keep Your
text: Eyes Moving.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE - we're in a small classroom, where Darwan's
text: BOSS is teaching Drivers Ed. Watching the film are a
text: HOUSEWIFE, a couple of TEENAGERS, two IMMIGRANT MEN.
text: Darwan sticks his head in the room. His boss comes to the
text: rear of the classroom where he hands Darwan his paycheck.
speaker_heading: HAROLD SMITH (0.S.) (cont'd)
dialog: Four: Leave Yourself An Out. Five:
dialog: Make Sure They See You.
dialog: 8/21/13 3.
scene_heading: EXT. TAXI COMPANY - LATER — NIGHT
text: TAXI DRIVERS gas up their CABS at a pump beside the garage.
text: Darwan takes over a CAB from another driver ending his shift.
scene_heading: EXT. TAXI - A LITTLE LATER — NIGHT
text: Darwan stands outside of his cab, finishing his supper of
text: fritters and puffed bread from an Indian deli. A radio
text: station plays INDIAN POP MUSIC. A KHANDA, a Sikh talisman,
text: hangs from the rear view mirror.
text: ANGLE ON HIS ID CARD mounted on the Plexiglass barrier behind
text: his head. We see his PHOTO and the name "SINGH, DARWAN."
text: WIDE EXTERIOR - Darwan's cab is parked near the entrance to
text: the QUEENSBOROUGH BRIDGE where he can see the always-—
text: spectacular NIGHT SKYLINE OF MANHATTAN.
text: The "ON DUTY" SIGN on top of Darwan's cab LIGHTS UP. He pulls
text: the taxi out and joins the line of CARS inching up to the
dialog: bridge.
text: Close in on the cabs rooftop sign going on and off
dialog: continuously, driving around the city. (As if picking up and
dialog: dropping off passengers. Until...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, EAST SIDE - LATER — NIGHT
text: MAN tears out of an upscale restaurant, his arm up.
text: Darwan stops. The man (TED) jumps in the back, SLAMMING the
text: door.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI — CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hudson and Jane! Quick!
text: Darwan throws the meter, touches his foot to the accelerator--
text: when the REAR DOOR FLINGS OPEN again. A Woman (WENDY) hurls
text: herself onto the seat next to Ted. Both are in their 40's.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: How dare you run out on me!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You threw a bottle at me.
dialog: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8/21/13 4.
text: CONTINUED:
text: Darwan drives on, checking his rear mirror nervously. The
text: woman's face is contorted with anger; the man is stoic.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Brilliant maneuver! Inform me our
dialog: marriage is over, in a public
dialog: restaurant, so I can't make a scene
dialog: -- and you thought that would
dialog: work?! I wish my aim was better,
dialog: you bastard ---
text: Her arm swoops out to hit him; he catches her wrist, throws
text: her back.
text: DARWAN tries to distract them, to defuse the fireworks.
speaker_heading: DARWAN
dialog: Excuse me, you said Hudson and Jane
dialog: Street?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (to Ted)
dialog: Is that where she lives? You
dialog: cocksucker!
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I'm not going home with you.
text: The woman's fury gives way to tears.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Why? Why? You can't just -- twenty-
dialog: one years, Ted! How long have you
dialog: been lying to me?
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: I didn't lie.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No, you just didn't say anything,
dialog: so how could I possibly know
dialog: anything was wrong, and now you
dialog: blindside me --
text: Ted turns to her, his voice thick with rage, shaking his
text: finger in her face.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Blindside?! When do you ever notice
dialog: anything, Wendy?
dialog: (MORE )
dialog: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8/21/13 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: TED (cont'd)
dialog: On that rare occasion when you look
dialog: up from your books or your fucking
dialog: computer, you look right through
dialog: me! I felt like a ghost!
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Well, I'm seeing through you now
dialog: and you're a prick!
dialog: (more sobs; then: )
dialog: What is she, one of your students?
text: He looks out the window, ignoring her.
speaker_heading: WENDY (cont'd)
dialog: That's as good as a yes. Bet you
dialog: "supervised her orals"! Bet she was
dialog: on her knees for that! God damn
dialog: you --
text: She swings again, and WHOP! connects this time with his eye.
text: He lets out a YELP, pushes her away, fending off her blows.
text: DARWAN'S EYES widen in the rear mirror, watching them
text: struggle.
text: Ted breaks away, shouting to the driver:
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Pull over! Let me out here!
text: As the cab slows, Wendy clings to Ted.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Please! Ted! Come home, we'll talk--
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: It won't do any good.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I don't understand -- why? Why?
text: The taxi stops near the curb.
text: Ted is out the door, SLAMMING it firmly. He thrusts cash at
text: Darwan through the window.
speaker_heading: TED
dialog: Take her to 600 West 98th.
text: Wendy throws open the door again to follow him. Ted pushes it
text: closed, blocking it with his body as he calls to Darwan:

dialog: 8/21/13 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3) 8
speaker_heading: TED (cont'd)
dialog: Go! Go!
text: Darwan pulls the taxi away quickly. The momentum bounces her
text: back on the cushion, where she lets out a long, wounded WAIL.
text: Darwan maintains a pained silence as he drives the woman
text: home. He glances now and then in the rear mirror to see her
text: crumpled up and SOBBING without restraint.
scene_heading: EXT. WENDY'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT 9
text: Darwan pulls up in front of a narrow three-story brownstone.
speaker_heading: DARWAN
dialog: We are here. Number six hundred.
text: Wendy stuffs a twenty in his tray and gets out. Her face is
text: obscured but he can tell she's crying. As she stumbles to her
text: door, Darwan jumps out with the money.
speaker_heading: DARWAN (cont'd)
dialog: No, please. He paid me already --
text: But Wendy is already inside, and the door SLAMS shut.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL - WENDY'S HOUSE —- CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 10
text: 
text: Wendy flicks on the LIGHT and stands numbly in the hall. We
text: get a better look at her. Fierce eyes in a soft, vulnerable
text: face. Attractive but careless about her looks.
text: The hallway is lined with bookcases. Piles of messengered
text: books and mail are on the hall table, and a bowl full of keys
text: and coins. Seen through an open door, the living room is full
text: of dusty Danish-modern furniture, and like the hall is
text: cluttered with books, on shelves and on every surface.
text: Wendy's eyes fall to the two tennis racquets leaning against
text: the wall. They lift to the framed PHOTO of her with Ted, a
text: little girl (TASHA) between them, laughing on top of some
text: mountain. She shakes her head in mute disbelief.
text: She walks mechanically to the coat closet. Removing her
text: jacket, she hangs it up, then pauses at the sight of the
text: empty hanger for his coat.
scene_heading: INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT 11
text: 
text: She opens the door, steps in, and stares at the bed.

scene_heading: CONTINUED: 11
text: WENDY'S POV (FANTASY) - Ted lounges in bed, wearing an old t-
text: shirt, grading test papers. He doesn't look up. RUNNING WATER
text: O.S.... WE PAN TO THE OPEN BATHROOM DOOR. Ted's in there, his
text: back to her, bare butt peeking from under the torn t-shirt,
text: brushing his teeth, the faucet running.... FOOTSTEPS BEHIND
speaker_heading: HER O.S.
text: WENDY turns toward the sound, in the doorway.
text: WENDY'S POV - Ted's going downstairs, into the darkness...A
text: beat...The front door CLOSES WITH A LOUD REPORT --
text: -- shattering her fantasy. She starts to hyperventilate,
text: gasping for breath. Then she rushes past the empty bed, into
text: the empty bathroom. We hear her VOMITING into the toilet.
scene_heading: EXT. TAXI COMPANY - LATER — PRE-DAWN 12
text: Back in Queens, Darwan returns the taxi. He removes his
text: belongings, and checks the rear seat. He sees a PADDED
text: ENVELOPE ON THE FLOOR. One of his passengers must have left
dialog: something.
text: There is no name on the outside of the envelope. The flap is
text: open. He slips his hand in and pulls out a new HARDCOVER
text: BOOK. A letter is clipped to the dustcover.
text: We SKIM DOWN the letter as he reads. The letterhead is a book
text: publisher, addressed to a WENDY SHIELDS, The New Yorker,
text: "Enclosed is a copy of BEATITUDES for your review...." and an
text: editor's sticky note on top reads: "Messenger to 600 West 98
dialog: st."
speaker_heading: OMITTED 13
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, RICHMOND HILL —- LATER — EARLY A.M. 14
text: The envelope tucked under his arm, Darwan walks wearily up a
text: residential street; past small, drab one-family homes built
text: in the 30's. Only a few other people are on the street this
text: early, all bearded MEN in turbans like Darwan, jackets over
text: long shirts: this is the Punjabi Sikh neighborhood in Queens.
text: Darwan enters the basement apartment of a two-story clapboard
text: house, unpainted in a decade.
dialog: 15
dialog: 8/21/13 8.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT —- MINUTES LATER — EARLY A.M. 15
text: We TRACK WITH DARWAN through the one-bedroom apartment. He
text: passes the open bathroom door where a SIKH MAN, barechested
text: from his shower, winds his turban around his long hair which
text: is knotted on top of his head.
text: Darwan glances inside a tiny bedroom, where ANOTHER SIKH MAN
text: is asleep in the one bed. Darwan's 23-year-old nephew PREET,
text: dressed in construction clothes, is rolling up his mattress
text: on the floor.
speaker_heading: DARWAN
dialog: (WHISPERS )
dialog: Preet.
text: The boy doesn't hear at first, his ears blocked by the
text: earbuds from the iPod in his pocket.
speaker_heading: DARWAN (cont'd)
dialog: Preet!
text: Preet looks up, smiling sheepishly as he pulls out the
text: earbuds. He joins Darwan in the hallway.
speaker_heading: PREET
dialog: Hey. I got another job. Big
dialog: renovation, four weeks —
speaker_heading: DARWAN
dialog: (interrupts; re: iPod)
dialog: Where did you get that?
speaker_heading: PREET
dialog: I paid for it.
speaker_heading: DARWAN
dialog: Preet, you must save your money.
speaker_heading: PREET
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Uncle D, no. I must have music.
speaker_heading: DARWAN
dialog: And turn that around.
text: Darwan is referring to Preet's head wrap which is knotted in
text: the back gangsta-style.
speaker_heading: DARWAN (cont'd)
dialog: If you can't wear it properly, then
dialog: put on the dastaar. [turban]

scene_heading: CONTINUED: 15
text: Preet wags his finger playfully under Darwan's nose.
speaker_heading: PREET
dialog: Uncle D, it's past your bedtime.
text: Darwan has to smile. He raps his knuckle on Preet's head and
text: lets him go.
text: As Preet exits for work, Darwan proceeds into the living
text: room, where a THIRD SIKH MAN is rising from his bed on the
text: couch. Too tired to talk, Darwan nods at him, taking his
text: place on the couch while the other man pads, yawning, to the
dialog: bathroom.
text: Darwan PLACES THE PADDED ENVELOPE CAREFULLY ON THE TEA TABLE,
text: then burrows under the blanket. Darwan then starts
text: unravelling his turban.

text: ROSE (55) and WENDY, all seated at a round table.
text: Wendy has made an attempt to pull herself together, but she
text: seems harried and unfocussed. Self-medication: a very tall
text: takeout container of COFFEE she's downing.
text: The Engineer exits to the glass control BOOTH. Rose leans
text: over to whisper to Wendy.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I heard about you and Ted. I'm
dialog: really sorry.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (recoils)
dialog: You heard what, exactly?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (on the spot)
dialog: Well - that you -

speaker_heading: ENGINEER (0.S.)

speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Joining me for today's topic "Are
dialog: Critics Necessary?" are three
dialog: columnists from the New Yorker:
dialog: film critic Howard Mintz, art
dialog: critic Rose Belknap, and Wendy
dialog: Shields, who reviews books. Let's
dialog: start with Wendy. No child dreams
dialog: of becoming a literary critic, so

speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: What current authors do you enjoy
dialog: reviewing?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Well, Martin Amis, Toni Morrison,
dialog: uh...Delia Krauss -
text: Suddenly the other guests go tense, exchanging alarmed
text: glances; Rose looks dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
dialog: - I especially love her short
dialog: stories. The magazine publishes
dialog: most of them -
text: Wendy notices the others’ reactions. She laughs uncertainly.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT’D) (cont’d)
dialog: What, nobody likes Delia Krauss?
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR BANK —- LATER — DAY 16B
text: ANGLE ON WENDY AND ROSE waiting for the elevator, backs to

speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: DeeDee Krauss?! That whore?!
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: We thought you knew.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I thought it was one of Ted’s
dialog: students. Now I get it. She was
dialog: Writer-in-Residence last year.
dialog: (fake-laughing)
dialog: She plowed through half the

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (over her shoulder)
dialog: Are you heading to the office?
text: ANGLE ON WENDY - she doesn’t respond for a half-beat, rooted
text: to the spot, as the shock enters her heart.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (distantly)
dialog: No, I’m going to work at home...for
dialog: a while...
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - WENDY'S HOUSE - DAY 17
text: Wendy sits in an easy chair, humped over a book, rapidly
text: reading and making notes. There are stacks of review books
text: everywhere. It's dark and hermetic; her computer SCREEN GLOWS
text: on the desk, amid coffee-stained mugs, plates with food
dialog: crumbs.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Mom?
text: Wendy looks up.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL - WENDY'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - DAY 18

speaker_heading: TASHA

dialog: It's a band. You're such a ditz.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, WENDY'S HOUSE - LATER —- DAY 19
text: The counters are cluttered with takeout cartons and dirty
text: dishes. As her daughter chatters, Wendy washes out two mugs
text: while the water kettle heats up.
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: They don't use any chemical sprays
dialog: or fertilizers. I love being up in
dialog: the tractor, I love the air and the
dialog: smells, I love dirt. Growing up in
dialog: the city I always thought dirt was,
dialog: like, grime. But their dirt is
dialog: alive, you know, it's rich, it's
dialog: nourishing --I just want to eat it.
speaker_heading: WENDY

text: fire. The WHISTLE DIES. Tasha pours water in the mugs.
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: He said to ask you.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Stands to reason, seeing I'm the
dialog: one paying your tuition. Well, do
dialog: as you like. Vermont suits you. You
text: look dangerously healthy.
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: Mom, come stay with me. They'll put
dialog: you up on the farm. It's a great
dialog: place to write.
speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: So get one!
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Tasha, please let’s not get into
dialog: that, not again, not now.

speaker_heading: Eew.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Please don't be so upset.
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: I thought you'd be upset.
text: Wendy sets a tray as she breezily dismisses Tasha's concern.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: We've weathered this before. Every
dialog: seven years, the itch comes over
dialog: him. He gets restless, does
dialog: something juvenile. So, at twenty-
dialog: one years, we're on our third itch.
dialog: Or it's male menopause. Instead of
dialog: buying a a motorcycle, Daddy
dialog: decided to give adultery a spin.
text: As she heads into the living room with the tray:

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, WENDY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 20

speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: Mom...Dad's not coming home.
speaker_heading: WENDY

dialog: you.
text: She sips her tea but it burns her tongue. She BANGS her mug
text: down and erupts.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: WENDY (cont'd)
dialog: I hope she knows she'll have to pay
dialog: for his keep. Because he is a
dialog: loser. In twenty years he couldn't
dialog: get tenure. How anyone besides me
dialog: could consider him romantic
text: material is stupefying.
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: So you are upset.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: No I'm not. I'm disgusted.
speaker_heading: WENDY (cont'd)
dialog: You're staying for dinner?
speaker_heading: TASHA
dialog: Actually, I said I'd eat with Dad.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: (fury rising again)
dialog: So this is just a visit. You're

dialog: Miss!
text: She gestures her glass for a refill, well on her way to a

speaker_heading: WENDY (cont'd)
dialog: Just tell me: if she ever
dialog: disappointed you, if she ever fell

speaker_heading: DARWAN
dialog: No. I would never.
speaker_heading: WENDY

speaker_heading: WENDY (cont'd)

speaker_heading: DARWAN (cont'd)

dialog: the same things at all. She's
dialog: scared of America. She's scared of
dialog: me. She hides. You know words,
dialog: Wendy. What do I say?
text: She thinks. When she speaks at last, it's from the bruised
dialog: heart.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: That you'll never stop trying. That
dialog: you'll fight for her. Every day,
dialog: you'll try to cross the divide.
dialog: Tell her she's worth it.
speaker_heading: DARWAN
dialog: Is this what you wanted to hear
dialog: from him?
text: She SIGHS, averting her eyes to hold tears at bay.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Not words. You know what I miss?
dialog: The way he touched my face.
dialog: Just...holding my face between his

speaker_heading: WENDY (cont'd)
dialog: Thank you. You did your best.
speaker_heading: DARWAN
dialog: Not enough.
text: A beat. He slowly brings his hands toward her. And gently
text: touches the sides of her face. As if she is treasure.
text: She releases a pained breath. She turns her face into his
text: touch, leaning one cheek on his palm.
text: He pulls his hands away. His face shows the struggle within.
speaker_heading: DARWAN (cont'd)
dialog: Goodbye, Wendy.

dialog: her the box.
speaker_heading: JASLEEN
dialog: Where is...?
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
dialog: I can't read that.
