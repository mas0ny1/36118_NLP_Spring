speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: I know. I’m sorry. Something’s

speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: SADNESS

speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: SADNESS

speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: JOY (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s cool umbrellas, lightning

speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Oh, hey, hey... easy. Why are you
dialog: crying? That’s really the opposite

speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: Crying helps me slow down and
text: obsess over the weight of life's
dialog: problems.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Ugh, you know what? Let’s think

scene_heading: INSIDE OUT 66.
speaker_heading: BING BONG

speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: What exactly are you supposed to

speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: You know, it’s unclear. I’m mostly

dialog: part cat, part elephant, part
dialog: dolphin.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Dolphin?
text: Bing Bong does a spot-on dolphin impression.
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: You gotta remember, when Riley was
dialog: three, animals were all the rage.
text: The cow goes moo. The horse goes
dialog: neigh. That’s all people talked
dialog: about back then.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Yeah, I guess that’s true. What are
dialog: you doing out here?
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: Well, there’s not much call for

speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: SADNESS

speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: I cry candy. Try the caramel, it’s

speaker_heading: BING BONG (CONT'D)
dialog: What? It’s imaginary.
text: Joy accepts the satchel and puts in the core memories.
speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: Well, it kind of goes all over the

speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: I’m so glad we ran into you!

speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: The station is right through here.
text: The train station is visible through a door on the other side.
speaker_heading: BING BONG (CONT'D)
dialog: After you.
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: Joy...
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: I read about this place in the

speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Bing Bong says it’s the quickest
dialog: way to Headquarters.
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: No, but Joy, this is Abstract
dialog: Thought.
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: What’re you talking about? I go in

text: He points to a “Danger” sign above the door.
speaker_heading: BING BONG (CONT'D)
scene_heading: D-A-N-G-E-R: shortcut. I’1ll prove

speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: Let’s go around. This way.
text: She points: the building is huge -- it’s a long way around.
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: Almost there...!
text: Joy looks back at Bing Bong. The station is right there.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: (to Sadness)
dialog: If you want to walk the long way,

dialog: happy. I’m not missing that train.
dialog: (walks in)
dialog: Bing Bong knows what he’s doing.
dialog: He's part dolphin. They're very
dialog: smart.
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: Well, I guess...
text: She climbs in.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL LUNCH YARD —- LUNCHTIME

speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Whoa! What's happening?!
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: Oh no. They turned it on.
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: Huh! I’ve never seen this before.
text: Bing Bong’s head turns into a Picasso-like form. Joy and

speaker_heading: BING BONG (CONT'D)
dialog: My face! My beautiful face!
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: What is going on?
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: We're abstracting! There are four
dialog: stages. This is the first: non-
dialog: objective fragmentation!
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: Alright, do not panic! What is
dialog: important is that we all STAY
scene_heading: TOGETHER.
text: His arm falls off.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Ah!
text: Joy's head falls off. Sadness’ leg goes. She topples.
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: We’re in the second stage: we're
dialog: deconstructing!
scene_heading: INSIDE OUT 72.
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: Run!
text: Bing Bing falls into pieces.
speaker_heading: BING BONG (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Come here, me!
text: They gather their pieces as they rush to the exit.
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: We've gotta get out of here before

dialog: We'll get stuck here forever!
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: “Stuck?!” Why did we come in here?!
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: I told you, it’s a shortcut!
text: Though the window, the TRAIN OF THOUGHT pulls in.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: The train!
text: POP! They change into FLAT COLOR VERSIONS of themselves.
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: Oh no... We’re two-dimensional!
dialog: That’s stage three!
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: We're getting nowhere!
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: Depth! I’m lacking depth!
text: It’s hard to move. They struggle towards the window.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Come on!
text: Sadness and Bing Bong follow and try to squeeze through. But
text: because of the broken perspective, they are now all HUGE
text: compared to the door.
scene_heading: INSIDE OUT 73.
speaker_heading: JOY (CONT'D)
dialog: AUGH! We can’t fit!
text: POP! They abstract into ABSTRACT COLORED BLOBS.
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: Oh no, we're nonfigurative. This is
dialog: the last stage!
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: We're not going to make it!
text: Sadness slumps to the ground... and becomes a line!
speaker_heading: SADNESS
dialog: Wait! We’re two dimensional. Fall
dialog: on your face!
dialog: (crawls like an inchworm)
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Ooh!
text: They follow Sadness and inch safely out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. ABSTRACT THOUGHT BUILDING
text: The three lines land outside just as the train pulls out.
text: They get up to go, but as lines they can barely move.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: Wait! Stop! Stop! STOP!
text: POP! Joy goes from non-representational to two-dimensional.
text: She falls down flat as the train speeds off.
text: POP! The three transform back to normal.
speaker_heading: JOY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Bing Bong)
dialog: I thought you said that was a
dialog: shortcut.
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: I did, but wow, we should NOT have
dialog: gone in there. That was dangerous!
dialog: They really should put up a sign.
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: How long till the next train?
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: Who knows? But don’t worry. There’s
dialog: another station. That way!

speaker_heading: BING BONG

text: Joy has lost everything.
text: Around her, memories fade and disappear.
text: A tear falls onto the faded TWISTY-TREE MEMORY. Joy wipes it.
dialog: 108.
scene_heading: INSIDE OUT 109.

text: Joy looks closer. What's this? She rewinds more.
text: IN THE MEMORY: Riley sits in the tree, crying, alone.

speaker_heading: JOY

text: Not even close. They crash back to the bottom.
speaker_heading: JOY (CONT'D)
dialog: c'mon!
scene_heading: EXT. MEMORY DUMP - MOMENTS LATER
text: They shoot down a taller hill for another go. They SING

text: Bing Bong stands. There’s no way they’ll make it. He looks
text: up at the ledge and then to his hand -- it’s disappearing!
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: Come on, Joy. One more time. I’ve
dialog: got a feeling about this one.
scene_heading: EXT. MEMORY DUMP - MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: INSIDE OUT 111.
speaker_heading: BING BONG
dialog: Louder! Louder, Joy! Sing louder!
text: Bing Bong times it just right... and jumps out of the wagon.

speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: We’re gonna make it!
text: The rocket makes it over the ledge! It crashes atop the

speaker_heading: JOY (CONT'D)
dialog: Woohoo! Bing Bong, we did it! We--

speaker_heading: JOY (CONT'D)
