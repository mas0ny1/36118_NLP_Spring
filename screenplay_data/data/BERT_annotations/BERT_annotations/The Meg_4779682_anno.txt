scene_heading: EXT. PUDONG SKYLINE - SUNRISE
text: The silhouette of the majestic Pearl Tower tells us we are in
text: SHANGHAI, just as day breaks. TWO BLACKED-OUT SUVs glide
text: through a city that’s at once both ancient and modern.
text: The CONVOY passes:
text: The lights of Nanjing Road, shutting off with the dawn...
text: Students practicing sunrise Tai Chi along the Huangpu river...
text: The CONVOY continues past:
text: Antique vendors on Dongtai Road, setting up for the day’s
dialog: business...
text: Eager chefs negotiating with seasoned fishermen for the prize
dialog: catch at a local fish market...
scene_heading: EXT. THE DONGHAI BRIDGE - CONTINUED
text: The TWO SUVs cut through a morning fog that gives this bridge
text: the appearance of stretching to infinity...
scene_heading: EXT. YANGSHAN PORT - CONTINUED
text: The JOURNEY ENDS at one of the world’s busiest ports, where
text: both SUVs come to a STOP, and the RED-CARPET BOARDING STAIRS
text: of an AUGUSTA-WESTLAND AW101 HELICOPTER - the most expensive
text: rotorcraft ever made - beckons all to board.
scene_heading: EXT. HELIPAD, YANGSHUN PORT - MOMENTS LATER
text: The helicopter lifts off, leaving the port and its off-shore
text: wind turbines behind. And heading out to sea...
text: EXT. A WHALE WATCHING BOAT - OFF OF HAINAN ISLAND
text: Tourists, angling to get the best photographs of a pod of
text: whales, HARDLY NOTICE THE HELICOPTER as it speeds by...
scene_heading: EXT. SANYA BAY BEACHES - HAINAN ISLAND
dialog: And neither do the sun-worshipping beachgoers, nor the high-
text: spirited water lovers who surf the breaks.
text: Only a LONE BOY looks up, shielding his eyes from the sun, to
text: admire the HELICOPTER as it speeds by over the lush, tropical
text: isle and heads out INTO THE VAST PACIFIC...
speaker_heading: A WOMAN’S VOICE
dialog: Imagine going to the moon...
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY
text: The Helicopter flies low across the surface of the water.
text: Endless blue as far as the eye can see....
speaker_heading: A WOMAN’S VOICE
dialog: But instead of it being a lifeless
dialog: void, it was teeming with creatures
text: so exotic, they boggle the mind.
scene_heading: INT. AUGUSTA-WESTLAND AW101 HELICOPTER - DAY
text: The voice belongs to PRESCA MORRIS, an immaculately dressed,
text: incredibly charismatic businesswoman. She’s speaking to her
text: passengers for the day: EIGHT INTERNATIONAL VIPs -(whose
dialog: personal fortunes come from American oil money, Mexican
dialog: telecom, Brazilian Manufacturing, and Indian petrochemicals)
speaker_heading: MORRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Imagine exploring an alien world,
dialog: whose scale dwarfs the highest of
text: mountains, the grandest of canyons.
dialog: Now imagine, instead of this being
dialog: a fantasy, instead of it being a
dialog: journey that would take years to
dialog: complete, you could do it right
dialog: here, right now. Ladies and
dialog: Gentlemen, I welcome you, our first
text: outside guests, to Mana-One.
text: THROUGH THE LARGE CABIN WINDOWS
text: The VIPs see MANA-ONE, a PLATFORM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN.
text: It’s industrial-looking, sits low in the water, and is little
text: more than a wide, square landing area with docks/sub-
text: launching arms protruding from each of its four sides.
speaker_heading: TEXAS VIP
dialog: (disappointed, to his Wife)
dialog: That's it?
scene_heading: EXT. HELICOPTER / EXT. MANA-ONE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Morris leads the VIPs across the deck, heading for the only
text: visible structure, a BANK OF ELEVATORS, that sticks up on the
text: otherwise flat platform, like some kind of design mistake.
scene_heading: MRS. TEXAS VIP
dialog: (to Morris)
dialog: Obviously, when you get closer to
dialog: completion, you’re gonna do this
dialog: up, right?
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: No.
text: No? Did they hear that right? The ELEVATOR door opens, and
dialog: if the VIPs thought that the platform was disappointing...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUED
text: ...Then the ELEVATOR takes that to another level. It’s a
dialog: massive freight lift - the kind you’d find in a garment
text: warehouse. The only clue that there is something more going
dialog: on here is that Morris is holding out STICKS OF--
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Chewing gum, anyone? For your
dialog: ears. I recommend it. The first
dialog: time down can be a bit much.
dialog: And so this group of people, collectively worth 1/4 of a
text: TRILLION DOLLARS, take sticks of 99-cent chewing gum.
speaker_heading: TEXAS VIP
dialog: Are we on candid camera or
dialog: something?
text: Morris selects the “0” floor, using an old-fashion hand-crank
text: selector. DOWN they go. Fast.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Your ears are popping because, even
text: though the station is normalized,
dialog: pressure changes underwater are much
text: greater than they are in the air. A
text: Scuba diver, rising from the depth
dialog: we're going to, would have to spend
dialog: hours in a decompression tank or die
dialog: a painful death. Then again, no
dialog: scuba diver has ever been as deep as
dialog: you're about to be.
text: They reach the O-level. The elevator stops with a LURCH.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Your gum?
text: Morris holds out a CHEAP PLASTIC CONTAINER for those who want
dialog: to get rid of their gum. That’s the last straw for TEXAS.
speaker_heading: TEXAS VIP
dialog: I’ve got to be honest with you, Ms.
dialog: Morris. So far I find this whole
dialog: thing profoundly underwhelming--
dialog: 4.
text: --as if on cue the ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN to reveal A HUMPBACK
text: WHALE gliding gracefully by right in front of them. ITS SONG
text: fills the elevator as A SECOND HUMPBACK, a BABY, slides by.
speaker_heading: MINWAY ZHANG (0.S.)
dialog: Then it’s a good thing it’s not the
dialog: elevator you’re here to see.
text: DR. MINWAY ZHANG - 60s, but brimming with the enthusiasm of a
dialog: child, has been waiting for them here on the--
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL (O-LEVEL) - MANA #1 - DAY
text: An all-glass world - shaped like a massive horizontal bicycle
text: wheel. Its six “spokes” are corridors, and its “rim” is more
text: than 1/4 mile around in its entirety. The result is a view
text: of sea life in every direction. A 360 degree aquarium called
dialog: the Pacific Ocean.
speaker_heading: MINWAY ZHANG
dialog: You are looking at something few
dialog: people have ever seen. Life 1,000
text: feet beneath the surface...
text: Standing next to Zhang, his granddaughter MEIYING, 8, seems
text: to take delight in watching the VIPs’ jaws drop.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: On behalf of my granddaughter,
dialog: Meiying, I welcome you to the
dialog: Observation Level. A structure
dialog: designed with the knowledge that
dialog: nothing man makes will ever compete
text: with the majesty of the sea.
speaker_heading: END CREDITS
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL (O-LEVEL) - MANA #1 - DAY
text: We WALK with the group as Zhang leads them around a portion
text: of the O-Level. Pausing to point out certain species of sea
text: life as they make appearances outside the glass.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
text: Mana-one’s location, on the edge of
dialog: a tectonic shelf, means we get an
text: incredible variety of aquatic life.
dialog: From something as common as the
dialog: Bluefin Tuna...
dialog: (two 800-lbs glide by)
dialog: ...to something as rare and
dialog: spectacular as...
text: .--He nods for Meiying to identify what she sees outside:
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: (excited)
dialog: An oarfish!
text: Gasps are heard as the VIPs see AN OARFISH: a 35-ft long
text: silvery ribbon of life with a dragon’s head.
speaker_heading: INDIAN VIP
dialog: This is incredible, Dr. Zhang.
speaker_heading: BRAZILIAN VIP
dialog: Truly spectacular.
speaker_heading: TEXAS VIP
dialog: How long ‘til you open up to paying
dialog: customers?
text: Zhang looks to Morris. Those details are her department.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Ten months. In addition to this
dialog: level, we're building a restaurant
dialog: we think has the world’s greatest
text: view, a hospital-quality infirmary,
text: and most importantly, a gift shop.
dialog: That gets laughs.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: For years, I’ve traveled the world,
dialog: urging people to take better care
dialog: of the sea. My hope is now, by
dialog: bringing the world here, the sea
dialog: will speak for itself.
text: There is some spontaneous applause for the achievement.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: (Prompting Zhang)
dialog: So, it’s no accident we invited you
dialog: all here today...
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: ...Yes. As you may remember, Mana-
dialog: One is built where it is to give us
dialog: access to the deepest reaches of
dialog: our planet. The Marianas Trench.
text: Nearly seven miles below the
text: surface at its base, the mysteries
text: of the trench hold the keys to a
dialog: better understanding of the world
dialog: in which we live. And yet it
dialog: remains a place mankind has seen
dialog: less of than the planet Mars. Our
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: ZHANG (CONT'D)
dialog: mission is to change that. Right
dialog: now, as I speak to you, a team of
dialog: our submersibles, including one
dialog: piloted by my daughter, is putting
dialog: the last of our UNIS BOT sensor
text: stations in place, 30,000 feet
dialog: below us. When powered up, these
dialog: BOTS will send back images, the
dialog: likes of which no one has seen
dialog: before. And we want you, our angel
dialog: investors, to be with us when we
text: turn them on for the first time.
text: Now everyone is really jazzed. TEXAS VIP looks at Morris.
speaker_heading: TEXAS VIP
dialog: Well played, little lady. Well
dialog: played.
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MANA-1, DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
text: Zhang, Morris, Meiying and the VIPs emerge from the elevator
text: and find themselves in a Mission-Control like space, known as
scene_heading: the DIVE CONTROL CENTER (DCC). A small TEAM OF PERSONNEL
dialog: (who we'll get to know) is monitoring every aspect of the
text: current mission into the trench. A dazzling array of video
text: screens shows us everything from the CREW MEMBERS’ VITAL
text: SIGNS, to IMAGES FROM INSIDE THE SUBS, and of course, IMAGES
text: OF WHAT’S OUTSIDE THE SUBS.
text: A TACTICAL DISPLAY shows a computer representation of the
text: dive going on right now. Two sleek ABYSS GLIDERS (Fastback 1
text: and Fastback 2) are orbiting at 20,000 feet down, acting like
text: sonar eyes in the sky for the two MULE SUBS (Angel 1 and
text: Angel 2) that are actually in the trench placing the last of
text: the UNIS BOTS into position.
text: The DIVE OPERATIONS CHIEF, James “MAC” Mackriedes, 30s, rough
text: around the edges, nods ‘hello’ to the VIPs and then resumes
dialog: what he’s doing.
speaker_heading: JAMES “MAC” MACKRIEDES
dialog: (into a mic)
dialog: Angel one, have you got that last
dialog: bot in position?
text: ANGEL ONE, the first of the Mules, is captained by JUNJIE
text: Chen and co-piloted by CARL Sheppherd. We see their cockpit
text: on a screen. There’s a delay between the video and audio:
speaker_heading: JUNJIE/ANGEL ONE (RADIO)
text: Standby... Bot is down. Footpad
dialog: indicator. four greens. Inertial
text: Power Unit: on. Tether: released.
dialog: 
text: The TACTICAL DISPLAY shows ANGEL ONE is no longer tethered to
text: its UNIS BOT cargo. And that the BOT is well-positioned in
text: the trench. This gets the room excited.
speaker_heading: JUNJIE/ANGEL ONE (RADIO)
dialog: Well everyone, it looks like we owe
dialog: Dimitri an apology. His stuff
dialog: might actually work.
text: He’s referring to DIMITRI Karmanov, the handsome, blue-eyed
text: Russian Engineer who is watching the dive from a seat next to
text: Mac. Mac pats Dimitri on the back. Dimitri is emotionless.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Fan, let’s go ahead and ping the
dialog: BOTS so we can start them up.
text: This to Linfan “FAN” Chang, 24, a marine biologist whose arms
text: are covered in decorative tattoos of mermaids and sea
dialog: creatures. Fan is Meiying’s favorite team member, (besides
text: her mom and grandpa), so it’s no surprise that Meiying has
text: joined her at the control panel. Fan enters a series of
text: commands on her keyboard.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Wake-up boys... Give us a smile...
speaker_heading: ON TACTICAL
text: One by one, the two dozen BOTS, which have been placed in
text: tandem along a length of the trench, BEGIN TO BLINK.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: All Bots responding. Initial
dialog: readings - nominal. Ready for
dialog: power-up on your command.
text: Fan looks at Mac, but then Mac, and everyone, looks at ZHANG.
text: This moment is the culmination of years of hard work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Go ahead, please.
text: Dimitri and Fan rapidly execute a series of keystrokes - then
text: reach the final button-push. Fan turns to MEIYING. Let’s
text: push this last button together. As they do, Fan says...
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Let there be light.
text: A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS BETWEEN POVS.
dialog: 1) From Junjie’s and Francois’s MULES (Angel One and Two) -
text: hovering in the trench. They stare into the darkness - but
dialog: see NOTHING yet.
text: 2) From an ABYSS GLIDER (Fastback One) orbiting above,
text: piloted by SUYIN Zhang -- late 20s, beautiful and brilliant.
text: Suyin looks down out the bottom of her glass cockpit. She
text: sees the faint blinking position lights of the two Mules far
text: below... But NOTHING else.
text: BACK IN THE DIVE CONTROL CENTER
text: THE TACTICAL DISPLAY shows all BOTS turning from Red to
dialog: Green, meaning they should be on... But...
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: No visuals from BOT cameras. No
dialog: data either.
text: Is it possible something isn’t working? Mac looks at
dialog: Dimitri. Dimitri stares, it will be fine.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (nervous, into the mic)
dialog: Angel One, do you have a visual?
dialog: (static)
dialog: Junjie, I say again, do you have a
dialog: visual?
dialog: (static)
dialog: Suyin, can you see anything from up
dialog: where you are?
text: Silence. It’s horrible. Mac is about to speak again when--
speaker_heading: JUNJIE/ANGEL ONE (RADIO)
dialog: --Mana-One, confirmed. The BOTS
dialog: are working...
speaker_heading: JUNJIE’S POV
text: In the inky black reaches just below him, he now sees a
text: series of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS - orbs in the darkness.
speaker_heading: JUNJIE/ANGEL ONE
dialog: Not sure our cameras will do them
dialog: justice. From here it looks like
dialog: someone dropped the two most
dialog: beautiful diamond necklaces you
dialog: ever saw.
speaker_heading: SUYIN’S POV
text: From up here, it almost looks like an airport runway at
text: night. Suyin breaks into a big smile.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Congratulations, father. You did it.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
text: Applause breaks out. Zhang, beaming...
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: We did it. All of us.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: And we have visuals. Welcome,
dialog: everyone, to the most exotic place
dialog: on planet Earth...
text: The VISUALS begin to explode onto the DCC SCREENS. This is
text: the Marianas Trench as we have never seen it. CORAL TOWERS
text: reach skyward like church spires. ACTIVE VOLCANOES spew
text: plumes of deadly sulfur. And STRANGE, ALIEN CREATURES haunt
text: the waters. Bleach white cephalopods, invertebrates. Then--
text: --A SCREAM FROM ONE OF THE VIPs WHEN an ANGLER FISH appears
text: on screen, like something out of a nightmare! That gives
text: everyone a good scare. Then more LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Have no fear. That Angler Fish is
dialog: only 6 inches long. And it’s six
dialog: miles beneath us.
text: There’s a MOMENT where everyone just marvels at what they
text: see. Is that a tear in ZHANG’S eye? MAC and HELLER embrace.
text: FAN reaches out and surreptitiously SQUEEZES DIMITRI’S HAND -
text: a secret romance between the fiery gal and icy Russian.
dialog: PING...
text: Amidst the celebratory laughs, a lone SONAR PING.
dialog: And then another...
dialog: PING...
speaker_heading: FAN (MIC)
dialog: Fastbacks One and Two. You guys
dialog: see that?
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN - SAME
text: Suyin looks around. Her glass cockpit has a HEADS-UP DISPLAY
text: projected on it. And sure enough it is picking up SOMETHING
text: moving fast, north to south, high to low, in the TRENCH. The
text: sub’s computer puts a little box around the ‘target’ even
text: though it can’t actually be seen.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Copy that, Mana-One. I have one...
dialog: Make that two targets...
text: More BOXES appear... Indicating more targets... But then
text: some disappear and re-appear... It’s really weird.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: DJ, you picking this up?
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ - SAME
text: “DJ" LAU, late 20s, a guy who exudes ‘cool’ in every way. DJ
text: flips a quarter through the fingers of his left hand, while
text: piloting his ship with his right.
speaker_heading: DJ
text: My sonar’s lighting up like a Vegas
dialog: casino. It’s got to be electrical
dialog: interference.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - CONTINUED
dialog: Suyin can think of one OTHER possibility.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Angels one and two - suggest ascend
dialog: 500 meters - there might be a rock
dialog: slide heading your way.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - CONTINUED
text: Rock slide? The smile from Mac’s face vanishes.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Our sonar’s picking up nothing.
dialog: And there’s no indication of
dialog: seismic activity.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (looks at Mac)
dialog: You worry too much. It’s
dialog: interference, nothing more--
text: Suddenly -- SMASH -- THERE IS A BLACK SQUARE where one of the
text: BOT CAMERAS’ FEED used to be as the SIGNAL GOES OUT. Then a
dialog: 11.
text: SECOND BOT CAMERA goes black. We see that Angler Fish
text: suddenly dart away and then THAT CAMERA TOO GOES BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL TWO - CONTINUED
text: Piloted by FRANCOIS Bernard and his brother, LUC. They are
text: in a hovering orbit, with Junjie’s Mule “Angel One” visible
text: not too far off their starboard side.
text: They watch as - one by one - THE BOTS vanish into blackness.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Mana, Angel Two. We've lost visual
text: on the Bots. All of them.
text: BACK IN THE DIVE CONTROL CENTER
text: Zhang confers with Mac. Fan and Dimitri pour over some data.
dialog: Nothing dramatic has happened up here, but the discussion
dialog: among the staff is enough to make some people wonder:
speaker_heading: INDIAN VIP
dialog: (to Morris)
dialog: Is everything okay?
text: Mac catches wind of that question. Adjusts his tie and
text: screws on the charm.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Everything is fine. The test went
dialog: perfectly. I’ve asked Dimitri to
dialog: power down the Bots so we could re-
dialog: position them. Our placement was
dialog: good, but you know Dr. Zhang, it
dialog: has to be perfect, so...
text: Morris, reading Mac, has already called for the Elevator.
dialog: She jumps in--
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: (to the VIPs)
dialog: --So we just want to say thank you,
dialog: again, for making the trip to be a
dialog: part of history. Before we take
dialog: you back to Shanghai, we do still
dialog: have one very important thing we
dialog: have to do -- raid that gift shop
text: so no one goes home empty handed.
text: The VIPs step in the ELEVATOR, the door CLOSES, they’re GONE.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Thank God the dog and pony show is
dialog: over because I haven’t cursed in
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MAC (CONT'D)
dialog: twenty minutes and I’m starting to
dialog: worry about what might come out of
dialog: my mouth. Talk to me, people.
text: Mac approaches Dimitri, who is hovering over Fan, both
text: watching the computer systems reboot. As Mac arrives he
text: “loosens”
text: his tie. Except Mac’s wearing a clip-on tie - so
text: it comes right off. Fan’s attention turns from the computer
text: screen to Mac’s absurd accessory.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: It’s like you just pulled a unicorn
dialog: off your shirt. I'd heard of clip-
dialog: on ties, but thought they were an
dialog: urban legend--
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You think my tie is the reason
text: we're staring at a wall of blank
dialog: monitors!?
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Honestly, I’m not prepared to rule
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (has the real answer)
text: The BOTS have been knocked off
dialog: their moorings. Suyin was right.
text: It must have been a landslide.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Are you saying we have to put all
dialog: the BOTS back in position?
text: Dimitri nods. That’s a lot of work. Mac turns to Zhang.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Maybe we should bring everyone up,
text: start fresh in the morning.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Sure, the BOTS are only 100 million
dialog: euros a-piece. Let’s leave them
text: unfastened at the bottom of the
dialog: trench - what could go wrong?
text: Mac doesn’t appreciate the sarcasm. But Zhang agrees with
dialog: Dimitri.
text: As does Fan. As does Mac, when he thinks about it.
speaker_heading: MAC (MIC)
dialog: Good news, gang. You’re going to
dialog: earn some overtime...
dialog: 13.
text: ZHANG crosses to HELLER at the MEDICAL MONITORING STATION.
text: They can see the divers’ heart rates, body temperature, etc.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Dr. Heller, will it be safe for
dialog: them to stay down there that long?
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: They're fine. Vitals are normal.
dialog: (tries to lighten things)
dialog: Junjie’s so relaxed, he might
text: actually be asleep.
text: Zhang smiles. He needed that. He looks over at Meiying.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Come on, sweetie, I’1l take you
dialog: back to your room. Mommy's going
dialog: to be down there a while longer.
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL ONE - CONTINUED
text: Junjie puts his Mule into a descent.
speaker_heading: JUNJIE/ANGEL ONE
dialog: Angel one. Heading back down. Try
dialog: not to crash into me, Francois. I
dialog: saw that bottle of Merlot you
text: smuggled on board.
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL TWO - CONTINUED
text: Francois puts his Mule into a descent.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS/ANGEL TWO
dialog: Angel One, I take offense to that.
dialog: No Frenchman would risk a dive for
dialog: a Merlot. Now a good Bordeaux on
dialog: the other hand...
scene_heading: EXT. WIDE SHOT - TRENCH - CONTINUED
text: We watch as the TWO MULES plunge into darkness. All is quiet
scene_heading: and peaceful UNTIL -- SOME FAST MOVING MASSIVE SHAPE --
text: glides across the FRAME and we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - A LITTLE LATER
text: Visual and Data feeds from all four subs are BREAKING UP now.
text: Pictures go FUZZY... Voices sound computer DISTORTED...
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MAC (MIC)
dialog: Angels One and Two, status?
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL TWO
text: Francois and Luc’s POV as they close in on a Bot. Their
text: search and flood lights illuminating a cone of darkness.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Coming up on a Bot. Looks like it
text: was knocked over.
speaker_heading: MAC (RADIO)
dialog: Angel 2, was it a landslide?
scene_heading: MEANWHILE - ABOVE THEM - INT. FASTBACK ONE
text: Suyin fights to steady her Abyss Glider against the current.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: DJ, current’s picking up. I’m
text: firing starboard anchor.
text: She flips a switch and...
scene_heading: EXT. FASTBACK ONE - SAME
text: An ANCHOR shoots out of the right wing-top of Suyin’s Abyss
text: Glider and lodges in the side of the vertical cliff face.
text: Then WHOOSH -- another anchor goes by and burrows into the
text: solid face -- revealing DJ'S Glider has done the same thing.
text: BELOW -- we can see the lights of Angel One and Two. Then
text: SOMETHING PASSES OVER THEM - momentarily obscuring our view.
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL ONE - CONTINUED
text: JUNJIE approaches a Bot. You can BARELY SEE ANYTHING around
text: him. The intense depth causes the HULL TO MOAN AND POP.
speaker_heading: JUNJIE
text: Through 11,000 meters. It’s pea
dialog: soup down here guys. Something
dialog: really stirred the sediment up.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS (RADIO)
dialog: Guys, this BOT is completely caved in.
text: A bead of sweat rolls down Junjie’s forehead, as his sub
text: anxiously creeps forward inches at a time. Finally, through
text: the haze of sand, the BOT COMES INTO VIEW.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JUNJIE
dialog: That’s impossible...
text: JUNJIE'S POV OF THE BOT -- It’s completely torn apart.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
text: Heller notices Junjie and Carl’s Heart rates begin to RISE...
speaker_heading: JUNJIE (RADIO - STATIC)
dialog: -..-looks like a bomb... We’re...
text: through the wreckage.... Clues.
text: Mac turns to Zhang. He’s got a bad feeling about this.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Dr. Zhang, I suggest we get our
dialog: people out of there, go back down
text: with an unmanned sub...
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL ONE
text: Junjie carefully guides his sub over the debris field.
text: WE/THEY can only see inches at a time. Carl points to
text: something that isn’t metallic grey in the wreckage.
text: It’s a WHITE TRIANGULAR OBJECT, which is partially broken,
text: that is now embedded in the side of the UNIS BOT.
speaker_heading: JUNJIE
dialog: There’s something in the bot.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
text: Mac continues his plea.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: When I hear talk of an explosion--
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: There is nothing explosive down
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: --I don’t think Junjie is making it
dialog: up, do you? Something happened.
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL ONE
text: The MYSTERIOUS OBJECT becomes more clear... There isn’t just
text: ONE TRIANGLE. There are four, five, six...
speaker_heading: JUNJIE
dialog: Oh my God...
dialog: 16.
text: Junjie and Carl are transfixed by a row of GIANT TEETH.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
text: Heller sees the HEART RATES of Junjie and Carl jump.
speaker_heading: HELLER (MIC)
dialog: Junjie, I’m seeing major spikes for
dialog: you and Carl - are you okay?
text: They get no immediate answer - so Mac makes a decision.
speaker_heading: MAC (MIC)
dialog: This is Mana-One - code BUSTER. All
text: vehicles commence ascent now.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE
text: Suyin realizes the Mules can’t hear Mac. She relays:
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Angels one and two, code Buster.
dialog: We're getting out of here.
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL ONE
text: Carl and Junjie - transfixed by the sight of the teeth.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah. I think that’s a swell idea--
text: --In_less than a tenth of a second, SOMETHING hits Angel One
text: with the force of a FREIGHT TRAIN. The sub IMPLODES, killing

scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER

speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: I’ve lost them!
speaker_heading: FAN

text: Mac's radio calls to Angel One play over:
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL TWO - CONTINUED
text: Francois and Luc are rising from the trench when suddenly Luc

dialog: 17.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
text: --Contact with Francois and Luc is lost. The DCC is in chaos.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - CONTINUED
text: Suyin can hear Mac’s frantic radio calls for Angels One and
text: Two. She’s getting very worried now.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Angel One this is Fastback, over.
dialog: Junjie, talk to me. Angel Two...
text: Then... PING - PING. Suyin’s sonar begins to identify
text: MULTIPLE TARGETS COMING UP AT HER FROM BELOW.
speaker_heading: DJ (RADIO)
dialog: Suyin, I’ve got multiple targets,
text: directly below and rising fast.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Angel One, Angel Two, come in...
speaker_heading: DJ (RADIO)
dialog: Suyin, do you hear me? We’ve got
dialog: to get out of here. Now!
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - CONTINUED
text: PING - PING - PING - as the targets get closer, the pitch of
text: the PINGS increases and the volume gets louder. DJ cuts away
text: his sub’s anchor - but sees Suyin hasn’t done the same.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Cut away or you'll be killed!
speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
dialog: You want to run, run, but I’m not
dialog: leaving them...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Yes, you are...
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
text: In an INCREDIBLE DISPLAY OF PILOTING SKILL, DJ uses the wings
text: of his Abyss Glider to BREAK SUYIN’S ANCHOR LINE.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - CONTINUED
dialog: Suyin - furious -
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: DJ, you son of a--
text: --BAM! BAM! BAM! Suyin doesn’t get to finish that thought
text: because she’s hit by RISING DEBRIS FROM JUNJIE’S SUB.
text: Instantly, her craft is damaged. Leaks spring. She begins
text: to lose air pressure. ALARMS sound everywhere.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - CONTINUED
text: DJ hasn’t fared much better. He can see systems failing. He
text: flips dozens of switches from memory as he radios a report:
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Mana-One, this is Fastback One in
dialog: the blind. Both subs have been
text: damaged, pressure vessel failing,
text: commencing emergency ascent.
text: He opens a glass panel and FLIPS a switch which turns the
text: ABYSS GLIDER into a craft as buoyant as an air balloon.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - CONTINUED
text: Through the cracking cockpit glass over her head, Suyin sees
text: DJ's Abyss Glider begin to ascend. She reaches for the same
dialog: panel he used.... And flips it.
text: SHE/WE HEAR - a muffled explosion. A compressed gas
text: cannister has inflated her emergency ascent buoys. Her sub
text: rises like a missile.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
text: Heller barks orders as he runs for the emergency lift.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: Have the decompression chamber
text: pressurized for 7,000 meters and
dialog: get all hands to the starboard
dialog: quarter for retrieval.
scene_heading: QUICK CUTS BETWEEN INT. FASTBACK ONE / INT. FASTBACK TWO
text: DJ and Suyin struggle to stay conscious and help guide their
text: subs to the surface. The pressure and rapid ascent threaten

scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE
text: We stay close on Suyin as she fades out of consciousness.
text: Her cabin is a cacophony of system alarms and warning lights.
speaker_heading: POV SUYIN
text: The pressure shift attacks Suyin’s hold on reality. Her POV
text: becomes increasingly surreal as she closes in on the Mana-
text: One. The ship lights reflect on her sub window, blinding and
dialog: heavenly. We are losing her. Her only connection to the
dialog: world those deafening warning bells. She’s surfaced but
text: doesn’t know it. Masked faces come into frame, an alien
text: intrusion into her fever dream.
speaker_heading: TO BLACK:
text: IN BLACK - we HEAR tap tap tap... tap tap tap...
scene_heading: INT. DECOMPRESSION CHAMBER - A LITTLE LATER
text: Suyin AWAKES with a start. She looks around. DJ is with
text: her. And tap tap tap - Meiying is signalling to her on the
text: glass window of the decompression chamber hatch.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Hi, sweetie!
text: They can’t hear each other, so they communicate by touching
text: hands on the glass.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: (without turning to DJ, asks)
dialog: Junjie and Carl?
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: No. But Francois and Luc are okay.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - SAME

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL TWO - STUCK ON THE BOTTOM - SAME
text: Luc looks at Francois. Nods, he tried it.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Our engines are fried, Mac. Air
dialog: pressure’s good. Hull integrity is
dialog: good. But I’m afraid you're going
dialog: to have to come get us.
speaker_heading: ZHANG (RADIO)
dialog: Any guess as to what hit you?
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS

speaker_heading: MAC

dialog: can’t leave decomp for six - so I’m
text: setting the dive for 1700 hours.
dialog: nods...
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Which gives us time to get a pilot

speaker_heading: HELLER

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: ...-We need him.
dialog: of them know who Mac means.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: Mac, I appreciate your loyalty, but
dialog: do I have to remind you what
dialog: happened the last time he went this
dialog: deep?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I don’t know what happened. And
dialog: neither do you.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: He had a psychotic episode under
dialog: pressure--
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: --That was your explanation,
dialog: doctor. Not his.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: Well - the Navy agreed with me.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Because it gave them a scapegoat.
dialog: It let them close the books on bad
dialog: mission and move on.
dialog: (to Zhang)
dialog: Dr. Zhang, a rescue like this, even
dialog: with the best equipment in the
dialog: world, is risky. If it’s me down
dialog: there, if it’s my daughter going
dialog: down there, there’s only one man on
dialog: the planet I want for the job.
scene_heading: EXT. DINOSAUR VALLEY - LUFENG - DAY
text: Wind whips across the arid ochre mesas of the Lufeng Quarry.

speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Carcharocles...
speaker_heading: PHD CANDIDATE
dialog: ...Carcharocles Megaladon.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Good, and have you measured it?
speaker_heading: PHD CANDIDATE
dialog: Eight centimeters...
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Which means...
speaker_heading: PHD CANDIDATE
dialog: It was from a juvenile, 10-12
dialog: meters in length.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Very good. But the fact that it is
text: black, fully carbonized, also
dialog: means...
text: He swings his hand axe at it... Clank... Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: You couldn't break it if you tried.
text: He gives her a friendly wink, she laughs, and he walks off.
dialog: WE WIDEN -- to see this is a permanent Archeological Dig

scene_heading: INT. TRAILER - CONTINUED
text: Jonas stares off into the magnificent vista, as A TEACHING
text: ASSISTANT hands him some papers to look through.
scene_heading: TEACHING ASSISTANT
dialog: Looking forward to getting back to
dialog: Tianjin, Professor?
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: I do love these two weeks in the
dialog: quarry, but a new semester means
dialog: fresh minds to open to all the
dialog: amazing realities of our world.
scene_heading: TEACHING ASSISTANT
dialog: You mean ‘possibilities’, right?
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: 65 million years ago, this whole
dialog: region was underwater. And those
dialog: fossils out there were alive.
dialog: Sure, the water has receded. But
dialog: what makes you think the ocean
dialog: itself has changed?
text: The conversation trails off because of the sound of an
text: arriving helicopter.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: We expecting guests?
dialog: 23.
text: The TA shakes his head. He goes to check a clip-board.
text: Jonas sees Mac, Heller, and Zhang get out.
scene_heading: TEACHING ASSISTANT
dialog: There’s nothing on the schedule...

scene_heading: EXT. EXCAVATION SITE - CONTINUED
text: Jonas gives Mac a big hug.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: How are you, Captain?
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Better than you, Mac, judging by
dialog: the looks of you.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Captain Taylor, I’m--
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: I know who you are Dr. Zhang. It’s
dialog: an honor and a privilege.
text: Last, but not least, is a rather sheepish Heller.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: Hello, Jonas.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Hey there, Tom.
text: POW - Jonas punches Heller in the face. Heller goes down.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: That actually went better than I
dialog: expected.
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER - A LITTLE LATER
text: Jonas looks through screen grabs taken from the video feeds
text: off of Junjie’s sub and the UNIS BOTs.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: How long after the BOTs were
dialog: activated did you lose them?
speaker_heading: MAC
text: Maybe five minutes.
dialog: Mac shows
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: And where were you, exactly?
text: him on the chart. Jonas gives Mac a look.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: You went back there?
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: It was my decision. That part of
dialog: the trench has never been explored,
dialog: its combination of depth and
dialog: expanse make it--
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: The last great unknown on Earth.
dialog: Yeah, I’ve heard that before. It’s
dialog: why the Navy had the Chesapeake
dialog: doing maneuvers down there. It’s
dialog: why they had to send me in to
dialog: rescue her men when she was
dialog: mysteriously disabled. And it’s
dialog: why this guy blamed me when
dialog: everyone died!
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: I didn’t blame you. I simply said
dialog: that your after-action report,
dialog: claiming you had been attacked by
dialog: something down there, was likely
dialog: the result of hypoxic dementia--
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: After which I was court-martialed,
text: black-balled from every diving
dialog: operation in the world, and now
dialog: receive a steady supply of hate
dialog: mail from widows who think I’m the
dialog: reason those men are gone.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Look, Jonas. I’m not a past or
dialog: future guy. I’m present tense.
dialog: I've got two crew members sitting
dialog: down there--
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: And who are you going to send for
text: their rescuers when they get taken
dialog: out too?
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Captain, I’ve read your account of
dialog: what happened to you. Before today,
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: ZHANG (CONT'D)
dialog: I wouldn't have given credence to
dialog: your theories. But now... Now, two
dialog: of my friends are dead. And my
text: daughter is only alive by providence.
dialog: I’m here, we're here, because you
dialog: give us the best chance of not adding
dialog: any more friends to that list.
text: Jonas looks out at the field of fossils. We don’t see what
text: he’s looking at, but we know he’s made up his mind.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: Think of it as a chance to prove me
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (looks at Heller a beat)
dialog: Don’t you get it? I don’t want you
dialog: to be wrong.
text: Jonas walks out. They realize he’s heading for the
dialog: helicopter. That’s good news.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
text: All four of them are seated, the machine is about to lift
text: off. Heller stares at a SCREEN CAPTURE PHOTO in Mac’s hands.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: You really think there’s something
dialog: down there that could do that?
text: Meaning, the BOT - torn in half. Mac looks OUT THE WINDOW.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: As a matter of fact, I do...
text: Heller turns, and as the chopper lifts off, we REVEAL THE DIG
text: SITE IN FULL... And there, in the ochre canyon walls, is a
text: SET OF JAWS SO BIG that eight grad students - standing side
text: by side - fit comfortably in its width. We HOLD on it and--
speaker_heading: WIPE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANA ONE - NIGHT
text: The helicopter has landed. Mac and Jonas have split off from
text: the other two. They walk across the platform with purpose,
text: Jonas’s attention drawn to the state-of-the-art subs. He
text: eyeballs them, impressed. Very impressed.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: We dive in one hour.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Why wait that long?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: For starters, your two dive mates
dialog: are in decomp...
text: MAC INDICATES THE DECOMPRESSION TANK IN THE DISTANCE where

speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: That's comforting.

scene_heading: EXT. MANA ONE - CONTINUED
text: Meiying watches from a distance as Mac and Jonas inspect

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Jonas Taylor - Dimitri Karmanov -
dialog: Linfan Chang.
dialog: (asks Dimitri)
dialog: So, what’s the verdict?
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (furrowed brow)
dialog: Suyin took a direct hit froma
text: large piece of debris. The
dialog: pressure lines were cut. There was
text: damage to the sensor array. The
dialog: entire Nav was smashed--
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: --Stop. Are you doing that thing
dialog: where you tell me how bad it is,
dialog: then tell me you managed to fix it,
dialog: so you look like a hero?
text: That hangs there a beat.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: No. I’m telling you it’s fixed.
dialog: (beat, deadpan)

text: Meiying follows Jonas and Mac as they run into:
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Captain Taylor, I’m Presca Morris,
dialog: one of the financial partners in
dialog: Mana-One. I was looking up your
dialog: records, and, well, all I found
dialog: were records. Most dives below
dialog: 20,0000 feet, most rescues in the
dialog: history of the Navy, the list went
dialog: on and on... Needless to say, I’m
dialog: very glad you're with us.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Thank you, ma’am.

speaker_heading: MAC

speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: The crazy one.
text: Jonas looks at Mac.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Well, I see my reputation precedes

dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: My mom, when grandpa told her you

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: .-.I’m out of here...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Yeah, I bet you are...
text: Mac EXITS, leaving Jonas and Meiying alone. Jonas gets a
text: kick out of the little girl’s moxie.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: I’m not crazy. It’s just -- I’ve
dialog: seen things no one else has.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: That’s the definition of crazy.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: You’re tough.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: Titanium.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Titanium? Wow, I’ve never met a

dialog: a few made of ice but...
text: Jonas goes to squeeze Meiying’s biceps, which she’s offering
dialog: as proof of her strength.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Those are some guns you’ve got--
speaker_heading: SUYIN (ARRIVING)
dialog: (in Mandarin)
dialog: Meiying come here now.
text: Meiying retreats to her mom’s side. Suyin, liberated from

speaker_heading: JONAS

speaker_heading: SUYIN

speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: From what Francois described, best
dialog: guess is he’s along this ridge

dialog: Off their looks.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Send me, alone, in the Mule. Let

speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: If the hatch is blocked, then the
dialog: two of you can come down to tow...
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Okay, first of all, your method
dialog: will waste hours...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: But put less lives at risk...
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Second, I notice you picked

speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: .-.-In spite of the time off, yes. I

speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: ...I was going to say, in spite of
dialog: the fact that on your last rescue
dialog: everyone else was killed.
text: That hangs there a beat.
dialog: Landslide.
speaker_heading: JONAS

dialog: made it if they believed what I was
dialog: telling them...
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: ...Are we sure we want him with
dialog: us...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: ..-But, no, they were convinced it
dialog: had to be a landslide.
text: The word hangs there. Suddenly, all is quiet.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: I don’t blame them. I thought that
dialog: at first too. I mean, what else
dialog: could show up on the sonar like
dialog: that? What else could tear open
dialog: metal like it was tin? You don’t
dialog: think about the fact that this
dialog: ‘landslide’ isn’t triggering any
dialog: readings on the seismograph. You
dialog: don’t say to yourself - this is the
dialog: most accurate, lethal, guided
dialog: landslide in the 4 billion year
dialog: history of geology. Because what
dialog: else could it be, right?
text: After a long silence.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Let me go, alone--
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: No one appreciates your expertise

scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK 2 - DJ

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL 3 - JONAS
text: Unlike DJ and Suyin, it’s taking Jonas a few moments to get

speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Mana, I’m showing a fault in the

speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)

speaker_heading: FAN (MIC)

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS
text: Jonas exhales, we can see frost on his breath. Re-cycle the

speaker_heading: DJ (RADIO)

speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: DJ, I’m not in the mood--
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ

speaker_heading: DJ

speaker_heading: FAN

dialog: found some kind of warm water
text: upcurrent through the thermocline.
dialog: (looks at Zhang)
dialog: Have you ever heard of that?
speaker_heading: ZHANG
text: No. The thermocline is a wall.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Yeah well, there’s a hole in this
dialog: wall, and if you don’t mind, I'd
dialog: like to send our team through it so
text: Jonas doesn’t freeze to death.
speaker_heading: FAN (MIC)

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS
text: Jonas tosses the checklist aside.
speaker_heading: FAN (RADIO)

scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN

speaker_heading: SUYIN

speaker_heading: DJ (RADIO)

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS

speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: I’ve found the channel. I’m going

scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN

speaker_heading: SUYIN

speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: Affirmative.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: You feel like telling us why?
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: See for yourself.
text: Suyin, annoyed, decides to go ahead. She kills her lights,

text: HER FASTBACK is suddenly illuminated by COLORFUL
text: BIOLUMINESCENT LIGHTS from outside. It’s dazzling.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
text: DJ, in near total darkness, is already enjoying the show.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Ok, I’m not gonna lie. This is
dialog: awesome.
text: The warm water channel is filled with tiny plankton and algae
text: that LIGHT UP when agitated, meaning DJ is leaving a trail of

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS

speaker_heading: JONAS

speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
dialog: Negative, Angel Three. This is a

speaker_heading: JONAS

speaker_heading: FRANCOIS (RADIO)

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL TWO - CONTINUED

speaker_heading: FRANCOIS (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL TWO - CONTINUED

speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Guys... Did you see that?
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS

speaker_heading: JONAS

scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
text: DJ checks his sonar. It’s PINGING. His HEADS-UP display has

speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: I've got it too, multiple bogeys...
speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
dialog: Then let’s hurry this up.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
text: Suyin takes her sub down a little faster and THROWS ON HER
text: FLOOD LIGHTS illuminating the dark...
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: Fastback, that is a bad idea--
text: Suyin reaches the bottom. Her engines KICK UP THE SAND --
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Dammit...
dialog: -- creating an undersea FOG that, because of the lack of
text: current, just hangs there, obscuring everything.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: I've lost all visibility. Repeat,
dialog: lost all visibility...
text: She gets occasional glimpses of clear water in between thick
text: patches of cloudy sand. SOMETHING passes by in the darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: There’s something down here.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
text: DJ gets a glimpse of SOMETHING too.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: I see it!
text: But it is gone as quickly as it was there.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Why aren't we getting it on sonar?!
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: The sand fog’s made the sonar
dialog: useless...
scene_heading: INT. DCC - CONTINUED
text: As all three pilots are now talking over one another.
speaker_heading: DJ (RADIO)
dialog: Mana-One, we are NOT alone down

speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: You both need to pull back...
speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
dialog: Negative, I’m attaching my tow-line
dialog: to Angel Two. DJ, standby...
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
text: Suyin centers ANGEL TWO in her sights and FIRES her tow-line.
text: Whooosh - a thin, magnetic-tipped length of wire shoots off
text: into the darkness towards ANGEL TWO but... THUNK... IT HITS
text: SOMETHING ELSE FIRST and falls to the sea floor.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: What the...?
text: --WHAM!! SOMETHING MASSIVE hits Fastback One. It’s a

scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ

speaker_heading: DJ

speaker_heading: DI

speaker_heading: SUYIN

text: JONAS'S PULSE is steady. And that’s because...
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - CONTINUED
text: Jonas makes a choice. He slams the throttle forward.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Angel Two, forget about the tow.
dialog: Prepare for hatch-to-hatch!
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
text: Angel Three plunges fearlessly through the zero visibility.
scene_heading: EXT. ANGEL THREE - ANGEL TWO
text: Jonas deftly rolls his sub on its side, aligning its hatch
text: with Angel Two’s hatch.
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: Standby for docking!
text: The two hatches meet with a THUD that reverberates into the
text: darkness at the speed of sound. It travels out past the
text: fastback subs, into the black, where SOMETHING REACTS to it.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
text: Ping. Suyin looks down. A clear target on passive sonar.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (MIC)
dialog: Angel Three. Single target. 2000

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - CONTINUED

speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
dialog: Angel Three, 1200 yards... A
dialog: thousand...!
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL TWO / ANGEL THREE
text: Francois unseals his upper hatch and opens it. After some
text: residual water falls out, he is safe to climb through to the
dialog: hatch of the Angel Three.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
dialog: Coming up on 800 yards, you need to
dialog: get out of there!
text: As Luc preps the ship for evac, HE SUDDENLY SEES SOMETHING
text: out the sub window that stops him in his tracks...
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Come on, Luc! Come on!
dialog: «+..a vague bioluminescent trail behind some otherwise
text: invisible beast that’s coming right at them.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
dialog: 600 yards... 400 yards!
text: Luc knows there’s no time. He closes his hatch and--
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: No!
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL TWO - NOW SEPARATE
text: Luc BLOWS the lock, detaching violently from Angel Three.
dialog: And not a moment too soon. Because...
text: ..-BAM! Angel Two is smashed into oblivion by something 70-
text: feet long and moving at more than 50 miles per hour.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
text: Suyin feels the vibrations of the terrible collision.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Angel Three, come in?! Angel
dialog: Three...
text: As she waits for a reply, PING... PING... Suyin’s sonar tells
text: her the mysterious monster is now coming for her and DJ.
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
text: Sparks explode inside the main cabin as Jonas and Francois
text: recover from the partial impact. The only light comes
text: intermittently from the flashing red alarms blaring.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: This is Angel Three, we lost Luc.
dialog: You both need to power down now!
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
text: PING... PING.... DJ realizes they don’t have much time.
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: It’s drawn to energy. You need to
dialog: go dark!
speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
dialog: --But we’ll be sitting ducks!--
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: That’s better than dead ducks!
text: DJ's turns off EVERYTHING that sends out a signal, including
text: lights. That leaves only the PINGING of his passive sonar,
text: which gets faster as whatever is out there closes in.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
text: Suyin now sits in the dark too. As the PINGING becomes
text: frantic, she stares out into the inky sea and takes her hands
text: away from the controls. She braces for impact as SWOOOOOSH!!
text: SOMETHING MASSIVE HURTLES JUST PAST HER...
dialog: 43.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
text: DJ feels it go by too... Then, he exhales. He’s alive. For
text: now. But the PINGING of his sonar now reveals that:
speaker_heading: DJ
text: It’s circling us.
scene_heading: INT. DCC - CONTINUED
text: Mac and his team, desperate to help.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI (MIC)
dialog: Use your infrared, you should be
text: able to see and not be seen.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
text: Suyin turns on the sub’s infrared lights and pulls down a
dialog: visor...
text: HER POV -- It’s similar to night vision, a world in black and
text: green. Suyin can see the distant outline of the trench wall,
text: she can see DJ’s sub, and she can see A BLUR OF MOVEMENT
text: which leaves in its wake a random trail of bioluminescence.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: I don’t think seeing is going to
dialog: help much. Any other ideas, Mana?
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
text: DJ, scared, has also gone to infrared. The first thing he
text: sees is the SHAPE of Suyin’s Abyss Glider. So fish-like.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Here’s an idea. Dimitri, the next
dialog: time you design a sub, maybe don’t
dialog: make it look like the catch of the
dialog: day!
text: Then DJ freezes...
text: HIS INFRARED POV -- A GIANT SQUID, with a body twenty feet
text: long and tentacles measuring out to more than a hundred, is
text: now floating right in between him and Suyin.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Suyin...
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
text: Suyin turns and sees the monster. They seem totally helpless

scene_heading: --UNTIL -- WHAM -- THE GIANT SQUID IS TORN IN HALF in one

scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN

speaker_heading: SUYIN

scene_heading: INT. DCC - CONTINUED

speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
text: It ripped a giant squid right in
dialog: half.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
text: DJ was even closer to the mauling. He’s actually drifting
text: through what’s left of the squid.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Yeah. And I say we get out of here
dialog: before it get gets hungry again!
dialog: DJ starts to power up when--
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: No, DJ. Don’t. If you power on,
dialog: it will come for you. You have to
dialog: surface without using your engines.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
text: Suyin shakes her head to no one.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: We're too deep, Jonas. We need our
dialog: engines to climb from down here.
dialog: We’re at zero ballast.
text: As if to emphasize the danger, SOMETHING speeds by in the
text: darkness, ROCKING THE TWO FASTBACKS IN ITS WAKE.
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
text: Jonas looks at Francois - is she right? Francois nods, yes.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Mules have standard ballast tanks,
dialog: but not the fastbacks. This deep,
dialog: they have to power up--
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: If they power up - they’re fish
dialog: food!
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: They're already fish food! We need
dialog: to get them off the menu!
text: Jonas gets an IDEA. He keys the mic.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: What about the thermal vent?
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
text: Suyin understands the plan the minute she hears it...
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: That upcurrent of warm water we
dialog: rode down. That could carry you up
dialog: a few thousand meters without you
dialog: needing power.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
dialog: DJ wants to be hopeful but...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: I don’t mean to be a downer but
dialog: that vent is a mile from here and I

dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
text: Jonas is one step ahead of them. He turns to Francois.
speaker_heading: JONAS

scene_heading: INT. DCC - CONTINUED
text: Everyone, desperate for ideas, when they hear Jonas’ plan:
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)

dialog: you to, I want you to both power up
dialog: and go flank speed for the vents.
text: Looks are exchanged. What’s Jonas doing?
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)

speaker_heading: SUYIN

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS

speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: (to Jonas, droll)

speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Now!
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - SUYIN
text: Suyin can suddenly see a bloom of white as -- FWOOMP! -- The
text: BRIGHT LIGHTS of Angel Three shatter the darkness like an
text: undersea North Star. Suyin is jostled by the WAKE of
text: SOMETHING MASSIVE OVERHEAD. It completely eclipses the Angel
text: Three, taking seconds, that feel like minutes, to pass, until
text: even in the darkness, she makes out the unmistakable shape of
text: an ENORMOUS TAIL FIN snapping right in front of her.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Oh my God.

speaker_heading: SUYIN

scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK TWO - DJ
text: DJ sees it too. Then suddenly a TENTACLE ATTACKS HIS SUB...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: AHHH...
text: For a moment, DJ thinks he’s squid food. He is ensnared in

speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)

speaker_heading: DJ

scene_heading: EXT. ANGEL THREE - CONTINUED
text: The suddenly rising sub drops a FLARE, which spreads like a
text: comet tail behind them. As it does, Jonas kills the sub
text: lights, so all focus is on the brilliant burning star.
text: It drops through the inky depths. Illuminating a wall filled
text: with brightly colored algae, coral, alien creatures, until...
text: WHOOSH, the massive beast snatches the flare, its enormous
text: jaws illuminated for the first time. The creature swims
text: through its target, colliding violently with the undersea

speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: Mana, this is Angel Three. We’ve
dialog: blown our ballast and are rising,
dialog: power off. We’ve lost our
dialog: directional control so someone’s
dialog: going to have to come meet us.

speaker_heading: MAC (MIC)

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - JONAS AND FRANCOIS
text: The PINGS are here too. The MEG is coming for them.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: But all the power’s off...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: I guess she learned that trick.
text: Jonas begins to power the sub back on.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: We have to make flank speed for the
dialog: thermocline. It can’t follow us
dialog: through that! Francois, you ever
dialog: been shot out of a cannon?
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Right now, that actually sounds
dialog: like a pretty good idea.

scene_heading: INT. DCC - CONTINUED

speaker_heading: MAC

speaker_heading: FRANCOIS

scene_heading: INT. DCC - CONTINUED

scene_heading: INT. ANGEL THREE - CONTINUED
dialog: The bad news is the beast has nearly reached them. And, to

speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: We're losing the engines!
scene_heading: EXT. ANGEL THREE

speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Nice to meet you by the way.
scene_heading: EXT. FASTBACKS ONE AND TWO - CONTINUED
text: The Abyss Gliders head for the surface. As they speed off,
text: we notice THE BLOODY TRAIL OF SQUID DJ’s sub is leaving
text: behind... A trail that goes down... And down... And
dialog: eventually...
text: Into that warm water channel through the thermocline.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - DAY
text: ANGEL THREE bursts through the surface. Jonas pops the
text: hatch, climbs up and sees... NOTHING BUT OCEAN.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: So much for a welcoming committee.
text: BLARE! Comes the sound of a SHIP’S HORN as Jonas and
text: Francois turn around to see ZHANG’S RESEARCH VESSEL - THE
text: MAZU -- a thousand yards away. And closing.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Now that’s more like it.
text: The SHIP’S HORN sounds again as we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A PRIVATE BAY - HAINAN ISLAND - THAT AFTERNOON
text: Peace and quiet in one of Hainan’s most tranquil bays.
text: The MAZU is anchored a few hundred yards off shore from THE
scene_heading: NEW 5-STAR “MANA RESORT AND SPA”. The place is a few months
text: from opening, but Morris’s crown jewel is fully built, with a
text: skeleton staff is putting it through its paces.
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH BUNGALOW GUEST ROOM - SHOWER - DAY
text: Jonas enjoys a hot shower. He’s cleaning up, and he’s trying
text: to psychologically decompress from what’s just happened. He
text: TURNS OFF the water and just stands there, breathing.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. BEACH BUNGALOW - CONTINUED
text: A knock and Jonas's unlocked door swings open. SUYIN and
text: MEIYING are there. Meiying holding something in her hands.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Jonas? Jonas?
text: JONAS - having not heard them - steps out from his bathroom.
text: Luckily, he’s in a towel.
speaker_heading: SUYIN AND JONAS
dialog: Oh, excuse me... Sorry, I didn’t
dialog: know...
text: Meiying BURSTS OUT laughing. And, as Jonas retreats to
text: quickly pull on some clothes out of their line of sight, he
text: begins to LAUGH too - because Meiying’s glee is infectious.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (calls)
dialog: She kills me, you know that?
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: (calls back)
dialog: Tell me about it. Saying no to her
dialog: is almost impossible.
text: Jonas returns, dressed and smiling. Is this the first time
dialog: Suyin has allowed herself to realize he’s handsome? She's
text: suddenly very aware. Luckily, her daughter to the rescue.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: This is for you...
text: Meiying hands him the somewhat crudely wrapped blob. It’s a
text: DOLPHIN CHARM made of...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Titanium.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: The dolphin is the symbol of the
dialog: Zhang family. They’re also known
dialog: to save people... from sharks.
text: Meiying reveals that she wears a matching, smaller, version
text: of the charm around her neck. Jonas is very touched.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: No, thank you.
text: Meiying begins to tug on her mom, wants her to ask Jonas
text: something, but Suyin has her own thought to finish first.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: I was hard on you. I didn’t treat
dialog: you with the respect you deserved--
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Forget about it--
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: You_saved our lives.
text: Her sincerity makes him uncomfortable. The intimacy of it.
dialog: He shrugs it off but--
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Jonas. Thank you.
text: He nods. You’re welcome. Now, Meiying’s tugging reaches a
dialog: fever pitch.
speaker_heading: JONAS
text: Whatever it is, she’s not giving up.
text: Suyin stops her daughter with a look. Then...
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Meiying wants me to ask you to join
dialog: us for tea. It’s another family
dialog: tradition. We share tea every time
dialog: I’m back from a dive.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: Only she missed it last time
dialog: because she was in that stupid
text: Decompression Tank.
text: Jonas laughs at Meiying yet again. But then he sees
text: something through the doorway behind them. It’s MAC and
text: ZHANG walking a main building of the resort.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: I'd like to, but actually I have to
dialog: talk to Mac about getting back to
dialog: the mainland.
text: Those words sting Suyin in a way she hadn’t expected.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: You're leaving? Right. Of course.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Now that everyone’s safe... I
dialog: expect your father has a full plate
dialog: without me to worry about.
text: Suyin hides her disappointment. Meiying doesn’t.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - RESORT - DAY
text: A room with a view of the Pacific. Right now it hosts an
text: INTENSE DISCUSSION between Zhang, Morris, Heller, and Mac.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: .-.I’m not saying what happened
dialog: wasn’t a tragedy, I just want to
dialog: set that aside long enough to talk
dialog: about what we found down there and
dialog: what it means for the future.
dialog: Because the choices we make between
dialog: now and when you announce what
dialog: happened could mean billions of
dialog: dollars of added value.
text: REVEAL - JONAS, outside, listening and thinking that--
scene_heading: EXT/INT. THE RESORT’S OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Jonas finds Suyin and Meiying have set up tea at a table
text: along the water’s edge.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: --On second thought, tea sounds
dialog: great.
text: Meiying claps.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: Okay, sit here... And do exactly
dialog: as I say...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (laughing, to Suyin)
text: Apple doesn’t fall from the tree.
text: Suyin blushes.

text: A PICTORIAL of the ocean is unfurled. It depicts the sea
text: seen from the side, so is all about the VARIOUS DEPTHS.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: In general, the deeper you go, the
dialog: further you get from the sun, the
dialog: colder the ocean gets.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: But where we dove today, at the
dialog: very bottom, that water was warm.
text: Zhang indicates ‘Siren’s Void’ - the vast basin of the
text: Marianas Trench - an area more than 1,000 miles long.
speaker_heading: The CHART
dialog: bottom...
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Yes, a portion of the deepest ocean
text: is heated by volcanic vents. In
dialog: these areas, as you get away from
dialog: the heat source, so in this case as
dialog: you rise, the water gets colder.
text: makes it clear. The water goes from warm at the
text: gets cold as it rises away from the heat source...
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: The coldest water is always here in
dialog: the thermocline. This water is too
dialog: cold to support any life.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: So whatever lives above, stays
dialog: above. And whatever lives below,
dialog: stays below.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Given that we’ve never explored
dialog: Siren’s Void, and given we've
dialog: encountered at least one species,
dialog: the Megaladon, heretofore thought
dialog: extinct, I think the odds are there
dialog: is an entire ecosystem down there
dialog: that has remained untouched for
dialog: millions of years.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: Meaning we’re sitting on top of our
dialog: very own Jurassic sea!
scene_heading: INTERCUT -- THE RESORT’S OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT - SUNSET
text: Meiying is showing Jonas the proper way to hold his tea cup,
text: and Jonas is purposely getting it wrong to make her laugh.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: He’s funny!
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Yeah. Funny looking.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Do you have children, Jonas?
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: No. When I was in the Navy, my
dialog: wife and I kept putting it off...
dialog: Then after we got divorced, I
dialog: focused all my energy on...
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Proving you weren’t crazy.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: See, I told you she said you were
dialog: crazy!
dialog: That gets more laughs. But then, as kids often do, Meiying
text: suddenly realizes something and gets sad.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: Wait. Does that mean you don’t
dialog: have a family?
text: Jonas shakes his head, he doesn’t.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Got room for us?
text: FAN arrives, with DIMITRI and DJ. FRANCOIS is close behind.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: The more the merrier. Dimitri,
dialog: since when do you drink tea?
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (nods to Fan)
dialog: Since she makes me.
text: That gets a good LAUGH. Dimitri frowns.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: I wasn’t joking.
text: That gets a BIGGER LAUGH.
scene_heading: BACK TO -- INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - RESORT - SUNSET
text: Where Morris is acting like they’ve just struck gold.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Why am I the only one excited here?
dialog: I’m no Marine Biologist, but even I
dialog: remember the prehistoric oceans
dialog: were filled will all sorts of
dialog: amazing creatures.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Including one that just killed
dialog: three of our people.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Again, I’m not discounting that...
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: That's exactly what you’re doing...
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Speculation is dangerous, Ms.
dialog: Morris. Only one thing is clear:
dialog: we've found something very special,
dialog: so we must proceed with caution.
dialog: I'm afraid our plans to
dialog: commercialize the Mana-One must be
text: put on indefinite hold.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: You can’t be serious...
speaker_heading: ZHANG
text: The platform is located directly
dialog: above this new world...
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Which means we should double its
dialog: size. Then build a second one--
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: This isn’t about attracting
dialog: visitors. It’s about making sure
dialog: we protect the ecosystem.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: If those things have been down
dialog: there for 200 million years, I
dialog: think their ecosystem can handle it-
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: I’m talking about our Ecosystem.
dialog: (it hangs there a beat)
dialog: The world we live in, a world whose
dialog: entire balance of life would shift
dialog: violently if even one pre-historic
dialog: creature found its way up here.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: INTERCUT -- THE RESORT’S OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT - SUNSET
text: Where everyone is laughing now - relieved - letting go of
text: some of the tension. DJ raises his tea.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: I'd like to propose a toast. To
dialog: Jonas.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: To Jonas.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Wait...
dialog: (raises his)
text: To Junjie, Carl, and Luc.
dialog: If Jonas wasn’t a full-member of the team, then that gesture
text: puts him over the top. It’s met with nods and teary eyes.
text: They drink, and then after they put their cups down all eyes
dialog: turn to Francois.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: So, Francois. You got anything
dialog: stronger than tea in your bungalow?
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Why is it the Frenchman who always
dialog: has to have the wine?
dialog: (beat, a grin)
dialog: I‘1l be right back...
text: Suyin and Jonas exchange a smile. A smile that lingers. A
text: smile that keeps them focusing on each other even as we BEGIN
text: TO HEAR the sound of a skiff’s engine racing into the bay.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: There’s something out there...
scene_heading: BACK TO -- INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - RESORT - SUNSET
text: Morris looks at Zhang and the rest.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Dr. Zhang, you are a brilliant man.
dialog: But if you think you can control
dialog: what’s about to happen, you are,
dialog: forgive me, very naive. Before
dialog: today, your platform was a
dialog: specialty attraction. But when the
dialog: world hears what you found, it is
dialog: going to be the most desired
dialog: destination on Earth. Every child
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: MORRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: on the planet will want to come
dialog: here. Every parent will make it a
dialog: priority. This resort, and every
dialog: resort within 500 miles will devote
dialog: themselves to what’s down there.
dialog: Whether we like that or not--
text: Morris stops as suddenly the door is thrown open. SUYIN,
text: breathless from running, is there.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Dr. Heller!
scene_heading: INT. RESORT’S BEACH - SUNSET/NIGHT
text: Suyin and Heller race down to the water's edge - (Mac, Zhang,
text: and Morris close behind). They find the rest of the team has
text: encircled a fishing boat’s skiff, whose PILOT has driven it
text: right up on the sand. Then they see why:
text: A SECOND MAN - lying unconscious and bleeding on the sand.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: (quickly goes to work)
text: He’s in shock and suffering from
dialog: severe hypothermia. We need to get
text: him to a hospital, right away--.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: We called for an ambulance.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: Good, in the meantime, you can help
dialog: me make sure he doesn’t lose any
dialog: more blood.
text: As Fan joins Heller in bandaging the seemingly endless number
text: cuts on the man’s body, Mac asks the big question.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What happened?
text: The Skiff’s Pilot answers in Mandarin.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (TRANSLATING)
dialog: His ship was fishing when they
text: heard a crash. They turned and saw
text: their sister ship had been smashed.
text: Not an explosion, just smashed. By
dialog: the time they got over to the
dialog: wreckage, this man was the only one
text: in the water. The others had
dialog: vanished.
dialog: 61.
text: The AMBULANCE has arrived. PARAMEDICS come racing over with
text: a stretcher. Heller supervises as they take the patient to
dialog: the ambulance...
speaker_heading: SKIFF’S PILOT
dialog: (in broken English)
dialog: Sea Monster. He said - a Sea
text: Monster attacked his ship.
text: As THE ENTIRE TEAM exchanges glances we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A PRIVATE BAY - HAINAN ISLAND - NIGHT
text: The Mazu’s anchor clears the surface, and the boat pivots
text: until it is pointed out sea. Then its mighty engines roar to
text: life - and the Mazu heads out into the darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
text: Even with DJ and Suyin’s Abyss Gliders in tow, the Mazu can
text: go as fast as 30 knots, its bow piercing the dark waters...
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU - NIGHT
text: Jonas is up near the bow rail, looking out into night,
text: wondering... Shaking his head as Mac looks on.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: If that thing followed us... If
dialog: it’s up here somehow...
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: If being the key word.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: He called it a sea monster, Mac.
dialog: All his life he’s worked the ocean,
dialog: and he called it a sea monster...
text: As if on cue the Mazu’s engines grow quiet and the ship
dialog: 
text: DECELERATES... Now we see why Because they are drifting
text: through floating wooden debris... A whole field of it.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (droll)
dialog: You think a great white did this?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I think we're about to find out.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: How?
dialog: 62.
text: Off Mac’s look...
text: A SERIES OF QUICK INTERCUT SHOTS:
scene_heading: INT. DIVE PREP ROOM - THE MAZU
text: Close on FAN pulling on a wet suit. DIMITRI zips her up.
scene_heading: INT. THE BRIDGE - THE MAZU
text: Jonas looking at Zhang and Morris. He’s backed by DJ and
text: Francois. Suyin somewhere in the middle.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Tell me this is a joke...
scene_heading: INT. DIVE PREP ROOM - THE MAZU
text: FAN, now fully suited up, CHECKS THE ACTION on a CARBON FIBER
text: SPEAR GUN that is as light-weight as it is bad-ass looking.
scene_heading: INT. THE BRIDGE - THE MAZU
text: Jonas, continuing his rant.
speaker_heading: JONAS (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Tell me we're not seriously
dialog: considering doing this...
scene_heading: EXT. DIVE PREP ROOM - THE MAZU
text: DIMITRI is filling SPEAR-TIPS (rounds for the Spear Gun) with
text: liquid etorphine from glass medical bottles.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
text: An elephant is knocked out with 10
dialog: cc’s - so 100?
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: (not messing around)
dialog: Use the whole damn bottle.
scene_heading: INT. THE BRIDGE - THE MAZU
text: Jonas shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JONAS (CONT'D)
dialog: -..-Because unless I missed
dialog: something, this is insane.
text: All eyes turn to Zhang. Zhang looks at Fan and Dimitri.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: (disagrees forcefully)
dialog: If the Meg followed DJ's trail up
dialog: through the thermocline, then we
dialog: can’t let it get away. We know it
dialog: likes electromagnetic energy - that
dialog: means Dimitri’s cage will draw it
dialog: in like a moth to flame...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: .+-Did you just compare that thing
dialog: to a moth? This is madness...
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: .--Actually madness, if I
dialog: understand Dr. Zhang correctly,
dialog: would be to let this creature roam
text: off towards the fishing fleet.
dialog: Those boats wouldn’t stand a
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (glares at Morris)
dialog: A captured Meg would make for great
dialog: advertising, is that it?
dialog: Zhang has heard enough.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: We can’t avoid the truth, no matter
dialog: how unpleasant. If there is a
dialog: Megaladon here, if we leave it free
dialog: to feed and mate, then we would be
dialog: responsible for the worst
dialog: ecological disaster in history.
dialog: We, who have given our lives to
dialog: protect these oceans.
dialog: (he looks at Dimitri)
dialog: Are you sure your cage will hold?
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Math never lies. The Megaladon
dialog: could be the size of this ship, the
dialog: cage will not break.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: I‘1l bet my life on it.
text: She takes Dimitri’s hand. Squeezes it.
dialog: 64.
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU - AFT-DECK
text: There are TWO KEY FEATURES to the back of the MAZU: One is a
text: small HELIPAD. The other is a PAIR OF MASSIVE RIGGING
dialog: CRANES. And it is from one of those crane’s that--
scene_heading: --DIMITRI’S DIVE CYLINDER is now suspended.
text: The DIVE CYLINDER is a wonder. A ten foot-tall tube, made of
text: SELEXIS, a clear material, plastic in appearance, that is THE
scene_heading: STRONGEST MAN-MADE MATERIAL in HISTORY.
text: The CYLINDER has no corners, no weak points, and is large
text: enough to hold several divers, though only FAN will be going
text: down in it this time.
text: OPENINGS cut in the center and the top of the structure are
text: too small for a shark to get through, but large enough for
text: FAN to use as murder holes for her SPEAR GUN.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CYLINDER - CONTINUED
text: Mac operates the crane, lowers the DIVE CYLINDER into the
text: water, stopping when it is half submerged to allow FAN, fully-
text: suited up, to climb inside.
text: Dimitri leans over the top, hands Fan her spear gun. Fan
text: cocks it with confidence. Dimitri stares at her.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Is it weird that I’m a little
dialog: turned on?
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: By the sight of your girlfriend
text: holding a high-velocity spear gun?
dialog: Yes, it’s a little weird.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You've never used the word
dialog: girlfriend before.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Please put me in the water.
text: Dimitri smiles, shuts the top, and nods to Mac...
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU - AFT-DECK - CONTINUED
text: Mac pulls a lever and the Dive Cylinder sinks into the sea.
text: Water floods the interior through the openings in the center
text: and top of the chamber. Among those watching the ‘launch’
text: is JONAS. He shakes his head, worried.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Jonas, I’m telling you. The cage
dialog: will not break.
text: We begin to hear the sound of an APPROACHING HELICOPTER.
dialog: Jonas turns to Suyin -- what gives?
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: I told father if we were going
dialog: shark hunting then he needed to
dialog: evacuate all non-essential
dialog: personnel to Hainan. Including...
text: Meiying, who is standing with Zhang, arms crossed. Visibly
text: upset at her mother.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CYLINDER - NOW UNDERWATER
text: The cylinder drops quickly. The invisible walls create an
text: astonishing visual, as if Fan is standing underwater. LIGHTS
text: snap ON and THE EXTERNAL CAMERAS position themselves.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
text: Just inside the aft deck, the ship’s dive room isn’t as fancy
text: as the one on the Mana One. THERE’S A BANK OF SMALL TV
scene_heading: MONITORS showing FAN and VARIOUS CAMERAS’ POVs. THERE’S A
text: SONAR SCREEN. CRANE/WINCH controls. And a MIC.
speaker_heading: MAC (MIC)
dialog: Radio check.
text: He looks at the MONITOR as FAN gives him a thumbs up.
speaker_heading: MAC (MIC)
dialog: Okay, taking you down to 100
dialog: meters.
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU - AFT-DECK - CONTINUED
text: The WHINE of the winch lowering the Dive Cylinder is no match
scene_heading: for the ROAR of the HELICOPTER ENGINE. Non-Essential
text: PERSONNEL are climbing aboard the chopper. Then only MEIYING
text: is left to get on-board.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: (over the noise)
dialog: I love you. I/’11 see you soon.
text: Meiying turns to the helicopter but then... RUNS AWAY!
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: MEIYING!
dialog: 66.
text: Meiying disappears into the ship. Suyin goes after her.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: (to Zhang)
dialog: Do you want them to wait?
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: (shakes his head no)
dialog: We’ll put her on the next one.
text: Morris NODS to the pilot. The HELICOPTER lifts off.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
text: The DIVE CYLINDER stops at 100M below the surface. The water
text: surrounding it now a deep rich black. Fan turns to a small
text: CONTROL BOX - we see a series of switches marked “ELECTRICAL
text: REPELLENT FIELD”. Click - click - click. She turns the
text: FIELD ON. For an INSTANT we see a tesla-coil like ELECTRICAL
text: CHARGE shoot through the CLEAR material.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
text: The entire team stand behind Mac, watching the monitors.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Okay, if that thing likes power,
dialog: she just became the equivalent of a
dialog: T-Bone steak.
text: Jonas shakes his head. That’s NOT a good thing.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
text: FAN'S POV - Nothing but deep, dark blue in every direction.
text: We HEAR her breathing, she’s trying to stay calm... But WHEN
text: ALL YOU SEE IS DARK BLUE, WHEN YOU ARE WAITING for SOMETHING
text: to appear, it is HARD TO STAY CALM.
dialog: Is that something...? No... What about that? No...
text: A 12-Foot GREAT WHITE passes over her head. She gasps!
scene_heading: INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
text: The Great White is visible on the monitors and the SONAR.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: Here comes a second one...
text: They can see the SHARKS on the sonar, sometimes before they
dialog: see them on the camera...
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: And a third...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: We've got ourselves a party.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
text: Drawn by the bait fish dangling off the rigging at the top of
text: the cylinder, the GREAT WHITES continue to increase in
text: number. FAN tries to keep them all in sight as...
scene_heading: NUDGE...ZAP!
text: The first of the sharks grabs for a meal and finds out that
text: the SELEXIS is ELECTRIFIED! The shark recoils as the
text: Cylinder rocks back and forth from the attempt.
text: A SECOND SHARK and then a THIRD try their luck, but they meet
text: the same painful fate. FAN’s cylinder is swaying back and
text: forth but she’s loving it, laughing, like she’s on an
dialog: amusement park ride.
text: Everywhere she looks she sees Great Whites, all of them
text: amazing. None of them what she’s hoping to see.
text: And then, as she does a complete 360 turn in the cylinder,
text: she begins to notice something:
text: The Great Whites are vanishing.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
text: Their retreat of is even more obvious on SONAR...
speaker_heading: MORRIS
text: They're getting frustrated.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: No. The only thing that can chase
dialog: off a shark is... a larger shark.
text: PING... PING... There, on the sonar, we now see a shape FOUR
text: TIMES LARGER than all the other shapes.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: It’s the Meg.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Get her out of there.
text: PING... PING... It’s like watching a train coming at someone.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (mic, calmly)
dialog: Fan, here we go. At your Six.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
text: Fan turns inside the cylinder to the direction Mac told her.
text: She holds the spear gun tightly. Eerie silence. Her
text: breathing the only sound besides Mac’s voice.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (radio, calm)
dialog: I’1l count it down for you...
text: FAN'S POV - as she prepares to see the monster...
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (radio, calm)
dialog: Five... Four...
scene_heading: FAN'S POV - Spear Gun ready...
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (radio, calm)
dialog: Three... Two...
scene_heading: FAN’S POV - Where is it!?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (radio, calm)
dialog: One... And...
text: FAN'S POV - She sees nothing. SUDDENLY, she looks down as
text: WHAM! The MEG, which had been swimming DEEPER than she
text: expected, SLAMS into the DIVE CYLINDER from below!
text: THE IMPACT IS MASSIVE. Sparks fly! FAN is tossed across the
text: cylinder, knocked senseless.
text: She recovers, tries to relocate the Meg. This time it comes
text: from directly in front. BAM! BAM! The Meg slides across the
text: cylinder, impervious to the electricity. Now we see it lit

text: SMASH! It knocks the cylinder completely HORIZONTAL!
scene_heading: INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
text: Watching the MONITORS is disorienting, because everything is
text: being knocked around. Mac and the others see GLIMPSES of
text: FAN... And then parts of the MEG...
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (loud)
dialog: Come on, this is crazy, get her out
dialog: of there!
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (louder)
dialog: The cage - will - not - break!
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
text: Fan steadies herself amidst the BASHING and the SWAYING. She
text: raises the SPEAR GUN and fires OFF THE PERFECT SHOT!
text: The DART reaches the dorsal fin, but BOUNCES OFF harmlessly!
text: The Meg’s skin just too tough to penetrate.
text: The MEG seems to take the shot personally because it comes at
text: Fan more aggressively than ever - HITTING THE CYLINDER AND
text: SCRAPING along it, creating a dazzling display of electric
text: fire, before disappearing into the void once again.
text: Fan has a moment to reload.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
text: They realize she fired...
speaker_heading: ZHANG (MIC)
dialog: Fan, did you hit it?
text: Fan raises her hand - fist closed.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Missed.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
text: Fan floats, waiting, searching the blue for what seems like
text: an eternity. Then the Meg pounces from the shadows...
scene_heading: BUT THIS TIME WITH ITS JAWS OPEN WIDE - SO WIDE THAT THEY
text: CHOMP DOWN ON THE CYLINDER - LIKE A DOG ON A CHEW TOY.
text: The MEG tugs and pulls the CYLINDER back and forth, as if
text: trying to free the ‘TOY’ from some imaginary ‘Master’s hand’
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! There go all but one of the cameras.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
text: GRRRRRRRIIIIIIINNNNNNDDDDDD.... What’s that sound? Jonas and
text: Dimitri race back outside.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU - AFT-DECK - CONTINUED
text: What they see BOGGLES their minds. That GRRIIINNNDDD is the
text: sound of the DIVE CABLE FORCIBLY UNSPOOLING from ITS MASSIVE
speaker_heading: REEL.
text: The Meg is pulling the Dive Cylinder Deeper a few feet at a
dialog: time. But that’s not the problem. The problem is...
text: CREAK. All that tension is putting a strain on the reel and
text: crane. Dimitri and Jonas both see it. Dimitri goes pale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: You're right - the cage won't
dialog: break... The crane will!
speaker_heading: ON JONAS
text: As he gets an idea and goes racing off, leaving Dimitri, who
text: is now panicking and running back inside...
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: We have to get her out of there!
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
text: The MASSIVE JAWS surround Fan, desperately trying to snap her
text: up. The Dive Cylinder DEFORMS under the pressure, but
text: doesn’t break, and it REBOUNDS to its normal shape any time
text: the MEG loosens its grip.
text: SLAM - SLAM - SLAM - SLAM - The Meg resumes yanking it back
text: and forth, dragging it further and further down.
text: Somehow FAN, who is being bounced around like a pinball,
text: notices that there is less SCALY ARMOR on the UNDERSIDE of
text: the Meg. She aims for what is an impossible shot...
text: Pfffft.... It’s a hit! Right between the pectoral fins! Fan
text: let’s out a celebratory yell that no one hears as the Meg
text: YANKS HER CYLINDER DOWN harder than ever!
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU - AFT-DECK - CONTINUED
text: Snap! Snap! The bolts at the base of the crane are
text: literally being pulled from the deck. And then, there is one
dialog: final SHARP SNAP...!
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CYLINDER - 100M BELOW THE SURFACE - NIGHT
text: ...A SNAP that coincides with the Meg’s SUDDEN RETREAT. For
text: a moment, Fan is about to celebrate. Then she looks up
text: towards the MOONLIT SURFACE above her...
dialog: 71.
text: At first she sees a SHADOW, then she is able to make out the
text: MASSIVE CRANE ARM hurtling towards her. The Meg has ripped
text: it off the deck. The ARM will drag her to the bottom of the
text: ocean, so she does the only thing she can, she opens the
text: ESCAPE HATCH ON TOP OF THE DIVE CYLINDER...
text: And she’s just clear of it when IT’S DRAGGED DOWN INTO THE
text: DARKNESS...
text: Fan finds herself floating, totally unprotected, 300 feet
text: below the surface. It doesn’t get much scarier than that.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
text: The one CAMERA still working on the cage shows a view of FAN
text: above... And FAN’S CAMERA shows just how exposed she is.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: She blew the hatch! She’s in the
dialog: water! She’s in the water!
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU - CONTINUED
text: RRRREEEVVVWV. That’s the sound of Dimitri firing up a ZODIAC
text: he’s launched off the far side of the ship.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Hang on...
text: Francois comes leaping into the Zodiac, manning the controls.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: I‘ll drive, you grab her.
text: He SHOVES the DUAL THROTTLES forward to the stops.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - 75 METERS DOWN
text: Fan kicking for the moonlit surface, still a long way to go.
text: Beneath her, in the dark, we see OCCASIONAL BURSTS OF
text: ELECTRICITY as the MEG continues to attack the Dive Cylinder.
text: There is a real rhythm to Meg’s strikes. We see LIGHT then
text: dark. LIGHT then dark. But then LIGHT stops...
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - 300 METERS DOWN
text: We see the Dive Cylinder now in free-fall. The MEG has
text: ABANDONED it. No longer interested in the ‘Toy’...
speaker_heading: MEG'S POV
text: There’s something tastier high up above.
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - FAN’S POV - 20 METERS DOWN
text: She's breathing heavy. The promise of the surface so close!
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - MEG’S POV
text: The moving figure of FAN is getting larger.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
text: Fan explodes onto the surface, spits out her regulator,
text: SCREAMS for help.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - MEG’S POV
dialog: All it sees is FAN now. This is going to be delicious...
text: .-.-Then SOMETHING comes plowing through FRAME from left to
dialog: right...
dialog: ...we KNOW it’s the ZODIAC. But all the MEG knows is once
text: this thing has passed... Fan has vanished.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - ON THE ZODIAC - NIGHT
text: Fan is coughing and breathless in Dimitri’s arms.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: I got the shot...
text: Francois, piloting them back to the Mazu at full throttle,
text: shakes his head in amazement. Dimitri looks into Fan’s eyes.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Of course you did. Because you are
dialog: the most bad-ass woman--
text: --Dimitri doesn’t get to finish that lovely thought because
text: suddenly ALL OF THEM ARE FLYING OUT OF CONTROL IN THE AIR...
text: .+..THROWN FAR FROM THE ZODIAC - WHICH IS ALSO HURTLING
text: THROUGH THE SKY - END OVER END.
scene_heading: EXT. AFT DECK - THE MAZU
text: Mac, Zhang and the others look on helplessly as THE MEG has
text: smashed the Zodiac and now has three meals to choose from.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
text: Francois is closest to the Zodiac, which has settled in the
text: water upside down, so he swims for it while Dimitri and Fan
dialog: race towards the Mazu.
dialog: 73.
text: Francois reaches the Zodiac and is about to climb on board
text: when SOMETHING knocks him from below - sending him back
text: across the surface about ten feet.
text: Francois’s face wrinkles. He’s in pain, but still mobile.
text: He swims for the Zodiac and as he’s about to climb on -- HE’S
text: KNOCKED back again.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: Are you playing with me?! Is that
dialog: it?!
text: He swims for the Zodiac a third time and MAKES IT!
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - ON THE OVER-TURNED ZODIAC - NIGHT
text: Francois collapses flat on his back. Safe for the moment.
text: Still waters. The only noise - his own heavy breathing.
text: And then we hear the unmistakable sound of rushing water.
text: Francois’ heavy breathing turns to laughter, as he takes a
text: moment, and enjoys the full moon as it hangs low in the sky.
speaker_heading: FRANCOIS
dialog: I hope I give you indigestion.
text: WHOOOOMMMMMPPPP - In a blur, the massive jaws of the Meg
text: break the surface. The Meg clamps down. The Pressurized Air
text: in the ZODIAC EXPLODES and Francois’ blood sprays across the
text: blue skies before raining down like a fine mist.
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU - PORT DECK
text: Suyin prepares to lower another Zodiac. DJ sees that.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Suyin, that’s suicide.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Yeah. Now are you going to help or
dialog: what?!
text: DJ nods. Of course he’s going to help.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
text: Dimitri and Fan keep swimming. Even after the echo of
text: Francois’ scream fades.
text: THEN THEY HEAR IT...
text: Like a jet engine ripping across the water. It’s the DORSAL
text: FIN of the Meg. Just barely breaking the surface, but
dialog: 74.
text: leaving a tremendous wake behind it, creating the visual
text: effect of a giant invisible monster coming right for them.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (stops swimming)
dialog: You know that joke, you don’t have
dialog: to be faster than the shark, you
dialog: just have to be faster than me?
dialog: But Fan can tell even if Dimitri sacrifices himself first, it
dialog: won’t make a difference. So she stops too.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: He gets you, then he gets me. Let
dialog: him get us together.
text: They embrace, at least they wont die alone.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: I might love you.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: I'll take it.
text: The sound of that dorsal is as loud as a JET-ENGINE on take-
text: off now. It’s about to reach them...
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - BELOW THE SURFACE - SAME
text: We see the MEG opening its jaws, about to bite when...
text: WHIIIISHHHHHH THHHUUUUUUD! Some kind of PROJECTILE on a
text: chain SLAMS into the Meg’s side! REVEAL--
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - JONAS
text: JONAS, in Suyin’s Abyss Glider, has FIRED THE PORT HORIZONTAL
text: ANCHOR (that we saw Suyin and DJ use earlier) INTO THE MEG.
text: Jonas then inverts his Abyss Glider UPSIDE DOWN...
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - BELOW THE SURFACE SAME
text: .»+-So that now the right ‘wing’ has a shot. He fires a
text: SECOND ANCHOR into the beast’s side. These are fatal wounds.
text: But not instantaneously fatal. And as the Abyss Glider and
text: the shark are now linked twice, it means Jonas is about to be
text: in for a wild ride.
text: We see the shark turn and twist...
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - JONAS
text: Jonas braces himself as the anchor chains go taut.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: This is gonna hurt--
scene_heading: WHIRL-SPIN-SMASH-BANG!
text: The Abyss Glider is violently accelerated and decelerated in
text: every direction. It’s like being on a roller coaster and the
text: bumper cars at the same time. With a touch of bull rider.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - SAME
text: The good news is DJ AND SUYIN, in their Zodiac, reach DIMITRI
text: and FAN and pull them from the water.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: (indicates the ocean)
dialog: Jonas.
text: From the surface, they can see GLIMPSES - THROUGH THE DARK
text: OCEAN WATERS - of the VIOLENT BALLET BELOW. The bloody MEG
text: twisting and turning. And the ABYSS GLIDER at its mercy.
scene_heading: INT. FASTBACK ONE - JONAS
text: Jonas, totally disoriented, blows the emergency BALLAST tanks
text: just as he’s THROWN FROM his seat when his HARNESS BREAKS.
text: His head smashes against the cockpit. Knocking him out cold.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK:
scene_heading: INT. SHIP’S INFIRMARY - MAZU - NIGHT
text: A LIGHT shines into ‘our eyes’. Dr. HELLER is the source of
dialog: it... We are...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Hey.
text: Jonas rests on a bed, nursing the world’s worst headache.
text: MEIYING holds his hand for comfort. SUYIN is with her, and
text: MAC lurks unseen by Jonas off to the side, WORRIED.
speaker_heading: JONAS (CONT'D)
dialog: How long was I out, Doc?
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: A few minutes. Hopefully, it’s just
dialog: a concussion, but we’re going to
dialog: run a battery of tests once we get
dialog: you back to the Mana One.
dialog: 76.
text: Now Jonas sees MAC. Makes eye contact with his friend.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Doc, I think I’m hallucinating. I
dialog: see a monster behind you...
text: Meiying starts to cackle.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Okay, he’s fine.
text: Mac gives Jonas, ‘I’m glad you’re okay’ nod, before
text: disappearing off screen. Jonas turns to Suyin:
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: What happened to the Meg?
scene_heading: EXT. AFT DECK - THE MAZU - SUNRISE
text: The Mazu’s remaining CRANE ARM is HOISTING the DEAD MEG out
text: of the water by its tail as DJ, FAN, and MORRIS look on.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: It’s spectacular...
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MAZU - CONTINUED
text: Mac sees the Meg coming up and then looks away, looks back to
text: where DIMITRI is showing ZHANG PHOTOGRAPHS OF the SMASHED
text: UNIS BOT that is partially wedged into the thermal vent.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: So we are the reason it could get
text: through the thermocline.
text: Dimitri nods.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: Based on where our BOTS were
dialog: placed, I'd say that’s BOT 14.
speaker_heading: MAC
text: Whacked into the side of that vent
text: like a tennis ball.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
text: Not a tennis ball, a thumb.
dialog: (Mac doesn’t understand)
text: The Bot’s partially obstructing the
dialog: flow of hot water out the vent -
text: like a thumb over a garden hose -
dialog: increasing the power of the water
dialog: that does jet out...
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
text: ...Creating a warm water hole up
text: through the thermocline. A hole
dialog: we're going to have to close.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: As soon as we get back to the Mana-
dialog: One, I can have the BOT self-
text: destruct via remote.
scene_heading: EXT. AFT DECK - THE MAZU - SUNRISE
text: All 35-feet of the MEG is now out of the water. Its tail
text: high in the air. Its once fearsome jaws now hovering a few
text: feet above the water.
text: DJ and FAN sit side-by-side on folding chairs, just staring
text: at the beast. The reverent silence is broken by...
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Will one of you take my picture?
text: She holds out her camera phone. Is she for real? Finally,
text: Fan relents.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Either of you want to join me?
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: I just had a meet and greet with
dialog: that thing’s digestive tract, so
dialog: I’m going to skip the photo op.
text: Click - Fan takes the shot. She hands Morris her camera
text: phone back. Morris realizes she may seem a tad insensitive.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: It’s been an emotional day. But I
dialog: want you both to remember, what
dialog: you've done here is unprecedented.
dialog: You're part of something truly
dialog: historic.
text: Morris walks back inside the ship. Once she’s gone--
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Is it just me, or were there actual
text: dollar signs in her eyes?
text: Fan chuckles. DJ is stoic.
speaker_heading: FAN (CONT'D)
dialog: “Hey guys, how long do you think it
dialog: would it take to train a Megaladon
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: FAN (CONT'D)
dialog: to do water ballet”
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: I swear, if she comes back with a
dialog: saddle, I’m going home.
text: DJ nods vacantly. Not really listening to her.
speaker_heading: FAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Remember the last time we played
dialog: poker? Remember what happened?
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: People focus too much on results...
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: I cleaned you out. Because you have
dialog: the world’s worst poker face. Now
dialog: what is wrong?
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That’s not the same Meg.
scene_heading: INTERCUT - INT. SHIP’S INFIRMARY - MAZU - DAY
text: Where Jonas has just told Suyin a similar thought.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: What do you mean, that’s not the
dialog: same Meg?
text: Jonas tries to sit up, but he’s too dizzy.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: How big is it? Thirty feet?
speaker_heading: SUYIN
text: Thirty-five.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: The one we saw below. The one that
text: killed Junjie, Carl, and Luc. It
dialog: was twice that size. You said so
dialog: yourself.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: You think there are two Megs? My
dialog: father was surprised even one
dialog: followed DJ’s trail because--
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (a step ahead of her)
dialog: --Because sharks are territorial,
dialog: he’s right. Assuming Megs behave
dialog: like other sharks, it should have
dialog: stayed down there. Unless...
dialog: (she waits for it)
dialog: Mature sharks don’t go exploring
dialog: new ground, they stay where they
dialog: know the food is. Juveniles on the
dialog: other hand...
text: ON SUYIN - as she grasps the meaning of what Jonas is saying.
scene_heading: EXT. AFT DECK - THE MAZU - MOMENTS LATER
text: DJ and Fan continue to debate.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Fan, I’m telling you, it didn’t
dialog: look bigger, it was bigger...
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: And DJ, I’m telling you, as someone
text: who curled up inside that thing’s
dialog: mouth, I can say with all
dialog: confidence, that is the Meg.
text: SUYIN arrives and heads straight for the Meg.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Suyin, settle something for us...
text: But Suyin doesn’t even acknowledge them, she’s so focused on
text: RAIDING a SUPPLY chest - grabbing a HARNESS, a BLOWTORCH, and
text: some EYE PROTECTION.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Suyin?
text: Suyin climbs halfway up the CRANE, attaches her HARNESS, then
text: REPELS down the side of the MEG. She reaches into the mouth,
text: GRABS ON, and then pulls herself up and INSIDE the carcass.
scene_heading: INT. MEG’S MOUTH / EXT. MAZU - CONTINUED
text: The darkness disappears as Suyin sparks up her blowtorch.
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: EXT. AFT DECK - THE MAZU - CONTINUED
text: Suyin’s operation attracts the attention of MORRIS, who comes
dialog: running back in--
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you
dialog: doing? We're going to want that
dialog: thing to look perfect!
text: SLIDE - That’s the sound that a MEG’S TOOTH, now liberated
text: from the jaw, makes as it SKIDS across the deck and stops at
text: FAN'S FEET. As Fan bends down to pick it up...
text: ...-Suyin pushes off the side of the shark, SWINGS out over
text: the ocean, and then back towards the deck. She RELEASES the
text: harness and lands in a trot towards her friends as MORRIS,
text: annoyed, rushes over to the Meg to inspect the damage.
speaker_heading: MORRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What were you thinking?!
text: FAN now has the tooth in her hands. She uses the ruler on
text: her iPhone to measure the size. Then her face goes pale.
text: She looks at SUYIN. Suyin nods.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: This is a baby.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: And the one below, wasn’t. So...
text: The women exchange a look. Fan almost dizzy from the news.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Can one of you translate please?
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: This Megaladon’s teeth are 8 cm. 8
dialog: cm means this monster is actually
text: just a kid. Maybe 6 months old.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: And while sharks aren’t very
dialog: loving, mothers usually stay close
dialog: to their offspring for the first
dialog: year.
text: MORRIS, who is right at the ship’s edge, and had been
text: mourning the damage done to her prize, suddenly BRIGHTENS
text: like it’s Christmas morning.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Wait are you saying there’s a
dialog: bigger Meg?
text: THE ANSWER -- COMES IN HORRIFYING SCALE AND VIOLENCE. As
text: suddenly the OCEAN BEHIND THE MAZU EXPLODES.
text: THE ‘MOMMA’ MEGALADON comes flying out of the water at a
text: sideways angle. She’s so massive that her arrival BLOCKS OUT
text: THE SUN, ECLIPSING THE MAZU, as her MIGHTY JAWS SNATCH the
text: smaller Meg that was once her child but is now her meal.
text: MORRIS’S POV -- All she sees is Shark. It would be her dream
dialog: come true except for the fact that--
text: THOOMP! The MEG takes Morris with it as it DISAPPEARS into
dialog: the sea!
dialog: 
text: But not before... SMASH...! Its MASSIVE TAIL crashes through
text: the AFT DECK of the Mazu with SUCH FORCE that the ship
text: PITCHES NOSE UP INTO THE AIR before SLAMMING BACK DOWN.
text: DJ’S POV - FOR A MOMENT - THINGS ARE DISORIENTING. There’s
text: NO SOUND, vision is BLURRY... Then, when the SOUND comes back
text: it’s FILLED WITH DEAFENING SIRENS. And when VISION is
text: restored, we see part of the aft deck is gone completely.
text: Fan and Suyin, both having nearly fallen into the sea, regain
text: their feet. Fan looks around for Morris.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Is she...?
text: Suyin shakes her head. Morris is gone. And the ship is
text: starting to sink. The two women collect DJ, who can only
text: process what’s happened though gallows humor.
speaker_heading: DJ
text: That settles the bigger Meg debate.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP’S INFIRMARY - MAZU - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jonas, having been tossed like a rag doll gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: JONAS

dialog: 82.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - ENGINE LEVEL - CONTINUED
text: MAC runs through a gauntlet of FLASHING LIGHTS towards the
text: engine room. He runs into DIMITRI, who is just coming from
text: there. They have to YELL over the siren to be heard.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
text: THE PROPS ARE GONE, BOTH ENGINES

speaker_heading: MAC

speaker_heading: MEIYING
speaker_heading: MOMMY!

speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: How bad is it?
text: Mac shakes his head. We’re going down. Off their looks:
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: It’s not all bad news. Since we
dialog: already took off non-essential
dialog: personnel, we have enough Zodiacs
dialog: for all of us.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Zodiacs?! With that thing out
dialog: there, are you nuts?
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: We still have the two subs.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (shakes his head)
text: Lost them with the aft deck.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: We need that helicopter.
text: ZHANG arrives as if on cue, and he has good news.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: I already radioed them. They’re
text: three minutes out.
text: Finally, a break.
scene_heading: INT. MAZU - THE HATCH TO THE HELIPAD - MINUTES LATER - DAY
text: The ENTIRE GROUP waits at the THRESHOLD OF THE HATCH that
text: leads outside to the HELIPAD. The Mazu is now LISTING 15
text: DEGREES TO STARBOARD. And the HELICOPTER, which they can see
text: approaching, has WHEELS for landing gear. This means:
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: We're listing too much for them to
dialog: land safely. They’re going to have
dialog: to use the basket - take us up one
dialog: at time.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: How long will that take?!
text: Mac looks Jonas - hopefully not too long.
scene_heading: INT. THE HELICOPTER - CIRCLING
text: In the belly of the Helicopter, the CO-PILOT finishes rigging
text: A RESCUE BASKET to the winch. He nods to the THIRD AIRMAN,
text: it’s ready. The Third Airman SLIDES THE SIDE DOOR OPEN.
text: Now it’s incredibly loud in here. The THIRD AIRMAN and the CO-
text: PILOT push the BASKET out. It FALLS a few feet before the
text: rope catches. Then the CO-PILOT turns on the WINCH.
text: The line unspools and the basket drops slowly...
scene_heading: INT. MAZU - THE HATCH TO THE HELIPAD - CONTINUED
text: Jonas can see the basket now...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Okay, it’s coming.
text: Suyin, holding Meiying, will go first. As they wait next to
text: Jonas, he can tell the little girl is terrified.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Have you got your dolphin on?
dialog: (off her nod)
dialog: Then you’re going to be okay.
speaker_heading: MEIYING
dialog: Jonas, you know that’s just a
dialog: superstition, right?
dialog: 84.
text: He laughs. Smiles at her. Then motions them to wait a few
text: more seconds. They watch the BASKET - getting closer.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - BELOW THE SURFACE
text: MEG’S POV - From DOWN HERE the sky looks white. And we can
text: see the dark shape of the Mazu, which is too big to eat...
text: Then there is the Helicopter which is too high in the sky...
text: But then there is that BASKET, dangling there, like a treat.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUED
text: The Third Airmen, looking down, judges the distance from the
text: BASKET to the deck. It’s nearly there.
speaker_heading: THIRD AIRMEN
dialog: Looking good...
text: He turns back for a moment, so he doesn’t see what WE SEE...
text: IN SLOW MOTION —- WITH ONLY SELECTED SOUNDS PIERCING THE
text: SILENCE...
dialog: 
text: The MEG is coming straight at the surface, about to breach.
scene_heading: EXT. HELIPAD - SLOW MOTION - SILENCE - CONTINUED
text: Jonas is outside with Suyin and Meiying when THEY SEE THE MEG
text: SOARING INTO THE SKY. Our first look at the beast in ALL ITS
text: IMPOSSIBLE GLORY. 70 feet long and 100 tons - yet it arcs
text: through the air gracefully to snatch THE BASKET.
text: JONAS -- turns and grabs Suyin/Meiying. We HEAR his ‘GET
text: BACK!!' as he drives them inside the ship while...
text: BEHIND JONAS -- the MEG PIVOTS around its meal, its head
text: turning back seaward as its TAIL carries on towards the sky.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - SLOW MOTION - SILENCE - CONTINUED
text: We hear, distant and hollow, the sound of the pilot screaming
text: to no one. ‘POWER!... POWER!... POWER...!’
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU/OCEAN - SLOW MOTION - SILENCE - CONTINUED
text: The MEG, basket in mouth, begins to drag the Helicopter down.
text: But then we hear a snap as, thankfully, the line breaks. And
text: the plunging Helicopter arrests its fatal descent.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - SLOW MOTION - SILENCE - CONTINUED
text: The PILOT breaks into a smile. We hear the joy in his
text: distant, hollow sounding voice - ”“WE’RE GONNA MAKE IT!”...
dialog: 85.
text: Then the MEG’S TAIL rises into FRAME outside the cockpit.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: Oh sh--
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU/OCEAN - RESUME FULL SPEED
text: SMASH! The Tail of the Meg SLAMS INTO THE HELICOPTER,
text: sending the Helicopter careening into the Mazu.
scene_heading: INT. MAZU - JUST INSIDE THE HATCH TO THE HELIPAD
text: Jonas pulls the HATCH shut as -- BA-BLAM! -- The Helicopter
text: EXPLODES with tremendous force and a noise so deafening that,
text: after it’s over, our group is surprised to be unhurt.
scene_heading: EXT. HELIPAD - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jonas opens the HATCH to see if there are any survivors.
text: But the deck is just filled with burning debris.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (long beat, to Mac)
dialog: How many Zodiacs do we have?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU/OCEAN - WIDE SHOT - DAY
text: The Mazu is listing badly, soon it will roll over.
scene_heading: EXT. MAZU - STARBOARD SIDE - DAY
text: THREE EMPTY ZODIACS float, tied to the deck. TWO are full-
text: sized. ONE is smaller. As everyone prepares to board, MAC
text: raises a pair of binoculars/laser ranger finder to his eyes.
scene_heading: MAC'S POV - THROUGH THE RANGE FINGER
text: The Mana-One looks huge at this magnification. And the
text: DISTANCE, per the little red digital read out, is...
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: 1 and 1/4 miles.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
text: So about five minutes.
text: Looks are exchanged among the group. That’s not a lot of
text: time. And yet, why does it feel like an eternity?
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Does anyone see the Meg?
dialog: 86.
text: ZHANG looks at his watch, he’d set his timer.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
text: Not for almost seven minutes now.
text: It’s now or never. The group jumps in quickly...
scene_heading: BOAT 1 - has DJ, MAC, and FAN
scene_heading: BOAT 2 - has JONAS, SUYIN, MEIYING and ZHANG
text: BOAT 3 - (the smaller one) - has DIMITRI and HELLER.
text: Before they fire up their engines, Zhang reminds them:
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: Predatory instinct is to look for
dialog: the weak link. If we stay
dialog: together, we have a better chance
dialog: of all of us making it.
dialog: (exhales )
dialog: I just want to say...
text: ..-but words fail him then. He feels responsible for every
text: person out here and that is weighing on him.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: You can finish that on the
dialog: platform. Because we’re all making
dialog: it and that’s an order.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: (scans the horizon)
text: Looks clear.
text: Three boats, Nine people, Eighteen eyes all search for the 70-
text: foot beast. But the ocean is calm. They have a chance.
scene_heading: --SFX: ENGINES AND WIND
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER
text: The THREE ZODIACS bound across the sea. At this speed, the
text: WIND, ENGINES, and SEA SPRAY combine in a sensory overload.
text: THE BOATS stay close together. The three pilots: JONAS,
text: DIMITRI, and MAC do an excellent job staying in formation.
scene_heading: VARIOUS POV’S - OF THE WATER
text: Everyone has a moment where they think they see it. There,
text: off to the left... No, behind us on the right... A passing
text: clump of SEAWEED nearly gives DJ a heart-attack.
dialog: 87.
text: BUT THE TRUTH IS -- There is no sign of the Meg.
scene_heading: QUICK CUTS - CLOSE-UPS
text: JONAS keeps his eyes fixed on the Mana-One. SUYIN holds
text: MEIYING close. ZHANG whispers a prayer.
text: The seas are clear.
text: MAC scans the horizon, DJ eyes the floor. FAN looks two
text: boats across at DIMITRI.
text: The seas still clear
text: DIMITRI eyes the gauges. And HELLER... Heller allows
text: himself the first hint of a SMILE...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: --THERE IT IS!
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: A MASSIVE DORSAL FIN is circling the sinking MAZU about 1/2
text: mile behind them.
dialog: THEY ALL WATCH
text: As the DORSAL FIN moves languidly, in profile, perpendicular
text: to the Zodiacs, seemingly disinterested. And for a moment,
text: it really seems as if the Meg doesn’t care about them.
text: BUT THEN THE DORSAL FIN TURNS
text: Straight for them. A wake grows as the Meg ACCELERATES, and
text: the fin sinks low in the water as its speed builds.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (calls to other boats)
dialog: STAY TOGETHER!
text: THE MEG’S SPEED is breath-taking. It becomes clear...
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: It’s going to reach us before we
dialog: make it to the platform.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - BEHIND THE ZODIACS
text: Speeding along with the MEG as it closes in fast.
scene_heading: INT. ZODIAC ONE - DJ, FAN, AND MAC
text: DJ sees that the Meg is angling for their boat or Suyin’s.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: MAC!
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I’M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN!
speaker_heading: JONAS (0.S.)
dialog: (distant, faint)
dialog: Stay together...
scene_heading: INT. ZODIAC THREE - HELLER AND DIMITRI
text: HELLER watches, horrified, as it becomes clear the MEG is
text: going to take down one of the other two boats.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: (not aware of that)
dialog: WE’RE HALFWAY THERE!
text: When he hears nothing in response, DIMITRI GLANCES BACK. He
text: sees the MEG is going for Boat 1 or Boat 2. He looks at FAN
text: in Boat 1... And the fear of losing her grips him.
speaker_heading: JONAS (0.S.)
dialog: (distant, faint)
dialog: Stay together...
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: To his credit, may not have a loved one on those boats, but
dialog: he can tell his partner does. He can also do the math. There
dialog: are only two people in this boat. It is a logical sacrifice.
speaker_heading: HELLER
dialog: (to Dimitri)
dialog: He’s wrong. If we stay together,
dialog: the MEG will get two of us before
dialog: we make the platform. But if one
text: boat peels off and leads it away...
text: DIMITRI processes what Heller is suggesting. He nods at
text: Heller and Heller nods back. It’s agreed. We’1ll do this.
scene_heading: INT. ZODIAC TWO - JONAS, SUYIN, MEIYING, AND ZHANG
text: JONAS sees HELLER looking his way. Heller gives hima
text: salute. It’s both an apology and a goodbye.
scene_heading: INT. ZODIAC ONE - FAN, DJ, AND MAC
text: FAN sees Dimitri staring at her. Like he’s looking at her
text: for the last time. And then she knows at once.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: No... No... NO...!
scene_heading: INT. ZODIAC THREE - DIMITRI AND ZHANG
text: DIMITRI turns the wheel and angles off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: QUICK CUTS BETWEEN ZODIACS ONE AND TWO
text: As the others react to the sacrifice. Zhang looks at the men
dialog: with pure admiration and heartbreaking guilt. Fan’s I love
dialog: you’s are heard only by the wind.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - WIDE
text: Dimitri begins a wide, sweeping turn, which DRAWS the MEG
text: off. He brings the ZODIAC to a heading that eventually is
text: almost directly away from the other boats.
speaker_heading: HEAVEN’S POV
text: From up here, we see the geography of the sacrifice, as
text: ZODIACS 1 and 2 are now separating from the MEG and ZODIAC 3.
scene_heading: INT. ZODIAC THREE - DIMITRI AND HELLER
text: The two men stand side by side, looking straight ahead, not
text: seeing the death that bears down on them from behind.
text: They face the sun, they face the light. They can HEAR the
text: Meg behind them now. Then the sun GROWS IMPOSSIBLY WHITE--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ZODIAC TWO - SUYIN, MEIYING, AND JONAS
text: Suyin angles Meiying away so she doesn’t see the EXPLOSION OF
text: WATER in the distance. There’s nothing too graphic about it.
text: And no screams can be heard. Just a giant burst of water and
text: then a terrible SILENCE.
scene_heading: INT. ZODIAC ONE - DJ, FAN, AND MAC
text: Fan buries her head in her hands, sobbing.
scene_heading: INT. ZODIAC TWO - SUYIN, MEIYING, AND JONAS
text: Jonas catches Suyin’s tear soaked eyes; one thing that gives
dialog: him great solace is that the MEG is too far away to be a
text: threat now. To either boat.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: We're going to make it. We're both
dialog: going to make it.
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: EXT. WATER - DAY
text: The Zodiacs PASS BY CAMERA, heading for the sanctuary of MANA
dialog: ONE. And we FADE...
speaker_heading: TO BLACK:
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
text: For a moment there is no SOUND... Just IMAGES...
text: A HAND along the back of Dimitri’s chair, which still bares
text: the IMPRINT of Dimitri’s back.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (FAINT, DISTANT)
dialog: Fan...
text: FINGERS tracing some DESIGN DOODLES that Dimitri had been
dialog: scribbling...
speaker_heading: SUYIN (FAINT, DISTANT)
dialog: Fan...
text: Finally stopping on a QUICK SKETCH Dimitri made of Fan
text: herself, when she wasn’t looking.
scene_heading: ALL SOUND RETURNS-—
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Fan? Are you going to be okay?
dialog: Because we need you.
text: Before she can answer, Fan feels a TUG at her side. MEIYING
text: is there, offering her a sip of her SODA. Fan touches
text: Meiying’s cheek: ‘No, but thanks.’
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: (to Suyin)
dialog: I’m good.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
text: Ping Bot 14 and see if it responds.
dialog: We need to close that hole in the
dialog: thermocline.
text: ON MEIYING - watching as FAN and SUYIN go to work. Then
text: turning to see JONAS, MAC and DJ in a heated conversation.
text: Meiying exhales. Not interested in either talk.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL (O-LEVEL) - MOMENTS LATER
text: Ding. The elevator opens and MEIYING steps out into the all-
text: glass world of the O-LEVEL.
dialog: 91.
text: She walks forward, drawn by something she sees IN THE OCEAN,
text: beyond the RIM of the structure. She reaches the end,
text: extends her hands, her fingers tracing the glass.
text: A HUMPBACK WHALE rolls gracefully onto its belly, its NEWBORN
text: CALF close to its side. Meiying smiles.
speaker_heading: FAN (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Internal cooling off... Pressure
dialog: regulators shut down...
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
text: The TACTICAL DISPLAY showing data from BOT 14 begins to flash
text: red. Fan's fingers fly across the keyboard--
speaker_heading: FAN
text: ...-Bot self-destruct in 10. 5.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP OCEAN - BOT 14 - WEDGED IN THE THERMAL VENT
text: BLAM!! Bot 14 explodes with a flash. Its pieces jetted
text: upward by the power of the THERMAL VENT, then scattered.
text: The TELL TALE COLUMN OF SUPER-HEATED WATER, which had
text: stretched upwards like a TRANSLUCENT elevator shaft,
speaker_heading: DISAPPEARS.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
text: Fan turns to Suyin, Mac, DJ and Jonas. She smiles.
speaker_heading: FAN
text: The hole is gone.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: So nothing else can get up here.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Yeah, but that also means what came
text: up is staying up.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: The Meg was never going back down.
dialog: Where it came from it was just
dialog: another part of the food chain.
dialog: Maybe not even the baddest thing on
dialog: the block. But up here...
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL (O-LEVEL) - DAY
text: Meiying, face pressed against the glass, delights in watching
dialog: the Whales.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE
dialog: The sound
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: JONAS (V.O.)
dialog: Up here, she’s the apex predator,
dialog: with no natural enemies, and an
dialog: unlimited supply of food.
scene_heading: CONTROL CENTER - DAY
text: of the DOOR. A frustrated Dr. Zhang enters.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
text: The Navy is sending a helicopter
dialog: for us, ETA 40 minutes.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: What about the Meg?
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: They're running my request for
text: military support up the line, but
dialog: it’s not like they have a protocol
dialog: to deal with this--
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: --Because they don’t believe it.
text: The reality of that hangs there. Suyin shakes her head--
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Well, they’re about to...
text: She indicates the waters NORTH of HAINAN ISLAND on the map.
dialog: --SLAM.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (CONT’D)
text: Half the fishing fleet is working
dialog: these waters. That’s fifty, sixty
dialog: boats. And the Meg is gonna tear
dialog: right through them. After that
dialog: comes 30,000 tourists on the
dialog: beaches at Sanya Bay--
text: The DCC is rocked by an IMPACT. Something has hit
text: them. Reflexively, Fan pulls up CAMERA FEEDS of THE WATERS
text: SURROUNDING THE MANA-ONE. That something is the MEG.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Looks like she’s got some
dialog: unfinished business first.
text: Several MONITORS now show various angles of the massive beast
text: rushing the Mana-One.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Hang on!
dialog: 93.
text: --SLAM! THIS IMPACT is stronger. An EXPLOSION of concussive
text: force that triggers A DEAFENING CACOPHONY OF ALARMS--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FAN
text: WE'VE GOT BREACHES! TAKING ON
scene_heading: WATER AT D-LEVEL, F-LEVEL, J-LEVEL--
text: SUYIN turns to check on Meiying -- only to realize her
dialog: daughter isn’t there.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: Meiying!
text: --SLAM! This THIRD IMPACT is THE KNOCK-OUT PUNCH. One by
text: one, every system shuts down: THUNK - THUNK - THUNK - THUNK
text: And they are plunged into TOTAL DARKNESS.
scene_heading: EXT/INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL (O-LEVEL) - DAY
text: We're looking in at Meiying from outside the glass. Behind
text: her, the lights go out, but she doesn’t notice because she’s
text: TRANSFIXED by what’s unfolding in front of her.
text: IN THE REFLECTION OF THE GLASS, we can see the two whales.
text: The Mother Whale is being shaken violently.
text: REVEAL - the MEG has the whale in her jaws and is ripping it
text: to pieces. It’s a staggering demonstration of the true power
text: of this beast - now unleashed in our world. As blood POURS
text: from the dying whale, the sea becomes a THICK RED FOG--
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DAY
text: ALARMS still screaming. SUYIN (with JONAS) JABS repeatedly
text: at the elevator button, but it won’t work until--
speaker_heading: FAN
scene_heading: EMERGENCY POWER -- ON-LINE!
text: DARKNESS is replaced by eerie RED LIGHTING and -- DING the
text: ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. As Jonas and Suyin head down to get
text: Meiying, Fan checks the damage control screen.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: How bad is it?
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Worse.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL - DAY
text: Meiying stares out at the thick red fog (blood). Then, it
text: begins to clear in front of her. Revealing A BLACK HOLE.
dialog: 94.
text: Ding. JONAS AND SUYIN arrive. And what they see causes
text: their hearts to skip a beat. That’s not a BLACK HOLE...
text: IT’S THE MEG.
scene_heading: EXT. OBSERVATION LEVEL - SAME
text: The MEG hovers in the current, its side abutting the O-level,
text: its MASSIVE EYE inches away from Suyin’s little girl.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL - CONTINUED
text: For a beat, no one dares move. Then the EYE darts away--
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: SUYIN, GO!--
text: SUYIN races down the glass ‘spoke’ to save her daughter while
text: the MEG makes a 270-degree turn and comes at Meiying head-on.
text: Jaws opening...
text: IT ALL HAPPENS IN LESS THAN A SECOND
dialog: 
text: Suyin grabs Meiying and dives laterally, running along the
text: rim of the station just as -- SMASH -- the MEG hits! It
text: obliterates the place where Meiying just stood, and destroys
text: THAT ENTIRE CORRIDOR/SPOKE, as if it were made of smoke.
scene_heading: AUTOMATIC PRESSURE DOORS
text: Seal off the O-level where that SPOKE used to be as SMASH -—
text: SMASH - the MEG takes out TWO MORE SPOKES - plowing through
text: them sideways - before diving away.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (watching the Meg)
dialog: IT’S COMING AROUND!
scene_heading: INT. O-LEVEL - 4TH SPOKE - DAY
text: Suyin and Meiying reach the next intact ‘spoke’ - turn - and
text: sprint for the elevator. Suyin can see the MEG coming at
text: them from directly below. They aren’t going to make it.
scene_heading: IN SLOW-MOTION
text: Suyin LEAPS into the air and THROWS her daughter forward, as
text: the CORRIDOR beneath them SHATTERS from the Meg’s impact.
text: Still airborne, Meiying and Suyin suddenly collide with
text: JONAS, sliding into frame so as to CATCH MEIYING and PULL
dialog: SUYIN through the--
scene_heading: RAPIDLY CLOSING PRESSURE DOORS--
dialog: 95.
text: Which SNAP SHUT just after they’re all safely on the elevator
dialog: side.
scene_heading: RESUME - FULL SPEED
text: SLAM! The Meg obliterates Spoke 4 -- and Jonas, Suyin, and
text: Meiying FALL BACKWARDS into the ELEVATOR as its doors close.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER - DEAFENING ALARMS - DAY
text: Everyone has been knocked to the floor. ELECTRICAL ARCS
text: spark around them. WATER jets through SEAMS IN THE WALLS.
text: FAN struggles to her knees and finds herself looking at
text: MEIYING’S SODA CAN as it is CRUSHED by an invisible hand!
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: DR. ZHANG!...
text: Plastic bottles of water collapse in on themselves. Plasma
text: screens explode as if hit by unseen hammers.
text: Zhang looks at the INTERNAL PRESSURE GAUGES. They are sky-
text: rocketing into the RED. Heading for fatal levels fast.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
text: THE PRESSURE VESSEL IS FAILING. WE
dialog: HAVE TO GET TOPSIDE, NOW--
text: Ding -- JONAS, SUYIN, and MEIYING arrive in the Elevator.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Going up?
scene_heading: INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: It’s a long ride to the top. Anxious silence until...
text: SCRAAAAAAYYYY... They begin to hear a TERRIBLE SOUND. A
text: sound that grows LOUDER as they reach the top deck and the
dialog: doors OPEN on to--
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - MAIN PLATFORM - DAY
text: --A sight out of Dante. Black SMOKE swirls in the wind.
text: FIRES burn across the deck. And that SCRAAAAYYYY - is the
text: MANA-ONE'’s LOADING CRANE as it comes CRASHING to the deck!
text: SMASH! - the crane hits just a few feet in front them! When
text: the dust clears, the group take stock of their situation.
dialog: 96.
text: ON JONAS - as he stares at the fallen CRANE. Something about
text: it triggers an idea in his mind... He starts to think...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: How long before that helicopter
dialog: gets here!?
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: 30 minutes.
text: ON JONAS - STILL THINKING - It’s just an ordinary crane...
dialog: Ordinary construction crane... Construction...
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: 30 minutes? This thing will be at
dialog: the bottom of the ocean in 30
dialog: minutes!
text: ON JONAS - As the idea snaps into place.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: It’s enough time.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: For us to kill that Meg.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: (lights up)
dialog: Now we're talking.
text: But the rest of the team stare at him. Kill the Meg?
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Even if rescue gets here for us,
dialog: that doesn’t help the fishing
dialog: boats, or the tourists. Like it or
dialog: not, we’re the ones responsible for
dialog: this. So I’m not going anywhere
dialog: until that thing’s dead -- or I am.
text: ON ZHANG - as he looks at Jonas. And then nods.
speaker_heading: ZHANG
dialog: What do have you in mind?
scene_heading: JUMP FORWARD TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - AS SEEN FROM JUST UNDERWATER
text: Peace, tranquility... THEN WE SEE SOMETHING FALLING TOWARDS
text: US... Is it TWO ASTRONAUTS IN SPACE SUITS...?
dialog: 97.
text: SPLASH! --- No, it’s JONAS and SUYIN, each in DEEP-SEA
text: DIVING SUITS, with WEIGHT BELTS that allow them to drop as
text: fast sky divers, and RECOVERY WIRES hooked to their suits.
scene_heading: GO BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - MAIN PLATFORM
text: Jonas begins to outline his plan.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: When you built this platform, you
text: set the foundation in bedrock.
dialog: Which means explosives. Still have
dialog: any?
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: We do, but they’re in an underwater
text: bunker near the base of the
text: station. It’s 300 meters down.
text: Jonas nods. 300 meters down. That won’t be a problem...
scene_heading: JUMP FORWARD TO:
scene_heading: JONAS AND SUYIN’S POVS - FROM INSIDE THE SUITS
text: We're along for a TERRIFYING, TURBULENT, and CLAUSTROPHOBIC
text: ride. Outside sounds are muted - while our own breathing
text: seems amplified. OUR FIELD OF VIEW is limited to what’s
text: directly in front of us. We can just make out, to one side,
text: the SUPERSTRUCTURE of the Mana-One as we drop down along it,
text: rapidly. Very rapidly.
scene_heading: GO BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - MAIN PLATFORM
dialog: Jonas continues...
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: This all started with the BOTs. The
dialog: Meg was drawn to them as soon as
dialog: you turned them on. So Suyin and I
dialog: will go down to that bunker. We’1l
dialog: get explosives and rig a bomb. DJ,
dialog: Fan, you two bring down a BOT.
dialog: Then, we connect the bomb to the
dialog: Bot, turn it on, and -
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: --Boom - end of story.
scene_heading: JUMP FORWARD TO:
dialog: 98.
scene_heading: JONAS AND SUYIN’S POVS - FROM INSIDE THE SUITS
text: The TERROR RIDE continues. It’s like driving flat out
dialog: through the fog, hoping you don’t hit something. FISH AND
text: AQUATIC LIFE rush up at us, seemingly out of nowhere!
scene_heading: GO BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - MAIN PLATFORM
text: DJ shakes his head. There’s a problem.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Jonas, that crane was our last
dialog: chance of getting a BOT down there.
dialog: The Meg already took out all our
dialog: subs. We've got nothing.
text: Jonas is caught. That’s a deal-breaker.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Actually there is something.
dialog: An unmanned prototype Dimitri was
text: working on. It’s small, but
dialog: powerful enough to take a Bot.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Since when was Dimitri interested
dialog: in unmanned subs?
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Since the day you tried to ask me
dialog: out.
text: That hangs there a beat. All of them caught. A moment of
dialog: humanity. Of levity at DJ’s expense. They all needed that.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Okay people, let’s get to work!
scene_heading: FORWARD TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - UNDERWATER
text: JONAS and SUYIN whizz by, like two base jumpers, dropping
dialog: along the Mana-One.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-1 - MAIN PLATFORM
text: Everyone disperses to start the plan. Jonas holds Mac back.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: None of this works if you don’t get
text: power back to the main line.
dialog: There’s a reason Jonas saved this for last. It’s impossible.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Jonas, I don’t know if this Meg can
dialog: read a blueprint, but she managed
dialog: to take out all our generators.
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Dimitri is who we need.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: You’re who we've got.
text: Mac shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: I can’t tell if this plan is crazy,
dialog: or stupid.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Only one way to find out.
dialog: Off their smiles...
speaker_heading: END SEQUENCE
scene_heading: ON JONAS - INSIDE HIS SUIT - STILL IN FREE-FALL
text: A matching smile on Jonas’s face as his breakneck descent
text: continues. A smile that EXPLODES INTO AGONY WHEN--SNAAAP!
speaker_heading: JONAS
text: AAAARRRRRRRGGGGHHHHH !
text: Jonas’s descent is STOPPED ABRUPTLY, causing him to cry out,
text: as Suyin DISAPPEARS into the waters below.
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - DECK
text: Zhang, who is standing the TWO SPOOLS OF WIRE attached to
text: their suits, sees Jonas’s wire has stopped dead.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
text: SOMETHING HAPPENED TO JONAS!
scene_heading: JONAS’S POV - FROM INSIDE HIS SUIT
text: His breathing labored, Jonas shakes off the pain and looks
text: up. His LINE got SNAGGED on part of the MANA-ONE.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: I’m okay. But my recovery line is
text: all tangled up in the platform.
scene_heading: SUYIN’S POV - RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE BOTTOM
text: She's at 300 meters and the sea floor is rushing towards her.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (MIC)
dialog: Floor in sight, Weight belt
dialog: released...
scene_heading: EXT. SEA-FLOOR (320 METERS) - CONTINUED
text: Suyin hits the QUICK RELEASE ON HER WEIGHT BELT, freeing her
text: from the dropping mass of lead. The BELT continues on
text: rapidly, STRIKING the sandy bottom like a meteor...
text: But Suyin SLOWS RAPIDLY, and by the time she reaches the
text: bottom, her momentum is dissipated by one forward roll. She
text: LOOKS UP for Jonas and sees him, dangling high up there, like
text: some toy on a string, totally defenseless.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN / INT. SUIT - JONAS’S POV
text: Jonas begins to saw at the line his trusty knife.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: I’m cutting free.
speaker_heading: ZHANG (RADIO)
dialog: How do we get you back to the
dialog: surface?
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: One problem at a time.
text: At least this won’t take very long, the WIRE begins to fray
text: quickly. SNAP!... SNAP!... He’s free and begins to fall--
speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
dialog: --WAIT, JONAS DON'T!
text: Reflexively, Jonas grabs for the wire and catches it. But
text: he’s holding his entire weight, and that of the belt, by one
text: gloved hand. And his grip is slipping, fast.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (RADIO)
dialog: It’s passing right beneath you.
scene_heading: JONAS LOOKS DOWN
text: The MEG’s size, compared to Jonas’s, is almost comical. It’s
text: like a COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE is passing 10 feet beneath him.
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: JONAS LOOKS UP
text: His GLOVED HAND can’t maintain a grip on the wire. He
text: watches the line slip from his fingers... And then...
speaker_heading: JONAS DROPS
text: Just as the MEG finishes passing though! WHOOOSH - it’s so
text: close that JONAS can feel the heat of MEG’S massive tail as
text: it swipes, lethally, just inches from him his face.
scene_heading: EXT. SEA-FLOOR (320 METERS) - MOMENTS LATER
text: Suyin watches as Jonas approaches. Like her, he ditches the
text: weight belt with about 15 meters to go, then slows himself to
text: make a soft landing. Suyin stares at him.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Let’s get to the bunker. Because I
dialog: really want to blow that thing up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT/EXT. MANA ONE - POWER STATION - DAY
text: The central power station is located one floor below the main
text: deck, and the stairwell to it has collapsed, meaning MAC has
text: to CRAWL down the twisted remains of the staircase...
text: Then CRAWL across the top of the power station... Then REPEL
text: off its side, dangling out over the water, so he can do the
text: repairs there. Mac looks down at a Medusa’s hair tangle of
text: ELECTRICAL wires, half of which are hanging in the WATER.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: What could go wrong here?
text: As soon as he says that, WHAM! The MEG RAMS the station (off-
text: screen) causing this ENTIRE PLATFORM TO DROP FIVE FEET CLOSER
text: TO THE SEA before finally catching. Mac’s adrenaline spikes.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (to the universe)
dialog: That was a rhetorical question!
text: WHAM! The MEG hits the station again...
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: INT. MANA-ONE - EXTERNAL HALLWAY
text: ..-Rattling the entire Mana-one as the CAMERA now FOLLOWS
text: BEHIND DJ AND FAN -- as they RUN down a partially-flooded
text: industrial hallway, with only DJ's FLASHLIGHT guiding them.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Is it me, or does it seem like
dialog: she’s getting more pissed off?
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: She can join the club.
text: DJ darts around a corner, FAN on his heels as...
text: WHAM! The MEG hits again and suddenly DAYLIGHT replaces
text: darkness as the entire hallway in front of them DISAPPEARS!
dialog: 
text: The MEG has taken out the SKYWAY connecting the north side of
text: the Mana-One to the south side. And it’s done that just as
text: DJ was leading Fan onto that skyway at break-neck speed!
text: DJ watches/feels as the corridor around him seems to vanish,
text: and suddenly he’s in mid-air, about to drop into the lethal
text: waters below. For a moment, time stands still...
text: Then a hand reaches into frame and--
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: I GOT YoU!
text: FAN pulls him back from certain death using every last bit of
text: energy she’s got. The two of them fall back into the safety
text: of what’s left of the skyway. For a moment, neither can do
dialog: anything but breathe.
text: Finally, they get to their feet. And DJ looks straight into
text: the eyes of the woman who just saved his life.
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Just so we’re clear, I wasn’t
dialog: asking you out. I was being polite
dialog: because you were new here.
text: Fan stares at him. About to nail him with a clever rejoinder
text: when -- WOOOOSH -- DJ vanishes. FALLING into the ocean as
text: more of the skyway collapses. Fan can only watch him go...
scene_heading: EXT. FROM BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN - CONTINUED
text: Through the churning water, we see DJ falling backwards into
text: the sea. His IMPACT SPLASH rings out like a dinner bell.
dialog: 103.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
text: DJ surfaces and finds himself surrounded by large chunks of
text: floating DEBRIS. He looks for something big enough to
text: protect him from the shark, but then realizes that’s futile.
text: So he looks up at the Mana-One. He has NO WAY of climbing
text: back up on the South side, where Fan is. His only choice is
dialog: to swim the 50 meters the skyway used to span and reach the
text: North Side, where the DIVE PLATFORM sits at just above water
text: level. A safe haven. If he can get there.
text: DJ is about to swim for it when--
speaker_heading: FAN (0.S.)
dialog: DJ. Don’t. Move.
text: He looks up at Fan. He’s never seen her so scared in her
dialog: life.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - FAN’S POV
text: Now we see why. THE MEG is just a few meters beneath the
text: surface of the water, DIRECTLY UNDER DJ, studying him.
text: ON DJ - as he begins to hyperventilate from fear. He has to
text: fight the urge to move. An urge coming from every cell in
text: his body.
text: ON FAN - she stares directly into his eyes, trying to keep
dialog: him centered. Keep looking at me. Relax. Just relax.
text: ON DJ - trying not to cry out as the MEG’S MASSIVE NOSE
text: lazily brushes him. As if to see - is this just a piece of
dialog: debris, or should I eat it...?
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: You're OK. You’re Ok.
text: DJ looks up at her - easy for her to say! Then suddenly DJ
text: is BLINDED BY A BEAM OF LIGHT. What the?!
text: It’s his flashlight. The nudge from the Meg liberated it
text: from DJ's pocket, it’s about to fall in the water, and it’s
dialog: still on!
speaker_heading: DJ
dialog: Oh no...
text: ON THE FLASHLIGHT as it leaves the confines of DJ’s pocket
text: and begins to sink. DJ knows if he grabs for it, the MEG
text: will devour him. So he remains motionless. Helpless to stop
text: the flashlight’s fall.
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: EXT. BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
text: The flashlight TUMBLES end over end - down past the massive
text: creature - which takes no notice of such a tiny spec.
text: But then, like an undersea spotlight, the flashlight’s beam
text: sweeps the eyes of the MEG, before disappearing below.
text: The MEG, triggered, follows it into the depths.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
text: As DJ waits for death, FAN realizes the MEG has vanished.
dialog: But where is it...?
text: WHAM! The answer nearly sends Fan into the ocean herself.
text: The MEG has moved off, and decided to strike one of the TWO
text: ZODIACS tied up at the dock. It takes half the dock with it!
text: The bad news is - with the dock damaged - that part of the
text: station begins to take on water. The good news is - all that
dialog: is happening a good distance away from where DJ is!
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: DJ! Go! Gol
text: DJ, amazed to still be alive, SWIMS as fast as he can...
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - MANA-ONE - CONTINUED
text: DJ manages only a few strokes BEFORE THE MEG’S DORSAL FIN
text: STOPS in the water, like it just figured out it’s been duped.
text: It violently spins around and heads straight for DJ, cutting
text: through the ocean like a Miter saw.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - SURFACE LEVEL
text: WIDER - on DJ as he pushes forward. Over his shoulder, we
text: begin to see the massive dorsal fin, rising into frame as it
text: gets closer. If DJ looks back, he’s dead.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - BELOW SURFACE
text: A TRAILER SHOT - The tiny silhouette of the man... And the
text: incredible scale of the monster that’s about to catch him.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN SURFACE
text: CLOSE ON DJ - Head down. Desperate.
text: CLOSE ON THE MEG - mouth opening wide for feeding...
dialog: 105.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LOADING DOCK - SOUTH SIDE OF MANA ONE
text: In one fluid motion, DJ swings himself up onto the deck, then
text: rolls as far away from the water as he can get so when --
text: SLAM -- THE MEG RAMS THE SIDE OF THE LOADING AREA -- he
text: remains safely out of reach.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN PLATFORM - NORTH SIDE OF MANA ONE
text: Fan lets a scram of celebration. He made it. He made it!!
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LOADING DOCK - SOUTH SIDE OF MANA ONE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE FACILITY - 300 METERS BELOW THE SURFACE - DAY

text: CLOSE ON - THE SAME HANDS - now securing the pyramid with
text: strategic strips of duct tape.
text: CLOSE ON - THE SAME HANDS - as they connect a small IMPACT

text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Suyin watching Jonas finish his work.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: My ex-wife always said I was good
dialog: at blowing things up.
text: Jonas and Suyin load the bomb into a BACKPACK. Bomb safely
text: inside, Jonas zips up the pack before Suyin carefully puts it
text: on his back. She waits for him to start walking.
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: (I have a bomb on my back)
dialog: You should go in front of me.
text: Suyin nods, good point. As she starts for the Air-Lock,
text: SOMETHING ON THE SUPPLY SHELF catches Jonas’s eye.
text: Hand Flares. He thinks a moment. Then takes two.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: How’s it going up there, Mac?
scene_heading: INT/EXT. MANA ONE - POWER STATION - DAY
text: MAC'S SWEAT DRENCHED EYES focus on the breaker panel with
text: eager anticipation. He slams down the central switch
text: and...BOOM!!! An explosion of sparks sends him reeling and
text: almost off the edge of the power station. He’s blown the
text: fuse board.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAC (MIC)
dialog: Oh, it’s going great.
text: He opens up the BOARD and begins to remove a fuse with his
text: FINGERS...
scene_heading: INT. DIVE PLATFORM - DAY
text: While FAN’S FINGERS FLY across the keys of a LAPTOP.
scene_heading: ON SCREEN we see: RSV-NAVIGATION CONTROLS - LINKING...
scene_heading: LINKING... CONNECTED.
text: BEGIN POWER UP SEQUENCE...
text: Machine-sounds begin to fill the air behind Fan. Their
text: source, THE UNMANNED SUBMERSIBLE, comes into view as DJ
text: brings it out of Dimitri’s lab, pulling it along an overhead
text: conveyor belt.
speaker_heading: FAN (MIC)
dialog: Jonas, we're one minute to launch.
scene_heading: EXT. SEA-FLOOR - STORAGE FACILITY - CONTINUED
text: Jonas and Suyin, just visible in the gloaming, walk clear of
text: the storage facility and look up at the DARK MANA-ONE.
speaker_heading: FAN (RADIO)
dialog: Camera range is limited. So you’ll
dialog: have to guide me when I get close.
scene_heading: INT MANA ONE - POWER CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUED
text: Mac is now at the main control board for the entire power
text: station. FLIP - FLIP - FLIP... He powers up the Main Bus,
text: and for a moment it looks like it will work until-
text: BOOM! Again. Something goes wrong. This time forcing MAC
text: to duck down for cover UNDER THE DESK.
dialog: 107.
text: While down there he sees an OPEN DRAWER. In it, is a small
text: box labeled, “in case of emergency”. He opens the box and
text: finds a bottle of 1942 Don Julio tequila. He stares at it.
speaker_heading: FAN (RADIO)
text: RSV launched...
scene_heading: INT. DIVE PLATFORM - VIEW FROM UNDERWATER
text: THE UNMANNED SUB descends RIGHT AT US... It passes by

scene_heading: INT. DIVE PLATFORM - CONTINUED

text: below. Next to him, FAN works the sub’s controls, which are
text: linked to a LAPTOP that gives her a view from its NOSE CAM.
speaker_heading: FAN (MIC)
dialog: Bot clear and coming down to you.
scene_heading: EXT. SEA-FLOOR - STORAGE FACILITY - CONTINUED

text: CLOSE ON THE DEPTH READ-OUT - now clicking past 150 meters.
scene_heading: EXT. SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
text: Like tumbleweeds blowing across a ghost town at high-noon,
text: STRANGE CLUMPS of PLANT LIFE roll by JONAS and SUYIN’S FEET.
speaker_heading: FAN (RADIO - STATIC)
dialog: That’s 150. You should see it any
dialog: second now...
dialog: 108.
text: JONAS AND SUYIN - STRAINING THEIR EYES to look above them.
text: But it’s nearly impossible with the MANA-ONE still dark.
scene_heading: INT MANA ONE - POWER CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUED
text: CLOSE ON - MAC - as finishes a re-patch and, with an exhale,
text: POWERS IT UP. FLIP - FLIP - FLIP... Before he throws the
text: final switch he takes a ceremonial ‘good luck’ sip of the
text: tequila, puts the bottle down and then.... FLIP...
dialog: No explosion... No boom....
text: Just a SERIES of GREEN LIGHTS COMING ON.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DIVE CONTROL CENTER
text: All the power comes back on in the abandoned DCC. We watch
text: as the INTERNAL PRESSURE GAUGES return to NORMAL.
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE
text: External lights go on. Zhang smiles at Meiying. Good news.
scene_heading: EXT. SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
text: Jonas and Suyin watch as the MANA-ONE blossoms to life. It’s
text: like being at the foot of the Eifel tower at night.
text: And thanks to the light they can now see the SUBMERSIBLE AND
text: THE BOT - high above them - but making progress.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: RSV in sight...
text: But his voice TRAILS OFF because suddenly the SUB and the BOT
text: vanishes in A SHADOW.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE PLATFORM - CONTINUED
text: PFFFFFT! - STATIC replaces the picture from submersible’s
text: nose cam. The RSV stops responding to controls...
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: What the...?
scene_heading: EXT. SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
text: Gradually, the shadow clears... And suddenly Jonas and Suyin
text: are looking at THE BOT -- no longer tethered to anything --
text: dropping like a ROCK -- right down on top of them!
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: LOOK OUT!
dialog: 109.
text: JONAS pushes SUYIN to cover behind rocky coral as -- SMASH--
text: THE BOT slams into the sea-floor, sending debris flying.
text: For a minute, we can’t see anything through the all the SAND
text: that’s been kicked up by impact.
speaker_heading: ZHANG (RADIO)
dialog: Jonas, come in! Jonas, Suyin!
text: Then the SAND clears. Jonas and Suyin are okay. But their

speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: Fan, this is the moment you tell me
dialog: Dimitri made two of those things.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE PLATFORM - CONTINUED
text: Fan stares at her controls, still trying to re-establish

speaker_heading: DJ (MIC)
dialog: That's a negative, Jonas.
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - DAY

speaker_heading: MAC

scene_heading: EXT. SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
text: Jonas has another way. He exhales.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: Okay, then. DJ and Fan get to the
text: Zodiac. As soon as Suyin surfaces,
dialog: you load up and get as far away
dialog: from here as you can.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (MIC)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Jonas shows her the hand flares.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: Back-up plan. I use these to lure
dialog: it to the O-level, we know how much
dialog: it likes smashing that place up.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (MIC)
dialog: That’s a suicide mission.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: Not necessarily. It is, however, a
dialog: solo mission so... Dr. Zhang,
dialog: you're clear to bring Suyin up...
speaker_heading: SUYIN (MIC)
dialog: No...
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - DAY
text: DJ and Fan have joined Mac, Zhang, and Meiying.
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)

speaker_heading: ZHANG (MIC)
dialog: Jonas, let’s think a moment--
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: Dammit, it’s this or we all lose.
dialog: Now bring your daughter back to her
dialog: daughter, am I clear?
scene_heading: EXT. SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
text: Suyin shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (MIC)
dialog: No, we're in this together...
text: She reaches out with a tether hook - hoping to connect
text: Jonas’s suit to hers but just before she can...
text: She is pulled away. She’s being pulled up.
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - DAY
text: Mac has thrown the lever himself.
speaker_heading: SUYIN (MIC)
dialog: I’m cutting loose!
scene_heading: EXT. SEA-FLOOR - CONTINUED
text: She can still see Jonas - he looks at her.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: Please don’t.
text: The distance between them growing... The flickering lights of

text: Then she disappears into the haze.
dialog: 111.
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - 320 METERS DOWN

speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: Mac. I forgot to say - great job
dialog: with the power. Not that I ever
dialog: doubted you.
scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - DOCK - DAY

text: boards the lone Zodiac tied to what’s left of the dock.
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)
dialog: Okay, maybe I did...
speaker_heading: MAC (MIC)
dialog: So, a back-up plan, huh?
scene_heading: INT. MANA-ONE - EMERGENCY STAIRWELL - SAME

scene_heading: INT. MANA-ONE - THE O-LEVEL - CONTINUED

text: SPOKES - AND THE RIM THAT IS ATTACHED TO THEM ALL.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: You just be ready to get out of
dialog: here when I tell you.
text: He presses the elevator button. Waits and then - ding. It
text: arrives. He steps inside, presses the button for the
text: surface, then WEDGES the door so it doesn’t go anywhere.
text: THEN JONAS TURNS AND WALKS DOWN THE CENTER SPOKE
text: He’s heading towards the rim, appreciating the magnificent
dialog: structure this used to be.
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: Dr. Zhang, I don’t know what kind
dialog: of security deposit you put down on
dialog: this place, but I don’t think

speaker_heading: ZHANG (RADIO)
dialog: Whatever it takes, Jonas....

scene_heading: EXT. MANA-ONE - DOCK

scene_heading: INT. MANA-ONE - THE O-LEVEL - CONTINUED
text: Jonas, pleased Suyin has said this. Happy to hear her voice.

text: The ZODIAC’s engine roars to life.
scene_heading: EXT. 300 METERS DOWN - THE OCEAN - SAME
text: The noise of the ZODIAC is more of a low vibration down

text: It begins its ascent but then...
text: TWINKLING RED-LIGHTS catch its attention.
dialog: It’s Jonas... In the O-Level...
speaker_heading: JONAS (V.O - RADIO)
dialog: Twenty seconds...
scene_heading: INT. MANA-ONE - THE O-LEVEL - CONTINUED
text: Jonas has struck the two flares and he’s waving them in his

speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: Come on... Come on...
text: The MEG turns -- and comes straight towards him. JONAS holds
text: his ground... And holds it... And holds it... Then--
speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: Ten seconds. Go!
text: Jonas tosses the flares so that they will land close to the
text: backpack. As they arc high in the air, he turns and sprints
text: FOR THE ELEVATOR...
dialog: 113.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
text: The ZODIAC puts some distance between itself and the station.
speaker_heading: JONAS (RADIO)

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - SAME

speaker_heading: JONAS (MIC)
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: ...Three... two...

scene_heading: THE ELEVATOR - BRINGING EVERYTHING TO A GRINDING HALT.

scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - ZODIAC - SAME
text: The passengers see the station power down. Grim reality sets

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - SAME
text: For a moment Jonas just sits there in the darkness. Then he
text: sees something. Gum. He stakes a stick as he finishes the
dialog: countdown--
speaker_heading: JONAS
dialog: --One.
scene_heading: INT. MANA-ONE - THE O-LEVEL - SAME
text: SMASH. The glass of the center spoke gives way to the power
text: of the MEG. And the MEG plows right into the backpack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAM!
text: An explosive force of more than a 1000 sticks of dynamite is
dialog: released.
scene_heading: FROM SEVERAL ANGLES - INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
text: The MEG dies in three stages that play out in less than
text: 1/100th of a second. First, the BLAST WAVE liquefies the
text: cartilage that makes up its body, essentially turning into a
text: giant shark-suited goo. Then, the HEAT super cooks the skin
text: into a black charcoal. Finally, the glass shards pierce the
text: carcass, VAPORIZING it into a cloud of tissue and blood that
dialog: leaves no mistake - THE MEG IS NO MORE.
dialog: 114.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - SAME
text: The explosion, moving faster than sound, hits the elevator
text: BEFORE the sound does. So for a dizzying moment, the
text: elevator is rocketed skyward, a bullet in a silent barrel.
text: THEN COMES THE DEAFENING ROAR
text: A JET OF FIRE - shoots through the seams of the rapidly
text: rising rocket lift. Suddenly Jonas thinks it’s walls are
text: made of flame. Then FLAMES obscure our view of him.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUED
text: From the Zodiac, the Mana-One looks like a volcano. JETS OF
text: FIRE erupt randomly from the station, followed by a DEAFENING
text: BLAST that causes the team to duck and cover.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUED
text: Still shooting towards the surface, flames swirling. Then,
text: when the pressure has reached its crescendo, THE ELEVATOR
text: ITSELF DISINTEGRATES, and, like a cocoon that’s revealed its
text: cargo, it releases Jonas into the OCEAN.
text: Floating in and out of consciousness, rising towards the
text: light, the last thing JONAS sees is a hazy image of THE BABY
text: HUMPBACK WHALE. It’s safe. Then he passes out and we...
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN - DAY
text: The Zodiac navigates the seas around what’s left of the Mana-
text: One. They’ve been searching for ten minutes with no sign.
text: Expressions are grave.
text: It’s Suyin who sees him.
speaker_heading: SUYIN
dialog: There!
text: JONAS is lying, half in the water, half clinging to a
text: floating remnant of the Mana-One. But he’s not moving. The
text: crew agonizes, waiting for a sign... They get it when Jonas,
text: without raising his head, lifts a weary arm skyward and gives
text: them a THUMBS UP.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OUTDOOR PLAZA - DIVE CENTER AT TIANJIN - DAY
text: A reverent crowd sits, listening to the end of a MEMORIAL
text: SERVICE/CELEBRATION OF LIFE. SUYIN stands at a dais, in
