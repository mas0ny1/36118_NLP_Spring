dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (V.O.)
dialog: I have a theory about how this all
dialog: started...
dialog: 
text: A SIX YEAR OLD BOY approaches. He watches the little
text: girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle.
dialog: 
text: And then - out of nowhere - THE LITTLE BOY PUSHES THE
text: LITTLE GIRL DOWN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Why did you do that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: Because you smell like dog poo.
dialog: 
text: Some of the other kids SNICKER at this brilliant one-

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're so stupid just like dog poo!
dialog: You're made of poo!
dialog: 
text: And then, just to punctuate, he JUMPS ON THE SANDCASTLE,

scene_heading: BACK TO THE SCENE - THE MOM CONTINUES...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: That little boy is doing those terrible

dialog: 
text: We see our little girl take this in, like she is just now
dialog: beginning to understand the ways of the world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (V.O.)
dialog: Do you understand what this means? We
dialog: are all encouraged to believe that if a

speaker_heading: ANNA

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Right.

dialog: times. Or at least until his mother
text: shouts at me in Albanian and blows a

dialog: So, this was at the end of the date, or
dialog: at the beginning?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: End. Why - does it matter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning
dialog: of the date is normal. "Nice meeting
dialog: you" at the end could be a blow off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Maybe it was at the beginning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Then that's fine. He's gonna call.

speaker_heading: GIGI

speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Wait - was it "nice meeting you" or "nice
dialog: to meet you"?
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Shit. I can't remember.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: "Nice to meet you" is OK. "Nice meeting

dialog: Maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration -
dialog: but otherwise good.
dialog: (to Gigi)
dialog: Where are we with the company newsletter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I am so almost done with that. It's just
dialog: been a little hard to focus on my article

speaker_heading: GIGI

speaker_heading: GIGI

speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Your notes.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI

dialog: Hey, Conor. It's Gigi. I just thought,

dialog: stupid is it that a gal has got to wait
dialog: for a guy's call anyway, right?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: (clearly ad-libbing)
dialog: I mean, we're all equal, right? More

scene_heading: INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - LATER
dialog: 
text: Gigi stares at the PHONE. Then she feigns disinterest in

text: the receiver to listen for a dial tone. And PANICS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: WHAT? How can there be no dial tone?
dialog: 
text: She frantically jiggles the cord, then hears something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom? Is that you? I can't talk now.
dialog: I'll call you back.
dialog: 
text: She hangs up, stares at the phone again. A look of
text: DETERMINATION crosses her face. She dials.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: Janine. It's me. Conor never called, so
dialog: I'm on the precipice of staging a casual

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLI ANN
dialog: So. Here we are. Same shift again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I know. I make the schedule.

speaker_heading: KELLI ANN
speaker_heading: (FLIRTING)

speaker_heading: ALEX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLI ANN
dialog: Anyway - I was thinking, maybe tonight
dialog: after work...we could, you know...
dialog: 
text: Alex stops what he's doing, looks up at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between
dialog: us the other night was - fun. But we're
dialog: way understaffed tonight - I even have to
dialog: man the bar - and that's why I scheduled
dialog: you. To work. So...
dialog: 
text: He goes back to work. Kelli Ann stands there, frozen.
text: Alex can feel her eyes on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Are we good here?
dialog: 
text: Kelli Ann's face goes flush. She tries to hide it. She
text: backs up, puts on a smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLI ANN
dialog: No. We're good.
dialog: 
text: She leaves. Alex exhales, goes back to work.

dialog:

scene_heading: ACCIDENTALLY (ON PURPOSE) SHOULDER BLOCKS ALEX. HARD.
text: He has to take a step to catch his balance.
dialog: 
text: He turns around to see what happened, but Kelli Ann keeps

speaker_heading: TYRONE

speaker_heading: ALEX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLI ANN
dialog: Are you joining us for dinner or -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I'm meeting someone. A guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLI ANN
dialog: Ugh. Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Hmmmm?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLI ANN
dialog: Nothing. Sorry. For dinner?
dialog: 
text: Gigi continues to scan the place, not paying attention.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I'm meeting someone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLI ANN
dialog: I believe you mentioned that.
dialog: 
text: Gigi finishes her visual tour of the room - no Conor.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I'm gonna wait at the bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLI ANN
dialog: That's a great idea.
dialog: 
text: Gigi walks off. Kelli Ann takes her place behind the
dialog: hostess stand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AT THE BAR
dialog: 
text: Gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door. Alex,
text: now behind the bar, approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What can I get you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Oh, that's OK. I'm meeting someone.
dialog: 
text: Alex takes her in. She's clearly nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Oh, yeah? Got a hot date?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I don't know if you'd call it hot -- I
dialog: mean this guy Conor and I have only been
dialog: out the one time so --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Wait - Conor Barry?
dialog: 
text: Gigi is busted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Oh, uhh, yeah --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Conor's not coming in tonight. Did he
dialog: forget he was supposed to meet you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: See when I said "meeting someone" I guess
dialog: that was kind of a broad term, kind of a
dialog: wide interpretation of the word "meeting"-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Because I could just call him --
dialog: 
text: Alex reaches for the phone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21
dialog: 
dialog: 7/20/7 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: NO! I mean, totally unnecessary. I
dialog: mean, I actually was just - in the area -
dialog: so I figured I'd just swing by and see if
dialog: he was around - because - uhhh ---
dialog: 
text: Alex waits, looking at Gigi, amused. She is panicking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: I uhh, had to return his --
dialog: 
text: Gigi frantically searches her coat pockets - searching
text: for something, anything - and finally fishes out A PEN.
text: She looks at it - and decides to go with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: Pen. I had to return this - pen. He
dialog: left this. So, I thought I should really
dialog: return it before he - you know -
dialog: (conspiratorially to Alex)
text: -- freaks out.
dialog: 
text: Alex looks at her skeptically. And then takes the PEN,
text: and inspects it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Dr. Frankel - Adult, Child and Geriatric
dialog: Dentistry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Look, I'm not gonna judge about what may
dialog: or may not be important to someone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: That's not even his dentist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Oh, really? Then who's his dentist?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: My dad.
dialog: 
text: Gigi looks at Alex for a long moment, and finally folds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I'm Gigi. Conor and I went out last
dialog: week. And I just...I thought if I ran
dialog: into him...I don't know. I'm gonna go.
dialog: 
text: Gigi struggles to get out quickly. Alex looks at her -
text: holding her pen, looking quite frazzled - and softens.

dialog: 
dialog: 7/20/7 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX

dialog: Lemme buy you a drink.
dialog: 
text: Gigi SMILES and sits back down.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RED MAPLE - NIGHT

text: receipts - and Gigi is still nursing a drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm
dialog: just gonna be honest - Conor is never
dialog: going to call you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Oh really? How do you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Because I'm a guy. It's how we do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
speaker_heading: (HOPEFUL)
dialog: He said it was nice meeting me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't care if he said you were his
dialog: favorite female since his mommy and
dialog: Joanie Cunningham. Over a week went by -
dialog: and he didn't call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: But maybe he called me and I didn't get
dialog: the message. Or maybe he lost my number,
text: or was out of town, or was hit by a cab,
dialog: or his grandma died.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Or maybe he just didn't call because he
dialog: has no interest in seeing you again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Yeah but my friend Terri once went out
dialog: with this guy who never called and she
dialog: totally wrote him off - then like a year
dialog: later she ran into him --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Your friend Terri's an idiot. And she's
dialog: the exception.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23
dialog: 
dialog: 7/20/7 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: OK. But what if I'm the exception?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You're not. You're the rule. And the
dialog: rule is - if a guy doesn't call you, he
dialog: doesn't want to call you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Really? Always?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Yeah. Always. I know what blowing off a
dialog: woman looks like. I do it early and I do
dialog: it often. Trust me - if a guy is
dialog: treating you like he doesn't give a shit -
dialog: - he doesn't. No exceptions.
dialog: 
text: Gigi thinks this over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Why are you telling me all of this?
dialog: Aren't these man-secrets - like why men
dialog: need to watch televised golf?
dialog:

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I don't know. You looked like you could

scene_heading: INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORP. HQ - BETH'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Gigi paces in front of Beth's desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I think I figured it out. Remember when
dialog: I went out with that notary public? And
dialog: he cheated on me? And then Anastasia
dialog: from upstairs told us that story about
dialog: how her boyfriend cheated on her at the
dialog: beginning - but then he totally changed
text: and they're married and crazy in love.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I thought that guy was a process server.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: No, notary. Anyway, the point is -
dialog: Anastasia is the exception. Not the
dialog: rule. We have to stop listening to these
dialog: stories - because the rule is that most
dialog: guys who cheat on you up front don't
dialog: really care about you very much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Okay...
dialog: 
text: Gigi consults her crumpled pieces of paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Exhibit A: Chad, the drummer who lived
dialog: in his storage space. He only used me
dialog: for rides, yet I continued to stalk him
dialog: for most of 1998. Then there was Don,
dialog: who broke up with me every Friday so he
dialog: could have his weekends free. I was so
dialog: delusional about our relationship that I
dialog: referred to him as my husband to random
dialog: people like my dental hygenist.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: And all my friends would tell me stories
dialog: about how things might work out with
dialog: these dipshits because they knew someone
dialog: who knew someone who dated a dipshit just
dialog: like mine, and that girl ended up getting
text: married and living happily ever after.
dialog: But that's the exception. And we're not
dialog: the exception - we're the rule.
dialog: 
text: Gigi sits down, spent. But Beth has been listening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: OK. So let me see if I understand. What
dialog: you're saying is that when people tell me
dialog: about some girl they know who dated a guy
dialog: for thirteen years, and then he finally
dialog: married her -- that's the exception. And
dialog: the rule is that guys - like Neil - who
dialog: are with girls - like me - for seven
dialog: years without getting married - are never
dialog: getting married.
dialog: 
text: Beth is serious. Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: No. No, no, no. That's not what I'm
dialog: saying. This has absolutely nothing to
dialog: do with you. I was just talking, you

speaker_heading: CONOR

dialog: gleaned from my own experience, of

dialog: if: she calls you cuddly or dependable,

speaker_heading: ALEX

dialog: Guys invented the "spark" so they could

dialog: that the anxiety and fear that it creates
dialog: in you is actually a "spark." And you
dialog: all buy it. You love it. You all thrive

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Really? So you don't wait until the last

speaker_heading: GIGI

speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And let me guess - when you were stalking

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: OK. Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX

speaker_heading: JANINE

speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: I just - I have no idea what she's doing.
dialog: I cannot read her signals - at all. We

dialog: Well, that's not true, I don't know why I
dialog: said that, it wasn't all the time. But
dialog: it did happen - I know I'm not making
text: this up. And then, out of nowhere, it
text: stops. But she still calls, she stops

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: It's that simple.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONOR
dialog: You're right. That's no help at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: But listen - I can tell you this. Gay or
dialog: straight, you're not going to get
dialog: anywhere by being inactive. She clearly
dialog: likes you - maybe she just wants you to
dialog: be a man and do something. So the next
dialog: time you're in the position - don't take
dialog: no for an answer.
dialog: 
text: Skip looks at Larry, concerned.

dialog: I guess Conor at first. Now men in
dialog: general. But that's not the point. The
dialog: point is -- he's into me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: You know, I knew there had to be a reason
dialog: he was spending all that time with you.

dialog: I know! It's so obvious now -- there are
dialog: so many signs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Oooh, gimme the signs. I love to hear
dialog: about the signs.
dialog: 
text: Janine rolls her chair closer to Gigi's desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: At first they were small - like when I
dialog: first called he said "Good to hear from
dialog: you" -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Totally good sign.
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Right? And then the next time I called
text: he was with a woman - but he still took
dialog: the call. And talked to me for a while.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: You know it was a woman?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: He called her "babe."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
text: A guy does not leave a woman - to talk to
dialog: another woman - unless there's something
text: going on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I know! And it gets more obvious. I
dialog: mean, please - there was no guy he was
dialog: going to fix me up with. The fix up was
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: Wait - really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: He shows up - without this fictitious
dialog: Bill character - and the two of us
dialog: basically have a date. And then he calls
dialog: me to invite me to a party at his place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: You're right. He so likes you.

speaker_heading: NATHAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: That one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No. That's the laminate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: That one isn't real hardwood floor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
text: No. But it looks exactly the same - at

dialog: 
dialog: Janine considers this.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 75
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: I still wanna go with the real wood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: But you can't even tell the difference.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: That's not the point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Then what's the point?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: I just don't like the way it's pretending
dialog: to be wood. If you're not wood, then
dialog: don't try to look like wood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I don't think it's pretending --
dialog: 
text: Ben is making light. But Janine is all business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: It's a lie. Just be up front - tell
dialog: people what you really are.
dialog: 
text: Ben takes this in. His cheeks start to burn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You're right. I'm sorry. You're totally
dialog: right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: It's OK. Maybe we should look at the

dialog: 
text: As she starts to steer their giant cart away, Ben just

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I slept with someone.

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You tell me this in Home Depot because

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That is not why I -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANINE
dialog: I knew it. I KNEW IT. You asshole.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: JANINE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (almost a whisper)
dialog: No.

dialog: 
text: Then Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with
text: her husband, STEVEN. Beth's sister Catherine and her
text: husband GEORGE are next. Big smiles all around.
dialog: 
text: Then Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: It makes your breath stink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Pardon?

text: night gay mode - standing next to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Chex Mix. I learned the hard way. I
text: made out with a guy after eating like a
dialog: bag of the stuff. He said my breath
dialog: smelled like trout.
dialog: 
text: Gigi puts her handful of Chex Mix back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Thanks for the tip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I'm sorry. That was rude. And that guy

text: Gigi LAUGHS.

speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Thanks. I'm good.
dialog: 
text: She cups her hand and surreptitiously checks her breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I'm Nathan. This is Bruce.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Gigi. How do you guys know Alex?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: We don't. Our friend Mary heard about it
dialog: from some guy named Conor.
dialog: 
text: Gigi smiles in recognition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: How do you know Alex?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I hope - I mean I'm pretty sure -
dialog: something is about to happen between us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: So, you're here as like a guest, or like
dialog: his date?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I hate that - when you don't know if
dialog: you're a date - so you don't know if you
dialog: should bring a friend, or if you're like
dialog: co-hosting or if you should stay til the
dialog: end to have alone time --
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a look of DOUBT sweeps across Gigi's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: He didn't really say.
dialog: 
text: She reflexively GRABS FOR THE CHEX MIX and starts gorging
text: on it again. Nathan stops her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: But I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.
dialog: I mean - there have been signs.

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: DOMINIC

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Eeew Dominic, gross.
dialog: 
text: Beth swats Dominic on the arm, and he laughs. And then
text: they are distracted by a COMMOTION ON THE DANCE FLOOR.
dialog: 
text: Everyone has stopped dancing. They are looking to the

text: Gigi turns to him and smiles.

speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Hey. Great party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Are any guys hitting on you? Do you need
dialog: me to evaluate their level of interest?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: They were gay. Even I know that their
dialog: level of interest was probably low.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Well - too bad Bill couldn't make it. I
dialog: still think you guys would hit it off.
dialog: 
text: Gigi smiles knowingly - on to Alex's scam.

speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Oh OK. Right.
dialog: (air quotes)
dialog: "Bill".
dialog: 
text: Alex doesn't know how to take that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Anyway - I'm on my way to put out some
dialog: more liquor. But it looks like the food
dialog: could use some refreshing --
dialog: 
text: He looks at the FOOD TABLE. Everything is empty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you mind helping? I mean, just
dialog: refill the chips and stuff?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI

dialog: 
text: He walks away. Gigi smiles BIG.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: The party is now even more crowded. Gigi weaves her way
text: through the crowd. She's deftly holding SIX DRINKS,
text: passing them off to various people as she walks.
dialog: 
text: She stops at the food table, rearranges a few bowls.
dialog: 
text: She CATCHES ALEX'S EYE across the room, he's talking to
text: friends. She smiles and gives a THUMBS UP. He gives an
text: awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: Gigi is in the kitchen, mixing up some DIP. She chats
text: with a couple of PARTY-GOERS, very much at home.
dialog: 
scene_heading: PARTY-GOER #1
dialog: Really great party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Thanks. When Alex said he wanted to have

dialog: 
scene_heading: PARTY-GOER #2
dialog: Thanks so much for having us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: No problem. Anytime.
dialog:

text: LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS. Gigi watches with interest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I help you find something?
dialog: 
text: The Tall Girl finds a BOWL in the cabinet, and grabs it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL GIRL
dialog: No, that's OK. I got it.
dialog: 
text: She brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts
text: emptying Gigi's dip into the bowl. Gigi is THROWN.

speaker_heading: TALL GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for mixing that up.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 83
dialog: 
dialog: 7/20/7 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL GIRL
dialog: Alex asked me to get the dip together.
dialog: Thanks for getting it started.
dialog: 
text: Gigi's face grows red. The Tall Girl tastes the dip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hmmm - could use a little more dill.
dialog: 
text: Then the Tall Girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and
text: heads back out to the party. Gigi looks to the confused
text: party-goers, not pleased.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - LATER
dialog: 
text: Bruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave. People are
text: getting coats - the crowd is definitely thinning.
dialog: 
text: Gigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: When someone's underwear ends up in your
dialog: toaster oven - it's been a good party.
dialog: 
text: Alex looks at the toaster oven and laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: I guess people had fun.
dialog: 
text: Then, the TALL GIRL emerges.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL GIRL
dialog: Alex, you want me to start cleaning up?
dialog: 
text: Gigi STARES DAGGERS AT HER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: That's sweet of you. But I thought I'd
dialog: stick around, so I'll take care of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL GIRL
dialog: No. I got it.
dialog: 
text: The tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a
text: trash bag. Gigi grabs one, too. Alex looks mystified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Knock yourselves out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - STILL LATER
dialog: 
text: It is really late. Everyone's gone - except the TALL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I think I've rounded up the last of the
dialog: beer bottles.
dialog: 
text: The tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game.
text: Gigi stands there awkwardly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: So, umm - what game is this?
dialog: 
text: They ignore her. She looks around. It's awkward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, maybe I should just -- you know --
dialog: I mean it's past three and --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL GIRL
dialog: YES!! Suck it!
dialog: 
text: Alex tosses down his controller.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: You are sensational.
dialog: 
text: The tall girl beams. Gigi flinches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TALL GIRL
dialog: Did you say it's past three? Man, I
dialog: gotta go.
dialog: 
text: Gigi suppresses a SMILE. The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug,
text: and heads out. Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next
text: to him on the couch. They're silent for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Thanks for staying and helping clean up
dialog: - but I really gotta get to bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Is that an invitation?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I'm sorry. That was cheesy. I'm not
dialog: good at this.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85
dialog: 
dialog: 7/20/7 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: But then -- before Alex knows what's happening, Gigi is
text: LUNGING at him. She puts his face in her hands, and
text: starts to KISS HIM. REALLY KISS HIM. Finally, Gigi
text: pulls away. She looks breathless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes!
dialog: 
text: Alex looks a little afraid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew it. I knew it. The best
dialog: relationships grow out of friendships.
dialog: 
text: She goes in to kiss him again. This time he stops her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Wait - what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Ummmm....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Now you and I are in a relationship?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Well, I'd say if we're not at
dialog: relationship station--ship, we're at
text: least on the track.
dialog: 
text: Alex gets up off the couch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: And why would you think that, exactly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Because there were - you know - signs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Really? Like what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Ummm - it was good to hear from me. You
dialog: talked to me even when you were with a
dialog: girl. I felt something...
dialog: 
text: She trails off. Alex is not pleased.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: What are you talking about? What have I
dialog: been saying since I met you? If a guy
dialog: wants to date you HE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.
text: HE WILL ASK YOU OUT. DID I ASK YOU OUT?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86
dialog: 
dialog: 7/20/7 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Why would you do this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I thought you were Watts.

dialog: - some intrigue, some mind games - though
dialog: my sister's two year old eventually gave

text: never found a single shred of evidence.
dialog: It wasn't until he died that I found out

speaker_heading: CONOR (CONT'D)

dialog: Nice and tasteful.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Without even thinking she grabs it from the wall and

dialog: 
dialog: A staple of summer in Baltimore.
dialog: 
text: The rickety Baltimore Blade float comes by. It's a very

speaker_heading: GIGI (V.O.)

dialog: love...
dialog: 
text: Mary hits a button and a box comes up, which reads: ARE

dialog: 
text: He lets her go ahead of him. She smiles, takes him up on

scene_heading: EXT. BUTCHER'S HILL BROWNSTONE - EVENING
dialog: 
text: From the outside looking in a ground floor window - we

dialog: 
text: Janine enters, carrying two boxes. She opens one, and
text: pulls out the ANTIQUE MIRROR (now with new glass).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (V.O.)
dialog: And ultimately, we're not taught the one
dialog: thing that could save ourselves, our
dialog: friends, our families countless hours of
text: confusion, despair, and speculation.
dialog: 
text: She hangs the mirror, straightening it slightly. She
text: steps back, seems pleased. Then, IN FRONT OF CAMERA walk
text: two people - the CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM down the sidewalk.
dialog: 
text: We see it's Anna, walking with a NEW GUY - it's clear
text: it's a first date. They stop at the corner, exchange an
text: awkward hug. As they turn to go their separate ways -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEW GUY
dialog: It was nice meeting you.
dialog: 
text: Anna smiles - the New Guy turns and heads off. Anna
text: watches him go, and then turns and walks away from us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIGI (V.O.)
