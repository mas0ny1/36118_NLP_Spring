speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: People were always asking me, did I
dialog: know Tyler Durden.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT
text: TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand
text: holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.
text: Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.
text: They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler
text: is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a
text: dry sort of way. Tyler looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: One minute.
dialog: (looking out window)
dialog: This is the beginning. We're at
dialog: ground zero. Maybe you should say a
dialog: few words, to mark the occasion.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: With a gun barrel between your teeth,
dialog: you only speak in vowels.
text: Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (still distorted)
dialog: I can't think of anything.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: With my tongue, I can feel the
text: rifling in the barrel. For a second,
dialog: I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
dialog: controlled demolition thing and I
dialog: wondered how clean this gun is.
text: Tyler checks his watch.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: It's getting exciting now.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: That old saying, how you always hurt
dialog: the one you love, well, it works both
dialog: way.
text: Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: We have front row seats for this
dialog: Theater of Mass Destruction. The
dialog: Demolitions Committee of Project
dialog: Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
dialog: of ten buildings with blasting
dialog: gelatin. In two minutes, primary
dialog: charges will blow base charges, and
dialog: those buildings will be reduced to
dialog: smoldering rubble. I know this
dialog: because Tyler knows this.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Look what we've accomplised.
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: Thirty seconds.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Somehow, I realize all of this -- the
dialog: gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is
dialog: really about Marla Singer.
text: PULL BACK from Jack's face. It's pressed against TWO LARGE
text: BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man. Jack is
text: engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace. Bob weeps openly.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Bob had bitch tits.
text: PULL BACK to wide on...
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.
text: Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: This was a support group for men with
dialog: testicular cancer. The big moosie
dialog: slobbering all over me was Bob.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: We're still men.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes. We're men. Men is what we are.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Six months ago, Bob's testicles were
dialog: removed. Then hormone therapy. He
dialog: developed bitch tits because his
dialog: testosterone was too high and his
dialog: body upped the estrogen. That was
dialog: where my head fit -- into his huge,
dialog: sweating tits that hung enormous, the
dialog: way we think of God's as big.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: They're gonna have to open my pec's
dialog: again to drain the fluid.
text: Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Okay. You cry now.
text: Jack looks at Bob.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. COPY ROOM - DAY
text: Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine. His Starbucks cup
text: sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
text: With insomnia, nothing is real.
dialog: Everything is far away. Everything
text: is a copy of a copy of a copy.
text: Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.
text: Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME
text: Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the
text: floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: When deep space exploration ramps up,

dialog: The Philip Morris Galaxy. Planet
dialog: Starbucks.
text: Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks
text: cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: I'm going to need you out-of-town a
dialog: little more this week. We've got
dialog: some "red-flags" to cover.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: It must've been Tuesday. he was
dialog: wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (listless management speak)
dialog: You want me to de-prioritize my
dialog: current reports until you advise of
dialog: a status upgrade?
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: You need to make these your primary
dialog: "action items."
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: He was full of pep. Must've had his
dialog: grande latte enema.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: Here are your flight coupons. Call
dialog: me from the road if there are any
dialog: snags. Your itinerary...
text: Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT
text: Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips
text: through an IKEA catalog. There's a stack of old Playboy
text: magazines and other catalogs nearby.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Like everyone else, I had become a
dialog: slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes. I'd like to order the Erika
dialog: Pekkari slip covers.
text: Jack drops the open catalog on the floor.
scene_heading: MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: If I saw something like clever coffee
dialog: table sin the shape of a yin and
dialog: yang, I had to have it.
text: PAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Like the Johanneshov armchair in the
dialog: Strinne green stripe pattern...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHEN
text: The armchair APPEARS. PAN OVER next to armchair...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Or the Rislampa wire lamps of
dialog: environmentally-friendly unbleached
dialog: paper.
text: The lamps APPEAR. PAN OVER to wall...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Even the Vild hall clock of
text: galvanized steel, resting on the
dialog: Klipsk shelving unit.
text: The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I would flip through catalogs and
dialog: wonder, "What kind of dining set
dialog: defines me as a person?" We used to
dialog: read pornography. Now it was the
dialog: Horchow Collection.
text: A dining room set APPEARS. Jack, the cordless phone still
text: glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, I don't want Cobalt. Oh, that
dialog: sounds nice. Apricot.
text: Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I had it all. Even the glass dishes
text: with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
dialog: proof they were crafted by the
dialog: honest, simple, hard-working
dialog: indigenous peoples of wherever.
text: He rummages through the refrigerator. It's practically
text: empty. Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses
text: a butter knife to eat it.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who
text: studies him with bemusement.
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: No, you can't die of insomnia.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe I died already. Look at my
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: You need to lighten up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Can't you give me something?
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red
dialog: Seconals.
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: (overlapping w/ above)
dialog: You need healthy, natural sleep.
dialog: Chew valerian root and get some more
dialog: exercise.
text: The Intern ushes Jack to the door. They step into the...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: The Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm in pain.
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: (facetious)
dialog: You want to see pain? Swing by First
dialog: Methodist Tuesday nights. See the

dialog: pain.

scene_heading: EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT
text: Jack heads for the front door.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all
text: listening to a group member speak at a lectern. The SPEAKER
text: has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: I... wanted three kids. Two boys and
dialog: a girl. Mindy wanted two girls and
dialog: one boy. We never could agree on
dialog: anything.
text: The Speaker cracks a sad smile. Some men chuckle, happy to
dialog: lighten the mood.
speaker_heading: SPEAKER
dialog: Well, she had her first child a month
text: ago, a girl, with her new husband...
dialog: And, Thank God. I'm glad for her,
dialog: because she deserves...
text: The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.
text: Jack watches. A couple of the men go up to the speaker,
text: comforting him, leading him away. A LEADER takes the stand.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Everyone, let's thank Thomas for
dialog: sharing himself with us.
text: Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: Thank you, Thomas.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: I look around this room and I see a
dialog: lot of courage. And it gives me
dialog: strength. We give each other
dialog: strength.
text: Jack looks around. Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.
text: Jack squirms in his seat.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: It's time for the one-on-one. Let's
dialog: follow Thomas's example and open
dialog: ourselves.
text: Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.
text: Jack stands, uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Can everyone find a partner?
text: Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack,
text: shuffling his feet.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
text: The big moosie, his eyes already
text: shrink-wrapped in tears. Knees
text: together, invisible steps.
text: Bob takes Jack into an embrace.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Bob was a champion bodybuilder. You
dialog: know that chest expansion program you
dialog: see on TV? That was his idea.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: ...using steroids. I was a juicer.
dialog: Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for
dialog: racehorses, for Christsake. Now I'm
dialog: bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids
dialog: won't return my calls...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Strangers with this kind of honesty
dialog: make me go a big rubbery one.
text: Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder
text: and completely covering Jack's face. After a long beat of
text: crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Go ahead, Cornelius. You can cry.
text: They look at each other. Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Then... something happened. I was
text: lost in oblivion -- dark and silent
dialog: and complete.
text: Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest. Jack tightens
text: his arms around Bob.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I found freedom. Losing all hope was
dialog: freedom.
text: Jack pulls away from Bob. On Bob's chest, there's a WET
text: MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Babies don't sleep this well.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

text: women. In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear."
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN. He begins to
text: cry along with her. A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward."
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: If I didn't say anything, people
dialog: assumed the worst. They cried
dialog: harder. I cried harder.
scene_heading: INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES
text: CLOSED. The Leader speaks into a microphone.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Tonight, we're going to open the
dialog: green door -- the heart chakra...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host
dialog: to cancer or parasites; I was the
dialog: warm little center that the life of
dialog: this world crowded around.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: ...And you open the door and you
dialog: step inside. We're inside our
dialog: hearts. Now, imaging your pain as a
dialog: white ball of healing light. That's
dialog: right, the pain itself is a ball of
dialog: healing light.
text: Jack, eyes closed, is silent...
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: It moves over your body, healing you.
dialog: Keep this going and step forward,
text: through the back door of the room.
dialog: Where does it lead? To your cave.
dialog: Step forward into your cave.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION
text: Jack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN...
speaker_heading: LEADER'S VOICE
dialog: That's right. You're going deeper
dialog: into your cave. And you're going to
dialog: find your power animal...
text: Jack comes upon a PENGUIN. The penguin looks at him, cocks
text: his head to signal Jack forward.
speaker_heading: PENGUIN
dialog: Slide.
text: The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people. He
text: walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Every evening I died and every
dialog: evening I was born again. Resurrected.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMING
text: Jack's still in an embrace with Bob.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Bob loved me because he thought my
dialog: testicles were removed too. Being
dialog: there, my face against his tits,
dialog: ready to cry -- this was my vacation.
text: MARLA SINGER enters. She has short matte black hair and
text: big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: And, she ruined everything.
text: Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: This is cancer, right?
text: Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATER
text: Everyone paired-off. MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE
text: as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE.
text: She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: This ... chick ... Marla Singer ...
dialog: did not have testicular cancer. She
dialog: was a liar.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT
text: Marla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while
text: a member speaks. Jack spies on her.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: She had no diseases at all. I had
dialog: seen her at my melanoma Monday night
dialog: group ...
scene_heading: INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
text: Marla sits at the end of a row, smoking. All the faces down
text: the row are turned toward her, incredulous...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: ... and at "Free and Clear," my blood
dialog: parasites group Thursdays.
text: Jack leans out further than the others, scornful.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: -- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my
dialog: tuberculosis Friday night.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
text: Jack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the
text: shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by. She opens her eyes,
text: catching Jack's stare. Jack looks away.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Marla -- the big tourist. Her lie
dialog: reflected my lie.
text: Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder. Tears roll down
text: her cheeks. She wipes at them.
scene_heading: EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT
text: Marla walks out, The support group's dispersing. Jack
text: exits amongst them. He spots Marla walking away.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: And suddenly, I felt nothing. I
dialog: couldn't cry. So, once again, I
dialog: could not sleep.
text: Jack stares after Marla for a long moment. He walks away.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
text: Jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling
text: IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: No, I just can't believe that card is
dialog: declined -- Okay, okay, let me give
dialog: you a different card number.
text: Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card
text: and, MOS over the following, he reads it into the phone.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Next group, after guided meditation,
dialog: after we open our chakras, when it's
dialog: time to hug, I'm going to grab that
dialog: little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her
text: arms against her sides and say...
scene_heading: INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - JACK'S IMAGINATION
text: CLOSE ON JACK as he CLAMPS his arms around Marla.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Marla, you liar, you big tourist. I
dialog: need this. Get out.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack, in pajamas, stares at Home Shopping Network on his TV.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: When you have insomnia, you're never
dialog: really asleep and you're never really
dialog: awake. I hadn't slept in four days...
scene_heading: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT
text: Jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around. People
text: are chattering with each other.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: -- But, in here, in everyone, there's
text: the squint of a five-day headache.
dialog: Yet they forced themselves to be
dialog: positive. They never said
dialog: "parasite;" they said "agent." They
dialog: always talked about getting better.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Okay, everyone.
text: Everyone sits in chairs. Jack catches sight of Marla.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: To open tonight's communion, Chloe
dialog: would like to say a few words.
text: Taking the lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin
text: stretches yellowish and tight over her bones. She wears a
text: head bondage. She clears her throat.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Ahh, Chloe. Chloe looked the way
dialog: Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look
dialog: if you made it smile and walk around
dialog: a party being extra nice to everyone.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Well, I'm still here -- but I don't
dialog: know for how long. That's as much
dialog: certainty as anyone can give me. but
dialog: I've got some good news -- I no
dialog: longer have any fear of death.
text: APPLAUSE from around the room.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
dialog: No one will have sex with me. I'm so
dialog: close to the end and all I want is to
dialog: get laid for the last time. I have
dialog: pornographic movies in my apartment,
dialog: and lubricants and amyl nitrate ...
text: The LEADER gingerly takes control of the microphone.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Thank you, Chloe. Everyone, let's
dialog: thank Chloe.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Thank you, Chloe.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Now, you're standing at the entrance
dialog: to your cave. You step inside your
dialog: cave and you walk. Keep walking.
text: Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: If I did have a tumor, I'd name it
dialog: Marla. Marla...the little scratch on
dialog: the roof of your mouth that would
dialog: heal if only you could stop tonguing
dialog: it, but you can't.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Now, find your power animal.
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION
text: Jack finds Marla smoking a cigarette. Marla cocks her head,

speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Slide.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - RESUMING
text: Jack's eyes open and turn to Marla, watching her blow smoke
text: rings with her eyes closed.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER
text: Everyone stands and mills about, pairing-off.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Pick someone special to you tonight.
text: Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe ambling towards him.
text: He tries to smile. She smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Hello, Mr. Tayler.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I never gave my real name at support
dialog: groups.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hi, Chloe.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: We've never actually talked.
text: Chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation. Jack, in
text: a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You look good. You ... look ... like
dialog: a pirate.
text: Chloe laughs, a little too much. Jack squeezes out a laugh.
text: Then he sees Marla, off by herself. Someone heads for her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Excuse me, I have to...
text: Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts towards Marla.
text: Chloe watches him go.
text: STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as Jack CLAMPS his arms around her.
text: He whispers into her ear.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We need to talk.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm on to you. You're a faker. You
dialog: aren't dying.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy
dialog: way, we're all dying. But you're not
text: dying the way Chloe is dying.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Tell the other person how you feel.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're a tourist. I saw you at
dialog: melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular
dialog: cancer.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: And I saw you practicing this...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Practicing what?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Telling me off. Is it going as well
dialog: as you hoped... ?
dialog: (reads his nametag)
dialog: "... Mr. Taylor."
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll expose you.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Go ahead. I'll expose you.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Share yourself completely.
text: Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were
text: crying. Jack pulls her head back up. She deadpans at him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: It's cheaper than a movie, and
dialog: there's free coffee.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: These are my groups. I was here
dialog: first. I've been coming for a year.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: A year? How'd you manage that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Anyone who might've noticed either
dialog: died or recovered and never came back.
speaker_heading: LEADER
dialog: Let yourself cry.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Why do you do it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I... I don't know. I guess... when
dialog: people think you're dying, they
dialog: really listen, instead...
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: -- Instead of just waiting for their
dialog: turn to speak.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
text: Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes.
speaker_heading: LEADER
text: Quietly, now. Share with each other.
text: Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (warning)
text: It becomes an addiction.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Really?
text: Jack sighs, then pulls back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look, I can't cry with a faker
dialog: present.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not
dialog: my problem.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Please. Can't we do something... ?
text: Marla starts out of the room. Jack follows her.
speaker_heading: LEADER
text: Now, the closing prayer.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We'll split up the week. You can
dialog: have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: You take tuberculosis. My smoking
dialog: doesn't go over at all.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I think testicular cancer should be
dialog: no contest.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Well, technically, I have more of a
dialog: right to be there than you. You
dialog: still have your balls.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: I don't know -- am I?
dialog: Jack follow Marla into...
scene_heading: INT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS
text: Marla walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER. She
text: takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: I'll take the parasites.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You can't have both parasites. You
dialog: can take blood parasites --
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: I want brain parasites.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay. I'll take blood parasites and
dialog: organic brain dementia --
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: I want that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You can't have the whole brain!
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: So far, you have four and I only have
dialog: two!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Then, take blood parasites. It's
dialog: yours. Now we each have three.
text: Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack...
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack follows, bewildered.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You... left half your clothes.
text: HONK! Jack starts. Marla's led him into the street with

text: Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS
text: BLARING. Jack dashes, following...
scene_heading: INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS

dialog: You're selling those?
text: Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot. He winces in pain.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: (for the Clerk to hear)
dialog: Yes, I'm selling some chothes.
text: The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: So, we each have three -- that's six.
dialog: What about the seventh day? I want
dialog: ascending bowel cancer.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: The girl had done her homework.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I want ascending bowel cancer.
text: The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: That's your favorite, too? Tried to
dialog: slip it by me, eh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We'll split it. You get it the first
dialog: and third Sunday of the month.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Deal.
text: They shake. Jack tries to withdraw his hand; Marla holds it.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Looks like this is goodbye.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's not make a big thing out of it.
text: She walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: How's this for not making a big thing?
text: Jack watches her go. A moment, then he follows after...
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange
dialog: numbers?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Should we?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: In case we want to switch nights.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: I suppose.
text: Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the
text: back, hands it to her. She takes the pen, grabs his hand
text: and writes her number on his palm. She walks into the
text: street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING. She turns,
text: holds up the card.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: It doesn't have your name. Who are
dialog: you? Cornelius? Mr. Taylor? Dr.
dialog: Zaius? Any of the stupid names you
dialog: give each night?
text: Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud.
text: Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving. A BUS
text: moves into view, obscuring her.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: This is how I met Marla Singer.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY
text: The plane touches down; the cabin BUMPS. Jack's eyes open.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: You wake up at O'Hare.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY
text: Jack snaps awake again, looking around, disoriented.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: You wake up at SeaTac.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK
text: The rear of a CRASHED CAR sticks up by the side of the road.
text: Jack stands, marking on a clipboard. The SUN SETS behind.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: Jack stands at a gate counter. An ATTENDANT smiles at him.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Check-in for that flight doesn't
dialog: begin for another two hours, Sir.
text: Jack looks with blearing eyes at his watch, steps away and
text: looks at an overhanging CLOCK.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Pacific, Mountain, Central. Lose an
dialog: hour, gain an hour. This is your
dialog: life, and it's ending one minute at
dialog: a time.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY
text: Jack's eyes snap open as the plane LANDS.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: You wake up at Air Harbor
dialog: International.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT WALKWAY
text: Jack stands on a conveyor belt, briefcase at his feet. He
text: watches PEOPLE MOVING PAST on the opposite conveyor.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: If you wake up at a different time
dialog: and in a different place, could you
dialog: wake up as a different person?
text: Jack misses seeing TYLER on the opposite conveyor belt.
text: They pass each other.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT
text: Jack sits next to a BUSINESSMAN. As they have idle
text: CONVERSATION, we MOVE IN ON Jack's tray. An ATTENDANT'S
text: HANDS set coffee down with a small container of cream.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Everywhere I travel -- tiny life.
dialog: Single-serving sugar, single-serving
dialog: cream, single pat of butter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: HANDS place a dinner tray down.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack brushes his teeth in the MIRROR.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Shampoo/conditioner combo. Single-
text: serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap.
text: Jack picks up an individual, wrapped Q-TIP, looks at it. He
text: moves out of the bathroom into...
speaker_heading: MAIN ROOM
text: Jack sits on the bed. He turns on the TV. It's tuned to
text: the "Sheraton Channel," shows WAITERS serving people in a
text: large BANQUET ROOM. Jack stops brushing his teeth, feels
text: something on the bed, lifts it -- a small DINNER MINT.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT
text: Jack sits next to a frumpy WOMAN. They chat. Jack turns to
text: look at his food, takes a bite. He turns back and it's...
text: --a BALD MAN next to him, talking. Jack takes another bite,
dialog: turns back and it's...
text: --a BUSINESSMAN next to him. Jack takes another bite, turns
dialog: back, and it's...
text: --a BUSINESS WOMAN next to him.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: The people I meet on each flight --
dialog: they're single-serving friends.
dialog: Between take-off and landing, we have
dialog: our time together, but that's all we
dialog: get.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - LANDING
text: Jack's eyes snap open.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: You wake up at Logan.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: A giant corrugated METAL DOOR opens.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: On a long enough time line, the
dialog: survival rate for everyone drops to
dialog: zero.
text: Two TECHNICIANS lead Jack to the BURNT-OUT SHELL of a
text: WRECKED AUTOMOBILE. Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it
text: and starts to make notes on a CLIPBOARDED FORM.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I'm a recall coordinator. My job is
dialog: to apply the formula. It's a story
dialog: problem.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN #1
dialog: Here's where the infant went through
text: the windshield. Three points.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: A new car built by my company leaves
dialog: somewhere traveling at 60 miles per
text: hour. The rear differential locks up.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN #2
text: The teenager's braces around the
dialog: backseat ashtray would make a good
dialog: "anti-smoking" ad.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
text: The car crashes and burns with
dialog: everyone trapped inside. Now: do we
dialog: initiate a recall?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN #1
dialog: The father must've been huge. See
dialog: how the fat burnt into the driver's
dialog: seat with his polyester shirt? Very
dialog: "modern art."
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Take the number of vehicles in the
dialog: field, (A), and multiply it by the
dialog: probable rate of failure, (B), then
dialog: multiply the result by the average
dialog: out-of-court settlement, (C). A
dialog: times B times C equals X...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - MOVING DOWN RUNWAY
text: Jack is speaking to the BUSINESSWOMAN next to him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If X is less than the cost of a
dialog: recall, we don't do one.
speaker_heading: BUSISNESS WOMAN
dialog: Are there a lot of these kinds of
dialog: accidents?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, you wouldn't believe.
speaker_heading: BUSINESS WOMAN
dialog: ... Which... car company do you work
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A major one.
text: Turgid silence. Jack turns to the window. He sees a
text: PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Every time the plane banked too
dialog: sharply on take-off or landing, I
dialog: prayed for a crash, or a mid-air
dialog: collision -- anything.
text: Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane
text: BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles. People panic. Masks drop.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: No more haircuts. Nothing matters,
dialog: not even bad breath.
text: The side of the plane SHEARS OFF! Screaming PASSENGERS are
text: sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering
text: wind. Magazines and other objects fly everywhere.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Life insurance pays off triple if you
dialog: die on a business trip.
text: Jack remains in his same position, same bland expression.
text: DING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT. Jack SNAPS AWAKE.
text: EVERYTHING IS NORMAL. Some passengers get out of their
dialog: seats. From next to Jack, a VOICE we've heard before...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: There are three ways to make napalm.
dialog: One, mix equal parts of gasoline and
dialog: frozen orange juice...
text: Jack turns to see TYLER. Without turned to Jack, Tyler
dialog: continues:
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Two, equal parts gasoline and diet
dialog: cola. Three, dissolve kitty-litter
dialog: in gasoline until the mixture is
dialog: thick.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Pardon me?
text: Tyler turns to Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: This is how I met --
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Tyler Durden.
text: Tyler offers his hand. Jack takes it.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You know why they have oxygen masks
dialog: on planes?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, supply oxygen?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Oxygen gets you high. In a
dialog: catastrophic emergency, we're taking
text: giant, panicked breaths...
text: Tyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback,
dialog: hands it to Jack.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Suddenly, we become euphoic and
dialog: docile. We accept our fate.
text: Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Emergency water landing, 600 miles
dialog: per hour. Blank faces -- calm as
dialog: Hindu cows.
text: Jack laughs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you do, Tyler?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What do you want me to do?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I mean -- for a living.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Why? So you can say, "Oh, that's
dialog: what you do." -- And be a smug little
dialog: shit about it?
text: Jack laughs. Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him
text: and lifts a BRIEFCASE.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You have a kind of sick desperation
dialog: in your laugh.
text: Jack points to his own briefcase.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We have the same briefcase.
text: Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Open it.
text: Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the
text: lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Soap -- the yardstick of civilization.
dialog: (reaches in his pocket)
dialog: I make and sell soap...
text: Tyler hands Jack his card. "THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY."
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: If you were to add nitric acid to the
dialog: soap-making process, one would get
dialog: nitroglycerin. With enough soap, one
dialog: could blow up the world, if one were
dialog: so inclined.
text: Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut. Jack stares.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Tyler, you are by far the most
dialog: interesting "single-serving" friend
dialog: I've ever met.
text: Tyler stares back. Jack, enjoying his own chance to be
text: witty, leans closer to Tyler.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You see, when you travel, everything
dialog: is small, self-contained--
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: The spork. I get it. You're very
dialog: clever.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: How's that working out for you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Being clever.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (thrown)
dialog: Well, uh... great.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.
text: Tyler stands, looks towards the aisle.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: ... As I squeeze past, do I give you
dialog: the ass or the crotch?
text: Tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We are defined by the choices we make.
text: Tyler goes to the curtain dividing First Class, slaps the
text: curtain aside and sits in an empty seat. Jack watches.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: How I came to live with Tyler is:
dialog: airlines have this policy about
text: vibrating luggage.
scene_heading: INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT
text: Utterly empty of baggage. No people except for Jack and a
text: SECURITY TASK FORCE MAN. The Security TFM, smirking, holds
text: a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.
speaker_heading: SECURITY TFM
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Throwers don't worry about ticking.
dialog: Modern bombs don't tick.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Excuse me? "Throwers?"
speaker_heading: SECURITY TFM
dialog: Baggage handlers. But when a
text: suitcase vibrates, the throwers have
dialog: to call the police.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My suitcase was vibrating?
speaker_heading: SECURITY TFM
dialog: Nine time out of ten, it's an
dialog: electric razor. But, every once in
dialog: a while ...
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: ...it's a dildo. It's airline policy
dialog: not to imply ownership in the event
dialog: of a dildo. We use the indefinite
dialog: aricle: "A dildo." Never "Your
dialog: dildo."
text: Jack sees, through the window, Tyler, at the curb, throwing
text: his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red CONVERTIBLE.
text: Tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and PEELS
text: OUT. jack turns away, looks at the Security TFM.
text: In the background, a HARRIED MAN dashes after Tyler and the
dialog: convertible, SCREAMING.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Security TFM)
dialog: I had everything in that bag. My
dialog: C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
speaker_heading: SECURITY TFM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yeah, uh huh... yeah?
dialog: (pause, still on phone)
dialog: Oh...
scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY RUNWAY
text: A lone SUITCASE sits on the concrete. SECURITY PERSONNEL
text: keep their distance. KABOOM! The suitcase explodes.
scene_heading: INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - RESUMING
text: The Security TFM, shakes his head, hangs up.
speaker_heading: SECURITY TFM
dialog: I'm terribly sorry.
text: The Security TFM hands Jack a claim form. Jack snatches it,
text: disgusted, takes out a pen, starts filling out the form.
speaker_heading: SECURITY TFM
dialog: You know the industry slang for
dialog: "Flight Attendant?" "Air Mattress."
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Along a residential street. Jack looks ahead, sees a tall,
text: grey, bland BUILDING on the corner.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Home was a condo on the fifteenth
dialog: floor of a filing cabinet for widows
dialog: and young professionals. The walls
text: were solid concrete. A foot of
dialog: concrete is important when your next-
text: door neighbor lets her hearing aid go
dialog: and has to watch game shows at full
dialog: volume...
text: The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the
text: building. A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-
scene_heading: OUT SECTION of the fifteenth floor. FIRETRUCKS, POLICE CARS
text: and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: -- Or when a volcanic blast of debris
dialog: that used to be your furniture and
dialog: personal effects blows out your floor-
text: to-ceiling windows and sails flaming
dialog: into the night.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUILDING
text: Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the
text: Cabbie money. The taxi pulls away. Jack starts toward the
text: building. He pushes through the fray of people, into the...
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY
text: The DOORMAN sees Jack enter, gives a sad smile, shakes his
text: head. Jack starts for the elevator.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: There's nothing up there.
text: Jack presses the button. The Doorman moves next to him.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: You can't go into the unit. Police
dialog: orders.
text: The elevator doors open. Jack hesitates. The doors close.
text: Jack heads out the lobby doors. The Doorman follows...
scene_heading: EXT. CONDO BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE
text: from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part
text: of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR. His feet CRUNCH glass.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: How embarrassing.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Do you have somebody you can call?
text: Jack comes to his REFRIGERATOR lying on its side. He
text: reaches down and takes a note: "MARLA --" and a phone
text: number, from under a BANANA MAGNET.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S STOVE
dialog: Hissing.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: The police would later tell me that
dialog: the pilot light might have gone
dialog: out... letting out just a little bit
dialog: of gas.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING
text: Jack gets to a PAYPHONE. The Doorman follows, watching him.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Lots of young people try to impress
dialog: the world and buy too many things.
text: Jack picks up the receiver, puts in a quarter. He looks at
text: Marla's number a long moment.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S ENTIRE CONDO - KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM
text: The SOUND of the HISS...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: The gas could have slowly filled the
dialog: condo. Seventeen-hundred square feet
dialog: with high ceilings, for days and days.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING
text: Jack replaces the receiver. He pockets Marla's number, digs
text: out a small FILOFAX. He flips through the pages for phone
text: numbers and addresses. Most of the pages are blank.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Many young people feel trapped and
dialog: desperate.
scene_heading: INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
text: Then, the refrigerator's compressor
dialog: could have clicked on...
text: Click. KABOOM! SCREEN GOES WHITE.
scene_heading: EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING
text: Jack looks at the Doorman. Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from
text: the Filofax. Jack catches it.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: If you don't know what you want, you
dialog: end up with a lot you don't.
text: The Doorman walks away. Jack stares at Tyler's card.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: If you asked me now, I couldn't tell
dialog: you why I called him.
text: Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number. It
text: RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS. Jack sighs and hangs up the
text: phone. A moment, then the phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: TYLER'S VOICE
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Tyler?
speaker_heading: TYLER'S VOICE
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Uh... I'm sorry. We met on the
dialog: plane. We had the same briefcase.
dialog: I'm... you know, the clever guy.
speaker_heading: TYLER'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I just called a second ago. There
dialog: was no answer. I'm at a payphone.
speaker_heading: TYLER'S VOICE
dialog: I star-sixty-nined you. I never pick
dialog: up my phone. What's up?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well... let me see... here's the
dialog: thing...
scene_heading: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT
text: A small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME
text: Jack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of BEER.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You buy furniture. You tell
dialog: yourself: this is the last sofa I'll
dialog: ever need. No matter what else
dialog: happens, I've got the sofa issue
dialog: handled. Then, the right set of
text: dishes. The right dinette.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This is how we fill up our lives.
text: Tyler lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I guess so.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: And, now it's gone.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: All gone.
text: Tyler offers cigarettes. Jack declines.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Could be worse. A woman could cut
dialog: off your penis while you're asleep
dialog: and toss it out the window of a
dialog: moving car.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There's always that.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe
dialog: it's a terrible tragedy.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ...no ...no ...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I mean, you did lose a lot of nice,
dialog: neat little shit. The trendy paper
dialog: lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit,
dialog: am I right?
text: Jack laughs, nods. He shakes his head, drinks.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: But maybe, just maybe, you've been
dialog: delivered.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (toasts)
text: Delivered from Swedish furniture.
speaker_heading: TYLER
text: Delivered from armchairs in obscure
dialog: green stripe patterns.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Delivered from Martha Stewart.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Delivered from bullshit colors like
dialog: "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
text: They laugh together. Then, silence. They drink.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Insurance'll cover it.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the
dialog: list.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What list?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: The "now I get to go out and buy the
dialog: exact same stuff all over again"
dialog: list. That list.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't... think so.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This time maybe get a widescreen TV.
dialog: You'll be occupied for weeks.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, I have to file a claim...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: The things you own, they end up
dialog: owning you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't I?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Do what you like.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (looks at watch)
dialog: God, it's late. I should find a
dialog: hotel...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: A hotel?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: So, you called me up, because you
dialog: just wanted to have a drink before
dialog: you... go find a hotel?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't follow...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We're on our third pitcher of beer.
dialog: Just ask me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You called me so you could have a
dialog: place to stay.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, I...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Why don't you cut the shit and ask if
dialog: you can stay at my place?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Would that be a problem?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Is it a problem for you to ask?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Can I stay at your place?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Yes, you can.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You're welcome. But, I want you to
dialog: do me one favor.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I want you to hit me as hard as you
dialog: can.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I want you to hit me as hard as you
dialog: can.
dialog: Freeze picture.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Let me tell you a little bit about
dialog: Tyler Durden.
scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSE-UP - FILM FRAME
dialog: -- And we see it's PORNOGRAPHY.
scene_heading: INT. PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT
text: Jack, in the foreground, FACES CAMERA. In the BACKGROUND,
text: Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual FRAMES cut from
text: movies. Near him, a PROJECTOR rolls film.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Tyler was a night person. He
dialog: sometimes worked as a projectionist.
dialog: A movie doesn't come in one big reel,
text: it's on a few. In old theaters, two
dialog: projectors are used, so someone has
dialog: to change projectors at the exact
dialog: second when one reel ends and
dialog: another reel begins. Sometimes you
text: can see two dots on screen in the
dialog: upper right hand corner...
text: Tyler points to the side of OUR FRAME and the TWO DOTS
text: briefly APPEAR ONSCREEN.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: They're called "cigarette burns."
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's called a "changeover." The
dialog: movie goes on, and nobody in the
dialog: audience has any idea.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Why would anyone want this shitty job?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It affords him other interesting
dialog: opportunities.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: -- Like splicing single frames from
dialog: adult movies into family films.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: In reel three, right after the
dialog: courageous dog and the snooty cag --
dialog: who have celebrity voices -- eat out
dialog: of a garbage can, there's the flash
dialog: of Tyler's contribution...
text: In the AUDIENCE, CHILDREN suddenly start squirming,
text: confused, looking at each other.
text: A WOMAN abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling
text: vaguely terrible. Her uncomfortable HUSBAND slowly leans
text: back in his seat.
text: Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: One-forty-eighth of a second. That's
dialog: how long it's up there.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No one really knows that they've seen it.
dialog: But they did.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: A nice, big cock.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Only a hummingbird could have caught
dialog: Tyler at work.
scene_heading: INT. LARGE BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
text: Tyler moves around one of many tables, setting down SOUP
text: BOWLS. Jack stands in the same position, FACING CAMERA.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter
dialog: at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.
text: The GUESTS command the WAITERS with snaps of fingers.
scene_heading: INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT
text: Jack turns and WE PAN to Tyler, standing by a CART with a
text: giant SOUP TUREEN. His hands are at his open fly and he's
text: in position to piss into the soup.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He was the guerrilla terrorist of the
dialog: food service industry.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Don't watch. I can't if you watch.
text: Jack waits. The SOUND of a STREAM of LIQUID is HEARD.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: ... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: He farted on meringue; he sneezed on
dialog: braised endive; and, with creme of
dialog: mushroom soup, well...
speaker_heading: TYLER (O.S.)
dialog: Go ahead. Say it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You get the idea.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT OF TAVERN - RESUMING
text: Tyler and Jack come out the back door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know about this.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I don't know, either. I want to find
dialog: out. I've never been hit, have you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. That's a good thing, isn't it?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I don't want to die without any
dialog: scars. How much can you really know
dialog: about yourself if you've never been
dialog: in a fight? Come on... you're the
dialog: only person I've ever asked.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Me?
text: Jack stares at him.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Why not you? I'm letting you go
dialog: first. Do it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This is crazy.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Alright, go crazy. Let 'er rip.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where do you want it? In the face?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Surprise me.
text: Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's
text: neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shit. Sorry. That didn't count.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Like hell. That counted.
text: Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest. Jack
text: falls back against a car. His eyes tear up.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Strange.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: But a good strange.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We've crossed the threshold. You
dialog: want to call it off?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Call what off?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: The fight.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What fight?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This fight, pussy.
text: Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under
text: Tyler's ear. Tyler punches Jack in the stomach. Tyler and
text: Jack move clumsily, throwing punches. They breathe heavier,
text: drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.
scene_heading: EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER
text: Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights
text: on the nearby freeway. Their eyes are glazed with endorphin-
text: induced serenity. They look at each other, laugh. Look away.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: If you could fight anyone... one on
dialog: one, whoever you wanted, who would
dialog: you fight?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Anyone?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Anyone.
dialog: Jack thinks.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My boss, probably.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Who would you fight?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: My dad. No question.
text: A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, yeah.
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: I didn't know my dad. Well, I knew
dialog: him, till I was six. He went and
dialog: married another woman, had more kids.
dialog: Every six years or so he'd do it
dialog: again -- new city, new family.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: He was setting up franchises. My
dialog: father never went to college, so it
dialog: was really important that I go.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I know that.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: After I graduated, I called him long
dialog: distance and asked, "Now what?" He
dialog: said, "Get a job." When I turned
dialog: twenty-five, I called him and asked,
dialog: "Now what?" He said, "I don't know.
dialog: Get married."
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Same here.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: A generation of men raised by women.
dialog: I'm wondering if another woman is the
dialog: answer we really need.
text: Another pause. Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We should do this again sometime.
text: Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.
scene_heading: EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT
text: A street sign: "PAPER STREET." A PAPER MILL stis on one
text: side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other. The rest of the
text: land is grass and weeds. It's a grand, old three-story,
text: long abandoned. Tyler leads Jack toward it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where's your car?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What car?
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I don't know how Tyler found the
dialog: house, but he'd been there for half
dialog: a year.
scene_heading: INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT
text: Tyler leads Jack through the FRONT DOOR...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: It looked like it was waiting to be
text: torn down. Most of the windows were
dialog: boarded up.
scene_heading: INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER
text: Tyler and Jack climb CREAKY STAIRS to the 2ND FLOOR LANDING.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
text: None of the doors locked. The stairs
dialog: were ready to collapse. I didn't
dialog: know if he owned it or he was
dialog: squatting.
text: Tyler opens the door to a ROOM...
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack enters, stis on the creaky BED. Dust drifts upwards.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Neither would have surprised me.
scene_heading: INT. SHOWER - MORNING
text: Jack turns on the water. LOUD VIBRATIONS from the walls.
text: Water spits in starts.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Nothing worked. The rusty plumbing
dialog: leaked. Turning on a light meant
text: another light in the house went out.
scene_heading: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: All the tavern's lights are off. Tyler and Jack FIGHT.
text: FIVE GUYS stand around watching.
scene_heading: INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Jack, his face showing NEW BRUISES AND CUTS, makes coffee
text: with a wire-mesh strainer. Tyler shuffles in, wearing a
text: flannel bathrobe. He spears pieces of bread on a fork,
text: starts roasting them over a burner.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: There were no neighbors. Just
dialog: warehouses and the paper mill. The
text: fart smell of steam, the hamster cage
dialog: smell of wood chips.
scene_heading: EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Jack sits watching as Tyler SWINGS an old GOLF CLUB --
text: THWACK -- sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: At night, Tyler and I were alone for
text: half a mile in every direction.
scene_heading: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: All the lights are off. TEN GUYS YELL, standing around Jack
text: and Tyler, who FIGHT. THREE CARS are parked in the lot.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - DAY
text: Jack sits on basement stairs, watching as Tyler, knee-deep
text: in water, works at an open FUSEBOX, flipping breakers in a
text: certain order, showing Jack how it's done.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: When it rained, we had to kill the
dialog: power. By the end of the first
dialog: month, I didn't care about TV. I
dialog: didn't mind the warm, stale
dialog: refrigerator.
scene_heading: INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT
text: CANDLES BURN. Tyler and Jack are seated across from each
text: other on the buckled floor, reading MAGAZINES. Rain DRIPS
text: from the ceiling. No furniture. THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: The previous occupant had been a bit
dialog: of a shut-in.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (of magazine)
dialog: Hum.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Oh, a new riot control grenade...
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "...the successful combination of
dialog: concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash-
text: blasts and simultaneous high-velocity
dialog: disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
text: Tyler begins RIPPING the ARTICLE from his magazine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ("Reader's Digest")
dialog: "I am Joe's Lungs." It's written in
dialog: first person. "Without me, Joe could
dialog: not take in oxygen to feed his red
dialog: blood cells." There's a whole
dialog: series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: "I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
text: Tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles,
dialog: chooses another magazine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are you reading?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Soldier of Fortune. Business Week.
dialog: New Republic.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Show-off.
scene_heading: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: All the lights are off. Jack and Tyler stand amidst FIFTEEN
text: GUYS around TWO GUYS FIGHTING. The crowd YELLS MORE WILDLY
text: than before. In the background are EIGHT PARKED CARS.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I should have been haggling with my
dialog: insurance company. I should have
dialog: been looking for a new condo...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Jack walks along. He stops, looking at a CHURCH with
text: SUPPORT-GROUP-PEOPLE milling around the entrance, drinking
text: coffee and sodas. Marla's there, amongst them, smoking.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: .... I should have been upset about
dialog: my nice, neat, flaming little shit.
text: Jack's face shows no reaction. He continues to walk.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: But I wasn't.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Jack, in work clothes, interlocks his fingers and POPS his
text: knuckles, picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips. Tyler,
text: in waiter's uniform, comes to have Jack straighten his tie.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Most of the week, we were Ozzie and
dialog: Harriet.
text: Jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday
dialog: night...
scene_heading: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: All the lights are off. No one around, but there are at
text: least TWENTY-FIVE CARS parked in the full lot.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: ... we were finding something out: we
dialog: were finding out, more and more, that
dialog: we were not alone.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: A SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper salesman, WALTER.
text: Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and a BRUISED cheek.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Thursday mornings, all I could do was
dialog: think about next week.
text: Boss gives Jack a dubious look. Walter's next SLIDE: a
scene_heading: COMPUTER SCREEN.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The basic premise of cyber-netting
dialog: your office is -- make things more
dialog: efficient.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's V.O.:
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Walter, the Microsoft account exec.
text: Walter, with his smooth, soft hands.
dialog: Maybe he was thinking about the free-
dialog: range potluck he'd been to last
dialog: weekend, or his church-group car-wash
dialog: fund-raiser. Or, probably not.
text: Walter moves to Jack and slaps him in the shoulder.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I showed this already to my man here.
dialog: You liked it, didn't you?
text: Jack smiles. His teeth are RED with BLOOD. They GLOW
text: eerily in the dim light.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: You can swallow a pint of blood
dialog: before you get sick.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Jesus, I'd hate to see what happened
dialog: to the other guy.
text: Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Screw Walter. His candy-ass wouldn't
dialog: last a second Wednesday night.
scene_heading: EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT
text: Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all
text: directions. CARS PULL UP and park in the already-packed
dialog: lot. YOUNG MEN get out and march into the tavern...
scene_heading: INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME
text: The men, including Jack and Tyler, enter and stand against
text: the back wall, waiting. The bartender, IRVINE, calls out:
speaker_heading: IRVINE
dialog: Drink up people. We're closing.
text: Irvine flicks on the LIGHTS. Drunken customers squint and
text: get the message. They plop down money, leaving.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
text: It was right in everyone's face.
dialog: Tyler and I just made it visible.
text: Irvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power. Members
text: of the waiting army begins to share secret looks. Finally,
text: one buy locks the door. Two other guys close the blinds.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: It was on the tip of everyone's
dialog: tongue. Tyler and I just gave it a
dialog: name.
scene_heading: INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME
text: A BOMB-SHELTER. Concrete walls. One BARE BULB above, Tyler
text: standing directly beneath it.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Welcome to fight club.
text: The guys mill around, finding partners. Everyone brims with
text: eagerness, but tries to act cool. CHATTER gets LOUDER.
text: Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Every week, Tyler gave the rules that
dialog: he and I decided.
text: PEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER
text: DIES. A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: The first rule of fight club is --
dialog: you don't talk about fight club. The
dialog: second rule of fight club is -- you
dialog: don't talk about fight club. The
dialog: third rule of fight club is -- when
dialog: someone says "stop" or goes limp, the
dialog: fight is over. Fourth rule is --
dialog: only two guys to a fight. Fifth
dialog: rule -- one fight at a time. Sixth
dialog: rule -- no shirts, no shoes. Seventh
dialog: rule -- fights go on as long as they
dialog: have to. And the eighth and final
dialog: rule -- if this is your first night
dialog: at fight club, you have to fight.
text: Tyler steps back. A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN
text: take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --
dialog: couldn't remember whether you ordered
text: pens with blue ink or black ink ...
text: The two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
dialog: last week when he trounced an actuary
dialog: twice his size.
text: Harder, faster PUNCHES between the two. SWEAT flies.
text: SHOUTS become DEAFENING. Ricky's getting the best of
dialog: Goateed Man, POUNDING him...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Sometimes all you could hear were
text: flat, hard packing sounds over the
dialog: yelling, or the wet choke when
dialog: someone caught their breath and
dialog: sprayed...
speaker_heading: GOATEED MAN
dialog: (spittle-lipped)
dialog: Ssssstop... !
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Jack, eating lunch, watches the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a
text: GOATEE -- from the above fight -- converse with a MAITRE D'.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Even if I could tell someone they had
dialog: a good fight, I wouldn't be talking
dialog: to the same man.
text: The Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda
text: down on the table. The two of them briefly make eye contact.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Who you were in fight club is not who
dialog: you were in the rest of the world.
scene_heading: INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY
text: Jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light.
text: He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an
text: apron, push a supply cart. Ricks nods at Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: You weren't alive anywhere like you
dialog: were there. But fight club only
dialog: exists in the hours between when
dialog: fight club starts and when fight club
dialog: ends.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Jack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from
text: his mouth with a handkerchief. Boss, passing by the
text: doorway, looks in at Jack, irritated.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: What are you getting yourself into
dialog: every week?
text: Jack keeps playing Solitaire. Boss enters, folds his arms.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: After fight club, everything else in
dialog: your life gets the volume turned
dialog: down. You can deal with anything.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: Have you finished those reports?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (handing him reports)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: The people who had power over you
dialog: have less and less.
text: Jack looks at Boss. Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with
dialog: his teeth.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: By this point, I could wiggle most of
dialog: the teeth in my jaw.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DUSK
text: Tyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: A guy came to fight club for the
dialog: first time, his ass was a wad of
dialog: cookie dough. After a few weeks, he
dialog: was carved out of wood.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If you could fight any celebrity?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Alive or dead?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Hemingway. You?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shatner. William Shatner.
text: They reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their
dialog: cigarettes, getting on board...
scene_heading: INT. BUS - DUSK
text: The bus is crowded. As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back,
text: Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: We all started seeing things
dialog: differently. Wherever we went.
text: They hold hand grips. Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a
text: CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I felt sorry for all the guys packing
text: into gyms, trying to look like what
dialog: Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said
dialog: they should.
text: Tyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Self-improvement is masturbation.
dialog: Self-destruction is the answer.
text: A MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes. The
text: Man takes a handle, close by. Jack's pissed, staring at the
text: man, who stares back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Tyler, so the
dialog: Man can hear)
dialog: You could take him.
text: Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man.
text: Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: The trick is not to care.
text: Tyler stares forward.
scene_heading: INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Tyler HITS the floor, stomach first. HIS OPPONENT lands on
text: top of him, grappling, trying for a CHOKE HOLD. The
text: surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them...
text: Tyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips
text: his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him. Tyler
text: turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach --
text: brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw.
text: Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.
text: Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching
text: appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Fight club wasn't about winning or
dialog: losing. It wasn't about words.
text: The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack. Jack
text: snakes his arm into a counter headlock. They wrestle like
text: wild animals. The crowd CHEERS maniacally.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: They hysterical shouting was in
text: tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.
text: Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER.
text: The Opponent SMASHES Jack's head to the floor, over and over.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... stop...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: When the fight was over, nothing was
dialog: solved, but nothing mattered.
text: Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away. Tyler pushes
text: through the crowd. Others lift Jack up. They turn their
text: attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face --
text: similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Cool.
text: Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.
speaker_heading: OPPONENT
dialog: How about next week?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look at me. How about next month?
text: Everyone helps Jack walk. He's sweating, bleeding, smiling.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Afterwards, we all felt saved.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT
text: A NURSE tends to Jack while Tyler watches.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: He fell down some stairs.
text: The Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I fell down some stairs.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Sometimes Tyler spoke for me.
scene_heading: INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
text: Tyler and Jack share the cracked MIRROR. Tyler's clipping
text: at his hair with blunt, ill-suited SCISSORS. Jack's
text: brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Fight club became the reason to cut
dialog: your hair short and trim your
dialog: fingernails.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Any historical figure.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay... Ghandi.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Good answer.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys
dialog: fight till they're burger.
text: Jack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a
text: TOOTH. Jack looks at it. Tyler puts scissors down, done.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Remember, even the Mona Lisa's
dialog: falling apart.
text: Jack drops the tooth in the sink with Tyler's hair.
scene_heading: INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Jack enters, buttoning his shirt. The PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hello?
text: INTERCUT WITH...
scene_heading: INT. MARLA'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - SAME
text: Marla's in the HALL, on the PAYPHONE, twisting the phone
text: cord around her neck.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Where have you been the last few
dialog: weeks?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Marla?
text: Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy
text: flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups. Jack leans, cups the phone.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: How did you find me?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: The forwarding number. I haven't
dialog: seen you at any support groups.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's the idea -- we split them.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: You haven't been going to yours.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I found a new one.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's for men.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Like testicular cancer?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look, this is a bad time...
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: I've been going to debtor's
dialog: anonymous. You want to see some
dialog: truly fucked up people?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm just on my way out...
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Me too. I got a stomach full of
dialog: Xanax. I took what was left of a
dialog: bottle. Might've been too much.
text: Jack looks exasperated, turns TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Picture yourself watching Marla
dialog: Singer throw herself around her
text: crummy apartment.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
dialog: This is probably one of those cry-for-
dialog: help things.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: This could go on for hours.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: So you're staying in tonight?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Do you want to wait to hear me
dialog: describe death?
text: Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the
text: hook, walks out the back door.
speaker_heading: MARLA'S VOICE
dialog: Do you want to listen and see if my
dialog: spirit can use the telephone?
text: Thru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION. Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES,
text: LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT.
text: Sheets RIP. Bodies hit the FLOOR. Insane GRUNTING and
text: LAUGHING. A flash of MARLA'S FACE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE
text: Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room.
scene_heading: INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING
text: Jack steps out of his room. The neighboring door is closed.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Tyler's door was closed. I'd been
dialog: living here two months, and Tyler's
dialog: door was never closed.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - SAME
text: Jack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest.
text: He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're not going to believe what I
dialog: dreamt last night.
text: Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's
text: been raped by a hurricane. Jack's jaw drops.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: I can hardly believe anything about
dialog: last night.
text: Marla goes to pour coffee. She takes a swig, GARGLES and
text: SPITS it in the sink. She gives Jack a lascivious smile.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: What... ?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
text: Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Fuck you.
text: Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out.
text: Jack gets up, watches her stomp away.
text: Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after
text: Marla. He's in his usual sweatpants. He grins at Jack,
text: then moves away, pours himself coffee. Jack, smoldering,
text: slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest. Tyler
text: puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: She's a piece of work. Get this --
dialog: I come in here last night, the
dialog: phone's off the hook...
text: Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler. TYLER'S
speaker_heading: VOICE FADES...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I already knew the story before he
dialog: told it to me.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)
text: Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens.
speaker_heading: MARLA'S VOICE
dialog: (from handset)
dialog: I'll tell you when I'm floating out

text: Tyler smiles.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: How could Tyler, off all people, think
dialog: it was a bad thing that Marla Singer
dialog: was about to die?
scene_heading: INT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)
text: Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars,
text: looking at the rotting walls. He reaches the top of the
text: stairs and heads for Marla's room. Before he can knock,
text: Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him...
scene_heading: INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)
text: Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door. Her drugged
text: eyes look him over.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: You got here fast.
text: She staggers and sits on the bed. She slides off, along
text: with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.
speaker_heading: MARLA
text: The mattresses are all sealed in
dialog: slippery plastic.
text: She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Did I call you?
text: Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO
text: lying atop a dresser. Marla follows his gaze.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
text: SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors
text: opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Oh, no! Somebody called the cops...
text: She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door.
speaker_heading: INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK)
text: Marla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE.
text: COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits.
text: Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: 8-G! Where's 8-G?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: End of the hall.
text: The rescuers keep running.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: (calling after)
dialog: The girl who lives there used to be
dialog: a charming, lovely girl, but she's
dialog: lost faith in herself...
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Miss Singer, let us help you! You
dialog: have every reason to live!
text: Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: She's a monster! Infectious human
dialog: waste! Good luck trying to save her!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: Tyler makes coffee. Marla slouches against the refrigerator.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
dialog: You're gonna have to keep me up all
dialog: night.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)
text: Tyler chuckles, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Unbelievable, huh?
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: He was obviously able to handle it.
text: Tyler stands across from Jack, gets a cigarette from a pack.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I mean, this girl... uh, you're not
dialog: into her or anything... ?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No. Not at all.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I am Jack's Raging Bile Duct.
text: Tyler lights his cigarette.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You're sure?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, I'm sure.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Good. This chick was up on the table
text: with her legs in the stirrups before
dialog: the doctor even walked in the room.
dialog: The things that she said... I've
dialog: never heard a woman talk like that...
scene_heading: INT. TYLER'S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: Tyler smokes, post-coital. Marla puts her lips to his ear.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I want to have your abortion.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)
text: Tyler laughs, shakes his head. Jack's gripping his Reader's
dialog: Digest just a little too tight.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: How could Tyler not go for that?
dialog: Night before last, he was splicing
dialog: sex organs into "Little Mermaid."
text: Tyler sits, studies Jack's face.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You're okay with this?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Put a gun to my head and paint the
dialog: wall with my brains.
dialog: Tyler smokes.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: She is a wild, twisted bitch. Stay
dialog: away from that one.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Hey... don't knock librarians.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Marla doesn't need a lover. She
dialog: needs a case worker.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: She needs an exorcist. This isn't
dialog: love. This is sport-fucking.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: She'd invaded my support groups, now
dialog: she's invading my home.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Listen... do me a favor... sit here
dialog: a minute...
text: Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it. Jack puts
text: down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You've gotta understand something
dialog: about me. I have a little rule,
dialog: okay? Don't ever talk to her about
dialog: me. Ever. I can't stand that kind
dialog: of shit.
text: Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: If you ever say anything about me or
dialog: about what happens here in this
dialog: house, to her or anyone -- I will
dialog: find out. And you'll never see me
dialog: again. Promise me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Promise you won't.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes, I promise.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Promise?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I said I promise!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: That was three times you promised.
text: Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves. Jack sits smoldering.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: If only I had wasted a couple of
dialog: minutes and gone to watch Marla die,
dialog: none of this would have happened.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack watches TV at HIGH VOLUME. SOUNDS of SEX from upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack lies calmly on his bed, staring at the ceiling. Sounds
text: of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall.
speaker_heading: MARLA'S VOICE
dialog: (muffled through wall)
dialog: Miserable fucking discharge!
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I could've moved to another room, one
dialog: on the third floor -- so I wouldn't
dialog: have heard them. But I didn't.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: SOUNDS of RAIN. Jack flips FUSES off, then walks upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME
text: Jack walks, HEARS Marla SCREAM in orgasm. He reaches the
text: landing. Tyler's door is ajar. Jack peeks in...
text: Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed. The door PUSHES OPEN
text: WIDER -- Tyler, naked, stands CLOSE TO CAMERA.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Jack steps back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I... uh... just going to bed.
text: Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You want to finish her off?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Uh... nah...
text: Jack continues toward his room.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack brushes his teeth.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I became the calm, little center of
dialog: the world. I was the Zen master.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR
text: Haiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font.
dialog: "Worker bees can leave
dialog: Even drones can fly away
dialog: The queen is their slave"
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I wrote little haiku poems.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD. He sits
text: in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I faxed them around to everyone.
text: He hits "SEND," gets the "ERROR CHIME" SOUND. He presses
text: this key over and over. Boss enters.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: Is that your blood?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Some of it, yes.
text: Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: Take the rest of the day off. Come
dialog: back tomorrow with clean clothes.
dialog: Get yourself together.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
text: Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS
text: who coldly stare at him. His face is totally passive.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I got right in everyone's hostile
dialog: little face. Yes, these are bruises
dialog: from fighting. I'm comfortable with
dialog: them. I am enlightened.
scene_heading: EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET
text: Jack walks toward the HOUSE.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: You give up the condo life, give up
dialog: all your flaming worldly possessions,
dialog: go live in a dilapidated house in the
dialog: toxic waste part of town...
scene_heading: INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET
text: Jack walks in. SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA
text: from upstairs. Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: ... and you come home to this.
speaker_heading: TYLER'S VOICE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You fucking slut!!
speaker_heading: MARLA'S VOICE
dialog: Thank you, sir, may I have another!
dialog: Thank you sir, may I have another... !
text: Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants. He runs water in
text: the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood
text: stains. The PHONE RINGS. He answers it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah. Speaking.
text: INTERCUT WITH...
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE
text: A cop, DETECTIVE STERN, refers to a file.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE STERN
dialog: This is Detective Stern with the
dialog: arson unit. We have some new
dialog: information about the "incident" at
dialog: your condo.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE STERN
dialog: I don't know if you're aware... your
dialog: front door -- it seems someone
text: sprayed freon into the lock, then
text: tapped it with a chisel to shatter
dialog: the cylinder.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, I wasn't aware...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE STERN
dialog: Does this sound strange to you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes, sire, strange. Very strange.
text: Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE STERN
dialog: The dynamite...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Dynamite?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE STERN
dialog: Yes. It left a residue of ammonium
dialog: oxalate and potassium perchloride.
dialog: Do you know what that means?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE STERN
dialog: It means it was homemade.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This is... really a shock...
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE STERN
dialog: Whoever set this homemade dynamite
dialog: could've blown out the pilot light
dialog: days before the explosion. The gas,
dialog: it seems, was just a detonator.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Who do you think could've done this?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE STERN
dialog: I'll ask the questions, son.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (whispering in Jack's ear)
dialog: Tell him...
text: Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler
text: standing right next to him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (overlap w/below)
dialog: "The liberator who destroyed my
dialog: property has re-aligned my paradigm
dialog: of perception."
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shhhhhh!
dialog: (into phone,
dialog: overlap w/above)
dialog: I don't know what to make of this,
dialog: sir, I really don't...
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE STERN
dialog: Do you know anyone who'd have the
dialog: expertise or motive to do something
dialog: like this?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: "I reject the basic assumptions of
dialog: civilization, including material
dialog: possession."
text: Jack pushes Tyler away, cups the receiving.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: No. No, sir. I loved that condo.
dialog: I loved every stick of furniture.
dialog: The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were
dialog: me. The dishes were me. The plants
dialog: were...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I'd like to thank the academy...
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE STERN
dialog: Well, if any ideas come to you, give
dialog: me a call. In the meantime, don't
dialog: leave town. I may need to bring you
dialog: in for questioning.
speaker_heading: END INTERCUT
text: Jack hangs up. Tyler shrugs.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Could be worse. You could be cursed
dialog: with the three terrible Karmas. You
dialog: could be beautiful, rich and famous.
text: Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants. Marla's
text: FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs...
text: Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing
text: water. He turns, sees Marla enter. Tyler is GONE. Marla
text: lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Except for their humping, Tyler and
dialog: Marla were never in the same room.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: I got this dress at a thrift store
dialog: for one dollar.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (keeps scrubbing)
dialog: Worth every penny.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: My parents pulled this exact act for
dialog: years -- one came in, the other
dialog: disappeared.
text: Marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to
text: Jack. She lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close
text: to Jack's body, almost touhcing.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: (seductive)
dialog: It's a bridesmaid's dress. Someone
dialog: loved it intensely for one day, then
dialog: tossed it. Like a Christmas tree --
dialog: so special, then, bam -- it's
text: abandoned on the side of the road,
text: tinsel still clinging to it...
text: Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses
text: against the counter. Marla pulls her hemline further up.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Like sex crime victims, underwear
text: inside-out, bound with electrical
dialog: tape.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: It suits you.
text: She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: You can borrow it sometime.
text: Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing. Marla blows smoke
text: in his face. Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the
text: sink. Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS.
speaker_heading: TYLER (O.S.)
dialog: Get rid of her.
text: Jack turns to see Tyler in the doorway.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You get rid of her.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (pointing at Jack)
dialog: Don't mention me.
text: Marla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS. Jack looks to the
text: archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE. Marla enters, shoes
text: and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something
text: on the junk strewn table.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I'm six years old again, passing
dialog: messages between my parents.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I, uh... think you should go now.
text: Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things,
text: pushing other things off to the floor.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's time for you to leave.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Don't worry, I'm leaving.
text: Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes. She
text: moves up into Jack's face.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: You're such a nutcase, I can't even
dialog: begin to keep up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Goodbye.
text: She laughs, spins on her heels. As she exits the back door,
dialog: she sings "This Merry-Go-Round" from "Valley of the Dolls."
text: Jack watches her through the kitchen window.
speaker_heading: TYLER (O.S.)
dialog: Nice work.
text: Jack turns. Tyler's right behind him. Through the window,
text: Marla can be seen walking away. Tyler picks up the remnant
text: of SOAP Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: To make soap, first we have to render
dialog: fat.
text: Jack looks at Tyler.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - SIGN: "DANGER - BIOHAZARD."
scene_heading: EXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT
text: Tyler stands inside the fence. Jack's atop the fence,
text: struggling to cross BARBED WIRE. He wobbles, gets over,
text: snags his shirt. Jack falls, RIPPPPP. Tyler helps.
text: FOOTSTEPS. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM. Tyler pulls Jack behind a
text: DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS. A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD
text: moves along the perimeter, flashlight first. He walks away.
text: MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding. Tyler
text: eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: The best fat for making soap --
dialog: because the salt balance is just
dialog: right -- comes form human bodies...
text: Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What is this place?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: A liposuction clinic.
text: From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized,
text: thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Paydirt. From society's richest
text: asses and thighs.
text: TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying
text: BAGS of fat. One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down
text: the chain-link fench. Jack slips and slides. Tyler laughs.
text: Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Jack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot.
speaker_heading: TYLER
text: As the fat renders, the tallow floats
dialog: to the surface. Remember the crap
dialog: they taught you in Boy Scouts.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This clear layer in glycerin. We'll
dialog: mix it back in when we make the soap.
text: Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the
text: glycerin layer. Then, he crabs a can, opens it.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Lye -- the crucial ingredient.
dialog: (adding lye to mix)
dialog: Ancient peoples found their clothes
dialog: got cleaner if they washed them at a
dialog: certain spot in the river. Why?
dialog: Because, human sacrifices were once
dialog: made on the hills above this river.
dialog: Year after year, bodies burnt. Rain
dialog: feel. Water seeped through the wood
dialog: ashes to become lye. The lye
dialog: combined with the melted fat of the
text: bodies, till a thick white soapy
dialog: discharge crept into the river.
text: Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet. He takes
text: Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: The first soap was made from the
dialog: ashes of heroes. Like the first
dialog: monkeys shot into space.
text: The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss. Tyler pours a
text: bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Without sacrifice, without death, we
dialog: would have nothing.
text: Jack's whole body JERKS. Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand
text: and arm. Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This is a chemical burn. It will
dialog: hurt more than you've ever been
dialog: burned and you will have a scar.
text: Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of
text: Tyler's kiss. Jack's face spasms.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
text: Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the
dialog: back of my hand.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Look at your hand.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Guided meditation worked for cancer,
dialog: it could work for this.
scene_heading: SHOT OF A GREEN MAPLE LEAF, GLISTENING WITH DEW. RESUME:
text: Tyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Come back to the pain. Don't shut
dialog: this out.
text: Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away. Tyler
text: keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I tried not to think of the words
dialog: "searing" or "flesh." I imagined my
text: pain as a ball of healing white light.
scene_heading: SHOT OF A FOREST, IN GENTLE SPRING RAINFALL. RESUME:
text: Tyler JERKS Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Stop it. This is your pain -- your
dialog: burning hand. It's right here. Look
dialog: at it.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I was going to my cave to find my
dialog: power animal.
scene_heading: SHOT OF THE INSIDE OF JACK'S FROZEN ICE CAVE. RESUME:
text: Tyler JERKS Jack's hand again. Jack re-focuses on Tyler...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Don't deal with this the way those
dialog: dead people do. Deal with it the way
text: a living person does.
text: SHOT OF INSIDE THE ICE CAVE - ON MARLA, LYING NAKED UNDER A
text: FUR COAT, TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK TOWARDS US. RESUME:
text: Jack tries to pull his hand free. Tyler won't let go.
text: Jack's eyes glaze over again. Jack speaks, whiny from pain:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I... I think I understand. I think
dialog: I get it...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: No, what you're feeling is premature
dialog: enlightenment.
scene_heading: SHOT OF A GREEN FOREST WITHOUT RAIN. RESUME:
text: Tyler SLAPS Jack's face, regaining his attention...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This is the greatest moment of your
dialog: life and you're off somewhere,
dialog: missing it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, I'm not...
text: SHOT OF TREES ENGULFED BY A FOREST FIRE. RESUME:
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Shut up. Our fathers were our models
dialog: for God. And, if our fathers bailed,
dialog: what does that tell us about God?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know...
text: SHOT OF EMBERS POURING FROM THE HELLISH FOREST FIRE. RESUME:
text: Tyler SLAPS Jack's face again...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Listen to me. You have to consider
dialog: the possibility that God doesn't like
dialog: you, he never wanted you. In all
dialog: probability, He hates you. This is
dialog: not the worst thing that can happen...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It isn't... ?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We don't need him...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We don't... ?
scene_heading: SHOT OF INSIDE ICE CAVE - NAKED MARLA PULLS JACK DOWN ON TOP
scene_heading: OF HER - JACK KISSES HER - CIGARETTE SMOKE COMES FROM HER
scene_heading: MOUTH - JACK COUGHS. RESUME:
text: Jack is a wide-eyed zombie...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... Marla ... ?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Fuck damnation. Fuck redemption. We
dialog: are God's unwanted children, with no
dialog: special place and no special
dialog: attention, and so be it.
text: Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes. Jack does his best
text: to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled
text: knot. He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You can go to the sink and run water
dialog: over your hand. Look at me. Or you
dialog: can use vinegar to neutralize the
dialog: burn, but first you have to give up.
dialog: First, you have to know that someday,
dialog: you are going to die. Until you know
dialog: that, you will be useless.
text: Jack spasms with a shiver of pain...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You ... you don't know what this
dialog: feels like, Tyler.
text: Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand.
text: Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes. Tyler grabs a bottle
text: of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound.
text: Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Congratulations. You're a step
text: closer to hitting bottom.
scene_heading: INT. BARNEY'S - DAY
text: Jack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed-
text: over, wait as a BUYER fills out forms.
dialog: There are bars of "The Paper Street Soap Company" soap on
text: the counter. Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get
text: arrested. His hand is BANDAGED.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Tyler sold the soap to department
dialog: stores at twenty bucks a Ear. God
dialog: knows what they charged. How ironic.
dialog: We were selling rich women their own
text: fat asses back to them.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer,
text: smoking a cigarette. Boss enters.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
text: He was wearing a yellow tie. It must
dialog: be Thursday. I didn't even wear a tie
dialog: to work anymore.
text: Boss slaps a piece of PAPER down on Jack's desk.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: "The first rule of fight club is you
dialog: don't talk about fight club."
text: Jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I must've left the original in the
dialog: copy machine.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: "The second rule of fight club...
dialog: Is this yours?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hmm?
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: You don't get paid to abuse the copy
dialog: machine.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: "Abuse" the copy machine. There's an
dialog: image.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: Pretend you're me. You find this.
dialog: What would you do?
text: Jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Me? I'd be very careful who I talked
dialog: to about this. It sounds like
dialog: someone dangerous wrote it... someone
dialog: who might snap at any moment,
dialog: stalking from office to office with
dialog: an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas
text: semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round
dialog: after round into colleagues and co-
dialog: workers.
text: Jack moves very close to Boss, picks up the PAPER and starts
dialog: tearing it into pieces.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Might be someone you've known for
dialog: years... somebody very close to you.
dialog: Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing
dialog: me every little piece of trash you
dialog: pick up.
text: Jack puts the PAPER in his trash. Bass stares with a tinge
text: of outrage, a tinge of fear. PHONE RINGS. Jack answers it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Compliance and Liability.
speaker_heading: MARLA'S VOICE
dialog: My tit's going to rot off.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Just a second.
dialog: (to Boss; smiles)
dialog: Could you excuse me? I need to take

text: Boss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: INTERCUT WITH - CLOSE UP OF MARLA...
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Would you do something for me? I
dialog: need you to check and see if there's

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know ...

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: MARLA

speaker_heading: MARLA

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah, both of us.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You know about the guy who invented
dialog: it? I hear all kinds of things.
dialog: Supposedly, he was born in a mental

scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WKREHOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Thank you. Thank you.
text: Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're welcome.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Fight club -- this was mine and

dialog: for review...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
text: Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's pretend. You're the Department
dialog: of Transportation, and you discover
dialog: that our company intentionally did
dialog: nothing about leather seats cured in
dialog: third world countries with chemicals
dialog: we know cause birth defects? Brake
dialog: linings that fail after a thousand

speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: Just who the fuck do you think you
dialog: are?! Get out! You're fired!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What about this? Keep me on payroll
dialog: as an outside consultant. In
dialog: exchange for my salary, I'll keep my

text: Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.
speaker_heading: BOSS
dialog: You little fucker! I oughta...
text: Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose. Blood starts to trickle.
text: He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by

text: SHATTERS the glass. He falls to the floor.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge.
text: Jack gets back to his feet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Please... don't hit me again, please.

speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
text: Under and behind and inside
dialog: everything this man took for granted,
dialog: something horrible had been growing.
text: Jack crawls high enough to grab Boss's belt, hoisting

text: blood from his face onto the knuckles of Boss's hand.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Please... please...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: And right then, at our most excellent
dialog: moment together...

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Forty-eight airline flight coupons.
dialog: Plus... hold on... just a minute...

speaker_heading: JACK

text: An enthusiastic RUMBLE from the crowd.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Shut up! Which means a lot of you

dialog: waiting tables; or they're slaves
dialog: with white collars.
dialog: (more)
speaker_heading: TYLER (cont)
dialog: Advertisements have them chasing cars
dialog: and clothes, working jobs they hate
dialog: so they can buy shit they don't need.
dialog: We are the middle children of
dialog: history, with no purpose or place.
dialog: We have no great war, or great
dialog: depression. The great war is a
dialog: spiritual war. The great depression
dialog: is our lives. We were raised by
dialog: television to believe that we'd be
dialog: millionaires and movie gods and rock
dialog: stars -- but we won't. And we're
dialog: learning that fact. And we're very,
dialog: very pissed-off.
text: The crowd erupts into a DEAFENING CHORUS of agreement. Jack
text: looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We are the quiet young men who listen
dialog: until it's time to decide.
text: A fat, MIDDLE-AGED MAN stomps down the stairs, pushing into
text: the crowd, followed by a TALL, HEFTY THUG who holds a GUM.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: FAT MAN (LOU)
dialog: Who am I?! There's a sign on the
dialog: front that says "Lou's Tavern." I'm
dialog: fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Tyler Durden.
text: Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou SLAPS it away.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Who told you motherfuckers you could
dialog: use my place?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Irvine? Irvine's at home with a
dialog: broken collarbone.
text: Everyone glances guiltily at each other.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: He don't own this place, I do. How
dialog: much money's he getting for this?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: There is no money.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: It's free to all.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Ain't that something?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Yes, it is.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone
dialog: outta here now!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You're welcome to join our club.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Did you hear what I just said?!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You and your friend.
text: Lou SLUGS Tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: You hear me now?
text: Tyler gains his breath, determined. He looks up, turns his
text: head, looking to Jack. Jack watches, wide-eyed.
text: Tyler straightens, facing Lou.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
text: Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face. Some of the guys move
text: forward, but the Thug points his gun. Jack-runs forward
text: anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face.
text: More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We really need to use this place.
text: Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his
text: face, his stomach. Tyler collapses to the floor. Lou
text: starts KICKING his. Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: That's it.... that's good. Get it
dialog: all out. You'll feel better.
text: Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more. Finally,
text: sweating, bewildered, Lou stops. He looks to the Thug, who
text: is just as bewildered.
text: Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and
dialog: this whole fucking world...
text: Tyler's blood spatters on Lou. Lou tries to shake Tyler
text: off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE. The Thug grabs Tyler
text: and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou. Lou
text: slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood. Tyler
text: spits and shouts through clenched teeth...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You don't know where I've been.
text: Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor. Tyler rubs his
text: bloody face into Lou's face. The Thug lifts Tyler. Tyler
text: clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We need this place. We need it.
dialog: Please let us keep it, please...
text: Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Pleeeeeease!
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Okay! Okay, fuck it! Use the
dialog: basement! Get off me!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We need some towels, Lou. We need
dialog: replacement light bulbs.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Alright, Christ! Fucking let me go!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Thank you. Thank you, sir...
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Let go of me!!
text: Tyler lets go of Lou's belt. Lou scrambles away. The Thug
text: drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood. Lou gets to
text: his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys. He
text: and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind.
text: Fight club surrounds Tyler. They help him up, move him to
text: a crate. Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his
text: breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs
text: and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This week, each of you has a homework
dialog: assignment. You're going to go out
dialog: and start a fight with a total
dialog: stranger...
dialog: (pause, drooling blood)
dialog: You're going to start a fight... and

speaker_heading: YUPPIE
dialog: Hey! Wha... What the hell... what
dialog: are you doing?! Who are you?!!
text: The Yuppie backs away. Ricky follows...
speaker_heading: YUPPIE
dialog: Get away from me! Keep away!
dialog: NO... !

speaker_heading: YUPPIE

dialog: me... ?!
text: Having no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows.
scene_heading: EXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY

text: These men continue on their way.
text: The Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who
text: looks down, stunned.
speaker_heading: SEMINARIAN
dialog: You... you did that on purpose!
dialog: The Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian. The Seminarian grabs
text: the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it. The Mechanic
text: shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH.
text: The Mechanic purposely takes it. The Seminarian starts to
text: run away. The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the
text: Seminarian in the back of the neck. They fight.
scene_heading: INT. RECORD STORE STOCKROOM - NIGHT
text: A FIST smashes a JAW. Guys CHEER. An arm snakes around a

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Hey.
text: Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table. Tyler
text: comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Go on in. We're celebrating.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers. Tyler does NOT
text: follow. BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in
text: front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed
text: in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: You are not your job.
speaker_heading: OTHERS TOGETHER
dialog: You are not your job.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: You are not how much money you have
dialog: in the bank.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Shhhh, wait... they're back to it...
text: Bob goes to turn up the TV. One guy, sixteen years old with
text: an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack.
speaker_heading: ANGEL FACE
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Great, thanks.
text: Angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Shhhhh! Watch!
text: Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the "PARKER
text: MORRIS BUILDING." The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE
text: PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames
text: pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water.
speaker_heading: REPORTER (V.O.)
dialog: Police Commissioner Jacobs has just
dialog: arrived... just a second... excuse
dialog: me, Commissioner, could you tell us
dialog: what you think has happened?
text: COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera.
speaker_heading: COMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.)
dialog: We believe this is related to the
dialog: recent acts of vandalism around the
dialog: city. It's some kind of organized
dialog: group, and we are coordinating a
dialog: rigorous investigation.
text: Jack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him. Tyler
text: tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What did you guys do?
text: They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER. They look at Jack and shake
text: their heads. Jack doesn't get it. Suddenly, the guys'
text: faces turn to stone. Bob sits rigid.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: The first rule of Project Mayhem
dialog: is... you do not ask questions.
text: Jack stares at them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: A luxurious BANQUET. Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne.
text: He rises and starts out of the room. Jack, in a WAITER'S
text: UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB...
text: RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Jacobs saunters down an empty hall. He stops to check his
text: tie in a mirror. He pushes open the door of the MEN'S
text: BATHROOM -- face to face with TYLER.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Tyler GRABS Commissioner Jacobs, pulling him into the
text: bathroom. He slaps a piece of tape over Jacobs' mouth. The
text: OTHER "WAITERS" rush in. Jack stays back to keep the door
text: shut. Tyler and the others hold Jacobs, pulling down his
text: pants. Bob snaps a rubber band -- reaches to Jacob s crotch.
speaker_heading: TYLER
text: Wrap it around the top of his hackie-
dialog: sack.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Man, his balls are ice cold.
text: Ricky produces a KNIFE, moves it down to Jacob's testicles.
text: Jacobs is bug-eyed. Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You're not going to continue your
dialog: "rigorous investigation." You will
dialog: publicly state that there is no
dialog: underground group. Or -- imagine,
dialog: the rest of your life with your
text: scrotum flapping empty.
speaker_heading: JACOBS
dialog: (mouth taped)
dialog: ... no... please, no...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We'll send one to the New York Times
dialog: and one to the Los Angeles Times.
dialog: Press release style. Your nuts will
dialog: be bicoastal. Understood? The
dialog: people you're after are everyone you
dialog: depend on.
dialog: (more)
speaker_heading: TYLER (cont)
dialog: We do your laundry, cook your food
dialog: and serve you dinner. We guard you
dialog: while you sleep. We drive your
dialog: ambulances. Do not fuck with us.
text: Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife, causing Jacobs to
text: JUMP -- Ricky holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - LATER
text: Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back SERVICE
text: ENTRANCE. Tyler gives Angel Face a hearty slap on the back.
text: Angel Face smiles at Tyler, nods, grinning.
text: Jack sees this, his eyes narrowing, stops walking.
scene_heading: INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Fight club in full swing. Jack battles Angel Face, BEATING
text: the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I felt like putting a bullet between
dialog: the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't
dialog: screw to save its species.
text: The crowd shouts maniacally, save Tyler, who watches with an
text: inscrutable stone face.
text: Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack POUNDS too hard. Blood
text: flies. The crowd begins to grow QUIETER.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I wanted to open the dump valves on
dialog: oil tankers and smother all the
dialog: French beaches I'd never see.
text: Finally, Angel Face lies still, unconscious. Jack stops,
text: stares down, numb. Jack walks away -- the crowd parts to
text: let him pass. Jack scans faces... finds Tyler.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I felt like destroying something
dialog: beautiful.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET NEAR LOU'S TAVERN - LATER
text: RAINING. Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.
text: A idling car HONKS. Tyler leads Jack toward it. A bruised-
text: faced VALET PARKER thrown keys to Tyler, but Jack intercepts.
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: There you are, Mr. Durden. Airport
dialog: parking, long term.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (motions to car)
dialog: After you, Mr. Durden...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: No... after you.
scene_heading: INT. STOLEN CAR
text: Tyler gets in the driver's seat. Jack gets into the front
text: passenger seat. Ricky and the mechanic are in back.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Tyler pulls the stolen car away from the curb. It has two
text: bumperstickers: "RECYCLE YOUR ANIMALS" and "MAKE MINE VEAL."
scene_heading: INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER
text: RAIN GUSHES down. Jack stews, silent. The car moves down
text: a HIGHWAY, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Something on your mind?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No.
text: Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why wasn't I told about "Project
dialog: Mayhem?"
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What should I have told you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why wasn't I involved from the
dialog: beginning? You and I started fight
dialog: club together.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Fight club was the beginning. Now
text: it's out of the basements and there's a
dialog: name for it -- Project Mayhem.
speaker_heading: RICKY AND MECHANIC
dialog: (together)
dialog: The first rule of Project Mayhem is
dialog: you do not ask questions.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This is as much mine as yours.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Is this a needlepoint club? Is it
dialog: about you and me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You know what I mean.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What do you want? A statement of
dialog: purpose... ?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Should I E-mail you? Should I put
dialog: this on your "action item list?"
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I want to know --
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What do you want to know about
dialog: Project Mayhem?
speaker_heading: RICKY AND MECHANIC
dialog: (together)
dialog: The first rule of Project Mayhem --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Ricky and Mechanic)
dialog: Shut up!!
dialog: (to Tyler)
dialog: I want to know what's going on.
text: Tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates...
text: Opposing HEADLIGHTS get closer fast...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This does not belong to us. We are
dialog: not the leaders. We are not special.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We are the all-singing, all-dancing
dialog: crap of the world. We are all part
dialog: of the same compost heap...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Tyler...
text: Tyler steers back into the proper lane. The other CAR flies
text: past, HORN SOUNDING...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What the hell ... ?!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You choose your level of involvement.
dialog: I won't make decisions for you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not asking you to.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You're asking questions that don't
dialog: have answers. You know just as much
dialog: about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't think that's true.
text: Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up.
text: Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Tyler... what is this... !
text: Jack fights	to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What will you wish you'd done before
dialog: you died?
speaker_heading: RICKY
text: Paint a self-portrait.
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Build a house.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: And you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know! Nothing!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: If you died right now, how would you
dialog: feel about your life?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I would feel nothing about my life?
dialog: Is that what you want to hear?!
text: The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS. It moves
text: to the other side of the road. Tyler steers there, too.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I want to hear the truth.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck
dialog: you and fuck Marla. I'm sick of
dialog: this. How's that?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Why do you think I blew up your condo?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Hitting bottom isn't a weekend
dialog: retreat! It's not a seminar! You
dialog: have to forget everything you know,
dialog: everything you think you know --
dialog: about life, about friendship, about
dialog: you and me.
text: Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his
text: hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the
text: wheel... the car swerves...
text: The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING.
text: Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air. Jack looks at
text: Tyler with dead eyes.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay, okay... fine...
text: Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air.
text: Tyler studies Jack face, impressed. Tyler makes no move to
dialog: take the wheel.
text: THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of
text: the road, surrounded by flares.
text: Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the
text: shoulder... heading for the stalled car. Their faces are
text: illuminated by the light of the flares. Tyler smiles.
text: They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE! The
text: back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass-
text: over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill...
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I'd never been in a car accident.
dialog: This must've been what all those
dialog: statistics felt like before I filed
dialog: them into my reports.
text: The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.
scene_heading: EXT. OVERTURNED CAR
text: Tyler crawls from the passenger side. He walks around...
text: opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the
text: mud. Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear
text: window. Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: We just had a near-life experience.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the
text: ceiling. Tyler sits in a nearby chair.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: In the world I see -- you're stalking
text: elk through the damp canyon forests
dialog: around the ruins of Rockefeller
dialog: Center. You will wear leather
dialog: clothes that last you the rest of
dialog: your life. You will climb the wrist-
dialog: thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears
dialog: Tower. You will see tiny figures
dialog: pounding corn and laying-strips of
text: venison on the empty car pool lane of
text: the ruins of a superhighway.
text: Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (leaving)
dialog: Feel better, champ.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jack sits at the table, sips coffee. He's pale, dazed,
text: seems broken. He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and
text: HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from.
text: Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the
text: counter. Her back is to Jack as he looks at her. She pours
text: ccffee and lights a cigarette. A beat of silence, then:
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: I'll be out of your way in a sec.
text: She seems to be as weak as Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You... don't have to... leave.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Really... I mean it.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Have you been going to your groups?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Chloe's dead.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Do you care?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: It was the smart move on her part.
text: Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face.
text: There's a BRUISE on her ARM. Jack gets up, moves closer.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why are we both... caught up like
dialog: this... with... ?
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I came so close to saying Tyler's
dialog: name, I could feel it vibrate inside
dialog: my mouth.
text: Marla looks a him, waiting.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I don't understand. Why does a weak
dialog: person have to go out and find a
dialog: strong person... to hang onto?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: What do you get out of it?
text: Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING. Jack can't quite
dialog: figure where it's coming from.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You hear that?
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Hear what?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That... sawing and hammering.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Have we been talking too long? Must
dialog: we change the subject?
text: Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door,
text: Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (harsh whisper)
dialog: You're not talking about me, are you?
text: Jack reacts, turns back to Marla.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Marla and Tyler)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: That day you came over to my place to
dialog: play doctor... what was going on
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (still a whisper)
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Marla and Tyler)
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Nothing? I don't think so.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: This conversation...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: This conversation...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: ... is over.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... is over.
text: Marla comes to touch Jack's hair. Jack closes the basement
text: door. Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his
text: hand. Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: What is this? Who did this?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... A person.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Guy or girl?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why would you ask if it's a guy or a
dialog: girl?!
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Why would you get bent if I asked?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let go of me...
dialog: (pulls his hand free)
dialog: Leave me alone.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: You're afraid to say.
text: Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with
text: frustration. She leaves out the back door, not looking back.
text: Jack leans against the wall. After a moment, he opens the
text: basement door, heads downstairs...
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT STAIRCASE
text: Tyler walks upstairs, passing as Jack continues down...
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack looks around. TRIPLE-DECKER BUNKS clutter the
text: basement, as many as can fit into the space.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (calling upstairs)
dialog: Tyler... ? What's this for?
text: From upstairs, the SOUND of the DOORBELL.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jack opens the door. Ricky stands on the porch, staring
text: ahead in subordinate military style. He's in black pants,
text: black shirt, black shoes, holds a PAPER BAG, with an army
text: surplus MATTRESS rolled-up at his feet.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Um... what can I do for you, Ricky?
text: Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You're too young. Sorry.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wait a minute...
text: Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: "Too young?"
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: If the applicant is young, we tell
dialog: him he's too young. Old, too old.
dialog: Fat, too fat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: "Applicant?"
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: If the applicant waits at the door
dialog: for three days without food, shelter
dialog: or encouragement, then he can enter
dialog: and begin training.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: "Training?" Tyler...
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets,
text: unsure. Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Uh, look. You're too... young to...
dialog: train here. You should probably be
dialog: on you way.
text: No response from Ricky, who remains at attention. Jack goes
text: back inside. Tyler closes the door.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
text: Ricky remains at attention. Jack bursts out with a BROOM,
text: knocks the brown bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it away.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Are you deaf?! I told you to leave!
dialog: You will never get inside this house!
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - MORNING
text: Ricky's still there. Tyler comes out, friendly.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Look, friend, I'm sorry for the
dialog: misunderstanding. It's not the end
dialog: of the world. Just go away. You're
dialog: trespassing and I will call the
dialog: police. Nothing personal.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
text: Ricky, same spot. Jack bursts outside with the broom again.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're never getting through this
dialog: door, you stupid little weasel! Look
dialog: at me when I talk to you... !
text: He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder with the broom.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What is your major malfunction!?
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: At the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the
text: PORCH below.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Sooner or later, we all became what
dialog: Tyler wanted us to be.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - MORNING
text: Ricky's there. Bob is now next to him, in black, with a
text: paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet. Tyler steps out.
text: Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob. To all the
dialog: following questions, Ricky answers "Sir!" --
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You have two black shirts? Two pair
dialog: black trousers? One pair black
dialog: boots? Two pair black socks? One
dialog: black coat? Three hundred dollars
dialog: personal burial money? Go inside.
text: Ricky goes in. Tyler turns to Bob.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You're too old. Sorry. And, you're
dialog: too fat. Nice seeing you.
text: Bob looks genuinely hurt. He picks up his mattress and
text: starts away. Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes. Jack
dialog: follows Bob...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Bob... Bob, wait...
dialog: (leading Bob back)
dialog: Let me explain this to you...
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
text: CRICKETS CHIRP. Bob stands at at rigid attention.
scene_heading: INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
text: Tyler and Jack stand in bathroom doorway, watching Ricky
text: finish SHAVING off all of his HAIR. Tyler comes to give the
text: top of Ricky's head a sharp SLAP.
speaker_heading: TYLER
text: A monkey, ready to be shot into
dialog: space. A Space Monkey, ready to
dialog: sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem.
dialog: From here on, all those with shaved heads: "SPACE MONKEYS."
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - DAY
text: Jack looks out the window. Bob stands motionless. There's
text: another "applicant," a SHORT GUY, beside Bob. Ricky comes
text: out the front door with the BROOM...
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: (to Bob)
dialog: You're too fucking old, fatty! We
dialog: don't want your kind here!
dialog: (to short guy)
dialog: You're too short. Go away, stumpy!
dialog: Go back to the circus!
text: Ricky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: So it went...
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
text: Tyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the
text: square of backyard. They pull weeds, clear rocks; working
text: with shovels, rakes, etc. They cart away WHEELBARROWS of
text: rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Tyler built his army.
text: IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack keeps watching out the window, eats toast.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: To what purpose, might one ask?
dialog: Well, one might ask, if not for the
dialog: first rule of Project Mayhem.
text: Jack turns to look around the kitchen. THREE SPACE MONKEYS
dialog: work -- one SCRUBBING the FLOOR, one WASHING DISHES, one
text: SCRUBBING the walls. Jack walks out.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: In Tyler We Trust.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY
text: Jack opens his eyes, awakening to sunlight thru the window.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: And, then...
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY
text: Jack slowly pushes open the door to Tyler's room...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Tyler...
text: The room is empty. Jack stares.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: He was gone.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Jack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Jack enters. Space Monkeys render fat and make soap. They
text: pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix. They add VODKA. Off
text: to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE. On the
text: wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's
text: LICENSES; a sign above it: "HUMAN SACRIFICES."
scene_heading: FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
dialog: "You are not a beautiful and unique
dialog: snowflake. You are the same decaying
dialog: organic matter as everything else.
dialog: We are all part of the same compost
dialog: heap."
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: Planet Tyler.
text: Jack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly.
scene_heading: FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
dialog: "We are the all-singing, all-dancing
dialog: crap of the world."
text: Jack picks up a BOTTLE of VODKA.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I had to hug the walls, trapped
dialog: inside this clockwork of Space
text: Monkeys, cooking and working and
dialog: sleeping in teams.
scene_heading: INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Jack enters, vodka in hand. TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: The house became a living thing, wet
dialog: inside from so many people sweating
dialog: and breathing. So many people
dialog: moving, the house moved.
text: Jack walks out.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
text: Jack enters. Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart.
text: Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS. Walls are
text: lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under
dialog: SIGNS: "Mischief," "Disinformation," "Arson."
text: Jack's eye lingers on "Arson." He starts flipping through
text: a file. Angel Face comes to take the file from him.
speaker_heading: ANGEL FACE
dialog: That wouldn't interest you.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where's Tyler?
speaker_heading: ANGEL FACE
dialog: The first rule of Project --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right, right.
text: As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE-
text: BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT
text: Jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes. In the BACKGROUND, a
text: Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM. It's a
text: ritual; no words. Other Space Monkeys tend the garden.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I'm all alone. I Am Jack's Broken
dialog: Heart.
text: Jack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it. A
text: Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Get away from me!
speaker_heading: MARLA'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Who are all these people?
text: Jack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The Paper Street Soap Company.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Can I come in?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He's not here.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He's not here! Tyler's not here
dialog: anymore! He's gone away!
text: Marla stares at Jack, miserable. A tear runs down her
text: cheek. She turns and walks away. Jack watches her go.
text: There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING.
text: Jack heads to the back door...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Jack enters. Ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to
text: the LEG. Space Monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating
text: the wound. Other Space Monkeys carry in a DEAD BODY in
text: BLACK CLOTHES and SKI MASK, putting it on the table.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's going on?
text: Space Monkeys stare at the body. The Mechanic, sweating,
text: gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse --
text: it's BOB, with a gunshot wound to the HEAD.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Bob... oh, Christ...
text: Jack pushes past a Space Monkey, stares down, stricken...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What... what happened... ?
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: We were on assignment...
scene_heading: EXT. SCULPTURE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

dialog: I can't explain. You wouldn't
dialog: believe me anyway. I'm trying to
dialog: protect you...
text: Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races
text: past. Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Let go of me!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do this for me, Marla. Do this for
dialog: me, if you never do anything else...
text: Jack spots a BUS idling further up the street.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Leave me alone! I don't ever want to
dialog: see you again!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll
dialog: never have to see me again.
dialog: (digs in his pocket)
dialog: Here... here...
text: He pulls MONEY from his pocket, holding it out.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Take this money, get on this bus...
dialog: (pointing to bus)
dialog: Get on, and I promise you, I'll never
dialog: bother you again, if that's what you
dialog: want. Please...
text: Marla looks at Jack, numb.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Tyler...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm begging you. Get on the bus.
dialog: Get on the bus.
text: Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus. As
text: they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I can't let myself see where you're
dialog: going. Go wherever it takes you,
dialog: remember... keep away from major
dialog: cities...
text: Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one
dialog: last look at Jack.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: (holds up the money)
dialog: I'm not paying this back. I consider
dialog: it "asshole tax."
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes, fine. Just, get on. Stay away
dialog: a couple of weeks, at least.
text: Jack's still covering his eyes. Marla gets on the bus.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Tyler...
text: Jack finally looks to her.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: You are the worst thing that ever
dialog: happened to me.
text: DOORS HISS SHUT. The BUS LEAVES, heading away. Jack seems
text: relieved. Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA...
text: Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is
text: filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys.
text: Jack SPRINTS after the bus...
text: The bus speeds away. Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla.
text: Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Son of a bitch!
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: Jack RUNS to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of
text: files on the desk in front of the DESK SERGEANT...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: I want you to arrest me. I'm the
dialog: leader of a terrorist organization
dialog: responsible for acts of vandalism all
text: over the city. Detective Stern in
dialog: arson knows who I am...
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER
text: Detective Stern and THREE DETECTIVES stand, staring at Jack,
text: who's seated. On the table are the phone bill and files.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There are probably several hundred
dialog: members in the metropolitan area.
text: Chapters are sprouting in at least
dialog: five other major cities. They're
dialog: tightly-regimented, with many cells
dialog: capable of operating without a
dialog: central leader. Check this address:
dialog: 1537 Paper Street. You'll find the
dialog: body of Robert Paulson buried in the
dialog: garden. You'll also find numerous
dialog: tubs used to make gallons of
dialog: nitroglycerin. The plan, I believe,
dialog: is to blow up these credit card
text: headquarters and the TRW building.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Why these buildings?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You are not your job. You are not
dialog: how much money you have in the bank.
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: (to other detectives)
dialog: Keep him talking.
text: Stern leaves. A beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile
text: at Jack with REVERENCE.
speaker_heading: FLAT-TOP DETECTIVE
dialog: I really admire what you're doing.
dialog: You're a brave man to order this.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: REDHEAD DETECTIVE
dialog: You're a genius, sir.
text: They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table.
text: Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife.
speaker_heading: BALD DETECTIVE
dialog: You know the drill. You said if
dialog: anyone ever tries to interfere with
dialog: Project Mayhem, even you, we got to
dialog: get his balls.
text: Flat-Top PULLS Jack's pants completely off, tosses them
text: aside. Jack SCREAMS. Flat-Top holds his legs.
speaker_heading: FLAT-TOP
dialog: It's useless to fight.
speaker_heading: REDHEAD
dialog: This is really a powerful gesture,
dialog: Mr. Durden. It'll set quite an
dialog: example.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No... you're making a mistake!
speaker_heading: FLAT-TOP
dialog: You told us you'd say that.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not Tyler Durden!
speaker_heading: BALDY
dialog: You told us you'd say that, too.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm
dialog: ordering you to abort the mission!
speaker_heading: FLAT-TOP
dialog: You said you would definitely say
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: BALDY
dialog: What's our best time for a "cut and
dialog: run?"
speaker_heading: FLAT-TOP
dialog: Four minutes.
speaker_heading: BALDY
dialog: Is somebody timing this?
speaker_heading: REDHEAD
dialog: (looks at his watch)
dialog: Wait till the second hand gets to the
dialog: twelve.
text: A KNOCK at the door. Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's
text: mouth. He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy
text: opens the door a crack. Stern mutters:
speaker_heading: STERN
dialog: Some of this info checks out. Let's
dialog: go to the place on Paper Street.
text: Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing
text: the door. The two remaining Detectives continue. Jack kicks
text: and screams and writhes. The Detectives wrangle him, but
text: with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone.
speaker_heading: REDHEAD
dialog: (checking his watch)
dialog: Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up
dialog: the time!
text: Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards --
text: Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls. Redhead lets go of one of
text: Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting
text: off the airway. Jack's face reddens... he's choking...
text: Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN
text: and points it at him. Redhead backs off. Jack gets up,
text: gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises.
text: Jack grabs one of the files off the table.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
text: Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK
text: DOOR. He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand,
text: looking like a complete madman. Cars almost hit him.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER
text: Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads
dialog: toward the BUILDING with the address "1888."
speaker_heading: EXT. 1888 LOBBY
text: Jack tries the door. Locked. He lifts a cast iron bench,
text: runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass. The bench
text: immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin!
text: Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package.
text: Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass...
scene_heading: INT. 1888 LOBBY
text: Jack pushes through the broken glass. He sprints for the
dialog: "PARKING" door...
scene_heading: INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING
text: Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS. He bolts to the STAIRS...
scene_heading: INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR
text: Jack enters, heaving. Again, NO CARS. He moves from one
text: SUPPORT POST to another, searching. He finally spies,
text: across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED.
text: Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic. He walks around it.
text: There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"...
text: Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside..
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Could be worse...
text: Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You could be standing under 37
text: stories of steel and concrete with a
dialog: 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped
dialog: to the support... oh, maybe it
dialog: couldn't be...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (points at bomb)
dialog: You... you can't be serious about
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What a ridiculous thing to say.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I can't let you...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: ...go through with this?
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm going to...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: ...stop me?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm not going...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: ...to let this happen!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stop finishing...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: ...your sentences! They're
dialog: our sentences. Get your mind around
dialog: that.
text: Tyler gets up walks to Jack.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What are you doing running through
dialog: the streets in your underpants? We
dialog: both use that body.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Since when is Project Mayhem about
dialog: murder?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: The buildings were evacuated thirty
dialog: minutes ago. Everything's proceeding
dialog: exactly as planned.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You don't know that. There could
dialog: still be people inside.
text: Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Maybe. Maybe a couple of guys with
dialog: shaved heads couldn't synchronize
dialog: their watches. Good riddance.
text: Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his
text: face. He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I wouldn't be doing that. Unless you
dialog: know which wires, in what order...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If you know, I know.
text: Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go
text: through the tangle of colored wires.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I
dialog: spent the whole day thinking about
dialog: the wrong ones.
text: Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This is not about martyrdom.
text: Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm pulling the green wire.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Green? Did you say green?
text: Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look,
text: seems genuinely concerned.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Don't pull the green wire. Pull
dialog: anything but the green wire.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I'm serious. That's the wrong one.
text: Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers
text: trembling. The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Hear that? Marla's here. Just in
dialog: the nick of time, eh?
text: Jack looks to Tyler. Tyler points towards the SOUND...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: See for yourself.
text: Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand,
text: keeps an eye on Tyler. Jack looks over the railing...
text: BELOW, a BUS idles. The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out,
text: kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: You motherfuckers...
text: They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE.
text: Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I've got everything. The bombs. The
dialog: army. I've got Marla.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Bob is dead, Tyler. The police blew
dialog: a hole in his head. Was that part of
dialog: your plan?
text: Tyler thinks, shrugs.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Bob was a grown man. In any great
dialog: struggle, there will be casualties.
dialog: Wouldn't that be implicit in the
dialog: name? Project "Mayhem."
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Fuck your struggle. I want out.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You want out?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I quit.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Not an option, for the most obvious
dialog: of reasons. You need to get with the
dialog: program.
dialog: (looks at his watch)
dialog: Seven minutes. Let's get out of here.
text: Tyler's walks away. Jack looks at the gun in his hand. He
text: points the gun at Tyler...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Tyler...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (still walking away)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (COCKS the gun)
dialog: Defuse the bomb.
text: Tyler stops walking.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Ask me nicely.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Defuse the bomb, please.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Defuse the bomb?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yes.
text: Tyler strides towards the BOMB. Jack trains the gun...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Please.
text: Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it. He grips the
text: GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS.
text: Jack lowers his gun.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I did that for you. As a gesture.
dialog: Now, how fast can you run? There are
dialog: ten other bombs, in ten other
dialog: buildings in the immediate area. If
dialog: you're going to get them all, you
dialog: better get cracking.
dialog: (looks at watch)
dialog: Six minutes. Green wires, remember.
dialog: I'll be upstairs.
text: Jack's stunned. Tyler walks across the parking garage, past
text: Jack, heading for the STAIRS.
text: Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES!
text: Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding...
text: Tyler spins to face Jack.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Whoa! What was that all about?
dialog: Jack aims... FIRES!
text: Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE.
text: Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the
text: post... Tyler is NOT THERE. Jack turns, takes slow steps,
text: moving the gun from side to side...
text: Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face.
text: Jack falls. The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor...
text: Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE. Jack looks to the gun,
text: scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun...
text: Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling.
text: Jack rolls, holding his chest. He looks up, sees Tyler run
text: into the STAIRWELL. Jack grabs the gun and follows...
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL
text: Jack smashes the door open. The stairwell's empty. Jack
text: RUNS up a flight of stairs, kicks open ANOTHER DOOR...
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LOBBY
text: Jack steps forward, gun up... TWO INTERLOCKED HANDS SLAM
text: down onto his head. Jack drops to the floor.
text: Tyler backs away, laughing. Jack gets to his feet, aims his
dialog: gun...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Fire at will.
text: Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler.
text: Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect. Tyler raises his arms.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What did you expect?
text: Jack charges. Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of
text: Jack's hand. They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking
dialog: each other to the floor...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Banks of SECURITY MONITORS sit unmanned.
text: ON ONE MONITOR: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor,
text: alone, wrestling himself. He swings his left hand up,
text: punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- PUNCHING
text: himself in the side of the head...
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LOBBY
text: Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied. Tyler manages to
text: get his hands around Jack's throat, starts BANGING Jack's
text: head against the floor...
speaker_heading: SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.
text: ... Jack's got his hands around his own throat, BANGING his
text: own head against the floor, over and over...
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LOBBY
text: Jack manages to break Tyler's grip, KICKS Tyler away.
text: Tyler springs to his feet, RUNS, heading for a STAIRCASE.
text: Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows...
text: ON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the
text: lobby, disappears around a corner. Jack's right behind,
text: turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE.
text: Jack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head. He
text: wheels. Tyler isn't there. A TAP on his shoulder. Jack
text: turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face. Jack falls
text: against the loft railing. Tyler comes forward, SWINGS...
speaker_heading: SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.
text: Jack PUNCHES himself square in the nose!
scene_heading: INT. MAIN LOBBY
text: Jack's dazed. Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward,
text: SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS...
text: Jack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head
text: on the floor. Jack PASSES OUT...
speaker_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR
text: CLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE. He
text: looks around, trying to focus his eyes...
text: JACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from
text: where his body was dragged across to where he is how.
text: CLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend. He turns his head --
text: TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S
text: MOUTH. Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes...
speaker_heading: PULL BACK TO:
text: Tyler is seated in Jack's lap. Tyler holds the gun in
text: Jack's mouth, his arm around him. This huge room is being
text: remodeled. Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling
text: windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY.
text: Tyler looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: One minute.
speaker_heading: JACK (V.O.)
dialog: I think this is about where we came
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (looking out window)
dialog: This is the beginning. We're at
dialog: ground zero. Maybe you should say a
dialog: few words, to mark the occasion.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
text: Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (still distorted)
dialog: I still can't think of anything.
text: Tyler checks his watch.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: It's getting exciting now.
text: Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Look what we've accomplished.
dialog: (checks watch)
dialog: Thirty seconds.
dialog: (looks out windows)
dialog: Out these windows, we will view the
dialog: economic collapse. One step closer
dialog: to global equilibrium. I'm glad
dialog: you're here with me.
text: Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (distorted)
dialog: Can't you call it off... ?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: It's out of our hands.
dialog: (looks at watch)
dialog: This is it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Fifteen seconds now. Can you see
dialog: alright? 10... 9... 8....
text: Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS,
text: excited. Jack closes his eyes, despairing.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: 5... 4... 3... 2...
text: Out the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged. Nothing. A
text: long beat. A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face.
text: Jack opens his eyes. More waiting. Tyler looks genuinely
text: surprised, pissed-off.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What the fuck -- ?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Paraffin.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the
dialog: nitro with paraffin. I saw it
text: floating in the bomb.
dialog: (more)
speaker_heading: JACK (cont)
dialog: They must've run out of cotton and
dialog: Epsom salt. Paraffin is iffy at best.
text: Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts
text: pacing. Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Damn it! God-damn it...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not exactly according to plan.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Do we have to do everything
dialog: ourselves?!
text: Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust. He reaches
text: into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.
speaker_heading: TYLER
speaker_heading: (into WALKIE TALKIE)
dialog: ... Codename Rooster. Passcode First
dialog: Strike...
text: Jack's eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: NO...
speaker_heading: TYLER
speaker_heading: (into WALKIE TALKIE)
text: Proceed with remote detonation.
text: Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler. The GUN is knocked away. Jack
text: STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles
dialog: off...
text: Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it. Tyler's getting to
text: his feet, sees the gun, annoyed. Jack stands.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Haven't we already done this?
text: Jack SHOOTS TWICE. Bullets pass right thorough Tyler.
text: Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the
text: floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: How'd you do that?! You're a fucking
dialog: figment of my imagination... you're
dialog: psychogenic fugue state...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Fuck that, maybe you're my
dialog: hallucination.
text: Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet. There's no walkie-
text: talkie there. Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE
text: CRUSHED under his own foot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh... Christ...
text: Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why... why... why... ?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Why what?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why can't I get rid of you? Why
dialog: can't I just wish you away?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You need me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, no, I don't.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I thank you, I really do. Thank you,
dialog: but I don't need you anymore.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Look, I can be selfish, I know that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm not blind to my own failings...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Noooo, please...
text: Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: From now on, we'll share Marla.
dialog: We've been spending too much time
dialog: apart...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: ... no, no, no...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: No more running off without you.
dialog: From here on out, we do it together.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why are you doing this?!
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I'm doing this for us.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Please understand... I've gotten all
dialog: I can from this, Tyler.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: (sullen)
dialog: If I leave, you will be right back
dialog: where I found you...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I swear on my life, I won't...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: You will. You know you will.
text: Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head. He
text: looks at the gun in his hand...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Can you live with that?
text: Jack stares at the gun a long time... then...
text: Jack brings the gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH.
text: Tyler cocks his head.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What have you left for me?
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Why do you want to do that? Why do
dialog: you want to put that gun in your
dialog: mouth?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not my mouth. Our mouth.
dialog: Tyler is calm.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: This is interesting.
text: Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands
dialog: very close to Jack.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: Why are you going with this, Ikea-
dialog: boy?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's the only way to get rid of you...
text: Jack COCKS the hammer on the gun.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: I can see you feel very strongly. I
dialog: feel strongly too.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Hey, you and me.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Friends again?
text: Their eyes are locked, unblinking. Long silence.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Do something for me.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Appreciate something.
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Look at me...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: My eyes are open.
scene_heading: EXTREME SLOW MOTION:
text: Jack's finger squeezes the trigger...
text: KABLAM! -- Jack's cheeks INFLATE with gas. His eyes bulge.
text: BLOOD flies out from his head. The WINDOW behind him
text: SHATTERS. SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts.
text: RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack...
text: Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...
speaker_heading: TYLER
dialog: What's that smell... ?
text: Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls...
text: Tyler hits the ground. The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN
text: OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.
text: Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room,
text: moving forward to Jack. TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.
speaker_heading: TALL SPACE MONKEY
dialog: Are you all right, sir... ?!
text: Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole
text: blown in his CHEEK. He's bleeding hard, but he's alive.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm okay...
text: Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to
text: see. TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla. One holds a gun
text: to Marla as she struggles.
speaker_heading: SHORT SPACE MONKEY
dialog: Are you sure? You look terrible,
dialog: sir! What's happened?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Everything's fine.
scene_heading: ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY
dialog: Sir, you look really awful! Do you
dialog: need medical assistance?
text: Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Bring the girl to me. The rest of
dialog: you get out. Now!
text: The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: What happened... ?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Don't ask.
text: Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply.
text: them to Jack's wound. Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.
speaker_heading: JACK
