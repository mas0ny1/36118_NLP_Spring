speaker_heading: FADE IN:
speaker_heading: 1	EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)	 1
text: A vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of light appears and starts
text: moving toward the camera. A small and distant cylindrical object
dialog: tumbling end over end, but we can't determine exactly what it is yet.
scene_heading: 2	EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY2
text: A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware that there are two
text: heads sticking out of the stalks of wheat: two men standing and looking
text: up at the sky. As we move towards them, we can see that the two men are
text: SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: (points to sky)
dialog: There he is- there, to the south!
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: (peers upward)
dialog: What are ye, blind? That's a bird.
text: As they stare up at the sky
speaker_heading: 3	EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)	 3
text: The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and we can now see
text: that it is a bottle of some sort, and it is tumbling directly toward the
dialog: camera.
scene_heading: 4	EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY4
text: As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: (concerned)
text: Repelling the Crystalline Trench, rafting down lava flows, orbital
text: skydiving.It's like the man is running a bloody decathlon across the
dialog: galaxy.
text: Suddenly we hear a double sonic boom.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: That should be him now. I think he's just crossed the sound barrier.
text: They shield their eyes against the sun and look up.
speaker_heading: 5	EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)	 5
text: The bottle gets closer.
scene_heading: 6	EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY6
text: A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute lands in the wheat flat
text: on his back. His body-suit is charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still
text: curling off it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack and
text: boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man removes his helmet. It is
text: KIRK. He smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a
dialog: rollercoaster.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Right on target! I jump out over the Arabian Peninsula and I end up
dialog: here, right on the dime.
text: Kirk gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters
dialog: (points)that way.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Thanks for pointing that out.
text: Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden pain in his back.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a
dialog: look at it.
text: Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his harness.
speaker_heading: 6A	 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)	 6A
text: The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see that it is a
text: champagne Bottle- Dom Perignon, 2265. Follow the bottle as it tumbles
dialog: through space.
scene_heading: 6B	 EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY6B
text: Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out
dialog: over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start
dialog: re-entry.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening
dialog: ceremony.
text: This strikes a nerve with Kirk- we see a flash of hesitation and
text: irritation cross his face.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I'm not going (beat) Scotty, help me with this chute.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I
dialog: meant it.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: Captain=8A
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (firm)
dialog: I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
speaker_heading: 7	EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)	 7
text: The champagne bottle smashes onto the bow of a Federation starship
text: (Excelsior class) sitting in its dock in orbit around Earth.
speaker_heading: 7A	 EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)	 7A
text: Follow the shards of glass from the bottle as they spread over the ship,
text: revealing the name on the hull: U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-B.
scene_heading: 8	ANGLE ON SPACEDOCK WINDOW	8
text: A large picture window overlooking the starship in its berth. The window
text: is filled with people in Starfleet uniforms, applauding the christening
dialog: of the ship (but we hear nothing).
scene_heading: 8A	 INT. SPACEDOCK OBSERVATION ROOM (VFX-I) 8A
text: The people are still applauding and we can see that they are looking out
text: over the ship in its berth.
scene_heading: 8B	 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B IN SPACEDOCK (VFX-I) 8B
text: The great ship sits in spacedock.
scene_heading: 9	INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE	9
text: Close on a set of turbolift doors as they slide open to reveal Kirk,
text: Scotty and Chekov. A bright light shines into their faces and they
text: react. Move to reveal that the bright light is coming from a futuristic
text: camera with a small bank of lights attached to it. The camera is a
text: holographic recorder with two lenses and is worn on an operator's head.
text: There are four JOURNALISTS clustered in front of the turbolift- one
text: associated with the camera, the others using PADDs to make notations.
text: Also clustered around the door are the bridge crew of the
text: Enterprise-B.Everyone is applauding as Kirk and the others blink under
text: the bright lights and ENTER the Bridge.
speaker_heading: JOURNALISTS
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Captain Kirk, how does it feel to be back on the Enterprise Bridge=8A?
dialog: Captain, can I have a minute? Captain Scott, do you have any comment on?
dialog: Commander Chekov
text: CAPTAIN JOHN HARRIMAN pushes through the crowd.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: Excuse me, excuse me=8A there will be plenty of time for questions
dialog: later.
text: The journalists edge away, and the cameraman moves to get a good angle.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: (cont'd, to all)
dialog: I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: It's our pleasure.
text: Harriman is young, confident, eager. This is his first command and he
dialog: takes it very seriously.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: I just want you to know how excited we all are to have a group of living
dialog: legends with us on our maiden voyage. (beat) I remember reading about
dialog: your missions when I was in grade school.
text: The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him a look. Harriman
text: looks a little embarrassed- he didn't mean to insult them. But Kirk
text: gives him a little smile, lets it roll off.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Well, may we have a look around?
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: Please, please.
text: Chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to her.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: Demora!
text: Chekov moves off.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: (breezy)
dialog: So, Captain=8A this is the first starship Enterprise in thirty years
dialog: withoutJames T. Kirk in command. How do you feel about that?
text: The journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's eyes flash for
dialog: amoment- the longer he's on this Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't
text: feel good about it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Just fine. I'm glad to be here to send her on her way.
text: He tries to move away from the journalist, who dogs him.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: What have you been doing since you retired?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I've been keeping busy.
text: At this point, Chekov approaches with a young, mid-twenties, attractive,
text: Asian female Ensign named DEMORA.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: (to Kirk)
dialog: Excuse me, Captain. I'd like you to meet the Helmsman of the
dialog: Enterprise-B. Ensign Demora Sulu- Captain James Kirk.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. My father's told me some interesting
dialog: stories about you.
text: Kirk is shocked. For a long moment, he stares at her in amazement.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Your father? Hikaru Sulu is your father?
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: You met her once before, but she was
text: Chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short height.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: Twelve years, sir.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Yes, well, congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise
text: without a Sulu at the helm.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: Thank you, sir. (to Chekov) Let me show you the new inertial guidance
dialog: system.
text: Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them for a long beat.
text: The expression on his face changes from shock to sadness. Something is
text: clearly bothering him. Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: (to Kirk)
dialog: Damn fine ship if you ask me.
text: But Kirk's mind is still on Demora. He watches her as she moves to the
dialog: Helmsman's position.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: And what would that be, sir?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the
dialog: time.
text: Kirk nods absently. Scotty realizes something.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: So, that's why you've been running around the galaxy like an
dialog: eighteen-year-old. Finding retirement a little lonely, are we?
text: Kirk gives him a look.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: With that kind of tact, I'm glad you're an engineer and not a
dialog: psychiatrist.
text: Harriman interrupts.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Oh, of course.
speaker_heading: 10	 NEW ANGLE	10
text: Revealing that three chairs have been neatly arranged to one side.
text: Scotty, Kirk and Chekov all take their seats. The journalists take
text: positions on the opposite side of the Bridge. Harriman moves to the
text: command chair and the rest of the Bridge crew go to their stations.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: (to all)
text: Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and
dialog: starboard at station keeping. (beat) Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you
dialog: would give the order to get underway.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, no. Thank you.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: Please, I insist.
text: All eyes on Kirk- he has little choice. He stands uncomfortably. There
text: is a moment of anticipation.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (to all)
dialog: Take us out.
text: Everyone breaks into applause. Kirk sits down in acute embarrassment and
dialog: annoyance.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Very good, sir.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: (sotto)
text: Brought a tear to my eye.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 11	 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)	 11
text: The great ship majestically leaves the dock and heads out into open
text: space,passing directly overhead.
scene_heading: 12	 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE	12
text: A short time later. Harriman turns to his guests.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: Well, we've just cleared the asteroid belt. Our course will take us
text: outbeyond Pluto and then back to spacedock. Just a quick run around the
dialog: block. (beat) If we have time, we'll conduct a few tests of the warp-
text: Suddenly the communications console starts to beep. The COM OFFICER hits
text: a few commands in response.
speaker_heading: COM OFFICER
dialog: (to Harriman)
dialog: We're picking up a distress call, Captain.
text: This grabs everyone's attention.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: On speakers.
text: We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked and urgent.
speaker_heading: COM VOICE
dialog: (fritzed)
dialog: This is the transport ship Lakul. We're caught in some kind of
dialog: energydistortion. We can't break free... need immediate help... it'
dialog: tearing us-
text: The voice is drowned out by static. The SCIENCE OFFICER checks something
text: on his console. The journalist with the holo-camera turns on his light
text: and pans it around to capture the action.
speaker_heading: SCIENCE OFFICER
text: The Lakul is one of two ships transporting El-Aurian refugees to Earth.
text: Harriman blinks a couple of times, surprised at this unexpected turn of
text: events. Kirk watches him intently. Harriman clears his throat, then
text: turns to Demora.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: Can you locate them?
speaker_heading: DEMORA
text: The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We
dialog: don't even have a full crew aboard.
text: The NAVIGATOR checks his console.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
dialog: We're the only one in range, sir.
text: The holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he shifts in his seat,
text: hesitant to take the plunge. Kirk is drumming his fingers impatiently on
text: his leg. Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his jacket a
dialog: bit.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: Well, then, I guess it's up to us. (to Demora) Helm, lay in an intercept
dialog: course and engage at maximum warp.
text: Kirk fidgets in his chair, itching to get in on the action- his
text: instincts taking over. Scotty shoots him a side-long glance.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Is there something wrong with your chair, Captain?
text: Kirk gives him a look.
scene_heading: 13	 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)	 13
text: The ship snaps into warp.
scene_heading: 14	 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE	14
text: A few minutes later. Demora is watching her console.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
text: On screen.
speaker_heading: 15	 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)	 15
text: Which now shows a huge ribbon of crackling energy directly ahead of the
text: Enterprise-B. Everyone reacts to the bizarre sight.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: (off console)
dialog: I've found the transport ships.
speaker_heading: 15A	INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)	 15A
text: The viewscreen now shows two transport ships trapped like insects in the
text: violent torrent of energy. The ships are being buffeted and thrown about
text: by large tendrils of crackling energy.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: (cont'd)
text: Their hulls are starting to buckle under the stress- they won't survive
dialog: much longer.
text: The ship suddenly shakes. The Navigator works his console.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
dialog: We're encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy
dialog: ribbon.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: We'll have to keep our distance. We don't want to get pulled in, too.
text: Harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out what to do. Kirk can
text: barely contain himself- to him the answer is obvious. He blurts out the
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Tractor beam...
text: Scotty quickly elbows him in the side- this isn't Kirk's ship. Kirk
text: shuts up.Harriman glances at Kirk.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: We don't have a tractor beam.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: It won't be installed until Tuesday. (beat) Ensign Sulu, try generating
text: a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: Aye, sir.
text: When Kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly and mouths the
text: word "no" under his breath. He knows that won't work.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: There's too much quantum interference, Captain.
text: Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another solution, but it
text: isn't easy- it's his first day in command; his ship is under-manned and
text: ill-prepared. It's a nightmare come true. Kirk is itching to get in on
text: this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair- but he restrains
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: What about=8A venting plasma from the warp nacelles? That might disrupt
text: theribbon's hold on the ships.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
dialog: Aye, sir. Releasing drive plasma.
text: A tense beat. Harriman glances over at the journalists, then glances
text: over at Kirk. Kirk goves him a pained smile, trying to be encouraging
text: even though he knows this is not the right course of action.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
dialog: It's not having any effect, sir. I think-
speaker_heading: DEMORA
text: Sir! The starboard vessel's hull is collapsing.
speaker_heading: 15B	INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)	 15B
text: Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed by a fiery
text: tendril of energy and it explodes. The other ship continues to be thrown
text: about and buffeted. Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge.
speaker_heading: >>> CHEKOV
dialog: How many people were aboard that ship?
speaker_heading: DEMORA
text: Two hundred sixty-five.
text: >>> Harriman pales at the sight, seems shell-shocked by the struction
text: of the ship. He's overwhelmed now; at a genuine loss as to what to do
dialog: next.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: The Lakul's hull integrity is down to twelve percent, sir.
text: Harriman looks over at Kirk, who has remained quiet during this entire
text: sequence only through great effort and out of deference to the young
dialog: captain. This is a delicate moment- Harriman doesn't want to look
text: incapable, but at the same time, he needs help.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: Captain Kirk, I would appreciate any suggestions you might have.
text: Kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle. He moves down to
text: stand next to Harriman.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: First, move us within transporter range and beam those people to the
dialog: Enterprise.
text: Harriman looks at him with surprise.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
text: Kirk gives him a supportive look. Harriman buckles down and grimly looks
text: at the image on the screen.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
text: Helm, close to within transporter range.
text: Kirk glances at the cameraman, who's still shining the light on them
dialog: all.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: And second, turn that damned thing off.
text: The cameraman turns off the light.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 16	 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)	 16
text: The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon. The tendrils from
text: the ribbon lash out at the ship, just missing it.
scene_heading: 17	 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE	17
dialog: As before.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: We're within range, sir.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: (to lieutenant)
dialog: Beam them directly to Sickbay.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: How big's your medical staff?
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: (embarrassed)
text: The medical staff doesn't arrive until Tuesday.
text: Chekov turns to the two journalists.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: You and you. You've just become nurses. Let's go.
text: Chekov and the journalists EXIT to the turbolift.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
text: Main Engineering reports fluctuations in the warp plasma relays.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: Bypass the relays and go to auxiliary systems.
text: The LIEUTENANT is having problems at the aft console.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Sir, I'm having trouble locking onto them. They appear to be in some
dialog: sort of temporal flux.
text: Kirk turns to Scotty.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Scotty?
text: Scotty quickly moves to look at the transporter console.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: What the hell...
text: Kirk moves to him.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Phasing? To where?
text: Scotty begins to work.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATOR
dialog: Sir! Their hull's collapsing!
scene_heading: 18	 EXT. SPACE- THE LAKUL (VFX-I) 18
text: The ship is destroyed by an energy tendril.
scene_heading: 19	 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE	19
text: All eyes on Scotty.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: I got forty-seven of them (beat, grim) out of one hundred fifty.
text: Suddenly the ship is rocked violently. Klaxons and alarms start to wail
text: and the lights flicker on and off. A bulkhead explodes, sending metal
text: fragments screaming across the Bridge and killing the Navigator. Scotty
text: quickly takes over the dead man's console.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Report!
speaker_heading: DEMORA
text: We're caught in a gravimetric field emanating from the trailing edge of
dialog: the ribbon.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: All engines, full reverse!
scene_heading: 20	 EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B & RIBBON (VFX-I)	20
text: The ship is turning sideways into the wake of the ribbon, but cannot
text: break away. It is clearly being pulled along, out of control. Tendrils
text: leap up from the ribbon, lashing against the ship.
scene_heading: 21	 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- SICKBAY	 21
text: The room is filled with the survivors of the Lakul. They are all members
text: ofthe El-Aurian race- humanoid and dressed in distinctive clothing. The
text: survivors are in various states of shock. Many sit on the floor, staring
text: into middle distance. Some lie on tables, unconscious. Others are
text: mumbling incoherently to themselves. Chekov and the journalists are
text: moving from person to person trying to get control of the situation as
text: the ship is rocked and flung about. Chekov has a tricorder.
speaker_heading: SURVIVORS
dialog: (incoherent, overlapping)
text: The colors are touching me. I'm caught in the glass. Help me...I can see
dialog: the seconds...Over here...
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: It will be all right. We're going to take care of you.
text: He looks at the tricorder.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: (off tricorder)
dialog: Only minor injuries so far. (beat) But it looks like they're all
text: suffering from some kind of neural shock.
text: One journalist moves past a man sitting on a biobed with a dazed look on
text: his face. He has a nasty looking wound on one side of his face. (We will
dialog: learn later that this man is named DOCTOR SORAN.)
text: The journalist is about to turn away when suddenly Soran grabs him
text: roughly- clearly a man of great strength- and pulls him close. Soran's
text: eyes are suddenly wild, crazed.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: Why, why?
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: It's all right. You're safe=8A you're on the Enterprise.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: No, I have to go... I have to get back. You don't understand! Let me go!
text: Soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he can do any real
text: damage, Chekov injects Soran with a hypospray and Soran falls
dialog: unconscious.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: What was he talking about?
text: Suddenly a woman with her back toward us stumbles nearby. Chekov quickly
text: grabs her arm and catches her before she falls.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: Easy there...
text: The woman turns around and we see her face for the first time- it's
text: GUINAN. She seems dazed and confused. Chekov smiles at her warmly.
speaker_heading: CHEKOV
dialog: It's going to be okay. Here, just lie down.
text: As he guides Guinan onto a table
scene_heading: 22	 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE (VFX-I)	22
text: Energy ribbon on viewscreen.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
text: Inertial dampers failing.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Engines not responding!
text: Harriman is gripping the arms of his chair with one hand. His face
dialog: pales.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: I didn't expect to die my first day on the job.
text: Kirk tries to buck up the young captain.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death. (beat, then
dialog: louder) Scotty?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: Hull integrity failing.
text: Kirk looks at Scotty expectantly for a moment.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: (cont'd)
dialog: But I do have a theory...
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I thought you might.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field
dialog: long enough for us to break away.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: A photon torpedo?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Aye.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (quickly, to Demora)
dialog: Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
text: Demora turns to him.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: Captain, we don't have any torpedoes.
text: Kirk glances at Harriman.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Don't tell me...Tuesday.
text: Harriman nods, a little embarrassed. The shaking gets worse.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a
text: resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (onto the idea)
dialog: Where are the deflector relays?
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
speaker_heading: HARRIMAN
dialog: (to Kirk)
dialog: I'll go. You have the Bridge.
text: Harriman heads for the turbolift, and there is a moment as Kirk is
text: sorely tempted to take command of the ship and sit in the Captain's
text: chair one more time. But he pulls himself back before Harriman can exit.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No=8A a captain's place is on the Bridge of his ship. (beat) I'll take
dialog: care of it.
text: Harriman nods in acknowledgement. Kirk heads for the turbolift.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (on the move, to Scotty)
dialog: Keep her together until I get back.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: I always do.
text: Kirk smiles as the turbolift doors slide shut.
speaker_heading: 23	 OMITTED 23
scene_heading: 24	 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- CORRIDOR	24
text: Kirk running down the corridor, opens a door.
scene_heading: 25	 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- DEFLECTOR ROOM (CONTINUOUS)25
text: A small control room with a few consoles. Kirk rushes in and rips off
text: one of the large wall panels. He quickly begins to re-route cabling and
dialog: circuitry.
scene_heading: 26	 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE	26
text: As before. The ship is shaking badly.
speaker_heading: DEMORA
dialog: Forty-five seconds to structural collapse!
text: Scotty is working the consoles frantically.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Bridge to Captain Kirk.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT:
scene_heading: 27	 INT. ENTERPRISE-B- DEFLECTOR ROOM	27
text: Kirk working furiously.

text: toward the side, where a long plank is being pushed out over the water.
speaker_heading: CREWMEMBERS
dialog: Into the sea with him. Feed him to the sharks! Walk the plank!
text: Picard gives Riker a questioning look.

dialog: Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
speaker_heading: RIKER
dialog: When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the

dialog: Picard shrugs it off- it's not exactly his cup of tea, but he'll go
dialog: along with it.
text: Worf is hustled to the rail where CRUSHER is waiting patiently by the

text: Worf finally stops and turns around
speaker_heading: WORF

scene_heading: 52	 INT. OBSERVATORY- OPS CENTER (VFX-P)52
text: The station is a smoking ruin- consoles flickering, lights dim, damage
text: everywhere. Only a few minutes have passed since they were attacked.
text: Riker, Worf, Crusher and two SECURITY GUARDS materialize. They're all
text: back in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons. Worf has a tricorder
text: and Crusher has a medical kit. The room is cramped, there are fallen
text: bulk-heads and blown- out consoles. The debris makes it difficult to get
text: a clear view of the room.
speaker_heading: WORF
text: These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
speaker_heading: RIKER
dialog: Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
text: Crusher follows her tricorder readings.
speaker_heading: CRUSHER
dialog: I'm picking up lifesigns...about twenty meters ahead.
speaker_heading: WORF
dialog: That rules out Klingons.
text: Riker gives him a look.
speaker_heading: WORF
dialog: They would not have left anyone alive.
speaker_heading: CRUSHER
dialog: Over here.
text: They pick their way carefully through the carnage of the station and
text: come to the body of a Starfleet science officer. He has taken a
text: disruptor blast to the back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on
text: his uniform. Crusher immediately takes some devices out of her medical
text: kit and begins to treat him.
speaker_heading: RIKER
dialog: Worf, you're with me. Paskall, you and Mendez search the upper deck.
text: The security guards climb a nearby ladder while Riker and Worf head
text: down a dimly-lit corridor. Riker stops at two bodies in the hall, checks
text: them over- but they're dead. There is a sudden banging from the far
text: corner of the room. Worf and Riker quickly move to a collapsed bulkhead.
speaker_heading: WORF
dialog: Under here.
text: They both grab hold of a large metal plate, pull it aside and begin to
text: dig through the debris. Finally, a hand can be seen grasping about from
text: within the pile of rubble. Riker and Worf work faster. Worf grabs the
text: man's hand.
speaker_heading: WORF
dialog: It's all right. Do not struggle.
text: Worf holds the man's hand as Riker shoves away a final console. We
text: reveal the head and torso of Doctor Soran, one of the survivors from the
text: Lakul (and last seen in Sickbay aboard the Enterprise-B). Soran has not
text: aged at all over the years but he does have a permanent scar on his face

speaker_heading: LA FORGE
dialog: Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
speaker_heading: DATA

speaker_heading: LA FORGE

speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Doctor Soran?
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
text: The men skake hands and Picard sits down. Soran is an imposing physical

speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Nothing for me. (brusque, to Soran) I understand there's something
dialog: urgent you need to discuss with me.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a
dialog: critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
text: Picard's reaction is a little impatient- this doesn't sound that
dialog: imperative to him.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once
dialog: we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow
dialog: scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed
dialog: within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me...
text: Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently but firmly grabs
text: him by the arm. The unexpected physical contact and the change of
text: intensity in Soran's face stops Picard in his tracks.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: (cryptically)
dialog: They say time is the fire in which we burn, and right now, Captain, my
dialog: time is running out. (beat) We leave so many things unfinished in our
dialog: lives- I'm sure you can understand.
text: For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord within Picard.
text: He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks for a long moment.
text: When he finally speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
text: Picard walks away without a word before Soran can thank him. Soran looks
text: after him with relief, then pulls out an antique pocket watch and opens
text: it. He looks at the watch for a long moment, then snaps it closed and
text: head for the opposite exit from the one Picard took. Follow Soran across

speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: As you may or may not be aware, I am an El-Aurian. Some people call us a
dialog: race of "listeners". We listen. (beat) Right now, Mr. La Forge, you have
dialog: my undivided attention. I want to listen to everything you know about
dialog: trilithium- and me.
dialog: La Forge thinks.
speaker_heading: LA FORGE
dialog: Trilithium is an experimental compund developed by the Romulans. I think
dialog: it's a derivative of-
text: Soran picks up the PADD from the desk and activates it. Suddenly
text: something small, with sharp edges, can be seen moving just underneath La
text: Forge's skin near his chest. La Forge moves his hand to the spot, but
text: then the protrusion is suddenly gone.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for
dialog: trilithium. Why?
speaker_heading: LA FORGE
dialog: I was ordered to by the Captain.
text: On the PADD in Soran's hand, we can now see an interior graphic of La
text: Forge's body sitting in the chair. The graphic is interactive, moving as
text: La Forge moves. A blinking dot represents the movement of the probe
text: inside his body. Right now, the dot is in the middle of his chest.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall
dialog: we? You have information and I need it. (beat) Did the Captain explain
dialog: his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
speaker_heading: LA FORGE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
speaker_heading: LA FORGE
dialog: Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
text: On the PADD, we now see the dot has moved to a position next to La
text: Forge's heart. Soran looks up at La Forge.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: My instincts tell me you're lying. And I know that can't be easy for
dialog: you. (off PADD) I can see you have a good heart.
text: Soran taps a control on the PADD. Suddenly La Forge grabs his chest in
text: pain. Soran watches La Forge for a few seconds, then taps the PADD
text: again. La Forge gasps and starts to breathe.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a
dialog: nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your
dialog: cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left
dialog: ventricle. (smiles) A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
speaker_heading: LA FORGE
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity,
dialog: didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten
dialog: minutes before the onset of brain damage?
speaker_heading: LA FORGE
dialog: No, I didn't know that.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: We learn something new about ourselves every day. (beat) Now. Maybe I
dialog: didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly
dialog: what Captain Picard knows.
speaker_heading: LA FORGE
dialog: I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
text: Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly. For a moment, he looks
text: genuinely compassionate- and it's a disturbing contrast to his usual
dialog: dark intensity.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge. (beat) Let's try thirty seconds.
text: Soran taps a control on the PADD. La Forge gasps and strains against an
dialog: unimaginable pain.

scene_heading: 84	 INT. STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY (VFX-P)	 84
text: A room filled with exotic-looking devices, sensors and computers which
text: handle the enormous task of tracking the ship's position in space. The
text: monitors around the room display various diagrams of the energy ribbon
text: (as seen in the beginning of the film).
text: Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great deal of
text: complex information on the screen. Picard is standing next to him.
text: Throughout the following, Data seems distracted and preoccupied.
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy
dialog: which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: When is it expected back?
text: Data doesn't answer right away.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Data?
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass
dialog: through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
text: Picard moves about the room. He's frustrated, tired, but determined to
dialog: find out what's going on.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true,
dialog: then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
speaker_heading: DATA
text: The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within
text: this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the
dialog: energy ribbon.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which
dialog: has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
speaker_heading: DATA
text: It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
text: Data works the computer and then the computer begins to work. Data
text: sighs- his expression becomes downcast and gloomy. He sits down and puts
text: his head in his hands. Picard finally has to say something.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Data, are you all right?
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am
dialog: overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on
dialog: the observatory.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not
dialog: expect. (beat) I believe it was fear.
text: Picard regards him sympathetically.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have
dialog: to learn to deal with.
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my
dialog: friend. (beat) Does that make me a coward?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another
dialog: emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: (considers)
dialog: Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
speaker_heading: 84A	ANGLE (VFX-P) 84A
text: The computer finishes its calculations and the console beeps. Data works
text: the console. Information appears on screen.
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa
dialog: star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have
dialog: increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a
dialog: course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to
dialog: increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational
dialog: forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will
dialog: have to make a minor course correction.
text: Picard is starting to get an idea, he's onto something here. He moves to
text: a large table in the center of the room.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: (musing)
dialog: A minor course correction. (beat) Where is the ribbon now?
speaker_heading: 84B	ANGLE (VFX-P) 84B
text: Data moves to the table to work. After a few beats, an elaborate map of
text: the galaxy springs up on the ceiling of the room. A blinking dot shows
dialog: the position of the ribbon.
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: This is its current position.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Can you project its course?
text: Data hesitates, still obsessed with his own emotional turmoil. Picard
dialog: finally has to lay down the law.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: (firm)
dialog: Data. I have nothing but sympathy for what you're going through. But
dialog: right now, I need your full attention on the task at hand. If you can't
dialog: provide it, then I'll have to relieve you of duty until Doctor Crusher
dialog: can remove this emotion chip of yours. I'm sorry, but you leave me no
dialog: other choice.
text: This snaps Data back. He considers this for a long moment, then looks
dialog: determined.
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: I do not wish to remove the chip, sir. Although these emotions are
dialog: proving difficult to deal with, I cannot imagine going back to a life
dialog: without them. I have taken an important step toward becoming truly
dialog: human. If I were to turn back now... (beat) I would like to continue in
dialog: my duties, sir.
text: Picard smiles at him.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Courage is an emotion too, Data. (beat) Now, can you project the course
dialog: of the ribbon?
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: I believe so.
speaker_heading: 84C	ANGLE (VFX-P) 84C
text: Data works the console. A red line moves to form an arc through the
text: starfield. Picard examines the display for a moment and nods. He's
text: excited, on to something.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Enhance grid A-9.
text: Data works and the display now zooms into a single sector. The red line
text: cuts through the sector.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Where was the Amargosa star?
text: Data works. A star is highlighted near the red line.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered,
dialog: could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: I believe so.
speaker_heading: 84D	ANGLE (VFX-P) 84D
text: Data works and holographic display changes again. The red line
text: representing the course of the ribbon now shifts to the right- away from
text: the Amargosa star's position. Picard is beginning to realize what's
dialog: going on.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: That's what Soran's doing, he's changing its course. (beat) But why? Why
dialog: try to alter its path? Why not simply fly into it with a ship?
text: Data thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: Our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has
dialog: either been destroyed or severely damaged.
text: Picard thinks about this, then has a flash of insight.
speaker_heading: PICARD
text: He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to
dialog: him. (beat) Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: (works)
dialog: Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
speaker_heading: 84E	ANGLE (VFX-P) 84E
text: The display zooms in on a star very close to the ribbon's path. We now
text: see a solar system with a single star and four planets. The red line
text: moves directly through the system- it passes very close to the third
text: planet. Picard eyes that planet and points to it.
speaker_heading: PICARD
text: It's very close to Veridian III, but not close enough.
text: Picard's mind is going a mile a minute. He suddenly has a horrible
dialog: realization.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Data, what would happen to the ribbon's path if he destroyed the
dialog: Veridian star itself?
speaker_heading: 84F	ANGLE (VFX-P) 84F
text: Data works. On the display, the Veridian star suddenly darkens and goes
text: out. The red line shifts slightly until it makes an exact intersection
text: with the third planet. They both react to this sight. They're both aware
dialog: of just how serious this is.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: That's where he's going.
speaker_heading: DATA
dialog: It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would
dialog: produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: (grim)
dialog: And destroy every planet in the system.
text: Picard eyes the graphic with a sense of dread.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Are any of them inhabited?
speaker_heading: DATA
text: Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial

text: blinking. Picard now realizes that this image is not going to go away-
dialog: he can't hide from it.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: No, this isn't right. This can't be real.
speaker_heading: GUINAN'S VOICE
dialog: It's as real as you want it to be.
text: Picard turns to see
speaker_heading: 161	GUINAN (VFX-P)161
text: standing before him. She is wearing the same outfit seen in the
text: beginning of the film on the Enterprise-B. As they talk, the children
text: and the woman continue to move about their business as if Picard and
dialog: Guinan aren't there.
text: Picard is stunned.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: You're in the Nexus.
text: Picard looks around.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: This is the Nexus?
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: For you. This is where you wanted to be.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
text: Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on Guinan.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: I am on the Enterprise. I am also here. (off his puzzled look) Think of
dialog: me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Left behind?
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the
text: Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a
text: part of themselves behind.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Soran?
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: All of us.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Where is he now?
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: Wherever he wanted to be.
text: Guinan smiles at him.
speaker_heading: BOY'S VOICE
dialog: Papa, help me build my castle!
text: Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play castle out of the
text: 24th-century equivalent of Lego. For a moment, Picard is tempted to
text: drift back to the warm embrace of the fantasy.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: (to boy)
dialog: In a few minutes.
text: Picard looks around at the children, the lure to stay here becoming more
dialog: powerful.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: (continuing, awed, to Guinan)
dialog: These are my children...my children.
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go
dialog: forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Dinner's ready! Let's go!
text: There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room. The youngest boy
text: looks at Picard, goes over to him and takes his hand.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Papa, are you coming?
text: Picard looks down into the face of his child. His heart swells, the
dialog: temptation to stay here and live this out is profound. Almost in a
text: trance, he takes a few steps with the child toward the dining room. His
text: eye is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a moment;
text: he's torn between the two images. And then, in one of the most difficult
text: moments of his life, he bends down to the child.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Go on, go on without me.
text: The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then obeys his father and
text: dashes off toward the dining room to join the others. Picard straightens
text: up and tries to steel his voice.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: Why would you want to leave?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: (insistent)
dialog: Can I?
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: Yes, where would you go?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere,
dialog: any time.
text: Picard realizes the opportunity before him.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on
dialog: Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: What makes you think things will be any different this time?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: You're right. I'll need help. (beat) Guinan, will you come back with me?
dialog: Together, we could-
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
text: Picard looks crestfallen for a moment. Guinan gives him an enigmatic
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: GUINAN
dialog: I know just the guy.
text: Suddenly there's the cry of a hawk from o.s. Picard turns at the sound.
scene_heading: 162	EXT. KIRK'S HOME- DAY 162
text: Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but architecturally
text: striking house with spectacular views in the Canadian Rockies. A hawk is
text: circling overhead, making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is
text: cold, frigid- Picard can see his breath. Picard is just starting to
text: adjust to this sudden change in location when he hears the sound of wood
text: being chopped from around the corner of the house. Picard moves to look
text: around the corner and sees James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and
dialog: looks exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the Enterprise-B
text: at the beginning of the film. He is vigorously chopping wood with an
text: axe. He's enjoying himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual
dialog: labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's no trace of back
text: pain or any other ailment. Picard recognizes the famous captain- as
dialog: would any 24th-century Starfleet officer.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: James Kirk.
text: Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. His expression is
text: wondrous, almost child-like. Like in Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk
text: is immersed in the sensual feeling of the Nexus. It's like a dream that
text: has overpowered him.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Beautiful day, isn't it?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Yes, yes, it is.
text: Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Do you mind?
text: It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk wants him to put the
text: log on the chopping block for him.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Oh.
text: Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a vigorous chop
text: with the axe.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Captain, do you realize that-
text: But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Wait a second. I think something's burning.
text: Picard follows his look to see smoke billowing out of one of the windows
text: of the house. Kirk rushes into the house, and Picard follows.
scene_heading: 163	INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN- DAY- CONTINUOUS	 163
text: Kirk rushes in. The kitchen's decor is 19th-century with a few
text: 23rd-century touches- copper pans and an antique stove mixed comfortably
text: with computer consoles and Starfleet paraphernalia. Picard hesitates in
text: the doorway- a little unsure about rushing into some stranger's house.
text: Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove. It's very hot- he
text: quickly sets it down near the sink, waves the smoke away with his hand.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Looks like someone was cooking eggs. (to Picard) Come on in, it's all
dialog: right. This is my house- or at least it used to be, I sold it years ago.
text: Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's going on.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise.
text: Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique clock on a shelf chimes
text: as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock
text: in surprise and wonder- he is entranced by this experience, beginning to
text: connect with things and memories from his past.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: (pressing on)
dialog: I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
text: Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in his fantasy, he is
text: more interested in the sights and sounds around him. A dog barks from
text: o.c. They both look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets
dialog: Kirk with enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (affectionately)
dialog: Jake! Jake, you miserable old mutt. How can you be here? (to Picard)
dialog: He's been dead seven years.
text: Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we hear a WOMAN"S
text: VOICE from somewhere upstairs that stops Kirk in his tracks. As she
text: speaks, we can see the shock on Kirk's face.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA'S VOICE
dialog: Come on, Jim, I'm starving. How long are you going to be rattling around
dialog: that kitchen?
dialog: A beat.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: That's Antonia!
text: Kirk looks at the food on the stove. He's beginning to realize
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Wait a minute.
text: Kirk glances at Picard.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: The future.What are you talking about? This is the past.
text: Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a horseshoe with a tiny
text: red bow tied to it. This confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the
dialog: horseshoe.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: This is nine years ago, the day I told her I was going back to
dialog: Starfleet.
text: Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by memeories, sensations,
text: feelings. He goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with
text: a sudden burst of recognition.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: These were Ktarian eggs- her favorite. I was cooking them to soften the
dialog: blow. (re: horseshoe) And I gave her this.
text: Picard steps in.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: I know how real this must seem to you, but it's not. This isn't really
dialog: your house. We've both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus.
text: But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere. He's being swept away by the
text: emotion of the moment, realizing the opportunity he suddenly has.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Dill weed.
text: Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to it.
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: There's a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left, right
text: behind the nutmeg.
text: Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. He cracks open
text: two new eggs on the skillet and begins preparing a breakfast. Picard
text: waits for a moment, then goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and
text: hands it to Kirk.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: How long have you been here?
text: Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I don't know. I was on the Enterprise-B, in the deflector control
dialog: room...keep stirring these, will you?
text: Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a breakfast tray.
text: Picard is getting a little impatient, but stirs the eggs anyway.
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: The bulkhead in front of me disappeared, then I was out there chopping
dialog: wood. (back to stove) Thanks.
text: Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: History records that you died saving the Enterprise-B from an energy
dialog: ribbon eighty years ago.
text: But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk. He is thoroughly
text: enjoying himself and Picard is almost a distraction. Kirk begins serving
text: the eggs onto the plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
dialog: tray.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (amused)
dialog: So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you. (frowns at tray) Something's missing.
text: Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster- as if on cue,
text: two slices of toast pop out. Kirk grins and puts the toast on the
text: plates. Kirk picks up the tray and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Captain, I need your help. I want you to leave the Nexus with me.
text: Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows.
scene_heading: 164	INT. KIRK'S HOME- LIVING ROOM- DAY- CONTINUOUS164
text: Kirk and Picard both on the move. Kirk heading for a staircase.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: We have to go back to a planet called Veridian III and stop a man from
text: destroying a star. There are millions of lives at stake.
text: Kirk tries to keep it light, hoping this man will go away.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (hard)
dialog: I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when
dialog: your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy
dialog: owes me one (beat) I was like you once- so worried about duty and
dialog: obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the
dialog: end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
text: Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the stairs.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (looking up the stairs)
dialog: I'm going to walk up these stairs, march into that bedroom and tell
dialog: Antonia that I want to marry her.
text: Kirk begins to climb the stairs.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: This time things are going to be different.
text: He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind him. Picard glances
text: around the room in frsutration, then gets a determined look on his face
text: and marches up the stairs after Kirk, grasps the doorknob, opens it and
text: steps through the door into
scene_heading: 165	INT. BARN- DAY- CONTINUOUS	 165
text: Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway of a wooden barn.
text: Straw on the floor, farm implements on the walls, sunlight streaming in
text: through the slats. There are stalls in the barn with a few horses
text: visible. Kirk is standing a short distance away. He looks surprised as
text: well- and he is no longer holding his tray of food.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: (re: barn)
dialog: This doesn't look like your bedroom.
text: Kirk looks around for a moment, the pieces starting to fall into place.
text: He smiles with a growing realization.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: No, no, it's not. It's better.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Better?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
text: He points to a horse with a saddle on it.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (re: horse)
dialog: I took that horse out for a ride seven years ago, on a spring day.
text: Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a beautiful spring
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Just like this. If I'm right, this is the day I met Antonia.
text: He turns to Picard.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: This Nexus of yours is very clever. I can start all over again; do
dialog: things right from day one.
text: Kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and rides out of the
text: barn, filled with excitement. Picard watches him for a moment, then
text: looks at one of the other horses in the barn. He makes a decision and
text: then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 166	EXT. COUNTRYSIDE- DAY (VFX-P) 166
text: Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside and across a stream,
text: through a thicket of trees, and finally out onto a rolling plain. There
text: is a large ravine up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He spurs
text: his horse faster toward the ravine. The horse is tearing along, comes up
text: to the edge of the precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side.
text: Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse on. But as he
text: rides, we begin to see a change come over him- a look of doubt crosses
text: his face. Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot, and then
text: to a complete stop. He sits there for a moment and frowns, turns and
text: looks back at the ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something
text: about that jump is nagging at him.
text: He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. The horse breaks
text: into a gallop, racing back toward the ravine. Kirk grips the reins tight
text: in his hands and then the horse makes the leap across yet again.
text: This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an immediate stop. We
text: can see on his face that something is very wrong. He turns and stares at
text: the ravine with a mixture of shock and sadness on his face.
text: In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a horse of his own.
text: He stops next to Kirk. There is a long, quiet moment as the two men sit
text: there side by side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
dialog: feelings.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (re: ravine)
dialog: I must have made this jump fifty times, and every time it scared the
dialog: hell out of me. But not this time. (beat) Because it's not real.
text: A quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular hill in the
text: distance, shading his eyes against the bright sun. Picard follows his
text: gaze and we can now see the distant figure of a woman walking her horse.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: (re: woman)
dialog: Antonia?
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (nods)
dialog: She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
text: All euphoria is now gone from Kirk. It's a moment of self-revelation. He
text: glances around.
speaker_heading: KIRK
text: It's kinda like orbital skydiving. Exciting for a few minutes, but in
dialog: the end, you haven't really done anything. You haven't made a
dialog: difference.
text: Kirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard. And in a way, he's truly seeing
text: him for the first time.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Close to retirement?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: I hadn't planned on it.
dialog: There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't seen until now.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Well, let me tell you something- don't. Don't let them promote you.
dialog: Don't
dialog: let them transfer you. Don't let anything take you off the bridge of
dialog: that ship. (beat) Because while you're there, you can make a difference.
text: The two captains face each other for a moment. Picard hears what Kirk is
dialog: saying but also knows that's not the whole story. Picard gives him a
text: direct look, and there is something in Picard's eyes- a glint of resolve
dialog: and determination.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: You don't need to be on the bridge of a starship. Come with me. Help me
dialog: stop Soran. (beat) Make a difference again.
text: A long, silent beat as Kirk considers Picard. And slowly, unexpectedly,
text: a smile spreads across his face.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of
dialog: that planet=8A Veridian III?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: You could say that.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: (musing)
dialog: Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational,
dialog: illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
text: And for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his eye that tells us
text: Jim Kirk is back.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Sounds like fun.
text: The two men turn and walk away from Antonia, and as they walk, a roar of
text: color and sound washes out the screen, as seen before.
speaker_heading: FADE TO RED
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 167	EXT. MOUNTAINTOP- DAY (VFX-P) 167
text: Soran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing Picard.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, I have an appointment with eternity
dialog: and I don't want to be late.
text: We realize we are watching the same events play out again.
text: Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding toward the top of the
text: rockface. Picard drops to the ground on his back and begins to wriggl
text: underneath the forcefield. Picard accidentally touches the field.
speaker_heading: 167ASORAN (VFX-P) 167A
text: turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then draws his weapon.
text: Soran quickly fires at Picard.
speaker_heading: 167BTHE GROUND (VFX-P)	 167B
text: is blasted apart, creating a cloud of dirt and smoke, obscuring Picard
text: and the whole area momentarily.
text: Soran jumps down one level on the scaffolding, his disruptor still
text: in his hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived. Soran peers
text: through the cloud of dust and debris.
text: The dust from the explosion finally clears but Picard is gone along with
text: several feet of the ground where he was crawling.
speaker_heading: 167CSORAN (VFX-I) 167C
text: glances up at the sky and sees the distant energy ribbon just coming
text: into view. There's no time to look for Picard. Soran begins to climb the
text: scaffolding. Suddenly a boot kicks him in the head.
speaker_heading: 168	REVEAL KIRK	168
text: who is attacking Soran in Picard's place. The two men begin to fight.
speaker_heading: 169	NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)	169
text: as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up onto the control
text: platform and desperately begins trying to shut down the launcher.
dialog: The following happens very quickly:
text: *Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal.
text: *Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense of it all. It
text: won't respond. The control panel is bizarre and confusing- many
text: different screens and alien graphics. The alien countdown continues to
dialog: race by.
speaker_heading: 169ATHE SKY (VFX-I) 169A
text: the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer.
speaker_heading: 169BTHE MOUNTAINTOP 169B
text: Soran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it to the ground.
text: There's a struggle for the weapon.
text: Picard looks helplessly at the control panel. Nothing he does has any
text: effect. He keeps hitting buttons, looking for other control panels,
dialog: anything to affect the launcher.
speaker_heading: 169CANGLE (VFX-P) 169C
text: Suddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the screen changes
text: to an image of the Veridian sun, held in the center of the alien
dialog: cross-hair.
speaker_heading: 169DPICARD (VFX-P)169D
text: begins working the control panel, desperate. He looks at the screen,
text: hits a control. Suddenly the probe cloaks. Picard reacts at his mistake.
text: Picard is left standing on an invisible platform three feet in the air.
text: Picard isn't sure what to do- he can feel the console, but he can't see
dialog: any of the controls.
text: Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward. Soran lands heavily on
text: the ground, unconscious. Kirk stands over him, breathing heavily. He
text: holds his back in pain- that old back pain from the beginning of the
dialog: film.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Kirk- there's a control PADD in his right pocket!
speaker_heading: 169EKIRK (VFX-P)169E
text: sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down, pulls the control
text: PADD out of Soran's pocket. He begins working it.
speaker_heading: 170	CLOSE ON SORAN170
text: His eyes open. He sees what Kirk is doing, looks around quickly, sees
text: the disruptor lying a few feet away, just beyond his reach.
speaker_heading: 171	THE PROBE LAUNCHER (VFX-P)	 171
text: Decloaks. Picard goes back to working on the controls.
speaker_heading: 171AKIRK (VFX-P)171A
text: he smiles.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: The 24th-century isn't so tough.
text: Without warning, Kirk is blasted forward, shot from behind. Reveal Soran
text: on the ground with the disruptor in his hand. He gets up, whirls around,
text: points the weapon at Picard.
scene_heading: 172	MOUNTAINTOP- WIDE	172
text: The probe is suddenly launched in a roar of flame. Soran freezes. His
text: eyes follow the probe as it arcs into the sky. The two men watch the
text: probe as it heads toward the sun.
speaker_heading: 172ATHE PROBE (VFX-I)	172A
text: makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down toward the planet.
text: Soran watches in horror as the probe crashes harmlessly into the distant
text: jungle. We hear a muffled explosion.
speaker_heading: 172BSORAN (VFX-I) 172B
text: can't believe his dreams have been shattered. He looks into the sky and
text: sees the distant ribbon streaking overhead. The disruptor falls from his
text: hand as he rushes to the top of the scaffolding.
speaker_heading: 173	PICARD173
text: moves to Kirk, checks his pulse. The Captain's eyes flutter- he's still
text: holding on, but he's badly wounded.
speaker_heading: 174	SORAN (VFX-I) 174
text: is standing on the rock ledge. He reaches up toward the sky as if trying
text: to grab the ribbon with his bare hands, but the ribbon passes by and
dialog: disappears.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: No!
text: His look of shock turns to fury and madness. He turns to Picard.
speaker_heading: SORAN
dialog: YOU!!
speaker_heading: 174BNEW ANGLE (VFX-P)	174B
text: He jumps down a few levels and then dives off the scaffolding at Picard.
text: But Picard is quicker. He grabs the disruptor and fires. The blast
text: catches Soran in mid-air.
text: Soran drops to the ground a short distance away. Dead. The pocketwatch
text: has been shattered.
speaker_heading: 175	PICARD175
text: turns back to Kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his lap. Kirk's eyes
text: flick open, and he takes a ragged breath.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Nice shot.
text: Kirk coughs. His eyes flutter. He's fading fast.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Yes. (beat) Thank you.
speaker_heading: KIRK
dialog: Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
text: Kirk coughs again.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: Try to hang on.

speaker_heading: KIRK
