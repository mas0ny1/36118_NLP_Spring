scene_heading: 1 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - DAY 1
text: Loud conversation, laughter, singing, and even dancing: the
text: teacher is missing in a 7th Grade classroom. This rare
text: absence of authority is intensely enjoyed by the crowd. It
dialog: looks like it's party time for these KIDS.
text: They talk and laugh, show each other photos on their phones,
text: draw spaceships and baboons on their notebooks, and fold
text: pieces of paper into airplanes that fly around the room.
text: In a corner, a GROUP OF GIRLS dance to the tune of a song
text: they are listening to on headphones.
text: On the other side of the room, TWO BOYS play like in a sword
text: fight, without swords.
text: Suddenly, someone turns out the lights. There's random
text: shouting and laughter.
text: An overhead projector is turned on, and a couple of the kids
text: start to make puppet figures that are seen on the white
dialog: screen.
text: A door opens, and a voice is heard, grave and authoritative.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER (O.S.)
dialog: What is going on here?!
text: The kids scramble back to their seats as the lights go on.
text: MR. PLUMMER, the teacher, has come in.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER
dialog: What is this mess?? Didn't you
dialog: promise me to be quiet? Can't I
dialog: even leave you alone for five
dialog: minutes?? Lionel, sit down. Sit
dialog: down, I said! Melissa, put your
dialog: phone away. Put it away right now!
dialog: I asked you to be quiet, and...
dialog: look at you. What a disappointment.
text: Mr. Plummer wanders around the classroom, inspecting
dialog: everyone. Each kid has a different reaction. Some are
text: frightened, others think it's funny. Some are respectful, and
text: some others, defiant.
text: The teacher stops by a desk that's covered by a VERY COLORFUL
text: DRAWING, while the STUDENT rushes to put away his large
text: collection of Caran d'Ache pencils neatly in the box.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER (CONT'D)
dialog: Jacob, what is this?
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 2.
text: JACOB "JAKE" JARDINE is pale and slender, with straight black
text: hair, a bit longer than the other kids, and deep brown eyes -
text: pretty in a delicate way, and shy, different from the other
dialog: tougher boys in the class.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It's the sky, Mr. Plummer.
text: Mr. Plummer picks up his drawing and shows it to the class.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER
dialog: A green sky with yellow stars??
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (barely audible)
text: It's Camp Jupiter's sky.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER
dialog: Watch out, Jacob: Vincent van Gogh
text: ended up cutting off his own ear.
text: Some of the boys have a ball with this. Girls cover their
text: mouths not to laugh out loud. Jake blushes, his eyes fill up
text: with quiet, angry tears; he wasn't even talking to anyone,
dialog: he was just drawing, doing his thing. Life is so unfair.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER
dialog: Quiet!! I said quiet, everybody!
dialog: This is not a playroom. It's not an
text: art studio. Much less a disco, Ms.
dialog: Neves. It's a classroom. It is my
dialog: classroom, and I asked you to be
dialog: quiet. A simple request, and you
dialog: showed me you don't know how to
dialog: behave yourselves. Was I talking to
dialog: the walls? Amanda, please collect
dialog: everybody's homework, and bring
dialog: them to me.
text: AMANDA, the teacher's favorite, promptly goes around the
text: class collecting homework. The individual students now listen
text: intently to Mr. Plummer's speech. But there are exceptions;
text: one or two still defy his authority, swallowing a laughter
dialog: that cannot contain itself.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER (O.S.)
dialog: If I had to leave the class, it is
dialog: because I had something very
dialog: important to do. I come back, and I
dialog: see you screaming and dancing!
dialog: There's a saying, it's an old
dialog: saying, that says: "Silence is
dialog: golden." Write this down, children.
dialog: "
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 3.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
text: Silence is golden but my eyes still
dialog: see. Talking is cheap, people
dialog: follow like sheep."
text: Mr. Plummer writes this up on the board. Jake, instead of
text: writing, furiously draws a wild dancing cobra on his
dialog: notebook.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER
dialog: What does this mean?
text: Amanda raises her hand, ready to give an answer.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER
dialog: Not now, Amanda. I want you all to
dialog: write down your thoughts on this:
dialog: "silence is golden."
text: He underlines "silence is golden" on the board.
speaker_heading: MR. PLUMMER (CONT'D)
dialog: Every child is to write an essay on
dialog: its meaning. Two pages minimum.
dialog: That's your homework for tomorrow.
dialog: Don't even come to the class if you
dialog: haven't done it! Now, let's open
dialog: our books. Page 23. Lionel, start
dialog: reading from the top. Stand up,
dialog: please. Stand up so we can all hear
dialog: you.
scene_heading: 2 EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE SCHOOL - DAY 2
text: Large groups of KIDS are coming out through the main gate of
text: the school. PILAR, a Filipino woman in her 50's, waits
text: outside looking attentively at every kid who walks out. She
text: sees the one she's looking for.
text: In the middle of different groups and cliques, Jake comes
dialog: walking alone.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Jake! Jake! Hey, Jake! Here!
text: Jake sees her, then runs and gives her a big hug, longer than
dialog: expected.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Hey hey hey. Look at you.
text: She ruffles his hair lovingly.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 4.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Your parents are going to be coming
dialog: home very late tonight. Come on.
dialog: Let's go.
text: They begin to walk together away from the school.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm thirsty.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: We can stop by Papaya King on the
dialog: way home.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes!
scene_heading: 2A EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE STREET - DAY 2A
text: Jake and Pilar are walking. Jake now has a drink from Papaya
text: King in his hand.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Listen, Jake. It's your
dialog: grandfather Max. There have been
dialog: some... developments.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Some what?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I mean, he got sick, and had to go
dialog: to the hospital.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sick with what?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I'm sure your parents will talk to
dialog: you when they get home. But I'm
dialog: going to make dinner for you. What
dialog: do you want?
text: He thinks for a moment.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 5.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What happened to Grandpa Max?
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: When you're old, things happen,
dialog: Jake. C'mon, let's make the light.
dialog: We need to get to the grocery.
text: They cross the street and continue on.
scene_heading: 2B INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT/JAKE'S ROOM - DAY 2B
text: Jake is at his desk working on a drawing.
scene_heading: 3 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT/KITCHEN &amp; LIVING ROOM - DAY 3
text: A comfortable, but cramped, NYC apartment.
text: In the kitchen, Pilar is preparing a steaming pot of
dialog: caldereta, Filipino beef stew.
text: A phone starts ringing, and Jake storms out of his bedroom.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Hey! Did you finish your homework?
text: Jake grabs the phone.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Jardine residence, good evening.
text: We hear the voice on the other end of the line.
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN (O.S.)
dialog: (over the phone)
dialog: Good evening. And who am I talking
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Who is this?
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN (O.S.)
dialog: (over the phone)
dialog: This is Stu Gershman, I'm an old
dialog: friend of Max Jardine's. Is this
dialog: Jacob?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 6.
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN (O.S.)
dialog: (over the phone)
dialog: Oh Jacob, last time I saw you, you
dialog: were a little baby. I guess you're
text: all grown up now.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Umm...
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN (O.S.)
dialog: (over the phone)
dialog: Is your dad at home? Your mom?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No, they're not home yet.
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN (O.S.)
dialog: (over the phone)
dialog: Oh well. I'm calling because... I'm
dialog: very sorry to hear about your
dialog: grandfather, Jacob. Max and I knew
dialog: each other for so long, we met when
dialog: we were about your age. You must be
dialog: - what, ten now?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Twelve.
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN (O.S.)
dialog: He was such a dear old friend of
dialog: mine, your granddaddy was. Do you
dialog: know when the service is going to
dialog: be?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What service?
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN (O.S.)
dialog: (over the phone)
dialog: The funeral. I imagine there's
dialog: going to be a service soon?
text: Jake pauses to take this in - he has just learned that his
dialog: grandfather has died.
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: Hold on a second.
text: He goes to the kitchen and gives the phone to Pilar.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: Who is it?
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 7.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: 4 EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/CASA DE MODA - DAY 4
text: LEONOR CALVELLI rolls down the metal shutters of a Brooklyn
text: storefront. A sign above reads "CASA DE MODA". It's the
text: ground floor commercial space of a two-story row house on a
text: commercial street in Brooklyn. She pushes down the last bit
dialog: of the gate with her foot to lock it up. You can still go in
text: and out through a door space that's open. She lights up a
text: cigarette and leans on the gate, calmly surveying the street -
dialog: a daily routine.
text: Leonor is in her early 50's, dark hair and dark eyes, her
text: beauty toughened up by a hard life. After a few puffs, she
text: hears a car parking in front, doors open and close. Leonor
text: recognizes someone, and throws her cigarette out. She opens
text: the door, and calls inside the store.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Antonio! Antonio!
speaker_heading: TONY (O.S.)
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Come! Come here!*
dialog: *- Throughout the film, italics will indicate when Leonor,
dialog: Tony and others speak Spanish.
text: She forces a smile, greeting the still unknown visitor, then
text: she turns to inside and calls again, impatiently.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Antonio!!
scene_heading: 5 EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/CASA DE MODA - DAY 5
text: Across the street from Leonor, Jake is helping his parents
text: BRIAN and KATHY JARDINE get plates of food wrapped in
text: cellophane and other catering goods from out of the car. The
text: couple, dressed in formal dark clothes, have the youthful
dialog: look of people who can afford to take a nice vacation once a
dialog: year.
text: Jake sees when ANTONIO "TONY" CALVELLI, a handsome 13 year
text: old boy with dark hair and eyes, comes running out from
text: inside the store, and stops next to Leonor.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 8.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: What were you doing?? If I say
dialog: `come here', you have to come. Give
dialog: them a hand. Go.
text: But Tony doesn't move, unsure of what to do. He looks at
text: Jake, who is looking at him.
text: Brian drops a plate in Jake's hands and goes towards Leonor,
text: with an extended hand.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Hello Mrs. Calvelli. Brian Jardine,
dialog: we've met.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Of course, Brian. I'm so sad for
dialog: what has happened. I'm so sorry.
text: Jake sees when Leonor, suddenly overtaken by emotion, grabs
text: his father's hand and pulls him closer for a hug, which makes
text: Brian visibly uncomfortable. Leonor tries to hide her tears.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: I'm sorry. Your father was a such a
dialog: wonderful man.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: He really was, you know.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: This is my son Antonio.
text: Kathy approaches, carrying a plate of food.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I don't think you've met my wife
dialog: Kathy.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Hi. Nice to meet you. Leonor.
text: Kathy smiles warmly, as Brian opens the door to the house.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: So nice to meet you too. Sorry, my
text: hands are full.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 9.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: We're having a little reception
text: upstairs. Just family and a few
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Of course.
text: Brian and Kathy go upstairs with their bags.
text: Left alone by the car, Jake tries to grab a sketchbook from
text: inside as he balances the big plate of food with his other
text: hand and then, a bit clumsy, ends up dropping the bag.
text: Tony is suddenly there to help him out. He kneels down to
text: pick up pages with drawings, pencils and stuff spilling out
text: of the bag, immediately recognizing the first drawing he sees
text: - a girl with red wings flying through a thundercloud.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Ella the Harpy!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Can you hand that to me?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: She's a nerd, but I have a thing
dialog: for redheads... Don't you?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Here, pass me that. I can carry it.
text: In the distance, Leonor watches, while Tony helps by pulling
text: another set of plates and bottles out of the car, organizing
text: a crate to be carried off.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Tyson is such a douchebag.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Not in the end, he's not. I just
dialog: finished The Blood of Olympus.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I have the game, wanna play?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Now? I'd like to, but... I can't.
dialog: It's my grandfather's--
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I know. I never know what to say in
dialog: these situations.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 10.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I think you're supposed to say,
dialog: "I'm sorry for your loss."
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's right! I'm sorry for your
dialog: loss.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh, that's okay.
text: Tony finds one last drawing that was left on the floor in the
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Wait a minute: what's this one
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It's the sky.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Did you make this??
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah, it's the sky above Camp
dialog: Jupiter, the day of the battle.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You're a real artist!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Of course you are. This is awesome!
dialog: You know you'll really like this
dialog: neighborhood.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We don't live here. It's just a
dialog: reception.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: It's become a very bohemian area.
dialog: You know what bohemian means?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Very artistic.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 11.
speaker_heading: BRIAN (O.S.)
dialog: Got it, son?
text: Brian is back by the car to pick up the stuff.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You okay with that, Antonio?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You can call me Tony.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well thank you, Tony. I appreciate
dialog: the help.
text: The two boys follow Brian towards the house, the three of
text: them carrying plates and bags.
scene_heading: 6 INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/FAMILY AREA - DUSK 6
text: The apartment is old and in desperate need of a paint job.
text: It's a large space, crammed with the stuff of a long life.
text: There are family photos, piles of National Geographic
text: magazines next to faded velvety couches and solid furniture.
text: A small, vintage color TV sits alone in the corner.
text: There's a quiet reception going on, with most people wearing
text: black, or dark colors, and talking softly to each other.
dialog: Amongst the mostly older friends and relatives of the
text: deceased are Brian's sister AUDREY and her husband JAMES, and
text: their teenage son, LIAM, dressed in a suit. They are sitting
text: on a couch next to Brian, leafing through a photo album.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Let me see. That was our first year
dialog: in the house. Look; I still had
dialog: braces.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Dad looks so young here.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: He was a handsome guy.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Listen to you.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You look just like him, and you
dialog: know it. Can I have this? Please?
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 12.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yes. I'll let you have the photo
dialog: IF...
text: Brian picks up a book on the table.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: ...you let me have the first
text: edition of The Velveteen Rabbit.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Now, wait a minute.
scene_heading: 6A INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/KITCHEN - DAY 6A
text: In the kitchen, KATHY is re-furbishing a tray of pastries
text: with new ones from a box from an Italian bakery. Pilar is
text: beside her, cutting fruit for a pitcher of punch.
scene_heading: 6B INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/FAMILY AREA - DAY 6B
text: Jake is sipping some juice, like a cocktail, and looking at
text: the art on the wall: a couple of oil paintings of Parisian
dialog: streets in the wintertime of dubious quality doesn't arouse
text: much interest, and he ends up in front of a vintage movie
text: poster on the wall, with ahead of its time 60s graphics -
text: probably the best piece of art in the apartment.
speaker_heading: BRIAN (O.S.)
dialog: Jake, come here.
text: Jake goes to see his father, who's standing next to STU
text: GERSHMAN, a well dressed gentleman in his 70's.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Do you remember Grandpa's friend
dialog: Stu Gershman?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN
dialog: Look at you, all grown up now.
dialog: How's school?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN
dialog: So, what kind of sports do you like
dialog: to play?
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 13.
text: Jake doesn't play any sports, and it's probably a point of
dialog: contention between father and son, given the sudden
text: uncomfortable moment of silence.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: He likes to draw and paint.
text: Jake blushes.
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN
dialog: So you'd like to be an illustrator
dialog: when you grow up?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN
dialog: Well, come here. Come here.
text: He pulls Jake in uncomfortably tight.
speaker_heading: STU GERSHMAN
dialog: I want to tell you a few things
dialog: about your grandfather, Jake: he
dialog: liked to play ball but was a
dialog: horrible pitcher; he hated summer
dialog: but went nuts seeing the ladies
dialog: walk by in mini-skirts; and he was
dialog: the most loyal friend you could
dialog: have. Loyalty was his greatest
dialog: quality.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Aww... Thanks, Stu. Did you hear
dialog: that, Jake?
text: Jake is saved from Stu by a knock on the door. He runs to
text: open it, and there she is: Leonor holding a beautiful cake.
text: Kathy, who also heard the knock, comes to see what's going
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: It's a dessert we make for special
dialog: occasions in my country.
text: She hands the cake to Kathy.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: I hope you like it.
text: Jake watches everything.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Oh my God. You didn't have to.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 14.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Max loved this cake, so I
dialog: thought....
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Come in. You should come in.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Please. I insist.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: No, I just wanted to bring the
dialog: cake.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Sorry if we didn't say anything
dialog: earlier. Brian and I... we're both
dialog: very tired. It's all been so fast.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: It's okay. I still have some
dialog: paperwork to do at the store.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Thank you so much for this. It's
dialog: very kind of you. Thank you.
text: Leonor leaves, and Jake shuts the door. Kathy is left with
text: the beautiful cake on her hands. She looks across the room
text: and sees Brian, in the middle of a crowd, holding court,
dialog: being a good actor.
scene_heading: 7 INT. JARDINE HOUSE/STAIRWELL - NIGHT 7
text: Brian walks down the interior stairs of the house, carrying a
text: heavy bag full of trash. At the bottom of the stairs, he
text: turns and walks down the dark corridor that leads to the
dialog: backyard.
text: He finds the large metal trash containers, and throws the
dialog: bags in.
text: Alone for the first time all day, Brian is overtaken by
text: memories and allows himself a good cry.
scene_heading: 8 INT. CASTING OFFICE - DAY 8
text: Brian is sitting at a table in a bare room, speaking in a
text: strong Italian-American Brooklyn accent.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 15.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I swear B, I'm surprised at you. I
dialog: sit there waiting for you to wake
dialog: up, but everything's great with
dialog: you.
text: We see he is holding a script, next to SUZANNE, a famous

speaker_heading: SUZANNE

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Why? What other worries you got?
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: When am I gonna be a wife again,
dialog: Eddie?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I ain't been feeling good. They
dialog: bother me since they came.
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: It's almost three months you don't
dialog: feel good. It's three months,
dialog: Eddie.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I don't know, B. I don't want to
dialog: talk about it.
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: Nice! Okay.
text: Suzanne smiles at Brian, already out of character. But Brian
dialog: really would love to keep going.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You go "you don't like me, heh?"
text: Shooting Script 07/27/15 16.
text: Suzanne looks for help from the audience, gently cutting
dialog: Brian off.
speaker_heading: DEBORAH (O.S.)
dialog: That's good, Jardine.
text: The casting director, DEBORAH, sits with scripts and lists
text: under a reading light, and a male ASSISTANT next to her. A

speaker_heading: SUZANNE

scene_heading: 9 EXT. CASTING OFFICE - DAY 9
text: ROGER, Brian's agent, is standing outside the theater,
text: texting on his phone. Brian comes out, and they begin to
dialog: walk.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: She fucking hates me.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: She doesn't hate you.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Ever since B.U. She dropped out - I
dialog: stayed and graduated. Every time
dialog: we've seen each other since then,
dialog: she always tries to prove that
dialog: she's better than me.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: You're paranoid. You did okay
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Did I?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Yes. But it's true that she'll have
text: a say in who's cast as her husband.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm telling you. She doesn't like
dialog: me. I'm in a slump, Roger. You need
dialog: to help me here.

speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Why don't we go have some coffee?
dialog: You have options. There are a bunch
dialog: of things that could pan out. Let

text: Roger goes back to his texting.
scene_heading: 10 INT. JARDINE APARTMENT - DAY 10
text: The apartment has been completely redone. The old furniture
text: is out, more modern - if used - furniture is in. There's less
text: stuff, so it looks more spacious. There are new appliances in
text: the kitchen, and some of the art from Brian and Kathy's old
text: Manhattan apartment now hangs on the walls, which have been
text: newly painted with fresh colors. Brian, Kathy and Jake have
dialog: moved in, and it looks really nice.
text: There are still piles of plates and pans to be put away, and
text: a few boxes on the floor by the kitchen. Pilar is taking
text: stuff out of one of them. Plates and trays and things wrapped
text: individually in bubble wrap and newspaper. Kathy unwraps them
dialog: and looks for places in the kitchen cabinets to put them
dialog: away.
text: While she's putting them away, Pilar unwraps a beautiful
text: crystal serving plate.
speaker_heading: PILAR
dialog: I don't remember this.
text: Kathy takes a looks at it, trying to remember where it came

speaker_heading: KATHY

scene_heading: 11 INT. CASA DE MODA/STORE - DAY 11
text: The store has women's clothes on display on simple racks,
text: with a few chosen pieces shown on a large table. It's an old-
text: fashioned store; the ambiance is simple and unsophisticated.
text: BIANCA, a salesgirl, is showing a dress with floral patterns
text: to a CUSTOMER as Kathy comes in, carrying the crystal plate.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 19.
text: She is going to say hello to the salesgirl, but doesn't want
text: to interrupt and goes directly towards Leonor, who is in the
text: back of the store behind a sewing machine, fixing the collar
text: of a shirt.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Leonor.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Hi Kathy. The boys are in my
text: office, in the back.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: No, no. Look what I just found.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: It's my plate.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I think that night we just ended up
dialog: taking everything back to our
dialog: apartment. And then we put things
dialog: away, and I forgot. I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: No worries! Please.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It's a beautiful plate.
text: She takes it from Kathy's hand.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Are you not working today?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I don't see patients on Monday. I
dialog: need a day a week to organize my
dialog: life, you know.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Good for you.
speaker_heading: KATHY
text: The store looks cute.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Huh... we're not doing so well.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I like that dress over there. The

dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 20.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: I love that one. You should try it
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I have to go back-
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Oh, c'mon. It'll take a minute.
scene_heading: 12 INT. CASA DE MODA/STORE - DAY 12
text: Kathy pulls open the curtain wearing the floral dress, and
text: shows it to Leonor, who's waiting outside.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Perfection.
text: Kathy walks towards the mirror wearing the floral dress.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Are you sure? I don't know.
text: Leonor comes with expert hands and pulls a pinch on the
text: shoulder strap.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: It looks great. All you need is a
dialog: little fixing up here, maybe a tiny
dialog: bit tighter here on the waist. But
text: the dress is beautiful.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: How much is it?
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Whatever the price, I'll give you
dialog: ten percent discount. Let me see.
text: Leonor looks for a tag around the cuffs.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Did you make this?
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: No. Not this one. But everything
dialog: here is handmade by the designers.
dialog: This one is two hundred and fifty.
dialog: It's made by a woman named Talita -
dialog: she's from Colombia, and very
dialog: talented. They probably do it in
dialog: their kitchens, you know what I
dialog: mean? They're not famous. Yet.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 21.
scene_heading: 13 INT. CASA DE MODA/OFFICE - DAY 13
text: There's a video game on the TV. Monsters and battles, and
dialog: sound effects.
text: And sitting in front of the TV set, taking it all in, are
text: Jake and Tony. It's a small space in the back of the store
text: that has been turned into an office - just a simple desk, a
text: TV, a chair and a couch in the corner.
text: Kathy comes in, dressed in the floral pattern dress. Leonor
text: is right behind her.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Guys, what do you think?
text: The boys don't move an inch, their attention 100% on the TV
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Jake? Jake, what is our deal?
text: She turns to Leonor.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: They're like zombies when they

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: Mom. I'm on vacation!
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Dad said it was okay.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: We have this rule in the house; no
dialog: games during the week. And no
dialog: internet before five either.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: But during vacation they have all
dialog: this free time, and what are you
dialog: going to do?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Shhh! Quiet!!
speaker_heading: LEONOR

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: LEONOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (back to Kathy)
dialog: When he's playing this stuff - I
dialog: know it's not so good, but at least
dialog: he's around, and I know where to
dialog: find him.
text: Tony pauses the game.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (polite)
dialog: Mrs. Jardine. Maybe you will let us
dialog: finish this level, please?
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: That's better.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Sure, you can finish. But first you
dialog: have to tell me: what do you think?
dialog: The dress?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Great. I actually thought it was
dialog: yours.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Jake?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Love it. Love the flowers.
dialog: The boys will say anything to get rid of their moms, so they
dialog: can continue to play their game.
scene_heading: 14 INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/JAKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 14
text: On the wall of Jake's new bedroom is the vintage movie poster
text: that used to belong to his grandfather. The room is painted
text: in bright colors, with a small bed, a small desk - a young
text: man's cocoon.
text: Jake is on his bed, a sketch pad on his lap and his Caran
text: d'Ache pencils next to him.
text: The door opens. Brian comes in.
speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What drawings? Help me cut these.
text: Brian hands Jake vegetables from the sink.
speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: The sea of monsters?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Those old drawings?
dialog: Jake starts cutting vegetables julienne style, very
dialog: carefully.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Did you look in the trunk?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes, Dad. I looked. They're not
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I don't know, Jake. Maybe they got
text: thrown away.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why would you do that? They're my
dialog: drawings!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Why don't you just make new ones.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 24.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: New ones are never like the old
dialog: ones!
text: Jake wishes he could strangle his dad right now. He's truly
dialog: upset.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Jake. We moved. We got rid of
dialog: furniture. We threw away clothes,
dialog: and we gave books away. We have a
dialog: new apartment.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Listen. Let me tell you something.
dialog: It's good to get rid of stuff. It's
dialog: hard at first, but then it feels
dialog: really good. You have to learn to
dialog: let go.
text: Jake keeps cutting the vegetables. He's so angry, it's hard
dialog: not to chop the zucchini into a million pieces....
scene_heading: 16 INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/FAMILY AREA - NIGHT 16
text: Brian and Jake are having dinner.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I play Trigorin. He's a celebrated

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why the weird names?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Can I finish? Her son Konstantin is
text: an aspiring writer who lives with
dialog: his uncle Sorin in this dacha,
dialog: where they all come together one

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Finished?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's just the beginning,
dialog: actually.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 25.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What's a dacha?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: A dacha is like a big country
dialog: estate in Russia. That's where the
dialog: whole thing takes place, and that's
dialog: why the funny names. There's also
dialog: Nina. She's the neighbors's
dialog: daughter, who wants to be an
text: actress. At first she seems to be
text: in love with Konstantin but ends up
dialog: having an affair with my character,
dialog: Trigorin.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sounds complicated.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, it is complex. And
dialog: unexpected. But it has a lot of

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What part?
text: The door opens, and Kathy comes in from work.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Good. You guys are already eating.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hi Mom.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: How was it?
text: Kathy drops her bag on a chair and goes to wash her hands

speaker_heading: KATHY

scene_heading: 16A INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/BATHROOM - NIGHT 16A

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I was just telling Jake about the
dialog: play.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I thought you weren't working with

dialog: were going to do Broadway now.
text: Kathy joins them and helps herself to a big plate.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It's not that simple.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You said you weren't doing this non-
dialog: profit stuff anymore. That the
dialog: strategy was to reach "a wider
dialog: audience".
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, things have changed.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Jake, you should applaud your

scene_heading: 17 EXT. HERBERT VON KING PARK - DAY 17
text: A tree-filled park in the middle of a quiet Brooklyn

text: years old, are kicking a soccer ball into a goal. Two
text: captains, UMAR and JOEY, are choosing one by one to form two
dialog: teams.
text: Tony rushes by on his scooter, fast. He avoids bumps - he
text: knows the area by heart. As he approaches the group of boys,
text: one of the boys tries to stop him.
speaker_heading: UMAR
dialog: Tony! Hey! Come play! We need one
dialog: more here!
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 27.
text: But Tony doesn't stop, and now comes Jake behind on his
text: ROLLER BLADES, trying to catch up. He's surprised by a bump
text: on the road, makes a false move, and almost falls.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Oops! Watch out, Katy Perry!
text: All the boys laugh. Jake is upset but keeps going, pretending
text: he didn't hear anything.
scene_heading: 17A INT. JARDINE HOUSE/STAIRWELL - DAY 17A
text: The boys enter the foyer of an old NYC tenement apartment
text: building. Tony carries his scooter, while Jake tries to take
text: off his blades as fast as he can.
text: They clomp up several flights.
scene_heading: 18 INT. LEONOR'S APARTMENT - DAY 18
text: An old apartment, functional and in need of paint job. Modest
text: furniture dominates the space, but there are a couple of eye
text: catching art pieces; a large modernist painting and a
text: striking sculpture. In a corner, there's a large bookshelf
text: filled with books, but one corner has been turned into a bar
text: with a few different types of glasses, and various liquor
dialog: bottles.
text: Leonor is in the living room preparing a drink next to HERNÀN
text: ALONSO, Latin, early 60's, dressed in a suit and tie. He
text: stands close to Leonor, and leans over to help her with the
text: drink. At this very moment, Jake and Tony burst in through
dialog: the door.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Eight minutes and twenty three
dialog: seconds!
text: He throws his scooter on the floor and runs to the kitchen.

speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Wow, I think you should call the

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's a great idea! I'll write

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Good evening, Mrs. Calvelli.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Hi Jake.
dialog: (to her son)
dialog: You haven't said hello, Mister!

speaker_heading: HERNÀN
dialog: Hello there, Jake.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: He used to live in Manhattan, but
text: now he lives above Mami's store.
dialog: Jake, this is Hernàn.
text: He finishes his glass of water, and runs to his room. Jake
text: stays alone with the adults.
speaker_heading: HERNÀN
dialog: Ah! So you are the Grandson-
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: (cuts him off)
dialog: Yes. Max was his grandfather. His
dialog: father is Brian Jardine, the one
dialog: that I told you about.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: My father's an actor. And my mom is
dialog: a psychotherapist.
speaker_heading: HERNÀN
dialog: I see. So how do you like Brooklyn
dialog: so far?
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 29.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I like it a lot. It's more peaceful
dialog: than Manhattan, and we have much
dialog: more space. It's great.
speaker_heading: HERNÀN
dialog: So Jake, are you going to be an
dialog: actor, like your father?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: HERNÀN
dialog: But you look like an artist
dialog: yourself. With that long hair and
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Maybe.
text: This conversation is getting too deep for Jake. Leonor sees
text: that he's uncomfortable, and helps him out.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: He'll tell us more later, right
dialog: Jake? Go ahead.
text: Jake runs inside Tony's room.
scene_heading: 19 INT. LEONOR'S APARTMENT/TONY'S ROOM - DAY 19
text: Tony's room is typical teenager with a small bed, a desk with
text: computer and posters of music and movies. Tony's on the bed,
text: lost in thought. He's clearly been listening in on the
text: conversation in the other room.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Is your father any good at acting?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know. Maybe.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I thought if he was, I might have a
dialog: conversation with him, cause I'm
dialog: going to be an actor when I grow
dialog: up. Maybe he can give me some
dialog: pointers.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sure, yeah. I guess. He's not that
dialog: successful or anything.

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: My dream is to go to the LaGuardia
dialog: High School for the Performing
dialog: Arts? You know that school? Nicki
dialog: Minaj went there. And Al Pacino,
text: but heflunked out.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I think my dad applied there.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Really? It's my dream school. I'm
dialog: looking around at some theater
dialog: classes, and practicing on my own,
dialog: so I can audition next year for
dialog: ninth grade.
text: He pulls out a stack of plays from his drawer.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: These are some of the scripts I'm
dialog: working on. I'm going to need to
dialog: practice a lot, and sometimes I
dialog: might need a partner, okay?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But I'm not an actor.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's okay. You can read, can't
dialog: you? Here look at this. This is a
dialog: scene from Pariah, or the Outcast,
dialog: by August Strindberg. It's perfect
dialog: for us to work on, cause it's just
dialog: two guys.
text: Jake takes the book tentatively, and flips through it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: And you know what, if you practice
dialog: your drawing more, and get better,
dialog: maybe we could both go to
dialog: LaGuardia. It's for all kinds of
dialog: artists. It's very Bohemian.
text: Jake puts the script down, uncommitted.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I guess I can try.

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's the spirit.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Is Hernàn your mom's boyfriend?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Hernàn? Eww, gross. No. He's just a
dialog: friend of her's from Chile. My mom
dialog: is still married to my dad. They
dialog: just don't live together much.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Me either! My dad travels a lot, so
dialog: they are never together. He's a
dialog: nurse, and he works for Doctors
dialog: Without Borders, which is from what
dialog: I can tell a job you get if you
dialog: want free plane flights.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Where is he now?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: He's in Angola. That's in Africa.
dialog: Until he was 20 he never left this
dialog: neighborhood, and then once he left
dialog: he barely ever came back. If I
dialog: wasn't here I don't think he'd ever
dialog: come back to Brooklyn.
text: Tony jumps up and goes to his desk.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Look what he sent me.
text: He pulls a box from a shelf, full of books and CDs and stuff.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Do you miss having him around more?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: At first I did. But it's been a few
dialog: years now, so I got used to it.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sometimes my dad goes away, if he's
dialog: shooting a movie. But it hasn't
dialog: really happened in a while.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 32.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Maybe he's not the guy I should
dialog: talk to.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know. He's been in a bunch
dialog: of plays and stuff.
text: Tony is still looking... and he finally finds it.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Found it!
text: He picks up a big book and drops it in Tony's lap.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: My dad and I are going to go on a
dialog: safari, and these are just like
dialog: some of the animals we are going to
dialog: see.
text: Jake looks through pictures of African savannahs and animals.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Do you wish they still lived
dialog: together?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sometimes. When my dad comes to
dialog: visit, he'll cook Porcheta. It's
text: like roast pork butt.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Ewww.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: It's good.
dialog: (pause)
text: We sit at the table just the three
dialog: of us, and he tells stories about
dialog: his work and the places he's been,
dialog: and stories about the different
dialog: people he's met in Africa. Then it
dialog: seems like normal. But then, pretty
text: soon they start fighting about
dialog: something stupid. And I realize
dialog: it's better when he's not around.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Imagine if your mom goes with you
dialog: on your safari, and they end up
text: falling in love again.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 33.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I think there's very little chance
dialog: of that happening.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But just imagine: you get an
dialog: envelope one day. You open it and
dialog: it's two tickets to a safari. One
dialog: for you, and one for your mom.
dialog: And she decides to go, because she
dialog: feels like she needs a vacation.
dialog: So when you get to Africa, your dad
dialog: picks you both up at the airport,
dialog: and takes you to this incredible
dialog: place. Like this photo here. You
text: see lions and elephants, giraffes.
dialog: And then, it's the end of a
dialog: beautiful day in the African
dialog: savannah. Your dad wants to take
dialog: you up this big hill to see the
dialog: sunset, but you're too tired, so
dialog: you tell your parents you're going
dialog: to rest in your hotel room.
speaker_heading: TONY
text: So they go the two of them alone.
dialog: And when they get there, the colors
dialog: of the sky are like nothing they've
dialog: ever seen before...
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: A green sky with yellow stars...
text: The door opens, with Leonor in an apron and a wooden spoon in

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Please. I can't tell you how happy

dialog: an B plus, which was pretty good,

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Wow. I'm impressed.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Linda, I'm going to be honest with
dialog: you. My friend and I heard this

dialog: listen, listen and talk.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 43.
speaker_heading: ACTING TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Not to act. The genesis of acting
dialog: is seeing. Yes? That's the first
dialog: thing. The raw material of all
dialog: acting is seeing, observing,
dialog: understanding what makes behavior.
dialog: I would say pay attention! So when
dialog: we start doing the repetition
dialog: exercise, that person does it to
dialog: you; you just react. Whereas a lot
dialog: of actors make it happen. Yes? But
dialog: that's not acting. That's pushing,
dialog: whereas you should just be relaxed.
text: The kids are listening, intently, taking it in.
speaker_heading: ACTING TEACHER
dialog: Does that make sense?
text: No one answers.
speaker_heading: ACTING TEACHER
dialog: Okay, let's begin.

dialog: Alright, I have a little nose.

speaker_heading: ACTING TEACHER
dialog: We've got to keep the contact.
dialog: We've got to keep the repetition.
dialog: The contact comes from my behavior.
dialog: Not just what I say, but what I do.
text: Jake looks for help from Tony.
speaker_heading: ACTING TEACHER
dialog: Look at me. Now tell me something

dialog: You almost fell.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I almost fell crossing the Parkway.
speaker_heading: ACTING TEACHER
dialog: (to the class)
dialog: You see he didn't do it. What was I
dialog: saying?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm sorry I don't understand.
speaker_heading: ACTING TEACHER
dialog: You don't need to understand.
dialog: Acting is not understanding. It's
dialog: feeling. It's reacting. Does that
dialog: make sense? Look at me. Listen to
dialog: me.
text: Jake looks at him intently, trying to do the right thing.
speaker_heading: ACTING TEACHER
dialog: What did I say without words? What
dialog: did my behavior say? Now say it

speaker_heading: EVA
dialog: Mr. Clay was the first love of my

dialog: You just need to believe in

dialog: I'm so sorry. Rehearsal went later
dialog: than I expected. Is this still a
dialog: good time?
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Yes. I sent the girl home early so
dialog: we could talk. You want to go
dialog: inside? I'm just going to finish
dialog: this.
scene_heading: 35 INT. CASA DE MODA/STORE - NIGHT 35
text: Brian is inside the store. He looks around, not sure where to
text: place himself. It gets darker and a loud `bang' is heard. The
text: metal shutter has been pulled down to close the store. Leonor
text: comes in.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: The store looks nice.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Thanks. I did a lot of work here.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: The reason why I'm here, Leonor...
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Your lease has been expired for
dialog: more than six months now. I guess
dialog: you guys were about to renew it
dialog: when my father passed?
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Brian, why don't you sit down.
text: They go towards the back of the store. Leonor sits behind her
text: desk/sewing machine, Brian in front of her. He opens his
text: messenger bag, and takes out a brown envelope.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: My sister and I are working on the
dialog: transfer of ownership for the
dialog: house. It's almost done; Dad left
dialog: everything in order, all the taxes
dialog: paid and all that. The only thing
text: still pending is the store, which
dialog: needs to have a new lease.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 56.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: You know, your father never thought
dialog: much about contracts. He was very
dialog: happy to have me here. Max thought
dialog: my store gave "glamour" to the
dialog: neighborhood, and he was proud to
dialog: be associated.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: The situation has changed, and now
dialog: we have two families owning the
dialog: house; mine and Audrey's. It's
dialog: better for us, and for you, to have
dialog: things done the right way, wouldn't
dialog: you agree?
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: It depends on what the right way is
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Leonor, this neighborhood is
dialog: changing very fast. The rents have
dialog: gone up quite a lot in the past few
dialog: years. I'm sure you've noticed.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Yes, I noticed and so did Max. But
dialog: it was his desire that I stay here.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: We don't want you to go away. My
dialog: sister Audrey has prepared a new
dialog: lease for you, and we think it's
dialog: very fair. We aren't trying to get
dialog: market rate here, we know that's
dialog: not possible, but still, you can't
dialog: expect to pay the same rent you
dialog: paid when you first moved in.
text: Brian pulls some papers out of his bag.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Here, why don't you take a look.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Before we go any further with this
dialog: conversation, I want you to take a
dialog: look at this.
text: Leonor opens a drawer, and takes out a small pile of
text: photographs. She hands them to Brian.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 57.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: I am probably the last person to
dialog: have photos printed, the old
dialog: fashioned way. It's completely
dialog: different than seeing them on a
dialog: cellphone, don't you agree?
text: Brian looks through the photos. Leonor looks over his
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: That's me in the backyard, on July
dialog: 4th. That's me and Tony and your
dialog: father at the Fair of St.
dialog: Anthony's. That's us with my
dialog: family, when they were visiting.
dialog: Your father and I were very good
dialog: friends. We spent a lot of time
dialog: together. What you and your sister
dialog: don't understand is that Max wanted
dialog: me to stay here. He thought of me
dialog: as part of this house, this
dialog: neighborhood.
text: He returns the photos to Leonor.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: I was more his family, if you want
dialog: to know, than you were.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's a ridiculous thing to say.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: You hardly talked to each other.
dialog: You never came to visit. I was the
dialog: one here. I saw him everyday.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: This is not what I came here for.
dialog: Why don't we go back to the lease.
dialog: Take a look, please. It's fair.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: No, I don't need to. I have an idea
dialog: what you and your sister have in
dialog: mind. I'll just give this to my
dialog: lawyer because, to be honest with
dialog: you, Brian, I'm not sure I owe you
dialog: anything. Maybe it's the other way
dialog: around.
text: Brian is speechless, sideswiped by Leonor's intensity and
dialog: conviction.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 58.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, I guess there's not that much
dialog: more to be said then.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: No.
text: Brian walks to the door, and out.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Goodnight, Leonor.
text: Leonor says nothing.
scene_heading: 36 INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 36

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Brian. Want to help me out here?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Sure, but just give me a moment.
speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Can Tony stay and eat with us?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (harsh)
dialog: No.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 59.
text: They stop playing, and look at Brian with surprise.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why not? He wanted to ask you about
dialog: your acting career.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's enough for tonight. Turn it
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Dad, c'mon!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I said no.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: We're about to finish the level.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Tony, you need to go home now. We
dialog: can talk about acting another time.
text: Brian notices the boys are getting uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sure, Mr. J.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (to Tony, softening)
dialog: I'm sorry, buddy. Your mother is
dialog: waiting for you downstairs.
text: Brian makes a quick exit, shutting the door behind him.
text: The boys look at each other, unsure of what to do.
scene_heading: 38 INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/BATHROOM - NIGHT 38
text: Water is pouring from the shower. Brian, naked inside the
text: glass, tests the temperature with his hand carefully. He
text: adjusts the temperature one bit more, and finally goes under
dialog: the shower.
text: Brian takes a deep breath in, and a deep breath out as the
text: water rains down on him, hoping it will wash off his
text: apprehensions.
scene_heading: 39 INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 39
text: Jake, with a backpack, and Tony are in the middle of a

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Did you ask your mother?
speaker_heading: TONY
text: She loves when Jake comes over.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Please, Mom? Please?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Jake I just made dinner.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'll eat it tomorrow for lunch, I
dialog: promise.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Okay. But I want you back here in

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes! Thanks.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Thank you, Mrs. Jardine.

text: it behind them.
scene_heading: 40 EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/CASA DE MODA - NIGHT 40
text: Outside the house, Leonor is closing the gate to her store,

speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: No, Antonio.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: C'mon, Mami. We have spaghetti in
dialog: the fridge.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: When I say no I mean it. Don't ask
dialog: me again.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 61.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: But we're going to be super quiet!
dialog: Aren't we, Jake?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yes we are.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Antonio. No. Listen to me and don't
dialog: argue.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It's okay Tony. I'll see you
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Leonor begins to walk away.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Goodnight, Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE

scene_heading: 41A EXT. BROOKLYN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 41A

scene_heading: 44 EXT. HERBERT VON KING PARK - DAY 44
text: Jake rolls through the park on his roller blades. He arrives
text: at the sport's field, and stays on the edge, observing the
dialog: activity of the players.
text: Half the kids are without shirts, playing against the other
text: team, with shirts. They're running and kicking the ball,
text: sweaty, screaming at each other, throwing themselves at the
text: ball. Jake sees Tony, playing goalie, and walks towards him.
text: They talk as Tony continues to pay attention to game.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I'm not talking to my mother
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: She said you can't come over to our
dialog: place. It's not right.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why doesn't she want me over?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I don't think your father wants me
dialog: around very much anymore either. He
dialog: might be too chicken to come out
dialog: and say it, but I can tell.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Why are they so mad at us?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Our parents are involved in a
dialog: business matter and it's getting
dialog: ugly. So they're taking it out on
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You're right. My dad was very cold
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You'd think I was the enemy.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I won't talk to my parents either
dialog: then.
text: The opponents head towards Tony and the goal.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 63.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Really. Not unless they apologize.
speaker_heading: UMAR

text: Tony looks at Jake.
speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Of course I can handle it.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Hey.
text: Jake's eyes remain glued to his drawing.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Did something happen with Leonor
dialog: downstairs?
text: Jake looks at his father, but doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
text: The store is closed. It's not even
dialog: five yet.
text: Jake shrugs his shoulders, turns his attention back to the
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Have you seen Tony?
text: Another shrug.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 64.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Jake, can you stop playing around
dialog: for a second??
text: Jake stops.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Did you see if the store was open
dialog: earlier when you got home?
text: Jake shakes his head yes.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Was it open?
text: Jake shakes his head no.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No? It wasn't?
text: Brian's cell phone starts ringing.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Talk to me Jake!
text: Jake looks at his dad, but doesn't say anything. Brian,
text: resigned, picks up his phone.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Audrey. Hi.
text: Jake watches as his father walks towards the door, and out,
text: talking on the phone.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: No, I haven't heard from her. (...)
dialog: Today I got home early and the
dialog: store was closed, it's strange.
dialog: (...) Isn't it better if you call

dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 65.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It's not your fault.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: But I feel very responsible. We are
dialog: responsible.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Audrey will tell you if she thinks
dialog: you owe her money. Don't worry
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: She sort of did already.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: She told me we owe her money for

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Incredible.
dialog: Kathy can't believe this.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yes, I know.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Jake. Did you see Leonor today?
text: Jake, shakes his head no, and sits down at the table.
speaker_heading: KATHY
text: Ah. Still not talking.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No.
text: She hands Jake the bowl of salad.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You know, you can't go on with this

text: Jake starts helping himself.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: Have you seen Jake's latest
dialog: artwork?
text: Shooting Script 07/27/15 66.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: He's been doing a lot of
dialog: mythological stuff.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Is that inspired by that book I
dialog: gave you?
text: Jake swings his head side to side: more or less.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: The Blood of Olympus.
text: Jake swings his head again, more emphatically: more or less,
dialog: I said.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Truth is, if he's really serious
dialog: about applying to LaGuardia, he's
dialog: going to need to start preparing a
dialog: serious portfolio, no?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yes. From what I remember, only 2%
dialog: of the students who apply to
dialog: LaGuardia get accepted. This means
dialog: two out of a hundred. Twenty out of
dialog: a thousand. They're not just
dialog: looking for talent; they're looking
dialog: for serious commitment.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: And you famously flunked.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I didn't "flunk"!
text: Kathy laughs. Jake also. Brian doesn't find it funny.
speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Hi. Can I help you with anything?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Thanks. I'm looking for Leonor. Oh,
dialog: I see her.
text: Leonor is behind the sewing machine in the back of the store,
text: fixing a pair of palazzo pants.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Hi Leonor.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Hi. Just a second, let me just me
dialog: finish this.
text: Kathy sits on a chair across from her, and waits for her to
text: finish sewing. Leonor pulls the pants away from the machine,
text: and breaks the thread with her teeth.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: You're home early.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Monday.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Right. Your day off. Oh, you have
dialog: to see this new dress. Bianca, show
dialog: her the new dress! The green one.
text: Leonor puts another pair of pants on the machine, and starts
dialog: sewing.
text: Bianca picks up a green dress from the racks. Kathy,
text: politely, goes to check it out.
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: Remember the original wrap dress,
dialog: the first one that Diane von
dialog: Furstenberg made?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Of course. Wow, that's an original?
speaker_heading: BIANCA
dialog: No, we found this fabric, it's
dialog: vintage fabric. And Leonor made the
dialog: dress herself.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 68.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It's beautiful. Wow. But it's
dialog: really not my style. Thank you. I
dialog: need to talk to Leonor.
text: Kathy approaches the back of the store again. This time
text: Leonor keeps concentrated on her sewing job, and doesn't stop
dialog: to talk.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Cute dress.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: I made it. The fabric is vintage.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes. I really like it, but I can't
dialog: wear anything too tight on the
dialog: waist these days. I need to lose a
dialog: few pounds first.
text: Leonor keeps sewing. Kathy looks around the store. She
text: clearly wants to say something, but Leonor avoids any eye
dialog: contact.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Leonor, do you have a minute?
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: I have to finish this for a client
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Tony is still not talking?
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: No. Not a word to me yesterday.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Same with Jake.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: It's very annoying.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: The one good thing, I have to say,
dialog: is that Jake has been drawing and
dialog: painting more than ever.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Is that good?
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 69.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes! If he really wants to apply to

dialog: on applying also?
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: How would I know? It's been four
dialog: days and he hasn't said a word to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Listen, Leonor, you know that I'm
dialog: trained in conflict resolution, so
dialog: I'm hoping I can help here, help
dialog: settle this problem between you and
dialog: our family.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Oh really? Has your husband asked
dialog: you to do that?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: No. And by the way, he's been
dialog: working really hard. I'm not sure
dialog: you know that, but he's rehearsing
dialog: for a new play.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: No. I haven't seen your husband.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I know he's been waiting to hear
dialog: from you.
text: Leonor doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Leonor?
text: Leonor continues to sew, until Kathy loses her patience, and
text: slaps her hand on top of the piece of clothing Leonor is
text: trying to sew.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Can't we talk about what is really
dialog: going on here?
text: Leonor is startled: a completely unexpected reaction from

dialog: listening.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Shh. Not here.

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I know you think we're the rich

dialog: Brian hasn't made any money in
dialog: years. I've been supporting this
dialog: family with my hard work.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: That's not my problem.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I know it's not. I'm just trying to
dialog: talk about it.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: You think talking is going to solve
dialog: all your problems, don't you? You
dialog: think you can use some of your
dialog: psychology class tricks and just
dialog: wash away the dirt here? That dirt
dialog: is my sweat, sweetie. It's my life.
dialog: It's not going to be that easy.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I know that. What I want to tell
dialog: you is we will give you time, but
dialog: we need this money. We need the
dialog: shop to cover its rent. That's not
dialog: an unfair thing to ask of a tenant.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: But I'm not a tenant. To Max I was
dialog: more than a tenant. I was family. I
dialog: belong here. And before you go any
dialog: further; let me ask you: do you
dialog: know how much work I've done here?
dialog: The tile floors? The marble
dialog: bathroom? That office in the back?

speaker_heading: LEONOR
text: He's mad at his mother.
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: LEONOR

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Tony, now that I'm here you're not

speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: No. A fighting strategy.
speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: What do you want me to say, Nick?
dialog: That I'm going to open a drug

text: Leonor stops eating for a moment. She can't believe her ears.
speaker_heading: LEONOR

speaker_heading: NICK

dialog: personally, Leonor. The world isn't
dialog: always stacked up against you.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: What does this have to do with

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Rent goes up. That's life in this

speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Can't you be on my side for once in

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm just being realistic. Life here

speaker_heading: LEONOR

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I know it's not.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: That store is how I have raised our

dialog: thank you very much.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Really? Do you think that sending
dialog: him a little gift at the end of the

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Listen, Tony. I know your mom can

dialog: And now Leonor's lawyer is charging

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: AUDREY

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Is it terrible, Brian, that I don't

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Do you miss him?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Sometimes. But I live in his house,
dialog: so I probably think about him more

speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: She's claiming she has the right to

text: In the middle of the dance floor, Julia and Tony dance with

speaker_heading: NINA
dialog: What are you writing?

text: Brian/Trigorin looks intently into Nina's eyes.
speaker_heading: BRIAN/TRIGORIN (CONT'D)
dialog: She loves the lake as the gulls do,

speaker_heading: ROGER

speaker_heading: ROGER

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Act two, particularly.
speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: But that doesn't take anything away

speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: father or his friend.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Jake? Say something.
text: Jake looks at Tony, who is shaking his head vigorously.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Say something!
text: Jake is frozen.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: One of the hardest things to
dialog: realize as a child is that your
dialog: parents are people too. Can you
dialog: understand that? That they care
dialog: about things. That they make
dialog: mistakes. That they try to do what
dialog: they think is right. Does any of
dialog: what I'm saying make any sense to
dialog: you?
text: Jake shakes his head yes. Tony laughs.
text: Shooting Script 07/27/15 86.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What's so funny, Tony? Why don't
dialog: you tell me, what's funny?? You
dialog: think being an actor is easy? You
dialog: think you have it in you for one

dialog: how you react when you don't get

dialog: then.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Brian...

speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Dresses go over there, on that rack
dialog: on the left. Before you hang them,
dialog: make sure they have a price tag.
dialog: Also, try to arrange them by color,
dialog: or tone. I usually like to start
text: with lighter colors in the front,
dialog: and end with darker ones. Black
dialog: goes in the back. The women here
dialog: like black a lot, so if they're
text: looking for a little black dress,
dialog: they might see a lot of other stuff
dialog: before they get there.
speaker_heading: VALENTINA
dialog: I see. So if they don't know what

speaker_heading: LEONOR

speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: I thought you were in a new big

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I am in a new play. But it's not
dialog: big, and it's not a lot of money.
dialog: It's just the way it is, Leonor.
dialog: I'm fortunate enough to have had a
dialog: father who left me a house in
dialog: Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: He wanted me to stay here. He told

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Leonor. I also have a sister, and

dialog: have to decide together what to do.
dialog: It's not just up to me.

speaker_heading: LEONOR

dialog: the last one?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: He had the flu.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: No. That's maybe what he told you.
dialog: The truth is, he was embarrassed,
dialog: Brian. He was embarrassed that

dialog: I'm sorry, Leonor.
text: He takes the paper from Leonor's hands.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Where do they even get this number?
text: Her eyes fill up with angry tears.
speaker_heading: HERNÀN
dialog: The penalty for overstaying may

dialog: That's why it's in the contract; to

speaker_heading: LEONOR

speaker_heading: HERNÀN

text: They have been waiting for awhile, waiting for the boys to
text: emerge. It's clearly an awkward situation for everyone.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You sure I can't get you something,
dialog: Leonor.
speaker_heading: LEONOR
dialog: Yes, I'm fine.
text: Another moment of awkward silence... Until suddenly the door
text: opens and Jake comes running out.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mom! Dad! Mom!!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: He talks! Jacob talks!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mom!!!
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: What's going on?!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Mom, Tony told me Leonor is being
dialog: evacuated from the store!
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It's not an evacuation. It's an
dialog: eviction.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's worse!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How could you do that? How could
dialog: you do that to them? Dad??
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It's a terrible situation.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: The rent is too expensive! She
dialog: can't afford it, Mom. So Dad needs
dialog: to give her a discount so she can!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Your mother and I wanted to talk to
dialog: you, Jake, but this not talking
dialog: didn't help!
text: Shooting Script 07/27/15 93.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Don't blame this on him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It's okay, I'm talking now! I'm
dialog: sorry! I'm sorry! I'll never do
dialog: that again. I promise. Dad, I
dialog: promise.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Jake, calm down.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I have a great idea.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Let me explain to you, Jake.
dialog: Grandpa Max left this house not
dialog: just for the three of us here.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I know. He loved Leonor too. Tony
dialog: told me!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: He liked Leonor, of course, but he
dialog: left the house for us, and also for
dialog: Aunt Audrey.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But I have an idea! I know how we
dialog: can make it work! We go back to our
dialog: old apartment, and we rent this
dialog: place and give the money to Aunt
dialog: Audrey. Tony and I are both going
dialog: to be at the LaGuardia High School
dialog: for Performing Arts in Manhattan,
dialog: so I won't need to take the subway
dialog: or anything to school. I can walk.
dialog: And you'll be closer to the
dialog: theater. I loved the show, Dad. I
dialog: loved it. Tony did too. We both
dialog: talked about it a lot afterwards.
dialog: You were so good! And I thought it
dialog: was really complex and everything.
dialog: I'm sorry I didn't tell you then.
dialog: I'm sorry. But I loved it. I really
dialog: did!
text: Leonor, Tony, Kathy, and Brian all look in silence as Jake
text: goes on, trying to make this adult mess make sense again.

scene_heading: 67A EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/CASA DE MODA - NIGHT 67A
text: We see the house from the otuside. The gate has not been
text: pulled down on the storefront yet, but most of the lights are
dialog: off.
text: Upstairs the lights are all on.
scene_heading: 68 EXT. BROOKLYN - NIGHT 68
text: A wide shot of the city of Brooklyn, houses and trees, the

scene_heading: 69 EXT. BROOKLYN - DAY 69
text: A similar shot across Brooklyn at day, with the bridge and

scene_heading: 70 INT. CASA DE MODA/STORE - DAY 70
text: There are no clothes anymore, no decorations on the wall, the
text: racks are bare naked. The store is completely empty.
scene_heading: 70A EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/CASA DE MODA - DAY 70A
text: Jake takes a look inside the store through the window.
text: There's a "FOR RENT" sign on the glass. Jake looks for a good
text: long moment, and then skates off down the street.
scene_heading: 71 EXT. HERBERT VON KING PARK - DAY 71
text: Boys are playing a game of soccer.
text: Jake approaches on his roller blades, and comes to a stop at

scene_heading: 72A EXT. WATERFRONT PARK - DAY 72A
text: We see Jake alone for almost the first time, and he is both
text: more vulnerable, and more confident. He passes by the
text: Verazzano-Narrows Bridge, and then along the waterfront. He
text: moves in silence, only the sound of the wind and the expanse
text: of the Bay beside him.
speaker_heading: 73 OMITTED 73
scene_heading: 74 EXT. WATERFRONT PARK - DAY 74
text: Brian pulls up in his car, comes to a stop, and gets out. And
text: already walking towards the car is Jake, with bandages on his
text: right knee, being helped along by a PARK RANGER, who carries
text: his roller blades.
speaker_heading: PARK RANGER
dialog: Mr. Jardine?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: How are you, Son?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm sorry, Dad.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: There was a bump on the path...
speaker_heading: PARK RANGER
dialog: We got a call from a woman who saw
text: Jake here flying through the air
dialog: and landing on the asphalt. When we
text: found him, he couldn't move.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'm better now.
speaker_heading: PARK RANGER
dialog: He is better. But he probably
dialog: shouldn't be on his own at his age.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: There was a bump, I didn't see.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Are you hurt?
text: Jake shrugs.
text: Shooting Script 07/27/15 96.
speaker_heading: PARK RANGER
text: He fell on his right side shoulder,
text: and he scraped his knee.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Let's go home.
text: The ranger helps Brian put Jake in the back, with his leg
text: stretched out and his foot up on the seat. Brian gets in to
text: the driver's seat of the car.
scene_heading: 75 INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/JAKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 75
text: Jake is lying down on his bed. Kathy applies antibacterial
text: cream carefully to his scraped knee.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Is it okay like this?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah. Go slow.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: And how's your arm? Can you move it
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It hurts when I go like this.
text: He moves it up and down a hair. Brian is standing behind
text: them, in the dark.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Dad had a heating pad that he used
dialog: to use. I can't find it.
dialog: (to Kathy)
dialog: You know where it is?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I think it's in the hall closet.
dialog: I'll get it in a minute.
text: She finishes with the cream, then gives Jake a kiss, and
text: steps out.
text: Brian takes over for her to finish the bandages.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Do you still have a lot to do to
dialog: finish your portfolio?
text: Shooting Script 07/27/15 97.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I just need to finish one painting,
dialog: and then I'm done.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's what you said last week. You
dialog: just had to finish one painting.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I want them to be good.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Jake, do you by any chance remember
dialog: that story I told you, about my
dialog: friend Tina?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: The one who sold her hair in India
dialog: for a train ticket?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No, that was Martine. Tina was a
dialog: girl I knew in high school who was
dialog: a dancer. Her mother was a dancer.
dialog: She was literally born to be a
dialog: dancer. She had a perfect ballet
dialog: dancer's body, and all of us were
dialog: certain she was going to be a big
dialog: success.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Have I seen her dance?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No. During high school, she got
dialog: into a really good conservatory,
dialog: and I ran into her a couple of
dialog: times after that, and she was
dialog: always about to get this, or about
dialog: to get that. But each time, her arm
dialog: would be in a sling, or she would
dialog: be on crutches. She would have a
dialog: pulled ligament. Or a stress
text: fracture in her back. The last time
dialog: I saw her, I ran into her on the
dialog: subway, it was clear she hadn't
dialog: danced for years. She was fat. You
dialog: would have never imagined that she
dialog: was the same girl.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Gee, thanks Dad. That's a very
dialog: encouraging story.
text: Shooting Script 07/27/15 98.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Why do you think Tina didn't go
dialog: very far?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: She trained too hard. She practiced
dialog: too much. She didn't trust her own
dialog: natural abilities.
text: He continues to wrap the bandage.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Jake, you're going to meet a lot of
dialog: really talented people in your
dialog: life. But they won't all be suited
dialog: to be artists, they won't all have
dialog: the brains to know when to insist,
dialog: and when to stop. When to push
dialog: yourself, and when to relax. Most
dialog: of them won't have that balance.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And how do I know if I have the
dialog: balance?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's why I'm telling you this,
dialog: because you'll turn in your
dialog: portfolio soon, and they're going
dialog: to love it. They're going to love
dialog: you. I know they will. You'll go to
dialog: LaGuardia, and you'll have fun, but
dialog: also plenty of challenges. Soon
dialog: enough you'll find out if you have
dialog: the balance.
text: The bandage is done.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: There you go. Do you know if Tony
dialog: got in?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don't know. I don't know what
dialog: he's doing.
text: Brian looks at Jake.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Son. I wish I'd done things
dialog: differently.
dialog: Shooting Script 07/27/15 99.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: With Tony, and his mother. I wish I
dialog: had told you earlier what was going
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Would it have changed anything?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No, probably not. But still.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Dad, would you mind if I give you
dialog: some advice? Would that be okay.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Don't worry so much.
text: Brian waits for more.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's all.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's a lot.
text: Brian gives Jake a kiss on the forehead, and stands up.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Dad, would you mind if I play one
dialog: of my video games? I know it's
dialog: Tuesday, and I know I should do
dialog: something more productive with my
dialog: time, but I'm kind of tired.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Of course, Son.
text: Brian finds the game controller, and hands it Jake.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Will Mom be mad?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I don't think so.
text: Shooting Script 07/27/15 100.
scene_heading: 75A INT. JARDINE APARTMENT - NIGHT 75A
text: Kathy stands outside the door, heating pad in her hands,

text: Brian wraps his arms around her and they hold each other
dialog: tightly.
scene_heading: 75B INT. JARDINE APARTMENT/JAKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 75B

scene_heading: 76 INT. BROOKLYN MUSEUM/FOYER TO BEAUX-ARTS COURT - DAY 76
text: A small group of stylish BOYS and GIRLS are sketching some of
text: the pieces in the foyer of a grand room in the Brooklyn
text: Museum. By the way they dress and move, they're clearly
text: artistic. Among them, looking more mature, more serious and
text: maybe gay, with a stylish scarf around his neck, is Jake.
dialog: Time has gone by; maybe a year or two.
scene_heading: 76A INT. BROOKLYN MUSEUM/BEAUX-ARTS COURT - DAY 76A
text: Jake and his friends enter the formal and elegant Beaux Arts
text: Court. Across the way, between arches, Jake sees a group of
text: kids in khaki's and red shirts -- Tony's Catholic school
text: uniform -- walking in the opposite direction.
text: They are with one AFRICAN BOY, who is not in uniform.
text: For a moment, he doesn't know what to do. Until, suddenly, he
text: makes up his mind, and moves.
scene_heading: 76B INT. BROOKLYN MUSEUM/BEAUX-ARTS COURT - MOMENTS LATER 76B
text: Jake walks in one direction around the courtyard.

speaker_heading: 76D

scene_heading: 76E INT. BROOKLYN MUSEUM/STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER 76E
text: Jake is sitting by himself in the stairwell.
text: He is looking straight ahead. Not sure what to do with
dialog: himself.
text: A pack of kids in khakis rush past him. We only see their
dialog: legs.
text: Jake watches them go.
speaker_heading: TONY (O.S.)
dialog: Jake! Your hair looks different.
dialog: It's Tony.
text: Jake stands up to say hello.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yours looks different too.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: I went to Africa to visit my dad.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How was it?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Amazing.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And how's your mom?
text: Shooting Script 07/27/15 102.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: She's busy. She's a real estate
dialog: agent now.
text: Jake laughs at the irony of the situation. Tony laughs with
text: him, maybe realizing it for the first time.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You could've sent me an email from
dialog: Africa.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You know me. I'm not much of a
dialog: writer...
text: Jake notices a necklace of African beads around Tony's neck.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I love that necklace.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Thanks. They make these for
dialog: tourists, they don't really wear
dialog: them there. But I like it too.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hey, you should come meet my
dialog: buddies from school.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Did you get into LaGuardia?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: That's awesome!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: There's this girl in my class, her
dialog: mother is on Broadway, she can act
dialog: better than anyone I know.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Gee, thanks.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We should all go out together
dialog: sometime.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Sure, but I met this girl in
dialog: Kinshasa, and my heart belongs to
dialog: her. Do you want to see a picture?
text: Shooting Script 07/27/15 103.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sure.

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: TONY

dialog: `bitchful'".
text: They laugh even louder, and head down to find Tony's friends.
