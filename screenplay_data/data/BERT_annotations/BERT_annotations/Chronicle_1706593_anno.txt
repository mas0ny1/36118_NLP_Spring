dialog: Josh Trank and Max Landis
text: FROM ANDREW'S FIRST CAMERA.
dialog: CUT - to indicate time lapses within a scene
scene_heading: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM
text: The room is dingy. Unkempt. The camera sits on the bed, on
text: its side, facing the door. We can hear someone moving around
text: off screen.
text: The door handle clicks; someone's trying it. Then nothing.
text: Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door.
text: Andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking. He speaks
text: with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: What do you want, I'm getting ready
dialog: for school-
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (O.S.)
dialog: Why is the door locked, unlock this
dialog: fucking door right now.
text: The bed stirs as Andrew sits down.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I said unlock this door. UNLOCK
scene_heading: THE DOOR. OPEN THE DOOR, NOW.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: You're drunk-
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (O.S.)
dialog: Listen, you don't tell me- IF I'M
speaker_heading: DRUNK, OR-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
text: It's seven thirty. In the AM.
dialog: You're drunk, dad, that's crazy-
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (O.S.)
dialog: What're you doing in there.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I'm filming this.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (O.S.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I bought a camera. I'm filming all
dialog: your shit from now on.
dialog: 2.
text: There's a beat, and then we can hear Mr. Detmer moving away
text: from the door.
scene_heading: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMER'S ROOM
text: Equally dingy. SANDRA DETMER, gaunt and sickly, is sat up in
text: bed. Andrew's filming her. She's clearly very ill, speaking
text: in a weak rasp. Andrew now holds the camera.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Mom? Will you say hi to the
dialog: camera?
speaker_heading: SANDRA DETMER
dialog: Who's the audience?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
text: The millions of people watching at
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: SANDRA DETMER
dialog: Hello world. Do I look awful?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: No, you look great.
speaker_heading: SANDRA DETMER
dialog: I've been looking a little better,
dialog: yeah?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Oh yeah, definitely.
speaker_heading: SANDRA DETMER
dialog: It's a nice camera.
scene_heading: EXT. CLARK STREET - MORNING
text: Clark Street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the
text: street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon. Andrew
text: carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into
text: the passenger side of a car.
text: In the driver's seat is MATT Garrety, 17, with messy hair.
text: He's disaffected, and more than a little cynical; the
text: reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high-school
dialog: intellectual.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I got you egg salad.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, yeah, thanks.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: They're driving.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So...Should I ask about the camera,
dialog: or-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I'm filming things now. I'm
dialog: filming everything.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're filming everything.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: For my mom. I'm trying to get
dialog: custody of her from my dad. She's
dialog: getting worse, and he's
dialog: not...helping, and this way, in
dialog: case something goes down-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He gets violent or whatever-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Right, it'd be evidence.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Evidence. But you're not with him
dialog: right now, but you're filming this.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Well, yeah, to add context.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Context. Andrew, you are...a weird
dialog: dude.
speaker_heading: CUT.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you ever read any Auguste
dialog: Comte?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He's this philosopher I'm reading.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: For school?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He's just like- his whole thing is
dialog: about being positive and like,
dialog: taking up for yourself. You should
dialog: read him, maybe, it might make you
dialog: feel- you know, improve your
dialog: outlook.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, right.
scene_heading: EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - PARKING LOT
text: Andrew's getting out of the car, but then ducks back in to
text: see Matt lighting a pipe.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Are you not coming in?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'm gonna blaze a little first,
dialog: yeah?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: You're going to miss first period-
text: Matt turns on the radio, loud.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, okay.
scene_heading: INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY
text: Andrew's filming himself putting stuff in his locker, and
text: does a quick sweep of the crowded school hallway.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: This is my school, I guess. This
dialog: is the hallway-
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Vote "Kaz!"
text: A girl suddenly approaches, awkwardly handing Andrew a flyer.
speaker_heading: GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: Vote Steve Kazinsky for Senior
dialog: class president!
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: ...yeah-
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Every vote counts.
text: Andrew films the flyer for a moment, brightly colored and
text: featuring a picture of a smiling Steve Kazinsky, before
text: something yanks the camera away.
text: For the first time we see ANDREW Detmer, 17, pale, awkward
text: and gangly, with long, stringy hair and thin, scraggly beard.
text: He looks anxious, if not afraid.
speaker_heading: BRYCE (O.S.)
dialog: Yo this camera is a piece of shit.
dialog: It's like from 2004 or some shit.
text: WAYNE, 17, big and hateable in his Ed Hardy T-shirt, appears
text: wrapping his arm roughly around Andrew.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Hey, how do I look?
dialog: (starts muscle posing)
dialog: Like this? Ooh, that's good. Like
dialog: this? That's sexy, right?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Bryce, gimme my camera back-
speaker_heading: BRYCE (O.S.)
dialog: Fuck you Andrew, shut up. This
dialog: camera's a piece of shit.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: You got me, let's go.
text: Wayne turns and knocks everything out of Andrew's locker.
text: Bryce starts to walk away with the camera.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back-
text: The camera is set down on the ground, and then abruptly
text: kicked back to Andrew. He picks it up, checking on it.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly, sad)
dialog: Oh come on...
dialog: 6.
scene_heading: EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD
text: A view from the bleachers as the soccer team practices. The
text: cheerleaders are practicing too. We cut: a different view,
dialog: lower.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: This is where I eat lunch, out here
text: on the bleachers.
scene_heading: CUT. LATER.
text: The camera's next to Andrew as he's eating, down on the
text: bench. A CHEERLEADER approaches.
speaker_heading: CHEERLEADER
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hey-
speaker_heading: CHEERLEADER
dialog: Could you not videotape us, please?
dialog: It's really fucking creepy.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I wasn't, videotaping you, so much
dialog: as I was just-
scene_heading: CHEERLEADER ANDREW
dialog: Just don't videotape- -you know, filming what I do
dialog: during the-
speaker_heading: CHEERLEADER
dialog: Don't videotape us, okay, or we'll
dialog: call security. We see you watching
dialog: us, we're not stupid, and it's
dialog: sketchy, so back off.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ...okay.
speaker_heading: CHEERLEADER
dialog: Is it on right now?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHEERLEADER
dialog: Turn it off.
text: Andrew turns off the camera.
dialog: 7.
scene_heading: INT. MATT'S CAR
text: Matt's driving. Andrew's filming from the passenger seat.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: There's a party tonight. A barn
dialog: party at Haven Hills.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I thought Haven Hills was closed.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's abandoned, yeah. That's why
dialog: it's a good place for a party. Two
text: kegs.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Why are you telling me?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You wanna go? I don't wanna go
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: ...Nah...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: When was the last time you went to
dialog: a party?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I don't like parties.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're a senior. Just come, you'll
dialog: have fun.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I'll think about it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Okay, right. Andrew, can I give
dialog: you like, a pro tip?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Keep the camera at home. It's
dialog: weird.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It has a purpose-
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'm trying to be a good cousin,
dialog: here. This is me being your
dialog: friend, yeah? Okay?
scene_heading: EXT. DETMER RESIDENCE
text: Andrew is filming as he walks along towards his house.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, what you doing?
speaker_heading: COSTLY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey nice camera bitch, gimme your
dialog: fuckin camera!
text: The camera pans up to reveal HOWARD and COSTLY, moron
text: hoodlums, along with several friends, over by a car on the
text: other side of the road, drinking forties.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Hey don't film me nigga, don't film
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: COSTLY
dialog: Hey fuck off, you better run to
dialog: your house, bitch. Run to your
text: house and lock the door.
text: Andrew just stands there filming them. Howard hurls his
text: forty at Andrew, who doesn't move; it shatters very near to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: The fuck, fuck you faggot-
text: Howard quickly starts crossing the street, and Andrew turns
text: and runs back towards his house.
scene_heading: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM
text: The camera lays on Andrew's bed again, filming the room.
text: Andrew is on his laptop at a desk, working.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm uploading what I shot
dialog: today...you have to keep a back-up,
dialog: you know.
text: The door suddenly opens, revealing MR. Adrian DETMER, 40s,
dialog: Andrew's father. He doesn't look as white trash as you'd
dialog: expect.
dialog: 9.
text: Andrew looks up at him, and then goes back to working.
text: Detmer goes over to Andrew and slaps him out of his chair.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
dialog: When I say open this door, you open
dialog: this fucking door.
text: Mr. Detmer leaves, slamming the door on his way out. Andrew
text: sits on the floor in silence.
scene_heading: EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - NIGHT
text: We're in Matt's car, driving on a dark dirt road, past an old
text: fence and rusted out farm equipment.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Are you sure it's here?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you sure it's here, this all
dialog: looks closed-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's here, calm down. Listen.
text: We can faintly hear party music.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Oh yeah.
scene_heading: EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - BARN
text: Cars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and
text: Andrew approach. We see Christmas lights strung up, and
text: there's clearly a party going on inside the barn. Kids are
text: milling about outside, too, drinking, fucking around.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Hey dude, don't follow me around
dialog: all night.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Don't follow me around all night,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: What am I supposed to do? I
dialog: thought you said you didn't want to
dialog: go alone-
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Talk to people? Have a beer, I
dialog: don't know.
speaker_heading: MONTAGED
text: FOOTAGE...
text: Andrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full
text: swing. Lots of bad footage of people talking, drinking,
text: girls dancing sexy, guys joking around. Andrew is silent and
text: detached, just filming. He sees a girl, CASEY Letter, 16,
text: filming as well. They shout over the music.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Hey, what are you filming for?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, I don't- just filming.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: What? I'm filming for my blog!
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: I have a video blog! Why are you
dialog: filming?
text: Andrew simply backs away. More footage of the party.
text: AUSTIN, 18, in an Ed Hardy shirt, comes out of nowhere. He's
text: clearly a little drunk.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Hey, were you filming my
dialog: girlfriend? Yes or no, were you
dialog: filming my girlfriend?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: No, I wasn't filming anyone
text: specific, just filming the party.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay, good, because I don't wanna
dialog: have to beat your ass.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Don't talk back to me. Don't get
dialog: smart, okay, I'm being nice here.
dialog: I'm being nice to you.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: AUSTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Say okay.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Okay-
speaker_heading: AUSTIN
dialog: Cause I know you were filming my
dialog: girlfriend dancing. I should break
dialog: your fucking nose, you know that?
dialog: You know that, I should beat your
dialog: ass right now, but I'm trying to be
dialog: nice. Fuck you.
text: Austin abruptly throws his beer on Andrew, getting some on
text: the camera, and then spits on him. Andrew backs up, shocked,
text: lowering the camera.
scene_heading: EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - EDGE OF THE WOODS
text: Andrew's out alone in a field now, furiously cleaning the
text: lens of the camera, obstructing our view. Cut to a few
text: moments later; the camera now resting in his lap or on the
text: ground. We can see the barn, the party still going on.
text: After a few moments, we can faintly hear Andrew crying.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: (loud, sudden)
dialog: Are you Andrew?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: (startled)
dialog: What-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Are you Andrew-with-the-camera?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Matt's cousin, Matt said you had a
dialog: camera?
text: The camera is picked up to reveal STEVE "Kaz" Kazinksy, 17,
text: approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing,
dialog: instantly likeable charisma.
text: He's a little drunk and giddy.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dude, are you okay?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I'm Andrew.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'm Steve Kazinsky-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: No, I know.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: ...yeah?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Everybody knows who you are.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Haha, yes, that is true. Listen,
dialog: come on, bring the camera.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: What? I don't-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Come on.
text: Steve starts off, but Andrew hesitates.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I don't-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Dude, come on, we found something.
scene_heading: EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - FIELD
text: Steve is walking ahead in the field of tall grass, toward
text: woods. It's rather dark.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Look, I don't think we're supposed
dialog: to-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Is there a light on that? On your
dialog: camera?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know-
text: The camera goes down for a moment while Andrew futzes with
text: it. The light clicks on, illuminating Steve.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Awesome.
speaker_heading: CUT.
dialog: 13.
text: They've reached the woods, and Steve is climbing over the
text: remains of a fence. The light bounces around wildly.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: What were you guys doing out here?
dialog: This is way out-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Me and your cousin were blazing a
dialog: little.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Matt's out here?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: A bunch of people were out here,
dialog: but I think they've all gone back,
dialog: now, cause we're like, obsessed
dialog: with the thing.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: They're in the woods now, thick and dizzying. It's near
text: silent but their feet crushing the Fall leaves on the ground.
text: Steve walks out ahead.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Andrew Detmer, that's right. I
dialog: remember you from homeroom,
dialog: Freshman year.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: You remember that?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, I have a memory for faces.
dialog: I'm gonna go into politics, which
dialog: is ironic because I'm soooo fucking
dialog: high right now- probably shouldn't
dialog: be letting you videotape this-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I'm gonna be so rich when you're
dialog: president, you have no idea-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, video footage of me luring
dialog: you into the woods for gay sex-
dialog: wait, hey- HEY, MATT, IS THIS IT?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Down here!
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Matt?
text: The camera turns to reveal Matt, standing next to some kind
text: of craggy hole in the ground, at the base of a hill in the
text: woods. It's big, but the darkness beyond is impenetrable to
text: the camera. It looks like a big black spot.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: There we go. There it is.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Andrew and Steve are now down with Matt by the hole. Andrew
text: is keeping the camera fixed squarely on the murky blackness,
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: STEVE (V.O.)
dialog: Where is everybody?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: They all left.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: We're not supposed to be out here.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Is it still making the sound?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah. Did you tell Andrew?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, Andrew, it's making a sound-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Here, listen.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Guys-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You've got to get really close to
dialog: hear it.
text: Andrew takes a tentative step towards the hole.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Guys, just don't like- don't push
dialog: me, or do anything like that-
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: You've got to go closer. Like
text: almost inside it.
text: There's a beat.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We're not going to push you, we
dialog: just wanna get it on tape.
text: Another pause. Andrew moves towards the hole. Even with
text: Nightvision, it's completely dark in there. A beat.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Do you hear it?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: ...It's like, whispering?
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Listen.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Singing?
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.) STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Ooooh shiiiiit- That is so fucking creepy!
text: Andrew turns the camera back to Matt and Steve.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We didn't dig the hole, man.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Is the sound on the camera?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know, probably...I mean,
dialog: it's- it's kinda loud, right?
text: Matt looks to Steve.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Do you guys wanna go in and have a
dialog: look, or what-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: No, I don't- I mean, I won't do th-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hold your nose.
dialog: 16.
text: Steve suddenly goes right into the hole, vanishing into the
dialog: darkness.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, wait-
speaker_heading: STEVE (FROM THE DARK)
dialog: (faintly)
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Steve, come on, we don't know if
dialog: it's stable in there- It's probably
dialog: just the wind, we should-
text: Andrew abruptly goes into the cave.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Andrew, hey, come on!
dialog: Don't...shit.
scene_heading: INT. THE HOLE
text: It's almost pitch black, but we can hear Andrew breathing.
text: It's claustrophobic in here. Eerily quiet. The camera
text: searches around, but the walls are tight in here, and low.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Hello-
speaker_heading: STEVE ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: (suddenly appearing) Aah!
dialog: I'm right here.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Does it go down much deeper, or-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, really far. It's not a cave,
dialog: it's like a tunnel- do you hear how
dialog: loud that's getting?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Do you think it could be like wind,
dialog: or-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Come on, man. Come on.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Then what do you think it is?
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Huh. I dunno. I don't believe in
dialog: ghosts.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Who said anything about ghosts.
text: Steve laughs, and turns, going back into the darkness.
text: Andrew follows.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Matt's face is suddenly in front of the camera.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: -shouldn't have come in here.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Steve's up ahead-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: At first I thought this was a
dialog: solutional cave, but now...I dunno,
dialog: it's like a lava tube, or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Look at the walls. Look at how
dialog: smooth they are. It's just
dialog: straight shot down, I mean, we
dialog: must've already gone forty or fifty
dialog: feet-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Don't talk about it, you're making
dialog: me nervous.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You ever hear of Plato's allegory
dialog: of the cave?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Nevermind.
speaker_heading: CUT.
dialog: 18.
text: Walking. Darkness. The cave is even tighter now. The light
text: flickers, some kind of electrical disturbance, then goes out
text: completely We hear Andrew curse, fumbling with it, and the
text: nightvision mode comes on.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: The nightvision is scrambling badly. All the forms are
dialog: distorted and then-
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Can you believe this, this is NUTS-
text: The nightvision is turned off, revealing Matt. They've come
text: into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from
text: within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise
dialog: glow.
text: They speak loudly, clearly talking over something we can't
dialog: hear.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Is that, is that showing up on the
dialog: camera?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I don't wanna film it, it's messing
dialog: with the camera-
text: Matt forcibly turns the camera, to reveal Steve standing next
text: to some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing
text: from, or maybe embedded in, the wall. Around it, and him,
text: float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.
text: Steve is clearly entranced, sweeping his hands through the
text: light.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Touch one!
text: We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora
text: borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent
text: little explosion of light, beautiful.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't...
text: A light cloud passes in front of Andrew, and we sees his hand
text: to extend to touch it. The subsequent little light burst
text: badly warps the camera, clearly permanent damage.
speaker_heading: CUT.
dialog: 19.
text: Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed
text: up close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow. The light
text: clouds have turned yellow. Matt is practically inside the
text: structure, pressing it with his palms.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: -changes color, see? It must be
text: reacting to the heat, some kind of
dialog: exothermic reaction-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: WHAT? I can't hear you over the-
dialog: you know-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Make it change again! This is
dialog: awesome!
text: Matt presses with his palms. There's a low sustained hiss as
text: the light clouds turn an angry shade of red. A stream of
text: them is released from beneath the structure. The camera
text: jerks suddenly, revealing Steve, who's clutching his ears.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: AGHHHHH!
text: Blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes, ears, mouth
text: and nose, and he buckles forwards; the camera spins wildly
text: and we see Matt seemingly FLUNG out of the crystalline
dialog: structure.
text: It pulses, and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart,
text: revealing a blinding light within which EXPLODES OUTWARD; we
text: can suddenly hear an OVERWHELMING CHOIR OF VOICES, and the
text: camera sent rocketing backwards, flipping backwards up the
dialog: tunnel-
scene_heading: CRACK. DIGITAL
speaker_heading: CODE.
scene_heading: BLACK SCREEN.
text: HOLD ON BLACK.
text: FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.
scene_heading: EXT. MATT'S BACKYARD - AFTERNOON
text: The camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, it's
text: immediately evident that this is a newer, better camera.
text: It's on a tripod, and Matt stands across a well manicured
text: backyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Rolling, yeah.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Okay, ball test. Take one.
text: A baseball comes flying in from behind the camera, nailing
text: Matt in the face; he drops like a rock.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
text: OW FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK STEVE!
dialog: UNDERHAND!
text: Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can
text: hear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Now it's Steve who stands on the yard.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go.
text: A baseball comes in from off camera, slower. It comes down
text: towards Steve, but at the last second makes a bizarre,
text: impossible course correction, FLIES UP AND HITS STEVE IN THE
speaker_heading: FACE.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
text: AGH! HEY, MATT, NOT COOL!
text: Matt rushes on, doing a victory lap, one hand holding an ice-
text: pack to his face. Again, we hear Andrew laughing.
speaker_heading: MATT
scene_heading: WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Andrew's out across the yard. He looks a little better; he's
text: gotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard, and his hair is a
text: little better kept. He nods.
text: In flies the baseball. It abruptly stops in the air, a foot
text: and a half from Andrew's face. Steve and Matt let out a
text: cheer, and the camera is yanked off the tripod, taken to show
text: a closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball and
dialog: Andrew.
dialog: 21.
text: Andrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball. A trickle
text: of blood comes out of his nose.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Ah, shit.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: The camera's on a tripod up on the back porch, filming
text: Andrew, Steve and Matt standing a triangle. They are playing
text: catch...no hands. The ball simply flies from guy to guy.
text: They drop it a few times in some cuts, but shout
text: encouragement, and are clearly having a good time.
text: Finally, they get the ball going EXTREMELY fast. Matt looks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Is-
text: Matt gets nailed in the balls, and drops as Steve and Andrew
text: rush to him, laughing.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: `In the- penis- the penis-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I thought I heard my dad...UGHHH
dialog: WHY ME AGAAAAIN!?
scene_heading: INT. MATT'S KITCHEN
text: Steve is very intently using his newfound powers to make a
text: peanut butter and jelly sandwich, knife shakily moving over
text: bread. The camera is set down on the counter, Matt and
text: Andrew watching.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: The trick is to pretend like it's
dialog: on a plate. You get it on the
dialog: plate and then you wrap the plate
dialog: around it, and you can move it
dialog: however you want.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Mhm.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I've been pretending I was like,
text: holding it in a fist, like a
text: floating hand.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah? Plate's easier for me.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Guys, check it out.
text: Steve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butter
text: floating freely. They slap together and then down onto the
text: bread, which slaps closed.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ha!
dialog: (notices his bloody nose)
dialog: Shit, shit-
scene_heading: INT. MATT'S ROOM - LATER
text: Matt's room is covered in band posters, kind of a mess.
text: Matt's sitting on the floor by a desk, slowly assembling a
text: LEGO set with his telekinetic abilities. Andrew's filming
text: from the bed, where he's laying down.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Try to imagine that your squeezing
dialog: the entire piece in your hand.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That's what I'm doing, it's just,
dialog: it's hard. You're better at this
dialog: than me, you do it.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: Really?
text: Andrew points at the lego set, and it flies together.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (wowed, laughing)
dialog: Dude, holy shit!
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Andrew and Matt are laughing as Steve enters, holding out his
dialog: cell phone.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Guys, listen, listen. Samantha.
text: Steve puts his voice-mail on speaker. SAMANTHA Pezon, 16,
text: sounds a bit frustrated.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA (ON PHONE)
dialog: I know you're over at that guy
dialog: Matt's house right now, okay, cause
dialog: they said you didn't show up for
dialog: soccer practice, but you said the
dialog: only reason you couldn't come see
dialog: Bound By Love with me was because
dialog: of soccer practice, so...You know,
dialog: I just, I don't know what to think.
dialog: I feel like we never hang out
dialog: anymore, you've just been hanging
dialog: out with those two guys for the
dialog: last like three weeks, and I...ugh,
dialog: call me back.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What would you suggest, as like, a
dialog: course of action for me, here?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Why are you asking US for advice on
dialog: girls?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Because we're his mistress.
text: Steve laughs.
scene_heading: INT. STEVE'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Steve is driving Andrew home.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: -new camera's working out for you,
dialog: that's good.
speaker_heading: CUT.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to admit, though, I don't
dialog: understand the filming thing.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I told you, it's just my thing for
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You don't feel like it's a little
dialog: weird? Like it puts a barrier
dialog: between you and everything?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Maybe I want a barrier.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Okay. I respect that.
speaker_heading: CUT.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: My dad is actually a fireman, or
dialog: was, I don't know. He got injured
dialog: like two years ago, and now they
dialog: just pay him out of, like,
dialog: insurance. He doesn't do anything,
dialog: I mean he goes out during the day,
dialog: but I don't know where. He drinks
dialog: a lot.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: So how do you pay for your shit?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I do computer repair, and stuff. I
dialog: actually make a lot of money...
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: What about your mom.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: My mom has spinal meningitis, she's-
dialog: she can't work or anything, and the
dialog: insurance doesn't cover all of her
dialog: medicine, so a lot of my money has
dialog: to go into that. I figure if I get
dialog: enough on camera, maybe I can, I
dialog: dunno, get custody of her or
dialog: something.
text: Steve mulls this over.
speaker_heading: CUT.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I've actually been having some
dialog: problems with my parents, too.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Nothing like yours, though. Not-
dialog: Never mind.
text: There's a long beat.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: They've just been fighting a lot.
dialog: I think my mom is cheating on my
dialog: dad.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: ...That's intense.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah. I know. I'm actually, yeah,
dialog: I'm sure my mom is cheating on my
dialog: dad.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: How-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I just, you know, I saw some stuff.
dialog: It's weird, you don't think about
dialog: your parents as like...people, or
dialog: whatever. I don't know.
text: The two guys drive in silence.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't tell anybody about that-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Haha no of course, no way.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Good.
scene_heading: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM
text: It's dark. We can hear shouting from elsewhere in the house;
dialog: "useless bitch," "carry your ass long enough," etc. Andrew
text: reaches over and turns off the camera.
scene_heading: EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD - BLEACHERS
text: Matt, Andrew and Steve are eating lunch on the bleachers.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: See last night, alone, I got my
text: whole bed off the ground. No
text: nosebleed.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, I was doing weights, too.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Weights, like-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Free-weights, a barbell. I got up
dialog: to two hundred pounds before I
dialog: bled.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So it's, yeah, this is my theory-
text: it's like a vagina. Like it's
dialog: elastic, but if you stretch it too
dialog: far too quick it'll tear-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Ew-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And that's why we're getting
dialog: better. We're loosening up.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Couldn't that metaphor just be for
dialog: any muscle in the human body, like
dialog: working out or-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: No, I like braingina. Braingina is
dialog: the shiiiiit.
text: Steve floats up a bunch of chips from his bag, and then rapid
text: fires them into his mouth.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I think it's time we took this out
text: of the backyard.
text: Matt and Steve look confused.
scene_heading: INT. STEVE'S CAR
text: Steve is driving, Matt's shotgun, Andrew's filming from the
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: If anyone criticizes you, just call
dialog: them a hater. It's like calling
dialog: someone a racist, they'll just drop
dialog: whatever they're complaining about
dialog: and be like "I'M NOT A HATER."
dialog: Nobody wants to be a hater.
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: EXT. WAL-MART
text: Matt and Steve are walking in, Andrew lagging behind filming.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Just stay back a little ways, yeah-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I got it.
scene_heading: INT. WAL-MART
text: The guys are trying to stay out of sight, looking down an
text: aisle where shoppers stand.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
text: That girl, with the cart.
text: A frumpy woman with a shopping cart suddenly starts pulling
text: on the cart. It suddenly breaks away from her, and goes
text: careening down the aisle by itself, her chasing after it. We
text: can hear the guys cracking up, trying to stay quiet.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
text: She's chasing- she's chasing it-
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Toy aisle. A toddler is looking at teddy bears.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I got this.
text: One of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life, waving at the
text: little boy. The little boy is wowed. The teddy bear suddenly
text: takes off and flies through the air. Again the stifled
dialog: laughter.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Oh my god Andrew, look-
text: Andrew pans up to reveal a woman at the end of the aisle; she
text: saw everything, and is looking around, wide eyed.
speaker_heading: CUT.
dialog: They're by the check out.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: See that guy chewing gum?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Umm...
dialog: (camera finds the guy)
dialog: Got him.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'm gonna get the gum right out of
dialog: his mouth- watch this.
text: There's suddenly a little air ripple in front of the man's
text: mouth, and he's yanked face first into the gum and candy
text: rack, which all crashes apart. The guys all crack up and
dialog: start running.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: GUYS, WHY ARE WE RUNNING!? We
dialog: don't need to run, we don't need to
dialog: run!
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - SUNSET
text: Matt sits on the hood of a car. He and Andrew are flinging
text: rocks with their powers.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That was a good one, you got that
dialog: one far.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Matt.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you like me?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sure, yeah. I mean, I didn't,
dialog: always-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Don't get mad, I mean, I like you
dialog: now, I like you a lot. You're
dialog: just, you're not super easy to talk
dialog: to. You've got a lot of-
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: You're an asshole.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: See, that's what I'm saying.
dialog: You're hostile, man.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know, you...If you hadn't
dialog: invited me to that party, none of
dialog: this would've happened.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Matt laughs.
scene_heading: INT. MATT'S CAR - AFTERNOON - WAL-MART PARKING LOT
text: None of the guys are visible. They're filming a woman park
dialog: her car.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: I just always feel like I miss
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: We were just sitting around
dialog: throwing rocks, it was nothing.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, until all those chicks showed
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: What? Shut up.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, here we go, here we go.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Are you sure there's no one around-
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: There's no one, I just looked, just
dialog: go, ready?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, Andrew, remember, get under
dialog: it, you're the strongest, Steve get
dialog: the sides, I'll get the front and
dialog: back, we gotta do this quick.
dialog: Countdown. Three. Two. One. GO.
text: The car the woman parked shakily lifts off, and immediately
text: dips right.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Steve Steve Steve-
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Got it, got it.
text: Silence, and we watch as the car gets to about twelve feet in
text: the air, makes a full 180 degree rotation, and then wobbles
text: through the air over to a spot several spaces away, and then
text: sets down, neatly in place.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D) MATT (O.S.)
text: FUCK YEAH! BOOYAH! YES! FUCK YES! OH SHIT,
dialog: blood-
scene_heading: EXT. WAL-MART - PARKING LOT - SHORTLY THEREAFTER
text: Matt is sitting against the car with a wad of kleenex on his
text: nose, soaked with blood. Steve is leaning nearby, with a
text: brown paper napkin.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My braingina is having like
dialog: a...face period.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah, you got some from your ears,
dialog: too. You've gotta start working it
dialog: out more, Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah man, in between my yoga.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: You just need focus, Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ha.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: You're lucky you got the kleenex,
dialog: I'm stuck with the taco bell
text: wrapper.
dialog: 31.
text: Andrew holds out said wrapper in front of the camera.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That's like, at least twice as much
dialog: blood as I usually see on a taco
text: bell wrapper.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Guys, guys. Look.
text: The camera moves around to show the woman returning to the
text: space where her car was parked. She stops, baffled, and
text: looks around. We hear the guys stifle laughter.
text: She notices her car parked up ahead and walks over to it,
text: looking around. Andrew tries to get a better angle, and she
text: notices him, and stares.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Ignore us!
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: We're
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mormons!
text: The woman stares a moment longer, and goes to her car.
scene_heading: INT. MATT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Matt's driving, Steve's shotgun, Andrew filming from the
text: back. It's raining.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: -sfucking insane, we just changed
dialog: her life. We did-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
text: Her face, I can't get her face out
dialog: of my head.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: That was fucking great. I mean,
dialog: this just gives me so many ideas,
dialog: already, stuff we could do-
text: There's honking from outside.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Oh come on, what is this?
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: He's like right on your bumper,
dialog: too.
text: Matt rolls down the window and gives the signal to pass.
text: More honking.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Can you fucking believe this guy?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: He's just some asshole redneck,
dialog: look at him. He's fucking with us.
text: They are driving out over a bridge in the woods.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I don't know what to do, what
dialog: should I-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Here, take the camera, take the
dialog: camera.
text: He hands off the camera to Steve; now we see Andrew sitting
text: in the back seat. Behind him, through the back window, we
text: can see a pick-up truck, honking, way too close.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Abracadabra.
text: Andrew flicks his hand at the truck. The effect is
text: instantaneous: THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK CAVES IN LIKE IT JUST
text: HIT A BRICK WALL, WHAM, AND SENDING IT CRASHING OFF THE
text: BRIDGE, OUT AND DOWN AND INTO THE WATER.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: ...I...what...
scene_heading: EXT. THE BRIDGE
text: The camera is being held loosely at Steve's side;
text: everything's upside-down, and we can't see anything, but can
text: hear the guys are clearly freaked out.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: What the fuck did you do, man, what
dialog: the fuck-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I didn't mean to, I didn't-
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Fuck! SHIT! What's wrong with
dialog: you, look at this, fuck!
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Is he still in there? If he's in
dialog: there we have to get him out-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Guys, just calm down, I'm sorry,
dialog: okay-
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Fuck that, take your fucking
dialog: camera.
text: The camera is shoved to Andrew's chest, and lingers there a
text: moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge;
text: the truck is already sinking in the water fifteen or so feet
text: below. We tilt up to see Steve taking off his jacket.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: You don't have to- I mean I can-
text: Andrew raises out a hand, trying to telekinetically lift the
text: car. It rattles, and then Andrew groans in pain.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Andrew, just stop, just stop doing
dialog: things.
text: Steve dives off the side of the bridge. Andrew films him for
text: a moment, swimming to the car.
scene_heading: INT. MATT'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Andrew's filming Matt, who looks angry as he drives very
dialog: quickly.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Are you mad?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Stop, just stop.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER SIDE ROAD
text: Matt and Andrew pull up to see Steve dragging the REDNECK
text: ASSHOLE out of the water. They hurry out of the car.
speaker_heading: CUT.
dialog: 34.
text: Steve has the guy on the shore. He's dazed and bleeding.
scene_heading: REDNECK ASSHOLE
dialog: -what happened, cause...I don't
dialog: know....my truck, my truck...
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Is he okay?
text: Steve just stares directly at Andrew. Andrew pans to reveal
text: Matt, on a cell phone.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yes, just past White Crescent
dialog: bridge. Down by the- yes-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Is that the cops, are you calling
dialog: the cops?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: Yeah, just come- no, I don't know.
dialog: I don't know, maybe internal
dialog: bleeding, or-
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Later. The cops and an ambulance have arrived. An officer
text: is talking to Matt, Steve and Andrew; the camera is held low.
speaker_heading: LOCAL OFFICER
dialog: -looks like he'll be okay. Lucky
dialog: you guys were here. Is that on?
dialog: You can go ahead and turn that off.
text: The camera shuts off.
scene_heading: EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Matt looks FURIOUS, while Steve just looks uncomfortable and
text: freaked out. Matt's car is parked nearby.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I don't see how you guys can be so
dialog: angry-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You don't see how we can be angry?
dialog: You put a man in the hospital for
dialog: fucksakes. You put a man in the
dialog: hospital, you hurt somebody-
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: He was being an asshole- he- I
dialog: didn't mean to-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Which part of that do you mean, do
dialog: you mean he was being an asshole,
dialog: or was it an accident? Was it an
dialog: accident, Andrew, cause you're the
dialog: strongest. Listen, with this, we
dialog: can't fuck around, ever.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Then what've we been doing, we've
dialog: been fucking around-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: NOT LIKE THAT, ANDREW. That's- you
dialog: can't use it on people, or hurt
dialog: people like- Steve, help me out.
text: Steve seems lost for words.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We need rules, okay. Rule #1, you
dialog: can't use it on living things.
dialog: Rule #2, you can't use it when
dialog: you're angry-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: You can't just declare rules,
dialog: you're not-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I will fucking declare rules, okay?
dialog: If we keep going, and getting
dialog: stronger, we need rules. We need
dialog: rules.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Damn it Andrew turn off the cam-
text: SNAP TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM
text: It's morning. The camera lays on the bed. Andrew can be
dialog: heard breathing.
scene_heading: CUT. LATER.
dialog: 36.
text: The camera moves, and is picked up, following a spider as it
text: moves across the floor. It crawls up onto the side of the
text: bed, then onto the sheets. Andrew's finger points at it.
text: The spider is telekinetically lifted into the air. It hangs
text: struggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid.
text: He spreads his fingers, and the spider abruptly separates
text: into all of its component parts. They stop moving, hanging
text: lifeless.
text: Andrew's home phone rings, and he drops the spider. Rings
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (O.S.)
dialog: (from downstairs)
dialog: Andrew! Answer the fucking phone!
scene_heading: INT. MATT'S CAR - STEVE'S STREET
text: Andrew's filming Matt from shotgun.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Did he say what it was about? When
dialog: he called, what did he say?
text: Matt's quiet.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you still mad at me?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'm not mad.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You seem mad.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: ...Power corrupts, is all I'm
dialog: saying, man.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What does that even mean?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I just mean that we have to think
dialog: about things more now, okay? We
dialog: can't just DO things, we have to
dialog: think first.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ...I understand.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's just- nah, nevermind, we're
dialog: here.
scene_heading: EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: The house is big and nice, somewhat isolated. Matt is
text: walking up ahead of Andrew to the door.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey kids.
text: Matt stops, and both Matt and Andrew look around.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Steve? Where are you?

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Just try it, it's easy.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: That doesn't look easy.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You throw yourself at the ground.
dialog: You just fall, and catch yourself,

dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Matt hurls himself at the ground, WHAM. Cut, and again,

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Let me try-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah. I'm done for now.
speaker_heading: CUT.

speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: No cars, no cars, go.
dialog: 38.
text: Andrew throws himself forward. And stops, hanging in mid
dialog: air.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Whoaaaamygod...whoaaa...
text: Matt moves in for a closer look at floating Andrew, and gives

speaker_heading: MATT

scene_heading: EXT. SKY
text: At first it's not clear what we're looking at, just blue sky.
text: Wind is very loud. The camera pans down to reveal we're FIVE
text: THOUSAND FEET IN THE AIR, in a clearing between two larger
text: cloudbanks.
text: The camera pans all the way down to show Andrew's dangling
text: feet, and below them, the impossibly far drop. We can hear
dialog: Andrew laugh.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: We can see Steve and Matt, nearby, now wearing winter-coats
text: and hats to keep warm. They're playing catch with a
text: football. Steve tosses it to Andrew, who actually goes into
text: a short dive to catch it. He looks up to see Steve and Matt
text: distantly cheering and waving their approval.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Steve's holding the camera, filming Andrew attempting a few
text: fancy moves, but he's a clumsy flier. Matt does a few neater
text: tricks in some clips.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Matt, you're finally good at
dialog: something!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (loud)
dialog: What? The wind!
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: I said you're an idiot!
text: Matt gives the thumbs up, and Steve laughs.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's about aerodynamics! If I put

dialog: can go way faster, cause it cuts
dialog: wind resistance!
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah! Definitely!
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Steve and Matt are seen flying around, Steve further away,
text: near a large cloud bank. Matt is using his abilities to
text: shape cloud fluff into an M. There is a humming, rattling
text: sound, slightly audible even over the deafening wind.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Guys, do you hear that?
text: Neither of the guys can hear him. Steve however stops in the
text: distance, looking around. He shouts something, inaudible.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: What? I can't hear you!
text: Steve pantomimes, pointing at his ear and shrugging.
text: A BOEING 737 BLOWS OUT OF THE CLOUDBANK BEHIND STEVE. He's
text: spun like a top in its wake, and drops like a rock.
text: Suddenly we're launched downwards, and after a moment, the
text: camera disconnects from Andrew, and we see him zooming ahead.
text: The camera, in free-fall, spins wildly, then suddenly it
text: swims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in
text: some tall grass. Less than a second later, Andrew and Steve
text: come falling down into the grass and roll roughly, splitting
dialog: apart.
text: They lay there, breathing hard. Andrew sits up, coughing;
text: his eyes, nose and mouth bleeding. Steve suddenly leaps up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: WOO! HOLY FUCKING FUCK! I COULDA
text: DIED, MAN! I ALMOST FUCKING DIED!
text: Steve grabs Andrew, shaking and hugging him.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: You saved my life, dude! Andrew,
dialog: you saved my fucking life! Is that-
dialog: Holy shit is that the camera?! You
dialog: AND THE CAMERA!?
dialog: caught me
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (exhausted)
dialog: Y- yeah-
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: FUCKIN' AMAZING!
text: Matt touches down behind them, frantic.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What happened, are you-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Ahhhhh!
text: Steve joy-tackles Matt to the ground.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: What the hell, what the hell-
text: Andrew, laughing tiredly, rolls over and grabs the camera.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: They're all standing in the field; Steve is still wigging
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: This is what people have wanted
dialog: forever, since like caveman times!

dialog: jesus christ, I can't even-
dialog: Everything is fucking great! I CAN

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: CUT.
text: We cut between three sing alongs; "Shake That" by Nate Dogg

dialog: lyrics), "How You Remind Me" by Nickelback, and "Macho Man"
dialog: by The Village People.
scene_heading: INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: The guys are in that sleepy mode, now. Andrew's filming, but
text: not really focusing on anything. Matt's sprawled out on a
text: couch opposite him. Steve's in a chair nearby.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: But how does she not notice?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, I mean, she notices that it's
dialog: gotten better, definitely. You
dialog: just have to be subtle.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: That's so cool. Doesn't that count
dialog: as breaking rule #1 though?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Pfff, technicalities.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Man, I haven't had sex since

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
speaker_heading: YO.
speaker_heading: MATT

scene_heading: EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - THE CLEARING - MORNING

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I feel stupid now that I was scared
dialog: to come back.
speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm live on scene here with Matt
dialog: and Andrew, boys, can you tell us
dialog: what's happening?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well, uh, it would appear that a
dialog: Virgin Mary has appeared in the
text: maple syrup on a young local man's
dialog: pancake.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: In a second it will, wait...
text: Matt focuses, and we see his syrup form a Virgin Mary.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: That is, that is some very uh,

dialog: on there.
speaker_heading: CUT.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well, when I was really little, I
dialog: wanted to be police officer.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, no shit?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Fuck you, pig.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No, I just really got into on the
dialog: idea of altruism, you know?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What's that mean?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Like making things better for
dialog: everyone.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: So what, you wanna do like, a
dialog: charity? That's lame.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Why is that lame?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I dunno.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I mean, I'm not gonna- it doesn't
dialog: matter, you know. I'm never gonna
dialog: get out of this piece of shit town.
dialog: You know, we're all just little
dialog: pieces. One person can't really
dialog: make a difference. I used to think-
dialog: I don't know. I don't know.
text: Matt telekinetically lifts a spoon and rockets it at the
text: camera; it plinks off.
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: AAH! DOUCHEBAG!
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Now Matt has the camera, filming Steve.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: So what's it feel like to be good
dialog: at everything?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'm not good at everything-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Name something you're bad at.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I'm not GOOD at everything, I just
dialog: do my best at everything. That's
dialog: what it's about. I mean you talk
dialog: about philosophy and shit all the
dialog: time, but you never really do
dialog: anything. Have you even applied to
dialog: colleges yet?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I'll get to it-
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You could use some of that, man,
dialog: I'm just saying.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Oh yeah? Well you could use some
dialog: shut the fuck up.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: You lack initiative.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You lack...a dick.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - LATER
text: The guys are walking along. Andrew's holding the camera
text: loosely, not really caring, they're chatting, it's chill.

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Shit man, I got my mom's birthday,
dialog: I gotta go.
speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: You still haven't told her?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Nah, no way. She'd freak out.
speaker_heading: CUT.
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom's like, never home anymore. I
dialog: mean, you saw how my dad is, he's
dialog: just quiet. Sits around. I don't
dialog: know. And talking to him about it
dialog: is just pointless. He's got
dialog: nothing to say.
speaker_heading: CUT.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: And it's bad, because her pain gets
dialog: real bad, you know, and we can't
dialog: afford the good meds anymore. When
dialog: I was little it wasn't as bad, but
dialog: even then dad was still, you know,
dialog: the way he is. I don't know. I
dialog: don't know anymore. I don't know
dialog: how to feel.
speaker_heading: CUT.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It'll be fine, dude. You'll figure
dialog: it out.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I hope so.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hey, I wanted to ask you, winter
dialog: break's coming up...You wanna do
dialog: the talent show with me? Get you
dialog: out there, you know, meet some new
dialog: people.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: No, I- I mean, no, that's not- I'm
dialog: really shy, and I don't have any
dialog: talents, or-
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Yes you do, you have a talent, you
dialog: have a talent.

dialog: You leave the house, and who the
dialog: fuck is giving you rides to school?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Matt.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
dialog: No, wrong. Something's fucking
dialog: going on with you, you can't hide
dialog: it. Think you can slink around,
dialog: sneaking- sneaking around the
dialog: house, smiling, I know your shit.
dialog: And we ain't got no more fucking
dialog: money for your mother's pain
dialog: medication, either.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ...I'm sorry, I'll try to-
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
dialog: Sorry isn't good enough, fuck up!
dialog: You're a fuck up. You fuck
dialog: everything up. Put that fucking
dialog: camera away-
scene_heading: INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - AUDITORIUM
text: At first, it's just a shot off Matt's feet, the camera
text: pointing down, and we can hear hub-bub all around. It goes
text: to nightvision for a moment, then over-exposes, then back to
dialog: normal.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: (grumbling)
dialog: Fuck...the stupid...
text: The camera is levelled, showing a high-school auditorium's
text: stage. A group of kids are playing screamo music. Cut, a
text: little later. A girl is singing. Cut. Casey, the girl with
text: the videoblog from the barn party, is doing hip-hop booty
text: dancing. She's good. The camera lingers on her.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...s'fuckin awesome...
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: It's a few minutes later. "Techno-Syndrome" (MORTAL KOMBAT!)
text: begins to play. There's a beat, and then Steve, in a tuxedo,
text: rushes out onto stage. The applause is DEAFENING, girls
dialog: screaming, etc.
text: He raises his hands for silence, and then "presents" Andrew,
text: also in a tuxedo. Mixed reaction from the crowd. Andrew's
text: carrying a deck of cards; he fumbles them, they spill onto
text: the floor. Audience laughter; Steve throws up his arms in
text: exasperation.
dialog: 50.
text: Andrew shrugs, and all the cards leap back up into his hands.
text: There's a beat, and then the audience goes APESHIT.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes! Fuck yes!
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Andrew is juggling, six balls at once. Steve is drinking a
text: soda, and offers Andrew the soda. Andrew is annoyed. Steve
text: pantomimes joy at not having to give up his soda. Andrew
text: stops juggling, leaving all the balls hanging in the air, and
text: snatches away Steve's soda.
text: Steve lunges after him and gets back his soda, only to have
text: all the balls drop out of the air and hit him. The audience
text: is LOSING THEIR FREAKING MINDS.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: People around Matt are buzzing about how awesome it is.
text: Andrew is transporting buckets of water across the stage,
text: spilling water everywhere. Steve is pantomiming anger at the
text: shoddy job he's doing. Andrew pantomimes "Well, you try."
text: Steve tries, but trips and falls, sending the contents of the
text: bucket flying out over the audience-
text: -only for it to seemingly REWIND back into the bucket! The
text: place GOES BERZERK.
speaker_heading: CUT.

dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, it did- it did feel like
dialog: that. All the girls screaming-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Ah, see, here's the first stage of
dialog: your downfall, hubris.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: What's "hubris?"
speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)

speaker_heading: SAMANTHA

text: Or "You fucking rock!" Andrew sheepishly acknowledges this.
text: Finally, a very hot girl with pink hair and a monroe piercing
text: is talking. This is MONICA, 16. She's a little drunk.
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Just fucking amazing. Magic is so
dialog: hot. Do you know, me and my mom,
dialog: in Vegas, went to a magic show, but
dialog: they didn't have anything like

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, well, we spend a lot of time

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MONICA

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)

speaker_heading: CUT.
text: More shots of the party, of Monica talking. She entreats

dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: SOME GUY
dialog: And now, you get a special treat,

dialog: piss.
text: Matt snatches away the camera from him.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Matt's walking around with the camera now he films people
text: dancing, talking, a people taking shots. Casey passes,
text: filming for her video blog. Matt's camera follows her, but

dialog: shots anyway.
speaker_heading: CUT.
speaker_heading: STEVE

text: and picks it up.
scene_heading: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM
text: In the squalid living room of the Detmer residence. The
text: camera is being held off at an angle by Mr. Detmer, as Andrew
text: tries to get it back. It moves around a bit, so Andrew and
text: his father are both on/off screen.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
dialog: -think you can fucking use me,
dialog: you're abusive, you're a fucking
dialog: user little piece of shit. I went
dialog: through your camera.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What'd you...You- what'd you see?
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
dialog: Just you fucking being a drunk
dialog: mess, spending my money, drinking
dialog: with your fucking friends-
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I didn't spend any of your money,
speaker_heading: RICHARD-
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
dialog: Cause I don't have any fucking
dialog: money to spend, it all goes to

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
dialog: -now we can't afford your mother's
dialog: pain meds anymore, up there
dialog: screaming- did you just- what THE
dialog: FUCK DID YOU JUST CALL ME? CALL ME
dialog: A FUCKING IDIOT?
text: Mr. Detmer hurls the camera directly into Andrew's face. It
text: knocks him down and clatters to the floor.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (clutching his face)
dialog: You asshole, you fucking crazy
dialog: asshole-
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
text: GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! YOU'RE DONE
text: LIVING HERE, GET OUT!
text: Detmer rushes up to Andrew and slaps him, and again, and
text: again, and again, and WHAM! Andrew backhands Detmer HARD,
text: flooring him. Andrew turns and picks up the camera, leveling
text: it coolly on his father as he tries to stand.
text: Andrew's arm snakes out and grabs Detmer by his throat,
text: lifting him easily and slamming him against the wall.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't- can't move-
scene_heading: ANDREW MR. DETMER
dialog: I COULD CRUSH YOU. YOU KNOW Get- off- let me go- you're
dialog: THAT, I CAN FUCKING CRUSH hurting me-
dialog: YOU. I CAN KILL YOU WITHOUT *
text: EVEN FUCKING TOUCHING YOU.
text: Andrew turns and flings Mr. Detmer into the sofa, which flips
text: on the impact. We can hear Andrew's gasping sobs, panicked,
text: as he turns, runs out of the house, and LAUNCHES INTO THE
speaker_heading: AIR.
dialog: 57.
scene_heading: EXT. THE THUNDERSTORM
text: Andrew's just below the clouds, massive dark and ominous
text: above him. It's clearly not safe, rain and wind whipping his
text: body, lightning crackling inside the clouds. We can hear him
text: breathing hard.
text: He touches the bottom of a cloud, and gets a powerful
text: electric shock, forcing him to back off a tiny bit.
speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
text: HEY! HEY ASSHOLE!
text: The camera turns, showing Steve, in a rainslicker, flying up
dialog: to meet Andrew.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: We have to get down from here right

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I don't fucking care!? You're my

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: ...What?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I hang out with you and Matt
dialog: practically every fucking day! You
dialog: think I talk to anyone else about

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: I'm an idiot. I'm sorry Steve, oh

speaker_heading: STEVE

speaker_heading: ANDREW

scene_heading: EXT. CEMETARY - DAY
text: It's a gray, dark day. A funeral is in progress; we're

dialog: 59.
text: A large picture of Steve is on a stand as the priest reads a
text: eulogy. Andrew's camera movements are rigid again, tight and
dialog: confined, back to how they were when we first started.
text: We see Steve's mother and father. His mother is sobbing.
text: His father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket.
text: Steve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away.
text: There's Samantha, crying uncontrollably. The camera passes
dialog: Matt...
text: Who's staring directly at us.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Andrew walks along in the cemetary, filming tombstones.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: What are you doing? Filming

text: The camera looks up at Matt. He's keeping his distance.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MATT
text: Turn off the camera.

speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)

dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: How do you get struck by lightning
dialog: during a storm with no recorded
dialog: lightning strikes?
dialog: (waits, nothing)
dialog: You can look that up online, you
dialog: know, they keep track of it. I
dialog: looked it up. Zero. And they find
dialog: him out in a field, why would Steve
text: go out in the middle of a field
dialog: during a lightning storm?

text: Matt, very upset, suddenly advances on Andrew, trying to pull

speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: (breaking down a little)
dialog: What did you do, Andrew? What am I
dialog: supposed to do? Who am I supposed
dialog: to tell, about this, man? Who do I
dialog: tell? I mean- I don't, I don't

text: The camera and Andrew suddenly launch into the air, rocketing
text: away from Matt.
scene_heading: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM
text: The camera is on Andrew's dresser, near his mirror. Andrew
text: suddenly appears, holding a kitchen knife.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (addressing the camera)
dialog: -wanted to show you what I was
dialog: talking about.
text: Andrew takes the camera, and angles it down at his arm. He
text: takes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh
text: of his wrist. He drags the blade down hard, all the way to
text: his elbow...but no cut appears. He then violently jabs
text: himself several times...but no penetration.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: See, it's- I put a little sheet
dialog: between myself and the knife, and
dialog: the barrier, the sheet, is too
dialog: strong. The knife can't cut it. I
dialog: mean like, what I'm saying is if I
dialog: concentrate, I can't be hurt. I
dialog: can't be injured. Because of the
dialog: little sheet.
scene_heading: EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD

scene_heading: INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY
text: Andrew is putting his stuff away in his locker. He's
text: suddenly shoved into the locker roughly. The camera turns,
text: revealing Wayne walking away.
text: The camera scans the mostly empty hallway quickly, then goes
text: back to Wayne, now almost twenty feet away.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Wayne!
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: What, you got a probl-
text: One of Andrew's hands flicks out, and Wayne's mouth suddenly
text: gushes blood. Wayne screams, falling, and is immediately
dialog: tended to by other students.
scene_heading: INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - BATHROOM STALL
text: Andrew has laid out three small bloody objects on the back of
text: the toilet, and presents each one to the camera one by one.
text: They're Wayne's bloody teeth.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: See, this one, I got clean, cause I
dialog: did a little lasso around the root,
dialog: but these two, they're broken cause

speaker_heading: FERNANDEZ
dialog: Could you put the camera away?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: No, I'm filming this. I film
dialog: everything.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: FERNANDEZ
dialog: I understand that things have been
dialog: very hard for you recently, Andrew,
dialog: but the camera kind of- it
dialog: alienates a little, you know?
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: What did you want to talk about?
speaker_heading: FERNANDEZ
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There's concern for your grades,
dialog: Andrew. And as far as I know
dialog: you've yet to apply to any
dialog: colleges, so-
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: It's not doable. Financially,
dialog: they're not- I mean, my dad didn't
dialog: go to college either.
speaker_heading: FERNANDEZ
dialog: Well, yes, but I still think it's
dialog: worth thinking about. There are

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I don't need college, Mr.
dialog: Fernandez.
speaker_heading: FERNANDEZ
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think that's a very close-minded
dialog: attitude, Andrew. I know that you
dialog: come from a difficult background,
dialog: and I know how horrible the pain
dialog: can be when you lose a friend. But
dialog: I don't think you should let this
dialog: make you lose hope. I mean, this
dialog: is your future. You don't want to
dialog: compromise your future.

dialog: Andrew?
scene_heading: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM
text: The camera is sitting on the floor. We can hear screaming
text: from downstairs. Andrew picks up the camera, and goes to the

text: from behind the camera, leaving it hanging in the air.
dialog: 64.
text: He stands looking at himself, and then the camera. The
text: camera turns to face Andrew. He doesn't look good, but gives
text: a weak smile.
scene_heading: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - MS. DETMER'S ROOM
text: We're peeking in through the door. We can see Sandra Detmer

text: The door closes.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT
text: The junkyard is filled with junked cars, metal garbage, old
text: equipment. The camera sits awkwardly on the hood of a
text: wrecked car as Andrew fidgets to get it mounted. The area is
text: lit by lights from the main building, not too far away, but
dialog: you can tell he's not supposed to be in here.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Andrew moves out in front of the camera. He telekinetically
text: pulls an old car forward, and lifts it easily. He moves it
text: left, moves it right, rolls it, sets it back down.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Andrew is sitting, resting, tired. He speaks directly to the
dialog: camera.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I've been doing a lot of reading,
dialog: like you know, online, about
dialog: evolution, and the way it works,
dialog: and you know, natural selection.
dialog: The uh...
dialog: (cut)
dialog: The strongest animals will always
dialog: survive, and they're the ones that
dialog: you know, will prosper, or grow,
dialog: and survive, by feeding on the
dialog: smaller animals. And as humans we-
dialog: see, there's...uh-
dialog: (cut)
dialog: There's this thing called an Apex
dialog: Predator, and basically what that
dialog: is the most powerful predator in an
dialog: ecosystem. And humans, you know,
dialog: we're the apex predator, because
dialog: there's nothing that preys on us,
dialog: cause of weapons and stuff. But if
dialog: something could, I bet it would.
dialog: I...
dialog: (cut)
dialog: I mean, what I'm trying to say is,
text: a lion doesn't feel guilty when it
dialog: kills a gazelle. You don't feel
dialog: guilty when you squash a fly, you
dialog: know- I think that means
dialog: something. I think it really means
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Andrew's back out with the car. He lifts it again, then
text: makes a quick "squeezing" motion. As he does this, the car
text: violently compresses down to the size of a basketball.
text: Andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile, which
text: collapses loudly.
text: Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but as
text: he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, which
text: bites him twice before he's able to fling it off.
text: The dog recovers, and rushes Andrew, who raises a hand,
text: blasting the dog across the yard, killing it instantly.
text: Andrew turns and looks at the camera, and it turns off.

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I am so sick of being filmed, you
dialog: have no idea, Casey-
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)
dialog: No I know, but I'm not going to use

speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)
dialog: (awed)
dialog: Holy shit, Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: COME ON! BRING IT ON!
text: Casey fires several more shots, Matt catches them

dialog: Casey.
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)

text: all around me, and I'm zooming past
dialog: them; everything is really like

dialog: then...I don't know, just the main
dialog: part is that I'm out and there are
text: the stars and they just look like
dialog: millions of little points of
text: light...And Steve is there.
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)
dialog: Steve is there?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah but he feels like he's not
text: part of it. Like he's there
dialog: separately, inside my head. Andrew
dialog: is there too. I don't know. I'm
dialog: worried about Andrew.
dialog: (beat, slyly)
dialog: Why don't you put the camera away?
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That doesn't- that actually sounds

speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Okay, and the copay on that
dialog: is...Seven hundred and fifteen
dialog: dollars, eighty three cents.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: I have to come back.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Okay, we'll hold it for you.
scene_heading: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM - LATER
text: Andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave.
text: His stereo plays David Bowie. Once his dad's car is gone,
text: Andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the
text: mirror, and leaves the room.
text: Time passes, and Andrew reappears, now dragging a crate. He
text: opens it, and pulls out his father's fireman's uniform. We
text: do short-space time cuts as he takes out the jacket, looks at
text: it, and turns it inside out, so that the metallic fireproof
text: inner lining is exposed.
text: "Ziggy Stardust" comes on Andrew's stereo.
dialog: 73.
text: Andrew, wearing the jacket, looks at himself in the mirror,
text: his back to the camera. He reaches down, and picks something
text: up, looking at it, then pulls it over his head.
text: It's a gas mask.
text: He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless
text: figure in the mirror. Looks right. Looks left. Adjusts the
dialog: mask.
text: Then turns and whips out his hand; the camera is abruptly
text: yanked across the room.
scene_heading: EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - SUNSET
text: It's a run-down house in Andrew's neighborhood. The
text: streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in
text: yellow orange haze.
text: Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on the
text: porch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt. They clearly
text: haven't noticed Andrew, who's filming from out by the street.
text: He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at the
text: house. It flies up and breaks a window. Costly, Howard and
text: the thugs immediately mobilize, swearing and posturing as
text: they rapidly surround Andrew.
text: He doesn't react.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: You are about to get fucking
dialog: stomped, you know that right? You
dialog: hear me son? Come to my house,
dialog: it's late, I don't see any fucking
dialog: police officers or some shit, I
dialog: don't know what you you think
dialog: you're doing throwing shit at my
dialog: house-
speaker_heading: COSTLY
dialog: No, wait, what the fuck. What the
dialog: fuck are you dressed up like that
dialog: for. Are you high?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
text: Lil' Andrew's straight up tripping
dialog: right now, I don't even know, I'ma
dialog: give your ass a wake up call-
text: Howard starts towards Andrew, who raises a hand out in front
text: of the camera. He makes the "gun sign."
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: HOWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh you got a gat? I got a gat too
dialog: bitch-
text: Howard starts to pull a gun from the back of his pants.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: (firing the finger gun)
dialog: Bang.
text: Howard's body abruptly FOLDS BACKWARDS with a sickly loud
text: chorus of cracks, and then is FLUNG ASIDE. The thugs,
dialog: shocked, don't have a second to react before Andrew
text: telekinetically BLOWS ONE OF THEM BACKWARDS, sending him
text: smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car.
text: Costly and the remaining thug start running, and the
text: remaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him,
text: breaking, bending and twisting like a rag doll, before he's
text: propelled face first into the ground, WHAM.
text: Andrew launches into the air, coming down just in front of
text: Costly, who skids to a halt.
speaker_heading: COSTLY
dialog: -no, no-
text: Costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth as
text: though under the weight of a giant thumb, leaving a
text: glistening smear of clothes, blood and skin, before he falls
text: across the curb.
text: We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, but
text: other than that, the night is silent.
text: Andrew raises a hand, and all of their wallets and loose
text: money lift away from them, flying to him. There's a beat,
text: and then Andrew launches into the air.
scene_heading: EXT. RADIOTOWER - 80 FEET UP - TWILIGHT
text: Andrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights on
text: one of the strut supports. The camera sits nearby, watching
text: the expressionless figure as it counts the money.
text: There's a beat and he hangs his head. We can hear muffled
text: noises of frustration from under the mask. Something that
text: sounds like a low, angry scream.
text: Very suddenly, he dives off the tower. A second later, the
text: camera is yanked after him, zooming out into freefall.
dialog: 75.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION
text: Andrew, holding the camera, touches down just outside the gas
text: station. He waits a beat, and then starts to walk towards
dialog: it. We transition to...
text: FROM GAS STATION SECURITY CAMERAS.
text: Black and white, a slightly grainy feed, with no audio.
text: We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure
text: in the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in front
text: of it, strides past people pumping gas, into the station
dialog: store.
scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION
text: The wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store.
text: Andrew enters, turning to the clerk behind the register, who
text: says something, looking concerned. He's suddenly blown out
dialog: of frame.
text: After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter,
text: and floats over to Andrew.
text: Andrew turns and walks out, the register floating with him;
text: as he does, a second clerk rushes out, panicked, yelling. He
text: goes behind the counter, and grabs a shotgun.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION
text: Andrew exits the gas station, as does the clerk, who yells,
text: raising the shotgun.
text: Andrew whips an arm out towards him, and the clerk fires as
text: he's hit by a wave of energy. The shotgun blast goes wild,
text: striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage.
text: The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fire
text: envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we look
text: through jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down.
text: FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA.
text: The camera lays awkwardly on its side, the distorted audio
text: from its damaged microphone SUDDEN AND PIERCING.
text: It's been flung a good deal away from Andrew, who lays
text: motionless, burning.
dialog: 76.
text: The clerk is dead, and a nearby gas station customer is
text: horribly injured and screaming. His gas pump lays on the
text: ground, pumping out gas onto the asphalt.
text: Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forces
text: himself to roll over. The fire on his body touches the fire
text: on the asphalt, and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump.
text: The resulting explosion engulfs the entire station.
text: The camera is spun violently out into the street-
speaker_heading: VIOLENT
speaker_heading: DISTORTION AND
text: CRASH TO BLACK.
scene_heading: FROM SECURE ROOM VIDEO FEED
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
text: The camera is color, with crackly, strange, somewhat
text: distorted audio. The image is a little blown out.
text: Andrew on a bed. His entire right side is absolutely
text: scorched; the flesh looks like bloody, cracked paper,
text: blackened and red. The parts of him that are bandaged are
text: already soaked through with blood.
text: He is barely breathing, hooked up to various machines.
dialog: Andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon. This is ensured
text: by the handcuff on his left wrist.
text: The machines beep. Andrew doesn't move. The door opens, and
text: Mr. Detmer enters, speaking to a POLICE DETECTIVE on the
text: other side of the door.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
dialog: -come down to the city, cause his
dialog: mother's all alone right now.
dialog: She's got MS, I had to leave her at
dialog: the house all a fucking alone.
speaker_heading: POLICE DETECTIVE
dialog: I understand, Mr. Detmer.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
dialog: Shit. Jesus, look at this. Can I
dialog: have a moment with my son.
speaker_heading: POLICE DETECTIVE
dialog: Yeah I- I'll be outside the door,
dialog: yeah?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER
dialog: Okay.
text: The officer closes the door, and Mr. Detmer goes and sits
text: down in a chair next to the bed. He sits there staring at
text: Andrew, clearly horrified and upset, and buries his head in
text: his hands. We SPEED UP THE RECORDING, and Detmer just sits
text: like that. After five minutes of speed up, we slow down.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to apologize to me.
text: Andrew is comatose.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
dialog: I said I want you to apologize to
dialog: me. I know you can hear me. So I
dialog: want you to sit up and apologize to
dialog: me. I want you to stop this
dialog: bullshit right now.
text: Andrew is comatose.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know how much this shit is
dialog: going to cost me? Do you know what
dialog: you've done to your family?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You don't even care, do you? You
dialog: just don't give a fuck, you've got
dialog: your fucking morphine, don't you.
text: There's a beat, and then Detmer suddenly slaps Andrew's burnt
text: shoulder. Andrew flinches badly, and his pulse speeds up on
dialog: the monitor.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it. I'm not buying this shit,
dialog: you can't just play this off like a
dialog: fucking
dialog: (slap)
dialog: Game, this is real. You really
dialog: fucked me, me and your mother you
dialog: know that, you little
dialog: (slap)
dialog: Shit.
text: Andrew no longer flinches, but the slaps leave red, bleeding
text: molten welts. Detmer stands up, clearly upset, and takes a
text: quick pace forward and back.
speaker_heading: MR. DETMER (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamn it, goddamn it!-
dialog: 78.
text: Detmer goes to slap Andrew again, and Andrew's arm jerks up.
text: Mr. Detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air.
text: He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes
dialog: rigid.
text: Andrew spreads his fingers, and his father abruptly separates
text: into all of his component parts.
text: They stop moving, hanging lifeless, then drop to the ground
text: in a bloody mess.
text: Andrew's eyes open, revealing black-red eightball
text: hemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream of
text: agony, and then another, tearing at his IV.
text: The police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror to
text: the gore that was Andrew's father. They barely have time to
text: scream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, and
text: lets out AN ENORMOUS CONCUSSIVE BLAST, blowing apart
text: everything in the room including the camera.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: FROM CASEY'S CAMERA.
scene_heading: INT. CASEY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
text: All of Casey's family is present, along with lots of little
text: kids. Everyone's gathered around Casey's little brother,
text: who's being presented with a birthday cake. Matt looks
dialog: happy.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: -appy birthday to you!
text: Everyone let's out a cheer, including Casey, but then she
text: notices Matt abruptly duck out. She follows him to the
dialog: bathroom...
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: ...where he's holding his nose, which is bleeding badly.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Matt-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Do you hear that, how can you not

dialog: 79.
text: In the background, we can hear the house phone ring. Then
dialog: cell phones.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Matt, what hap-
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: The singing, how can you not hear
dialog: that!? Something's wrong, okay,

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Matt, please, okay, you're scaring

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No, something's wrong, something's

speaker_heading: CASEY'S MOM (O.S.)
dialog: Casey, you have to come in here.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Mom, Matt is-
speaker_heading: CASEY'S MOM

speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Casey's filming the big screen TV, which is showing the news.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: -going to have a feed live on the
dialog: scene in the second, we apologize
dialog: for the delay but as of right now
dialog: every news helicopter in the

dialog: the word is that the bombings
dialog: started just over nine minutes ago,
dialog: and haven't subsided yet, with-
dialog: okay, here's the feed from NBC
dialog: Chopper 5.
text: We get a helicopter view from over downtown Portland,
text: everything seems okay, and then something streaks by,
text: crashing headlong into the side of a building.
dialog: 80.
text: The impact is like a wrecking ball, office furniture blowing
text: out into the air along with glass, steel and concrete, WHAM.
speaker_heading: FIELD REPORTER (O.S.)
dialog: Wait, that was- that was not a bomb-
dialog: I repeat, not bombings, it's
dialog: something else-
text: The camera turns as Matt rushes down the stairs, now in his
text: winter parka, his nose plugged with kleenex. We hear another
text: of those jarring, shattering impacts, and the camera goes
text: back to the TV, revealing the big MADE IN OREGON sign in Old
text: Town toppling down into the street.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: I need your car.
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)
dialog: What? Matt, look, what's

scene_heading: EXT. CASEY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Casey is chasing Matt across the lawn to her car, her voice

dialog: unimportant.
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)
dialog: Please don't leave, don't go-
text: We hear helicopters pass low overhead.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I have to go to the city.
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)
scene_heading: NO MATT PLEASE, PLEASE-
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I can't fly if there are all these

dialog: to drive there, or, listen, I have
dialog: to figure this out, Andrew's in
dialog: trouble. This is my fault.
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)
dialog: Andrew? What are you talking ab-
text: Matt gets in the car and starts it. Casey's breaking down,
text: openly crying now.
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
scene_heading: Matt please! MATT PLEASE, PLEASE
dialog: DON'T GO, I'M AFRAID! MATT I'M
dialog: SCARED, PLEASE!
scene_heading: INT. CASEY'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Casey's sitting shotgun as Matt drives. His face is
text: unreadable. They're driving on the I-5. More helicopters.
text: Downtown Portland is visible now, as are some fires.
text: Casey is quietly crying, the camera held loosely in her lap.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: This is all my fault.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: No! No it isn't! It isn't your
dialog: fault!
text: We hear and see the lights of ambulances and police cars as

speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Matt, it's not safe. It's not
dialog: safe. What's going on. What's
dialog: happening. Why are we doing this,
dialog: Matt, please. Please take me home.
dialog: You don't have your license, you
dialog: can't drive without your license.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: They're getting into downtown now. We can hear sirens.
text: Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal,
text: until there's a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera to
text: reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed
text: on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: CASEY (CONT'D)
dialog: How- how is that possible, that's
dialog: not possible-
text: There's an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains
text: down onto the car. Matt slams on the brakes, looking up
text: through the windshield, searching the sky.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Where are you, man?
text: There's a beat, and then a police officer abruptly appears on
text: the passenger's side, next to Casey.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Listen, you can't be here, I need
dialog: you to turn this car around right
dialog: now and-
text: The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight

text: Casey screams.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: What's...What is...What's...Matt
dialog: please, please-
text: The car SUDDENLY ROCKETS INTO THE AIR, straight up, flipping
text: end over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comes
text: to a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet. Casey's
text: breathing is painfully short and sharp. Matt stares out into
text: the night sky.
text: He flicks on the brights. There's Andrew, in his hospital
text: gown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and
text: twisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain.
text: A news helicopter circles past out of sight, and for a
text: moment, Andrew is framed in the chopper's spotlight.
text: His eyes flash to the car.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?
text: The windshield is TORN OUT, and seconds later MATT IS RIPPED
text: OUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK, taking his
text: seatbelt with him.
speaker_heading: CASEY
speaker_heading: No NO NO
dialog: 83.
text: The car goes into freefall, no longer important to Andrew,
text: plummeting down, down, down. Casey's screams are barely
text: audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush
text: past outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to
dialog: her death.
text: And then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting,
text: the side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurred
text: views of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans...
text: Stillness. Casey's camera is pointed down, showing her
text: adidas...and Matt's high-tops.
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Stay here, okay? You have to stay
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)
dialog: (barely coherent)
dialog: You can fly?
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Stay here. I have to talk to
dialog: Andrew.
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)
dialog: Matt..what...
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: Casey, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
text: Matt's feet suddenly go out of frame.
speaker_heading: CASEY (O.S.)
dialog: Matt wait! WAIT PLEASE! MATT!
text: NOTE: In the following sequence, everything is seen in
text: glimpses and glances, never lingering too long on one thing.
dialog: Much of what happens should be seen through implication,
dialog: rather than direct effect.
text: Everything happens very fast, and none of the cameras can
dialog: fully keep track.
scene_heading: FROM SEVERAL HELICAMS.
text: The feed is crisp and clear, but without the satellite audio,
text: meaning no narration from the reporter. There are several
text: chopper's flying at different distances from the action, and
dialog: we intercut as necessary.
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN PORTLAND
text: The news chopper at first shows Casey's destroyed car laying
text: in the street, then pans back up to show Andrew, who's
text: floating hunched over, vomiting.
text: Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andrew
text: shoves him away. We're too far away to hear anything that's
dialog: said.
text: Matt tries again, and Andrew yells something. Matt, clearly
text: upset, replies. Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures
text: towards his burns. Matt tries to reply several times, but
text: Andrew isn't hearing it. Matt smiles nervously at the
text: destruction, and says something gently.
text: Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a
text: radical shift in Matt's demeanor. He's no longer concerned;
text: he seems repulsed. Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING at
dialog: Matt.
text: Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents.
text: Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices something
text: to his right. A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR, SWATTING HIM
text: LIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.
text: Andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopper;
text: a mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA.
scene_heading: FROM MICHAEL ERNESTO'S CAMERA.
text: MICHAEL ERNESTO is, along with several other people from his
text: building, out on his roof. He watches in horror as the
text: helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of
dialog: frame.
text: Moments later, we hear the explosion as it crashes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, oh no, those people, man, those
dialog: people, oh god-
speaker_heading: ERNESTO'S NEIGHBOR (O.S.)
dialog: Where's the other guy?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
dialog: He's fucking dead man, you saw- oh
dialog: shit oh shit-
text: Andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded
text: bird, crashing into the roof. He vomits again, mostly bile;
text: everyone around him is in shock, frozen, as he screams in
text: pain and rolls over.
dialog: 85.
text: He's bleeding badly from the nose and ears.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (agonized, crying)
dialog: No one's gonna help me...No one's
dialog: gonna help me now...
text: We get some shots from other people's cameras, video phones,
text: etc on the roof. Some people scream and try to run past
text: Andrew, and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins,
text: which leads to more screaming.
text: Andrew stands shakily, looking directly at Michael Ernesto.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
dialog: Please man, please, I don't know
dialog: you man-
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (mumbled)
dialog: What type of camera is that?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL ERNESTO (O.S.)
dialog: (breaking down)
dialog: What? I don't know, I don't know
dialog: you man, I didn't- please okay,
dialog: please-
text: Andrew starts to raise an arm, when he's suddenly NAILED BY
text: MATT, blasting by at well over eighty miles an hour.
text: FROM BANK SECURITY CAMERA.
text: The inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful, when MATT AND
text: ANDREW COME CRASHING THROUGH THE ROOF.
scene_heading: FROM POLICE CAR DASHBOARD CAM.
text: The police car rockets up the street, but has to screech to a
text: halt when MATT AND ANDREW COME EXPLODING OUT OF THE FRONT OF
text: THE BANK.
text: The two of them brawl in the street for a moment; it's not
dialog: impressive martial arts, or even super powered, just two guys
text: fighting for their lives. Matt gets the upperhand, decking
text: Andrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the cop
text: car (our POV), lifts off.
text: WE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he turns
text: and creates a telekinetic wall.
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: FROM CALA PRENTI'S CAMERA.
text: CALA, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock and
text: horror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sent
text: FLIPPING INTO THE AIR, and we glimpse it as it passes her
text: window, lights still flaring.
text: Her sister rushes up, looking out the window.
speaker_heading: CALA (O.S.)
dialog: Sissy stay away from the window!
speaker_heading: SISSY
dialog: What's happening what's happening-
speaker_heading: CALA (O.S.)

dialog: They're-
text: Andrew and Matt come BLASTING UP THROUGH THE FLOOR IN THE
text: KITCHEN OFF TO THE RIGHT, AND THEN OUT THROUGH THE CEILING.
scene_heading: FROM KPR-PORTLAND'S HELICAM.
text: The two boys come smashing up through the roof of the
text: apartment building. Andrew flies low, and Matt gives chase.
text: Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at
text: street level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees,
dialog: etc...
dialog: ...But Matt's too good a flyer. What he doesn't block he
text: simply dips and weaves around. Andrew, clearly still woozy,
text: is distracted and smashes into a street-light, wiping out on
dialog: the asphalt.
speaker_heading: CAMERA-MAN
dialog: They're down. One of them just
dialog: went down. Jesus christ.
text: Matt slowly lands nearby. The camera zooms in and hits them
text: both with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes and
text: look up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand.
text: We get a good look at the toll this is taking on him; Matt's
text: face is a crimson mask of blood from his nose, eyes, mouth
text: and ears. He's limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly
text: covered with injuries. He looks like he's been in a car
dialog: wreck.
speaker_heading: CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit, look at him.
dialog: 87.
text: He approaches Andrew, talking again, more fervently. Andrew
text: just shakes his head, falling repeatedly as he tries to
text: stand, like a wounded dog.
text: Two cop cars skid to a halt nearby, the officers unloading
text: and taking cover. One of them advances on Matt and Andrew,
text: gun raised. Matt goes out in front of Andrew, protective,
text: pleading, raising his hands.
text: The cop is clearly panicked. He fires a shot. Matt's arm
text: whips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain,
text: holding his hand, which is gushing blood.
text: Andrew blasts the
text: Matt falls, screaming, and Andrew stands.
dialog: officers backwards.
speaker_heading: CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: OH SHIT! Oh jesus christ!

text: following a second later, tackling Matt out of the air.
scene_heading: FROM KPR-PORTLAND'S LIVE-ON-THE-SCENE.
text: We're at street level in downtown, people are absolutely

speaker_heading: FIELD REPORTER
dialog: Are we...Okay, yeah, gimme- two,
dialog: one- We're live on the scene on
text: Parson Boulevard just south of the
dialog: center of downtown, and-

speaker_heading: FIELD REPORTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Shawn, wait, you're unplugged.
dialog: Shawn-
text: Something around the corner explodes, and Matt comes flying
text: past overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lunging
text: at Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man,
text: SLAMMING HIM INTO THE SIDE OF A SKYSCRAPER ON THE STREET.
text: Andrew lifts Matt up high into the air, scraping him against

dialog: pinball until-
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: FROM ABC 5'S HELICAM.
text: -Matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; a

text: downwards as though shot out of a cannon.
text: They strike the massive bronze statue of "Portlandia," a
text: trident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Graves
text: building, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to
dialog: the ground.
text: Matt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops
text: down at a broken, dead angle. Andrew lands nearly as badly,
text: lays still for a moment, and then begins twitching and
text: screaming when the chopper's spotlight hits him.
text: FROM MICHAEL GRAVES' BUILDING EXTERIOR SECURITY CAMERA
text: The statue of Portlandia lays awkwardly in the street.
text: Andrew writhes. Matt is motionless, blood pooling around
text: him, his back broken.
scene_heading: FROM POLICE DASHBOARD CAMS, HELICOPTER CAMERAS, HANDHELDS
text: FROM WINDOWS, EVERYTHING.
text: A bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the
text: front of the Michael Graves building and downed statue. Matt
text: and Andrew's bodies are painted by spotlights as police and
text: news helicopters hang overhead.
text: Police unload en-mass, guns out, immediately forming a
text: perimeter and pushing in. We're with them as they approach;
text: the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting
text: back and forth to each other.
text: Andrew and Matt are polka-dotted by red-laser sight dots.
text: Andrew suddenly stands up, and several officers fire; the
text: bullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him, and
text: he shakily raises both hands.
text: The all of the police officers, firemen and paramedics are
text: telekinetically lifted into the air.
text: They hang struggling for a moment, and then all of their
text: limbs go rigid. We've seen this before.
text: Andrew screams, and then...It all happens in under two
dialog: seconds:
dialog: 89.
text: Matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of
text: Portlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard,
text: first through Andrew, then into the pavement.
text: Andrew stands impaled, a look of shock on his face, and then
text: Matt flails up his hand; the bullet lodged inside fires out,
text: striking Andrew in the head, killing him instantly.
text: All of the floating people drop, dazed.
text: Matt collapses. After a moment, the police advance.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
scene_heading: FROM CLEAN ROOM CAMS.
text: The clean room cams are incredibly hi-def, crisp and clear,
text: with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the
text: top and bottom of the screens.
text: Matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room. At the far
text: end is a blackened out two way mirror. There's a camera on
text: the inside of this too, and we can see resolute men in suits
text: reflected on the inner glass, watching with unreadable
dialog: expressions.
text: There is a chair and a table, but he's clearly fallen out of
text: the chair. It's maybe an hour after the scene in front of
dialog: the Michael Graves building, and he's received no medical
dialog: attention.
text: To this end, Matt is suffering from, among other things,
text: massive blood-loss, multiple broken bones, dozens of gashes
text: and cuts, presumed internal bleeding, and a broken back.
text: He can barely move, sliding around on the floor in his own
text: blood as he dies, watched by the compassionless eyes of the
dialog: cameras.
text: He is barely coherent, screeching in agony.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Please...Help me. Help me, HELP ME,
dialog: please...I'm sorry! I'm so sorry,
dialog: I tried- help me, help me, I'm
dialog: dying, I'm dying. Stars- I see
dialog: stars, somebody- It hurts, please.
dialog: I'm- the blood...I tried...
text: Two men in contamination suits enter the room, wielding some
text: kind of radiation sensors. They go over to Matt, scanning
dialog: him.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, help me, help me. I'm
dialog: dying, you have to help me, don't
dialog: just let me- PLEASE I'M SORRY! I'm
dialog: SORRY! HELP ME! I-
text: The men ignore him as Matt makes some gasping sounds, his
text: eyes going wide.
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: I can...I can hear the singing.
text: Matt entirely stops moving. He lays there, not breathing,
text: completely still.
text: And then suddenly the two men are flung backwards, as is the
text: table and the chair. There are a series of grotesque popping
text: and snapping sounds from Matt's body, and he jerks, and
text: writhes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees.
text: The security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, we
text: realize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves.
text: His broken bones have already molded back into place. His
text: bruises are shrinking away to nothing.
text: The blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its
text: frame, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking
text: military personnel, along with several men in civilian
dialog: clothes.
text: Matt stares at them. They stare back at him.
scene_heading: 4-STAR GENERAL
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: Listen...Son, you don't- I mean...
text: Matt raises a finger to his lips, and the general trails off.
text: Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Would you please...turn off the
dialog: fucking cameras.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: HOLD ON BLACK
scene_heading: FOR A MOMENT.

scene_heading: FROM INTERNATIONAL NEWS BROADCASTS.
text: We see a variety of international reporters covering a
text: breaking story, but only see little clips of each, in
text: multiple languages. Behind them are various shots of a huge
dialog: hydroelectric dam in South Korea.
speaker_heading: REPORTERS
dialog: -expected to burst at any moment-
dialog: City officials blame the
dialog: malfunctions on the terrorist
dialog: bombing that occurred at the dam's
dialog: control center last March.-
dialog: Botched evacuation has left
dialog: thousands of the Kyo-lee Valley's
dialog: residents trapped, with only one
text: major roadway leading in or out. A
dialog: roadway that has not been repaired
dialog: in over ten years- Again, the scale
dialog: here is just unprecedented. Our
dialog: hearts are with people of Kyo-Lee
dialog: tonight.
scene_heading: FROM KIM HAI-SU'S CAMERA.
scene_heading: INT. KIM HAI-SU'S HOUSE
text: Kim Hai-Su, 17, is behind the camera filming his father, 40s,
text: as his father hurries to gather his things into a duffle.
text: Kim Hai-Su's younger brother, 8, wanders into the room,
text: crying loudly, and Kim's father screams at him to put down
dialog: the camera.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: They're in the car, driving fast through town. All around we
text: can see people panicking, and we see two cars collide on the
text: road up ahead.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: They pull up onto an on-ramp, and are immediately trapped
text: into gridlocked, dead-end traffic. Kim Hai-Su's father
text: begins shrieking, and banging on the dashboard, which
text: triggers his younger brother crying again. Kim shouts to
dialog: calm down.
speaker_heading: CUT.
text: Kim is climbing out of the car; people all around are getting
text: out of their cars, hopelessly trapped. Someone screams, and
text: Kim turns to reveal an enormous dam several miles away.
dialog: 92.
text: Rubble is falling off the side of an gigantic crack, which
text: splits further. Kim yells in fear. The crack widens, an
text: enormous tidal gush of water bursts through, gushing down the
text: side of the hills into the valley.
text: Kim's father embraces him, and they have a brief exchange,
text: when suddenly there's the sound of a sonic boom overhead.
text: All around them people EXPLODE into cheers. It's not fear,
text: but rather a kind of frantic ovation. The camera sweeps up,
text: panning the empty blue sky excitedly, finally coming to rest
dialog: on
dialog: Matt Garrety.
text: Looking fucking great as he floats above the freeway. He
text: pantomimes "yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!" This gets the
text: intended response, and he pumps a fist shouting "FUCK YEAH
dialog: KOREA!"
text: He turns, pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the
text: first time, mouths "Oh shit!" Points at the flood casually
text: as it closes in: "I should deal with this." Another huge
text: ovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head "yeahhhhhh!"
dialog: and turns.
text: There's a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach 4 in less
text: than a second, rattling the cars on the freeway, disappearing
text: into the distance over the flood.
text: After a moment, the impossibly huge onrush of water seems to
text: stop, slowing and freezing in place, and then...SLOWLY BEGINS
text: TO REWIND TOWARDS THE DAM.
text: The camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane,
text: embracing, kissing, screaming, jumping on their cars. Kim's
text: father has collapsed into tears of joy next to the car, and
text: Kim himself is hooting and hollering from the bottom of his
dialog: lungs.
text: The camera comes up to show his little brother, who is going
text: positively ape-shit on the hood of their car, jumping up and
text: down, screaming, smiling...
text: An unearthly, angelic, vibrating chorus of voices starts to
dialog: rise, rise, singing and we-
dialog: SLAM TO TITLE ON
