dialog: by Richard Taylor
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
speaker_heading: THE EARTH
text: spins in mortal turmoil. A vast spinner of clouds the size of
text: Australia approaches the west coast of North America,
text: lightning flashing, thunder BELLOWING and CRACKLING. The sky
text: glows red and purple, angry and crazy. This is the planet
dialog: made Gothic by human intervention.
scene_heading: SEATTLE - THE SPACE NEEDLE
text: is buffeted by hundred-and-fifty-mile-an-hour winds. Plate
text: glass shatters and explodes.
scene_heading: SAN FRANCISCO - THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
text: quakes before the raging wind. A giant tsunami surges toward
text: the great suspension bridge. When it passes, cables have been
text: wrenched, untwining, and collapse appears imminent.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
text: The city is a swamp, some buildings on dry ground, others
text: below sea level. Far south and east of its northern cousins,
text: the full thrust of the storm has not struck Los Angeles yet.
text: Smoke from open fires trail skyward like ghosts and spread
text: along the ceiling of the sky even as it bleeds rain
dialog: everywhere.
scene_heading: A TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL (MANDY)
text: runs, terrified, down a decayed city street. She clutches
text: something in her dirt-caked hands, holds it dear to her
dialog: breast.
text: The girl slides around a corner on her bottom, stares back.
scene_heading: GIRL'S POV - THE STREET
text: seems derelict. A flash of lightning reveals men scurrying
text: like rats after her.
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 2.
scene_heading: RESUME AND FOLLOW MANDY (A MONTAGE)
text: as she turns and scrambles away. Her pursuers follow her
text: everywhere â€” around rusting cars, through an abandoned MTA
text: bus, and across the rubble of a building that once dispensed
dialog: happy meals and toys.
text: Mandy dives into a burrow beneath piled debris.
text: One of the men walks directly toward her.
text: Another scurries, chortling madly, around to her side.
text: A third man approaches from behind.
text: Mandy clutches her prize ever-more tightly and prays that
text: they don't see her.
dialog: They do.
text: The leader lifts Mandy from the debris, her naked legs
text: dangling from beneath her torn dress.
speaker_heading: LEAD RAT
dialog: Lookit what I got!
text: Mandy struggles and screams. Lead Rat covers her mouth.
text: Limping Rat snatches the prize from her fingers: A dinner
text: roll, hard as a rock and twice as filthy.
speaker_heading: LIMPING RAT
dialog: So that's what you're hiding, little
dialog: girl? Don't you want to share? You want
dialog: to share, right?
text: Mandy writhes free enough to say:
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Take it! Take it! Just... leave me alone!
text: Chortling Rat arrives. His fingers pinch Mandy's leg.
speaker_heading: CHORTLING RAT
dialog: This little girl's plump.
text: Lead Rat drops her to the ground, assesses her.
speaker_heading: LEAD RAT
dialog: You got family, girl... with anything to
dialog: trade?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Mandy understands immediately.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Yes! Yes, my daddy's got canned goods.
dialog: And gasoline.
text: Lead Rat thinks about this. The dinner roll lying abandoned
text: nearby suggests not.
speaker_heading: CHORTLING RAT
dialog: She'd feed us for a week!
speaker_heading: LIMPING RAT
dialog: (grinning, of Chortling Rat as
dialog: he assesses girl)
dialog: I dunno... You still on that diet?
text: Mandy screams and tries to break away. Lead Rat holds her in
text: a vise grip.
text: Chortling Rat kneels beside the little girl.
speaker_heading: CHORTLING RAT
dialog: (of leader)
dialog: I never took you for squeamish.
text: That settles it. Lead Rat produces a huge switchblade. It
text: snaps out, steel catching the light.
text: Mandy screams.
text: An arrow slams through Lead Rat's neck. He doesn't move, not
dialog: believing.
scene_heading: JOHN GARTH (35) STANDS ON A WALL (SCENE),
text: a hard man with hawk eyes now focused on killing. Even though
text: he is a warrior, there is something humane about John Garth.
text: He knows there is no glory to what he is doing. His rock-like
text: exposed arms hold the bow's tension like the cables of a
text: suspension bridge, and shake with the load. He releases.
text: Lead Rat faces death and drops.
text: Limping Rat is already scurrying away, weapon drawn, when
text: Garth's second arrow catches him. He drops.
text: Chortling Rat, whining fearfully, scuttles around debris,
text: hiding his silhouette. He pulls a nasty looking automatic and
text: looks up to find a target when an arrow slams into him. He
dialog: falls.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Garth drops to the ground, walks to Mandy, who stands sucking
text: air like the price is going up.
speaker_heading: JOHN GARTH
dialog: Your mother's worried.
text: Mandy shakes her head crazily. Yes, I know.
text: Garth kneels beside her. Mandy bursts into his arms. He holds
text: her like a father until her sobs diminish.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: You shouldn't go out by yourself.
text: Mandy buries her head in his chest, safe now.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: But I'm hungry, John.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: I know...
text: Garth releases her and steps past to harvest the arrow that
text: took Lead Rat's life. He takes the switchblade as well.
text: Mandy scurries to where the dinner roll lies and retrieves
text: it. She tries to bite into it. Hard as stone.
scene_heading: BESIDE LIMPING RAT'S CORPSE - GARTH
text: harvests the second arrow, using the switchblade to cut the
text: arrow out.
text: Mandy staggers to Garth's side. She looks yearningly at
text: Limping Rat. Clutching Garth's leg:
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: It would be a waste to just leave them
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: (understanding her meaning)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: But I'm hungry.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: You stay here. I have to get my other
dialog: arrow.
text: Garth moves to get the arrow.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Mandy waits nervously near Limping Rat's corpse. When Garth
text: returns, he scoops her up and starts walking away.
text: Looking back from Garth's arms, Mandy's hungry eyes remain on
text: the corpse.
scene_heading: EXT. SURVIVOR'S CAMP - NIGHT
text: It's a hovel bandaged with debris. Campfires burn with
text: constant complaint, sizzling embers and hissing wood once
text: shaped by hand. Mist clouds everything.
text: Men and women guard the ramparts, some with guns, some with
text: bows like Garth's.
speaker_heading: A GUARD
dialog: Someone's coming.
text: The men scramble to the walls.
speaker_heading: GARTH'S VOICE
dialog: (a shout)
dialog: John Garth!
text: A moment later Garth enters the camp with Mandy carried on
dialog: his hip.
text: Mandy's mother rushes to take her into her arms as Garth
text: drops her.
speaker_heading: MANDY'S MOM
dialog: Mandy!
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Look, Mom... I found some bread.
speaker_heading: MANDY'S MOM
dialog: Where were you?! I've been worried to
dialog: death!
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: She's okay. I found her about six blocks
text: south, near Pico.
speaker_heading: MANDY'S MOM
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: It's okay.

dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: (showing her prize)
dialog: Mom! Look, bread!
speaker_heading: MANDY'S MOM
dialog: You put that away, now. One of the
dialog: hunters found meat. We have stew.
dialog: Garth turns at this information. Meat?
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Food?! Mommy, I'm so hungry...
speaker_heading: MANDY'S MOM
dialog: Come on, sweetheart. I'll get you a bowl.
text: Garth questions this silently, then turns to head for his
dialog: digs.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. GARTH'S DIGS - NIGHT
text: An often-repaired tent. Garth throws the entry flap back,
text: enters to find his father, MATTHEW, Garth grown older and
text: weaker. He lies in a hammock, recovering from a broken leg.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: You're not dead, I see.
dialog: Storing his equipment:
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Not yet. How's the leg?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: I'm hobbling about. Anything happen out
dialog: there?
text: Garth turns to survey his father, pulls three cans of
text: Campbell's soup from his jacket.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: I killed six men... three this morning
dialog: over these...
dialog: (presents the cans)
dialog: ... three tonight over the Parker girl.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: You found her alive?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Alive. She wouldn't have stayed that way
dialog: long... I hear they've got stew. Did
dialog: anybody bring you some?
text: Matthew snorts.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
text: Rodriguez says he killed a deer. Brought
dialog: the meat in already butchered... There
dialog: are no deer left in Los Angeles, not even
text: in the canyons.
text: Garth understands. Meat. Of the human variety. After a
dialog: moment:
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: How 'bout some Campbell's soup? M'M-M'M-
dialog: Good...
dialog: (reads labels)
dialog: Cream of mushroom... chicken noodle...
dialog: and cream of tomato.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: (smacking his lips)
dialog: Chicken noodle. I'll stoke the fire.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: No, dad. I'll take care of it. You stay
dialog: off that leg.
text: Garth pulls his survival knife and begins to open one of the
dialog: cans.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: INT. GARTH'S DIGS - NIGHT
text: Garth and Matthew lie asleep after their repast, Matthew in
text: his hammock, Garth on a bed made of old clothes.
scene_heading: EXT. SURVIVOR'S CAMP - NIGHT
text: Guards walk lonely beats behind walls of debris.
text: Suddenly a brilliant light appears in the night sky. A VOICE
text: from a loudspeaker:
speaker_heading: HELICOPTER VOICE
dialog: You people in the camp... We're looking
dialog: for John Garth.
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 8.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - HELICOPTER
text: hovers a hundred yards from the ramparts, its single
text: directional light bouncing from point to point on the walls.
speaker_heading: HELICOPTER VOICE
dialog: Is he in there?
scene_heading: EXT. CAMP
text: Garth exits his digs. His father hobbles after.
text: A camp citizen climbs to the top of the walls.
speaker_heading: CAMP CITIZEN
dialog: He's here... What do you want?
speaker_heading: HELICOPTER VOICE
dialog: We're coming in.
text: The chopper sets down.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER - THREE MEN
text: enter the camp. Two wear LAPD uniforms, the third a long coat
text: with a detective badge pinned to a lapel, LAPIERE. He's the
text: sort of man who becomes a cop because of one perk â€” power.
text: One of the uniforms carries a cardboard box marked Peaches.
text: The camp citizens give them a wide berth. Garth stands one
dialog: row back.
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: I'm Detective Lieutenant Oscar LaPiere of
dialog: the LAPD.
speaker_heading: THE CROWD
dialog: --. he's no cop... no police anymore...
dialog: he's lying (etc.)
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: Of course there are police left.
dialog: (smiling confidently)
dialog: We're just like you, trying to survive.
dialog: We help when we can.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: You must be pretty busy... elsewhere.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 9.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Lapiere's steady grin belies the heat of his eyes directed at
dialog: Garth.
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: Where's John Garth?
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: What do you want with him?
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: I've brought him a gift. Are you John
dialog: Garth?
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: What gift? Who sent it?
text: LaPiere allows the question to dangle a moment, then steps
text: aside and gestures to the cop holding the crate to set it
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: Peaches... Name brand, not the store
dialog: variety... packed in syrup.
text: The gasp of camp citizens suggests this might be gold.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Who sent it?
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: Anton Reich.
text: Garth kneels beside the cardboard box to check the glue
text: seals. Not tampered with.
speaker_heading: LAPIERE (CONT'D)
dialog: I take it you're John Garth?
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Who's Anton Reich? And what does he want
dialog: with me?
text: Mandy steps through the crowd and kneels beside the box. She
text: is in awe of it.
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: He wants to hire you. He instructed me to
dialog: tell you â€” this is a signing bonus.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Signing bonus? Then it's not a gift?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: Oh no. It's yours. No strings.
text: Garth considers that, then tears the box open and hands Mandy
text: a can. She can't suppress her joy. Running to her mother:
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Mommy! Mommy! Look what I got!
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: (continuing with restrained
dialog: disapproval)
dialog: You can do with it what you will, of
dialog: course... Mr. Reich just wants to take a
dialog: meeting with you.
text: Garth removes four cans from the box and gives them to his
text: father. Taking one can for himself, Garth shoves what remains
text: of the box into the arms of the camp leader.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Share this...
dialog: (to LaPiere)
dialog: Let's go.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAMP - NIGHT
text: The helicopter looks shiny new as Garth, LaPiere and the cops
text: trudge through debris-ridden terrain. Garth uses his survival
text: knife to open the can of peaches.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: (of chopper)
dialog: I didn't think there were any of those
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: You'd be surprised what's left... if you
dialog: know the right people.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. THE HELICOPTER - NIGHT
text: The chopper flies through the rainy night.
text: Garth pushes the can lid back and drinks thirstily before
text: lifting a peach slice out and swallowing it whole, like a
text: bear with a fish just caught from a stream. LaPiere looks on
text: with amusement. Garth sees his look, offers the can.
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: No thank you. I've eaten.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Garth shrugs, digs out another fish.
scene_heading: EXT. UCLA MEDICAL CENTER LANDING PAD - NIGHT
text: The lights work, even if the sign has been damaged: UCL(A)
text: M(ed) ICAL CEN(t)ER. The chopper sets down.
text: Garth, Lapiere and the attending cops exit and make for the
text: big hospital building as Garth tosses the empty can of
text: peaches into an empty wire receptacle.
scene_heading: INT. UCLA MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT
text: Garth, LaPiere and the uniformed cops make their way into the
text: building, which obviously is no longer in use as a hospital.
text: Even though it appears abandoned, the lights work.
text: Garth stops to look around. He hasn't seen electric lights in
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: What's powering these lights?
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: (moving him along)
text: Mr. Reich has his residence on the top
dialog: floor.
scene_heading: INT. UCLA MEDICAL CENTER TOP FLOOR - NIGHT
text: An immense open bay. At one end are stacked platform after
text: platform of canned goods, ammunition, oil, military weaponry
text: in cases, liquor, medical supplies. At the opposite end, a
text: mansion in miniature with unblemished furniture, Persian
text: carpets, drapes over the windows, stands of famous artworks,
text: paintings, sculpture, and a huge oak desk stolen, certainly,
text: from a rich man's office.
text: Men in uniform stand guard beside the elevator door, one
text: LAPD, the second MTA. One uniform is as good as another,
dialog: apparently
text: The elevator opens. Garth and LaPiere exit, followed by the
dialog: two cops.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - ANTON REICH
text: is a man of formidable countenance. 50, he wears clothes that
dialog: in better times might be considered obscenely expensive. He
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: is a leader, a manipulator, and a salesman. He approaches
text: Garth as if welcoming an important client, extending a hand.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Major Garth, welcome. Anton Reich.
text: Garth surveys him briefly, the proffered hand, then turns his
text: gaze to the cops.
speaker_heading: REICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry. They're not really police.
dialog: They work for me now.
text: Garth's gaze continues to the flats of canned goods and other
dialog: supplies.
speaker_heading: REICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you hungry, Major?
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Oh no, I just finished dinner. Steak and
dialog: lobster, a good chardonnay, and chocolate
dialog: mousse for dessert.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Better than my table, I'm afraid. But I
dialog: can have my cook whip up something...
dialog: Major?
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: I'm not a major.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: No, of course not. Not anymore. Who of us
dialog: have titles these days?... Sergeant?
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: It's Lieutenant, Mr. Reich.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Mr. Garth and I will have dinner in the
dialog: residence. See to it.
speaker_heading: LAPIERE
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Lapiere turns and moves for the elevator.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: (to cops)
dialog: You two may leave as well.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Reich takes Garth by the arm, and releases him on Garth's
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: REICH (CONT'D)
dialog: While we're waiting for dinner, can I get
dialog: you anything else?
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Well, Adolph... you can tell me what you
dialog: want so I can blow this bunker.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Adolph... not such a bad fellow after
dialog: all, now was he?... I should think simple
dialog: logic would answer your question. You
dialog: have nothing I could want â€” except skill.
dialog: Obviously, I want to hire you.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: I'm not for hire.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Yes, I'm certain that's so. Do you see
dialog: that flat of canned goods back there?
text: Garth looks. A mountain eight feet by eight feet. A fortune.
speaker_heading: REICH (CONT'D)
dialog: I had it brought up here just so you
dialog: could see it. I usually leave food down
dialog: in the pantry... In any case, there are
dialog: sixty cases of beef stew, sixty of fruit
dialog: cocktail, sixty cases of peaches â€” my
dialog: favorite, I usually have peaches for
dialog: dessert â€” sixty cases of deviled ham,
dialog: sixty cases of hash, sixty cases of tuna,
dialog: sixty cases of... well, I can give you a
dialog: manifest.
text: Garth takes in the vast fortune. He fails to hide his
dialog: astonishment.
speaker_heading: REICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you still not for hire, Major Garth?
text: Garth's silence is answer enough.
speaker_heading: REICH (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought so...
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Who do you want me to kill?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Kill? Kill?! Killing is easy, Major. What
dialog: I want you to do is much harder. Care for
dialog: a brandy?
text: Reich opens a fresh bottle of Courvoisier, almost fills two
text: snifters, turns to hand one to Garth.
speaker_heading: GARTH
text: stands before one of a dozen paintings, many recognizable,
text: but not this. It's a map of the earth with a vast storm, not
text: unlike the Red Spot of Jupiter, swirling across the world.
text: Reich presents Garth with a brandy.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: You've found my Nilsson. It's
dialog: magnificent, isn't it?
text: Garth takes the brandy, sniffs, and is snatched into
text: enthralled memories.
speaker_heading: REICH (CONT'D)
dialog: It's called 'The Blue Spot.' It was
dialog: painted right after they discovered the
text: storm that circles the surface of the
dialog: earth, like 'The Red Spot' circles
text: Jupiter, returning again and again,
text: wreaking havoc... Nilsson killed himself
dialog: right after he completed it.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Suicide doesn't exactly distinguish him,
dialog: does it?
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: No, not at all. So many people have
dialog: killed themselves. Still, it's a
dialog: magnificent piece. Most of these pieces
dialog: you see here I took into protective
dialog: custody from the Getty.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: I thought I recognized some of them.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Which is why I need you, Major.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: I told you. I'm not a major anymore.
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 15.
speaker_heading: REICH
text: yanks a tarp from a table miniature of an estate.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Come see this.
text: Garth reluctantly joins him.
speaker_heading: REICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you recognize it?
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: The Vincent estate.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Yes. It's located across the four-oh-five
text: from the Getty, in the Sepulveda Pass.
dialog: It's nearly as big, too. Are you familiar
dialog: with Vincent?
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Just that he's rich.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Was rich. No one's seen him in years.
dialog: He's probably dead. Still, his estate
dialog: remains operative... You may have
dialog: wondered how it is that we have electric
dialog: lights here, elevators that work and so
dialog: on, when the rest of the city has been
dialog: reduced to the stone age. It's because
text: UCLA has a nuke in the basement. It was
dialog: installed for educational purposes, but
dialog: it's large enough to supply the entire
dialog: facility with power...
text: Reich searches Garth's eyes for understanding. Finally:
speaker_heading: REICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Vincent installed a duplicate in his
text: estate. It's fully automated, powering a
text: specially designed security system.
dialog: Vincent intended to convert his estate
text: into a museum on his death, but the world
dialog: fell apart first. I want you to break in,
dialog: Major... break in and shut down Vincent's
dialog: nuke, so I can take all of Vincent's art
dialog: into protective custody.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 16.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: (cynical grin)
dialog: Protective custody?
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Oh hell, I could call it stealing, but
dialog: the truth is, it'll only be in my hands
dialog: until I die, and then the next fellow
dialog: will come along and protect it.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: You could say the same thing about
dialog: gold...
text: (eyes drifting toward the
dialog: palets of food)
text: -.. while other valuables are consumable.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Yes, that's true... So, what do you say?
text: The shadows across Garth's eyes hide deep thoughts.
scene_heading: LATER - GARTH AND REICH SIT AT TABLE
text: enjoying a sumptuous meal. Candlesticks, wine, dishes filled
text: with ample portions.
text: Nearby, the table miniature.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: -.. thing is, the roof is protected by
dialog: surface-to-air missiles, SAMs. Anything
dialog: that comes within a thousand yards of the
text: place is blown up.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: You tried it?
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Hm, yes.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Why not assault it from the side?
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: The grounds are protected by miniature
dialog: battle units â€” tanks, in reality,
dialog: although they were manufactured to look
dialog: like dogs.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: With just the equipment you have over
dialog: there...
dialog: (gestures crates across room)
dialog: ++. you could take out something like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: REICH
text: The entrances are made of six inch armor
dialog: plate, but we could get past that, too.
dialog: It was proven during the middle ages that
dialog: any wall may be breached. No, the problem
dialog: is, I don't want any of Vincent's
dialog: collection damaged.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Go in a window, then.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: You make it sound so easy. I hope that it
dialog: is. A window, yes. The real problem is
dialog: not getting in, but staying alive once
dialog: you're there...
dialog: (on Garth's look)
dialog: I have much of Vincent's security plans.
dialog: Some, anyway. He employed a new kind of
text: controller, a sentient computer system.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: The computer reasons? Like a human being?
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Here. Let me show you.
text: Reich removes a notebook computer from a briefcase beside the
text: table, opens it. A picture of DIANA LOGAN, 28, appears on the
text: screen. Diana is beautiful, yes, but behind her eyes resides
text: an incisive mind and a depth of feeling unusual in one so
dialog: young.
speaker_heading: REICH (CONT'D)
dialog: Twenty years ago this woman, Diana Logan,
dialog: was dying of cancer. Vincent convinced
dialog: her to transfer her consciousness into
text: his one-of-a-kind mainframe, which he
dialog: named EnCrypt. She lives there still,
text: inside Vincent's mansion... a kind of
text: apparition within his computer.
text: Garth studies the face. It reminds him that once flowers
dialog: bloomed, that there was hope in the world, that people were
text: young and beautiful. He closes the notebook lid.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 18.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: She controls all of the security systems?
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Yes. As well as maintenance and repair.
dialog: As I said, the Vincent mansion is fully
dialog: automated.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Is she programmed to kill?
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: Oh yes. If necessary.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: How do I defeat her... the system, I
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: You defeat each subsystem separately. But
dialog: in order to defeat the entire system, you
dialog: must shut down the reactor. It's located
text: in the basement, along with the
text: supercomputer that controls everything.
dialog: Obviously, this area presents the
dialog: greatest challenge.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Obviously.
speaker_heading: REICH
dialog: There is one additional thing I haven't
dialog: mentioned yet... research that Vincent
dialog: was doing... the last copy of which may
dialog: be in the computer. I want you to

speaker_heading: GARTH

text: STEAM RISES FROM HIS BODY ARMOR.
text: Garth's closed eyes twitch.
text: Slowly he comes to.
text: He glances at his body armor wrist read-out.
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 37.
speaker_heading: WRIST READ-OUT
text: Garth's body armor wrist read-out: 09.
speaker_heading: GARTH
text: realizes that another blow like that will penetrate his body
text: armor and kill him.
dialog: Should he move?
text: Carefully, Garth moves one arm back several inches, then the
text: other. A leg rises, seeks footing. He shoves himself a foot
text: farther away from the weapons in the walls and ceiling.
text: Again. Again. Slowly. Trying not to draw fire. Again.
text: Garth freezes.
speaker_heading: DIANA LOGAN
text: stands in Garth's path looking down at him. She is not quite
text: real. She is not quite a ghost, either. She wears an outfit â€”
text: military tunic and slacks â€” that, while very feminine, is
dialog: also all business.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You are an intruder.
text: Garth can't quite believe he's not alone. He raises a leg,
text: moves his shoulders, and shoves himself another foot away
text: from the weapons... and into Diana, passing through her. He
text: looks for her source.
scene_heading: GARTH'S POV - THE IMAGE PROJECTOR
text: is a shoebox with wheels, stopped nearby. A beam of light
text: shoots out, PROJECTING Diana.
speaker_heading: GARTH
text: pushes himself along the floor again. Diana's feet seem to
text: grow out of his stomach.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Go away.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I have called the police and they are en
dialog: route... but you haven't caused any real
dialog: damage yet. Go now and we'll forget this
dialog: illegal intrusion.
text: Garth shoves himself along the floor again. He and Diana seem
dialog: to share feet.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: There are no police.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Of course there are police.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Talk to them lately?
text: This shuts her up.
text: Garth flips over and begins to crawl.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You can get up. You're out of range.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Yeah. Like I'm going to believe you.
text: Diana BLINKS OUT OF EXISTENCE.
text: The shoebox whisks away, engine WHINING.
text: Garth continues to crawl... rises to his feet... runs.
scene_heading: AT JUPITER - GARTH
text: leaps behind the statue for cover. Breathing hard, takes
text: stock of himself. Replaces the body armor battery. (Chink-
dialog: hum!)
scene_heading: BODY ARMOR READ-OUT
dialog: goes from 09 to 100.
speaker_heading: GARTH
text: Pulls a nightscope from his pack, clicks it into place on top

dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 39.
scene_heading: GARTH'S POV - NIGHTSCOPE - THE HALL

speaker_heading: DIANA'S VOICE

text: There's still time to get away.
speaker_heading: (SCENE) - GARTH
text: looks up from the scope. Diana stands near him, projected by
text: the shoebox.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I don't want you to get into trouble...
text: Garth swings the rifle around, lazily aims it at the shoebox.
speaker_heading: DIANA (CONT'D)
dialog: I know a way you can escape. If you'll
dialog: just trustâ€”
text: Garth fires. The shoebox EXPLODES, its parts spinning away.
text: Diana DISAPPEARS.
text: Garth brings up the rifle scope.
scene_heading: GARTH'S POV - NIGHTSCOPE - THE HALL
text: painted orange. The flash of the first round bleeds out
text: vision for a second. When it returns, Garth has moved the
text: sight to the next sensor, and fires.
speaker_heading: GARTH
text: takes out the final three sensors.
text: Digs out a pair of nightgoggles.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Hate these goddamn things.
text: Pulls them on. Stands.
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 40
scene_heading: GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE HALL

speaker_heading: GARTH
text: moves down the hall along one wall, looking up, pistol drawn.
text: He passes where he was knocked unconscious by the laser
dialog: beams.
scene_heading: GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE CEILING
text: Laser weapons hang by wiring, destroyed.
speaker_heading: GARTH
text: pulls off the nightgoggles, hangs them by the strap to the

text: He moves back toward his camp at Jupiter's feet.
speaker_heading: JUPITER - GARTH
text: drops the goggles back into the pack, sits on the pedestal.
text: Taking a swig of water from his canteen:
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: So, Jupiter, you're a god. What are you
dialog: going to do next?
dialog: (god's voice)
dialog: I'm going to Disneyland!
text: Garth sees the control panel door imbedded in the pedestal.
speaker_heading: GARTH'S FINGER

scene_heading: THIRTY, EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KIDS

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A BEAM OF LIGHT from behind Jupiter's head is the source for

dialog: recording.
text: Diana greets the children. She wears a tunic similar to the
dialog: previous one, slacks, hair tied back, business yes, but
dialog: womanly, too.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Hello, boys and girls... My name is Diana
dialog: Logan.
text: An unseen teacher prompts:
speaker_heading: TEACHER'S VOICE
dialog: Kids â€” you know what to say.
speaker_heading: THE CHILDREN
dialog: Hello, Ms. Logan!
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I'm the Chief of Security of this

dialog: your guide today. Can any of you tell me
dialog: who Mr. Vincent is?
speaker_heading: THE CHILDREN
dialog: Me! Me!... I know!... I raised my hand

text: Diana picks a shy little girl who has raised her hand.
text: Garth moves through the PROJECTIONS as if they're ghosts, or
dialog: he is.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Do you know?
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL
dialog: Theodore Vincent is the richest man in
dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Yes, some people say that... It may even
dialog: be true... But the Mr. Vincent I know
dialog: loves art more than anything else in the
dialog: world. He built this residence so that
dialog: someday it can be converted into a
dialog: museum.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: Just like the Getty!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 42.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Garth stops finally before Diana and studies her. This
text: PROJECTION is obviously a recording, and unaware of his
dialog: presence.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I'm not sure he would appreciate that...
dialog: but you're right... someday this
dialog: magnificent building will be like the
dialog: Getty, a museum for everyone to visit.
dialog: Today you're very lucky children, because
dialog: I'm going to show you what most kids
dialog: don't get a chance to see â€” the Vincent
dialog: treasures.
text: The children chortle their anticipation. The PROJECTION GOES
speaker_heading: DARK.
text: Leaving Garth standing in shadows.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: So that's what you were like... in life.
text: No one answers.
text: Garth shrugs off the mood, moves.
scene_heading: NOTEBOOK COMPUTER SCREEN - THE MANSION FLOORPLAN
text: The doors to either side of this hall lead to galleries, and

speaker_heading: GARTH

scene_heading: AT BRONZE DOUBLE DOORS - GARTH

speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: Garth opens the doors to the new gallery.
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 43.
speaker_heading: THE GALLERY

text: Garth stands at the threshold, pack, rifle, ready.
text: Nothing moves in the darkness.
text: Something in Garth's hands: The remains of the shoebox
dialog: device.
text: Garth tosses the twisted metal far into the gallery.
scene_heading: MIDDLE OF GALLERY - A SEALED BEAM

text: DIANA AND HER THIRTY KIDS MATERIALIZE in the darkness.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: This gallery is called 'The Greek Room'

dialog: One-two-three o'clock, four o'clock
dialog: rock... five-six-seven o'clock, eight

text: Pulls the nightgoggles down over his eyes. Leans in to the

speaker_heading: DIANA'S VOICE

speaker_heading: GARTH

speaker_heading: FIRES.
scene_heading: FAR CEILING - CAMERA AND WEAPON

speaker_heading: GARTH

speaker_heading: DIANA'S VOICE
dialog: ... Agamemnon, whose wife Helen was

dialog: Who knows what 'B.C.' means?

dialog: (etc. )
text: This leaves the two camera/laser rifles located in the

text: Garth dares to lean out, look up.
text: A LASER BEAM STRIKES, barely missing his head as he snaps
dialog: back.
text: Garth pulls the nightgoggles back over his eyes. Steeling

scene_heading: GALLERY - GARTH
text: leaps inside, rolling toward the nearest statue as LASER

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: GARTH
text: with the nightgoggles shoved high onto his forehead, walks

dialog: hand.

speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: That kid doesn't know anything, Helen...
dialog: You're a hotty.

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I know what I am.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: You're a program, a doppelganger...

speaker_heading: GARTH

speaker_heading: DIANA

text: Garth leaps out from behind the statue and lands on the tank.
text: The tank gun barrel tries to find Garth, who stands above it,
text: beyond its tracking range.
text: Garth pulls a survival knife, begins to pry open the tanks's
text: metal access plate.
text: The tank's treads SQUEAL as it accelerates toward the nearest
text: unadorned wall. Garth hangs on, prying with the knife.
text: The tank slams into the wall, almost throws Garth, backs up,
text: slams into the wall again.
text: Garth clings to the machine gun barrel, yanks off the access

speaker_heading: DIANA AND GARTH
dialog: study one another for a long moment before:
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: If you can't shut the damn things off...

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Warn you?
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: You know where everything is, don't you?
dialog: You know which machines are operational,

dialog: onesâ€”
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Really, this whole question would be a
dialog: moot point... if you just surrendered.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: So you can hold me for the police?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Certainly. You have less to fear from
dialog: them...
dialog: (looking back toward the

dialog: -.. than me.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: That might be a long wait.
speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: GARTH

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: DIANA (CONT'D)
dialog: If there really is no police, as you
dialog: say... then you've come to cut the power
dialog: and take everything. That...
dialog: (surveys him)

speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: If I cut the power, what becomes of you?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I will become what you say I already am.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Death as a blackout. I've feared worse
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Go now. Take whatever you find back
dialog: there. If you go forward, you won't

speaker_heading: HUMS.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Yeah, I've heard that before, too.

speaker_heading: DIANA'S SHOEBOX

scene_heading: IN A CORNER OF THE GALLERY - GARTH

speaker_heading: THE GUN

speaker_heading: GARTH
text: makes sure that he's within the four-foot fire-free zone

text: ELAINE is beautiful, with long, flowing red hair and skin the

speaker_heading: GARTH

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Elaine, let me take you home.
speaker_heading: ELAINE

text: This is a question he would rather not contemplate.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: I searched for you, Elaine, I did!
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: There was no food, Garth. There was
dialog: nothing. Our son was hungry. I kept
dialog: waiting for you to come, but... you
dialog: didn't. So I went out looking for food...
text: The market was empty. There were men
dialog: there, Garth. They raped me. Then they
dialog: butchered me and took my flesh to their
dialog: homes and fed their families with me.
dialog: This last thing I didn't mind. I saved a
dialog: child's life. At least, my body did.

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: (reaching to touch, but unable)
dialog: Don't mourn me, John. What's done is

scene_heading: INT. GALLERY
text: Garth snaps awake beside the wall. Nothing has changed from

scene_heading: GALLERY OF PAINTINGS - GARTH

scene_heading: GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - THE GALLERY OF LANDSCAPES

scene_heading: GARTH'S POV - NIGHTGOGGLES - GALLERY OF PORTRAITS
dialog: Again no sensors, or weapons.
speaker_heading: GARTH
text: advances into the hall. The SOUND is closer now, a haunting,
text: otherworldly wail.
text: Gath brings the pulse rifle up, checks the charge (100 in
dialog: green), advances.
text: The SOUND grows louder, louder yet, increasing in volume and
text: emotion, a noise so terrifying that its existence seems
dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: A GHOST
text: floats through the far doorway and turns, heading toward
text: Garth. It is the corpse of a man, arms and legs dangling,
text: eyes glowing red, the wordless wail rising from its throat.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: grins.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: Ah, a ghost...
text: Garth brings the pulse rifle up, takes his time aiming. He
speaker_heading: FIRES.
text: The ghost TWISTS IN THE HOLD OF SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS, writhing
text: and bellowing its unearthly, artificial SOUND until its

dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 63.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - GARTH
text: is so preoccupied with the ghost that he doesn't see the man-

text: The robot's momentum carries them past the sealed beam which
scene_heading: ACTIVATES YET ANOTHER DIANA 3-D projection.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Okay guys, this is the fun gallery, at

dialog: of real people from history...
dialog: (etc. )
text: Garth writhes in the hands of the robot, its STEEL FINGERS
text: CLOSING ON HIS BODY ARMOR, WHICH SPARKS WITH RESISTANCE.
text: Garth's single free hand slams against the robot's metal
dialog: skin, without effect.
text: Garth pulls the survival knife, rams it into a crevice in the
text: robot body, jerks it, snapping off the tip of the blade.
text: The robot turns with Garth's splayed body, moving for some
dialog: dark destination.
text: A last ditch effort, Garth slams the broken blade into one of
text: the paintings as they pass. The blade digs deep into the
text: canvas and is dragged an inch before the robot halts.
scene_heading: (SCENE) THE ROBOT'S SOULLESS EYES MEET GARTH'S
dialog: in crystal understanding: If the robot continues, Garth will
dialog: destroy the painting.
text: Moments pass as Garth's lungs suck air and sweat cascades

text: The blade moves a millimeter in the canvas flesh, a woman's
dialog: bosom.
text: The robot's eyes move to the painting, back to Garth.
text: One robot hand relaxes. On Garth's movement, the other.
text: Garth slowly pulls himself from the robot's grasp, steps
dialog: down.
text: While the steel hands are empty, GUN BARRELS LOCATED IN THE

text: Moments pass. Garth reaches for the fallen rifle.

text: Garth's fingers almost make contact with the weapon. Will he
dialog: have to release the knife in order to retrieve the rifle?
text: Garth gives up, withdraws his hand... and extends a leg,
text: makes contact with the rifle.
text: The robot whirls and accelerates down the gallery, its tracks
text: squealing in retreat.
text: Garth releases the blade and retrieves the rifle, brings it
text: up to shoot.
text: The first round hits the retreating robot as IT WHISKS
text: THROUGH THE 3-D IMAGE OF DIANA AND HER CHILDREN like an
text: aircraft through clouds.
text: Garth FIRES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN...
text: PULSE BOLTS STRIKE the robot repeatedly. It explodes in fire

text: An unearthly SOUND makes Garth spin around.
speaker_heading: MORE GHOSTS

speaker_heading: (SCENE) GARTH

speaker_heading: GARTH

speaker_heading: THE STATUES

text: in combat, lovers holding hands, others.
scene_heading: A STATUE OF A NUDE WOMAN
text: catches Garth's attention. He moves for the exhibit.
text: The statue is twice life size. She is gathering flowers to

speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: You're lying... First, your defense

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: THE HIDDEN DOOR

speaker_heading: THE LOCK IGNITES

speaker_heading: GARTH

scene_heading: THE VINCENT RESIDENCE
text: is a cavernous room, a vast "pleasure dome" to compare with
text: Kublai Khan's. Laser statuary, nudes mostly, illuminate the
text: shadows, a glowing Christmas tree effect. Fountains and ponds
text: divide the real estate, a waterfall across the room defines

scene_heading: THE VINCENT BEDROOM

text: crossbow seen earlier. Arms spring out, a trigger. The bolt
text: snaps into place with a flick of his wrist. Garth aims...
text: aims... and fires.
scene_heading: THE POD CONTROLLER - THE ACTIVATE NOW BUTTON
text: is pressed home by the flying bolt.
text: GARTH AND THE CREATURE
text: are blown back by the explosion.
text: Garth lands ten feet away. The GOO IS SLOWLY PROCEEDING UP
text: ONE ARM, changing his flesh, killing it. Garth rubs it, as if
text: to return circulation, but it doesn't help.
text: Garth sees the creature reforming, moving toward him. He
text: tries to move but he's been hurt far more than he thought. He
text: sags, waiting death.
speaker_heading: A DAMAGED ROBOT
text: from an earlier confrontation with the creature surges
text: forward. In its hands, a cable whose end has been stripped,
text: revealing naked wires. The robot spears the creature with the
text: cable. SPARKS AND SIZZLING FLESH. Moments pass as the
text: CREATURE CONTINUES TO LOSE VISCOSITY, sagging finally into
text: bags of amorphous jelly, and then decayed pools of chemicals.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 115.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Diana APPEARS, imperfectly due to damaged projector lenses,
text: on top of the robot, which drops the cable.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: (coughing)
dialog: I'm dying.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: No you're not. I can save you.
speaker_heading: GARTH
dialog: (laughs - bubbling blood)
dialog: No. I don't think so.
text: The robot scoops him up, pivots and moves for the stairwell
text: door, DIANA PROJECTED ON TOP and seeming to tend to Garth.
text: THE TRACKS OF THE ROBOT
text: pass over puddles of ooze, which cling.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. THE STAIRWELL - (SCENE)
text: The robot carrying Garth, crazily descends the steps,
text: dropping from step to step.
text: Smashes through the second landing door.
text: Crashes through the third.
text: Careens around the corner and through the final door.
scene_heading: THE ROBOT'S TRACKS
text: are beginning to SMOKE AND HISS as the creature transforms
dialog: the metal.
speaker_heading: GARTH AND DIANA
text: almost tumble from the robot as it throws a track and grinds
text: to a halt.
text: Garth's left arm is almost ash.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 116.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You must get up!... Get up!... Get up,
dialog: goddamn it! GET UP!
text: Garth is almost out. He looks questioningly at Diana, as if
dialog: to ask, Why?
speaker_heading: DIANA (CONT'D)
dialog: Get to the computer! John, listen to me,
dialog: you can still live... if you just get to
dialog: the computer!
text: Garth understands. He tries to lift himself from the robot's
text: arms, falls back, tries again.
text: Garth tumbles to the floor, tries to stand but his LEFT LEG
text: HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO WASTE MATERIAL. No living flesh there.
speaker_heading: DIANA (CONT'D)
dialog: Focus, John! Focus on me. You can do it.
text: DIANA'S IMAGE FLICKERS in the darkness, a wavering ghost. She
text: is tethered to the damaged robot, unable to go with him.
text: Garth begins to crawl.
scene_heading: DIANA DISAPPEARS FROM THE ROBOT and REAPPEARS, A BETTER
text: PROJECTION, near the computer where Vincent's lifeless body
dialog: lays.
speaker_heading: DIANA (CONT'D)
dialog: Fifteen feet, John. That's all it is.
text: Just fifteen feet.
speaker_heading: (SCENE) THE CREATURE
text: surges through the door.
text: Diana snaps around to look, as does Garth.
text: The creature too is not what it once was. The beast fights to
text: retain its form and motion, but moves forward.
text: Garth tries to crawl faster, but can't.
text: DIANA DISAPPEARS from the computer, and REAPPEARS at the
text: robot. Standing on its top, she directs it to turn around.
text: The remaining track spins the machine around.
text: Garth forces himself to go faster.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 117.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Diana commands the robot's arms to snap menacingly. This is
text: the only weapon that remains.
text: The creature advances.
text: Garth uses furniture to pull himself forward. He's on his
text: knees now.
text: The robot's arms snap as the creature advances.
text: The robot and creature meet. The snapping arms are
text: meaningless. The CREATURE SWALLOWS THE ROBOT as DIANA'S IMAGE
text: WAVERS, CRACKLES, AND DISAPPEARS.
speaker_heading: (SCENE) DIANA
text: REAPPEARS beside the computer.
text: She watches with mute horror as the creature absorbs the
text: robot, rises to its full height, and then FLINGS A PORTION OF
text: ITS MASS AT GARTH.
text: The GOO HITS GARTH just as he rises to push Vincent's body
text: from the couch. The body topples onto the floor as Garth
text: screams in pain.
text: The GOO SETTLES INTO HIS BACK, sizzling.
text: Garth loses control of his body, collapses to the floor.
text: Portions of his back, waist, one leg, one arm are already
text: lifeless.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I can't do this for you! You must get up
dialog: onto the couch! Now! NOW!
text: Garth shakes the grogginess away as A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS
speaker_heading: HIM.
scene_heading: (SCENE) THE CREATURE,
text: its mass increased by conquest, has risen to its full height
text: less than five feet away.
text: Garth rises on one leg as the other drops away from his body,
text: a fallen cigarette ash.
text: One last Herculean effort, Garth jumps up onto the couch.
text: The CREATURE FALLS UPON HIM, swallowing him whole.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 118.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Diana gasps in surprise and regret.
text: Garth's GOOD HAND JUTS UP THROUGH THE GOO, pulls the temple
text: probe down to where his forehead is located beneath the
dialog: creature.
text: The vast computer's HUM increases.
text: The outline of Garth's body jumps, then shakes in death
text: rattle.
text: Diana throws the full power of EnCrypt into the chair making
text: contact with the amoebic goo. EnCrypt's dormant synaptic
text: power rises to a terrible HUM. The creature fries, this time
text: not dissolving but burning. Pieces fly away, ashes fallen
text: from a bonfire. A BELLOWING MOAN rises from the creature as
text: it crumbles into hot dust.
speaker_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: EXT. A MEADOW ABOVE THE OCEAN - DAY
text: Wild flowers are in bloom. The sea wind gusts gently.
text: Garth stands staring out to sea. He wears casual clothes,
dialog: clean, carefree.
text: A hand reaches out for him. Garth takes it.
text: PULL BACK to reveal Diana. Wearing a sun dress and holding a
text: hat on her head against the wind. She smiles.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL that this is a television screen in the
text: EnCrypt computer room.
text: PULL BACK TO THE CEILING... THROUGH THE CEILING... THEN THE
text: NEXT, AND THE NEXT... TO THE ROOF... TO THE SKY, WHERE THE
text: STORM IS RAGING AND THE POD SEEDS ARE SWIRLING... ABOVE THE
text: STORM...
text: PULL BACK TO THE EARTH ITSELF, SPINNING ON.
