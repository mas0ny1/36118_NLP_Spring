speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. CASTLEMAN BEDROOM, CONNECTICUT -- NIGHT, OCTOBER 1992 1
text: CLOSE ON the rumpled empty, half of a bed. The bedside table
text: holds a stack of novels, a pair of reading glasses, note
text: pads, pencils.
text: All is silent except for the hum of a digital clock. We see
text: the face of the clock click to 2:45 AM.
text: Then we hear the creak of floor boards and the lumbering
text: footsteps of a man returning to bed. The space in the bed is
text: filled with the figure of the novelist JOSEPH CASTLEMAN,
text: early 70's. He has the anxious, exhausted look of someone
text: who doesn't have a prayer of sleeping. Joe is a handsome,
text: aging Brooklyn boy turned literary giant. He has the beard
text: and the bearing of a proper eminence grise but he is also an
text: unapologetic sensualist. He embraces all that life has to
text: offer with a greedy, passionate vigor -- which, the critics
dialog: tell us, is what makes his writing so rich.
text: CRINKLE, CRINKLE, CRINKLE...Joe starts unwrapping a package
text: of Hostess Snowballs which he’s brought back to bed with him.
text: Next to him, JOAN CASTLEMAN, his wife of 40 years, is on her
text: side, eyes shut, but awake, trying for sleep. She's five
dialog: years his junior -- an elegant, educated, deeply self-
dialog: possessed shiksa from the upper-east side who was bred to be
text: a muse and helpmate to some brilliant, charismatic man.
scene_heading: CRINKLE, CRINKLE...
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Joe. What’re you doing?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm hungry.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Don't eat sugar, it'll keep you up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Listen, if it doesn’t happen I
dialog: don't want to be around for any of
dialog: those sympathy calls. Let’s get
dialog: out of here. Let’s rent a cabin in
text: Maine and stare at a fire.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: That sounds cheerful.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh fuck it.
text: Joe devours the Snowball then brushes the crumbs off and
text: rearranges his pillows. Then he turns on his side and goes
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 2.
text: about the business of seducing his wife. He searches the
text: folds of her nightgown for a breast.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Don’t.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don’t what?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Don’t pretend you’re interested in
dialog: sex just because you’re climbing
dialog: the walls.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Come on, just a quickie. It'll
dialog: help us sleep.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I was asleep.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You shouldn't be. It's unnatural.
text: Joe starts fondling Joan’s breast.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't have to do anything.
dialog: Just lie there.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Darling, this is pathetic.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But in the best sense of the word.
dialog: Pathos...eros...
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Fine. Go ahead.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Pretend I'm some young,
dialog: inarticulate stud who's found you
text: lying naked on a beach...
text: Joe slips his hand under her nightgown.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
text: His hand is big and tan, blond
dialog: knuckle hair, middle-finger
dialog: probing...
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Mmm.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: And now he's pulling out his huge,
text: swaying, tumescent cock.
speaker_heading: 1A
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 3.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: Oh God, Joe, enough!
text: Joan hikes up her nightgown and Joe moves on top of her. He
text: enters her and they go about the business of fucking. He
text: comes quickly with a furious yell.
text: Joe rolls off her and Joan rearranges herself and settles
text: back down to sleep.
text: Joe lets out a huge sigh, fidgets.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Do you want a sleeping pill?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Nah, I don’t want to wake up
dialog: groggy, just in case. Fuck them,
dialog: why do I care so much? I'm too old
dialog: for this shit. Bastard fucks.
text: His vitriol spent, Joe nestles himself against Joan and takes
text: her hand and places it on his head so she'll stroke his hair.
text: She obliges him, running her hand through his hair to soothe
dialog: him to sleep.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: G'night, Joe
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Love you, Joanie...g’night.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLEMAN HOME -- DAWN 1A
text: Birds are starting to chirp as dawn breaks on the Castleman
text: home: a charming old Connecticut farmhouse, an appropriate
dialog: residence for a famous novelist.
text: We hear a PHONE start to ring inside.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLEMAN BEDROOM AND HOUSE -- EARLY MORNING 2
text: Joe and Joan are fast asleep, each sprawled on their separate
text: sides of the bed. Dawn is just breaking. We hear birds
text: start to chirp outside. The phone rings.
text: On the second RING, Joe wakes up with a start and grabs the
dialog: phone.
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 4.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Hello?
text: We hear crackling on the other end and the voice of a man
text: from a distant land.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE)
dialog: Hello. Am I speaking to Mr. Yoseph
dialog: Castleman?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes. Yes you are.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE)
dialog: This is Mr. Arvid Engdahl calling
dialog: from the Nobel Foundation in
dialog: Stockholm, Sweden.
text: Joe presses his hand to his chest. Joan has woken up.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: This is not a joke, I take it.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE)
dialog: No, no, Mr. Castleman, I assure
dialog: you. If you like I will give you
dialog: the phone number here and you can
dialog: call back to confirm.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well thank you, that won't be
dialog: necessary.
text: Joe nods to Joan that this is it.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Before you go on, can my wife Joan
dialog: get on the extension?
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE)
dialog: Yes, of course, I'll wait.
text: Joe madly gestures to Joan to GO.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE -- EARLY MORNING 3
text: Joan is now grabbing the phone on the desk. She's surrounded
text: by book shelves, which are mostly housing all the various
text: editions and translations of Joe's prodigious work.
text: She can hear Arvid and Joe chatting about the weather in
dialog: Stockholm.
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 5.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello, I'm on.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE)
dialog: Hello Mrs. Castleman, is that you?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Yes it is.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE)
dialog: Mr. Castleman, you are still on as
dialog: well?
speaker_heading: JOE ON PHONE
dialog: Yes I am.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE)
dialog: It is my great honor and pleasure
dialog: to tell you Mr. Castleman, that you
dialog: have been chosen to receive this
dialog: year's Nobel Prize in literature.
text: Joan lets out an involuntary gasp.
speaker_heading: JOE ON PHONE
dialog: Well, thank you, thank you very
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE)
dialog: Mr. Castleman, we are so delighted
dialog: to be giving you this prize. Your
dialog: career has a truly remarkable span
dialog: to it.
text: Joan grows very still as she listens to Arvid's praise.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
dialog: Not only do you write with
dialog: extraordinary intimacy, wit and
dialog: depth, you have also challenged the
dialog: novelistic form in ways that will
dialog: affect generations of writers to
dialog: come.
speaker_heading: JOE ON PHONE
dialog: Well, I should be getting something
dialog: for all the grey in my beard.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE)
dialog: (laughing at the great
dialog: man’s joke)
dialog: Ah! Indeed, yes! And thank you for
dialog: doing so on the world’s behalf!
text: Joan's eyes are closed, her hand on her heart as she
text: continues to absorb this news.

speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
dialog: Mrs. Castleman --
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL (ON PHONE)
dialog: You should know that your husband
dialog: will be fending off the press
dialog: today, so what I advise is that you
dialog: monitor his calls, as it does get
dialog: quite exhausting.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (a slight pause)
dialog: Yes, I'll take good care of him.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL
dialog: Mr. Castleman, I'm sure you would
dialog: like to make a few calls of your
dialog: own, so I shall leave you to your
dialog: celebration. We will contact you
dialog: later with all the specifics.
dialog: Again, many congratulations to you.
speaker_heading: JOE ON PHONE
dialog: Thank you very much. Good bye.
speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL
dialog: Good bye.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Good bye.
text: STAY ON Joan. She's overwhelmed.
text: We can hear Joe shouting for her.
speaker_heading: JOE (0.S.)
dialog: Joan! Joanie!
text: Joan doesn't move. She still needs a moment to herself.
speaker_heading: JOE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Joanie! Where are you?!
scene_heading: INT. CASTLEMAN BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING
text: Joan is coming back into the bedroom and she sees Joe
text: standing on the bed.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: C'mon, get up here! Let’s jump!
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 7.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: For joy! C’mon, join me.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: We'll break the bed.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Quit being so middle class. Get up
dialog: here.
text: Joan climbs up on the bed with Joe and stands unsteadily on
text: the mattress. Joe starts to bounce. Joan lets out a little
text: shriek. Joe takes her hands.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I'm going to fall.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No you aren't.
text: He bounces a little more.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Joe, be careful.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Screw careful. Come on, jump!
text: Joan starts bouncing with him, laughing, giddy.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: (in a silly sing-song)
dialog: I won the Nobel, I won the Nobel!
dialog: La-la, la-la la la!
speaker_heading: JOAN
text: Joan stops bouncing.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What.
text: Joan doesn’t say anything, just shakes her head.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Joanie. Come on. I’m just being
dialog: silly.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I need to take a shower. We have a

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I know, Darling.

scene_heading: INT. CASTLEMAN HOME, LIVING ROOM -- SEVERAL DAYS LATER, DAY 5
text: A celebration party. FRIENDS and FAMILY are gathered in the
text: well-appointed living room artfully furnished with good rugs
text: and limited-edition black & white art photos.
text: Joe's New York publishing team -- his AGENT, EDITOR and
text: PUBLISHER -- arrive. They’ve all come up from Manhattan in
text: their good suits to lavish Joe with pricey bottles of wine.
text: His agent and editor are younger than Joe -- he’s outlived
dialog: the last bunch. But his longtime publisher, HAL BOWER, 70's,
text: is still vital and a dapper dresser. He gives his star
text: writer a bear hug and booms his congratulations.
text: We see a motley collection of Joe’s longtime WRITER FRIENDS
text: bent over a table of catered food, consuming large amounts of
text: Joe's food and liquor to make up for the fact that they
dialog: didn't get the Nobel.
text: We see Joan with an icy glass of white wine in her hand,
text: standing with the WRITERS WIVES who have the discarded look
text: of muses of unsuccessful men.
speaker_heading: DUSTY BERKOWITZ
dialog: «+.SO you’re going to Stockholm,,
dialog: when?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: December.
speaker_heading: DUSTY BERKOWITZ

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: No, I think I’1l be like any decent

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Joanie! C’mere.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Yes, Joe.

speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Hello there Joan! You’re looking

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Thank you, Hal, that’s very sweet

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: The New York Times is here.

dialog: Tell her.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: They're giving your husband the

text: They’re knocking out a story about
dialog: Bill Clinton for him.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Is this like an Avedon shot? With
dialog: all the pores showing?
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Every brilliant one of them, my

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Joanie, am I clean?
text: Joan checks Joe’s beard for crumbs.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You're fine.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Nose hairs?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: All good.
text: Joe is trembling a bit, wired from adrenaline. He clutches
text: Joan's arm and murmurs into her ear.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Tell me this isn’t all some big fat
dialog: joke.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: It’s real, Darling. Breathe.
text: They give each other a quick kiss and Joe turns back to his
dialog: people.
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 10.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay, let’s do this!
text: Joan watches Joe and Hal head to the library. We see them
text: from Joan’s P.O.V., through the open door as the TIMES
text: PHOTOGRAPHER directs Joe to stand with his arms crossed, in
text: the stance of a literary giant. She turns to go back to the
dialog: party but she can’t face the writer’s wives who’ve been
text: watching her with their sad, resentful faces.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLEMAN HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Joan has escaped to the kitchen where CATERERS are setting
text: more food out on trays. She’s poured herself a glass of
text: wine. We see her daughter SUSANNAH (30), a capable young
text: woman who’s hugely pregnant, setting champagne flutes on a
dialog: tray.
speaker_heading: SUSANNAH
dialog: Mom, when do you want to bring out
dialog: the champagne?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh, I don’t know. The sooner the
dialog: better. Then they'll all go home.
text: Joan puts her hands on her daughter’s big belly.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello my baby’s baby, I’m ready for
text: a nap.
speaker_heading: SUSANNAH
dialog: Poor, Mommy.
text: Joan's son DAVID (28) wanders in with an expensive box of
text: cigars tucked under his arm. He's a tortured young man, who
dialog: has Joe's handsomeness and intelligence but none of his
dialog: aplomb.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Hello, Lamb, there you are.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, sorry I'm late. I was looking
dialog: for some decent cigars to give to
dialog: Dad.
speaker_heading: SUSANNAH
dialog: I didn’t get him anything. Was I
dialog: supposed to?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: No, Honey, he’s been lavished

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: David, I wanted to tell you, your
dialog: father showed me your short story.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I thought it was beautifully
dialog: written.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: We haven’t discussed it yet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He hated it.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: No, not at all. It’s a wonderful
dialog: piece of writing, David. It’s very
dialog: astute. About the mother.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: In the library having his picture
dialog: taken. The Times.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah.
text: David gets out his cigarettes.
speaker_heading: SUSANNAH
dialog: David, you can’t smoke next to me.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Honey, are you hungry? Go get

speaker_heading: DUSTY BERKOWITZ
dialog: David, hello. So how’re your

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (never in a million years)
dialog: Sure.
text: David escapes her clutch and wanders over to the library.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY --DAY 7
text: Joe is with Hal and the Times photographer, having his photo
text: session. He’s posing next to a wall of book shelves lined
dialog: with his prodigious output of the last several decades. He's
text: holding his first novel, THE WALNUT, with its 1950’s artfully
text: simple book sleeve (very Catcher in the Rye).
text: A clutch of Joe’s GRADUATE STUDENTS from Yale are also there,
text: watching their beloved professor get photographed. David
text: glances at these young acolytes of his father’s, feeling just
text: a tad of resentment.
text: Joe sees David watching him and he raises his eye brows a
text: bit, trying to look bemused for his son’s sake. The
text: photographer takes a rapid series of shots.
text: Joe turns to David.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: David! You just get here?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah.

dialog: Here. Congrats, Pop.

scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 13.
text: Joe starts walking him back to the living room. David gets

speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: You still smoking?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You care?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Of course I care. I’d like to see
dialog: you outlive me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So did you read my piece?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes. We’1l talk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So is it a piece of shit?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why do you do that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because you're clearly avoiding the
dialog: subject.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No, clearly I’m completely
dialog: distracted at the moment. We’1l
dialog: talk when it’s appropriate, all
dialog: right?
text: Joe sees Joan coming out of the kitchen with Susannah,
text: carrying a large tray of glasses which are filled with
dialog: champagne.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Joanie, you okay there? David,
dialog: help your mother out.

dialog: Get yourself a glass.
speaker_heading: SUSANNAH
dialog: I'm not drinking.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A little champagne won't hurt the
dialog: baby, go ahead.
text: Everyone has organized themselves around Joe, their glasses
text: poised, the champagne effervescing.
text: David has stubbed out his cigarette and he stands by Joan,
text: who puts her arm around him and gives him a little squeeze.
text: Susannah stands on the other side of Joan and Joan tucks her
text: hand through her daughter’s arm, wanting comfort of her kids
text: by her side.
text: Joe, collecting his thoughts, shuts his eyes and waits for
text: everyone to settle down. Once the shushing stops, Joe
text: begins.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: To quote from The Meditations of
dialog: Quixote, "I am I, plus my
dialog: surroundings. And if I do not
dialog: preserve the latter, I do not

dialog: Joanie, come back here. I’m not

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Someone please get him to wrap this
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: To Joseph Castleman, who, in my
dialog: opinion, is the greatest living
dialog: author of the twentieth century and
dialog: now, God dammit, the rest of the

text: A chorus of “here here’s!” and clinking glasses while Joe
text: waves everyone off. Joe slips his arm around Joan and murmurs
text: into her ear.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Talk to me.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Blah-blah-blah, Darling.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLEMAN HOME, LIVING ROOM -- LATER, DUSK 8

text: Joan is lying on the couch with a wash cloth on her forehead.
text: Susannah and her husband Mark come in with their coats on.
speaker_heading: SUSANNAH
dialog: We're leaving, Mommy.

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I love you, Honey.
text: He gently touches her pregnant belly.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Take care of this one, Sweetheart.

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM, SMITH COLLEGE -- DAY, FALL 1956 9
text: We see YOUNG JOAN, 19, a fresh-faced coed in a tartan skirt
text: and matching blue sweater sitting at a desk with the other
text: SMITHIES, all waspy, well-heeled girls like herself. While
text: they wait for the professor to arrive, SMITHIE GIRL LORRAINE,

scene_heading: SMITHIE GIRL LORRAINE
dialog: ...when we were in France this

text: The door flings open and young Professor Castleman enters,
text: looking handsome and disheveled.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOE
dialog: Sorry I'm late.
text: He drops a pile of books on his desk. Even in his distracted

dialog: sit up.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOE (CONT’D)
dialog: I do have a good excuse, however.
dialog: My wife had a baby last night.
text: The girls react with "awww"'s. Except for Lorraine and Joan,

text: She puts the baby down on the bed and picks up a book --
dialog: James Joyce's Ulysses.
text: She opens it up and sees Joe's name written inside the fly

text: runs her fingers over it, her heart racing. She carefully
text: replaces the book next to some walnut shells littering the
text: top of the table. She sees a small, piece of walnut meat

dialog: So when I come home from school

dialog: appetite!"
text: The English speakers laugh. While Walter translates for the

speaker_heading: ARVID ENGDAHL
dialog: If I may brag for James for a
dialog: moment -- his children are all
dialog: quite remarkable. Ellen is doing

speaker_heading: JAMES FINCH
dialog: Yes, I'm counting on her to find
dialog: the cure to Alzheimer's just in

speaker_heading: JOE

dialog: And next time, don't refer to me as

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: "He's developing his voice?" What
dialog: is that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I don't believe in bragging, David.
dialog: It's vulgar. And the fact is, you
dialog: are developing your voice. It
dialog: takes time just as it took time for
dialog: me to develop mine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No it didn't. You had a hit novel

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I did read it as a matter of fact.
dialog: And my opinion is that it’s a good

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (over him)

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh please, it’s not easy being

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You could act a little prouder of

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He needs to work a little harder.
dialog: It wouldn't be doing the kid any

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I think he has talent.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Then you should tell him.
speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Mmm.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Whatever you do, please don’t thank

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why not? You should be thanked.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I don’t want to be seen as the long-

dialog: that, can’t you?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I have to, Joanie. Everyone thanks

speaker_heading: ELAINE MOZELL
dialog: But you know what? The public

speaker_heading: YOUNG JOAN
dialog: Whose?
speaker_heading: ELAINE MOZELL
dialog: The men who write the reviews, who
dialog: run the publishing houses, who edit

dialog: who gets to be taken seriously, who
dialog: gets to be put up on the pedestal
dialog: for the rest of their lives. Who
dialog: gets to be King Shit.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOAN
dialog: But a writer has to write.
speaker_heading: ELAINE MOZELL
dialog: A writer has to be read, Honey.
text: Elaine sets her empty drink on the book shelf and walks off,

scene_heading: INT. BOWER & LEEDS PUBLISHING -- DAY, SUMMER 1958 29
text: Young Joan is carrying in a tray of coffee into the office

text: We see the publisher Hal Bower who’s now in his 40’s (we saw
text: him in his 70’s at the top of the film) having a meeting with
text: his editors, WHITE and LOVEJOY who are all pitching him
dialog: manuscripts.
speaker_heading: LOVEJOY
dialog: ...I have a writer who I think is
dialog: the next Henry Miller. He's a
dialog: hopeless drunk and will probably
dialog: self-destruct in a few years, so I
dialog: suggest we grab him now.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: All right, I'll give it a read.
text: Lovejoy holds his coffee cup up to Joan.
speaker_heading: LOVEJOY
dialog: Honey, top me off, will you?
speaker_heading: WHITE
dialog: I have a novel here by a lady
dialog: writer. It's about an American
dialog: family that spans three
dialog: generations. It’s great writing,
dialog: kind of brilliant in parts. But I
dialog: thought it was a little soft.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: Soft?
speaker_heading: WHITE
dialog: It's from the point of view of this
dialog: woman. I don’t know, just didn’t
dialog: grab me.
speaker_heading: LOVEJOY
dialog: Is she good-looking?
speaker_heading: WHITE
dialog: So-so.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: How about Jewish writers. Anyone
dialog: have any smart young Jewish
dialog: writers? All the big houses have

text: CLOSE ON Joan taking this in. She screws up her courage, and

scene_heading: INT. WAVERLY ARMS, JOE & JOAN'S ROOM -- EARLY EVENING, WINTER
dialog: 1957
text: Joan flings the door open to their sad little room,
text: breathless. Joe is cooking soup for their dinner on a hot
text: plate. He looks at Joan, afraid to ask.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOE
dialog: So what did he say?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOAN
dialog: Oh Joe, he loves it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOE
dialog: They want to publish it?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOE
dialog: C’mere. C’mere you.
text: Joe takes Joan’s face in his hands and kisses her.
text: Then they both start screaming for joy. Joe pulls Joan up on
text: the bed and they start jumping up and down -- the origin of
dialog: this ritual.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOE (CONT’D)
dialog: (in a sing song)
dialog: We're getting pu-blished, we're

text: Joan, lying deep in the folds of the eiderdown, wakes up with

text: the clock on the bedside table. It’s 1:15 AM.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND HOTEL, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 32
text: Joe is sitting alone at a table lit by a candelabra in the
text: middle of the darkened dining room having a late-night snack
text: of dense Swedish bread and fat-laden spreads.
text: He looks up and sees Linnea across the dining room taking his

scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 51.
speaker_heading: LINNEA
dialog: What a beautiful shot. The

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Would you like to join me?
speaker_heading: LINNEA
dialog: No, I must go home to bed.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Is it still snowing out there?
speaker_heading: LINNEA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Then I’1l send you out with this:
dialog: “His soul swooned slowly as he
dialog: heard the snow falling faintly
dialog: through the universe and faintly
text: falling, like the descent of their
dialog: last end, upon all the living and
dialog: the dead."
speaker_heading: LINNEA
dialog: How beautiful. Did you write that?
text: Joe gives her a pained smile and shakes his head no.
text: Linnea sees Joan standing in the doorway wearing her coat
text: over her nightgown. She’s come down from the room, looking
text: for him and has been listening to this exchange.
speaker_heading: LINNEA (CONT’D)
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: It is time for bed. God natt sov

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Yes, good night.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What is we blow this whole thing

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: If only.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: INT. CASTLEMAN SUITE, GRAND HOTEL -- NEXT DAY 33
text: Joan, up and dressed for the day, is sitting in an arm chair,
text: staring at Joe who’s fast asleep under the eiderdown. Her
text: face is unreadable.
text: There’s a knock on the door. She gets up and goes down the
text: hall and lets in the ROOM SERVICE SERVER who’s pushing a cart
text: elegantly set with breakfast.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Mr. Castleman will have that in the
dialog: library, thank you.

speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Joe...
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You need to get up. They’re

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Jesus...all right, I’m getting up.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Your lunch is here. Here’re your

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: To do what?

scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 53.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I don't know, maybe I'll take a

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: On some lousy tourist bus?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Joe, please. I'll be in a much
dialog: better mood if you let me go.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I just thought this was something

text: Joan sets down Joe’s heart pills.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You need to take one of these at
dialog: three. I’m setting the alarm on
dialog: your watch.
text: Joan puts Joe’s watch back on his bedside table and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND HOTEL -- DAY 34
text: Joan, freed of Joe's celebrity, is taking her own sweet time
text: walking through the lobby. No one is bowing and scraping, no
text: one is taking pictures, no one is hovering with awe in their
dialog: eyes...
speaker_heading: BONE (0.S.)
dialog: Mrs. Castleman...
text: Joan turns and sees Nathanial getting up from one of the

dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Nathanial.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: I’m not stalking you, I promise.
dialog: But I have something for you -- I
dialog: was going to leave it for you at

text: Bone pulls out an envelope and hands it to Joan.
speaker_heading: BONE (CONT'D)

text: Joan pulls out a hand-tinted post card, circa 1927, of some
text: young college women doing a skit, the caption: Northrop House
dialog: Follies, Smith College.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh, Northrop House. That was my
dialog: dorm.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: I know. The picture's a bit before
dialog: your time, but I thought you'd get
text: a kick out of it.
text: Joan is impressed by the gift but doesn't entirely trust
dialog: Bone.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Thank you, Nathanial, this was very
dialog: thoughtful.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Well, you've always been very kind
dialog: to me during my aborted attempts to
dialog: woo Joe. Listen, there’s a great
dialog: bar here, very nineteenth century.
dialog: You can imagine Strinberg getting
dialog: hammered there. Can I buy you a
dialog: drink?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh, I don't know how appropriate
dialog: that would be.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: It’s completely inappropriate. But
dialog: we're in Sweden in the dead of
dialog: winter and I don’t think either of
dialog: us should be left alone to our own
dialog: brooding thoughts, do you?
text: Bone is actually flirting with her. Joan finds it rather
dialog: enjoyable. Joe would be appalled. And that’s why she
dialog: says...
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: One drink. No more.
scene_heading: INT. THE GOLDEN ONION -- DAY
dialog: 35
text: Joan and Bone are now sitting in a quaint, wood panelled
dialog: tavern. It's a cozy, intimate place, good for losing one's

speaker_heading: THE WIFE

speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: ..-listen, I want you to know that
dialog: I’ve gotten an offer to write a
dialog: book about Joe. I wanted to tell
dialog: you so you don’t think I’m doing
text: anything behind his back.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: And is this going to be a scholarly
dialog: work?
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Yes and no.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Meaning what?
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Please don't take offense, but you
dialog: might as well know that I'm aware
text: of Joe's various indiscretions.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (unruf fled)
dialog: I'm sure you are. I imagine it's
dialog: all very juicy material for a
dialog: biographer.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: To be honest, it's a little
dialog: predictable. Most of your men
dialog: of genius seem to have overactive
dialog: libidos. And thanks to the
dialog: worshipful tomes put out by us
dialog: biographers, we're supposed to find
dialog: it all very charming and
dialog: forgivable. I don't, actually.
dialog: I think that kind of behavior is
dialog: rather appalling.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Please don't paint me as a victim.
dialog: I'm much more interesting than
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Oh, I know you are. Look, I don’t
dialog: want to make the wrong assumptions
dialog: about your relationship. So why
dialog: don't you set me straight?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh Nathanial, you're so trans-

text: Joan takes a careful sip of her drink.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: All right. You have an hour with

speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Thank you, Joan. I really do

scene_heading: INT. STOCKHOLM CONCERT HALL STAGE -- DAY 36

text: up for the broadcast.
text: James Finch and the other LAUREATES are gathered on stage for

text: Joe arrives with Walter in tow.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Mister Castleman, let me introduce
dialog: you to your fellow laureates.
dialog: Gentlemen, this is Joseph Castleman
dialog: who is to receive the Nobel Prize
dialog: in literature.
text: The other laureates pause in their conversations and turn to
text: Joe. They all shake hands as they’re introduced.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Professor Finch, you have already
dialog: met...this is Professor Chen Ling
dialog: who's receiving the prize in
dialog: chemistry...Doctor Karl Seigler,
dialog: our esteemed laureate in
dialog: medicine...and Sir Randall Meade
dialog: who's receiving the prize in
dialog: economics.
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 57.
text: Joe, intimidated by all this brilliance, is grinning and
dialog: hunting around for something pithy to say.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Well, to quote Groucho Marx, “I
dialog: never want to be a member of a club
dialog: that would have me.” However, with
dialog: this crowd I’d be an idiot not to
dialog: make an exception.
text: Hearty laughter from the great men.
text: Linnea is there with her camera. She takes a few quick shots
text: to capture this moment, then gives Joe a wink.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I will turn you over to Mr.
dialog: Lagerfelt who will instruct you on
dialog: the protocol for tomorrow’s
dialog: ceremony.
text: The impeccable MR. LAGERFELT steps forward.
speaker_heading: MR. LAGERFELT
dialog: Gentlemen, you will be entering
dialog: from this side of the stage, in
dialog: this order: Sir Meade, Professor
dialog: Finch, Mr.Castleman, Professor
dialog: Ling and Doctor Seigler. You will
dialog: take your seats here, indicated,
dialog: for now, by these signs with your
dialog: names. When it is your time to
dialog: receive your medal, you will walk
dialog: from your seat, to here. And you
dialog: will receive your medal from the
dialog: King.
text: Mr. Lagerfelt demonstrates with an OLDER GENTLEMAN who’s
text: standing in for the king and gives him the medal box.
speaker_heading: MR. LAGERFELT (CONT’D)
dialog: You shall then bow, making the
dialog: three reverences. Like so. We will
dialog: start with you Mr. Castleman.
text: Joe, feeling the other laureates’ eyes on him, can’t focus.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I’m sorry -- do I bow first?
speaker_heading: MR. LAGERFELT
dialog: You approach the king and then you
dialog: bow.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Ah -- sorry.
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 58.
speaker_heading: MR. LAGERFELT
dialog: No need to apologize. That is why
dialog: we are practicing.
speaker_heading: JAMES FINCH
dialog: It’s not rocket science, Castleman!
text: The other laureates chuckle good-naturedly but Joe grimaces a
text: bit. He approaches the gentleman playing the king who hands
text: him a stand-in for the box with the Nobel medal. Linnea is
text: clicking away, her camera feeling a little too close.
speaker_heading: MR. LAGERFELT
text: And now the three reverences.
text: Joe awkwardly bows in the three directions as Linnea
text: continues to take her shots -- click...click...click....
speaker_heading: MR. LAGERFELT (CONT’D)
dialog: Very good Mr. Castleman, you may
dialog: now return to your seat.
text: Joe is sweating.
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Do you smoke?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Not officially.
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 59.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: I would guess that Joe made you
dialog: give it up.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Yes, he wants to keep me healthy.
text: Joan takes a cigarette. Bone lights it for her. There’s a
text: hint of seduction in the gesture.
text: Bone pulls out a notebook.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: May I?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Go ahead.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: First fascinating query -- this is
dialog: the publisher's not mine: "What
dialog: does the Nobel Prize mean to Joseph
dialog: Castleman?"
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh God.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: What if I just quote what he said
dialog: to me on the plane, "it's not about
dialog: the prize, it's about getting up
dialog: the gumption to write the next
dialog: book."
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Perfect. Thank you.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: And what about you? How do you get
dialog: up the gumption?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: To get up in the morning?
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: To write.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I'm not a writer, Nathanial.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: I beg to differ. When I was
dialog: looking through the Smith archives
dialog: I found some of your stories that
dialog: were published in the college
dialog: journal. I read "The Faculty
dialog: Wife." It’s a beautifully written
dialog: piece.
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 60.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Thank you, but the fact is I had
dialog: potential and nothing more.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: And you don't regret giving it up?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: No, I had very low expectations of
dialog: what I could accomplish as a female
dialog: writer.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: But there were plenty of successful
dialog: women writers back then.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: A few. But I didn’t have the right
dialog: personality for it.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I’m quite shy. I don’t like to be
dialog: looked at.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: All right, I won’t look at you.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: How kind.
text: Joan takes a sip of her drink.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Did Joe encourage you to keep
dialog: writing?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Yes, but as I said, I didn't choose
dialog: to pursue it.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Because he was the writer of the
dialog: family.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Now Nathanial, if you’re trolling
dialog: for nuggets of bitterness you'll
dialog: find none here.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Speaking of bitterness, I've talked
text: to his ex, Carol.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: How is she doing?
scene_heading: THE WIFE FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT (16/12/16) 61.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: She's a psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh. Good for her. And their
dialog: daughter, Fanny?
speaker_heading: BONE
text: She's a dentist. Carol forgives
dialog: you, by the way.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I'm glad. Joe tried to keep in
dialog: contact with them...I urged him to.
dialog: We both feel very badly about that
dialog: chapter of our lives.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: She said to thank you for taking
text: him off her hands.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: She’s welcome.
text: Joan takes a drag of her cigarette, taps the ash. Bone is
text: watching her.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: I hope you know that Joe’s affairs
dialog: don’t have anything to do with you.
dialog: It’s a compulsion. I believe it’s
text: a part of his deep-seated fear of
dialog: inadequacy.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Well, aren't you the therapist.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Do you have anyone that you confide
dialog: in?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: No. But I don't really care to.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: And that's what makes you so
dialog: attractive. Your mystery.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: My God, Nathanial, are you flirting

speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Oh, probably. Why not?

speaker_heading: LINNEA (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. Castleman?
text: Joe turns and sees Linnea. She holds her hands up to show

speaker_heading: LINNEA (CONT’D)
dialog: I come to you unarmed. I could see
dialog: that I was getting on your nerves.
dialog: All that clicking in your face. I

speaker_heading: LINNEA

dialog: We must choose carefully.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Indeed.

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: LINNEA
dialog: I am usually very objective about

dialog: Very much.
speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: LINNEA
dialog: You have a wonderful face.

text: on his forehead, evidence of all that genius...
speaker_heading: LINNEA (CONT’D)
dialog: Your mind...where does it all come
dialog: from?
text: Joe can see that she wants to be kissed. How can he resist
text: her luscious young lips or the comforting territory of a

text: watch has gone off.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh shit.
text: He starts fiddling with his watch, trying to turn it off.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit. My pills.
speaker_heading: LINNEA
dialog: Your pills?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: For my blood pressure.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I think I should head back to the

speaker_heading: BONE (CONT'D)
dialog: I've read some of Joe's early work -
dialog: - some short stories I dug up ina
dialog: couple of obscure literary
dialog: journals. I hate to say it, but
dialog: they weren't so great.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Early work is rarely very readable,
dialog: I think you know that.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: But there isn't even a hint of his
dialog: mature voice. In fact your piece,
dialog: "The Faculty Wife" reads more like
dialog: early Castleman than these do.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: That doesn’t surprise me. Joe had
text: a very heavy hand as a teacher.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: Fair enough, but when I talked to
dialog: Carol, she said it was odd how his
dialog: writing got so much better after he
dialog: met you.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: That’s very generous of her.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: With all respect, I think you're
dialog: tired of his affairs, tired of
dialog: being invisible, tired of putting
dialog: your enormous talent into creating
dialog: the Castleman legend. And for the
dialog: health of your family, this might
dialog: be something you'd want to do.
dialog: David seems like a very unhappy
text: young man.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You have no business talking about
dialog: my children.
speaker_heading: BONE
dialog: No, you’re right. I apologize.
dialog: (gently)
dialog: I think you really do want to talk.
dialog: And I give you my word, I'll never
dialog: reveal my source. I’1ll be the bad
dialog: guy so you don’t have to feel like
dialog: you're betraying Joe. The truth
dialog: will be out and then you'd be free

speaker_heading: JOAN

dialog: Joe, it's only four-thirty.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But look how dark it is already!
dialog: Don't do this to me, don't

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I didn't disappear. I was gone for
dialog: a few hours.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What did you do all day?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I walked around, visited shops.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You’ve had a cigarette. I can smell

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I stopped at a cafe. It was filled
dialog: with smoke.

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You’re the one who’s the star of
dialog: the show, why would anyone possibly

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I don't like you lecturing me. I'm

speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Dammit, Joe, would you not leave

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I was hungry, I bought some

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Come on, Joanie.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Let me see it.
text: Joan grabs at the walnut. Joe tries to keep it away. They
text: wrestle over it like a couple of ten-year-olds.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What're you doing? You're acting
dialog: crazy.
text: Joan pries the walnut out of Joe's hand. She stares at the
text: half-completed inscription.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: So while I was out being the
dialog: drunken lush, you, the picture of
dialog: sobriety, were seducing the

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Nothing happened.

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Don't insult my intelligence, don't

dialog: Nothing happened! I was the one
dialog: who stopped it.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Well bully for you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yes bully for me! You know why I
dialog: stopped? Because I was thinking
dialog: about you sitting on some fucking

dialog: So? What do you think?

dialog: What. Tell me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOAN
dialog: Look. You asked me to be honest.

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: YOUNG JOAN
dialog: It’s deliberate, Joe. It’s about

speaker_heading: YOUNG JOAN (CONT’D)

scene_heading: INT. STOCKHOLM CONCERT HALL -- NIGHT 47
text: We see Dr. Ekeberg standing at the podium on the grand Nobel

text: KING GUSTAV OF SWEDEN, QUEEN SYLVIA, and the elderly CROWN
text: PRINCESS VICTORIA who are in their full royal regalia --
dialog: medals, ribbons, tiaras and all.
text: On the other side We see Joe sitting with his fellow

text: are there to bear witness to his lionization.
speaker_heading: DR. EKEBERG
dialog: With each book, Mr. Castleman, you
dialog: have challenged the novelistic form
dialog: and reinvented the very nature of
dialog: storytelling and of prose. You are
dialog: a master of style, yet your
dialog: characters are intensely real,
dialog: their journeys heartbreaking, their
text: portrayals intimate and deep.
text: We see Joan, sitting with the other LAUREATE FAMILIES. Next
text: to her is David’s empty seat. She’s staring at the stage,
dialog: listening to this man talking about her work, her voice, her
dialog: gift.
text: Up in the peanut gallery we see Nathaniel Bone in his rented

text: on his face.
speaker_heading: DR. EKEBERG (CONT'D)
dialog: The humanity in your writing
dialog: transcends the boundaries of class

dialog: words, but more importantly, you
dialog: are a master at portraying the

text: CLOSE ON Joe. We see that he’s dying inside but trying to

speaker_heading: DR. EKEBERG (CONT'D)

text: Constance Finch who’s so pleased and proud for all of them,
text: reaches over to Joan and give her hand a little squeeze.
text: There’s a reverent hush as Joe makes his way across the stage
dialog: to King Gustav.
text: Joe bows his head to the King. King Gustav says a few
text: laudatory words to him then hands him the Nobel medal which
text: is housed in a flat leather box. As they shake hands, a

text: And Joan joins the audience in applauding her husband's great
dialog: achievement.
scene_heading: INT. STOCKHOLM CITY HALL, THE BLUE HALL -- NIGHT 48
text: We’re now at the Nobel banquet which is housed in a vast,

text: wine glasses to accommodate the plethora of toasts. Seated

text: patient WIVES, all talking loudly, intoxicated by the event
text: and the generous amount of wine being served.
text: We see Joan and Joe sitting across from each other at the
dialog: table of honor with King Gustav and Queen Sylvia. Joe, just
text: trying to get through the night, has slipped back into his
text: role as the charming raconteur. He’s been across the table
text: from the two royals who are both hanging on to his every
text: word. Joan is between the King and a DIPLOMAT who's
text: conversing with the WOMAN on his other side. Having no one
text: to talk to, she’s staying engaged with her wine.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: «+.SO you brown the brisket in the
dialog: pot and then you add two cups of
dialog: water, some ketchup, some garlic
dialog: salt, and here's the secret
dialog: ingredient -- a tablespoon of
dialog: instant coffee.
speaker_heading: KING GUSTAV
dialog: Really. This is a typical recipe
dialog: of the American Jewish culture?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: No it's a typical reflection of

dialog: ready to tell the world.
text: Joe moves off without another word, leaving Joan breathless.
text: She takes a healthy gulp of her wine to possibly prepare

text: King Gustav politely turns to Joan.
speaker_heading: KING GUSTAV (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell me about yourself Mrs.

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Yes I do.

speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I'm a king-maker.

speaker_heading: KING GUSTAV
dialog: You know, my wife will tell you the

dialog: Your Majesties, Your Royal

speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: But really this honor belongs to
dialog: someone else. My wife Joan.
text: There's a great rustling as everyone in the hall shifts in
text: their seats to look at Joan. Joan girds herself.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Joan is truly my better half. She
dialog: has made it possible
dialog: for me to find the stillness, as
dialog: well as the noise, to create my
dialog: body of work. Without her, I am
dialog: certain I would not be standing up
dialog: here tonight. I would instead be
text: at home staring at a blank piece of
dialog: paper with my mouth open in
dialog: stupification.
text: Warm laughter.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: She has been my sanity, my
dialog: conscience, the inspiration for

dialog: had. Joan, you are my muse, my
dialog: love, my soul. And I share this
dialog: honor with you.
text: King Gustav stands, cuing the guests to all rise to their
text: feet to applaud the lovely Joan. Joan can’t believe that Joe
text: just reduced her to the wife yet again. She’s livid but she

text: We hear another trumpet fanfare and the lights in the hall

text: Joan picks up her purse and gets up from the table.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Where're you going?
speaker_heading: JOAN

text: Joan trips a little in her heels. Joe catches her.
speaker_heading: JOE
text: Joanie, slow down.

text: all, on Joan's gown.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Christ.
text: The server, aghast, starts making mad apologies in Swedish.
