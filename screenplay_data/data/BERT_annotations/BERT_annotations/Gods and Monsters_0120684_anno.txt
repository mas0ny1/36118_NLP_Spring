scene_heading: SHOOTING DRAFT
text: NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS
text: AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR
scene_heading: THIS SOFT COPY.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: MAIN TITLES BEGIN
text: Writhing pools of light and dark, out of which emerge images
text: from "The Bride of Frankenstein," directed by James Whale.
text: Elsa Lanchester, as the Monster's Bride, looks up, down,
text: left, right, startled to be alive. The Monster stares at
text: her. "Friend?" he asks, tenderly, desperately.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT (B &amp; W)
text: Lightning splits the black-and-white sky, revealing a single
text: shattered oak in a desolate landscape. Below, a HUMAN
text: SILHOUETTE stumbles through the darkness, the top of his
text: head flat, his arms long and heavy, his boots weighted with
dialog: mud.
text: Suddenly the storm fades. Light creeps into the scene, and
dialog: color, as we DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: THE PACIFIC OCEAN
text: melting into a hazy morning sky. In a box canyon off the
text: coast highway, we see row after neat row of trailer homes, a
dialog: makeshift village for beach bums.
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER - DAY
text: CLAYTON BOONE opens his eyes. He is 26, handsome in a
text: rough-hewn, Chet Baker-like way, with broad shoulders and a
text: flattop haircut. He grabs a crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes,
text: lights a bent cigarette.
text: Clay stands and walks bare-assed across the single tin room,
text: his head almost touching the ceiling.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY
text: Clay goes a few rounds with a weatherstained speed bag
text: that's set up behind his trailer.
scene_heading: INT. TRAILER - DAY
text: Clay towels off, glances at the morning paper. He moves
text: aside a pile of paperbacks on a card table until he finds a
text: calendar. His finger targets today's first appointment.
text: "10 A.M. - 788 Amalfi Drive."
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY
text: Clay steps out of the trailer, clean-shaven and dressed in
text: dungarees, a T-shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped
text: into one sleeve. He weight-lifts a secondhand mower onto
text: the bed of his rusty pick-up.
text: Clay climbs into the truck, slides the key into the
text: ignition. It takes a few tries but the engine finally turns
dialog: over.
scene_heading: EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Clay's truck sails down the road, "Hound Dog" blaring on the
scene_heading: radio. MAIN TITLES END.
scene_heading: EXT. COLONIAL-STYLE HOUSE - DAY
text: Sprinklers twirl on a grassy slope outside a rambling
text: clapboard house. Below, a swimming pool forms a perfect
text: rectangle of still water. A title reads: SANTA MONICA
scene_heading: CANYON. 1957.
text: The pick-up drives past. Clay parks in the back, hops out.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - HOUSE
text: A SHADOWY FIGURE stands at a window, watching Clay unload
text: his red power mower.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The shadow is a man with dove white hair, wearing a dress
text: shirt and seersucker jacket. This is JAMES WHALE, age 67.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'd have more peace of mind if the
text: live-in nurse were still here.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: She was nothing but bother. I not
dialog: like her, Mr. Jimmy not like her.
dialog: We do better if you live-in again,
dialog: Mr. David.
text: In the dining room, visible through open double doors, DAVID
text: LEWIS, 55, speaks softly with the housekeeper, HANNA. She
text: is a squat, muffin-faced Hungarian woman in her late 50s,
text: dressed in black, her hair cinched in a tight bun. She
text: speaks with a thick accent.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You'll contact me if there's an
dialog: emergency?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes, I call you at this number.
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Mr. Jimmy? More coffee?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What? Oh yes. Why not?
text: He moves into the dining room, sits opposite David.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Isn't Hanna a peach?
text: Hanna ignores him, returns to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She tells me you haven't been
dialog: sleeping well.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It's the ridiculous pills they
dialog: prescribe. If I take them, I spend
text: the next day stupid as a stone.
dialog: If I don't, my mind seems to go off
dialog: in a hundred directions at once --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Then take the pills.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I wanted to be alert for your visit
dialog: today. Especially since I saw so
dialog: little of you in the hospital.
text: The remark hits its target.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry, Jimmy. But with this
dialog: movie and two difficult stars --
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: "The fault, dear David, is not in
dialog: ourselves but in our stars."
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (too anxious to laugh)
dialog: You remember how a production eats
dialog: up one's life.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh, David. There's no pleasure in
dialog: making you feel guilty.
dialog: (stands)
dialog: You better go, my boy. You'll be
dialog: late for that aeroplane.
text: David extends his hand, but Whale draws him into a hug. As
text: he starts out, David points to a framed painting.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: By the way, I like the Renoir.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Goodbye, Hanna.
text: Hanna runs out of the kitchen to escort David to the door.
text: Whale drifts back to the window, watches as Clay revs up the
text: lawnmower, creating a cloud of white smoke. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF DUDLEY - DAY (1900)
text: A bean-pole child with flaming red hair (WHALE at age 12)
text: stares up at the coal smoke pouring from a seemingly endless
text: row of chimneys. We're in Dudley, a factory town in the
dialog: English Midlands region known as the Black Country.
speaker_heading: SARAH WHALE (O.S.)
dialog: Stop lagging behind, Jimmy. We'll
dialog: be late for church.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WHALE
dialog: Yes, Mum.
text: Whale runs to catch up to his six brothers and sisters. His
text: father, WILLIAM WHALE, frowns at the boy's prissy trot.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM WHALE
dialog: Straighten up, son.
text: Young Whale's movements thicken into a dim imitation of
text: manly reserve. The Whale family marches up a steeply
text: mounting street to Dixon's Green Methodist Church.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Whale's eyes tighten. He focuses on Clay Boone as he peels
text: off his T-shirt, revealing a tattoo on his upper right
dialog: forearm.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Hanna? Who's the new yardman?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Bone? Boom? Something Bee. I
dialog: hire him while you were in the
dialog: hospital. He came cheap.
text: Whale nods, chooses a walking stick. He emerges into the
dialog: sunlight.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Whale moves jauntily onto the front lawn, singing to
dialog: himself:
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: The bells of hell go ting-a-ling
dialog: For you but not for me.
dialog: Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling?
dialog: Grave where thy victory?
text: Whale steps up next to Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Mornin'.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: My name is Whale. This is my
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Nice place.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: And your name is --?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Boone. Clayton Boone.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I couldn't help but notice your
dialog: tattoo. That phrase? Death Before
dialog: Dishonor. What does it mean?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Just that I was in the Marines.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: The Marines. Good for you. You
dialog: must have served in Korea.
text: Clay shrugs nonchalantly.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Getting to be a warm day. A
dialog: scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Yeah. I better get on with my
dialog: work.
text: Whale clears his throat behind the back of his hand.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: When you're through, Mr. Boone,
dialog: feel free to make use of the pool.
dialog: We're quite informal here. You
dialog: don't have to worry about a suit.
text: Clay glances warily at Whale.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No thanks. I got another job to
dialog: get to this afternoon.
text: Whale holds Clay's look.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Some other time, perhaps? Keep up
dialog: the fine work.
text: Whale heads off, smiling to himself. Pleased to be naughty
dialog: again.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
text: The room is filled with unframed canvasses, many of them
dialog: copies of paintings by the Old Masters.
text: Whale rolls out the easel, lifts a half-painted canvas into
text: position. He stares at the blotches of color, trying to
dialog: remember what he intended to paint.
text: Whale pulls out a heavy volume on Rembrandt, opens to a
text: black-and-white plate of "The Polish Rider." We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE HOUSE - DUDLEY - NIGHT (1908)
text: A rough pencil outline of the same painting. Whale, age 16,
text: sits on his bed, ignoring the roughhousing of the three
text: younger BROTHERS who share the room. The door opens and
text: Whale's mother SARAH enters.
speaker_heading: SARAH WHALE
text: Jimmy. The privy needs cleaning.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I have my class tonight.
text: Both have Midlands accents, like head colds that flatten
text: their speech. Whale holds up the sketch to show his mother.
speaker_heading: SARAH WHALE
dialog: Don't get above yarself, Jimmy.
dialog: Leave the drawring to the artists.
text: Whale squeezes the pad behind the bed, jumps up.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Quite so, mum. To the privy.
text: And he heads cheerfully out of the room. His mother shakes
text: her head.
speaker_heading: SARAH WHALE
dialog: "Quite so."
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Jimmy Whale. Who are ya to put on
dialog: airs?
text: But Whale is already out the door. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Whale studies his face in the mirror. He gives his white
text: hair a few final licks with his silver-backed brush.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Whale comes in from the bedroom.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: There is iced tea, Hanna? Cucumber
dialog: sandwiches?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes, Mr. Jimmy.
dialog: (smiles)
text: An interview. After so many years.
dialog: Very exciting.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Don't be daft. It's just a student
dialog: from the university.
text: The doorbell rings.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Whale settles into his club chair and opens a book,
text: pretending to read until Hanna ushers in the visitor.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Mr. Kay, sir.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (feigning surprise)
dialog: Yes?
text: Whale looks up at EDMUND KAY, 22, a slim boy who rests his
text: weight on one slouched hip, his arms twined behind him.
text: There is a look of mild disappointment on Whale's face as he
text: realizes that Kay is a baby poof.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Ah, Mr. Kay. I'd almost forgotten.
dialog: My guest for tea.
text: Whale stands and holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Mr. Whale, this is such an honor.
dialog: You're one of my favorite all-time
dialog: directors. I can't believe I'm
dialog: meeting you.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (gently, teasing)
dialog: No. I expect you can't.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: And this is your house. Wow. The
dialog: house of Frankenstein.
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: I thought you'd live in a spooky
dialog: old mansion or villa.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: One likes to live simply.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I know. People's movies aren't
dialog: their lives.
text: He suddenly growls out an imitation of Boris Karloff.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Love dead. Hate living.
text: Kay laughs, a high, girlish giggle. Whale fights a cringe
text: with a polite smile.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That's my favorite line in my
dialog: favorite movie of yours. "Bride of
dialog: Frankenstein."
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Is it now? Hanna? I think we'll
dialog: take our tea down by the swimming
dialog: pool.
text: It's clear from Hanna's frown that she doesn't approve of
text: the idea. Whale ignores her, turns back to Kay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (opens the back door)
dialog: After you then.
text: Whale inspects the boy from behind, noticing his wide hips
text: and plumpish posterior.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
text: Kay's hands flap animatedly as Whale leads him down to the
dialog: pool.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I love the great horror films. And
dialog: yours are the best. "The Old Dark
dialog: House." "The Invisible Man." They
dialog: look great and have style. And
dialog: funny!
text: Whale points to a small shingled house near the pool.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: This is the studio where I paint.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Nice.
dialog: (refusing to be
dialog: sidetracked)
dialog: And your lighting and camera
dialog: angles. You're got to go back to
dialog: German silent movies to find
dialog: anything like it.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - UPPER PATIO - DAY
text: Clay Boone gulps some water from the garden hose. He
text: glances down at the pool, where Kay and Whale sit in
dialog: cast-iron chairs.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Time for you to leave.
text: Clay turns to Hanna, who holds a tray loaded with finger
text: sandwiches and a pitcher of iced tea.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm on my way.
text: She doesn't move until Clay starts off.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - DAY
text: Kay flips open his steno pad.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: So, Mr. Kay? What do you want to
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Everything. Start at the
dialog: beginning.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I was born outside London, the only
dialog: son of a minister who was a master
dialog: at Harrow. Grandfather was a
dialog: bishop. Church of...Church of
dialog: Eng...
text: Whale's tongue trips on the word, his voice suddenly drowned
text: out by the blast of a factory whistle. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FACTORY SHOP FLOOR - DUDLEY - DAY (1908)
text: Fiery melt is poured into molds on the shop floor of a
text: machine parts factory. WHALE, 16, grips the hot casting
text: with tongs. His father WILLIAM, his face blackened with
text: grime, hammers away at the flaws. A heavy blow causes young
text: Whale to drop the mold, prompting catcalls and sneers on the
text: floor. There is a look of genuine fear in Whale's eyes as
text: he looks up at his singed, beast-like father. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
text: Kay clears his throat softly.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Mr. Whale?
text: Whale smiles politely to cover his momentary disorientation.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Your father was a schoolmaster?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Of course. I attended Eton -- it
dialog: wouldn't do for a master's son to
dialog: attend where his father taught. I
dialog: was to go up to Oxford but the war
dialog: broke out and I never made it. The
dialog: Great War, you know. You had a
dialog: Good War, but we had a great one.
text: He glances to see if the boy smiles at the quip.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You can't imagine what life was
dialog: like after the Armistice. The
dialog: twenties in London were one long
dialog: bank holiday, a break from
dialog: everything dour and respectable. I
dialog: had a knack with pencil and paper,
dialog: so I was hired to design sets for
dialog: stage productions.
text: Hanna comes down the path with the tray. She places it on
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Thank you, Hanna. Very nice.
text: Hanna remains planted next to the table.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You can go now.
text: She makes an audible sigh and starts back up the hill.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: There was one play in particular, a
text: beautiful, grim study of war called
dialog: "Journey's End". Every experienced
dialog: director turned it down, so I
dialog: offered myself, bullying and
dialog: begging for the job. "Journey's
dialog: End" made the careers of everyone
dialog: associated with it. It was only a
dialog: matter of time until Hollywood
dialog: beckoned.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: How much longer before we get to
dialog: "Frankenstein"?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay,
dialog: that it's not me you're interested
dialog: in, only my horror pictures?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Oh no, I want to hear everything.
dialog: You made twenty pictures in all --
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Twenty-one. The romantic comedies
dialog: and dramas were much more to my
dialog: liking. The horror pictures were
dialog: trifles. Grand guignol for the
dialog: masses.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: But it's the horror movies you'll
dialog: be remembered for.
text: An abrupt look of anger flashes across Whale's face.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: No. I never said you were. Or
dialog: will be soon.
text: Kay leans over the steno pad, determined to be more worthy.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: So. "Journey's End" brought you to
dialog: Hollywood --
text: Whale takes in the boy's blank, bored expression. He sighs.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I have a proposal, Mr. Kay. This
dialog: mode of questioning is getting old,
dialog: don't you think?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I don't mind.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Let's make it more interesting. I
dialog: will answer any question you ask.
dialog: But, for each answer, you must
dialog: remove one article of clothing.
text: Kay's mouth pops open.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That's funny, Mr. Whale.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It is, isn't it? My life as a game
dialog: of strip poker. Shall we play?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You're serious.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Quite.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Then the rumors are true?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What rumors might those be?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That you were forced to retire
dialog: because, uh -- a sex scandal.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: A homosexual scandal, you mean?
dialog: For me to answer a question of that
dialog: magnitude, you'll have to remove
dialog: both your shoes and your socks.
text: Kay just sits there, squinting and grinning.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: You're a dirty old man.
text: Whale tilts his head as if brushing off a compliment. Kay
text: kicks off his penny loafers, bends over to remove his socks.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You are kind to indulge your elders
dialog: in their vices. As I indulge the
text: young in theirs.
text: Two pale feet emerge. Whale leans forward to examine them.
text: He leans back again.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No. There was no scandal.
text: And he reaches into his coat for a cigar. Whale's hand
text: trembles as he slices a hole at the base, then lights the
text: cigar with a wooden match, sucking and rotating until the
text: tip is roundly lit.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: My only other vice. I suppose
dialog: you'd like a fuller answer to your
dialog: question.
text: Kay nods.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It will cost you your sweater.
text: Kay hesitates a moment, then sets his pen aside to pull the
text: sweater over his head, revealing a sleeveless T-shirt.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You must understand how Hollywood
dialog: was twenty years ago. Nobody cared
text: a tinker's cuss who slept with
dialog: whom, so long as you kept it out of
dialog: the papers. Outside of Hollywood,
dialog: who knows who George Cukor is, much
dialog: less what he does with those boys
dialog: from the malt shops along Santa
dialog: Monica?
text: Kay stares at him in disbelief.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: George Cukor? Who made "A Star Is
dialog: Born"? I never guessed.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Take off your vest and I'll tell
dialog: you a story.
text: Kay plucks at his T-shirt, glancing toward the house.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Don't be shy. There's time to stop
dialog: before you go too far.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I guess.
text: Kay peels off the shirt and tosses it on his shoes and
dialog: sweater.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: George is famous for his Saturday
dialog: dinner parties. Great artists,
dialog: writers, society folk, all rubbing
dialog: elbows with Hollywood royalty. But
dialog: how many of those oh-so-proper
dialog: people know about the Sunday
dialog: brunches that follow? Gatherings
dialog: of trade eating leftovers, followed
text: by some strenuous fun and frolic in
dialog: the pool.
dialog: (flicks an ash)
dialog: If a goat like that can continue
dialog: about his business, my more
dialog: domestic arrangements could've
dialog: raised very few eyebrows.
text: The revelation seems to have left Kay a little shaken. he
text: flips to a blank page.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Can we talk about the horror movies
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Certainly, Mr. Kay. Is there
dialog: anything in particular you want to
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Will you tell me everything you
dialog: remember about making
dialog: "Frankenstein"?
text: He glances down at his few remaining articles of clothing.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Can that count as one question?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I can't believe I'm doing this.
text: Kay stands to unbuckle his belt, glancing around the yard
text: again. He unzips and steps out of his sharply creased
text: flannel legs. His thighs are thin and pale.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Just like going swimming, isn't it?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Maybe you'd like a swim when we're
dialog: through. I never swim myself, so
text: the pool tends to go to waste.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Okay. "Frankenstein." Tell me
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Righto. Let me see.
text: Whale swallows a wince, trying to block the pain pushing
text: against his skull.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Universal wanted me for another
dialog: story, and wanted me so baldly -- I
dialog: mean badly, not baldly. I was
dialog: given the pick of stories being
dialog: developed, and I picked that one.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Who came up with the Monster's
dialog: makeup and look?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: My idea. Muchly. My sketches.
text: Big heavy brow. Head flat on top
dialog: so they could take out the old
dialog: brain and put in the new, like
dialog: tinned beef.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: He's one of the great images of the
dialog: twentieth century. As important as
dialog: the Mona Lisa.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You think so? That's very kind --
text: Whale clutches at the air, suddenly notices that his hand is
text: empty. He looks down and sees the cigar on the flagstones.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Boris Karloff. Where did you find
dialog: him?
text: Whale bends down to retrieve his cigar -- and the change of
text: gravity drives a spike through his skull.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Karloff, Mr. Whale. How did you
dialog: cast him?
text: Whale turns toward the froggy voice.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Please. Excuse me. I must go
dialog: lie --
text: He forces himself up with one hand. Kay finally looks up,
text: notices Whale's colorless lips and desperate eyes.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Mr. Whale? Are you all right?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I just need to -- lie down.
text: Studio. Daybed in studio.
text: Whale lurches from the table. Kay jumps forward, catching
text: him under an arm.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Oh my God. What's wrong, Mr.
dialog: Whale? Is it your heart?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Head. Not heart.
text: He leans against Kay, who leads him toward the studio.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Forgive me.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Hanna runs down the path, clutching the front of her apron
text: in two tight fists.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
text: Hanna swings open the screen door -- and grimaces when she
text: sees Kay in his BVDs. He is kneeling next to Whale, who is
text: stretched out on the daybed.
speaker_heading: HANNA
text: Water. Glasses at the sink.
text: She goes to Whale, scooping different bottles from the
text: pocket of her apron.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Which ones? I bring them all.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Luminal.
text: She empties a pill into her palm. Whale places it into his
text: mouth and takes the glass of Water Kay passes over Hanna's
text: shoulder. Whale swallows the pill, then glances up at Kay,
text: feigning surprise.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Mr. Kay. You're not dressed.
text: Kay frantically crosses his arms over his chest and middle,
text: turns to Hanna.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I was going to take a swim.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'm sorry I spoiled it for you.
dialog: You should probably go home.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Right.
text: Kay hurries outside to retrieve his clothes. Hanna undoes
text: Whale's bow tie. She makes no attempt to be gentle.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I do not think you anything
dialog: anymore. Just back from the
dialog: hospital and already you are
text: chasing after boys.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh shut up. All we did was talk.
dialog: My attack had nothing to do with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Perhaps we should get you uphill
dialog: before the pills knock you cold.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No. Let me lie here. Thank you.
text: Hanna nods, moves to the door. Whale closes his eyes,
text: breathes deeply, trying to block the throbbing SOUND in his
dialog: brain. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FACTORY SHOP FLOOR - DUDLEY - DAY (1908)
text: The noise is deafening -- the clank of chains, the screech
text: of wheels and the endless banging of hammers. William Whale
text: continues to knock away at the hot casting. The rhythmic
text: sound blends into the insistent knocking of:

scene_heading: INT. CLAY'S TRAILER - DAY
text: Clay Boone's eyes dart open.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT (O.S.)
dialog: Boone! You awake? Eight o'clock.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Fuck off!
speaker_heading: DWIGHT (O.S.)
dialog: You told me to get you up, asshole.
text: A baseball-capped head is visible through the louvered glass
text: in the trailer's door. DWIGHT JOAD, 30, Clay's neighbor,
text: squints to see inside.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm up. Thanks.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Hasta la vista, Boone. And give
dialog: the jail bait a squeeze for me.
text: Clay glances over, seems surprised to see a naked back
text: facing him on the bare mattress.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Hey, um...Rose --
text: The girl stirs, turns to face him. She is 18 at most.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Daisy.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: My name is Daisy.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Time to go, Daisy.
text: She presses her naked body against Clay's.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You know. I could help you fix up
dialog: this place real nice.
text: Clay takes a deep breath, trying to clear the gumminess from
text: his brain.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Don't you have to be somewhere?
dialog: Like high school maybe.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I gave it up for Lent.
text: Daisy smiles at her own joke. Clay frowns.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Right.
dialog: (jumps up from the bed)
dialog: Time to hit the road, kid.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
text: Whale ponders the half-painted canvas, clearly distressed by
text: his lack of progress. The stillness is punctured by the
text: sound of Clay's lawnmower being dragged up the brick steps.
text: Whale smiles, puts down his brush.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
text: Clay stops, turns around, feeling someone's eyes watching
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: WHALE (O.S.)
dialog: (singing)
text: The bells of hell go ting-a-ling...
text: The mower slips out of Clay's hands momentarily. he looks
text: around, spots Whale inside the studio.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Just got away from me. Sorry to
dialog: disturb you.
text: The screen door squeaks open, clatters shut. A leather
text: slipper and rubber-tipped cane appear. Whale strolls into
text: view, smiling.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I was just about to ask Hanna to
dialog: bring down iced tea. I'd like it
dialog: very much if you'd join me.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I stink to high heaven right now.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: The honest sweat of one's brow. I
dialog: assure you I won't be offended.
dialog: Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for
dialog: two.
text: Whale's cane trembles in his skeletal hand. His frailty
text: chips away at Clay's resolve.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Or would you prefer a beer?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No. Iced tea's fine.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Splendid.
text: Clay hoses the crumbs of grass off his arms. He dries his
text: hands and arms with his hat, then wads it up and stuffs it
text: into his shirt to wipe out his armpits.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
text: Clay stands at the screen door.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Come in, Mr. Boone.
text: Whale sits on a daybed, next to a pile of newspapers. He
text: gestures at a wooden armchair across from him.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: My workshop, my studio. Hardly
text: somewhere in which a sweaty workman
dialog: should feel out of place.
text: Clay glances at the unframed canvases on the wall and
text: stacked in the corners.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: These are your paintings?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What? Oh yes.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You know what they say. If you
dialog: have to ask --
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm just a hick who cuts lawns.
text: But some of these look familiar.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: They were familiar when I painted
dialog: them. That one's copied from a
dialog: Dutch still life done almost three
dialog: hundred years ago. And that's a
dialog: Rembrandt.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: They're just copies then. Gotcha.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: But before I retired, you might say
dialog: I had a brief time in the sun.
dialog: Fame, as it were. Tell me, do you
dialog: like motion pictures?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Sure, everybody does. When I was a
dialog: kid I'd go with my sister twice a
dialog: week. Why? Were you an actor
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: In my youth, yes, but never in
dialog: Hollywood. No, I was merely a
dialog: director here.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Yeah? What were some of your
dialog: movies?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: This and that. The only ones you
dialog: maybe have heard of are the
dialog: "Frankenstein" pictures.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Really?
text: Clay sits up, surprised, skeptical and impressed all at
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: "Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and
dialog: "Son of" and all the rest?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I made only the first two. The
dialog: others were done by hacks.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Still. You must be rich. Making a
dialog: couple of famous movies like those.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Merely comfortable. Here's Hanna
dialog: with our refreshments. Can you get
dialog: the door?
text: Clay jumps up to open the screen door. Hanna walks past,
text: refusing to look at him. She sets the tray on a table very
text: hard, ringing the glasses and silverware.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy?
dialog: How is your mind today?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: My mind's lovely. And yours?
text: Hanna flares her nostrils at him.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You remember what the doctor tells
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Yes, yes, yes. I merely invited
text: Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea.
dialog: We'll have a brief chat and he'll
text: finish the yard.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I am not forgetting your last brief
dialog: chat.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Just go. We can manage without
dialog: you.
text: Hanna stares up at Clay.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: He looks plenty big. You won't
dialog: need my help if anything goes
dialog: flooey.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Go.
text: She shakes her head and marches out the door. Clay returns
text: to his chair and sits down again.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: When they stay in your employ too
text: long, servants begin to think
dialog: they're married to you.
dialog: (smiles at Clay)
dialog: Please, Mr. Boone. Help yourself.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What did she mean by going flooey?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I returned recently from a stay in
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What was wrong?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Nothing serious. A touch of
dialog: stroke.
text: Clay nods, chugs his tea. When he lowers the glass, he
text: finds the old man watching him.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You must excuse me for staring, Mr.
dialog: Boone. But you have a marvelous
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: To an artistic eye, you understand.
dialog: Have you ever modeled?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You mean, like posed for pictures?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Sat for an artist. Been sketched.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (with a laugh)
dialog: What's to sketch?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You have the most architectural
dialog: skull. And your nose. Very
dialog: expressive.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Broke is more like it.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: But expressively broken. How did
dialog: it happen?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Football in college.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You went to university?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Just a year. I dropped out to join
dialog: the Marines.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Yes. You were a Marine.
text: Whale's gaze deepens. He laughs lightly.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I apologize for going on like this.
dialog: It's the Sunday painter in me. Of
dialog: course I can understand your
dialog: refusal. It's a great deal to ask
dialog: of someone.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You mean -- you really want to draw
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege
dialog: of drawing your head.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: But why?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Even an amateur artist needs a
text: subject to inspire him.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: And it's just my head you want?
dialog: Nothing else?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What are you suggesting? You'll
dialog: charge extra if I include a hand or
text: a bit of shoulder.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You don't want to draw pictures of
dialog: me in my birthday suit, right?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I have no interest in your body,
dialog: Mr. Boone. I can assure you of
dialog: that.
text: Clay takes a moment to size up Whale -- whose innocent,
text: slightly befuddled smile makes him appear about as
text: threatening as a box of cornflakes.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: All right then. Sure. I could use
dialog: the extra dough.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Excellent. We'll have a most
dialog: interesting time.
text: Whale lifts his glass, takes a small sip of tea.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Clay fetches a pair of hedge clippers from his truck. He
text: can't help stopping by the side-view mirror to look at his
dialog: face.
scene_heading: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
text: Doctors and technicians flash lights into Whale's eyes...
text: test his reflexes...inject him with radioactive isotope.
text: Whale sits very still with his head behind a fluoroscope
text: screen while two doctors murmur over the image.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
text: A pair of X rays are slapped wet on a light board. Two
text: skulls, one facing forward, the other in profile. DR.
text: PAYNE, a bland young neurologist, points to a smudge in the
text: side-view X ray.
speaker_heading: DR. PAYNE
dialog: This is the area of infarction. By
dialog: which we mean the portion of brain
text: affected by the stroke.
text: The venetian blinds of the examining room are closed. Whale
text: sits calmly, flanneled legs crossed at the knees, gazing at
text: his own skull.
speaker_heading: DR. PAYNE
dialog: You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale.
dialog: Whatever damage was done by your
dialog: stroke, it left your motor
text: abilities relatively unimpaired.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the
dialog: neck up? What's my story there?
speaker_heading: DR. PAYNE
dialog: That's what I'm trying to explain.
text: Payne turns off the light board and goes to the venetian
text: blinds. The room is instantly full of sun.
speaker_heading: DR. PAYNE
dialog: The central nervous system selects
text: items from a constant storm of
dialog: sensations. Whatever was killed in
dialog: your stroke appears to have
dialog: short-circuited this mechanism.
dialog: Parts of your brain now seem to be
text: firing at random.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You're saying there's an electrical
dialog: storm in my head?
speaker_heading: DR. PAYNE
dialog: That's as good a way as any to
dialog: describe it. I've seen far worse
dialog: cases. You might even learn to
dialog: enjoy these walks down memory lane.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: But the rest of it? The killing
dialog: headaches. The phantom smells. My
dialog: inability to close my eyes without
text: thinking a hundred things at once.
dialog: It's all nothing more than bad
dialog: electricity?
speaker_heading: DR. PAYNE
dialog: In a manner of speaking. I've
dialog: never encountered the olfactory
dialog: hallucinations, but I'm sure
dialog: they're related.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: So what do I do?
speaker_heading: DR. PAYNE
dialog: Take the Luminal to sleep, or
dialog: whenever you feel an attack coming
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You seem to be saying that this
dialog: isn't just a case of resting until
dialog: I'm better. That my condition will
dialog: continue to deteriorate until the
dialog: end of my life.
text: The doctor responds with a sympathetic gaze. Whale nods
text: solemnly.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Whale makes his way toward the stairs. He passes a
text: stoop-shouldered ELDERLY WOMAN who leans on the arm of her
text: middle-aged DAUGHTER. Then an OLD MAN in a wheelchair, his
text: eyes brimming with bewilderment and despair.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY
text: Hanna opens the door. Clay wears dungarees and a white
text: dress shirt.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Don't worry, you already paid me.
dialog: I'm here because --
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: The Master is waiting for you.
text: She gestures him in, shuts the door.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Clay follows Hanna into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: HANNA
text: He's down in his studio. Here.
dialog: Take this with you.
text: She thrusts a TV tray toward him. Two glasses, two bottles
text: of beer, a bottle of Coke.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It's your job, lady, not mine.
dialog: (hands back the tray)
dialog: I'm here so he can draw my picture.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I'm keeping away. What you are
dialog: doing is no business of mine.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What're you talking about?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What kind of man are you? Are you
dialog: a good man?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Yeah, I'm a good man. Something
dialog: make you think I'm not?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You will not hurt him?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Gimme a break. I'm going to sit on
dialog: my ass while he draws pictures. Is
dialog: that going to hurt him?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. No.
dialog: (closes her eyes)
dialog: I am sorry. Forget everything I
dialog: say. Here. I will take the tray.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You do that.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
text: Clay opens the squeaking door and enters behind Hanna.
text: Whale stands at a drafting table, sharpening a pencil.
text: Hanna sets the tray down.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Very good, Hanna. Now goodbye.
text: She goes toward the door, wrinkling her forehead at Clay.
text: The screen door bangs shut.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'm sure you'd like something to
dialog: wet your whistle while I work.
text: Whale opens a bottle of beer, pours it into a glass, hands
text: it to Clay. He gestures to a chair.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: We'll go slowly today. Since this
dialog: is your first time as a model.
text: Clay sits. He pulls a "TV Guide" out of his back pocket.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Did you see this? They're showing
dialog: one of your movies tomorrow night.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You don't say? Which picture?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: "Bride of Frankenstein."
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Hmmm. I much prefer "Show Boat" or
dialog: "The Invisible Man." Shall we
dialog: begin?
text: Clay takes a swig of beer and sets the glass on the floor.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Ready when you are.
text: Whale stares at Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: That shirt, Mr. Boone.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It's new.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'm sorry. It's too white, too
dialog: distracting. Would it be asking
dialog: too much for you to take it off?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm not wearing an undershirt.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Pish posh, Mr. Boone. I'm not your
dialog: Aunt Tilly.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: But it's just my face you want to
dialog: draw.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh if it's going to make you
dialog: uncomfortable...
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Perhaps we can find something else
dialog: for you to wear.
text: He lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker, revealing a stack
text: of "Physique" magazines. Whale casually covers them with a
dialog: newspaper.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: We could wrap this like a toga
dialog: around your shoulders. Would that
dialog: help you overcome your schoolgirl
dialog: shyness?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: All right already. I'll take it
dialog: off. Kind of warm in here anyway.
text: He unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Yes. Much better.
dialog: (steps forward)
dialog: Here.
text: Clay adjusts his belt buckle as Whale hangs the shirt on a
text: wall peg. He moves back to the easel again.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I think we'll have you sit slightly
dialog: sideways, so you can rest one arm
text: on the back of the chair. Yes.
dialog: Just so.
text: The arm with the tattoo faces the easel. Clay smirks.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Take a picture, it lasts longer.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: That's exactly what I intend to do.
text: A clatter of pencils in the easel's tray, followed by a
text: moment of silence. Finally, a low, whistly scratch. Clay
text: concentrates on keeping still, focusing on an open window.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You seem to have no idea how
dialog: handsome you are, Mr. Boone. It
dialog: has to do with how snugly your face
dialog: fits your skull.
text: Clay wipes a thin line of sweat from his waist.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Would you be more comfortable
dialog: barefoot? Feel free to remove your
text: boots and socks.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It's a bit like being at the
dialog: doctor, isn't it? You have to
dialog: remain perfectly still while I
dialog: examine and scrutinize you.
text: Whale suddenly sniffs, as if smelling something. He sniffs
text: several times more but continues to draw.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Dripping?
dialog: (to Clay)
dialog: Do you ever eat dripping in this
dialog: country? The fat from roasts and
text: such, congealed in jars. Used like
text: butter on bread.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Sounds like something you feed the
dialog: dog.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It is. Only the poorest families
dialog: ever ate it. We kept ours in a
text: crockery jar.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Your family ate dripping?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (catching himself)
dialog: Of course not. As I said, only
dialog: poor people --
text: Whale stops. He lets out a bitter laugh.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'm sorry. I've just realized how
dialog: terribly ironic it all is.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I've spent most of my life
dialog: outrunning my past. Now it's
dialog: flooding all over me.
text: Clay stares out blankly.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: There's something about the
dialog: openness of your face that makes me
dialog: want to speak the truth. Yes, my
text: family ate dripping. Beef dripping
text: and four to a bed, and a privy out
dialog: back in the alley. Are you also
dialog: from the slums, Mr. Boone?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: We weren't rich. But we weren't
dialog: poor either.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No, you were middle class, like all
dialog: Americans.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I guess you'd say we lived on the
text: wrong side of the tracks.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: In Dudley there were more sides of
dialog: the tracks than any American can
dialog: imagine. Every Englishman knows
dialog: his place. And if you forget,
dialog: there's always someone to remind
dialog: you. My family had no doubts about
dialog: who they were. But I was an
dialog: aberration in that household a
dialog: freak of nature. I had imagination,
dialog: cleverness, joy. Where did I get
dialog: that? Certainly not from them.
text: Whale's voice has changed, becoming more pinched and nasal.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: They took me out of school when I
dialog: was fourteen and put me in a
dialog: factory. They meant no harm. They
dialog: were like a family of farmers
dialog: who've been given a giraffe, and
dialog: don't know what to do with the
dialog: creature except harness him to the
dialog: plow.
text: Whale seems completely lost in the past by now.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Hatred was the only thing that kept
dialog: my soul alive in that soul-killing
dialog: place. And among those men I hated
dialog: was my own poor, dumb father. Who
dialog: put me in that hell to begin with.
text: Whale peers out from behind the square of paper. He pales
text: when he sees his father William, his face covered with
text: grime, glaring at him from across the room. Whale retreats
text: behind the pad, takes a breath.
speaker_heading: CLAY (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Whale?
text: Relief floods Whale's face. He looks out, smiles at Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone.
dialog: Since my stroke, I am often
text: overcome with nostalgia.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I don't mind. I'm not crazy about
dialog: my old man either.
text: Whale rubs a hand across his eyes and steps into the open.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Why don't we break for five
dialog: minutes? You probably want to
dialog: stretch your legs.
text: Whale pulls the cover sheet over the pad to hide what he's
dialog: drawn so far.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT (V.O.)
dialog: So you just sat there while this
dialog: old limey banged his gums?
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT
text: The place is dead. There's only Clay and Dwight sitting at
text: the bar with the owner, HARRY, a balding hep cat with a
text: scraggly tuft of beard. And, in a booth, KID SAYLOR, a
text: cocky 20-year-old, necking with a pony-tailed TEENAGER.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I liked it. You learn stuff
text: listening to old-timers.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Can't say that I have. Can't say
dialog: I've heard of a lot of people
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: If you don't believe me, let's
dialog: watch this movie. See if his
dialog: name's on it. How about it, Harry?
dialog: Can I watch my damn movie?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I told you. I don't turn on the TV
dialog: except for the fights.
text: BETTY CARTWRIGHT appears behind the bar, lugging a bucket of
text: ice from the storeroom. She's an attractive woman in her
text: early 30s, big-boned and almost as tall as Clay.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: A spooky movie. Just what this
dialog: place needs tonight.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Couldn't make it any deader, doll.
dialog: Set me up.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sure. Your friend want one?
text: Clay reacts to the silent treatment with a tight smile.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Yeah, one for what's-his-name here.
text: She sets down two bottles of Pabst without looking at Clay.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Thanks, doll.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: I say let loverboy watch his
dialog: movie. And be grateful Boone's
text: not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Why is everybody giving me crap
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Jesus, Boone. You come in here
dialog: proud as a peacock because some old
dialog: coot wants to paint your picture.
dialog: We're just bringing you back to
dialog: earth.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sounds screwy to me. I can't
dialog: imagine a real artist wanting to
text: spend time looking at that kisser.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: This kisser wasn't so bad you
dialog: couldn't lay under it a few times.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Ooooh.
text: Betty glares at Clay, who realizes he's gone too far.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I bet this is just some fruit
dialog: pretending to be famous. So he can
dialog: get in the big guy's pants.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Ooooh.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What makes you say that?
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: Just thinking out loud.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Yeah, well keep your filthy
dialog: thoughts to yourself.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: All right, then. He's interested
dialog: in you for your conversation. We
dialog: know what a great talker you are.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Not anymore you don't. Doll.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (explodes)
dialog: We're watching the movie, Harry.
dialog: You got that! We are watching my
dialog: fucking movie.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Calm down, Clay. Just calm down.
dialog: We'll watch it.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Good. Fine.
text: Harry reaches up, turns on a battered Motorola. On the tv,
text: a voice announces: "Tonight, Boris Karloff in 'The Bride of
text: Frankenstein.'" The titles come on. Ending with the phrase
text: "Directed by", which floats over a white blob. The blob
text: jumps forward to form letters: "James Whale."
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Right there. What did I tell you?
dialog: James Whale.
text: The movie starts. The Monster being roasted alive in the
text: flaming wreckage of a mill.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: This looks corny.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Go wash glasses if you don't like
dialog: it.
text: In a flooded crater under the mill, the Monster kills an old
text: man. He climbs up, flips the man's wife into the pit below.
text: An owl blinks impassively.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Not bad. Two down and it's just
dialog: started.
text: Minnie, a hatchet-faced woman with fluttering ribbons, is
text: now alone with the Monster.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale and Hanna are in bathrobes and slippers, and there is
text: a glass of milk and a plate of cookies on Whale's TV tray.
text: On the tv, Minnie (played by UNA O'CONNOR) squeaks and
text: whimpers and screams. Whale laughs.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Wonderful old Una. Gobbling like
text: an old turkey hen.
text: But Hanna isn't amused. She unclenches her arms to close
text: the bathrobe over her throat.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Oh, that monster. How could you be
dialog: working with him?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Don't be silly, Hanna. He's a very
dialog: proper actor. And the dullest
dialog: fellow imaginable.
text: Minnie flees in a bowlegged jig up the hill. Whale smiles
dialog: again.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT
text: On the tv, Dr. Pretorius (played by Ernest Thesiger)
text: delivers a toast with inimitably ripe enunciation: "To a
text: new world of gods and monsters!" Dwight and Harry and
text: Betty all laugh.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: These old movies are such a hoot.
dialog: They thought they were being scary,
dialog: but they're just funny.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (defensively)
dialog: Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Funny is funny and scary is scary.
dialog: You don't mix them.
text: Suddenly the tinny tv soundtrack is drowned out by the voice
text: of Elvis Presley. Kid Saylor bends over the jukebox,
text: wagging his denim butt and tapping a high-top sneaker.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Hey! Some of us are watching a
dialog: movie!
speaker_heading: SAYLOR
dialog: Go ahead. Free country.
text: Clay jumps from his stool. Saylor sees him coming, steps
dialog: aside.
speaker_heading: SAYLOR
dialog: You want me to turn it down?
text: Clay slams the heel of his hand against Saylor's chest. The
text: boy staggers backward. Clay grabs the corner of the jukebox
text: and jerks it from the wall; the needle scratches across the
text: song. Saylor holds up both hands in a nervous surrender.
speaker_heading: SAYLOR
dialog: Hey, I didn't know. It's your
dialog: favorite movie. Sorry, okay?
text: Clay returns to the bar and uprights the stool. Saylor
text: escorts his girl to the door.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You're like a dog with a bone over
dialog: this movie, Clay.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I just want to watch it, okay?
text: On the tv, the blind man thanks God for sending him a
dialog: friend.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Hanna's frown pops open.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: He is not going to kill the old
dialog: man?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No, Hanna. My heart isn't that
dialog: black.
text: In a crypt, the Monster meets Dr. Pretorius, who is having a
text: midnight snack on top of a closed coffin. "Friend?" the
text: monster asks. "Yes, I hope so," answers Pretorius, without
text: batting an eyelash. He offers the Monster a drink, then
dialog: adds: "Have a cigar. They're my only weakness."
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: The cigars were my own brand. So
dialog: that I could have the leftovers.
text: On the tv, the Monster groans: "Love dead. Hate living."
text: Whale's focus sharpens, prompted by the unexpected
dialog: discussion of death.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT
text: The Monster holds a skull in both hands and happily
text: growls, "Wiiife." Betty, shudders, for real this time.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sick stuff. Necrophilia. I wonder
dialog: if they knew how sick they were.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: The Monster's lonely and he wants a
dialog: friend, a girlfriend, somebody.
dialog: What sick about that?
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dr. Frankenstein and Pretorius make their final
text: preparations. Frankenstein inquires where the fresh heart
dialog: came from. "There are always accidental deaths occurring,"
text: Pretorius replies. "Always." Once again, Whale responds to
dialog: the talk of death.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT
text: Finally, the Bride comes to life. She looks up, down, left,
text: right, uncertain who she is. The Monster stares
text: tenderly. "Friend?" He timidly touches her arm and she
text: screams.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: All right! You don't want him.
text: The Monster is heartbroken. Nobody loves him, not even his
dialog: Bride.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The Bride shrieks again.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: She is horrible.
speaker_heading: WHALE
text: She is beautiful.
text: The Monster's pain turns to anger. He tears through the
text: lab, orders Frankenstein to escape with his wife. But he
dialog: wants Pretorius and the Bride to stay. "We belong dead."
text: Whale reacts sharply to the line.
text: The Monster blows up the laboratory and the movie ends.
text: Hanna shivers as she stands.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Ugh. I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy, but
dialog: your movie is not my teacup.
dialog: Still, I am glad there is a happy
text: ending. The bad people are dead
dialog: and the good people live.
text: She hits the button on the Magnavox with the flat of her
dialog: palm.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT
text: Betty turns off the Motorola.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Weird movie. Weird, weird, weird.
text: Harry stands up and stretches. Clay remains seated.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: So what did you think?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Weird.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: I loved it. I want a switch like
dialog: that in my trailer, so I can blow
dialog: us to kingdom come when things
dialog: don't go my way.
text: He wobbles when he climbs off his stool.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Damn but it's getting drunk in
dialog: here. Late too. The bride of
dialog: Dwight is going to bite my head
dialog: off.
text: He tilts toward the door.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: You coming, Boone?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I think I'll hang around.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Go home, Clay. We're closing up.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I thought I'd give you a hand since
dialog: I kept you open.
text: He waits to see how Betty reacts. She shrugs. Harry takes
text: his book and cash drawer to the back door.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm next door if you need me.
text: He gives Clay one last look and goes out to the breezeway
text: and his apartment.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You know what? I think you guys
dialog: are all jealous.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What's to be jealous of?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I've gotten to know someone who's
dialog: famous.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Not so famous any of us have ever
dialog: heard of him.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: If he were that famous, he probably
dialog: wouldn't give me the time of day.
dialog: This way, he's like my famous
dialog: person.
dialog: (laughs at himself)
dialog: Yeah, my own personal famous
dialog: person. Who treats me like I'm
dialog: somebody worth talking to.
text: Clay leans down to plug in the jukebox.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You want to go for a swim?
text: She snaps her mouth open and imitates the Bride's
text: furious cat hiss.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What's that mean?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: It means it's too cold to go
dialog: swimming. And I don't mean the
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I wasn't going to try anything.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke
text: another cigarette.
text: He patiently waits by the door while Betty turns out the
text: lights. She walks briskly through the glow of the jukebox,
text: waving Clay outside with her hand.
scene_heading: EXT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT
text: Betty pulls the door shut and bends over to lock it. Clay
text: catches a glimpse of skin in the side slit of her shirttail.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Let's go for a walk at least. Walk
dialog: and talk. I really feel like
dialog: talking tonight.
text: Betty's eyes blink in mock surprise.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: This old guy -- he's the kind of
dialog: person I expected to meet when I
dialog: moved out here. Someone who's done
dialog: things with his life.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Do you realize you're more
dialog: interested in this old goober than
dialog: you ever were in me?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It's different. He's a man. And
dialog: by the way you have no business
dialog: calling him a homo.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: It never crossed your mind?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: He's an artist. Anyway, he's too
dialog: old to think about sex.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: All the old men I know think about
dialog: nothing but sex.
text: She opens the door of her Chevy. Clay grabs it with both
text: hands to keep her from getting in.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: C'mon. What's eating you tonight?
text: Betty hesitates, then looks him sharply in the eye.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You picked up that girl right in
text: front of me.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Hey, no strings, right? That's
dialog: what you always said. Just good
dialog: pals who have the hots for each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: It still hurt. A lot.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I didn't mean to...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: No, I'm actually kind of glad it
dialog: happened. It made me wonder what
dialog: the hell I was doing with my life.
dialog: Letting you pull me into bed
dialog: whenever the spirit moved you.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You liked it too.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sure. I loved it.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: If you enjoy it, you should do it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: You know, I just can't do that
dialog: anymore. I still have time to get
dialog: things right. Get married again --
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You mean us?
text: Betty bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: The look on your face! You're not
dialog: marriage material. You're not even
dialog: boyfriend material. You're a kid.
text: A big, fun, slightly irresponsible
dialog: kid.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm not a kid.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What are you then? What will you
dialog: be ten years from now? Still
dialog: cutting lawns? Still banging horny
dialog: divorcees in your trailer?
text: Clay glares at her, his jaw working forward in anger.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I like my life. I'm a free man.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Sure you're free, for now at least.
dialog: But how long before you're just
dialog: alone? Pathetic and alone.
text: Clay's anger jumps from his jaw into his shoulders and arms.
text: He grabs the door handle.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: So you don't want to fuck. That's
dialog: what you're telling me?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Is that all this conversation means
dialog: to you? Am I going to put out or
dialog: not?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Damn straight. I'm sick of playing
dialog: games.
text: Betty quickly gets into the car. before she can pull the
text: door shut, Clay slams it on her, hard. Her hands leap in
text: front of her face, as if he'd hit her. The look of fear in
text: her eyes startles Clay out of his rage.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Betty, look. This is coming out
dialog: all wrong --
text: She frantically turns the key in the ignition and the Chevy
text: pulls out.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: From here on out, Boone, you're
text: just another tired old face on the
text: other side of the bar.
text: The car screeches away. Clay stumbles across the highway.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT
text: Clay comes to the dump at the end of the canyon. He climbs
text: into it, kicking at loose cans.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It's all shit! Shit on by women!
dialog: Shit on by the Marines. Shit on by
dialog: the world! Fuck!
text: He shouts the word at the cliff, for the raw, sudden
text: violence of shouting.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Fuuuck!
text: A dog in the carport starts to bark. The sound of Clay's
text: pain echoes off the canyon as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale is sitting up n bed when Hanna knocks. She enters
text: with a tray loaded with bottles and vials.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Good night.
text: Whale takes the pills, one by one, until he comes to the
text: bottle of Luminal. He opens the pheno bottle to shake out a
text: capsule and a dozen spill into his palm. He stares at them.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Hanna opens the door, gasps when she sees Whale lying
text: motionless on the bed. She spots the empty bottle of
dialog: Luminal.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Oh no, Mr. Jimmy.
text: Hanna kneels next to the body. She makes a Sign on the
text: Cross, launches into a frantic "Hail Mary." We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale snorts at the imagined scene. One by one, he returns
text: the capsules to their bottle, until a single pill remains.
text: He places it on the table, then turns out the lamp and lies
text: on his back in the dark, waiting for sleep.
text: The distant sound of laughter invades the darkness. Whale
text: sits up, straining to identify the voices. The bedroom wall
text: opposite him melts away, revealing:
scene_heading: INT. SPECIAL MAKEUP TRAILER - UNIVERSAL STUDIOS - DAY (1935)
text: ELSA LANCHESTER and BORIS KARLOFF sit side by side in
text: dentist chairs, cloths around their necks, heads tilted
text: back. JACK PIERCE, the makeup artist, is patting the hair
text: drawn over a cage on Elsa's head. He looks up, sees Whale,
text: and breaks into a conspiratorial grin. Elsa's eyes are
text: closed; she hasn't heard whale enter.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: You done yet, love? I am
text: absolutely dying for a fag.
text: Whale tiptoes in for a better look. Karloff has a
text: mouthpiece to help him breathe while the assistant adds
text: another coat of green sizing to the still incomplete
dialog: makeup.
speaker_heading: BORIS KARLOFF
dialog: (gurgles)
dialog: Goo' 'orning, 'ames.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Good morning. And a very good
dialog: morning to you.
text: Elsa's eyes snap open. There are no mirrors on the walls.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: Uh-oh. The way you look at me,
dialog: James. What have you done this
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Bring a mirror. Let the Bride
text: feast upon her visage.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: Boris? Do I look a fright?
text: Karloff shrugs, irked that she's getting all the attention.
text: Jack Pierce lifts a large mirror.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (nasal New Yorkese)
dialog: Behold, the Bride of Frankenstein.
text: Elsa stares at the beautiful corpse in the mirror. She
text: snaps her head left, right, up, down, startled by the sight
text: of herself, electrocuted into frightened, spastic jerks.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: Oh, James.
text: As Whale observes his star we see her spasms through his
text: eyes -- as a series of dissonant, line-jumping close-ups.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: And you said there'd be some of me
dialog: left. Nobody's going to know me in
dialog: this getup.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Nonsense, my dear. You look
dialog: extraordinary.
dialog: (to an assistant)
dialog: Today's script. Quick. And a
dialog: pencil.
text: Whale scans the page of shooting script, the margin marked
text: in pencil: CU, MS, MLS. Whale pencils in a bracket and
scene_heading: scribbles: CU a,b,c,d---MOS.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Jack, I want to get on this right
dialog: away. Sorry, Boris, we won't get
dialog: to you until this afternoon.
speaker_heading: BORIS KARLOFF
dialog: I 'ish you 'old 'e 'ooner.
text: The assistant removes his mouthpiece.
speaker_heading: BORIS KARLOFF
dialog: I could have spent the morning
dialog: tending to my roses.
scene_heading: INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
text: The interior of Stage C is completely filled by the
text: laboratory set. Electricians adjust the lights on the
text: wooden tower beside the Bride's table. COLIN CLIVE (Dr.
text: Frankenstein) and ERNEST THESIGER (Dr. Pretorius) sit off to
text: the side, in full makeup and costume. Clive mumbles
text: earnestly over his script. Thesiger pinches his face over
text: the needle he dips in and out of an embroidery ring.
text: Whale comes on the set with Elsa on his arm. She walks
text: regally beside him, the train of her long white robe thrown
text: over one arm. There's a wolf whistle from overhead, and
text: applause, causing Elsa to curtsy to her admirers. Thesiger
text: takes her hand, leans back to study her.
speaker_heading: ERNEST THESIGER
dialog: My God. Is the audience to presume
dialog: that Colin and I have done her
dialog: hair? I thought we were mad
dialog: scientists, not hairdressers.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: Only a mad scientist could do this
text: to a woman.
speaker_heading: ERNEST THESIGER
dialog: Oh no, my dear. You look
dialog: absolutely amazing. There's no way
dialog: I can compete with you. The scene
dialog: is yours.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
text: In the sequel, James, two lady
dialog: scientists should make a monster.
dialog: And our monster would be Gary
dialog: Cooper.
speaker_heading: ERNEST THESIGER
dialog: I would've thought Mr. Leslie
dialog: Howard would be more your line.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: More your line.
speaker_heading: ERNEST THESIGER
dialog: My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin
dialog: Tin. Dogs are so much more
dialog: dependable than men.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Colin? Please. It's time.
dialog: (softly, to Thesiger)
dialog: How is he today?
speaker_heading: ERNEST THESIGER
text: Stiff as a board.
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Yes, Colin. Come see what they've
dialog: done to our Elsa.
text: Clive walks over, glumly.
speaker_heading: COLIN CLIVE
dialog: I'm not at my best today, Jimmy.
dialog: A touch of flu, you know.
text: Whale sees through the excuse, rests an arm on Clive's
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Relax, my boy. You could do this
dialog: scene in your sleep.
text: Clive grits his teeth and nods. Whale positions them in
text: front of the upended table, Clive and Thesiger holding
text: Elsa's robe out by the hems. The shadow of the sound boom
text: passes back and forth while they rehearse.
speaker_heading: ERNEST THESIGER
dialog: I gather we not only did her hair
dialog: but dressed her. What a couple of
dialog: queens we are, Colin.
text: Elsa giggles. Clive looks distraught -- which brings some
text: life to his stiffness. Whale sees this, decides to tune it
dialog: higher.
speaker_heading: WHALE
text: Yes, a couple of flaming queens.
dialog: And Pretorius is a little in love
dialog: with Dr. Frankenstein, you know.
text: Clive's distress reads clearly now. He is twitchy and
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Yes. I think it's coming together.
dialog: Shall we have a go?
text: He sits in the canvas director's chair, nods to the
dialog: assistant director.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: Quiet on the set!
text: The warning bell rings.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: Lights!
text: The lights sizzle and blaze.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: Sound!
speaker_heading: SOUND MAN
dialog: Okay for sound.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: Camera!
text: A young man with a clapboard steps in front of the camera.
speaker_heading: CAMERA ASSISTANT
dialog: Scene two-fifteen. Take one.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Action.
text: The Bride snaps her head in various directions. Thesiger
text: slopes back, fingers splayed, intoxicated by his creation:
speaker_heading: ERNEST THESIGER
dialog: The Bride of Frankenstein!
text: Whale sits with his legs crossed, jogging his raised foot as
text: if conducting the scene with his show. Fully engaged,
text: intensely alive. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale glances at the clock, sees that it is 3:15. He is
text: wide awake. He reaches over, picks up the Luminal.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Luminal. Illumine all.
text: Whale reluctantly places the pill on his tongue and
text: swallows. He rests his head on the pillow and stares at the
text: ceiling, where the reflection of the window sheers casts an
text: ever-shifting pattern of light and dark. We move down to
dialog: reveal:
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT (BLACK &amp; WHITE)
text: It's a cobblestone cell, a plaster set from "Bride of
text: Frankenstein." Whale sits in a massive chair, straining
text: against thick iron chains, as a lightning storm rages
text: outside. In the distance, heavy footsteps, coming closer,
text: until the cell door is filled with the silhouette of the
text: Monster. Whale hardly dares to breathe as the Monster rips
text: off the door and enters the cell.
text: The Monster steps into the light, allowing us to see his
text: face for the first time. It is Clay Boone, dressed in a
text: Marine parade uniform. He uses his hedge clippers to cut
text: the chains from around Whale's chest.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Thank you. Thank you so much.
text: Clay leans down and takes Whale in his arms, cradling him
text: like a child. They move across the sound stage -- Clay
text: carefully sidestepping the lights and cables on the floor --
text: until they reach the next set:
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
text: Clay carries Whale past a painted backdrop of a stormy
dialog: English countryside.
scene_heading: INT. FRANKENSTEIN'S LAB - NIGHT
text: Whale lies on the Bride's table. Clay pulls on a doctor's
text: smock, picks up a scalpel from a table covered with various
text: medical instruments. he carves a thin circle around the top
text: of Whale's forehead. Then, with one deft movement, he pops
text: off Whale's scalp and pulls out the brain. It is
text: soot-covered, charred, used up.
text: Whale watches with detached fascination as Clay tosses it on
text: the floor, then takes a throbbing, luminous mass from a
dialog: tray.
text: Clay inserts the new brain into Whale's skull, sutures the
text: scalp back into place. he fastens the conducting clamps
text: around Whale's temples, then throws the heavy circuit
text: breaker. Lights throb with bursts of energy...loose sparks
text: crackle...rotary sparks create snapping circles of fire...as
text: the energy of the raging storm is harnessed into the
dialog: machinery.
text: Clay steps back to take in his handiwork. A sudden look of
text: panic fills Whale's face.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It isn't working. The experiment
dialog: is a failure.
text: Clay glances down at Whale, whose breathing is slowing.
text: Realizing that the new brain hasn't taken:
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Just go to sleep.
text: A serenity suffuses Whale's features as he stares up at the
text: pale flicker of lightning. His breathing finally stops, his
text: face a tranquil mask of death. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Whale wakes with a start. He checks the clock, sees that
text: it's past nine. He presses an intercom button on the
dialog: bedside table.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'm up, Hanna.
text: Whale sits up, drinks in the sunlight. He notices some
text: grass clippings and leaves scattered on the bedspread.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What in God's name --
text: Whale turns and sees Clay lying next to him. He gasps.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: I told you to sleep.
text: Clay's hands close around Whale's neck. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Whale opens his eyes groggily. He scans the room in panic,
text: clearly unable to get his bearings.
text: Whale tries to stand but his legs give way beneath him.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY (LATER)
text: Whale and Hanna stare straight out as she reaches down and
text: unbuttons the tiny buttons on his pajama fly. Whale
text: supports himself with one hand on Hanna's shoulder as he
text: relieves himself with the other.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY (LATER)
text: Whale sits up in bed, staring dumbly at the morning paper.
text: Hanna reaches in to take away the breakfast tray.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Does the yardman come today?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Of course. This afternoon.
text: A thin smile forms on Whale's face.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Clay prunes the roses on the front lawn. Hanna appears,
dialog: frowning.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Something I can do for you?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: The Master wants to know if you are
dialog: free for lunch. I tell him you
dialog: will be having other plans, but he
dialog: insists I ask.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm
dialog: free until then.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Expect nothing fancy.
text: Hanna goes inside. Clay rolls the mower down the path.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Clay knocks on the bottom of the Dutch door as he lifts the
text: latch and walks in. He is wearing a fresh madras shirt.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: The Master is dressing. I am to
dialog: offer you a drink. There is
text: whiskey and there is iced tea.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Tea is fine.
text: He sits at the kitchen table.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. You are a guest now. You go
text: in the living room.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: That's okay, Hanna. I'm more
dialog: comfortable in here. It is Hanna,
dialog: isn't it?
text: She eyes him suspiciously, shrugs, pours a glass of tea.
text: Clay notices a Bible on the counter.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Long enough. Fifteen years.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I bet you've seen a lot of famous
dialog: people come and go? Movie stars?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and
dialog: I. People come to play bridge.
dialog: And now and then, young men to
dialog: swim. You have people, Boone?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You mean family? All in Joplin,
dialog: Missouri.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Your wife?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm not married.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Oh, I don't know. Because no girl
dialog: in her right mind will have me?
speaker_heading: HANNA
text: A man who is not married has
text: nothing. He is a man of trouble.
dialog: You need a woman.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You proposing what I think you're
dialog: proposing? Don't you think I'm a
dialog: little young for you?
text: Hanna twists her head around with such an indignant look
text: that Clay bursts out laughing. She realizes that she is
text: being teased.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Men. Always pulling legs.
dialog: Everything is comedy.
dialog: (mimics an English
dialog: accent)
dialog: "How very amusing. How marvelously
dialog: droll."
text: Hanna stares at Clay until his smile fades. She resumes her
text: chopping in silence.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You ever been married, Hanna?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Of course. I am married still.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Yeah? What's your husband do?
speaker_heading: HANNA
text: He is dead now, twenty years.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Then you're as single as I am.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. I have children, grandchildren
dialog: too. I visit when I can. But now
dialog: that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very
dialog: long, I do not get away much.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Poor Mr. Jimmy. There is much good
dialog: in him, but he will suffer the
dialog: fires of hell. Very sad.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You're sure of that?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: This is what the priests tell me.
dialog: His sins of the flesh will keep him
dialog: from heaven.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Sins of the flesh? Everybody has
dialog: those.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. His is the worse.
dialog: (worse)
dialog: The unspeakable. The deed no man
dialog: can name without shame?
text: She loses patience with Clay's blank look.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What is the good English? All I
dialog: know is bugger. He is a bugger.
text: Men who bugger each other.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: A homo?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes! You know?
text: Clay slowly sits up.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: That is why he must go to hell. I
dialog: do not think it fair. But God's
dialog: law is not for us to judge.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You're telling me Mr. Whale is a
dialog: homo.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You did not know?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Well...no, not really --
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You and he are not doing things?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Good. That is what I hope. I did
dialog: not think you a bugger too. I fear
dialog: only that you might hurt him if he
dialog: tries.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm not going to hurt anyone.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Yes. I trust you.
text: Off in the distance, a throat loudly trumpets itself clear.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You must go in. Quickly. He will
dialog: not like to think I have had you in
dialog: the kitchen.
text: Clay gets up slowly, reluctant to leave the room.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Whale comes forward as Clay enters, offering a hand at the
text: end of a spindly wrist.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: How are you, Mr. Boone? So glad
dialog: you are free for lunch.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: All right, I guess.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I assume you worked up an appetite
dialog: with your labor.
text: A hesitant smile from Clay. Whale picks a stack of mail off
text: the table, rifles through envelopes.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Forgive my rudeness. At my age,
dialog: the post is the cream of the day.
text: He returns the stack to the table but holds on to a square
dialog: envelope.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Do you mind?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Go ahead.
text: Clay looks off while Whale opens the envelope.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Hmmm? Princess Margaret?
text: He is examining a folded card. He rubs a thumb over the
text: printed lettering.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Her Majesty's Loyal Subjects in the
dialog: Motion Picture Industry...
dialog: Cordially invited...Reception at
dialog: the home of...Mr. George Cukor!
text: His lips smack open in disgust.
speaker_heading: WHALE
text: That pushy little -- horning in on
text: the Queen's sister, then offering
dialog: to share her with the whole damn
dialog: raj? I live in this country to get
dialog: away from this rubbish!
text: He tosses the invitation on the table.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Is this David's doing?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: This David's a friend?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Yes. An old, useless friend. You
dialog: must excuse me, Mr. Boone. This is
dialog: a world I finished with long ago.
dialog: I pay them no mind and expect them
dialog: to return the compliment.
dialog: (a deep breath)
dialog: Lunch should be ready. Shall we?
text: He holds out an open hand so that Clay can precede him into
text: the dining room.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Hanna sets down two steaming plates of omelettes. Whale
text: hands a glass of red wine to Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Cheers.
text: They both take a sip of wine.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Smells lovely, Hanna.
text: Hanna nods, steals a glance at Clay as she leaves.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Saw your movie the other night.
dialog: Watched it with some friends.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Did you now?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I liked it. We all did.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Did anyone laugh?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (covering)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Pity. People are so earnest
dialog: nowadays.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Why? Was it supposed to be funny?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Of course. I had to make it
dialog: interesting for myself, you see. A
dialog: comedy about death. The trick is
dialog: not to ruin it for anyone who isn't
text: in on the joke.
dialog: (a sip of wine)
dialog: But the Monster never receives any
dialog: of my gibes. He is noble. Noble
dialog: and misunderstood.
text: Whale gazes pointedly at Clay, who eats with his elbows on
text: the table, quickly bolting the hot omelette.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: In Korea, Mr. Boone?
text: Clay looks up.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Did you kill anyone?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I don't like to talk about that.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It's nothing to be ashamed of, in
dialog: the service of one's country.
dialog: That's something to be proud of.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Proud? Any jerk with a gun can
dialog: kill someone.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Quite true. Hand-to-hand combat is
dialog: the true test. Did you ever slay
dialog: anyone hand-to-hand?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: No. I could have, though.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Yes, I believe you could.
dialog: (a sip of wine)
dialog: How free is your schedule this
dialog: afternoon?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Full up. I got the hedges to do
text: here, then another lawn out by La
dialog: Cienega.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What is we say phooey to the
dialog: hedges? Could you spare an hour
dialog: after lunch? To sit for me?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Can't today.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'll pay our going rate. Plus what
dialog: you'd get if you did the hedges.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Sorry. I don't feel like sitting
dialog: still today.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: All righty. I understand.
text: Whale tilts a scrutinizing eye at Clay.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - PANTRY - DAY (LATER)
text: Hanna carries the dirty dishes back to the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Clay starts to bite the tip off a cigar.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Use this.
text: Whale passes him a gold penknife.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Just a trim. And mine while you're
text: at it. Fingers are a bit stiff
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No. At least not in the legal
dialog: sense.
text: Clay hands a clipped cigar back to Whale.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: So you had a wife?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Or a husband. Depending on which
dialog: of us you asked. My friend David.
dialog: He lived here for many years.
text: The other cigar crunches faintly between Clay's fingers.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Does that surprise you?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No, I -- you're a homosexual.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh dear. If one must have a
dialog: clinical name.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm not, you know.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I never thought you were.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You don't think of me that way, do
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What way might that be?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You know. Look at me like -- like
dialog: I look at women.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Don't be ridiculous. I know a real
dialog: man like you would break my neck if
dialog: I so much as laid a hand on him.
dialog: Besides, you're not my type.
text: Clay suddenly laughs. Whale's smile deepens.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: So we understand each other?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What you do is no business of mine.
dialog: Live and let live, I say.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I hope this has nothing to do with
dialog: your refusing to sit for me today?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No. I --
text: Whale continues to smile, slyly.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What are you afraid of, Mr. Boone?
dialog: Certainly not a frail old man like
dialog: me.
text: Clay has no answer. He gives in with a sigh.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
text: Clay sits sideways on the chair again. Whale stands at the
dialog: easel.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Can I see what you did so far?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It will only make you
dialog: self-conscious. You'll have to
dialog: remove your shirt.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Sorry. Not today.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: But we have to match the other
dialog: sketch.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I just feel more comfortable
dialog: keeping it on. You just said you
dialog: didn't want me self-conscious.
text: Whale steps forward.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Perhaps if we open the shirt and
dialog: pull --
text: Whale's hands to in. Clay's flesh tightens; he shrinks
text: back. The hands stop, palms raised.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh dear. I have made you
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm fine. I'd just rather keep it
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Suppose we unbutton the top and
dialog: pull it down around your shoulders?
dialog: Two buttons. Is that so much to
dialog: ask? Just two little buttons.
text: Whale's thumb and fingers unpluck buttons in midair.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No! Look. What you told me at
dialog: lunch is still very weird for me.
dialog: So either you sketch me like I am
dialog: or I'll say forget it and go do
dialog: your hedges.
text: Whale takes a step back. His eyes are locked on Clay,
text: fascinated by his temper.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I don't mean to be a prick, but
dialog: that's how I feel.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Of course. I don't want to scare
dialog: you off. Not before I'm finished
dialog: with you.
text: Whale glides behind the easel. The pencils rattle in the
dialog: tray.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Tell me more about yourself, Mr.
dialog: Boone. You have a steady
dialog: companion?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Not at the moment.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You know how it is. You have to
dialog: kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Very well put.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: The world is just one kiss-ass game
text: after another. A man has to make
text: up his own life, alone.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Ah. A philosopher.
speaker_heading: CLAY
text: Thoreau with a lawnmower.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I like that. But take care, Mr.
dialog: Boone. Freedom is a drug, much
dialog: like any other. Too much can be a
dialog: very bad thing.
text: Clay glances out the window. Feigning a merely casual
dialog: interest:
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Is that why you and your friend
dialog: split up? Because you wanted to be
dialog: free?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: In a way, yes. I suppose so. I
dialog: know it's why I stopped making
dialog: pictures.
text: Whale backs away from the easel and stares at the paper with
text: a sour frown.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You might not think it to look at
dialog: me now, but there was a time when I
dialog: was at the very pinnacle of my
dialog: profession. The horror movies were
dialog: behind me. I'd done "Show Boat."
dialog: Major success. Great box office.
dialog: Now I was to do something
dialog: important. "The Road Back." An
dialog: indictment of the Great War and
dialog: what it did to Germany. It was to
dialog: be my masterpiece.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: The fucking studio butchered it.
dialog: It was 1937, Hitler's armies were
text: already massing -- and still the
text: New York bankers stood in line to
dialog: curry his favor. Anything to avoid
dialog: losing the German market. They cut
dialog: away the guts and brought in
text: another director to add slapstick.
dialog: The picture laid an egg, a great
dialog: expensive bomb. For which I was
dialog: blamed.
text: A shadow passes over Whale's eyes. He presses two fingers
text: against his temple.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: After that, I went out of fashion.
dialog: I was no longer able to command
dialog: the best projects, so I walked
dialog: away. Why should I spend my time
dialog: working in such a dreadful business?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Do you miss it?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: It's so far in the past now. Over
dialog: fifteen years --
text: Whale stops himself. He smiles gently at Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Making movies was the most
dialog: wonderful thing in the world.
dialog: Working with friends.
dialog: Entertaining people. Yes, I
dialog: suppose I miss it. More so now
dialog: that --
text: Whale reaches into his pocket, takes out the bottle of
dialog: Luminal.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I think we all want to feel we've
dialog: left our mark on the world. Yes.
dialog: I wish I had done more work.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You've done a helluva lot more
dialog: than most people.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Better work.
text: Whale moves across the room to the screen door.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: But I chose freedom. David was
text: still in the thick of it, his life
text: full of anxiety and studio
dialog: intrigue. I didn't fancy spending
dialog: my golden years as merely "the
dialog: friend." The dirty little secret
text: of a nervous producer.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: How long were you...?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Twenty years. Too long. We were
dialog: like a play whose run outlasted the
dialog: cast's ability to keep it fresh.
dialog: So I finally decided to close down
dialog: the show.
text: Whale places a pill on his tongue and swallows. He fixes
text: Clay with a pinched smile.
speaker_heading: WHALE
text: When all fetters are loosened, a
dialog: certain hedonism creeps in, don't
dialog: you think? There was a period when
dialog: this house was overrun with young
dialog: men. Some even posed for me.
dialog: Right where you're sitting now.
text: Clay sits uncomfortably in his chair. His face flushes.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Of course, they weren't nearly as
dialog: bashful. No, this room was once
text: filled with bare buttocks. And
dialog: pricks. Hard, arrogant pricks --
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Cut it out!
text: Clay explodes out of his chair, knocking over a small side
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Fuck it. I can't do this anymore.
text: He looms over Whale, whose breathing starts to quicken.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Isn't it enough you told me you're
dialog: a fairy? Do you have to rub my
dialog: nose in it?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant
dialog: no --
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your
dialog: grass and that's it. Understand?
text: Before Whale can respond Clay storms out, nearly ripping the
text: screen door off its hinges. Whale sits on the daybed, takes
text: a few quick breaths. Suddenly the air is filled with the
text: sounds of people cavorting in the pool.
text: Whale looks up, sees a young man standing outside the screen
text: door. It is now dark outside.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Come on, Jimmy. Watch me dive.
text: Whale offers a melancholy smile.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I think I'll just rest for a
dialog: moment.
text: The man shrugs, disappears into the shadows. We move
text: across the room and through the door...
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Whale sits in a director's chair, a martini in one hand, a
text: cigar in the other, a harmless old uncle watching young men
text: swagger and splash in the pool.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I think we're ready to go.
text: He glances over, sees Clay in plaid bathing trunks, sitting
text: apart from the others. He is puffing on a Camel.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You're up, Mr. Boone.
text: Clay ignores him. Whale puts down his martini and cigar,
text: picks up a Polaroid camera. He moves over to clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
text: The extras are in their places.
dialog: Now we need the star. Wouldn't
dialog: you like to get in the pool?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You first.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh no. I never swim.
text: Whale removes Clay's cigarette, crushes it with his shoe.
text: Behind him, the pool is now a pit full of naked shadows.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You'll have to remove that shirt.
text: Whale touches Clay's bare chest. Clay grabs hold of his
text: wrist, causing the old man to yelp in pain. In the pool,
text: the extras shriek in alarm.
text: Clay's hands close tightly around Whale's throat.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Whale's hands fly to his throat. He opens his eyes and
text: gasps greedily for air, the young men's screams lingering
text: in the room. There is a look of genuine terror on his
dialog: face.
scene_heading: EXT. BRENTWOOD HOUSE - YARD - DUSK
text: The sun goes down. Clay wearily pushes his lawnmower,
text: struggling to concentrate on the darkened lawn.
scene_heading: EXT. BRENTWOOD HOUSE - BACK DOOR - NIGHT
text: The smug PROPERTY OWNER peers out at Clay from behind a
text: screen door.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Do you mind turning on a light?
dialog: It's getting pretty soupy out here.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Should have been here when you said
dialog: you would. You whack off a tow,
dialog: don't think about taking me to
dialog: court.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You're lucky I even squeezed you in
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Don't take that tone with me, bub.
dialog: There's Japs in this town that work
dialog: cheaper and do flowers too.
text: Clay takes a deep breath. He can't afford to get angry.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Will you just turn on the porch
dialog: light? Sir?
text: The owner flicks on the light.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT
text: Clay presses through the Saturday night crowd. Clay cranes
text: his neck to scan the crowd.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Where's Betty?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: She took the night off. Heavy
dialog: date. Some guy she's had her eye
text: on for a while.
text: Harry smiles pointedly at Clay, hands him the beer.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Thanks a lot, pal.
text: Clay turns his back on the bar. He sees Dwight moving
text: through the crowd.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Dwight!
text: Dwight nods, a little coolly.
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Hey, Boone.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Have a drink?
text: Dwight's WIFE, a pert, steely-eyed brunette, places a firm
text: hand on his shoulder. Dwight shrugs, heads toward the door.
text: Clay turns. A pretty, too-tan BLONDE WOMAN in her early 30s
text: is standing at the end of the bar, eyeing Clay. He lifts
text: his glass and she responds with an open smile.
scene_heading: EXT. CLAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT
text: Clay and the woman go at it, their shadows visible through
text: the glass louvers.
scene_heading: INT. CLAY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - DAY
text: Clay tugs on a cord and the harsh overhead fluorescent
text: buzzes to life. He splashes his face with water, then
text: catches his reflection in the mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MONICA LIBRARY - DAY
text: Clay parks outside the local branch of the public library.
scene_heading: INT. READING ROOM - DAY
text: Clay leafs through an oversized folio, bound copies of The
text: New York Times. He glances at an article from
text: 1936. "Interview With a Passing Whale." There is a picture
text: of Whale, captioned "Famous British Director." A LIBRARIAN
text: approaches with more leatherbound books.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: Here are the trade newspapers you
dialog: wanted.
text: Clay takes the books, opens one.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Whale eats lunch off a TV tray. His attention remains
text: focused on "Queen for a Day" as Hanna clomps into the room
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Who was that at the door?
speaker_heading: HANNA
text: A visitor.
text: Whale turns. His face registers surprise when he sees Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Thank you, Hanna. That will be
dialog: all.
text: Hanna retreats toward the kitchen. Clay steps tentatively
text: into the room.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Mr. Boone. You're not due to cut
text: the lawn until Wednesday.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'd like to sit for you again. But
dialog: only if you ease up on the locker
dialog: room talk. Okay?
text: Whale holds up two fingers, affects an American accent.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Scout's honor.
text: Clay smiles.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
text: Whale and Boone are back in their familiar positions. An
text: empty glass of beer sits on the floor next to Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'm curious, Mr. Boone. What
dialog: convinced you to come back?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I don't know. I guess I like your
dialog: stories.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Everybody has stories to tell.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Not me.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What about your stint in Korea?
dialog: I'm sure it was full of dramatic
dialog: episodes.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I told you. I don't like to talk
dialog: about that.
text: Whale nods, sensing that he's touched a sore spot.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: And the fear you showed at our last
dialog: session? How did you overcome
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: CLAY
text: Not fear. More like disgust.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Same difference, Mr. Boone.
text: Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all
dialog: part of the great gulf that stands
dialog: between us. Am I right in assuming
dialog: that you've had little experience
dialog: with men of my persuasion?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: There's no people like you in my
dialog: crowd.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No teammates in football? No
dialog: comrades in Korea?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You must think the whole world is
dialog: queer. Well it's not. War sure
dialog: isn't.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh, there may not be atheists in
dialog: the foxholes, but there are
dialog: occasionally lovers.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You're talking through your hat
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Not at all. I was in the foxholes
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You were a soldier?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I was an officer.
text: Clay breaks his pose to turn and look at Whale.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: This was World War I?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No, my dear. The Crimean War.
dialog: What do you think? The Great War.
dialog: You had a Good War, while we had --
text: Whale clears his throat, bored by his standard line.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: -- a war without end. There were
dialog: trenches when I arrived, and
dialog: trenches when I left, two years
dialog: later. Just like in the movies.
dialog: Only the movies never get the
dialog: stench of them. The world reduced
text: to mud and sandbags and a narrow
text: strip of rainy sky.
dialog: (a dry snort)
dialog: But we were discussing something
dialog: else. Oh yes. Love in the
dialog: trenches.
text: Now he's talking only to himself.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Barnett. Was that his name?
dialog: Leonard Barnett. He came to the
dialog: front straight from Harrow. And he
dialog: looked up to me. Unlike the
dialog: others, he didn't care that I was a
text: workingman impersonating his
dialog: betters. How strange, to be
dialog: admired so blindly. I suppose he
dialog: loved me. But chastely, like a
dialog: schoolboy.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Something happened to him?
text: Whale looks up at Clay, stares at him.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I remember one morning in
text: particular. A morning when the sun
dialog: came out.
scene_heading: EXT. TRENCHES - DAY (1917)
text: LEONARD BARNETT, 19, boyish and handsome, peers into a
text: periscope. Whale stands beside him, pointing out landmarks
text: on the bleak landscape.
speaker_heading: WHALE (V.O.)
dialog: Odd, how even there one could have
dialog: days when the weather was enough to
dialog: make one happy. He and I were
dialog: standing on the fire step and I
dialog: showed him the sights of no-man's
text: land, through the periscope. It
text: was beautiful. The barbed wire was
dialog: reddish gold, the water in the
text: shell holes green with algae, the
text: sky a clear quattrocento blue. And
text: I stood shoulder to shoulder with a
dialog: tall apple-cheeked boy who loved
dialog: and trusted me.
text: Whale reaches over and lays his arm across Barnett's
text: shoulder. Barnett smiles timidly at him. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
text: Whale leans forward, completely disoriented. His eyes fix
text: on Clay, the white eyebrows screwed down, until he is able
text: to recognize the face.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Don't do this to me again, Mr.
dialog: Boone. I absolutely refuse.
text: Whale stands, his legs shaky.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You will not set me on another walk
dialog: down memory lane. Not this lane.
dialog: Not today.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I didn't --
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Why do I tell you this? I never
dialog: told David. I never even
dialog: remembered it until you got me
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You're the one who started it.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You're very clever, Mr. Boone. You
dialog: just sit there and let me talk.
dialog: What a sorry old man, you're
dialog: thinking. What a crazy old poof.
dialog: (comes closer)
dialog: Why are you here? What do you want
dialog: from me?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You asked me to model. Remember?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Of course I remember. Do you think
dialog: I'm so senile --
text: Whale stands over Clay. His pale face turns left, right,
text: looking at Clay with one cold eye, then the other. Clay
text: returns the gaze, worried for Whale.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Mr. Whale? Are you okay?
text: Whale turns away. He yanks out a handkerchief.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Stupid. Very stupid. What have I
dialog: been thinking?
text: He sits on the daybed and bends over, covering both eyes
text: with the handkerchief.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Just go. Please. Why don't you
dialog: go?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I don't get it. First you creep me
dialog: out with homo shit. Then you hit
dialog: me with war stories. And now
dialog: you're upset because I listen?
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I want -- I want...
text: His pained eyes focus on Clay, and soften.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I want a glass of water.
text: Clay gets up and goes to the sink.
speaker_heading: WHALE
text: A touch of headache.
text: Clay hands him the water.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Thank you.
text: Whale sets the glass down and sits with his head lowered,
text: his body folded like a bundle of sticks.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: My apologies. I had no business
dialog: snapping at you.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No harm done.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It was foolishness to attempt this
dialog: portrait. You cannot force what
dialog: will not flow.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You don't want me to sit for you
dialog: anymore?
text: Whale shakes his head sadly. He gazes up at Clay, sees the
text: disappointment on his face.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: How would you like to come to a
dialog: party with me? A reception for
dialog: Princess Margaret.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I thought you weren't going.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: If you don't mind driving, I'd like
dialog: to take you as my guest. There
dialog: should be lots of pretty starlets
dialog: to keep you amused.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm game. Sure.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Very good, Clayton. May I call you
dialog: Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Clayton is fine.
text: Whale smiles gently.
scene_heading: EXT. OCEAN PROMENADE - DUSK
text: The sun is setting over the Pacific. Clay stands in a phone
text: booth on the strand.
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH - DUSK
text: Clay smiles anxiously as the call connects.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Mom? Yeah, it's me.
text: Clay pauses as his mother shoots questions at him.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No, I'm not in jail...I don't want
dialog: any money, no...
dialog: (louder, to be heard)
dialog: Look, is Sis there? I want to tell
dialog: her about this movie person I met
dialog: out here. She'll get a kick out of
dialog: it.
text: We hear the phrase: "She's out, Clay." Clay closes his eyes
text: as his mother rambles on.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No, I still...I'd give you my phone
dialog: number if I had a phone --
text: Clay tries to stay calm as his mother berates him for not
dialog: staying in touch.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: How's the old man?
text: Before Clay can protest we hear: "Hold on." Clay glances
text: out at couples strolling up the promenade. An operator
text: interrupts, says: "One dollar for the next three minutes."
text: Clay deposits two quarters before his mother returns.
dialog: "He's busy, Clay."
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Right.
text: The operator comes on again, asking for fifty more cents.
text: Clay stares at the quarters in his hand.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Time's up. I better go.
text: Clay listens as his mother prattles on, until the connection
text: is broken and the phone goes dead. Clay steps out of the
text: booth, takes a deep breath of ocean air.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Whale and Hanna go through the closet together.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Mr. Boone. He is an interesting
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'd hardly call our yardman a
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. But someone you can talk to.
text: Whale stops, turns to Hanna.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Do you miss having someone to talk
dialog: to, Hanna?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I have my family. Also our Lord
dialog: Jesus Christ.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Of course. How is the old boy
dialog: these days?
text: The naughty remark is met with a solemn stare. Whale
text: reaches up, chooses a lightweight blue suit.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It needs a hat. There was a
text: wide-brimmed cream fedora...
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It must be up in your old room. I
dialog: will look.
text: The phone rings. Hanna hurries to answer it.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MAIN HALL - DAY
text: Hanna speaks softly in Hungarian. Whale points upstairs to
dialog: let her know he will look for the hat himself.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
text: Whale opens the closet door and takes down a stack of
text: hatboxes from the overhead shelf. He opens the first box,
text: takes out a rubbery wad of heavy fabric with two round
text: windows like eyes. It's a gas mask. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TRENCHES - NIGHT (1917)
text: The night sky explodes with light and smoke. Whale moves
text: calmly through the chaos, trying to maintain a modicum of
text: order among the troops.
speaker_heading: WHALE
text: Gas masks on. Gas masks on.
text: At the end of the line, young Barnett is struggling with his
text: straps. Mustard gas is starting to stream into the trench.
speaker_heading: BARNETT
dialog: Don't mind me, Lieutenant. Save
dialog: yourself.
text: Whale slips the mask over Barnett's face, fastens it. He
text: slides his own mask into position moments before the trench
text: is obliterated by the yellowish smoke. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
text: Hanna stands in the door with a forlorn frown.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Oh, Mr. Jimmy. You make a mess of
dialog: it. Here.
text: Hanna lifts the lid of an unopened box to show him the
text: missing fedora.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: (stacking boxes)
dialog: That is my daughter. She say she
dialog: and her husband are coming to town
dialog: this afternoon. I am sorry, Mr.
dialog: Jimmy. I will make it short.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'll be out this afternoon,
dialog: remember? Your family can visit as
dialog: long as they like.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No. I do not cook for them. My
dialog: daughter's no-good husband will not
dialog: take one bite of our food.
text: Hanna holds out the box for the gas mask. Whale gives it a
text: long, final look, then drops it in the box.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You can toss this one in the trash.
text: Hanna clamps the lid on the box.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY
text: Hanna has opened the door. At the end of the hall,
text: silhouetted against the bright afternoon sky, is Clay. His
text: shoulders fill the doorway. The top of his head is
text: perfectly flat.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Good afternoon, Clayton.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Do I look okay?
text: Clay steps into the light. His khaki pants are clean and
text: pressed. A blue knit shirt fits his muscles snugly.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You look splendid, my boy. Quite
dialog: splendid.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY
text: Whale crosses to the passenger side of the Chrysler.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I suppose you'd like the top down.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: If that's okay?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Nothing would please me more.
text: Clay squeezes behind the wheel, shifts the seat back,
text: explores switches. The vinyl top pops up and folds
dialog: backward.
text: Whale gets in. Clay starts the engine and backs out.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Hanna stands at the front door, hands tangled in her apron.
text: Whale tugs his hat brim at her as the car swings around the
dialog: driveway.
text: Whale smiles at the wide open sky overhead. Clay steps on
text: the gas and the Chrysler takes off.
scene_heading: EXT. CUKOR HOUSE - DAY
text: The party is clearly audible from the road, where Clay has
text: squeezed the Chrysler into a long row of shiny cars nuzzling
text: the high brick wall. Whale puts his dark glasses on.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Stars, you know. The suns of other
dialog: galaxies.
text: They walk up the steep road to the gatehouse.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Good old George. He loves to put
text: on the dog. Only his dogs tend to
dialog: have a bit of mutt.
text: A WOMAN at the gate inspects the invitation, waves them
dialog: through.
scene_heading: EXT. CUKOR HOUSE - LAWN - DAY
text: A sunny patio with hedges and statues. Wickets and stakes
text: have been set up for a game of croquet, but only a handful
text: of very tanned children strut around with mallets.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What did I tell you? Listen.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I don't hear anything.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Exactly. Cukor was too cheap to
dialog: hire music. There's nothing but
text: chin-wag. The cold dreary custard
text: of English chin-wag.
text: Whale scans the crowd.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Slim pickings. Well, it's early
dialog: yet. Perhaps this is a good time
dialog: to pay our respects.
text: Clay follows Whale toward a trellis alcove covered in ivy.
text: A handful of people grin at the mismatched couple who stand
text: in the shade: a homely older man in glasses and a pretty
text: woman in a white dress with polka dots. GEORGE CUKOR and
scene_heading: PRINCESS MARGARET.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Let's get this over with quickly.
text: Whale forgets to remove his hat when he comes forward.
text: Before he can give Cukor their names Princess Margaret's
text: polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth.
scene_heading: PRINCESS MARGARET
dialog: I had no idea you'd be here.
text: She seizes Whale's hand in her little white gloves.
scene_heading: PRINCESS MARGARET
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal
dialog: Highness?
scene_heading: PRINCESS MARGARET
dialog: Splendid. Now that I know you're
dialog: around.
text: Standing beside him, Clay is clearly impressed that Whale
dialog: knows a princess.
scene_heading: PRINCESS MARGARET
dialog: Can we get together while I'm in
dialog: town? I so badly want to sit for
dialog: you again.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Sit?
scene_heading: PRINCESS MARGARET
dialog: I've changed my hair, you see.
dialog: Since our last session. Those old
text: snaps look rather dowdy now.
text: Whale realizes she's mistaken him for someone else. He tugs
text: his sunglasses down his nose so she can see his eyes.
scene_heading: PRINCESS MARGARET
dialog: Oh dear. Have I made a blunder?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. James
dialog: Whale.
scene_heading: PRINCESS MARGARET
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I am such a goose. I mistook you
dialog: for Cecil Beaton. It's the hat.
dialog: You're wearing one of Cecil's hats,
dialog: you know.
text: Whale attempts to chuckle while he fights a feeling of
text: humiliation. He turns to Cukor for help.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Hello, George. James Whale. David
dialog: Lewis's friend. I once made
dialog: pictures myself, Ma'am.
speaker_heading: GEORGE CUKOR
dialog: Yes. Of course. One can't throw a
dialog: rock in this town without hitting
dialog: one of us old movie directors.
text: Whale feels the sting. He turns to Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Ma'am, may I present Mr. Clayton
dialog: Boone?
text: Clay steps forward to shake hands.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: My gardener, who insisted I bring
dialog: him today. He so wanted to meet
dialog: royalty.
text: Cukor's face goes blank with indignation.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Pleased to meet you.
scene_heading: PRINCESS MARGARET
dialog: Quite. I adore gardens.
text: Whale narrows his eyes at Cukor and sharpens his smile.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: He's never met a princess. Only
dialog: queens.
text: Cukor puffs out his chest, quivers a bulbous lower lip at
dialog: Whale.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: George, Ma'am, this has been an
dialog: honor. An occasion to remember for
dialog: the rest of my days.
text: He leads Clay away and an American couple promptly crowd in
text: to take their place. Striding through the garden, Whale is
text: obviously pleased with himself.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Nothing of importance. Just two
text: old men slapping each other with
dialog: lilies. Shall we have a drink?
text: Whale leads Clay to a tented bar. Across the way, David
text: Lewis has come through the gate with a WOMAN on his arm.
text: People look discreetly, not at David but at the woman,
text: lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: David. The friend I thought was in
dialog: New York.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No. The girl.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Girl? Oh. Elizabeth Taylor.
text: Clay watches in amazement as ELIZABETH TAYLOR waves to
text: someone and pipes out a happy hello. She hurriedly unties
text: her scarf, thrusts it at David and runs off on tiptoes to
text: embrace a woman.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Is that really her?
speaker_heading: WHALE
text: David produced her last picture.
text: David glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat
text: pocket. He sees Whale looking at him. He puts on a tight
text: smile and strolls across the patio.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Just what I was about to ask you.
dialog: I thought you were in New York.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was, until last night. Publicity
dialog: asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for
dialog: today's reception.
text: The waiter arrives with their drinks. Only when Clay takes
text: his glass of beer does David see that Whale is not alone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: David Lewis.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Clay Boone.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Our yardman. Who was kind enough
dialog: to serve as my escort to George's
dialog: little do.
text: David freezes. Whale lifts his martini glass at Clay and
text: takes a sip.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Should you be drinking in your
dialog: condition?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
text: Clay clears his throat, eager to escape this domestic
text: squabble.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I think I'll go look at Elizabeth
dialog: Taylor.
text: He hurries off.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You should have seen Georgie's face
dialog: when he met Clayton.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You didn't, Jimmy.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I did. But Princess Margaret was a
dialog: doll. We're all equals in her
dialog: eyes. As commoners, I presume.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You only embarrass yourself.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh dear. I'll never work in this
dialog: town again?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know what I mean. Your
dialog: reputation.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: But I have no reputation. I'm as
text: free as the air.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well the rest of us aren't. Can't
dialog: you remember that?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No. I never could. You must
dialog: regret having had the invitation
dialog: sent.
text: David is looking over Whale's shoulder.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I didn't ask George to invite you.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Then who did?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jimmy, there are people here I need
dialog: to speak to. You'll be fine on
dialog: your own?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Yes. Perfectly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All right, then. I'll come by tomorrow
dialog: for breakfast.
text: Whale nods, watches David stroll over to the pool and greet
text: a gaggle of executives. Whale drifts toward some deck
text: chairs at the far end of the croquet lawn. He sits, takes a
text: sip of his drink. Suddenly a high-pitched giggle pierces
dialog: the air.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Mr. Whale!
text: Whale looks out to see Edmund Kay, his interviewer from
text: several weeks ago, marching across the lawn.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Mr....Kay?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Bet you thought you'd never see me
dialog: again. I didn't know if you'd be
dialog: well enough to come to this party.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You didn't?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I'm the one who got you on Mr.
dialog: Cukor's guest list.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You, Mr. Kay? How do you know
dialog: George Cukor?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: I interviewed him after I met you.
dialog: I'm his social secretary now.
text: Well, assistant to his secretary.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I commend you. If you're going to
dialog: pursue poofs, go after those who
dialog: can do favors for you. You waste
dialog: everybody's time when you court
dialog: dinosaurs.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Don't think that, Mr. Whale. I
dialog: love your movies. That's why I
dialog: wanted you to come to this. So I
dialog: could see you with your monsters.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: My monsters?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Don't go away.
text: Whale tries to do just that, but finds himself caught in the
text: chair. He is stumbling to his feet when Kay returns with
text: Elsa Lanchester, 55, at his side.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: Jimmy. How are you?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Elsa?
text: She takes Whale's hand, with a look of deep concern and
text: sympathy. Kay races off again.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago.
dialog: She said you'd been under the
dialog: weather.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh, nothing out of the ordinary.
dialog: Growing old.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: We're all getting a bit long in the
dialog: tooth.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: But you appear quite fresh, my
dialog: dear.
text: She swats aside the compliment and gestures at the chair.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: Please. You shouldn't stand on my
dialog: account.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Perfectly all right. But if you'd
dialog: like to sit --
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: I'm fine, Jimmy. I can only stay a
dialog: few minutes.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: What's our pesky friend up to now?
text: Kay returns, accompanied by a stopped, gray-haired man with
text: a long rectangular face and wary, heavy-lidded eyes.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: Is that Boris? Our little chum
text: appears to be arranging a reunion.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh dear.
text: Karloff, age 70, comes reluctantly, followed by his niece
text: ALICE, a bashful young woman who carried a blanket-wrapped
dialog: bundle.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: Boris, darling. I didn't know you
dialog: were here. These public revels are
dialog: hardly up your alley.
speaker_heading: BORIS KARLOFF
dialog: I came for the sake of my visiting
dialog: niece. Alice. And Miranda, my
dialog: great-niece.
text: His huge hand lifts the blanket in Alice's arms, revealing a
text: bald infant with enormous blue eyes. Karloff gurgles and
text: coos at the child.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: And what do you make of our royal
dialog: visitant?
speaker_heading: BORIS KARLOFF
dialog: Perfectly charming. A real lady.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: Of course she's a lady. What did
dialog: you expect? A hussy in tennis
dialog: shoes?
text: Whale looks up and discovers Clay standing a few feet behind
text: Karloff. He is ogling two bosomy actresses who are
text: listening intently to the monocled British consul.
text: Whale's eyes try to focus Karloff and Clay together, his
text: once and future monsters. Kay shouts to a passing
text: photographer carrying a bulky Speed Graphic.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Hey, you! With the camera! We got
dialog: a historical moment here. Come get
text: a picture of it.
text: The man scans the scene for a famous face.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: This is Mr. James Whale, who made
dialog: "Frankenstein" and "Bride of
dialog: Frankenstein." and this is the
dialog: Monster and his Bride.
text: Clay looks up when he hears Kay identify Karloff.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Oh, Karloff. Right.
text: Karloff and Elsa drift into position next to Whale. The
text: flash goes off, a snap and a crunch of light. Whale cringes
dialog: in pain.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: (through clenched teeth)
dialog: Don't you just love being famous?
text: Another flash. From Whale's perspective, the bulb resembles
dialog: nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical
text: current from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory. Whale
text: concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his
text: brain. He clutches Elsa Lanchester's hand.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: Are you all right, Jimmy?
text: A sharp nod from Whale. The photographer motions to
dialog: Karloff's niece.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Let me get one with Frankenstein
text: holding the kid.
text: Alice hands over the baby. Karloff gently cradles the
text: child. Whale stands on his left, Elsa on his right. They
text: all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up. Whale
text: follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks
text: and strains in a furious electrical storm.
text: The camera flashes once, then again.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Got it!
text: Whale glances up -- the kite is gone. Thunder rumbles as
text: the group starts to disperse. Whale nods to the faces
text: exchanging good-byes.
speaker_heading: BORIS KARLOFF
dialog: So good to see you again, James.
text: He strolls off, clucking and cooing at his baby.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Catch you before you go, Mr. Whale.
dialog: I'll make sure everybody gets sent
text: a print.
text: He goes off with the photographer. Elsa kisses Whale on the
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: ELSA LANCHESTER
dialog: We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Good-bye. So nice to see you...
text: Finally Whale is alone. He staggers to the deck chair and
text: lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You okay?
text: Whale gazes up at Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
text: Tired. A bit tired.
text: Clay nods. Whale smiles at him.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Are you enjoying yourself?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Actually, no. I feel a little out
dialog: of place.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Neither of us really belongs here.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Must have been funny for you.
dialog: Seeing your monsters again.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Monsters? The only monsters...
dialog: (closes his eyes)
dialog: ...are here.
text: Across the lawn, conversation has stopped. Birdlike shrieks
dialog: come from all directions.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Oh fuck. And we left the top down.
dialog: You want to run for it?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Run for what?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Can't you see? It's raining!
text: The rain is only a flickering of air, but people are jumping
text: and shrieking, throwing coats over their heads as they dash
text: toward the house.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Here.
text: He takes Whale under the arm, helps him up and escorts him
text: to a small tent. On the patio, everyone shoves and squeezes
text: to get through the one open door.
text: Whale stares out, hypnotized by the deluge. From his POV,
text: we see a young man step into the rain. Whale squints, is
text: finally able to identify the man as Leonard Barnett.
text: Whale's eyes follow Barnett as he emerges onto a new
text: landscape, a scarred and barren battlefield. As the storm
dialog: continues to rage:
speaker_heading: CLAY (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Whale?
text: Whale shifts his gaze to Clay. He takes a moment to orient
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Let's get out of this funk hole
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You don't want to wait it out?
dialog: Rain should let up soon.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: We're not sugar. We won't melt.
text: Whale adjusts the brim of his hat and steps into the
text: downpour. Clay has no choice except to follow. They walk
text: briskly, the minute splashes on Whale's hat forming a
text: ghostly aura of spray.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Whale opens the door and climbs in next to Clay. The roof
text: slowly closes over them.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I better get you home before you
dialog: catch your death from pneumonia.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Catch my death.
text: Clay glances over, sees Whale sitting very wet and rigid,
text: staring straight ahead.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You all right, Mr. Whale?
text: Whale blinks, slowly turns. There is a cracked look in his
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Jimmy. Please. Call me Jimmy.
text: Clay smiles, starts to back the car out.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - FOYER - DUSK
text: The hallway is pitch-dark as Whale and Clay enter.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Hanna! Bring us some towels.
dialog: We're drenched to the bone!
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Blast her. If we soil her holy
dialog: floor, it's her own damn fault.
text: Whale goes squashing down the hall. Clay remains just
text: inside the open door, prying off his shoes and peeling off
text: his socks. He follows Whale into:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
text: Whale stands over the table with his jaw open.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I don't believe this.
text: He slides a note to Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: It's not like her.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Just a night out. Sounds like she
dialog: can't say no to her daughter.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Certainly you have better things to
dialog: do than babysit an old man?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Good. Let's get dry.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale stands just inside the closet, buttoning a crisp white
text: shirt. He reaches for a red bow tie, closes the closet
text: door. In the mirror, Leonard Barnett stands behind him, in
text: uniform. Whale's eyes twinkle in surprise. He drapes the
text: tie around his collar.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What do you think?
text: Barnett smiles his approval.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Clay opens the bathroom door, calls out.

dialog: Mr. Whale?
text: No answer. He goes to the top of the stairs and calls out.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Where's those clothes you promised?
text: Again, nothing. Rain ticks against the windows. Clay goes
text: down the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale fiddles with the knot of his tie.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: He trusts me, you know.
text: Barnett sits on the edge of the bed now. He smiles, a bit
dialog: sadly.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: There's glow coming from the bedroom, and the sound of
text: Whale's voice.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Mr. Whale? Jimmy?
text: Clay steps slowly toward the door, pushes it open. He peers
dialog: in.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale pulls on a blazer.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Mr. Whale?
text: Whale jumps. He slaps a hand over his chest, twists around,
text: sees Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh, of course. Clayton. You
dialog: finished your shower already?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear
dialog: me calling?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry.
dialog: (stands)
dialog: I believe I promised you some
dialog: clothes.
text: Whale crosses to the closet. Barnett is nowhere to be seen.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You're much wider than I am. You
dialog: won't want to attempt to get into
dialog: my pants.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No. Definitely not.
text: Clay chuckles. Whale smiles.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Very good, Clayton.
text: He takes a robe from a hook on the closet door. Clay tries
text: it on but it won't close over the towel.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I know.
text: Whale opens a drawer, takes out a crewneck sweater.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Absolutely swims on me, but should
dialog: take care of your upper half.
text: Clay pulls the sweater over his head.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: That only leaves the rest.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You don't have any baggy shorts?
dialog: Pajama bottoms?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Sorry. My pajamas are tailored.
dialog: Would it be too distressing to
dialog: continue with the towel? No more
dialog: immodest than a kilt, you know.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Do I have any other choice?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Very sporting of you, Clayton.
text: Clay notices a framed drawing on the desk.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Is that --?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: The only memento I ever kept. My
dialog: original sketch for the Monster.
text: He hands the sketch to Clay, who stares down at the famous
text: flat head, hooded eyes, bolted neck of the Monster.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Shall we?
text: Clay puts down the sketch, starts into the hall. Whale
text: turns back, sees Barnett standing by the window. Whale
text: flips off the light and closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Clay sits at the kitchen table. Whale opens the
text: refrigerator and brings out two plates wrapped in wax paper,
text: and a bottle of beer for Clay. He pours himself a shot of
text: Scotch from a decanter and sits down.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: After dinner, if Hanna isn't back?
dialog: Can we try a few more sketches?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I thought you'd given up on my
dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'd like to try again. If you're
dialog: game.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Why not? Give us something to do
dialog: while we wait.
text: Clay munches on his sandwich. Whale pours himself another
text: Scotch, takes a sip.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Tell me something, Clayton. Do
dialog: you believe in mercy killing?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Never gave it much thought.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Come now. I'm sure you came across
dialog: such situations in Korea. A
dialog: wounded comrade, or perhaps one of
dialog: the enemy? Someone for whom death
dialog: would be a blessing.
text: Clay stops chewing. He stares down at his plate.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I never went.
text: He takes a deep breath, looks up at Whale.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I never made it to Korea.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: But you said --
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: -- that I was a Marine. Which is
dialog: true. You filled in the rest.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I see.
text: Clay downs his beer, refills the glass.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: My old man was a Marine. He
dialog: enlisted the day he turned
dialog: seventeen.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: The Great War?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: By the time he was ready to ship
text: out, the fighting was over. He
dialog: missed out.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: A very lucky thing indeed.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: That's not the way he saw it. To
dialog: him, it was like his life never got
dialog: started. Nothing else really
dialog: mattered. Definitely not his
dialog: family.
text: Whale gazes sympathetically at Clay.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: The morning after Pearl Harbor, he
dialog: drove down to St. Louis to
dialog: reenlist. He was so damn excited.
dialog: World War II was going to be his
dialog: second chance.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: They told him he was too old...fat
dialog: ...nearsighted. Said he'd be more
dialog: use to his country if he stayed
dialog: home and looked after his family.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Is that why you joined the Marines?
dialog: For your father's sake?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I figured he'd think, you know --
dialog: it was the next best thing. Hey, I
dialog: loved it too. A chance to be a
dialog: part of something important.
dialog: Something bigger than yourself.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I didn't have the guts for it.
text: A look of surprise crosses Whale's face.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I mean, literally. My body
dialog: screwed me up. Burst appendix.
dialog: They gave me a medical discharge.
dialog: All I thought about was, how am I
dialog: going to tell the old man.
text: He breaks into a crooked smile.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You know what he did when I called
dialog: him? He laughed. He laughed so
text: hard he practically burst a blood
dialog: vessel. Said it was a good lesson
dialog: for me. Not to try to fill his
dialog: shoes.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I'm very sorry.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Them's the breaks, right? No war
dialog: stories for this pup.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: That's where you're wrong, Clayton.
dialog: You've just told one. A very good
dialog: story indeed.
text: Whale lifts his glass in a toast. Clay empties his glass of
text: beer. He motions toward the decanter.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Do you mind?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Not at all.
text: He hands the decanter to Clay.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Clay sits in a straight-backed chair, smoking a cigarette
text: and sipping his Scotch. Whale sketches from a wing chair
text: across the room.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Storm's getting worse.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: "A perfect night for mystery and
text: horror. The air itself is filled
dialog: with monsters."
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: That's from your movie, right?
dialog: "The only monsters are here."
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I don't remember that one.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: James Whale. This afternoon at the
dialog: party.
text: Whale looks up.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I said it must be weird seeing your
dialog: monsters again, and you said, "The
dialog: only monsters are here." I was
dialog: wondering which here you meant.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I don't recall. Memories of the
dialog: war, perhaps.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: But that was so long ago. It can't
dialog: still bother you.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh, but it does. Especially in
dialog: light of the journey I'm about to
dialog: make.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You're planning a trip?
text: Whale's gaze remains dreamy and preoccupied as SOUNDS of
text: battle fill the room. A relentless rat-a-tat of gunfire.
text: The whistling of bombs. The tortured wailing of dying men.
text: Whale stands, moves over to the window.
speaker_heading: WHALE
text: Barnett. Barnett on the wire.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Your friend?
text: Whale gazes out at the storm. From his POV, we see a
text: scarred and barren landscape, illuminated by occasional
text: flashes of lightning.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: He caught his one night coming back
dialog: from the reconnoiter. I wouldn't
dialog: take him out, but McGill did. Just
dialog: to give the lad a taste. They were
text: nearly home when a Maxim gun opened
dialog: fire.
scene_heading: EXT. TRENCHES - NIGHT (1917)
text: We race along the open trench with Whale, the darkened sky
text: intermittently punctured by bursts of gunfire. He reaches
text: the periscope, pulls an enlisted man off it. From his POV,
text: we see Barnett and McGill dodging bullets as they attempt to
dialog: make their way back.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (through clenched teeth)
dialog: Come on. Come on.
text: McGill leaps over the barbed wire of a forward trench.
text: Barnett follows. Just as his feet leave the ground his
text: chest is riddled by a fresh round of gunfire. Whale's eyes
text: snap closed, trying to obliterate what they've just seen.
speaker_heading: WHALE (V.O.)
text: Barnett's body fell in wire as
text: thick as briers. It was hanging
dialog: there the next morning, a hundred
text: yards from the line, too far out
dialog: for anyone to fetch it.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale stares out impassively.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: We saw him at morning stand-to and
dialog: evening stand-to. "Good morning,
dialog: Barnett," we'd say each day.
dialog: "How's ole Barnett looking this
dialog: morning?" "Seems a little peaky.
text: Looks a little plumper." His
dialog: wounds faced the other way and his
text: hat shielded his eyes, so one could
dialog: imagine he was napping on
dialog: bedsprings. He hung there until we
dialog: were relieved. We introduced him
dialog: to the new unit before we marched
dialog: out, speaking highly of his
dialog: companionship.
text: Clay's eyes are filled with pity.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh, but we were a witty lot.
dialog: Laughing at our dead. Telling
dialog: ourselves it was our death too.
dialog: But with each man who died, I
dialog: thought, "Better you than me, poor
dialog: sod."
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: A whole generation was wiped out by
dialog: that war. Millions and millions of
text: young men.
text: Whale begins to hum, a tune we have heard before:
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling?
dialog: Grave where thy victory?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You survived it. It can't hurt you
dialog: now. It's no good to dig it up.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh no, my friend. It's digging
dialog: itself up. There is nothing in the
dialog: here and now to take my mind off
dialog: it. All my diversions have
dialog: abandoned me. Parties. Reading.
dialog: Painting. Work. Love. All gone
dialog: to me now.
text: Whale remains perfectly still, staring out the window. Clay
text: deliberates a moment, then puts down his drink next to the
text: decanter of Scotch. He stands and yanks the neck of the
text: sweater over his face, then tosses it on the sofa. Whale
text: blinks at the reflection in the glass, not yet
dialog: understanding.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You wanted to draw me like a Greek
dialog: statue. All right, then.
text: Clay pulls at the knot, lets go of the towel. He defiantly
text: parks his hands on his hips.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: There. Not so bad.
text: Whale continues to stare at the reflection, his back to
text: Clay, his eyes wide and expressionless. He turns slowly,
text: fully expecting the vision to evaporate. When he sees that
text: Clay is truly naked he mutters softly under his breath.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: So it is going to happen after all.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What'd you say?
text: Whale doesn't respond. Finally he opens his mouth to take a
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No. It won't do.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What won't do?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You are much too human.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What did you expect? Bronze?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Don't move.
text: Whale moves abruptly across the room. He walks past Clay.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale passes quickly through the dining room and out to the
dialog: kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Whale reaches for the hatbox, which sits on top of a garbage
text: can. Suddenly a large hand appears on the box. Whale gasps
text: when a flash of lightning reveals the face of the Monster.
text: The Monster growls out an inarticulate greeting. He picks
text: up the box and hands it to Whale.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale removes the lid, sets the hatbox on the sofa.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I would like you to wear this?
text: Whale steps back. Clay takes the box and covers his lap
text: with it. He lifts out the gas mask.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: For the artistic effect. The
dialog: combination of your human body and
dialog: that inhuman mask. It's quite
dialog: striking.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Please, Clayton. Just for a
dialog: minute. Long enough for me to see
dialog: the effect.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It's from the first World War,
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: (nods)
text: There are straps in back.
text: Clay fits the mask on the top of his head and draws it down.
text: The living room turns brownish yellow in the thick glass
text: goggles.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Let me help you.
text: Whale is suddenly behind him. Clay's vision is enclosed in
text: two round windows, so he can't see Whale buckling the second
dialog: strap.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Now what?
text: Mouth muffled by the inhalator, Clay hears his voice from
text: inside his head. Whale comes around to stand in front of
text: him. He grins as he steps back to examine Clay. Clay
text: nervously taps his knees with his hands.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: All right. Let's take it off now.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It's too tight.
text: Clay raises his voice to make himself heard. He reaches
text: back to undo the buckles.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Allow me.
text: Whale steps in past the goggles.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: We don't want to tear the straps.
text: Clay drops his hands so Whale can undo the buckles. But
text: nothing happens. Clay turns left and right.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh yes. I am still here.
text: Two hands grip Clay's shoulders.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What steely muscles, Clayton.
text: Whale's hands squeeze. Clay grabs the frame of his seat, to
text: stop his arms from automatically swinging a fist. Whale's
text: hand slides over Clay's shoulder to his arm, caressing the
text: tattoo. Clay jerks his shoulder to shake Whale off.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Just take off the fucking mask!
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Relax, Clayton. I can't hear you.
dialog: I can't hear a word.
text: Whale presses his lips to Clay's tattoo. Clay's muscles
text: tense from head to toe.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What a solid brute you are.
text: Whale's tongue moves down Clay's arm.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No? Maybe this, then?
text: The hand slides over Clay's stomach toward his lap. The
text: tattooed arm swings backward, slamming an elbow against
text: Whale's skull. Clay jumps from the chair, knocking into an
text: end table. The glass and crystal decanter fall to the
text: floor. The lamp spills over and the room goes dark.
text: Clay's ankle is caught by the sofa leg and he hits the
text: floor, jamming the inhalator against his mouth. He quickly
text: gets up, on his knees and elbows, pulling at the mask.
text: Flashes of lightning strobe the room as Whale collapses over
text: Clay's back and holds on.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh yes. I have you now.
text: A strap breaks. Clay rips the mask off.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Get the fuck off!
text: Whale's hand squeezes between Clay's legs.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What will you do to get yourself
dialog: back?
text: Clay jabs with his elbow, flipping Whale on his back. His
text: body straddles Whale's and pins him, face to face.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm not that way. Get it through
dialog: your fucking head. I don't want to
dialog: mess with you.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
text: His hands clasp Clay's hips. Clay's fist opens as it comes
text: down; he slaps Whale across the face.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: That didn't even sting. You're not
dialog: such a real man after all. Are
dialog: you?
text: Clay whacks Whale's face again.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Wait until I tell my friends I had
dialog: you naked in my arms. Won't they
dialog: be surprised?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I haven't done a damn thing with
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh, but you have. You undressed
dialog: for me. I kissed you. I even
dialog: touched your prick. How will you
dialog: be able to live with yourself?
text: Clay snatches Whale's wrist before it can touch his crotch.
text: With his other hand he picks up the heavy crystal decanter.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: What the hell do you want from me?!
text: Whale tilts his face up for another blow.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I want you to kill me.
text: Clay freezes. He stares down at the old man with white hair
text: and wild eyes lying beneath him.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Break my neck. Or strangle me. It
dialog: would be oh so easy to wrap your
text: hands around my neck and choke the
dialog: life out of me. Please, Clayton.
dialog: We've come this far.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You're crazy.
text: Whale's eyes glimmer in the sporadic bursts of lightning.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Exactly, I'm losing my mind.
dialog: Every day, another piece goes.
dialog: Soon there will be nothing left.
dialog: Look at the sketch I made of you.
text: Clay turns to the sketch pad, which lies on the floor next
text: to Whale. The page is filled with nothing but doodles and
text: scrawls.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Look, if you want to die do it
dialog: yourself!
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: No, I don't want to die alone. But
dialog: to be killed by you -- that would
dialog: make death bearable. They say you
dialog: never see the one with your name on
dialog: it. But I want to see death coming
dialog: at me. I want it to be sharp and
dialog: hard, with a human face. Your
dialog: face. Think, Clayton. You'd be my
dialog: second Monster. Almost as famous
dialog: as the first. It would be the
dialog: great adventure you've yearned for.
dialog: A war story for both of us to
dialog: share.
text: Clay's breathing comes in quick, panicked bursts.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You'd be fully exonerated, I've
dialog: taken care of that. I wrote a
dialog: note, I'll even leave you the
dialog: house, the car...
text: Clay's body starts to tremble.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Do it now, Clayton. Make me
dialog: invisible.
text: Clay lets out a howl -- his shoulders heave and shake.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I am not your monster.
text: He climbs off Whale, crawls away, his body collapsing in
text: wracking, anguished sobs. Whale opens his eyes, gazes at
dialog: Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What have I done?
dialog: (sits up)
dialog: Oh, selfish, selfish fool. I
dialog: have lost my mind.
text: He forces himself to his feet.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: What was I thinking?
text: Whale picks up the towel and moves over to Clay.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: You're a softhearted bloke. A
text: bloody pussycat.
text: Whale places the towel around Clay's shoulders.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: My deepest apologies. Can you ever
dialog: forgive me?
text: Clay doesn't look up.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I suppose not.
dialog: (a bone-crushing sigh)
dialog: Good God, I am tired. I really
dialog: must go to bed.
text: Whale starts slowly down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale sits on the edge of the bed, tugs the bowtie from his
text: collar. Clay taps on the door, opens it.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Oh Clayton.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Did I hurt you?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Nothing I didn't deserve.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Need some help?
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Pray you, undo this button.
text: He lifts his chin and points to his collar.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I can never manage it when I'm
dialog: tired.
text: Clay leans in to open the button. His face is only six
text: inches from Whale's.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Do you believe people come into our
dialog: lives for a reason?
text: Clay doesn't answer. Whale turns, breaking their shared
dialog: gaze.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: I can undress myself, thank you.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: (steps back)
dialog: All right.
text: Whale hauls his legs up and stretches out on the bed.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: When you die...be sure your brain
dialog: is the last organ to fizzle --
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: You'll feel better tomorrow.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Tomorrow and tomorrow and
dialog: tomorrow...
text: Whale smiles fondly at him.
speaker_heading: WHALE
dialog: Goodnight, Clayton.
text: Clay pulls the door shut and it clicks. He stands there a
dialog: moment.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Clay shakes open a bedsheet and wraps himself in it.
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Clay finds a pack of cigarettes on the floor and lights one,
text: then sets the furniture back up. He picks up the gas mask
text: from beside the sofa, shoves it into its box.
text: Clay sits in the wing-back chair, props his feet on the
text: hassock, adjusting the sheet around his shoulders. We CUT
dialog: TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Whale bolts up in bed. An electrical storm flashes and
text: cracks in the window.
text: Whale gets out of bed, stares outside. From his POV, the
text: lawn is a barren slope covered with stumps.
text: Whale turns on the desk lamp, sits. He pulls out a piece
dialog: of paper.
scene_heading: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT
text: We're back to the scene that opened the movie, a flat-topped
text: creature stumbling through the mud. A flash of lightning
text: reveals Clay's face. He turns, signals for Whale to follow
text: him. Whale joins Clay on a slight rise of ground, the rim
text: of a crater. Clay points down into it.
scene_heading: EXT. CRATER - NIGHT
text: The crater is full of bodies gathered around a pool of
text: water. Whale stumbles down, reaches the bottom and bends
text: over the nearest corpse in khaki. It is Leonard Barnett.
text: There are no wounds on his body, no rips or gaping holes.
text: His eyes are closed in dreamless sleep.
text: Whale looks up and sees that Clay is gone. The only other
text: living creature is an owl, which blinks wearily at him.
text: Whale lies down, finding a spot next to Barnett. He takes a
text: last breath and closes his eyes. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: A roar of bells blasts Clay awake. The telephone is
text: ringing. A hard pair of shoes thunder out to answer it.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Hello? Oh, Mr. David!
text: Clay blinks at the sight of Hanna in black dress and white
text: apron, chattering on the phone by the far wall.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: No, no, he did not tell me. But no
dialog: problem. I will make breakfast.
text: She scoldingly cuts her eyes at Clay.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Ten? Very good, then. Good-bye.
text: She hangs up and faces Clay with a stern frown.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: It's not what you think.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I have brought you your clothes.
dialog: All I ask is that you get dressed
dialog: and go. We are having a guest for
dialog: breakfast.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I need to talk to you about Mr.
dialog: Whale.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: There is nothing you can say that
dialog: will surprise me.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Maybe. But I still need to talk.
dialog: Do I have time for a cup of coffee
dialog: before I go?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: I blame my daughter for keeping me
dialog: out so late. I only hope you did
dialog: not get him excited. It could give
text: him a new stroke.
text: She stomps into the kitchen. Clay gets up, slips on his
text: undershorts. He's zipping up his chinos when she comes out
text: again with a breakfast tray. She hands him a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Why do you do it?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What do I do?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Take care of Mr. Whale like he was
dialog: your flesh and blood.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: It is my job. I did it when he was
dialog: happy and it was easy. It is only
dialog: fair I do it now when he is ill.
dialog: (picks up the tray)
dialog: Enough talk. I must wake up the
dialog: master.
text: She marches around the corner towards Whale's bedroom. Clay
text: hears her knocking on a door.
speaker_heading: HANNA (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Jimmy? Morning, Mr. Jimmy.
text: Clay pulls on his shirt. Hanna comes back around the
dialog: corner.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: What have you done with him?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I put him to bed. He's not there?
text: She goes to the foot of the stairs and shouts:
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Mr. Jimmy! Mr. Jimmy!
text: Hanna starts up the stairs.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Look for him!
text: Clay reaches for his socks when he notices an envelope on
text: the floor next to the chair. He picks it up. On the front
text: is scrawled the word 'CLAYTON'. Clay opens the envelope.
text: Inside is Whale's original sketch of the Monster's head. He
text: turns it over. There is a message written on the back.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: No.
text: Clay drops the sketch, looks out. He sees something.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
text: Clay crosses the patio, hurtles down the slope.
scene_heading: EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - POOL - DAY
text: Clay leaps headfirst into the water. Whale rests lightly on
text: his back, with an upward sway of straight white hair. Clay
text: hauls the body toward the side.
speaker_heading: CLAY
text: Almost there. Almost there.
text: He gets an arm around Whale's chest and heaves the body over
text: the curb. he climbs out, drags the body forward to rest in
text: the grass. He grabs the wrist. Nothing.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Son of a bitch. You crazy son of a
dialog: bitch.
text: Clay straddles Whale's thighs and applies pressure on his
text: rib cage. But it's no use. Clay sits up and takes a deep
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Ohhh!
text: Hanna comes down the path, her run slowing to a walk. She
text: stares at Clay.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I didn't do it. This wasn't me.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: He wanted me to kill him, but I
dialog: didn't. He did it himself.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: He says here good-bye. I find it
text: in his room. He is sorry, he says.
dialog: He has had a wonderful life.
text: She waves a folded piece of paper.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You poor, foolish man. You
dialog: couldn't wait for God to take you
dialog: in his time?
text: Clay slowly stands up. Hanna looks around in panic.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You must leave. You were not here
dialog: this morning.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: But I didn't do this!
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: The police will not know that.
dialog: They will want to investigate.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: We have his note.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Do you want to be questioned about
dialog: you and Mr. Jimmy? Please,
dialog: Clayton. It will be better if I
text: find the body alone.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: But how're you going to explain
dialog: this?
dialog: (points at the body)
dialog: How did you get him out of the
dialog: pool?
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: You are right. Yes. We must put
dialog: him back.
text: They both hesitate, looking down at Whale. Then Clay drags
text: the body parallel with the pool. Hanna stoops over to
text: adjust the collar of Whale's shirt.
speaker_heading: HANNA
dialog: Poor Mr. Jimmy. We do not mean
dialog: disrespect. You will keep better
dialog: in water.
text: She nods to Clay. He rolls the body over and it splashes on
text: its belly. It bounces a moment in the waves of the splash,
text: then begins to sink. As it drops, the air in the chest
text: slowly flips the body around.
text: Looking up at them with open eyes, Whale sinks backward into
text: the thickening light. His arms trail upward and the hands
text: lightly flutter as if waving good-bye. The melancholy sound
text: of a solo violin pierces the silence as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT./INT. BLIND MAN'S HUT - NIGHT
text: A black-and-white scene from "Bride of Frankenstein." The
text: old BLIND MAN plays a mournful lullaby on his violin while
text: the MONSTER listens outside, moved by the music. He smashes
text: open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the
text: soul-soothing sound. The blind man stops playing, looks up.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Who is it? You're welcome, my
dialog: friend, whoever you are.
text: The Monster attempts to communicate, manages only a
text: plaintive moan. The blind man stands.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: I cannot see you. I cannot see
dialog: anything. You must please excuse
dialog: me. But I am blind.
text: The Monster holds out his burned hands.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Come in, my poor friend. No one
dialog: will hurt you here. If you're in
dialog: trouble, perhaps I can help you.
text: The old man touches the Monster, who recoils with a
text: defensive growl.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Can you not speak? It's strange.
dialog: Perhaps you're afflicted too. I
dialog: cannot see and you cannot speak.

dialog: It's been a long time since any
dialog: human being came into this hut. I
dialog: shall look after you. And you will
dialog: comfort me.
text: On the tv screen, the old man starts to cry, then collapses
text: onto the Monster's chest. A thick tear rolls down the

speaker_heading: MONSTER
dialog: Friends.
speaker_heading: BLIND MAN
dialog: Before you came, I was all alone.

speaker_heading: MONSTER
dialog: Alone, bad. Friend, good.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Pretty cool. Better than most
dialog: monster movies.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I knew the guy who made it.
text: Michael glances skeptically at his father.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Come on, Dad. Is this another one
dialog: of your stories?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Here.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This is for real?
text: Clay nods. At the same time, his wife DANA appears in the
text: doorway. A pretty, cheerful woman in her mid-30s.
speaker_heading: DANA
text: The trash, Clay. Before it rains.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Okay.

speaker_heading: CLAY

scene_heading: EXT. CLAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Clay carries a large metal bin down the tidy lawn. The sky
text: momentarily brightens with a silent flash of lightning.
text: Clay gazes up at the electrical storm. He glances back at
text: his house, sees Dana cradling the baby in an upstairs
dialog: window.
text: The skies open with a shattering crash of thunder. Clay
text: tilts up his face, drinks in the cool rain. Then he extends
text: his arms and staggers along the sidewalk, imitating the
text: Monster's famous lurch.
text: We PULL BACK, revealing a sleepy neighborhood of small
text: houses and neat lawns, until Clay is only a small dot in the
dialog: landscape.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
