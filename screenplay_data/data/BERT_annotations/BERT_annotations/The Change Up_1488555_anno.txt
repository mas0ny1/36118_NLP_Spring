scene_heading: OPEN ON: PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS
text: Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then a second baby
text: joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear

speaker_heading: GROGGY MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

scene_heading: INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: DAVE LOCKWOOD, 30, bleary-eyed father of three, shuffles
text: through his well-appointed suburban home, passing a
text: grandfather clock reading 3:45. He stumbles over a TOY
text: GIRAFFE -- it SQUEAKS, and Dave sleepily mumbles:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Sorry Hank.
scene_heading: INT. NURSERY-- NIGHT
text: His eyes half-open, Dave changes the diaper of his very cute,
text: very insane nine month old daughter, SARAH, who screams and
text: pitches about her changing table.
speaker_heading: DAVE
scene_heading: PLEASE DON'T--
dialog: Honey, that's not--
dialog: Maybe if you--
text: She snatches a tin of baby powder and swings it about like a
text: mace, knocking over the diaper caddy, the wipes, the lotion --
text: and dispersing a cloud of white powder all over the nursery.
text: Blinded and SNEEZING, Dave manages to stay on point and
text: change the diaper like Van Damme at the end of Bloodsport.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can't-see ...must...persevere...
text: He finishes changing Sarah, places her back in her crib, then
text: picks up Sarah's twin brother, PETER, from his crib -- which
text: is good because he's been SLAMMING his head against the wall.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, buddy, we've talked about
dialog: the head thing--
text: Dave places Peter on the changing table and opens his diaper.
text: It's only wet, and Dave, pleasantly relieved, reaches for a
dialog: fresh diaper...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
text: Only Sarah has knocked the caddy all the way down the
dialog: changing table...
text: Holding down Peter with his left hand, Dave fully extends,
text: leaning waaay over, reaching for the diaper caddy...
text: It's just out of reach.. .he somehow stretches further...
text: It's only when Dave glances back that he realizes that his
text: head is now perfectly lined up with his son's QUIVERING ANUS.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no.
scene_heading: THE BABY'S BUTT-HOLE ERUPTS
text: with mustardy projectile stool, blasting Dave in the eyes,
text: nose and open mouth. Dave remains frozen, excrement dripping
text: down his face -- but, like a true dad, he does not let go of
text: his squirming child...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: Dave staggers down the hall, his hair white with baby powder,
text: his face covered in poo, and a twin in each arm SCREAMING
text: into each of his ears.
text: He soldiers on, stoic, an unsung hero in his time...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Juggling the twins in his arms, Dave wipes his face off with
text: paper towels and prepares two baby bottles -- nipples,
text: filters, defrosted breastmilk -- while the babies take turns
text: kicking him in the balls and SCREAMING.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Please, sweetheart, not my--
dialog: Honey, Daddy needs those--
scene_heading: INT. DEN -- NIGHT
text: Dave sits on his couch and positions the screaming, squirming
text: twins across his lap in an X pattern, plunks the bottles into
text: their mouths -- and instantly the twins settle down and slurp
text: away like perfect little angels.
text: Dave exhales. Whew. Then he reaches for the remote control
text: and turns on the TV. An old rerun of Magnum, P.I. is playing.
text: Dave watches, exhausted and expressionless.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
text: ON SCREEN, Tom Selleck, resplendent in mustache, corduroy
text: short shorts, and Hawaiian shirt, teaches a nubile CO-ED in a
text: scandalous bikini how to snorkel in beautiful sun-drenched
text: Waikiki. They're laughing and having a blast...
text: Dave watches, detached... Then his face starts to change...
speaker_heading: MAGNUM, P.I.
dialog: Is this the life you always dreamed
dialog: of?
text: Dave shakes his head, no, despair in his eyes...
text: ON TV, the co-ed nods, yes, and hungrily kisses Magnum...
text: Dave watches on with genuine existential longing... and soon a
text: tear falls from his eye. And then another.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Take me with you Magnum P. I...
text: Before long Dave is CRYING like a schoolgirl.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please take me with you...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)

speaker_heading: DAVE (V.0.)

scene_heading: INT. STEEL, KUHBACH, MCCLOUD -- LAW FIRM -- MORNING
text: Dave, in a conservative suit and clutching a massive coffee,
text: hurries down the hall with FLEMMING STEEL III, 50's, stiff,
text: humorless WASPY partner of this white shoe law firm.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Children are such a joy.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Aren't they? Yes. Always.
dialog: (to passing SECRETARY)
dialog: Good morning, Rebecca.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Any word on the Amalgamated merger?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: All but signed.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: And just in time for your partner
dialog: review no less.
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: (SMILING)
dialog: Really? I hadn't noticed.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: I look forward to having your antic
dialog: sense of humor in the partners'
dialog: suite, Lockwood. It can get a touch
dialog: dry up there.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Thank you, sir.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: (re: Dave's necktie knot)
dialog: But a double windsor? Come on, son,
dialog: this isn't the dog track.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No sir, absolutely not. So sorry.
text: Dave quickly undoes his tie as Flemming turns down a hallway.
text: SABRINA McARDLE, cute young paralegal, falls into step with
text: Dave, stymieing laughter.
speaker_heading: SABRINA MCARDLE
dialog: Really? The dog track?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Last week he told me my shoes were
dialog: "dangerously Italian."
speaker_heading: SABRINA MCARDLE
dialog: (laughing, handing him docs)
text: Amalgamated signing statements.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Thanks, Sabrina.
speaker_heading: SABRINA MCARDLE
dialog: Have a good one...
text: She smiles and breezes back down the hallway. Dave stops and
text: watches her go, lust in his eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
text: Then he hears TSK-TSK-TSK. He looks over at his mean old
text: secretary, GLADYS, 71, sitting at her desk.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: For shame, Mr. Lockwood! For shame!
dialog: You are a married man!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I have no idea what you're talking
dialog: about, Gladys...
text: Reddening, he snatches a huge pile of pink message slips and
text: hurries towards his office. She follows him, scolding:
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: With children.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yes, thank you, I almost forgot
dialog: about them for like two seconds...
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Dave enters his modest office; his phone is RINGING.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: The only thing that harlot needs to
text: put in her mouth is a sandwich.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Gladys, I'm a grown man, okay?
text: He angrily punches "SPEAKER" on his RINGING phone as he
text: reties his tie with a more traditional knot.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lockwood.
text: A shrill, horribly impersonated British accent fills Dave's
text: office -- as well as all of the surrounding offices.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
text: YES, MY DOUCHEBAG EXPLODED THIS
dialog: MORNING AND I'D LIKE TO SUE--!
text: As Gladys and various CO-WORKERS turn, shocked, Dave quickly
text: fumbles for the receiver and takes the call off speaker.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Jesus, Mitch, I'm at work--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON PHONE
text: WHO'S MITCH?! THIS IS MISS ELIZA
text: HAVERSHAM AND I AM THE VICTIM OF A
text: FAULTY BAG OF DOUCHE!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Dude, how stoned are you?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
text: MITCH PLANKO, 30, shirtless, Dodgers hat backwards, sitting
text: on a futon in his sparse white apartment, smoking a bong
text: shaped like a shotgun. Beat. He drops the horrible accent:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm pretty stoned.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come on, it's 10 in the morning.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, guess what? Great news.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: I found a futon on the street.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That is great news.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I sort of had to fight a bum for it
dialog: -- is that bad?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Kind of. Is there a reason you're
dialog: calling or--?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Are you gonna bitch out on tonight?
dialog: You are, aren't you.
text: Dave, half-listening, sits at his desk and answers emails.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Dodgers-Giants, dude! We haven't
dialog: missed one of these in like 20
dialog: years! Don't be a vajeen!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Dude, I'm coming--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You always do this! You never make
dialog: time for your friends anymore and
dialog: I'm sorry to be the one to tell you
dialog: this, but people are starting to
text: talk. Feelings are getting hurt.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Really? Whose feelings?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Not mine, because, like a samurai,
dialog: I have trained myself to feel
dialog: nothing except revenge and honor,
dialog: but other people -- nameless,
dialog: other, more sensitive people -- are
dialog: hurt, and they think you need to
dialog: treasure your friendships a little
dialog: bit more.
dialog: (exhaling massive bong rip)
dialog: How concerned should I be that my
dialog: new futon smells like death?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (distracted, typing)
dialog: Look, just, what time are you
dialog: picking me up tonight?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: If you bail I will rape you.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Dude, I get it, I'm coming--
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: In your eye. I will eye-rape you.
scene_heading: REPEATEDLY--
text: Just then there's a knock on Mitch's apartment door.
speaker_heading: VOICE AT HIS DOOR (V.0.)
dialog: Mitch?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Shit.
text: Mitch starts waving away the pot smoke.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Gotta go, pick you up at six--!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
text: STAY WITH MITCH as he quickly clicks off his iPhone, jams his
text: bong under the futon, opens the window, and tries to blow the
text: pot smoke out of his apartment with quick little PUFFS.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: One sec, Dad!
text: The smoke clears and Mitch jogs to the door and opens it to
text: reveal his father, MITCH, SR., 60's, friendly, in a suit,
text: holding a pile of mail.
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Hey, buddy! Your mailbox was
text: spilling over.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh thanks, I always forget.
text: They hug, and Mitch takes the mail and, without looking at
text: it, chucks it onto a HUGE PILE OF OLD MAIL in the corner.
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Were you smoking marijuana in here?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No! Honestly, it's my new futon, it
text: smells like illegal drugs.
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: We've talked about this, Mitch.
dialog: Smoke your grass on the balcony,
dialog: okay? It's just hard for me to tell
dialog: the other tenants they can't smoke
dialog: in their units when my own son is
dialog: blazing away in his, you know?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You got it, Dad.
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Oh hey, I saw your commercial on
dialog: channel 9 again last night...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Which one? "Give Gonorrhea The
dialog: Boot" or "Samir's Pet Shack Our Low
dialog: Low Prices Are Snake-sational?"
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Samir's Pet Shack. It's just a
dialog: shame you can't see your face in
dialog: that giant ape costume.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Actually, the real shame is that
dialog: Samir paid me in fucking organic
dialog: bird seed, but whatever...
text: He glares at several crates of BIRD SEED by the door.
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Well, your mother would've liked
dialog: it. She always loved animals...
speaker_heading: (AWKWARD MOMENT)
dialog: Anyway. I was just in the
dialog: neighborhood, wanted to check in.
dialog: How you doing, cash-wise?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm a little tight, actually, Pops.
dialog: Especially vis a vis, you know, the
dialog: whole bird seed situation.
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Five hundred?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Can you make it a grand?
text: Mitch's dad smiles to hide his disappointment and hands his
text: 30-year-old son a roll of hundred dollar bills.
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: You thought any more about coming
dialog: to work for me?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeeeah...I'm not really sure I'm a
dialog: "work" guy, you know what I mean?
dialog: Plus, I've been getting a ton of
dialog: auditions recently, so...
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Okay, well, my door is always open.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Thanks, pop. Bones.
text: Mitch, Sr. smiles and awkwardly bumps his son's fist.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Batting cages next weekend?
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Great! See you then.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
text: Mitch, Sr. smiles sadly and exits. Mitch BURPS and reaches
text: for his bong, having noticed none of his father's distress...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BRENTWOOD -- EVENING
text: ESTABLISHING SHOTS of Dave's beautiful colonial home. Huge
text: oak trees shade the lush front lawn. New Audi and BMW station
text: wagons sit in the driveway. We hear WATER SPLASHING...
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM -- EVENING
text: The twins sit in the bath, motionless, anticipatory...
speaker_heading: DAVE (V.0.)
scene_heading: .AND THEN THE BABY-EATING MONSTER
text: EMERGES FROM THE DEEP RAAWWWWR.
text: Dave rises up from beside the tub, arms upraised, soap suds
text: covering his face! The twins SCREAM and SPLASH, ecstatic!
text: Dave tries not to laugh, but he's having too much fun...
text: Behind Dave, his sweet daughter CARA, 5, sits on the closed
text: toilet lid in a ballet tutu, reading her BUTTERFLY BOOK.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Daddy daddy, which is your favorite
dialog: butterfly, the Southern Monarch or
dialog: the Many-Spotted Skipperling?
text: Dave glances at the book as he washes the twins.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh, I'm a Many-Spotted Skipperling
dialog: man all the way. The Southern
text: Monarch is just a glorified moth.
speaker_heading: CARA
speaker_heading: (VERY SERIOUS)
dialog: Yes. I tend to agree...
text: Dave smiles. Then his handsome wife JAMIE, 30's, blows into
text: the bathroom in a suit and starts removing her makeup.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What a day. Dr. Klein lost the
dialog: twins immunization record, the
dialog: wireless went down, and Cara got
text: bullied in ballet class again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Nicolette Peters keeps knocking me
text: over during the battement glisse.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, sugar-bug...
text: Dave looks genuinely concerned. Cara just shrugs and keeps
text: reading her butterfly book. Jamie whispers to him:
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: We need to remind her to keep
text: striving for verbal resolution.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Right, of course.
text: Jamie finally notices Dave's foam-covered face, and softens.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: And how was your day, monster man?
text: Before Dave can answer, the doorbell rings, DING-DONG! They
text: exchange the weary smile of parents who never see each other.
speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: He's early.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Of course he's early. All he does
dialog: all day is eat hummus and
text: masturbate.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE FRONT DOOR OPENING
text: to reveal MITCH in shades, fedora, and a Dodgers jersey.
text: Jamie, holding Cara, lets him in.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Whatup bitches!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Really?
text: He takes Cara and playfully -- and incredibly recklessly --
text: flips her in the air.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How's my favorite ballerina?!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I'm good! Are you coming to my
dialog: recital on Thursday?!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh no, honey, the only style of
dialog: dancing I support is exotic...
text: He plunks her on the floor and blows into
scene_heading: DAVE'S AMAZING KITCHEN
text: replete with granite counter tops, built-in appliances, fresh
text: flowers, and bowls teeming with fruit. Mitch beelines for the
text: Subzero fridge and opens it: it's stocked. His eyes alight.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Jesus Christ you could feed Africa
dialog: with this fridge...
text: As Jamie starts prepping a salad across the kitchen, Mitch
text: raids the fridge, packing his cargo pants with kid's snacks,
text: bagels, yogurts, juice boxes, everything.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: These leftovers from Morton's?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Oh no, hon, those are super old--
text: Too late -- Mitch is already eating the very old steak.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Chimichurri. score.
text: As Mitch chews, he eyes Jamie chopping vegetables.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: You look hot by the way, Jame.
text: Jamie laughs but clearly doesn't mind the flirtation.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Thanks... sort of...?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No really. I never would've guessed
dialog: twins.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Annnd that's probably enough--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Is Dave still meeting your needs
dialog: sexually?
text: Jamie just laughs, shaking her head, unbelievable.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, did I tell you I ran into Miss
dialog: Hickam last week at Starbucks?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Our old kindergarten teacher?!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah. She always liked Dave better
dialog: than me...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Honey, everyone likes Dave better
dialog: than you.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Fair enough. Anyway, I tried to get
dialog: her number, but she goes "I don't
dialog: date former students," so I go,
dialog: "great, do you fuck former
dialog: students?" and then she calls me a
dialog: "potty-mouth degenerate" and runs
dialog: out without her coffee. So I got a
dialog: free venti macchiato, which is cool-
speaker_heading: DAVE (O.S.)
text: Bathed, changed and in their Pis.
text: Mitch turns to see Dave in khakis and a buttondown, entering
text: the kitchen with the freshly bathed twins. Mitch grins:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Awww! Come to Uncle Mitch...
text: Dave hands the twins to Mitch, and they COO, impishly cute.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God, they smell like heaven
text: had sex with a dryer sheet.
dialog: (loudly to babies)
text: HI! WHAT'S YOUR NAME?! WHICH ONE
dialog: ARE YOU?!
speaker_heading: (they just GURGLE)
dialog: Why can't they talk yet? Are they
dialog: retarded or something?

dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: JAMIE
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: What?! No! They're fine!
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: Really? The one on the left looks a
dialog: little downsy.
speaker_heading: (JAMIE GASPS)
dialog: Kidding! Kidding.
dialog: (aside, to Dave)
dialog: A little bit though, right?
text: Ignoring him, Dave fastens the twins into their Bouncy Seats.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'll be back right after the game,
dialog: okay, Pumpkin?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Whenever. Have fun.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: See you, Jame!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Always a pleasure, Mitch.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: TWO BEERS POPPING OPEN
text: on the bottle cap-opener mounted on Mitch's dashboard...
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S CAR -- EVENING
text: Mitch offers Dave one of (his own) beers as they speed along
text: in his Fiero. Dave is reluctant.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, I'm good.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Really? You're going to make me
dialog: drink alone?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, well, you're driving, so...
text: Mitch shrugs and slides the spare beer into his chest pocket.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh, dude: great news.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You found another futon?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's awesome, because I'm made of
dialog: emotional Teflon and words can't
dialog: hurt me anymore. No: I auditioned
dialog: for a major movie role yesterday.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Nice. What movie?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It's called Busted Dreams 4. It's
text: about a renegade coroner who reads
dialog: minds named Jake Action. It's like
text: a sexy Mentalist.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Sounds cool.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, I read for the part of Steve
text: Action, Jake's troubled younger
dialog: brother with a secret, and I
dialog: fucking killed it. I cried like
dialog: five times during the audition and
dialog: it's a fucking action movie. Plus
dialog: I'm the spitting image of the dude
dialog: who plays Jake Action, so...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I hope you get it, man.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, it could be my Raging Bull.
dialog: Plus I'd get to kill a lot of
dialog: women, which is cool.
dialog: (offering him a joint)
dialog: Hotbox?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No, man, I got a big day tomorrow,
dialog: I can't get wasted tonight.

speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Change-up -- fuck he's good!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: He's no Fernando.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Of course not. Fernando is like The

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (toasting his beer)
dialog: TO FERNANDO!
speaker_heading: MITCH
scene_heading: FER--FUCKING--NANDO!
text: They sloppily drink -- when Dave suddenly remembers:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: OH! So finish your story! The girl
dialog: calls you up...?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Right! So she calls me up, it's
dialog: like 3 in the morning--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Tatiana.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Incredible. What's her last name?

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Is she hot? She is, right? Oh my

speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: (DISTURBED)
dialog: Maybe we should do this later...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: NO! Keep going! I need these
dialog: stories, man! They're all I have.
text: Mitch registers the desperation in his married friend's eyes.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Okay, well, you're in luck, because
dialog: Tatiana is stupid fucking hot.
text: Beautiful face, legs a mile long,
dialog: perfect ass, blonde hair, and
dialog: huuuge boobs.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh my God how big?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Double E.
speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Who's Sabrina?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This hot paralegal in my office.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Is she on your Cancer List?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What's a Cancer List?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Don't all married dudes have a
dialog: Cancer List? No? Like the first

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Just finish your story, man! I'm
dialog: dying over here!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Fine. So Tatiana's packing double
dialog: E's, which means like 20 plus
dialog: pounds of breastmeat -- yeah, it's
dialog: almost too much for one man to
dialog: handle. Thank God I'm the son of a
dialog: butcher and have strong hands and
text: wrists. Anyway, she walks in
dialog: wearing this tight black dress, and
dialog: you know what she says to me?
text: Dave shakes his head, on the edge of his bar stool.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Nothing. Because all Tatiana wants
dialog: to do at 3 in the morning is fucky
dialog: fucky rubber ducky!
text: Dave drunkenly slaps him ten, barely making hand-contact.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: And look, I'm not one to kiss and
dialog: tell...
dialog: (downing another shot)
dialog: but this chick is insatiable. She
dialog: wants it in every position:
dialog: Missionary, wheelbarrow, Reverse
dialog: Wheelbarrow, Assassin--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I don't even know what those are!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No one does! It gets so intense
dialog: that my nose starts bleeding. Yeah,
dialog: so I'm bleeding all over this chick
dialog: and she's fucking digging it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: It's like some weird Dracula Anne
dialog: Rice shit, and I'm fading in and
text: out of consciousness, and then,
text: when it's all over, she turns to me
dialog: and goes: "Tuesday night I'm coming
dialog: back and we're really going to
dialog: fuck."
text: Dave just stares at him, glassy-eyed, drunk, emotional.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That is maybe the single greatest
dialog: story I've ever heard in my life.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Ah, it's not always like that...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I don't know why...I don't know why
dialog: I've always been in such a rush,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: WHAT
speaker_heading: (BURRRRP)
dialog: do you mean?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You remember me in high school, I
dialog: was always so focussed on getting
dialog: into a good college, then when I
dialog: got to college, I was so focussed
dialog: on getting into a good law school,
dialog: then in law school I was just
dialog: trying to land a job at a good
dialog: firm, then Jamie and I got married
dialog: and we had Cara right away-- I just
dialog: feel like and I missed out on all
dialog: the fun stuff, you know? The sex,
dialog: the drugs, the bad choices, and now
dialog: it's too late. I blew it. I pissed
text: away my 20's, and now I'm staring
text: down the barrel a seriously boring
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh come on, Jamie is hot!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No, I know--
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I really want to have sex with her!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Wait, what?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: And your kids are adorable! They're
dialog: like fun little puppies that talk!
text: The bill comes. Dave pulls out a wad of cash, throws it on
text: the table, and stumbles for the door. Mitch lifts one of
text: Dave's twenties off the table and follows him out...
scene_heading: EXT. SPORTSBAR -- CONTINUOUS
text: They stumble down the dark Hollywood street together...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Don't get me wrong, I love my kids,
dialog: I do, I would take a bullet for
dialog: them, but...remember that heroin
dialog: addict you dated?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Tara? Or Rena? Or Rachel?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Jesus, how many heroin addicts have
dialog: you dated?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It's a national scourge, dude.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Anyway. Having kids is like dating
text: a heroin addict, only instead of
dialog: dating them, they move into your
dialog: house for 18 years. They're
text: laughing one second and crying the
dialog: next and then they're trying to
dialog: kill themselves in your bathroom
dialog: for no reason. They're mean and
dialog: selfish and they burn through all
dialog: your money and they steal your shit
dialog: and they break everything and they
dialog: stay up all night and they listen
dialog: to really shitty music and the
dialog: dirty secret is, no one actually
dialog: likes kids.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh come on, you don't mean that--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No! It's true. Everyone pretends to
dialog: like kids because if you don't you
dialog: look like a huge dick. It's like
dialog: Drew Barrymore or jazz. No one
dialog: actually likes them, but if you say
dialog: that out loud, everybody hates you.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, I love Drew Barrymore -- have
dialog: you seen Boys on the Side?
text: They weave across a LARGE PLAZA, stumbling for Mitch's car.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm just saying: don't fuck up your
dialog: life like I did, okay?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What are you talking about? You've
dialog: got it all! You've got a huge house
dialog: full of food and furniture -- shit,
dialog: your TV is bigger than my car! You
dialog: have a great job, you make a shit-
dialog: ton of money, and people respect
dialog: you, man! My last job involved an
dialog: ape costume -- do you know what
dialog: that does to a man?
text: Dave waves him off, not really hearing him. But Mitch is
dialog: sincere, heartfelt:
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Plus you've got a hot, extremely
dialog: fuckable wife who cooks and cleans
dialog: and takes care of all your needs!
dialog: It's like having a really hot mom
dialog: who you can also have sex with!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Wait, what--?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Also you're never lonely, you
dialog: always have someone to talk to
dialog: about your day, plus you get to do
dialog: all the fun gay couple stuff like
dialog: go to wine country! You think
dialog: single guys can go to wine
dialog: country?! No way! They won't even
dialog: let us in! You're living the dream,
dialog: dude! What more do you want?!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Tatiana! I want Tatiana! I want sex
dialog: with strange new women and maybe
dialog: also with Sabrina if she's single
dialog: and I want to wake up at noon and
dialog: smoke weed all afternoon and I want
dialog: to not think about the needs of
dialog: four other people 24 hours a day
dialog: and I want to start reading a novel
dialog: and actually finish it and I want
dialog: to take a solid shit because I'm
dialog: not constantly stressed out and I
dialog: want to learn how to rollerblade
dialog: and also I really want to pee...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, me too...
text: They look around the plaza, and their eyes land on the HUGE
text: FOUNTAIN in the middle; a GREEK GODDESS sits atop it.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Fountain?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Bingo.
text: They stumble over to the fountain, unzip their pants, and,
text: leaning on each other, begin peeing into it. Mitch glances up
text: at the GREEK GODDESS METIS. She scowls down at them.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: This chick does not look happy.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Maybe she has three kids and a job
dialog: she hates.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, enough already.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm just saying...I envy your life.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: And that's what's so fucked,
dialog: because I envy yours.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah you don't--
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I do!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No, I do--!
speaker_heading: MITCH DAVE
dialog: I wish I had your life! I wish I had your life!
dialog: They're about to say "jinx" when--
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: A thunder clap CRASHES and
scene_heading: ALL OVER LOS ANGELES
text: the electrical grid starts shutting down, neighborhood by
text: neighborhood! Soon the entire city is PITCH BLACK...
text: BACK IN THE DARKENED PLAZA
text: Dave and Mitch freeze, terrified, hugging. . .and peeing...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Ummmmm...?
text: Then all the lights in the city flicker back to life...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: R-Rolling blackout?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I guess...?
text: They continue peeing, a little freaked out.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You really have nice flow by the
text: way. Very thick and confident.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Thank you. Yours is very steamy.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Thank you. My urologist says I run
text: a little warm.
text: Eventually they both finish, tuck in, and zip up. Beat.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: You good to drive?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Now I am.

text: As they stumble off towards Mitch's Fiero, HOLD ON the statue
text: of Metis, the shape-shifting Greek Goddess of Wisdom...
text: It almost looks like she's smiling...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
text: It's a beautiful sunny Los Angeles morning. The silhouette of
text: a body lies in Dave's bed, SNORING away. Then we hear
text: THE TWINS CRYING
text: followed by what is unequivocally Mitch's patter -- and his
scene_heading: FAMILY-FRIENDLY LANGUAGE:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Whose fucking baby is that...?
text: A hand emerges and fumbles on the night stand.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: And where the fuck is my bong?
text: He groggily rises from the sheets -- only it's not Mitch.
text: It's Dave. His body, his face, everything.
dialog: Yup, you got it: the single auy and the married guy have
dialog: switched bodies. We will refer to them by their "brain
dialog: names," thus while this hungover dude definitely looks like
dialog: Dave, inside he's Mitch, so that's what we'll call him. The
text: actors, of course, will remain in their bodies.
text: Mitch doesn't know any of this yet.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are there so many fucking
dialog: pillows...?
text: He rolls over to see Jamie, sitting up in bed, pulling her
text: breasts out of her tank top, getting ready to nurse the
text: twins. Mitch launches out of bed, suddenly very awake.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
text: WHOA! WHOA! WHAT THE FUCK, JAME?!
text: She starts breast-feeding the babies, confused.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What? What's your problem?
text: Mitch shields his eyes with his hands, shocked and disgusted.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh my god that is so gross! Put
dialog: your tits away! This isn't Europe!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Mitch finally notices he's in DAVE'S BEDROOM...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Wait: why am I in...? Did I sleep
dialog: here last night?!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Um, yeah?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Did we...?!
text: Panicked, he thrusts his fist like, have sex?!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Are you insane?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So why the hell did I wake up in
dialog: your bed?!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Are you still drunk?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Look, just, where's Dave?!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Where's fucking Dave?!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Dave is right here! You're Dave!
text: He turns and sees himself in the mirror. Freezes. He is Dave.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh my God... Oh my God...
text: He slowly touches his new face...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm a fucking tool.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
text: A body lies sprawled on Mitch's futon, out cold. INSANE
text: POUNDING on the door shatters the silence.
speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.)
scene_heading: OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR IMMEDIATELY!
text: The body sits up, groggy and confused -- it is, of course,
text: Dave in Mitch's body. While he looks like Mitch, he moves,
text: talks, and even shuffles to the door exactly like Dave...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Mitch...?
speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.)
dialog: Fucking open the fucking door!
text: Dave stops, noticing that he's in Mitch's empty apartment.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Why am I in your sad apartment--
speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.)
dialog: The door, dude! Open the door!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Fine, Jesus, relax--
text: Dave opens the door to see himself standing there.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the fuck is this...?
text: Dave backpedals, terrified, as Mitch blows inside, furious.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I knew it!
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: (FREAKING OUT)
dialog: Who the hell are you?! And why do
dialog: you look like me?!
text: Mitch angles Dave over to the mirror on the otherwise barren
text: wall-and Dave sees he's in Mitch's body... Stunned, he
text: slowly touches his new face... his new hair. . .his new body...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I know, dude.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm a fucking loser...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Wait, what?
text: Dave spins, completely awake now:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: How the fuck did this happen?!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How should I know?! Has this ever
dialog: happened to you before?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What, switching bodies with another
dialog: human being?! Oh yeah, this shit
dialog: happens to me like twice a week!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Well...I don't want to be you!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh, you don't want to be me?! No,
dialog: no, no: I don't want to be you!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Look, let's just.. .think. How could
dialog: this have possibly happened...?
text: They pace about the apartment, trying to think... Then:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Bingo. Got it. We're dreaming.
text: Dave grabs Mitch's nipple and twists it hard.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow ow ow, fuck!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Not dreaming.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: First of all, you're a penis.
dialog: Second of all--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Wait, what'd you just say?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I called you a penis and--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (running out the door)
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S AUDI STATION WAGON -- MORNING
text: Dave speeds through morning traffic in his Audi station
text: wagon, leaning on the HORN. Mitch sits shotgun, confused.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Remember last night when we peed
dialog: into that fountain?! As we peed, we
dialog: wished we had each other's lives!
speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: (REMEMBERING)
dialog: Oh fuck.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Our wishes must've... somehow... come
dialog: true.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I thought wishes came true when you
text: threw a coin into a fountain...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well apparently urine works too.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's bullshit! I would've wished
dialog: for something way cooler!
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD -- MORNING
text: Unable to find a parking spot, Mitch and Dave double-park on
text: Hollywood Boulevard, hop out, and sprint for the plaza...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What are we gonna do when we get to
dialog: the fountain?!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: We're gonna hug each other and pee
dialog: into the fountain and wish our
dialog: lives back!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That might sound really gay!
text: Both men race around the corner onto the plaza and stop cold:
text: THE FOUNTAIN IS GONE
text: A DEPARTMENT OF PARKS CREW is cleaning up the site where it
text: once sat. Mitch and Dave are blown away.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!
text: They hurry up to the crew FOREMAN.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Excuse me! Where is the fountain?!
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
text: It's getting restored.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Where did you take it?!
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: I don't know, chief, I'm not the
dialog: fountain spokesman, I'm just the
dialog: guy that fills the fucking hole.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Who could tell us where it is?!
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: Maybe the district manager?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A DESK PLACARD READING "DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON"
text: District Manager CARLA NELSON sits behind her desk in her

scene_heading: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
text: It's not in the computer.
text: Opposite her, Dave and Mitch pull their hair out, insane.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Well of course it's not--!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: When will it be in the computer?!
scene_heading: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
dialog: You could try calling tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Tomorrow?! We can't wait until
dialog: tomorrow, Carla!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How can you lose a fountain?.
scene_heading: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
dialog: (beat, deadpan)
text: It's not in the computer.
text: Mitch LUNGES for Carla, but Dave grabs him and wrestles him
text: out of the office.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: YOU ARE EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG
dialog: WITH THE WORLD--!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: We'll call you tomorrow! Thank you!
scene_heading: EXT. DEPARTMENT OF PARKS BUILDING -- DAY
text: Dave and Mitch exit the Department of Parks building and pace
text: on the sunny sidewalk, their hands on their heads, stunned.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: This is so fucked...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: We should just go home and lock the
scene_heading: DOORS AND--
text: Mitch's phone rings in Dave's pocket. Dave hesitates, then
text: answers it, fruitlessly trying to sound like Mitch:
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is fucking Mitch?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't talk like that, dude--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Okay ...Okay...Great...Thank you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
text: Dave clicks off.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Marty Green, the producer of Busted
dialog: Dreams 4. Apparently the guy they
dialog: cast for Steve Action OD'd last
dialog: night, and the back-up actor got
dialog: deported, so, alphabetically,
dialog: you're the next actor on the list.
dialog: You got the part, man.
text: Mitch covers his mouth like he just won American Idol.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh my God! Oh my God! Dreams really
dialog: do come true--!
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: Wait, no, this sucks! I'm stuck in
dialog: your fat dad-body! I can't play
dialog: Steve Action looking like this!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (remembering, stunned)
dialog: Oh my God: and I've got my closing
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What, is that like a big deal?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: A big--?! Yeah! Whether or not I
dialog: make partner is riding on this!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So what the hell are we gonna do?
text: PANICKED SILENCE. Then Mitch looks at Dave...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No. No. We can't just be each other
dialog: for a day, Mitch! You have no idea
dialog: how to be a lawyer!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, I'm an actor, a human
dialog: chameleon, I can do lawyer in my
dialog: fucking sleep! It's you I'm worried
dialog: about: you can't act for shit!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: First of all, it's Busted Dreams 4,
dialog: okay? It's not The Reader. Second
dialog: of all, I'm a WASP, I've spent my
dialog: entire life acting happy and no one
dialog: has ever questioned my performance,
dialog: okay?!
text: They look at each other, cooling off a bit...
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Are...Are we actually considering
dialog: doing this...?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I mean, we have to...right?
text: Both men look highly anxious. Dave glances at the time.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: All right, well, my meeting starts
dialog: in 45 minutes. You need to race
dialog: home, get dressed, then go to my
dialog: office and find my secretary Gladys-
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: She sounds hot, is she hot?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No. Get the merger docs from Gladys
dialog: and take them to the conference
dialog: room. All the partners will be
dialog: there so do not speak to anyone.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Really? Because I can vamp--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: NO! No vamping! And once the
dialog: meeting starts, you will continue
dialog: to say nothing. When a partner asks
dialog: you for the merger documents, you
dialog: will silently hand them over, okay?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, I get it. Play it big, but
dialog: maintain my reality--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No! Play it small. Really small.
dialog: I've spent the last nine months
dialog: banging out the terms of this deal,
dialog: all you have to do is hand over the
dialog: documents. That's it.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, that's easy as fuck. Okay,
dialog: for me, go home, put on some cool
dialog: clothes, and get to set -- all the
dialog: info is on my phone. Once you're
dialog: there, go to Hair &amp; Makeup and
dialog: memorize your lines and try not to
dialog: be a total douche to everyone,
dialog: okay? This is the film industry.
dialog: Everyone is really cool.
text: They look at each other, very doubtful that this will work...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm trusting you, dude...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm trusting you, too...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Power hug.
text: They hug tight then release.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh hey, you also need to pick up
dialog: Cara from ballet at 4, okay?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (heads for the car)
dialog: I'm so fucking all over that shit.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STEEL, KUHBACH, MCCLOUD -- LAW FIRM -- MORNING
text: Mitch blows into Dave's stodgy law firm looking like a lawyer
text: -- from a Ralph Lauren ad: he sports a pink buttondown, red
text: suspenders, a blue crested blazer, khakis, no socks, black
text: and white wingtips, and slicked-back hair.
text: He also affects a preposterous patrician accent like John
dialog: Kerry or any white guy on a black sitcom.

speaker_heading: MITCH
text: GOOD MORNING, ONE AND ALL! WHAT A

speaker_heading: ATTORNEY!

speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: What in God's name are you wearing?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Holy dick, are you Gladys? You're a
dialog: lynx.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: W-What is a lynx?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: A white-haired cougar. You really
dialog: should dress sexier, though. The
dialog: whole angry prison nurse thing is a
dialog: huge mistake.
text: Gladys GASPS and jams some documents into his hands.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Here are your merger documents!
dialog: Good day to you!
text: She storms off. Mitch calls after her:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hey, where's my meeting at?
text: She angrily points at a conference room as she stalks off.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The conference room is full of EXECUTIVES from KINKABE
text: TECHNOLOGIES and AMALGAMATED INDUSTRIES, as well as several
text: well-heeled LAWYERS. They chat amiably until
speaker_heading: MITCH ENTERS
text: in his ridiculous outfit. The room goes silent, but Mitch's
text: confidence remains sky-high:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What up, white people?! Republican
dialog: Party in the house, am I right?!
dialog: Come on, let's get started!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
text: Everyone looks a bit confused by this Nobody telling them
text: what to do, but nonetheless, they begin taking their seats.
text: Mitch goes around, introducing himself.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Dave Lockwood, thanks for coming!
dialog: Dave Lockwood, I did all the work!
dialog: Dave Lockwood-san, konichi-wa!
dialog: (to the room)
dialog: Anyone need anything? Mimosa, spicy
dialog: tuna roll? No? We're good? All
dialog: right, guys, take it away!
text: Mitch takes one of the last open seats -- at the head of the
text: conference table. It's clearly in his boss's seat. Flemming
text: Steel III hovers awkwardly.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Yes, well, thank you, Dave...?
dialog: (clearing his throat)
dialog: We are gathered here today to
dialog: codify the marriage of two bold

scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: B-Before we sign on the proverbial
dialog: bottom line, are there any
dialog: outstanding questions or concerns
dialog: that we might address? Ask now or
dialog: forever hold your peace...
text: Pleasant CHUCKLES in the room. Then the Japanese-American CEO
text: of Kinkabe Technologies, KEN KINKABE, 60's, raises his hand.
speaker_heading: CEO KEN KINKABE
dialog: We just wanted to make sure that
scene_heading: THE DEBT-TO-PROJECTED-AMORTIZATION
dialog: ratios haven't changed given the
dialog: recent market fluctuations.
text: Everyone turns to Mitch. Who's not listening. He's drawing
text: pictures of boobs on a yellow legal pad.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Dave?
text: Mitch looks up, sees everyone looking at him.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Right, my bad--
text: Thinking that's his cue, he slides Flemming the documents.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: No, Dave. Mr. Kinkabe had a
dialog: question about the DPA ratios.
text: Deer in headlights.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Okay?
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Well? How are they?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: G-Good?
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Good?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Bad? Bad! They're fucking terrible.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Dave!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Look, everything's cool, let's just
dialog: sign this fucking thing and go
dialog: party! We're all rich, who cares?!
text: Mr. Kinkabe angrily jabs his finger at the incredibly short
text: CEO of Amalgamated Industries, TED NORTON, 60's.
speaker_heading: CEO KEN KINKABE
dialog: I knew it! You were never serious
dialog: about this merger!
speaker_heading: CEO TED NORTON
dialog: Spare me, Ken, you were just trying
dialog: to inflate your share price!
speaker_heading: CEO KEN KINKABE
dialog: This merger is over! I will see you
dialog: in court!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CEO TED NORTON
dialog: Not if we see you first, you prick!
text: The execs furiously race out of the conference room, all of
text: them reaching for their cell phones. War has been declared.
text: The lawyers hurry after the clients, fruitlessly trying to
text: coax them back to the table.
text: Mitch frowns, oo, and tiptoes for the exit.. .until Flemming
text: Steel III grabs his arm, furious.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Right now you need to give me one
dialog: reason not to fire you.
text: Mitch stammers, oh shit.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Relax, dude ... this-this is all
dialog: part of my master plan.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: It is.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes! Check it out: if we drag this
dialog: out...we make more money, right?
dialog: Don't we? Of course we do! And then
dialog: we can bill the fuck out of them!
dialog: Some of them don't even speak-ah
dialog: the engrish so goo, you know what
dialog: I'm saying?
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: That's your plan.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes...? Is it...? It's not a very
dialog: good plan, is it.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Son, what you've just said to me is
dialog: highly illegal. You could go to
dialog: jail for a very long time just for
dialog: suggesting it...
speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: (SWEATING)
dialog: We're lawyers! We're above the law!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: I must say, I've never seen this
dialog: side of you before, Lockwood. I
dialog: always thought you were on the
dialog: straight and narrow...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Fuck that, ese. I'm straight up
text: gangster all the way through.
text: Flemming eyes him, determining his fate. Mitch can't breathe.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Fine, I'll roll the dice with you
dialog: But if word of this gets out, I
dialog: will throw you under the bus so
dialog: darn fast you won't know what hit
dialog: you. Now go put on some proper
dialog: clothes. You look like Joe Pesci.
text: Flemming Steel III hurries off. Mitch exhales, holy shit...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VAN NUYS -- RANCH HOUSE -- DAY
text: Dave nervously pulls up to a RANCH HOUSE in the Fiero,
text: reading the address off his iPhone. Several crew trucks are
text: parked out front, and PA's with headsets loiter about.
text: Dave gets out wearing an ironed buttondown shirt tucked into
text: khakis. He self-consciously untucks half his shirt, trying to
text: look "cooler," as he approaches a nearby P.A.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yo, Mitch Planko is here. Where the
dialog: fuck is Hair &amp; Makeup?
dialog: P.A.
speaker_heading: (POINTING)
dialog: Um, trailer 3.. ?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That's so real.
text: Dave stiffly walks off as the P.A. eyes him, weirded out.
scene_heading: INT. HAIR &amp; MAKEUP TRAILER -- DAY
text: Dave, now in leather pants, the top four buttons of his shirt
text: undone, sits in the makeup chair, getting his hair styled. He
text: studies the script, confused. Then a P.A. hurries in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
dialog: P.A.
dialog: I'm here to take you to set. Is
dialog: there anything I can get you?
dialog: Vitamin water, Pelegrino?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No thanks. Hey, what does it mean
dialog: when it says T.S., or B.T.S.?
dialog: P.A.
text: Titty Shot and Bouncing Titty Shot.
speaker_heading: (TO HEADSET)
text: Steve Action is coming to set.
text: Dave, alarmed, follows the P.A. out and
text: THROUGH THE LOW BUDGET SET
dialog: They've taken over this valley ranch house; cables, lights
text: and sound equipment run everywhere.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Wait! W-what kind of movie is
dialog: this?!
dialog: P.A.
dialog: It's a lorno.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I-I'm not familiar with that genre.
dialog: P.A.
dialog: Lorno? Light porno? Tits &amp; shadows?
dialog: You ever hear of Skinemax?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh no.
dialog: They arrive in
scene_heading: AN ORNATE BEDROOM
text: bedecked with cameras, grip equipment -- and thousands of lit
text: candles. The P.A. unbuttons Dave's shirt even further and
text: starts smearing his chest and face with Crisco oil.
text: Just then, the fat balding director, VALTAN -- just Valtan --
text: from some ethnically cleansed Balkan state, 50's, blows in.
speaker_heading: VALTAN
dialog: More oil! Make him shiny like fish!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Excuse me, are you in charge here?
dialog: I think there's been some sort of
speaker_heading: MISTAKE--
speaker_heading: VALTAN
dialog: Mona! Where Mona?!
text: And then MONA -- aging actress with fake boobs -- teeters in
text: wearing a flimsy nightgown and six inch heels.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: I'm here!
speaker_heading: VALTAN
dialog: Okay guys, here scene: Mitch, you
dialog: enter with gun -- where gun?!
text: A P.A. runs in with a huge MACHINE GUN WITH ROCKET LAUNCHER
text: ATTACHMENT and gives it to Dave, who takes it limply...
speaker_heading: VALTAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Guard try to stop you, line-line-
dialog: line, knock him the fuck out, you
dialog: see Mona asleep in bed, you wake
dialog: her up and start fuck time, okay?
text: Dave stammers, his head spinning.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: What's my motivation?
speaker_heading: VALTAN
dialog: Your motivation? Your motivation is
dialog: show big tit to business traveler
text: in hotel room too scared to order
dialog: real porno, okay?
dialog: (blocking the scene)
dialog: Okay, here shot list: start makeout
text: here, nightgown fall, close-up of
text: titty, candles burning, bouncing
text: titty close-up, moaning, fake sex-
text: in-mouth obscured by hair, more
dialog: candle, fake backdoor sex obscured
dialog: by blowing curtain, more candle,
text: her buttock, his buttock, wind blow
dialog: out candle and finito, okay?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: It's like a poem.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: VALTAN
dialog: I know, baby, I crush this shit big
dialog: time. Let's lock it up!
dialog: P. A.
dialog: Locking it up!
text: As the crew bustle about, Mona turns to a shell-shocked Dave.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: You wanna bump?
text: Mona snorts a fingernail of coke into her nose.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: A bump--? Of drugs?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: You're cute. But if you try to
dialog: actually fuck me I'll set your dick
dialog: on fire with one of these fucking
dialog: candles, y'understand me?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Is this actually happening?
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Pound away on my upper thigh all
dialog: you want, that's what it's there
dialog: for, okay? And no, you can't pay me
dialog: to give you a real BJ, I don't do
dialog: that shit anymore.
text: Dave's mouth opens, but nothing comes out. A P.A. guides him
text: out of the room. He's still in a trance...
speaker_heading: VALTAN
speaker_heading: ANNNND ACTION:
text: Dave stands there, frozen. Behind the camera, Valtan
text: gestures, go! Dave stumbles into the bedroom, holding the
text: huge machine gun like, well, like a corporate lawyer.
text: A BLOW-DRIED GOON appears with a gun.
scene_heading: BLOW-DRIED GOON
dialog: No entry!
text: Dave looks around at the bright lights, the camera, the crew
text: watching him -- and he freezes up. The goon tries again:
speaker_heading: BLOWDRIED GOON
dialog: I said: No entry!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
text: Then Dave sees a P.A. waving at him, holding up a huge board
text: with his lines written on them. Shielding his eyes from the
text: lights, Dave reads his lines, monotone:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: If you let me don't in...don't let
dialog: me in...If you don't let me in,
dialog: Paco, I will fuck you dead. That
dialog: doesn't sound right. If you don't
dialog: let me Taco-- is his name Paco or
dialog: Taco? Your penmanship is illegible--
speaker_heading: VALTAN
dialog: Fuck it, we fix in post! Just knock
dialog: out guard, wake up girl, and make
dialog: fuck time! Keep rolling!
dialog: P.A.
dialog: Still rolling!
text: Dave very effeminately "karate chops" the goon in the neck
text: once, and the guy dramatically throws himself against the
text: wall and drops, unconscious. Then Dave crosses and pretends
text: to suddenly see Mona in the bed. His acting is atrocious.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh my goodness it is Lola my long
dialog: lost lover Lola who...I love. Her.
speaker_heading: VALTAN
dialog: More sexy! Too stiff! Annnd Mona
dialog: wake up, surprised!
text: Mona, not much of a better actor than Dave, wakes up -- and
text: SCREAMS deafeningly, like some 1950's horror queen.
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: (COVERING EARS)
scene_heading: HOLY SHIT--
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Steve Action?! You perfect bastard!
speaker_heading: VALTAN
dialog: And now kiss her like savage!
text: Dave, totally grossed out by her, very reluctantly leans in
text: for the kiss. Just before their lips meet, he pulls away.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm sorry! I can't!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: VALTAN
text: CUT! CUT.
speaker_heading: (BEYOND PISSED)
dialog: What the fuck, man?! She ready for
dialog: first class trip to fuck town!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Look, I can't, I'm married.
speaker_heading: VALTAN
dialog: No no no, Steve Action throw wife
text: off cliff in last scene.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No, I mean, me, in real life. I'm
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: VALTAN
dialog: So am I! Mona my wife! Yeah, how
dialog: stupid is that shit, man?! Now go
dialog: fake-fuck my wife before owners of
dialog: house come back from ski vacation
dialog: to find film crew in master
dialog: bedroom!
text: Dave just stands there, hopelessly out of place...
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
text: MITCH LOOKING EQUALLY OUT OF PLACE
text: standing in the back of an auditorium as on stage, two dozen
text: 5 year old GIRLS in tutus prance about, rehearsing a ballet.
text: The teacher, MRS. KLEINMAN, fruitlessly tries to direct them.
text: CAMERA FINDS CARA onstage, twirling around -- until a bigger
text: girl, NICOLETTE PETERS, knocks her over. Mrs. Kleinman turns
text: to see Cara splayed out on the ground, trying not to cry.
scene_heading: BALLET TEACHER
dialog: Oh Cara, do try to stay on your
dialog: toes! Let's start again...
text: In the audience, Mitch straightens: what was that...?
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S AUDI STATION WAGON -- DAY
text: Mitch drives Cara home from ballet. She sits shotgun in her
text: tutu, looking small and sad.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Shouldn't I be sitting in my
dialog: carseat?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Whatever, you're fine -- hey,
dialog: what's up with that little blonde
dialog: bitch who knocked you over?
text: She looks a little surprised by her dad's language.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: That's Nicolette Peters. She does
dialog: that a lot, actually...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So why don't you fight back?
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Um, because you told me not to? You
dialog: said I should strive for verbal
dialog: resolution.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Fuck verbal resolution! Put that
dialog: whore on her back and shank her! Do
dialog: you know how to make a shiv?
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: What?
text: Mitch lights a cigarette with the car lighter.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Listen to me, kid: the world is a
text: cesspool of cruelty and violence.
dialog: If someone comes at you with a
dialog: knife, you gotta put their entire
dialog: fucking family in the morgue, okay?
dialog: That's called jailyard justice.
dialog: Because if you don't come back hard
dialog: on a bitch, your ass is gonna get
text: sold for a pack of Camel Lights and
dialog: a jello cup, y'understand? Always
dialog: solve your problems with violence.
dialog: Always.
text: Cara nods, alarmed.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: O-Okay Daddy...?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: DAVE LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA
text: He's sitting at a booth in a bar, highly traumatized.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I dry-humped a stranger's leg for
dialog: three hours today...
text: Sitting opposite him, Mitch downs a shot, exhausted.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Cry me a river, dude: I dealt with
dialog: ballet and your ass-hat boss today.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh no -- what happened at work?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Nothing! Nothing.
dialog: (off Dave's look)
dialog: I fixed it.
dialog: (off Dave's look)
dialog: Okay, but look, it was not my
dialog: fault! The Japs started peppering
dialog: me with questions and I had to
dialog: improvise and then everyone got
dialog: very emotional and, well... it looks
dialog: like we're going to court.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh my God tell me you're kidding.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, your boss was pretty miffed,
dialog: but then I told him this was all
dialog: part of my master plan to make more
dialog: money off our clients--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What. 1
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, turns out that's totally
dialog: illegal, but the old man was
dialog: surprisingly cool about it.
text: Dave sits there, speechless. Mitch eats wings.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, your secretary is sort of hot
dialog: in like a Dame Judi Dench-playing-a-
dialog: Nazi kind of way. Is she on the
dialog: fuck team?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: (WEAK)
dialog: I. .I just want to go home...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: DAVE AND MITCH DRIVING IN MITCH'S CAR
text: as the sun sets. The windows are open and the wind is in
text: their hair. They're very much not talking to each other...
scene_heading: EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- EVENING
text: Dave and Mitch head up Dave's front walk, solemn...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What are you gonna tell Jamie?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: The truth.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Can I highly recommend against
dialog: that?
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S HOUSE -- EVENING
text: Mitch and Dave enter to find Cara running down the stairs in
text: her Dora the Explorer pajamas. Dave smiles and opens his
text: arms, tired and overjoyed to see her...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey, sugar-bug.
text: .but she passes right by him and hugs Mitch.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Hi Daddy!
text: Dave stammers, stung. Mitch hugs her, acting stiff like Dave.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Well hello, my precocious daughter!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Okay, I don't sound like that--
text: Just then Jamie hurries past, the twins in her arms, and
text: kisses Mitch on the lips. Both men startle a bit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: (TO DAVE)
dialog: Hi Mitch.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This is so weird.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: You staying for dinner?
text: Silence. Then Mitch nudges Dave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Right -- no, thank you. I'm-- Look,
dialog: Jamie, we really need to talk.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Okay, but make it quick, I've got
dialog: to put the twins to bed.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I. .um...I'm not Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm Mitch. Somehow.. .we switched
dialog: bodies last night. He's Dave.
text: Jamie looks back and forth between them, expressionless.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: You see, what happened was, we peed
dialog: into a magic fountain--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Then the city moved the fountain--
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: But as soon as they find it, we're
dialog: going to switch back.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Great! Sounds like a plan.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Are you kidding? Is she kidding?
text: Clearly yes. Jamie heads for the stairs when Dave stops her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Baby, please don't--
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Okay, Mitch, first of all, don't
dialog: call me baby, it's creepy. Second
dialog: of all... what the hell are you
dialog: talking about?.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Look, I can prove it's true! Just,
dialog: I don't know, just ask me anything
dialog: that only I -- that only Dave --
dialog: would know. Anything.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: When's our wedding anniversary?
dialog: Dave freezes, oh shit.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Spring?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Spring?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, it's March 24th, even I know
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Why do you know that?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So that I can send you a thoughtful
dialog: card -- what kind of monster are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Look, just ask me anything else.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I really don't have time to--
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Jamie, please.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What's my favorite color?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You have a favorite color?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Mauve.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Dude: do you not understand what
dialog: we're trying to accomplish here?!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm just saying, look at all the
dialog: accents in this room -- she loves
text: mauve.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Baby -- Jamie -- ask me anything
dialog: else, something more personal...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Fine, what did we talk about two
dialog: nights ago...? I was crying...?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (taking a stab in the dark)
dialog: Yourrrrr mother maybe?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: That's great, Mitch. Thanks a big
dialog: bunch. Come on, honey.
text: Jamie steams upstairs, pissed, with Cara in tow. Dave runs
text: his hands through his hair, fuck! Mitch looks appalled:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, you are like the worst
dialog: husband ever.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I have a lot on my plate right now,
dialog: man! You have no idea!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Okay, look, calm down: I can hold
dialog: down the fort for one night.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Are you joking? You worked at my
dialog: job for one day and you almost got
dialog: arrested! What are you gonna do to
dialog: my family?!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, the kids are already going to
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I can handle watching Two
dialog: And A Half fucking Men and falling
text: asleep on the couch with the best
dialog: of 'em. The only roadblock I
dialog: foresee is: what do I tell Jamie?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What do you tell Jamie.. .when?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: When she wants to have sex tonight.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But it's Tuesday.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't understand. You don't have
dialog: sex on Tuesdays?
text: A beat. Then Dave starts LAUGHING. It builds. Dave hasn't
text: laughed this hard in a long time. He pats Mitch's cheek.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That's adorable.
text: Dave turns and exits the house, still LAUGHING...
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what, give it a shot.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Really?! You want me to bang your
dialog: wife??
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Sure, have at it! Let me know how
dialog: it goes...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: Dave parks Mitch's Fiero on this shady Silver Lake street,
text: glancing at the HOMELESS GUY stumbling by, a bit scared.
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: Dave enters Mitch's apartment and flips on the bright
text: overhead light. The white walls are empty. A futon, TV, and
text: four crates of bird seed are all that occupy the living room.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Jesus, it's like a Swedish asylum--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
text: And then Mitch's iPhone RINGS. Dave hesitates, then answers:
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mitch Planko, who the fuck is this?
text: A sexy woman's voice purrs:
speaker_heading: SEXY WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Hiii Mitch, it's Tatiana...
dialog: Dave straightens, oh shit!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Tatiana?! Hi! How, um, how are you?
speaker_heading: TATIANA (O.S.)
dialog: I'll be better in a few minutes
dialog: after I fuck you raw.
text: CLICK. She hangs up. Dave freezes, wide-eyed.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God.
text: He quickly dials a number.
text: INTERCUT WITH MITCH
text: Sitting on the plush couch with Jamie, eating takeout sushi
text: and watching Two and a Half Men on the huge plasma TV.
text: The phone rings. Mitch sees the caller ID, then answers it.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hey dude, I take back everything I
dialog: said about Two and a Half Men. This
dialog: is some edgy shit--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Tatiana is on her way over!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What do you think I should do?!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I think you should fuck her, that's
dialog: what I think you should do.
text: Jamie looks over at Mitch, weirded out; he gets up and
text: crosses into the hallway for some privacy.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't blow this for me, dude, she's
dialog: my Tuesday night regular.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But wouldn't I be...sort of...
dialog: cheating on Jamie? Maybe?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No! Cheating is when any part of
dialog: your penis touches any part of
dialog: another woman who is not your wife,
dialog: and last I checked, your wang is
text: safely tucked away in my incredibly
text: lame triple-pleated sport slacks.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But my mind is over here, doesn't
dialog: that count... somehow?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, how many women have you
dialog: fucked in your mind? Thousands?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Millions.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Right, and that's not cheating,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Your reasoning is oddly impeccable.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I think you're on firm legal ground
dialog: here, amigo. I say jump that ass.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Jesus ...I haven't had sex with
dialog: another woman since college...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Well, it still works the same, but
dialog: this chick is a lot to handle so
dialog: pace yourself, okay? She's hornier
text: than a priest at summer camp.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh my God so am I--.
text: There's a KNOCK at the apartment door. Dave jumps, freaked:

dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy shit she's already here! What
dialog: do I do?!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You'll do fine. Just wear a condom,
dialog: okay? Don't give me AIDS--
text: Just then WHAM -- the door flies open and a very sexy blonde
text: enters the apartment wearing a long trenchcoat and five inch
text: stiletto heels. She moves towards Dave like a panther.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (freezing, breathless)
dialog: Tatiana...
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: Are you ready to ride?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I-I honestly don't know...
text: She throws off her trenchcoat to reveal she's not wearing
dialog: anything underneath. Awesome.
text: Less awesome is the fact that she's NINE MONTHS PREGNANT.
text: Massive breasts sit atop a huge, distended, veiny, protruding
text: stomach. Dave recoils.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: DAAAH!
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: Why the fuck are you still wearing
dialog: clothes?
text: As she advances towards him, Dave climbs up the futon.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But you're--?! When are you due?!
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: Any minute now, so let's get our
dialog: fuck on before this becomes a
text: threesome.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh god gross! Wait, who's the
dialog: father? Am I the father?!
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: No...but you are my daddy...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
text: She smiles coyly and slides on top of him.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Holy shit you're so heavy--
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: My tits are aching for you.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Actually that's probably just the
dialog: colostrum coming in, it can be very
speaker_heading: PAINFUL--
text: Tatiana finally stops with the femme fatale routine.
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: Okay: what's your deal tonight?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Nothing! Nothing. I just--
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: Is it my new haircut?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No...?
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: The trenchcoat? Too cliche?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No! I love the coat.
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: Is it, I don't know, the pregnancy?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well...now that you mention it?
dialog: Maybe, like, a little?
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: What the hell?! You picked me up at
dialog: a Single Mothers Lamaze class! What
dialog: did you expect?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: (HORRIFIED)
dialog: I did?! That's terrible! Who would
dialog: do something like that?!
text: Tatiana angrily crosses the room and -- with considerable
text: effort -- bends over and picks up her trenchcoat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, Tatiana, I'm sorry. You're
dialog: incredibly beautiful, it's just--
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: (turning, fully naked)
dialog: What?! I'm not sexy?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh my god I can see it kicking.
text: You can, in fact, see the fetus moving around in her belly.
speaker_heading: TATIANA
dialog: You know what? Fuck you, Mitch.
dialog: Don't ever call me again.
text: She yanks on her coat and storms out. Dave stammers.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM -- NIGHT
text: It's bedtime. Wearing pajama pants and no shirt, Mitch
text: brushes his teeth and fixes his hair, trying to look sexy. He
text: sucks in his dad-gut in the mirror.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Jesus, Dave, it's called a sit-up.
text: Then he sees Jamie's dress land on the bedroom floor,
text: followed by her bra... Mitch exhales:
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy shit, I'm finally going to
dialog: fuck Jamie. This is my greatest
dialog: hour! I hope she likes it weird!
text: Then, IN SLOW MOTION, Jamie enters the bathroom, nude, her
text: hair gently blowing in the wind from an open window. She
text: looks insanely hot. Mitch takes her all in, ravenous...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God I am going to ruin her--
text: And then she sits on the can. And starts taking a dump.
text: Mitch's face drops, horrified.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I have to cool it on the Thai food.
dialog: I've had the shits all day.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
text: Mitch just stares at her, dumbstruck, as we hear the LOOSE
text: CONTENTS OF HER BOWELS empty into the toilet bowl.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh my GOD.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Seriously -- light a candle.
text: She keeps shitting. It sounds like Niagara Falls. Thunderous.
text: Foregoing the candle, Mitch covers his nose with his forearm
text: and stumbles out of the bathroom, nauseous...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER
text: Mitch lies in bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling,
text: horrified. Jamie slides in bed with him, touches his arm--
speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: (RECOILING)
dialog: DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What is your problem?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Look, I am not attracted to you
dialog: right now, okay?! So just... No
dialog: means no, all right? No means no...
text: TIGHT ON Jamie rolling over, confused and genuinely hurt...
scene_heading: TIME DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS
text: Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then a second baby
text: joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear
dialog: the worst two words a parent can ever hear:
speaker_heading: JAMIE (O.S.)
dialog: Your turn.
speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.)
dialog: Mmm?
speaker_heading: JAMIE (O.S.)
dialog: It's your turn to feed the twins.
speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah...I really don't feel like it.
text: Jamie turns on the light, pissed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No, it's 3 in the morning, you go
dialog: do it. You're the mother.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Get the fuck out bed right now and
dialog: go feed your fucking children or I
dialog: will fucking cut you!
text: Mitch is already scrambling out of the room, terrified.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes Jamie I'm sorry Jamie!
scene_heading: INT. TWIN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Mitch just looks at the twins, SCREAMING in their respective
text: cribs, no idea what to do. He reaches for the phone. Dials.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH DAVE
text: in Mitch's apartment, jacking off to some (very small)
text: internet porn on Mitch's iPhone. Then the porn disappears,
text: and "DAVE LOCKWOOD CALLING" appears on screen.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh come on...
dialog: (answering, panting)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I always thought your wife was a
dialog: nice lady but she is neither nice
dialog: nor a lady! She talks like a dock-
dialog: worker and she shits like one too!
dialog: Plus I used to think your kids were
dialog: adorable but actually they're just
dialog: really fucking annoying and crazy
dialog: needy-- Wait, are you jacking off?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What? No!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So why are you panting?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Look, I had to, I never get this
dialog: kind of privacy anymore.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: But isn't that sort of...my penis?
text: Dave looks down.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah. I guess. Is that weird?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I. .don't know?
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: It sort of hooks to the side a bit.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah. Go lefty, you'll get better
dialog: torque.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Cool, thanks. Hey, how long have
dialog: you been shaved down there?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It's kind of pro forma now, dude.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, only married dudes still rock
dialog: dick-fros anymore-- wait: if
dialog: Tatiana was over earlier, why do
dialog: you still need to jack off?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeeeah, Tatiana might not be coming
dialog: back. Like, ever.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What did you do?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Me?! She's nine months pregnant!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh my God you're so picky!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I could see the baby kicking, dude!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So what, she's having a girl! It
dialog: wouldn't have been a little boy
dialog: tickling your tip! Jesus, I can't
dialog: believe you fucked up my Tuesday
dialog: night regular!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Relax, Mitch--
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No! You married guys have no idea
dialog: how hard it is to build a reliable
dialog: stable! You don't! It's a full time
dialog: job! Getting girls' phone numbers,
dialog: calling them, emailing them,
text: Facebooking them, Twittering them,
dialog: buying them drinks and dinners and
dialog: coffees and listening to endless
dialog: stories about their stupid fucking
text: friends and begging them to touch
dialog: your wiener on the second date and
text: building an elaborate web of lies
dialog: so they don't all find out about
dialog: each other -- it's exhausting! And
dialog: then poof! In one night, you just
dialog: casually discard my life's work!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Jesus, okay, I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Sorry doesn't lick my ballbag every
dialog: Tuesday night...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Look, is there a reason you're
dialog: calling me at 3 in the morning?
text: Mitch glares back to the twins, who are still WAILING.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, your mean wife is making me
dialog: feed the kids. What do I do?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Have you changed their diapers
dialog: already?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (beat, lying)
dialog: Yes. Obviously.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Okay, take them to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hold on.
text: Mitch puts the phone in his mouth and picks up the SCREAMING
text: TWINS. Carrying them like bags of wheat, he jogs down
speaker_heading: THE HALLWAY
text: as they scream their heads off. He's totally rattled:
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: SHUT UP! STOP CRYING! JESUS CHRIST,
dialog: WE FUCKING HEAR YOU!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Mitch jogs into the kitchen and, plop, sets the twins on the
text: COUNTER, then speaks into the phone again:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: All right. In the kitchen.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Go to the fridge...
text: Mitch turns away from the twins and opens the fridge. He sees
text: a bottle of wine and immediately drinks from the bottle.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: Defrost two bags of breastmilk in
dialog: the microwave for 3 minutes, then
dialog: prepare two separate bottles...
text: Mitch grabs a container of cow's milk, sniffs it, turns to
text: give it to the babies -- to discover that Sarah is gone, and
text: Peter is licking an ELECTRICAL SOCKET!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Holy fuck!
text: Mitch yanks Peter away just as SPARKS shoot from the socket!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Nothing! Go on! Two bottles...?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: First: attach the filter to the
dialog: seal to the nipple...
text: Mitch hears CLINK CLINK and spins to see that Sarah has
text: crawled over to the KNIFE BLOCK and removed a BUTCHER KNIFE
text: and a MEAT CLEAVER and is waving them about like rattles!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh jesus oh jesus...
text: Mitch approaches her, wide-eyed, tentative -- when Sarah
text: giggles and spastically whips the cleaver at him! He barely
text: sidesteps it, and it impacts into a cupboard door -- F-TWANG!
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: This is so fucked up!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I know, right? And make sure you
dialog: don't allow any air bubbles in.
text: Mitch grabs a pair of tongs and, after a few attempts,
text: snatches the butcher knife from Sarah's hands. Then he scoops
text: her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother.
text: Finally, he slumps over, trying to catch his breath.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude. Listen to me: you need to go
dialog: downtown first thing tomorrow
dialog: morning and you need to find that
dialog: fucking fountain...
text: He starts pouring cow's milk into the babies' mouths. It
text: splashes all over them, but they manage to lap up some of it.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Honestly, I'm really not sure how
dialog: much more of this shit I can take.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A DESK PLACARD READING "DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON"
text: District Manager Carla Nelson sits behind her desk in her
text: bland, putty office, the next morning. She is still bored.
scene_heading: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
dialog: Good news. Your formal information
dialog: request was approved.
text: Dave stops pacing, deeply relieved.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Great. So where's the fountain?
scene_heading: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
dialog: Oh. We won't hear back for one to
dialog: three weeks, maybe more.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: WHAT? How long can it possibly take
dialog: you to find your own fountain?!
scene_heading: CARLA MELSON DAVE
dialog: One to three weeks, maybe One to three weeks, maybe
dialog: more. more.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks, Carla, you just ruined my
dialog: life. Have an awesome day.
text: Dave blows out of there, choking on his fury...
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
text: DAVE RACING INTO HIS OWN HOUSE
text: still furious. He looks around for Mitch.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mitch?! Mitch?! Bad news, buddy!
text: Dave bounds up the stairs...
scene_heading: INT. NURSERY -- MORNING
text: Jamie quietly CRIES as she gets the twins dressed for the
dialog: day. Dave charges in--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Real bad news--!
text: Jamie startles and quickly dries her eyes.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
text: Dave's in the shower.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Are you okay...?
text: Dave enters, concerned, and instinctively starts helping her
text: dress the babies. She watches him, a bit confused.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, you can tell me. We've
dialog: been friends forever...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
speaker_heading: (EXHALES)
dialog: It's Dave ...he's been acting so
dialog: strange lately. Last night... Last
dialog: night he even told me he wasn't
dialog: attracted to me...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh my god I'm going to fucking kill
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Just tell me honestly...is Dave
dialog: having an affair?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No. Jamie. I swear he's not. You're
dialog: just going through a very temporary
dialog: rough patch, okay?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Temporary? We've been in this rough
dialog: patch for years
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (this is news to him)
dialog: Y-You have?!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: You don't want to hear about this.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No I really do. Tell me everything.
text: Jamie looks at him, sees the urgency in his eyes. Frowns.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: It's not his fault, really...I love
dialog: him with all my heart, you know I
dialog: do, but-you remember Dave's
dialog: family growing up. They were a
dialog: mess. They had nothing. Dave's
dialog: entire childhood was spent looking
text: over the fence, wanting a better
dialog: life. So he scrimped and saved and
dialog: worked four jobs at once and put
dialog: himself through school and built a
dialog: better life for himself. I've
dialog: always loved that about him.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: No one ever gave him anything. The
dialog: problem is, now that he's got a
dialog: good life, he can't turn it off --
text: he's still looking over the fence,
dialog: wanting something even better, a
dialog: second house, more kids, a faster
dialog: car, a bigger promotion, whatever
dialog: it is that he thinks will finally
dialog: make him happy.
text: Dave reddens, defensive; this is hitting very close to home.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: well poor Jamie! You have an
text: ambitious, hard-working husband who
dialog: provides for you and your family --
dialog: how can you even stand it?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
speaker_heading: (TAKEN ABACK)
dialog: No, I know, I should be grateful...
dialog: and I am...I guess all I'm saying
dialog: is that Dave is so focussed on what
dialog: he doesn't have that he can't see
dialog: what he does. And how long can you
dialog: stay married to someone who is
dialog: incapable of ever being happy...?
text: She looks at him, searching. Dave stammers, realizing for the
dialog: first time just how much trouble his marriage is in... Then:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Check it out: I have freckles on my
dialog: taint! How awesome is that?!
text: They turn to see Mitch in the doorway, buck naked and wet,
text: holding a hand-mirror under his balls. Then he sees Dave.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, hey, fag. Why're you here?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MITCH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: One to three weeks, maybe more?!
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM -- DAY
text: Mitch shaves in the bathroom as Dave paces, anxious.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What the fuck does that even mean?!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It means we might be in each
dialog: other's bodies for a while...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What?! No! I can't do this anymore!
dialog: Your life sucks!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: My life sucks?! You drive a Fiero--
text: Jamie calls through the door:
speaker_heading: JAMIE (O.S.)
dialog: Um, I'm going to work?
speaker_heading: DAVE MITCH
dialog: All right, angel! Have a nice day!
speaker_heading: JAMIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You guys okay in there?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yup! Just two dudes chilling in the
dialog: bathroom, nothing weird about that!
speaker_heading: JAMIE (O.S.)
dialog: Okay...? See you later...
text: We hear Jamie's FOOTSTEPS retreat. Dave grows emotional:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Listen to me: I know I complain
dialog: about my family sometimes, but
dialog: Jamie and the kids are everything
dialog: to me... My marriage is falling
dialog: apart, my job is on the line, and I
dialog: need you to step up and be the best
dialog: possible version of me, okay?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, honestly, I'm working my nuts
dialog: off over here. I don't know how to
dialog: play you any better.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well. Then I'm just gonna have to
dialog: teach you. Let's start at the
speaker_heading: BEGINNING:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S BEDROOM -- CLOSET -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Dave holds up a suit from his closet. Mitch watches.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This is called a suit. You have to
dialog: wear one every day, along with--
dialog: (holding up tie)
speaker_heading: A NECKTIE--
dialog: (holding up socks)
dialog: Black -- not white -- socks--
dialog: (holding up dress shoes)
dialog: Dress shoes, not shower sandals--
dialog: (holding up boxers)
dialog: And underwear.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh come on!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No! No more commando! You are a
dialog: grown-ass man!
text: Mitch mimics heiling Hitler and starts getting dressed...
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S KITCHEN -- DAY
text: Mitch, highly uncomfortable in his business suit, scowls as
text: Dave shows him the kids' schedules on the fridge.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This is called a schedule. It tells
dialog: you everything you need to do in a
dialog: given day. Drop offs. Pick ups.
dialog: Activities. Playdates. Doctors
dialog: appointments. You'll notice that
dialog: there are approximately 50 hours
dialog: worth of obligations on any given
dialog: day. Find a way.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S AUDI STATION WAGON -- DAY
text: Dave drives. Mitch slumps in the passenger seat, grumpy.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Always be thinking of your next
dialog: responsibility. It helps to break
dialog: your day into four minute
dialog: increments. And remember: there is
dialog: no margin for error.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you pick up the twins, the
text: drycleaning and the diaper cream
dialog: but forget the organic quince paste
dialog: from that little place on Abbot
dialog: Kinney, everyone still hates you.
dialog: You have to be perfect.
scene_heading: INT. WHOLE FOODS SUPERMARKET -- DAY
text: Dave walks Mitch through Whole Foods with a cart, selecting
text: various items from the list.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This is called a grocery store. You
dialog: buy food here. Before heading to
dialog: the market, always call Jamie first
dialog: and ask her if she needs anything.
dialog: In fact, before you make anV
dialog: decisions in your life, no matter
dialog: how small, call your wife first.
dialog: Think of yourself as a retarded
text: mule lost in the desert: helpless,
dialog: dumb, and in constant need of
dialog: direction. Never take initiative,
dialog: never strike out on your own, never
dialog: deviate from the plan: you are
dialog: always wrong. You are a retarded
text: mule lost in the desert.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S AUDI STATION WAGON -- DAY
text: They drive down the street, the car packed with groceries.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: When you're with Jamie, you should
dialog: always be doing one of three
dialog: things: asking her permission,
dialog: complimenting her, or begging her
dialog: forgiveness. It doesn't matter if
dialog: she already said you could go to
dialog: poker night, or if she looks like
dialog: fucking Mothra in that dress, or if
dialog: you didn't do anything wrong.
dialog: Permission, compliments, apologies.
dialog: That's all anyone wants to hear out
dialog: of a husband's mouth. Here, let's
dialog: practice: what's your favorite
dialog: joke?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Umm...? A rabbi, a priest--?
text: BAM! Dave punches Mitch in the nuts.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Trick question! No one fucking
dialog: cares! You're Dave Lockwood, boring
dialog: dad, you're not Jerry Fucking
dialog: Seinfeld! Shut the fuck up!
text: Mitch clutches his balls, hurt and scared...
scene_heading: INT. PRE-SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY
text: Dave and Mitch, wearing sombreros, sit behind a tiny desk in
text: this colorful pre-school classroom, preparing the healthy
text: snacks they just purchased for Cara and her rowdy CLASSMATES.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: These are called children, or
dialog: dependents. Never disparage your
dialog: own children -- everything they do
dialog: is a miracle from God. When they're
dialog: bad, it's only because they're
text: tired or going through a phase.
dialog: When other people's kids are bad,
dialog: however, it's because of indulgent
dialog: parenting or innate defects in the
scene_heading: CHILD'S CHARACTER--
text: A cute little BOY snatches three apple slices.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: One a piece, please, Dylan.
speaker_heading: (TO MITCH)
dialog: Kid's a natural born criminal. If
dialog: he sees 18, it'll be from the
text: inside a jail cell.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Dave walks Mitch through the office.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: This is called an office, or work.
dialog: Think about whatever you most want
dialog: to do here, and then do the exact
dialog: opposite. You want to go home
dialog: early? Great: stay all night.
dialog: Hungry? Cool: don't eat. Think your
dialog: boss is a total douche? Terrific:
dialog: invite him to join your fantasy
dialog: baseball league.
text: A cute ASSOCIATE walks by and Mitch overtly eye-fucks her all
text: the way past. Dave nut-punches him again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're married now, jackass! You
dialog: can't look at other women, you
dialog: can't talk to other women, you
dialog: can't even be interesting around
dialog: other women! Do everything in your
dialog: power to de-sexualize yourself --
dialog: wear a fannypack, drive a Passat,
dialog: affix electronic devices to your
dialog: belt -- whatever it takes. If
dialog: you're forced to interact with a
dialog: woman, quickly find a way to
dialog: mention that you're married. It
text: doesn't even have to make sense.
dialog: Just be like "Nice weather today,
dialog: I'm totally fucking married."
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Wait, so I can't sleep with my wife
dialog: and I can't sleep with other women?
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's called marriage.
text: Dave turns into his office, nodding at his mean secretary.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good morning, Gladys.
text: She scowls at him, confused, who's this guy? Then Mitch
text: passes and wiggles his tongue at her, simulating cunnilingus.
text: The old lady GASPS, appalled...
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
text: They enter Dave's office.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Do you have any other questions?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah -- when's your free time?
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: (COCK-PUNCHING him again)
dialog: Have you been listening to one word

dialog: free time! You don't have a life

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dry handjob?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Nothing! You're not single anymore!
dialog: No one gives you a cupcake every

dialog: complete sentences, it's expected
dialog: of you now, so grow up!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Okay, can I just say something
dialog: without you punching my cock?
dialog: (Dave inhales, go)

scene_heading: VOICE AT THE DOOR
dialog: Knock knock?
text: Both men turn to see Sabrina in the doorway, looking lovely
text: in a short skirt suit, holding documents. Mitch straightens.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: HELL-lo legs.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Yes...um...sort of big news.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (solicitous, creepy)
dialog: Please, come in! Coffee? Scotch?
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: (entering, tentative)
dialog: No... thanks? Anyway, Kinkabe and

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Two days? Are you kidding me?!
text: Sabrina glances at Dave, confused, no idea who he is.

speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: N-No? Anyway, I'll have my briefs

speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: And that is Level 4 Sexual

speaker_heading: MITCH

speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Have. . .Have we met?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (shaking Sabrina's hand)
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry, no. I'm Mitch,
dialog: Dave's completely idiotic friend.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
scene_heading: (SMILING SLIGHTLY)
dialog: Sabrina McArdle. Nice to meet you.
text: Mitch notices their chemistry and immediately blurts out:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You guys should go out!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah! You're single now, Mitch,
dialog: remember? And Sabrina is stone
dialog: fucking hot! Look at that body!
dialog: Sabrina: swimmer in college?
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Dave--?
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You two should go out, have a nice

dialog: fuck on the roof, you know what I
dialog: mean? How's 8pm tomorrow night,
dialog: Richter's Steakhouse?

speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Um, good, I guess...?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Great! I know for a fact that Mitch
dialog: is free, so he'll see you there!
dialog: And honey: wear something tight,
dialog: you know what I mean? Make it fun.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Yeah...I'm gonna go now...?
text: Sabrina hurries out, appalled. Dave clutches his forehead:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh my god I'm so fucking fired.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No dude: you're so fucking laid!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You can't talk to women like that
dialog: at work! Or anywhere, really!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm sorry, I just got you a date
dialog: with the number one girl on your
dialog: Cancer List and this is the thanks
dialog: I get?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm not going on the date, Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes you are.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No. I'm not.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes you are, because if you don't,
dialog: I will feed'your children non-
dialog: organic snacks and then introduce
dialog: them to my extensive girl-on-horse
dialog: pornography collection. How do you
dialog: think Jamie will react to that?
text: Dave just looks at Mitch, horrified.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Why...Why are you doing this to me?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Because I've seen your life and if
dialog: you don't loosen up soon you are
dialog: literally going to die. So go out
dialog: with this chick. Have fun. Bust a
dialog: nut. Remember why life is beautiful
dialog: again, okay? Please?
text: This actually gets to Dave a bit. He frowns, fine...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Also, see if she likes to fuck on

scene_heading: INT. PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
text: His work day over, Mitch strides through the parking lot,
text: heading for his car, cheerfully waving to various COMMUTERS:
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: GOOD EVENING! / HAVE A PLEASANT
text: COMMUTE! / WHAT A WONDERFUL BROOCH!
text: Mitch reaches his Audi station wagon when--
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Dave?
text: Mitch turns to see his father, MITCH, SR. passing, smiling.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh! Hey... Mister ...Planko? What are
dialog: you doing here?
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: My attorney's in this building...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
text: He notices the HUMAN STICK FIGURES on Dave's rear windshield,
text: labelled for each member of his family. He smiles at them:
speaker_heading: MITCH, SR. (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, what a neat idea!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, maybe if you're from Kansas.
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Your parents are very lucky to have
dialog: so many grandchildren.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (quick, sharp)
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Nothing! Nothing. How are y--?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I mean, you still have a really
dialog: fucking cool son, right?!
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Yes, Mitch is definitely cool...
dialog: How are the twins?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: They're fucking fine-- what the
dialog: fuck does that mean, "Mitch is
dialog: definitely cool?!"
dialog: MITCH, SR.
speaker_heading: (TAKEN ABACK)
dialog: Nothing. No, it's my fault... I
dialog: spoiled him rotten after his mother
dialog: passed away, but...
text: He trails off, clearly not wanting to talk about this.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: But what, dude?! Spit it out!
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: But now he's a total fuck up.
text: Mitch actually GASPS. His dad smiles sadly:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: MITCH, SR. (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, he's a great guy, he's the
dialog: life of the party, but he has no
dialog: work ethic, he has no backbone,
dialog: he'll never build a family or a
dialog: career or anything of substance
dialog: like you have. He's... embarrassing.
text: Mitch stands there, mouth agape, just decimated.
speaker_heading: MITCH, SR. (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, I'm sorry to go on and on.
dialog: How's your lovely wife--?
text: Mitch starts TEARING UP and fumbling with the car door.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Your son is not a fuck up, M-Mr.
dialog: Planko! He's just a late bloomer!
text: His dad looks utterly confused as Mitch gets into the car.
dialog: MITCH, SR.
dialog: Dave? Are you crying...?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm just very close to
dialog: Mitch and when people say mean
dialog: things about him I hurt too--
text: He SLAMS the door shut and jerks out of the parking spot,
text: tears pouring down his face. His dad watches on, bewildered.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S CAR -- NIGHT
text: Mitch angrily drives home, trying to stop crying.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Fuck! Fuck...
text: And then Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" comes on the radio.
text: Mitch's expression slowly turns to steely determination...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: BLACK STILLNESS
text: As "Eye of the Tiger" continues playing, we hear a baby
text: SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then we hear a second baby join in.
text: Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear:
speaker_heading: JAMIE
scene_heading: YOUR TURN--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
text: Mitch sits bolt upright in bed like Rambo, totally awake, his
text: jaw set, and bounds out of bed...
scene_heading: INT. NURSERY -- NIGHT
text: Mitch aggressively changes the twins' diapers. He's doing a
dialog: terrible job, but he's focussed, working hard...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Mitch assembles two baby bottles as the twins sit in the sink
text: SCREAMING. He SCREAMS back at them...
scene_heading: INT. DEN -- NIGHT
text: Mitch sits erect on the couch like a Navajo warrior, feeding
text: the twins, his eyes afire...
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S CAR -- THE NEXT MORNING
text: Wearing fingerless driving gloves, Mitch races the twins to

scene_heading: INT. STEEL, KUHBACH, MCCLOUD -- LAW FIRM -- MORNING
text: Mitch blows into the office, looking sharp in a business
text: suit. He points at other lawyers, amped up, not smiling.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: LET'S DO SOME LAW, GUYS! GET SOME!
text: His old secretary Gladys falls in step with him.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
scene_heading: GOOD MORN--
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I need the book CORPORATE LAW FOR
dialog: DUMMIES, every season of Law &amp;
dialog: Order on DVD and Blu-Ray, and the
dialog: biggest fucking coffee you can
dialog: carry on my desk in 15 minutes or
dialog: else you're fired.
text: Gladys writes this down on a pad of paper, a bit turned on...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Also get yourself a new haircut and
text: a pair of six inch stripper shoes.
dialog: It's time to take this shit to the
dialog: next level.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- LATER
text: Mitch studies a legal casebook while chugging coffee. Law &amp;
text: Order plays on the TV in the background. Then an ALARM sounds
text: on his desk and he races out of his office, all business...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Mitch hurries into the pediatrician's office, talking on his
text: BlackBerry phone, a twin in each arm, a cigarette dangling
text: from his mouth. The RECEPTIONIST frowns. Mitch makes the
text: universal "jerking off" motion with his hand...
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET -- DAY
text: Mitch races through the supermarket with a cart, grabbing
text: items off the shelves like Supermarket Sweeps...
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY
text: Mitch jogs into the crowded auditorium and sits next to
text: Jamie. The ballet recital is already in progress...
text: ONSTAGE, two dozen adorable little BALLERINAS in pink tutu's
dialog: pile and jete about...
text: Jamie points out little Cara in pigtails. Mitch smiles.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Fuck me she's cute...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Uh oh, here comes the second
dialog: battement glisse...
text: Jamie tenses up. Mitch does too...
text: As Cara starts her spin, Nicolette Peters goes to push her
text: over -- and Cara calmly grabs her arm, FLIPS her over her
text: shoulder, and drops her flat on her back with a loud WHAM!
text: As Nicolette starts CRYING, Cara calmly continues dancing
text: like nothing happened. The other girls on stage look pleased.
speaker_heading: Mitch CLAPS and WHISTLES:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: FUCK YEAH! NICE ONE, CARA!
text: Jamie hits him, SHE, but is clearly proud of her little girl.
text: A dozen rows ahead of them, NICOLETTE'S FATHER -- a huge
text: former linebacker -- leaps up, outraged:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE'S FATHER
text: HEY! THAT GIRL JUST FLIPPED MY
speaker_heading: DAUGHTER!
text: Mitch hops up, equally fired up.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR DAUGHTER IS A
dialog: FUCKING CUNT!
text: The entire auditorium SILENCES. Nicolette's father turns.
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE'S FATHER
dialog: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?!
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: YOU HEARD ME, PAL! YOUR DAUGHTER
dialog: HAD IT COMING!
text: Nicolette's father, his face beet red, starts climbing over
text: people and seats, insanely gunning for Mitch!
speaker_heading: NICOLETTE'S FATHER
dialog: YOU'RE A DEAD MAN!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Honey--?.
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: BRING IT, FUCK-NUTS!
text: Mitch bounds over the seats, charging right back at him!
text: ON STAGE Mrs. Kleinmen and all the little ballerinas stand
text: frozen, mouths agape, watching Mitch and Nicolette's father
text: claw their way over seats, trying to get to each other!
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I'M GONNA RIP YOUR FUCKING FACE OFF-
text: WHAM! Nicolette's dad levels him OUT OF FRAME as we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JAMIE'S BMW STATION WAGON -- EVENING
text: Jamie drives along, a slight smile on her face. Mitch sits
text: shotgun, battered and beaten, holding an ice pack to his
text: cheek. Cara sits in her carseat in the back, a bit stunned.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Well, looks like you won't be doing
text: ballet at the rec center anymore.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: That's okay. I didn't really like
dialog: it anyway.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Where'd you learn to ninja-flip a
dialog: girl like that?
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: The internet.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Good girl. So what'd we learn from
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Always solve my problems with
dialog: violence.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: That's right, baby. Bones.
text: They bump fists. Jamie is stunned.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What?! No, angel, that's exactly
dialog: the wrong lesson. You should never
dialog: use violence, except to defend
dialog: yourself, okay?
text: Mitch subtly shakes his head at Cara, don't listen to her.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Violence is cool.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Dave!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm kidding!
speaker_heading: (TO CARA)
dialog: I'm not kidding.
text: Cara GIGGLES in the backseat. Jamie can't help but laugh too.
text: Soon they're all LAUGHING. It's a nice moment.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I love you, Daddy...
speaker_heading: MITCH
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: Oh. I-I love you too, angel.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
text: Jamie smiles over at Mitch...
text: TIGHT ON MITCH as he feels the family love for the first
text: time. He looks touched... even a little proud...
text: Then his cell phone rings. He answers it:
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Lockwood.
speaker_heading: DAVE (ON PHONE)
dialog: I haven't been on a first date in
dialog: over a decade and I'm drowning in
dialog: my own fear--!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Don't move. I'll be right over.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: MITCH KICKING OPEN THE DOOR
text: of his old apartment to find Dave, in khaki's and a pressed
text: buttondown, freaking out in the mirror--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: How do I look?!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Like a fucking tool. Step aside--
text: Mitch throws open the closet and yanks out a pair of jeans.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: These are called jeans. They've
dialog: been very popular with our nation's
dialog: young people for over 60 years. Put
text: them on immediately.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Jeans? To a restaurant?
text: Mitch punches Dave in the nuts; he doubles over.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Shut up and do what I say. We only
dialog: have 3 hours to make you cool...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S BATHROOM
text: Mitch shows Dave how to put gel into his hair.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: This is called gel, or product. Use
dialog: too little and you look like a
dialog: pedophile Cub Scout leader, use too
dialog: much and you look Persian. Neither
dialog: is a winning hand.
text: Dave very nervously applies gel to his hair...
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S SHOWER STALL
text: Dave stands with his pants around his ankles as Mitch very
text: delicately shaves his balls with a Bic razor.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Okay, normally I would never do
dialog: this for another man, but since
dialog: we're in a rush, and technically
dialog: this is my testicle bag, I'm making
dialog: a rare exception. Always man-scape
text: before a first date. It shows a
dialog: lady that you're clean,
dialog: considerate, and American.
speaker_heading: DAVE
scene_heading: IT TICKLES--
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Don't speak, it jiggles your sack.
scene_heading: EXT. EXOTIC MOTORCARS -- EVENING
text: Exotic sells the most pimped-out used cars in LA. Mitch
text: SQUEALS off the lot in a RED FERRARI and cruises down the
text: Sunset Strip, music BLASTING. Dave sits shotgun, stunned.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I can't believe you just charged a
dialog: Ferrari to my Discover Card.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You need to learn to be
dialog: spontaneous, Dave. Chicks like
dialog: spontaneous.
dialog: (to WOMEN walking by)
dialog: Hey ladies! Show us your tits!
text: They flip him off. Mitch laughs. Dave is still floored:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What are we gonna tell Jamie...?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Do me a favor, Dave. Relax your
text: butt hole.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Your sphincter. Just... release it.
text: Dave's entire body visibly relaxes a bit.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't even know it was
dialog: puckered, right? Now recline your
dialog: seat a bit...
speaker_heading: (DAVE RECLINES)
dialog: Good. Now take some deep breaths.
dialog: (Dave does, calming)
dialog: Now give me your sunglasses.
text: Dave gives him his sunglasses; Mitch chucks them out the
text: window and hands him his cool Ray Ban's.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, just for like three minutes,
dialog: don't be a dad, don't be a husband,
dialog: don't be a lawyer, just be a dude
text: rolling down Sunset strip in a
dialog: fucking Ferrari with his best
dialog: friend listening to Seal, okay?
text: Dave looks out the window, getting into it...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Feels good, right?
text: After a moment, a TEAR escapes from under Dave's shades.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay, just let it out.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's been so long since I felt
dialog: cool...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I know, baby. I know.
text: They cruise for a bit longer, then Mitch pulls into a CAR
text: WASH. Dave looks confused.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Why are we washing the car? It's
dialog: brand new.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: We're not washing the car, David.
dialog: We're getting you mentally,
dialog: physically, and spiritually ready
dialog: for your date. Come on.
scene_heading: INT. CAR WASH -- LOBBY -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Mitch and a very confused Dave enter the car wash lobby.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Now. I don't have time to cover all
dialog: the ways in which women have
dialog: changed since you last dated...
text: Mitch stops at the register to pay. Various CAR WASH
text: EMPLOYEES keep saying hi to Dave, weirding him out.
scene_heading: CAR WASH EMPLOYEES
dialog: Hola, Mitch! / Como esta, Mitch?!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: The bottom line is: the internet
dialog: has revolutionized everything.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You mean like J-date?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Fuck J-date. No. The internet has
dialog: changed chicks in three major ways:
dialog: first, access and acceptance of
dialog: pornography has commoditized women
dialog: and pressured them into becoming
text: sluttier at far younger ages, which
dialog: is awesome.
text: Mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Second: text messaging has de-
dialog: stigmatized the booty call. Call a
dialog: girl at 3 in the morning for sex
dialog: and it's creepy. Text her "SUCK
dialog: WANG MIDNIGHT??" and it's classy. I
dialog: have no idea why, but again, an
dialog: awesome development.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Third: Facebook and other social
dialog: networking sites have falsely
dialog: convinced people -- women included
dialog: -- that they are funny,
dialog: interesting, and unique. Get used
dialog: to listening waaay more than you
dialog: used to. Chicks are the new dudes,
dialog: they talk about themselves all the
dialog: fucking time now. Practice saying
dialog: things like "you are so different"
dialog: and "no, really, what Golden Girl
dialog: would you be?" and "I love Lady
dialog: Gaga too."
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What's a Lady Gaga?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I don't know, it's either a pop
text: singer or an energy drink.
text: They arrive at the CAR WASH WAITING AREA. People sit around,
text: waiting for their cars, many of them young, female, and cute.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, let's talk to some honeys,
dialog: get your flow going again.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So wait, why are we at a car wash?
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: The girls are alone, bored, and old
dialog: enough to drive -- it's a goldmine.
dialog: I run game here four to seven times
dialog: a week. Now go on, bust a move.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come on, I talk to women all the
dialog: time, I don't need to practice.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yes. And no offense, as a married
dialog: man, I probably know how to talk to
dialog: women better than you do.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Reall v!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yes! It's not that hard. They just
dialog: want to be respected and listened
dialog: to like everybody else.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Okay Daddy Day Care show me how
dialog: it's done then! Shit!
text: Dave sighs and crosses to a CUTE BLONDE texting nearby. As he
text: draws closer, however, he starts to tense up...soon he's
text: sweating... it's been a long time ...by the time he finally
text: reaches the blonde, his voice is ridiculously shrill:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hello there what's your name?!
text: She doesn't even look up from her BlackBerry. Dave's
text: confidence instantly crumbles...
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I-I'm sorry, I'm not trying to hit
dialog: on you. I'm just...I mean, I'm
dialog: married, so that's not even a
dialog: thing. W-W-Where are you from--?
text: Mitch appears and yanks him away. Dave looks traumatized:
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Was she reaching for her rape
dialog: whistle?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Shake it off. Being single is like
dialog: the Tour De France: it's all about
dialog: quick recovery time. Now go on, get
dialog: your groove back, you're meeting
text: Sabrina in a half hour.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS:
text: Of Dave trying to chat up various YOUNG WOMEN at the carwash.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Your name is Dora? Like the
dialog: Explorah?! No...? You aren't
dialog: familiar with that show...?

scene_heading: ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (trying to be sexy)
dialog: So: what school district do you
dialog: live in?
scene_heading: ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yikes, what do your parents think
dialog: of all those piercings?!
scene_heading: ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: .and that's the difference
text: between a stroller and a pram.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: My car's ready.
text: The YOUNG WOMAN races off towards her newly cleaned car. Dave
text: slumps, shit. Mitch nods, looking at his watch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Forty seconds. Not bad. Your times
dialog: are improving.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I forgot how hard it is to be
dialog: single...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: As a general rule, when you're
dialog: talking to single women,
dialog: conversation topics to avoid
dialog: include: your wife, your children,
dialog: your favorite playgrounds, and The
dialog: Wiggles...
text: Dave nods, hating himself. Mitch heads for the Ferrari.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: But this was good. You worked out
dialog: all your bad game and now you're
dialog: ready to dominate. Come on.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FERRARI -- NIGHT
text: Mitch rockets down Sunset Boulevard. Dave looks nauseous.
dialog:

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I don't feel good about this.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Relax: you're dressed cool, your
dialog: hair is crushing it, your ballsack
dialog: is taut and smooth, and you're way
dialog: better looking than you've ever
dialog: been. Just remember Uncle Mitch's
dialog: Golden Rule of Dating.

dialog: I know, always use an alias.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What? No. No, my Golden Rule of
dialog: Dating is always find the fun.
dialog: Think of it like this: for the next
dialog: two hours, you're stuck with this
dialog: chick. Doesn't matter if she's cool
dialog: or crazy or if she was born with a
dialog: vagina on her forehead -- you're
dialog: stuck, so make the most of it. I
dialog: dated this chick named Topaz once
dialog: who may or may not have killed her
dialog: father. Long story short, she
dialog: looked like 50 miles of bad road
dialog: and I wasn't interested, but I used
dialog: our time together to learn about
dialog: incest and the failures of the
dialog: American Appellate Court system. I
dialog: found it hugely informative, and
dialog: Topaz got caught up in my
dialog: enthusiasm and gave me a crying
text: blowjob on the car-ride home, so
dialog: everybody won. The point is: find
dialog: the fun for yourself and great
dialog: things will follow.
text: Dave looks horrified as they roll up to RICHTER'S, a chic
dialog: steakhouse.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Power hug.
text: Mitch hugs a still-speechless Dave...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Now go on. Make daddy proud.

scene_heading: INT. RICHTER'S RESTAURANT -- A SHORT WHILE LATER
text: Richter's is dark, elegant, romantic. Dave sits at a candle-
text: lit table, anxiously folding and unfolding sugar packets.
text: Then Sabrina enters, looking stunning in a snug red dress,
text: and gazes around the restaurant. Dave's heart skips a beat,
text: and he waves her over. She approaches, smiling.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey. Hi. Hello.
text: He awkwardly goes to kiss her cheek while she goes for a
dialog: handshake. It's awkward/cute.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh -- whoop -- okay.
text: They sit. Dave stares at her, terrified. Then he blurts out:
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you like Googoo Lady?!
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: What. . .what is that?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I-I don't know! I really don't!
text: Sabrina smiles politely and looks around for a waiter. Dave
text: winces, hating himself to the very core of his being...
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: So. How long have you known Dave?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: M-My whole life, actually.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Annnd have you ever seen him act
dialog: like he did yesterday?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What, like a total douchebag?
text: She LAUGHS. Dave can't believe it. He loosens up a bit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's not fair. Dave...Dave isn't
dialog: himself right now. I hope he didn't
dialog: say anything to offend you...
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: No. I mean, he totally did, but
dialog: it's fine. I have brothers.
text: Dave pours both of them a glass of wine, finding his rhythm.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So. You like working with Dave?
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: I love it. He's the best.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Isn't he just?
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: I.. .eh, nevermind.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No, go on.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: I actually used to sort of have a
dialog: crush on him, if you must know...
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: You did? That's so... ironic!
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: I mean, he's married, so
dialog: obviously...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Right. Obviously. Well, I'm just
dialog: like Dave, only way more handsome.
text: She laughs. Dave smiles back, his confidence growing, as we
scene_heading: TIME DISSOLVE TO:
text: DAVE AND SABRINA TALKING AND LAUGHING
text: as they meander through the courses of their meal. We've
dialog: never seen Dave so animated and alive and happy...
scene_heading: TIME DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: EXT. RICHTER'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
text: Dave and Sabrina exit the restaurant. It's a warm night.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, I had a great time...
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Oh -- are we done? It's only 2.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Right! No! What are we, lame
dialog: married people? Let's go to a
dialog: rave...or something? Do people...
dialog: still do that? Raving?
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: My friend is spinning afterhours at
dialog: Foxtail, if you want...?
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: Spinning? Is that with the bikes?
text: Sabrina laughs and takes his arm.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: You're so funny! Come on!
scene_heading: EXT. FOXTAIL NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT
text: A line of HIPSTERS wait outside Foxtail. Holding Dave's hand,
text: Sabrina cuts the line, kisses the BOUNCER on the cheek, and
text: he lets them inside. Dave nods, awesome...
scene_heading: INT. FOXTAIL NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT
text: Dave and Sabrina get down on the sweaty, crowded dance floor.
text: The house music is deafening and the lights are hypnotizing
text: and everyone is having the time of their lives.
text: Dave, his shirt half-open, moves sensually in sync with
text: Sabrina, both of them possessed by the music. They're inches
text: apart and her dress and hair fly about in all the right ways.
scene_heading: INT. FOXTAIL NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT
text: Foxtail is closed, but Dave, with Sabrina on his lap, sits in
text: a booth drinking champagne with DJ BASSNECTAR and all of his
text: ridiculously cool friends. Dave tells a joke and everyone
text: laughs -- including KIEFER SUTHERLAND, who's sitting next to
text: him; Kiefer slaps Dave five. Nice!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN LOFT -- NIGHT
text: Dave, Sabrina, Bassnectar, Kiefer Sutherland, and a group of
text: hipsters play poker in Kiefer's unbelievable DOWNTOWN LOFT.
text: Music blasts, beer bottles litter the table, and everyone is
text: having fun. Sabrina wins a hand and does a victory dance...
scene_heading: EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD STREET -- NIGHT
text: Dave walks Sabrina home along her quaint, tree-lined street.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Now that was a first date...
speaker_heading: SABRINA
text: For a guy with a poker table in his
text: living room, Kiefer Sutherland is
text: surprisingly bad at poker.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I know. I'm not even sure he
dialog: understood the rules...
text: She laughs. Then they stop in front of her apartment. Beat.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: It's so weird, I feel like I've
dialog: known you for longer than just one
dialog: night...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah. Me too...
text: There's a lull for a kiss. Dave hesitates...so Sabrina moves
text: in and kisses him. It's sweet but passionate... When it's
text: over, Dave can barely speak:
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can...Can, um, can I call you
dialog: sometime? Do people still say that?
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Yes -- and you'd better.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Okay. Well. Good night, Sabrina.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Good night, Mitch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
text: She gives him a thoughtful smile then disappears inside. Dave
text: waits a second, then does a victorious karate chop, YES!
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY MORNING
text: Light floods into Mitch's apartment. Dave wakes up and looks
text: at the clock: 9:02.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Fuck that.
text: He rolls over and goes back to sleep, a smile on his face...
scene_heading: EXT. TOAST -- DAY
text: Dave sits at an outdoor table, reading a novel and taking his
text: time with brunch. He sees a BUSINESSMAN wolfing down his food
text: and running off to his car, yelling into his cell phone,
text: stressed out of his mind. Dave smiles and keeps reading...
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- DAY
text: Dave sits on the toilet, reading his novel and taking a
text: leisurely shit. We hear the clean KER-PLOP of a solid poo
text: hitting the toilet water, and Dave closes his eyes, nice...
scene_heading: EXT. BATTING CAGES -- DAY
text: Dave, in a Dodgers jersey, tees off on baseballs in a batting
text: cage. CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! It feels great...
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE -- MOVIE SET -- DAY
text: Dave, holding a cross-bow and wearing a loincloth, has fake
text: sex with his CO-STAR on a jungle set; their mid-sections are
text: conveniently obscured by a giant fern.
text: Dave is selling it, and when Valtan calls cut, the whole CREW
text: applauds, wildly impressed. Dave waves them off, bashful...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Looking hip in jeans, flip flops, and a mildly ironic tee
text: shirt, Dave breezes into his office to find Mitch, in a
text: pressed suit, intently studying a legal casebook at his desk.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, well, look who's all growns
dialog: up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
text: Dave crashes on the couch, happy. Mitch looks annoyed:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Really? Open-toed sandals at work?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Are...Are you kidding me?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Look, I can't hang right now, okay?
dialog: I've got the mediation in like ten
dialog: minutes.
text: Dave stands right back up, surprised and impressed.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Wow. Okay. Well, I just wanted t
dialog: tell you that if you can get a
dialog: protracted buyout for anything over
dialog: 700 million dollars, take it, okay?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: 700 million, you got it.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (heading for the door)
dialog: Also, I wanted to thank you for
dialog: setting me up with Sabrina. She's
dialog: amazing. I can't wait to see her
scene_heading: AGAIN TONIGHT--
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What?! Dave: No. You can't, you
dialog: have to wait at least a week!
text: Dave reaches for his cellphone as he heads out the door.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Which reminds me, I wanted to call
dialog: to see if she got the flowers...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You sent her flowers after one
dialog: date?! Are you retarded?! Do not
dialog: get me into a relationship, dude!
text: Too late. Dave is already gone. Mitch scowls. Then:
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: You can come out now, Gladys...
text: A second later, GLADYS, in a form-fitting suit and a sexy new
text: bob, crawls out from under his desk. Mitch zips up his pants.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, honey, I don't think this is
scene_heading: WORKING OUT--
text: Gladys YANKS him by the tie and gets in his face, wild-eyed:
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: I haven't had sex in 34 years! This
dialog: isn't over tit I su e' it's over.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: F-Fine, but can you please stop
dialog: following me to the bathroom and
dialog: calling my house late at night and
dialog: sending me all those filthy emails?
dialog: It's, you know, deeply disturbing.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: You need to realize something, boy:
dialog: (whispering in his ear)
dialog: I fucking own you now.
text: The old lady aggressively makes out with Mitch. Her tongue
text: roams from his mouth and madly licks his face, neck, and
text: forehead. Eventually they separate. Mitch looks stunned.
speaker_heading: GLADYS (CONT'D)
dialog: I left you a little souvenir in
dialog: your pocket...
text: She winks and exits. Mitch tentatively reaches into his
text: pocket and pulls out a giant pair of TAN GRANNY PANTIES.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I've created a monster...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES -- DAY
text: A line of limousines roll up to Dave's building and dozens of
text: stone-faced EXECUTIVES from both companies file out...
scene_heading: INT. LAW FIRM -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
text: KEN KINKABE and a slew of his EXECS sit on one side of the
text: massive conference table. Sitting across from them are CEO
text: TED NORTON, Mitch, Flemming Steel III, and a bevy of
text: Amalgamated execs. No one speaks. It's a corporate staredown.
text: Then the mediator, ERIN WALSH, 50's, enters, all business:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: ERIN WALSH
dialog: Thank you all for coming. My name
dialog: is Erin Walsh and I will be
dialog: mediating your claim today...
dialog: Mitch makes the "I'm gonna slit your fucking throat" gesture
text: to Ken Kinkabe, who recoils, what the...:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SIDE ROOM -- LATER
text: The mediation has broken into two separate rooms. The
text: Amalgamated team sits in their shirtsleeves, waiting in tense
text: silence. PAPERS litter the table. They've been here a while.
text: A large tray of sandwiches sits half-eaten on the sideboard.
text: Mitch jams the last piece of a ham sandwich into his mouth,
text: swallows it, and holds up his hands, victorious!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: 14! 14 sandwiches and 9 Diet
dialog: Slice's! Pay up, cocksucker!
text: An EXEC gives him a 5 dollar bill. Mitch waves it in the air
text: and HUMS the Olympic theme song. Flemming just glares at him
dialog: like, you're so fired. Then the mediator enters.
speaker_heading: ERIN WALSH
dialog: Kinkabe agrees in principle to the
dialog: terms of the sale, and valuates
dialog: your company at 725 million
dialog: dollars. This is their last and
dialog: final offer. I'll be outside.
text: She exits. CEO Ted Norton looks at Flemming, intense.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: It's a fair deal. I don't think
dialog: we'll get much more out of them...
text: The other execs all nod. Then Mitch BURRRRPS:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Fuck that, dude, you can do better.
speaker_heading: CEO TED NORTON
dialog: I beg your pardon?
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Shut your mouth, Lockwood--!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Look, this is just like when you're
text: trying to fuck a Jewish girl and
dialog: she keeps saying "no, no, I don't
dialog: want to, I'm really drunk and
dialog: you're not circumcised" but then
dialog: she keeps making out with you and
dialog: not getting out of your Fiero so
dialog: you know she really does want it,
dialog: she just needs to be nudged a bit
dialog: more so she can rationalize it to
dialog: herself and to her God, know what I
dialog: mean? This is just like that.
text: Everyone in the room is speechless. Mitch opens another soda.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus I do not feel good.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: How is this...at all... like that?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: If this was really their final
dialog: offer, they'd leave. Instead,
dialog: they're sticking around, which
dialog: means they have more money to
dialog: spend.
text: Ted looks at his execs. It's not a terrible point...
speaker_heading: CEO TED NORTON
dialog: How much more do you think we can
dialog: get out of them? 10 million? 15?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Fuck it, homey, go for 100.
speaker_heading: CEO TED NORTON
dialog: What?!
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Do not listen to him, Ted, he is
dialog: beyond reckless! If we make too
dialog: large a counter-offer, we risk
text: driving them away.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Enh, can't hurt to ask. You
dialog: wouldn't believe the nasty shit I
dialog: get girls to do just by asking.
dialog: Honestly, it's revolting.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
text: Ted looks genuinely torn. He dabs his sweaty brow.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Seriously, does anyone have a
dialog: Pepto? Because I'm gonna throw.
text: Finally, Ted opens the door and says to the mediator:
speaker_heading: CEO TED NORTON
dialog: Tell Kinkabe we want an extra 100
dialog: million and that is our final
dialog: offer, because we're leaving.
dialog: (loudly, to his execs)
dialog: Fuel the jet. Let's go.
text: The mediator heads off as the execs start packing up their
text: briefcases, bluffing. Mitch points at Ted.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Nice, bro. Way to show some sack.
speaker_heading: CEO TED NORTON
dialog: You had better be right, son, or
dialog: else I am most definitely fired.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Hey, me too. Bones.
text: He extends his fist. Ted ignores him and gathers his things.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES -- A SHORT WHILE LATER
text: Ted Norton and all his execs hurry out of the building,
text: briefcases in hand, looking ashen. They head for their long
text: line of idling limos. Ted hisses to Flemming:
speaker_heading: CEO TED NORTON
dialog: I can't believe we just walked away
dialog: from 725 million dollars.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: For the record, I did not support
scene_heading: THAT DECISION--:
scene_heading: VOICE BEHIND THEM
dialog: Mr. Norton?! Sir?!
text: They turn to see the mediator jogging out of the building.
speaker_heading: ERIN WALSH
dialog: Sir, Mr. Kinkabe has agreed to the
text: 825 million. The deal is closed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
text: A shocked CHEER rises up from the execs! Hugs and handshakes
text: all around! Ted pumps Mitch's hand, ecstatic.
speaker_heading: CEO TED NORTON
dialog: Helluva job! I owe you my life!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Fuck it. Helping ridiculously rich
dialog: people become even more
dialog: ridiculously rich is why I go to
dialog: work every day.
speaker_heading: CEO TED NORTON
dialog: Well, you are bar none the best
dialog: attorney I've ever worked with!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I am?! Fuck, I've never really been
dialog: good at anything before...
text: Mitch considers this a second, then laughs, proud.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Gimme me a hug you tiny capitalist!
text: Mitch hugs Ted and lifts him off the ground, spinning him.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you so much...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DODGERS STADIUM -- DAY

dialog: These are your grandfather's seats?
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Yeah, my family's been coming to

speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Fernando, obviously.

text: Blown away, Dave unzips his jacket to reveal a throwback

speaker_heading: SABRINA (CONT'D)
dialog: No way!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's too soon to say I love you,
dialog: right? That's against the rules?
text: she laughs and kisses him.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: You're cute.
text: Smiling, Dave looks out at the perfect ball field, his arm
text: around Sabrina-he looks profoundly... existentially.. .happy.
text: And then his iPhone RINGS. He answers it:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Mitch Planko who the fuck is this.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON

scene_heading: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh my God, hi!
text: Dave steps away to take the call. Carla does another whippet.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: What's.. .going on?
scene_heading: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
dialog: We found that fountain. It's in our
dialog: San Pedro warehouse.
text: Dave glances back at Sabrina... and winces, conflicted:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: And... and how long is it going to
dialog: be there?
scene_heading: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON
text: It ships out tonight for repairs.
dialog:

scene_heading: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Right. Okay, well thanks, Carla.

dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH: MITCH
text: He's walking down the hall of his law firm, on the phone, as
text: all of his peers step from their offices, APPLAUDING his
text: victory, slapping him on the back, shaking his hand.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You hear about the fountain?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah... We should probably switch
dialog: back, huh?
text: Mitch high-fives a co-worker.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Sure. Right. I mean... the funny
dialog: thing is...I was just starting to
dialog: enjoy your life a little bit...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, and I was just starting to
dialog: enjoy yours, too...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So.. .maybe we should keep going--?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm so glad you said that.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm so glad I said that too! Your
dialog: life rocks!
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I just closed the Amalgamated deal
dialog: for 825 million dollars and for the
dialog: first time ever, people actually
dialog: respect me! It's so weird! Word is
dialog: they're going to make me partner
dialog: tonight! I love your life, dude!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: And I love yours! All the free time
dialog: and the fun activities and I'm
dialog: really growing as an actor and I
dialog: think Sabrina might actually have
dialog: intercourse with me tonight!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dude, you sent her flowers -- she's
dialog: gonna fuck you like a crack whore
dialog: on rent day.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So, wait, what are we talking about
dialog: here? Staying like this... forever:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: No! Course not.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Right! That's crazy...
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Is it though...?
text: Mitch bumps fists with smiling co-workers...
text: Dave watches Sabrina CHEER after a base hit...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's so strange, when the change-up
dialog: happened, we were so focussed on
dialog: switching back into our bodies that
dialog: we didn't even consider that this
dialog: might be exactly what we both
dialog: needed...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, we're fucking morons.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: All right, well, see ya, Dave...
speaker_heading: MITCH

scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Good evening, one and all!
text: The room quiets as a PROJECTION SCREEN lowers behind him.
speaker_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D)
dialog: We are gathered here tonight to

dialog: we've prepared this short, mildly
dialog: embarrassing presentation to

speaker_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D)
dialog: David Andrew Lockwood was born on

text: Jamie squeezes Mitch's hand, a happy mist in her eyes. Mitch
dialog: frowns: this is not my wife...
speaker_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D)
text: Cara came along first, followed by
text: the twins, Peter and Sarah...
text: SHOTS of Dave, wearing scrubs, happily holding his various
text: newborn babies in the hospital flash onto the screen...
text: Cara leans over to Mitch and whispers:
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Look, Daddy, it's you and me!
text: Mitch forces a tight smile, right...
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: And somewhere along the way, we
dialog: were lucky enough to find him...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
text: SHOTS roll of Dave as a lawyer, swearing in at the Bar,
text: arguing in court, and, finally, celebrating today's victory.
text: The image fades as the lights in the room slowly rise...
speaker_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D)
dialog: Industrious. Ambitious. Honorable.
dialog: They were true of him then, they
dialog: are even more true of him now. It
dialog: is my distinct honor to introduce
dialog: our newest partner, David Lockwood.
text: The room breaks into heartfelt APPLAUSE.
speaker_heading: PARTNERS
text: HUZZAH! HUZZAH:
text: Mitch squirms, hating this... Jamie leans over to him:
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I'm so proud of you, baby. You
dialog: worked so hard for this...
text: Mitch winces, knowing just how wrong she is. All around him,
text: the partners stand, APPLAUDING. Mitch stands, a bit dizzy.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I-I'm sorry...I just...
text: He hurries off towards the bathroom. Everyone looks confused.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: Rain pours down outside. Then Dave and Sabrina, soaking wet
text: in their Dodgers gear, run into the apartment.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Oh my god, I'm soaking--
dialog: (taking in barren apartment)
dialog: Wait, are you a single guy?
text: Dave laughs and throws her a towel from the bathroom. She
text: starts drying her hair.
speaker_heading: SABRINA (CONT'D)
dialog: I need a beer and some dry clothes.
text: When Dave passes her, though, she stops him, and starts
dialog: kissing him...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: SABRINA (CONT'D)
dialog: Or maybe...mmm...maybe just a beer.
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. CUT RESTAURANT -- MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT
text: Mitch stands in the restaurant's upscale men's room, staring
text: at himself in the mirror, lost...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: What am I doing...? This isn't my
dialog: life...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Good evening, Mr. Lockwood...
text: He spins to see Gladys in the doorway, vamping, sexy...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh no. Gladys, not now--
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: (approaching, coy)
dialog: I'm not wearing any bloomers...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I thought we talked about not using
speaker_heading: THAT WORD--
text: WHAM! She throws him against the bathroom wall and starts
text: aggressively undressing him.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: What's bothering you, Mr. Lockwood?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Look, Gladys, I love bathroom sex
dialog: as much as the next guy, but--
text: She SPITS in his face, crazy-eyed.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: TELL ME WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (wiping face, a bit scared)
dialog: O-Okay? Well, I guess what's
dialog: bothering me is...I didn't earn any
dialog: of this, you know?
text: Gladys rips open his shirt and starts licking his chest
text: downward until she disappears OUT OF FRAME.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: And I know what you're thinking:
dialog: Mitch, not earning things never
dialog: used to bother you, why does it
dialog: bother you now? And the answer is:
dialog: maybe I'm growing up.
text: We hear the sound of his pants UNZIPPING...
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, sure, I closed the deal
dialog: today, and that felt good, but I
dialog: didn't put in all the years of hard
dialog: work that got Dave to this point,
dialog: you know? Plus, those aren't my
dialog: adorable kids, that's not my
dialog: beautiful wife, you're not even my
dialog: freaky deaky old lady secretary. I
dialog: want to earn this stuff--
text: Just then FLEMMING STEEL III BLOWS IN -- and stops cold:
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: GOOD GOD MAN!
text: GO WIDE to see that Gladys is in the Reverse Wheelbarrow
text: position, her palms on the bathroom floor, her feet against
text: the bathroom wall, with Mitch between her legs, his pants
text: around his ankles. Mitch sees his boss -- and freezes.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Uh oh.
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
text: THE REVERSE WHEELBARROW?.
text: Mitch and Gladys disengage and straighten themselves.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Sir, it's not my fault--!
scene_heading: FLEMMING STEEL III
dialog: Have you forgotten everything you
dialog: learned in law school?! You can't
dialog: screw a direct hire! How can we
dialog: possibly make you a partner now?!
dialog: You're completely exposed--!
text: We hear a GASP from the doorway. Everyone turns to see Jamie
text: -- she's heard the whole thing. Mitch quickly zips his pants.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I thought you might be having an
dialog: affair... but not with Gladys:
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Age-ist.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Jamie, you gotta believe me, this
dialog: woman is a predator--!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: You know what? No. I can't do this
dialog: anymore. I want you out of the
text: house by the time the kids wake up.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Jamie--!
text: Too late. She runs off, choking back tears...
scene_heading: EXT. CUT RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
text: Fastening his belt, Mitch sprints out of the restaurant,
text: desperate -- but Jamie is already SQUEALING away in her car.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: FUCK! Fuck...
text: He stands in the rain, overcome with self-loathing...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: Dave, in dry clothes, sits on his couch, happily drinking a
text: beer and watching SportsCenter. He calls into the bedroom.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You find anything that fits?
text: Then Sabrina appears in the doorway, wearing one of his old
text: tee shirts-and panties.. .and nothing else... she's unreal...
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: This is all I could find...
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: (WIDE-EYED)
dialog: Holy shit.
text: As she bends over to dim the lamp, her tee shirt rides up --
text: exposing her perfectly tan, arched back...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: (hyperventilating, to himself)
dialog: Please don't come, please don't
speaker_heading: COME--
text: And then he stops short. On Sabrina's lower back is a cute
text: tramp stamp tattoo of a BUTTERFLY.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God: a Many-Spotted
dialog: Skipperlinq...
text: And everything comes rushing back. His family. His wife. His
text: entire life. He looks overcome with emotion...
text: Sabrina notices as she slides onto the couch with him.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Is everything okay, baby...?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, no, I just...
text: Dave rubs his temples, overwhelmed...
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't do this.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Why not--?
text: Just then the door flies open and
scene_heading: JAMIE STORMS INSIDE
text: soaking wet, hysterical, her mascara running all over.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Dave is cheating on me!
text: Dave quickly covers his hard-on with a pillow.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No I'm not! I'm so not!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: How could you lie to me, Mitch?!
dialog: We've known each other for--!
text: Then Jamie sees scantily-clad Sabrina and stops.
speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
scene_heading: (COVERING HERSELF)
dialog: Who is this chick?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: (stammering, pointing)
dialog: Umm...she's...uh...this just got
dialog: very complicated...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I'm sorry -- I'm Jamie, the wife of
text: one of Mitch's friends.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Wait, Jamie Lockwood? Dave's wife?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: You know the prick?!
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Yeah, we work together. He cheated
dialog: on you?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Yes, with his secretary, Gladys!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Of all the women in the office, he
dialog: picked her?!
text: Slightly awkward beat.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Look, Jamie, I didn't know about
dialog: Gladys, I swear. But I'm sure she
dialog: means absolutely nothing to Dave--!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: No! No more excuses! The next time
dialog: you see my asshole husband tell him
dialog: that I will never. Ever. Take him
dialog: back, you got that?!
text: Dave nods quickly, terrified.
speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sabrina! It was nice to meet you!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
text: Barely holding it together, Jamie wheels and exits, SLAMMING
text: the door behind her. Dave just stands there, holy shit...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Mitch sadly packs children's snacks and Capri Sun's into a
text: duffel bag in the darkened kitchen, hating himself. Then:
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Daddy?
text: Mitch turns to see Cara, small and fragile in the doorway.
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh, angel, it's nothing. I'm just
dialog: going away for a little while...
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: It's... confusing grown-up stuff--
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Try me.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: O-Okay? Well. I'm leaving because
dialog: I'm a fuck up. Do you know what a
dialog: fuck up is?
speaker_heading: CARA
speaker_heading: (NODDING)
dialog: Like Uncle Mitch.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Right. Right. Well, I thought this
dialog: time was different, you know? I
dialog: thought I actually did something
dialog: right for once. But no, I'm still
dialog: the same old fuck up I've always
dialog: been. Only this time I really
dialog: fucking fucked up, because I fucked
dialog: up my life and my best friend's
dialog: life...
text: Mitch zips up his bag, full of regret -- and finds Cara
text: hugging his leg.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I don't think you're a fuck up.
text: He crouches down and looks at her, getting choked up...
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Thanks, sweetie, but your brain is
dialog: the size of a radish. I am a fuck
dialog: up. I always have been, and I
dialog: always will be. Guys like me, we
dialog: know how to have fun, but we don't
dialog: know how to do the important stuff,
dialog: you know...? Be good, okay, kiddo?
text: She nods, confused. He kisses her head and exits, emotional.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BMW STATION WAGON -- NIGHT
text: The rain still pours down. Jamie, tears streaking her face,
text: drives home in stop-and-go traffic. Then, through her side
text: window, we see Dave sprinting alongside her car, waving!
speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: JAMIE!
text: Not seeing him, she accelerates forward and Dave disappears
text: from view. . .until she stops, and Dave catches up again:
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: JAMIE!
text: Still not seeing him, Jamie accelerates onto
speaker_heading: THE 101 FREEWAY
text: where the stop-and-go traffic moves only slightly faster.
text: Jamie continues quietly CRYING to herself... Then we see
text: DAVE RUNNING ALONG THE SHOULDER OF THE 101
text: in the driving rain, waving his hands and yelling!
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: JESUS JAMIE! LOOK RIGHT!
text: Finally, she glances over, sees Dave -- and startles:
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Mitch?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: PLEASE PULL OVER BEFORE I DIE!
text: Jamie, stunned, pulls onto the shoulder and stops. A second
text: later, Dave hops into the car, soaking wet and panting.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What is the matter with you?!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Look, I know I haven't been a very
dialog: good husband or father recently...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: What are you talking about--?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: But I'm done looking over the fence
dialog: for something better. I've seen
text: what's on the other side, and it's
dialog: great. . .and young... and supple...
dialog: but it's not you. And the truth is
dialog: there will always be another fence
text: with shinier toys on the other
dialog: side, but the only way to be happy
dialog: is to say fuck the fence and just
dialog: appreciate what you have, you know?
dialog: Find the fun with what you got...
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: O-Okay?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm so sorry I stopped appreciating
dialog: you, pumpkin. I love you. And I
dialog: love our weird little kids. And I
dialog: can't believe I ever thought that
dialog: wasn't enough.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Why...are you calling me pumpkin?
text: And then he kisses her. She resists--
speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mitch--?.
text: But he holds her firm. And soon she's kissing him back,
text: confused and overwhelmed and crying...
text: It's emotional and intense for him, too. They finally
text: separate, but remain inches apart, breathing hard.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 113.
text: Jamie stares into his eyes, amazed:
speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Dave?
text: Dave nods. Jamie squints, trying to understand.
speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: But...how?
dialog: Dave shakes his head, I don't know...
speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: So...then ...Mitch was the one...
dialog: with Gladys?
text: Dave nods again. Jamie looks relieved... Then she stops.
speaker_heading: JAMIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait, so who was that hot young
dialog: thing back in the apartment?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Nothing happened, I swear.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Okay. But-we're going to need to
dialog: talk about this.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yes. Totally.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Like, a lot. Like, a-therapy-lot.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Absolutely: therapy, trust falls,
dialog: The Landmark Forum, Eat Pray Love,
dialog: I'll do whatever the fuck you want,
dialog: Jamie, I just want you back...
text: She smiles and kisses him again. And then again.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: I kind of like kissing Mitch.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, I noticed. I'm not sure how I
dialog: feel about this.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
text: (giggling, kissing him again)
dialog: So ...mmm...so what do we do now?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 114.
text: Dave suddenly remembers the fountain and looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh shit! We gotta go!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES -- NIGHT
text: As the rain tapers off, Jamie rockets through LA, running red
text: lights, skidding through turns, splashing through puddles!
scene_heading: EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Jamie and Dave squeal up to their house to see Mitch, out
text: front, sadly trying to pack a Barcalounger into his Ferrari.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Mitch! Get in!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Dave?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Get in!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (squinting inside car)
dialog: Is that Jamie?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Get in the fucking car, dipshit!
text: Mitch, terrified, sprints to the car and hops in.
scene_heading: INT. JAMIE'S STATION WAGON -- NIGHT
text: Jamie races through LA at 80 mph. Dave sits shotgun, and
text: Mitch sits in the back, wide-eyed, scared:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: So, um, are you guys driving me to
dialog: the desert to kill me?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: No. Jamie knows about the change-
dialog: up. We're all good.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
text: It suddenly makes a lot more sense
dialog: why you spent so much time rubbing
dialog: my breastfeeding cream onto my
dialog: boobs every night.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Really, dude?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I was just...trying to be helpful.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: Oh, and what about that time you--?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You know what? I don't want to
dialog: know! Let's just hope we get to the
dialog: warehouse before they ship off our
dialog: fountain...
dialog: Off Dave's concerned look we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SAN PEDRO -- ESTABLISHING -- NIGHT
text: The Port of Los Angeles never sleeps. Huge diesel cranes load
text: and unload freighters as tractor trailers THUNDER to and fro.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE ROW -- NIGHT
text: The street is lined with WAREHOUSES. Beat. Then Jamie skids
text: around the corner, Tokyo Drift-style, in her station wagon!
speaker_heading: DAVE (O.S.)
dialog: There it is!
text: Jamie screeches up to a warehouse labelled L.A. DEPARTMENT OF
text: PARKS; she, Mitch and Dave pile out of the car and run into
scene_heading: THE IMMENSE WAREHOUSE
text: where they sprint down the towering aisles, past park signs,
text: swingsets, jungle gyms -- and finally, fountains.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: There!
text: Four WORKMEN pack the FOUNTAIN OF METIS into a large wooden
text: crate for transport. Jamie, Mitch and Dave run over to them.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Wait! Stop!
text: The workmen stop packing the fountain, confused.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: We...We need that fountain.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN #1
dialog: You.. .need this fountain?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yes. We have to pee in it.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: It's a magic fountain.
text: The workmen just look at them, deadpan. Then Dave reaches
text: into his wallet and starts pulling out CASH--
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: MITCH AND DAVE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE AT THE FOUNTAIN
text: with their pants down around their ankles. Dave starts
text: PEEING. Mitch doesn't. Dave hisses at him:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come on, open the floodgates!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I can't pee with them watching!
text: PAN OVER to the workmen, standing nearby, looking at Mitch
dialog: and Dave like they're total freaks.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well I can't keep going forever!
text: Mitch tilts his head back and quietly sings to himself:
speaker_heading: MITCH
text: The sun is shining all the time,
dialog: Looks like another perfect day, I
dialog: love L.A. We love it! I love L.A...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Are you singing Randy Newman--?
text: Then we hear a second stream of PEE hit the fountain.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Oh thank god.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Okay, quick, we have to hug!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (glancing back at workmen)
dialog: Do we, though?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yes, we have to do everything
dialog: exactly the same! Come on!
text: As they scootch together and put their arms around each
text: other, Mitch calls over to the workmen:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Just so you know, this isn't gay!
dialog: Our penises aren't even touching--!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come on: "I wish I had my old life
dialog: back" on three! One, two:
speaker_heading: MITCH DAVE
dialog: I wish I had my old life I wish I had my old life
dialog: back! back!
text: JUST THEN A THUNDER CLAP CRASHES OUTSIDE
text: The lights in the warehouse flicker. Dave and Mitch finish
text: peeing and slowly zip up, exchanging a worried look...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You think it worked?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How the fuck should I know?
dialog: (waving to workmen)
dialog: Thank you! Have a pleasant evening!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS
text: Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then we hear a
text: second baby join in, even more shrill than the first.
text: Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear:
speaker_heading: JAMIE (O.S.)
dialog: Your turn.
scene_heading: FOLLOWED BY:
speaker_heading: DAVE (O.S.)
dialog: YES!
text: Dave turns on the light, rushes over to the mirror, and
text: touches his face, overjoyed, clearly back in the right body.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: DAVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh thank God. Thank God. Pumpkin,
dialog: it worked! I'm back!
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: (groggy, half-asleep)
dialog: Great, go feed the fucking babies.
text: She rolls over and goes back to sleep. He grins and runs out.
scene_heading: INT. NURSERY -- NIGHT
text: Dave cheerfully sings as he changes Sarah's diaper.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: You just vomited on my hand but I
dialog: love yooooou...
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: Dave bounces down the hallway, a twin in each arm, SCREAMING
text: into each of his ears and taking turns kicking his balls...
text: and he's grinning. In fact, he couldn't look happier.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
text: Mitch slowly wakes up in his empty apartment. He stares at
text: the blank walls, a little bummed...
text: Then he startles when SABRINA rolls over, looking ravishing.
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: Last night was weird.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Wasn't it?
speaker_heading: SABRINA
dialog: So... are you ever going to have sex
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: MITCH
scene_heading: (SLOWLY SMILING)
dialog: Yes. Yes I am.
scene_heading: INT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- DAY
text: Jamie is cleaning up the toys in the living room -- when Dave
text: nuzzles up to her from behind, seductive.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: The twins are down for their nap,
text: Cara is watching The
dialog: Backyardigans...
text: Jamie raises her eyebrow, oh?
speaker_heading: JAMIE
dialog: It's Tuesday...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JAMIE
text: It's Tuesday morning.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, mornings,
dialog: late night, I'm like Denny's, baby,
dialog: I'm open 24-7.
text: She laughs, and he scoops her up and heads upstairs...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DAVE'S NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAYS LATER
text: The sun sets over LA. The MUSIC in the air and the cars
text: lining the street tell us that Dave is hosting a party...
scene_heading: EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BACKYARD
text: A "CONGRATS ON GETTING A JOB, MITCH!" banner hangs from the
text: swingset. Kids race about as adults drink, eat, and mingle.
text: Dave, in jeans and a tee shirt, works the barbecue and talks
text: to Mitch, in a jacket and tie, as he adjusts his crotch:
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I still can't get used to the whole
dialog: underwear thing. It's such a
scene_heading: SUPERFLUOUS LAYER--
text: Just then CARA runs up and hugs her Dad.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Hi Daddy!
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Sugar-bug!
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How's my favorite ballerina?!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 120.
text: Cara turns, takes Mitch's hand, and flips him onto his back.
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I'm not a ballerina anymore, bitch.
text: She races off. Mitch painfully pulls himself to his feet.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Jesus fucking Christ...
text: Dave sees SABRINA, looking angelic in a sundress, chatting
text: with a circle of GUESTS on the patio.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: So. How's it going with Sabrina?
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Great. We just celebrated our two
dialog: week anniversary.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Wow. Good for you.
text: Mitch nods, proud, I know. Swigs his beer.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: You think she's fucking Fernando
dialog: Valenzuela?
text: We see that the man she's talking to is, in fact, Dodger
text: great FERNANDO VALENZUELA, in a pimped-out white suit.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I'm oddly okay with it.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I can't believe they're family
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: I know. She really is perfect--
text: Just then TATIANA and KIEFER SUTHERLAND approach, wheeling
text: her newborn DAUGHTER in a pram.
scene_heading: KIEFER SUTHERLAND
dialog: I gotta go feed her baby, but
dialog: congrats on your new gig, bro.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Thanks, Kiefer. See you guys.
text: Mitch kisses Tatiana on the cheek and they head off.
speaker_heading: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: It's creepy that Kiefer Sutherland
dialog: is like way into other people's
dialog: babies, right?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: Dave flips the burgers.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Thanks again for hooking me up with
