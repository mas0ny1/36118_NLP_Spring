speaker_heading: FADE IN:
dialog: 
text: on an old alarm clock, TICKING, the bells gone, the little hand
text: missing, the big hand indicating twenty-after-something. It is
text: bound with black electrical tape, time-bomb fashion, to a
text: plastic water-filled spray bottle.
dialog: 
text: The alarm RINGS; the bell hammer tugging the piece of kite
text: string tied to the trigger of the bottle; water is misted onto
dialog: the face of--
dialog: 
text: BRIAN STEVENSON, a dark-haired twelve-year-old with eyes that
text: don't miss much. Awake now, he shuts off the alarm and snaps on
text: the Tensor lamp next to his bed. We are
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STEVENSON HOME - ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A huge poster shows the history of train engines. A stairway is
text: cut into the floor. No curtains on the window. A just-past-
text: half moon shines in the night sky.
dialog: 
text: Brian pulls on a pair of thick wool socks. He skates past a
text: cluttered worktable, across the hardwood floor to the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Brian moves quietly past a closed door; on it, a plaque reads
text: 'Eric's Room' above a picture of an antique car.
dialog: 
text: Farther down is another closed door. Brian pauses, listening to
text: the sounds of Mom and Dad arguing; no words can be made out,
text: only the tones, the rise, fall, sharpness of voices.
dialog: 
text: Brian looks away from the door. Prepares for his assault on the
text: stairs. He reaches his foot down--and the step CREAKS loudly.
text: Brian freezes. He moves his foot to the left, puts his weight
text: on it. Silence. He goes right for two more, skips the next
text: stair altogether, making his way to the bottom of the minefield
text: of possible creaks and groans.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: Brian whips up a balogna-mustard-onion sandwich. He glances at
text: the clock--12:27--working under a deadline.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Brian--silently--pushes an armchair up to the television. He
text: turns the volume knob down, holds the remote control an inch
text: from the set, thumbs it. Brian adjusts the volume so it's
text: barely audible-- just in time for the opening of 'Late Night
dialog: With David Letterman.'
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He sits back. Unseen by Brian a quick, subtle movement-- just
text: a shadow, really--heads for the stairs.
dialog: 
text: Brian takes a bite of the sandwich--
dialog: 
dialog: --and then there is a SCREAM that could wake the dead.
dialog: 
text: Brian shoves the chair back, remotes the set off on the run,
text: tosses the control on the couch, and races for the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STEVENSON HOME - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A rambling, two-story midwestern house with screened-in front
text: porch stands dark on a large wooded lot. The SCREAMING
text: continues, going hoarse. A second-story bedroom light comes on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STEVENSON HOME - STAIRWELL
dialog: 
text: Brian is only halfway up the stairs when his escape route is cut
text: off: light from his parents' room spills into the hall. Brian
text: melts back into the shadows. HOLLY and GLEN STEVENSON hurry to
text: the already open door of Eric's room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: No curtains in here, either. ERIC STEVENSON, nine years old
text: with light brown hair and fine features, sits huddled in bed,
text: breathing hard, blinking in the sudden glare of the overhead
dialog: light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Mom! There was a monster!
dialog: 
text: Holly relaxes, smiles. She is a dark-eyed woman on the other
text: side of thirty, pretty giving way to elegant. She gestures to
dialog: Eric.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Skootch over.
dialog: 
text: Holly sits down on the bed beside Eric. She hugs him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: It was just a bad dream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: But I wasn't sleeping!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Sometimes you dream you're awake,
dialog: but you're not.
dialog: 
text: Glen, slightly older than Holly, bearded, stands slumped against
text: the door frame. He is a polished man but worn, the veteran of
dialog: too many such late night disturbances.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: It was probably just the house
dialog: settling. You're not used to it,
dialog: yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It wasn't the house--there was a
dialog: monster! It zoomed in from the
dialog: hall and went under my bed!
dialog: 
text: Holly and Glen exchange a look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Eric...when you dream, it's just
dialog: your brain's way of sorting out
dialog: things you learned during the day.
dialog: So if you found out something--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I found out there's a monster
dialog: under my bed! It ran in from the
dialog: hall--it grabbed my ankle!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: There's no monster under your bed.
dialog: Here.
dialog: 
text: She gets down on one knee and--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No, Mom! Don't!
dialog: 
text: --sticks her arm into the under-the-bed. She sweeps it back and
text: forth, pulls it out. It is rather dusty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: See? No monsters.
dialog: (notices the dust,
dialog: brushes it off)
dialog: All the dust bunnies scare 'em
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (a new threat)
dialog: ...bunnies?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Brian rolls his eyes. He sneaks toward the attic stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S BEDROOM
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: There are no bunnies and no
dialog: monsters. There's nothing under
dialog: your bed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Maybe we should get the
dialog: flashlight.
dialog: 
text: Eric crosses his arms and gives Glen a grave nod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Holly, if we humor him--
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: All right.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Brian commando-rolls into the bathroom, disappearing just before
text: Glen steps into the hall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: Holly pulls the covers up to Eric's chin, tucking him in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You want to know a secret? The
dialog: monsters are more afraid of you
dialog: than you are of them.
dialog: 
text: Eric looks very doubtful. He inches the covers down to free his
dialog: arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Once you realize they don't exist,
dialog: they're gone. That's a lot of
dialog: power. I wish I could do that to
dialog: the heating bill.
dialog: 
text: She pulls the covers back up to Eric's chin. Glen returns,
text: presents the flashlight to Eric.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Easy on the batteries, kid.
dialog: 
text: Eric takes the flashlight, grips it tightly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: We'll leave the hall light on and
text: the door open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY/GLEN
dialog: 'night, Eric.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: G'night...
dialog: 
text: Glen turns off the room light.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: The pair move toward their bedroom door, speaking softly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Do you think he heard us?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Of course he heard. What do you
dialog: think scared him? He was--
dialog: 
text: The clicking shut of the bedroom door cuts her off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: Eric lies on his side, back to the door, eyes wide. He hears
text: something. He can't look. Then he jumps, arms flailing, a
text: scream on its way--cut off by a hand clamping over his mouth.
text: He trains the flashlight on his ankle--
dialog: 
text: --a hand is wrapped around it; the beam runs past the wrist, up
text: the arm, to Brian's face, grinning out of the darkness. His
text: attitude is that of a friendly co-conspirator, a helpful ally in
dialog: the kids vs. parents cold war.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: They were lying.
dialog: 
text: Eric stares at him, his mouth still covered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
text: There is a monster.
dialog: 
text: Eric shakes his head 'no' emphatically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It went for your ankle, right? It
dialog: got mine. Where do you think I
dialog: got this?
dialog: 
text: Brian takes his hands away. Sticks out one leg, pulls up his
text: pajamas cuff, revealing the old, ugly scar on his ankle. Eric
text: stares at it, a little panicked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You got that when your foot got
dialog: caught in the spokes. When you
dialog: were little!
dialog: 
text: Brian looks at him and smiles pityingly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's what
text: (jerks his head towards
dialog: their parents' room)
dialog: they want you to think.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Eric, eyes widening, turns to look in the direction Brian jerked
text: his head. Brian's smile gets bigger as he backs toward the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: They're supposed to be comforting--
dialog: they're parents. I'm your
dialog: brother.
dialog: (reaches for the knob)
dialog: Here--I'll close this...you really
dialog: ought to keep the lights down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (matter-of-fact)
dialog: Because monsters are just like
dialog: moths...they're attracted to
dialog: light.
dialog: 
text: Brian smiles helpfully, and pulls the door shut.
dialog: 
text: The flashlight beam cuts across the dark room. Eric turns it up
text: to look into it, his worried face now lit from below. He
text: glances quickly around the room. All is silent. Screwing up
text: his courage, he snaps off the light, and the room goes BLACK.
dialog: 
text: Eric's soft, worried back-of-the-throat whimper floats out of
dialog: the darkness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM - MORNING - CLOSE ON
dialog: 
text: a gold pocketwatch. The face is unique: a disc with a wedge cut
text: out is set into a numbered ring. The wedge turns, revealing an
text: old-fashioned drawing of a benign sun for daylight hours, a
text: malevolent man-in-the-moon in a starry sky for the nighttime.
dialog: 
text: Brian sits at a worktable covered with disassembled mechanical
text: items. He pores over the dismantled watch, cleaning the pieces
dialog: with Dust-off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY (O.S.)
dialog: Brian! Breakfast.
dialog: (Brian doesn't respond)
dialog: Brian!
dialog: 
text: Brian reluctantly sets the watch onto its stand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Holly fits one last dish into the dishwasher; Glen finishes his
text: coffee and grapefruit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Eric, head down, intently eats his cereal. Brian breezes into
text: the room--then slows, sensing tension. Brian eases down next to
dialog: Eric.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I hope whatever you watched last
dialog: night was worth your allowance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: ...huh?
dialog: 
text: Holly turns on the dishwasher.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: We found the sandwich.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What sandwich?
dialog: 
text: Eric winces--he knows the shit has just hit the fan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Brian, you are the only person in
dialog: this house who eats bologna and
dialog: onions. Every time you get
dialog: caught, you think you can lie your
dialog: way out of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: You want to end up a politician?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: ...no.
dialog: 
text: Water pipes, visible through a hole above the sink, start to
text: knock. Holly, expecting this, turns on and off the hot water.
text: The knocking subsides.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Gotta catch the bus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: This conversation is not over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's not fair you get mad at me
dialog: every time you get mad at Brian.
dialog: 
text: The pipes start knocking again. Holly takes a deep breath,
text: gestures that Eric can go. He grabs his lunch bag and leaves.
dialog: 
text: Holly repeats the hot water ploy; it doesn't work. She tries it
text: once more; again, nothing. She shuts down the dishwasher; the
dialog: knocking stops for good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Damn! Damn, damn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Glen goes to her. Brian is torn between escape--and his lunch.
text: He edges toward it. Glen puts an arm around Holly's shoulder,
text: tries to cheer her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: The plumber'll be out next week.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Great. Can I leave him the
dialog: dishes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Just keep saying to yourself:
dialog: 'It's our dream house.'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: I never dreamed of seventeen
dialog: hundred dollars in plumbing
dialog: problems.
dialog: 
text: Glen leans against the cupboard; a strange look crosses his
text: face. He turns: melted strawberry ice cream stains his shirt,
text: and drips out of the cupboard. He pulls open the door--a soupy
text: half gallon of Carnation sits on a stack of dishes.
dialog: 
text: Brian looks incredulously at the gooey mess, snags his lunch,
dialog: and beelines for the door--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: You're a deadman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I didn't do it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Just like the sandwich.
dialog: 
text: Glen, disgusted, plucks the carton out of the cupboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: ...okay, it was my sandwich-- but
dialog: I didn't have any ice cream! You
dialog: always blame me for everything--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: Somebody puts scuff marks on the
text: doors kicking them open. And
dialog: somebody sticks gum under the
dialog: table--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Not me.
dialog: 
text: Glen throws an ice cream-bloated sponge into the sink.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: We'll let this go as an accident.
dialog: But I'm laying down the law. No
dialog: more intentionally disobeying the
dialog: rules. You know the difference
dialog: between right and wrong. Start
dialog: acting like it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (downcast)
dialog: ...yes, sir.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL
dialog: 
text: Brian sits on the stairs, bookpack between his knees. Glen, tie
text: over his shoulder, buttoning a fresh shirt, hurries past. He
text: kisses Holly goodbye and goes out the front door.
dialog: 
text: Holly turns, regards her glum son. Sits down beside him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Brian, your Dad and I are worried.
dialog: You and Eric have been at the new
dialog: school the same amount of time.
dialog: Eric's already made some friends--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Grandpa was my friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Yes, I know. I know you miss
dialog: Grandpa. We all do.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you should get out more. Find
dialog: somebody to play with.
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: The lawyer who handled the estate--
dialog: Mr. Coleman? He had a son about
dialog: your age.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (stating a fact)
dialog: Ronnie Coleman is a toad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: He seemed like a nice kid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: We can have him over for milk and
text: dead flies.
dialog: 
text: Holly reacts with a small smile despite herself--then they hear
text: a LONG, SCRAPING, CRUMPLING METAL SOUND from outside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STEVENSON HOME - DRIVEWAY
dialog: 
text: Brian's Beachcruiser lays twisted in back of the idling Honda.
text: Glen sternly guides Brian out through the garage. Holly follows
text: as far as the garage door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Right there. What do you see?
dialog: 
text: Brian spots the bike, breaks away from Glen. He stares down at
text: the ruined bike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You ran it over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Guess why?
dialog: 
text: Brian looks at him; a light dawns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh no--no way.
dialog: (pointing to the side of
dialog: the garage)
dialog: It was there! I parked it right
dialog: there!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: It was behind the car. I didn't
dialog: see it this time because it was
dialog: lying flat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: My bike...all those stupid seeds
dialog: I had to sell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: You're lucky--the car wasn't
dialog: damaged. As it stands you are
dialog: grounded for a month, no TV for a
dialog: month, and you can consider
dialog: yourself at poverty level until
dialog: the next century.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Isn't that a little rough?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Don't make me the villain here,
dialog: Holly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Wait...I'm out my bike. Your
dialog: car's fine. You ran over my bike
dialog: and I get punished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Don't get smart.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Glen gets in the car as Brian drags the bike out of the way.

speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: education.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Eric and his friend TODD walk toward the bus stop, notebooks and
text: lunchbags in hand. Todd's parents force him to wear dress
text: shoes; he compensates by scuffing them at every opportunity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: So you didn't really see
dialog: anything... All you felt was,
dialog: like, an eerie presence?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yeah. Eerie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: It didn't like, go in the closet,
dialog: or near it, or even look at it for
dialog: a second or anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Nope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: --so this is an exclusively under-
dialog: the-bed phenomenon we're dealing
dialog: with here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yeah. Under my bed.
dialog: 
text: They join other kids at the bus stop. Todd snaps his fingers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Trolls! Trolls live under
text: bridges. This lives under a bed.
dialog: It could be some sort of...sub-
dialog: species, mutant troll.
text: (he punches his fist
dialog: into his palm)
dialog: That's it.
dialog: 
text: The bus pulls up; its doors hiss open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I just want to get rid of it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Maybe if you pound a stake through
dialog: its heart..?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Nah...that only works on vampires.
dialog: 
text: They solemnly ponder this subject.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I think that'd work on anything.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BUS - DAY
dialog: 
text: half-filled with kids. Todd and Eric find seats as the bus
text: begins to move--but then it slows to a stop for a late-arrival:
text: Brian. He swings into his seat as the bus lurches forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Why aren't you riding your bike?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Let's talk about that. You've got
dialog: two choices: you can lie, and die
dialog: slow and painful. Tell the truth,
dialog: and I'll be merciful.
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: You'll die quick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Dad ran over my bike because you
text: put it in the driveway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No way. Your bike?
dialog: 
text: The bus slows for its next stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Looks like it's gonna be slow and
dialog: painful. We'll start with
dialog: starvation and work our way up.
dialog: 
text: In an unstoppably quick motion, Brian grabs Eric's lunch and
text: tosses it out the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: My lunch! You stupid! I didn't
dialog: do anything...
dialog: (he sees Brian is
dialog: serious)
dialog: Your bike's really thrashed?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I put it away. Mom and Dad sure
dialog: didn't move it. That leaves
dialog: (he points at Eric)
dialog: you. I'm tired of you getting me
dialog: in trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I don't touch your bike.
dialog: (Brian grabs Eric by the
dialog: shirt)
dialog: If I did, you'd beat me up!
dialog: 
text: Brian pulls back a little; Eric is sincere. Kids file on the
dialog: bus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What about the ice cream? You
dialog: snuck some ice cream last night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (definite)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Brian and Eric regard each other, both frowning, puzzled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (confident)
dialog: The monster.
dialog: 
text: Brian and Eric look at Todd, who nods his head, all-knowing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: That's it! That's what it was
dialog: doing!
dialog: 
text: Brian sighs, rubs his eyes in a long-suffering gesture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: He told you about the killer
text: attack bunnies under his bed?

speaker_heading: RONNIE (O.S.)
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Who's 'Eric?'
dialog: 
text: RONNIE COLEMAN, a sixth grade version of Pete Rose comes up the

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Who's the 'Eric' that threw his
dialog: lunch at me?
dialog: 
text: Todd's horror-stricken look throws a spotlight on Eric. Ronnie,
text: grape juice staining his jersey, zeros in on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It's my lunch, but I didn't throw
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Who did?

text: Eric points at Brian's back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: My brother.

speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Stevenson? He's your brother?

dialog: 
text: Alone in the room, KIERSTEN DEVERAUX, a crush-inducing twelve
text: year old, raises a Polaroid camera to take a picture of a just-
text: beginning-to-bloom cereus. It is inside a homemade plywood box;
text: the hinged side stands open. A blackout curtain, lifted, lines
text: the box; a lamp is attached to the roof.
dialog: 
text: The Polaroid WHIRS, but doesn't spit out a photo.
dialog: 
text: Kiersten frowns, goes to a closed door marked TEACHERS ONLY.
text: She takes a key out of her pocket, unlocks the door.

scene_heading: INT. BOOK/SUPPLY ROOM
dialog: 
text: Kiersten takes a pack of film from a metal cabinet. She shuts

speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: What?

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: KIERSTEN

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM
dialog: 
text: Brian doesn't hear the insult, intent on firming up this new

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh, come on, Kiersten. I saw you.
dialog: You were scamming the teacher's
dialog: edition.
dialog: 
text: Kiersten doesn't give him a lot of attention.

speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: I was not. I'm allowed in there--

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: A key? You have a key?

dialog: And you weren't looking at the

speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: (explaining flatly)

dialog: See? It's blooming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What a breakthrough.
dialog: 
text: Kiersten finishes reloading the camera, and takes a picture of
text: the cactus. On the counter are a dozen or so snapshots of the
text: cactus. Despite himself, Brian is interested. He glances at
dialog: the photos.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
text: It's a cereus. They only bloom at

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah? This one's broken.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Hey, y'know what...
dialog: 
text: He gathers up the photos into a stack, sorting them into proper
text: order as he does so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: If you mounted the camera in one
dialog: place...upside down--
dialog: 
text: Brian reverses the stack, holds them by the wide border.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You could take a bunch of pictures
dialog: and make it like a movie.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You can get back to me on that.

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Switch rooms with me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You just want my room.
dialog: 
text: Eric and Todd pause--then Eric jumps back in step with Brian.

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Nuh-uh...I want you to prove me

speaker_heading: TODD

speaker_heading: ERIC

text: Brian cocks an eyebrow.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The door, propelled by a kick, slams open. The kick leaves a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: You have to stay the whole night.

speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: Oh, stop. You're frightening me.
dialog: 
text: On top of the bedding in the basket is a shoe-box lid which
text: contains Brian's pocketwatch and paraphernalia. He lifts it out
text: and sets in on Eric's small desk, sits down--

speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Yeah, we'll make sure he won't!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: So get up here! Use the trellis.
dialog: 
text: Todd regards the trellis. Ivy snaking in and out of it, the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Gonna let Todd in.

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: (addressing them both)
dialog: Do either of you have the good

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Well, if you run across them, put
dialog: them back where they belong.
dialog: 
text: Eric nods and takes off. Brian turns back to the watch. Glen
text: steps forward, watches over Brian's shoulder.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON THE WATCH as Brian, using a jeweler's screwdriver,
text: tightens a mechanism. He releases a tiny lever. Minute gears
text: spin; ticking can be heard, distinct from the soft whirring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: You got it running!
dialog: 
text: Brian grins as Glen picks up the watch, examines it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Grandpa'd be happy. You have his
dialog: mechanical touch. It must skip a
dialog: generation.
dialog: 
text: Brian's smile turns a little sad. Glen hands the watch back.

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Eric and Todd climb the stairs into Brian's room, intimidated

dialog: 
text: Eric surveys the disassembled stuff on Brian's worktable. He
dialog: reaches for an electric train--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN (O.S.)
dialog: Don't touch that!
dialog: 
text: Brian steps forward, takes the train, sets it back down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You can use the bed, and you can
text: walk from the bed to the door and
dialog: back, and that's it.
dialog: 
text: Brian grabs the pillow off his stripped bed, turns to leave. He
text: stops at the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You can touch my light--but only
dialog: to turn it off.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And no fart contests.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brian stops in the doorway, stares at the bed. In a decisive
text: move he turns out the light, forces himself to walk calmly to
text: the bed and sit on the edge. He jerks his legs up, lies down.
dialog: 
text: Brian looks at it, then pulls it in a bit. He lies back, closes
dialog: his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (as derisively as he can

dialog: ...monsters.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, smoothly, as if with a mind of its own, the foot slips

scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S BEDROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: The waxing moon shines brightly. Brian comes awake with a
text: start. He tilts his head, listening--muffled, indistinct sounds
text: of laughter can be heard, fading quickly to silence.
dialog: 
text: Puzzled, frowning, Brian starts to swing a leg out of bed. He
text: stops--thinks--then pushes the covers away from him until they
text: touch the floor, covering the space beneath the bed.
dialog: 
text: A long step, and Brian is safely in the middle of the room. He
text: goes to the door, keeping an eye on the bed, unable to see
text: beneath it--the covers block his view.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Brian sidles out of the door, listens--he hears a muffled voice,
text: and moves silently toward it, to the vent in the wall by the
text: attic stairs. The voice becomes clearer as he nears:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD (O.S.)
dialog: (low and scary-like)
dialog: So she goes out, and five minutes
dialog: go by, then ten...
dialog: (Brian reaches the vent)
dialog: So the girl's waiting for her
dialog: roommate to get back, and she's
dialog: getting real scared...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM
dialog: 
text: The vent is flush to the floor. Todd is in his mummy bag, only
text: his face visible, sitting across from Eric. The Tensor lamp is
text: the campfire between the two, the gooseneck bent down so that
text: the lip of the shade nearly touches the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (low and scary-like)
dialog: --oh, yeah, the room's on the
dialog: second floor--so she's waiting,
text: and suddenly, from outside, she
dialog: hears 'thump-THUMP...thump-THUMP.'
dialog: So she gets real brave and she
text: sneaks over to the door and she
dialog: hears it again: 'thump-
dialog: THUMP...thump-THUMP!'
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM
dialog:

text: herself up by her chin 'thump-

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: ...wow...
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY

text: Brian shakes his head, disbelieving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD (O.S.)
dialog: It happened to a girl a friend of

dialog: of his hand: 'thump-THUMP...thump- THUMP.' All sound from
text: upstairs ceases. Brian grins darkly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: Brian comes through the door--and stops dead in his tracks.
dialog: 
text: The bedcovers have been thrown all the way back, away from the
text: floor, onto the mattress--they lie in a long pile against the
text: wall. Brian stares.
dialog: 
text: The black inkiness of the under-the-bed gapes at him.
dialog: 
text: Brian lowers himself into a half-stoop, half-crouch, peering
dialog: into the darkness. Is there something there?
dialog: 
text: Brian throws a look at the desk--the stand is empty; his
text: pocketwatch is gone. Brian's eyes go wide. He looks-- and sees
text: it under the bed, just on the edge of the shadow.
dialog: 
text: Brian reaches his hand up along the door frame to the light
text: switch. He flips the switch--
dialog: 
text: and A MONSTROUS, HORRIFIC, CHILLING HOWL comes from right behind
text: him. Brian spins in the still-dark room. A blue glow flickers
text: behind the door.

speaker_heading: TODD

scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S BEDROOM
dialog:

dialog: 
text: --the family's 25" diagonal television set, sitting on its side,
text: plugged into the switched socket, tuned to an SCTV rerun
dialog: featuring Count Floyd.
dialog: 
text: Brian snaps off the light switch (shutting off the set) and
text: whirls, ducking to look under-the-bed.
dialog: 
text: The watch chain becomes taut--the watch is pulled smoothly out
text: of view, into the deep shadows under the bed.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON Brian, a cold sweat on his forehead, all doubt drained
dialog: from his face: Eric was right.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Brian darts his head out; a light shines from beneath his

speaker_heading: ERIC (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, Brian! You okay?
dialog:

dialog: 
text: D. Heaps of refuse blot out the horizon. Brian spots

text: More crunches. Brian turns his head s-l-o-w-l-y, looking as far
text: out of the corners of his eyes as possible. The crunching
text: pauses, then turns into the unmistakable sound of chomping.
dialog: Whatever is out there, it sure likes Doritos (Nacho Cheese).
dialog: 
text: Brian stealthily reaches one hand down to his knife. He
text: positions the handbrake, waiting. He doesn't breath.
dialog: 
text: The alarm clock is triggered; it RINGS. Brian cuts the rubber
text: band. The brake pads open. The rope releases. Sprockets spin.
text: Springs snap. The trap works; the bed collapses, slamming to
text: the floor; Brian spins, the flashlight in his hand and on--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The beam catches something rushing straight towards Brian,
text: straight for the under-the-bed; a brief impression of yellow
text: eyes--then it is gone, back into the dark.
dialog: 
text: Brian snaps the light across the room, almost catching something
text: in the peripheral of the beam.
dialog: 
text: The alarm, ringing shrilly throughout, begins to whir down.
text: Brian makes long sweeping arcs with the flashlight,
text: systematically covering the room. Nothing.
dialog: 
text: The alarm is spent. Silence.
dialog: 
text: Brian peers into the dark. A shape rises up behind him. Brian
text: becomes aware of it just as an arm slaps across his chest--
text: Brian shouts, and an instinctive jerk becomes a passable judo
text: throw, propelling the shape over his shoulder to the floor.
dialog: 
text: Snapping the flashlight around in a two-handed pistol-grip,
text: Brian pins the shape in the beam--
dialog: 
text: And the room light goes on. Brian looks over; Glen is standing
text: in the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Dad! The monst--
dialog: 
text: The word stops as Brian looks back at what is in his beam: an
text: innocuous pile of clothes: T-shirts, jeans, and sweaters, all
text: slightly yellowish in tint--and one ratty red bathrobe...and a
dialog: Washington Senators baseball cap.
dialog: 
text: Brian's eyes go wide.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: --er...
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON Glen as his eyes track from one corner of the room to
text: another, his expression going from tired annoyance to shock to
text: disbelief to wide-awake anger. He focuses on
dialog: 
text: Brian, on the collapsed bed, flashlight out in front of him, one
text: foot on the floor. Brian shifts his weight slightly; a chip
text: crunches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Christ, Brian--I was counting on
dialog: you...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I give up.
dialog: 
text: Brian, intimidated by Glen's forcefulness, starts to feel bad,
dialog: but then remembers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Wait a minute! I...there is--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: A monster? It's a pile of
dialog: clothes, for Chrissakes.
dialog: 
text: He kicks the clothes. Unseen by Glen, two folds in the clothes
text: open like eyelids and stare up hatefully. Brian's eyes widen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: The next time you leave your room
dialog: will be the first time you vote.
dialog: 
text: Brian is speechless. He rubs his eyes, looks at the clothes.
dialog: They look normal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: But--
dialog: 
text: Glen snaps off the light and reaches for the door knob; it comes
text: off in his hand. He gives Brian one more glare, then pulls the
dialog: door shut.
dialog: 
text: Brian swallows, keeps the light unsteadily on the clothes. He
text: stretches for the hockey stick. Cautiously, he jabs the stick
text: into the clothes, barely. Nothing happens.
dialog: 
dialog: He gives the clothes a good poke. That does it. The sleeve
text: snaps the hockey stick out of his hands, across the room.
dialog: 
text: Brian half-leaps, half-sprawls back; he loses the flashlight.
dialog: 
text: The clothes gather in on themselves, start to change--
dialog: 
text: Brian slams the laundry basket over the clothes pile, throws his
text: body on top of it. The basket forces itself up off the floor.
text: Brian is pitched hard, heels-over-head, to the ground.
dialog: 
text: The basket continues to rise. Brian gapes as the thing becomes
text: visible: long, flat feet with extraordinarily long toes. A
text: yellowish hand curls out from under the lip of the basket and
text: throws it off.
dialog: 
text: The Monster From Under the Bed glowers at Brian, eyes aglow with
text: malevolent intelligence. The ratty old red bathrobe still
text: exists; the monster wears it with a certain panache. He grins,
text: face splitting in half, revealing jagged rows of teeth. His
speaker_heading: name is MAURICE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Boo.
dialog: 
text: Brian stifles a scream. He grabs the rug and pulls hard. The
text: monster's feet go out from under him; he lands on his back.
dialog: 
text: Brian scrambles away, onto the bed, pulls in his ankles as a
text: claw-like hand slashes down, making four ragged tears in the
text: mattress. Brian leaps over the monster, runs for the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The knob has been removed; the door won't open. Brian looks
text: despairingly at his own handiwork, lunges for the window.
dialog: 
text: Halfway across the room, fishing line wraps around Brian's
text: ankle, the still-attached alarm clock acting as weight for the
text: makeshift bolo. The monster, grinning, reels Brian in.
dialog: 
text: Brian reaches, desperately trying to extricate his leg. Working
text: frantically, inches out of reach, Brian gets loose from the
text: line. He rolls away, grabbing up the hockey stick.
dialog: 
text: The monster looks down at the clock dangling at the end of the
text: line. The minute hand is nearly straight up. Brian sees the
text: monster throw a look at the window. Dawn washes the sky.
dialog: 
text: The monster drops the clock and rushes for the bed. Brian,
text: thinking fast, leaps between the monster and the bed,
text: brandishing the stick. The monster pulls up short. The two
dialog: gauge each other. For all its ugliness, the monster is not much
text: taller than Brian. It raises its claws.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'll scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: That's good--let's both scream.
dialog: Let's get your dad back in here.
dialog: 
text: The monster takes a deep breath--then lets it out in a gasp as
text: Brian slugs him in the stomach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (a hiss)
dialog: Shaddup.
dialog: 
text: The monster raises a hand, takes some time to recover.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Whoa, time out...
dialog: 
text: Brian pauses...then sees that the monster is furtively edging
text: toward the bed. Brian glances out the window. He sees the
text: lighting sky, smiles. He steps in front of the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah. Why don't we just wait?
dialog: 
text: The monster recovers amazingly fast, growls and feints, ramming
text: Brian out of the way with a shoulder. He makes it to the bed--
text: just as the sun edges over the horizon.
dialog: 
text: The monster slips his fingers in under the bed frame and pulls
text: up. His fingers pass through the box-spring and mattress--his
text: hands have become two-dimensional, intangible.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brian jumps onto the mattress. The monster panics. Brian
text: levers the stick between the bed and the monster, pries him
text: away. The monster tries to move, but his now-intangible feet
text: have no purchase. He falls, hands inches from the bed.
dialog: 
text: A gradient effect, beginning at the monster's fingertips, turns
text: him from yellow to gray to black, transforming him into his own
text: shadow. Brian stares as the arms and legs flatten.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What's happening?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: What d'you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're dying. The sunlight--
dialog: you're a vampire!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Puh-leez. No such thing...as
dialog: vampires...Gotta get back under
dialog: the bed...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No way. You wrecked my bike. You
dialog: stole my watch. You been pulling
dialog: stuff, trying to get me in
dialog: trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (hurt; defensive)
dialog: That's my job.
dialog: 
text: Brian sucks on his lower lip, thinking. He looks toward the
text: window. The sun has almost cleared the horizon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: What, you never did anything just
dialog: for a laugh?
dialog: 
text: Maurice's eyes, wide and pleading, lock with Brian's. The two
text: gaze at each other, until finally the monster's eyelids drop
dialog: closed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Damn.
dialog: 
text: Brian sighs at his victory turned hollow. With both hands, he
text: raises a corner of the bed, watching the monster, not at all
dialog: sure if it will do any good.
dialog: 
text: Maurice's eyes open slightly. His gaze flickers to the bed; he
text: tries to move but can't. Straining to hold the bed up, Brian
text: puts his arm around Maurice's still-solid torso and pushes him
text: into the shadow.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brian lets the bed drop. He collapses to the floor.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the bed lifts, raising away from the floor like a
text: trapdoor. Brian jumps back. The monster, fully recovered and
text: quite pleased, holds the bed easily above his head with one arm.
text: He looks like he is standing waist deep in an inky pool.
dialog: 
text: His gaze flickers to the window--just as the sun clears the
text: horizon, he grins a yellow grin at Brian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: Brian--
dialog: (beat)
dialog: 'Catch ya later.
dialog: 
text: He disappears, the bed dropping to the floor.

scene_heading: INT. STEVENSON HOME - HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: In the master bedroom, Glen sits at a desk covered with bills,
text: a printing calculator and the check book. Holly holds an
text: invoice. The tone of the argument is not harsh-- just hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: It's certainly the liberal
dialog: solution to a problem. Throw
dialog: money at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Well, since I seem to be
dialog: responsible for getting this place
dialog: fixed up--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: When we made the decision to live
dialog: here, we knew it meant a lot of
dialog: work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: For both of us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I'm commuting four hours a day.
dialog: Do you think I enjoy that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: You don't seem to enjoy much of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: (moving to shut the

dialog: Maybe there's not that much to

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Down the hall, Brian steps out of Eric's room with the laundry
text: basket. Glen spots him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Where do you think you're going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I finished cleaning. I was going
dialog: back up to my room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Well, get there and stay there.
dialog: 
text: Glen shuts the door. A beat; Brian turns to the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brian lies on his back, wide awake, staring up into the
text: darkness. Suddenly, another one of Eric's screams pierces the
text: silence. Brian starts, then frowns, a little scared. A pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE (O.S.)
dialog: (from under the bed)
dialog: Brian...hey, Brian.
dialog: 
text: Brian's eyes go a little wider. He doesn't move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE (O.S.)
dialog: Yo! Brian! I'm back! Why'd you
dialog: switch rooms again with that
dialog: whiffleball? You know he sucks
dialog: his thumb?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: C'mon, I know you're up there. I
dialog: can hear you holding your breath.
dialog: 
text: Brian begins breathing again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, fine. Here--I brought you
dialog: something.
dialog: 
text: A thing lands on Brian's chest. He squirms out from under it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE (O.S.)
dialog: Catch ya' later!
dialog: 
text: A clatter from below, and then silence. Brian gingerly picks up
text: Maurice's gift, holds it up into a spill of moonlight: his
text: grandfather's pocketwatch. Surprised, he looks down over the
text: side of the bed. Nothing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND - KICKBALL DIAMOND - DAY
dialog: 
text: A kickball game in progress. Ronnie is on second base; Brian is
dialog: the catcher.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A lanky red-headed girl kicks a grounder. Ronnie rounds third
text: and heads for home. Brian, in the baseline, waits for the
text: throw. Ronnie accelerates, lowers his shoulder and slams into
text: Brian, sending him sprawling in the dirt.
dialog: 
text: Ronnie stands up, grins at Brian, turns toward his dugout.
dialog: 
text: The throw from first rolls in. Brian picks it up. With deadly
text: aim, he hurls the ball as hard as he can, nailing Ronnie in the
text: back of the head. Ronnie stumbles, recovers, spins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You didn't hit the plate. You're
dialog: outta--
dialog: 
text: Ronnie has already launched himself at Brian, and the two go
text: down into the dust amid shouts of 'Fight! Fight!'
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STEVENSON HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brian gets out of the car, walks toward the house, the condemned
text: man escorted to the chair--by Glen and Holly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I want to know why you threw the
text: ball at him in the first place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: To get him out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: No mouth, Brian. The principal
dialog: said the game was over, and then
dialog: you threw it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Christ. A new school, and more
dialog: fighting. Do you have any idea
dialog: how disappointed we are in you?
text: (he opens the front
dialog: door)
dialog: You're never going to get out of
dialog: your room.
dialog: 
text: A look of pure anger crosses Brian's face as he goes inside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brian trudges up the stairs, to his desk. He digs into his
text: pocket, pulls out the pocketwatch, flips it open--
dialog: 
text: --pieces of shattered crystal rain down. Brian is shocked: the
text: crystal is gone, the casing dented...the hands still. The
text: benign Sun is frozen, peeking out of the wedge.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brian grips the watch, fists going white-knuckled--he spins to
text: throw it against the wall, stops. A deep breath. He sits down,
text: starts to take the watch apart, blinking back tears.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: Brian is asleep, his head on the desk. Just the desk lamp is
text: on. Suddenly the bulb SHATTERS, throwing the room into
text: darkness, snapping Brian awake. He whirls--
dialog: 
text: Maurice stands silhouetted in moonlight, twirling a slingshot by
text: the elastic. He hitches his Senators cap back on his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: The name's Maurice, but back home
dialog: they call me 'Dead-eye.'
dialog: 
text: Brian scrabbles for the light switch he has rigged to a bunch of
text: extension cords--he flips it--
dialog: 
text: LIGHT FLOODS THE ROOM: two shadeless floor lamps, super-8 movie
text: lamp, mechanic's light, the overhead light; extension cords
text: criss-cross the floor; a string of miniature Christmas lights
text: circle the room, blinking, casting colored shadows.
dialog: 
text: Maurice disappears. The slingshot clatters onto the floor
text: beside the same pile of clothes from before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It's like when your eyeballs get
dialog: bigger when it gets darker. If
dialog: the lights go on, you turn into
dialog: clothes. Right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (like his mouth is
dialog: filled with cotton)
dialog: Oh, c'mon--we did the man-versus-
dialog: monster thing to death all ready.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Go away. Don't bother me anymore,
dialog: or Eric. I got enough problems
dialog: without you sneaking around.
dialog: (beat; it registers)
dialog: Maurice?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: That's my name, don't wear it out.
dialog: C'mon, Brian. I gave back the
dialog: watch.
dialog: 
text: Brian considers. He flips the switch; the lights go off.
text: Maurice re-forms into his bipedal self. He pockets his
text: slingshot, spies the watch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Hey--I did not return it in that
dialog: condition. What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Ronnie Coleman broke it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Tsk. What kind of person has no
dialog: respect for other people's
dialog: property?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You stole it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: So call your lawyer. How'd it
dialog: happen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What's it to you? Ronnie smashed
dialog: it, and then I got in trouble.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I always get in trouble, and I
dialog: don't do anything!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: You get in trouble, and you don't
dialog: do anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: You let them get away with it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
text: Maurice pulls a pack of Lucky Strikes out of his pocket, shakes
text: one out, lights it one-handed from a matchbook.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Brian, you've come to the right
dialog: place. I can help you. I can get
dialog: you what you want.
dialog: 
text: He blows smoke across the match, extinguishing it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (a little greedy)
dialog: What? You mean--like wishes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Wishes are strictly bush-league
dialog: leprechaun, pal. I'm a monster.
dialog: Monsters don't do wishes.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What do...monsters do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (imparting a great
dialog: secret)
dialog: Revenge.
dialog: 
text: He waits, smiling smugly. Brian is less than enthused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Oh, come on--Revenge! You know,
dialog: get back, even-up, tit-for-tat,
dialog: retribution in the best Old
dialog: Testament sense! Vengeance.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Revenge!
dialog: 
text: Brian raises an eyebrow, one corner of his mouth twitching into
text: a grin. Maurice seizes on this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Okay. This Ronnie guy. Big kid,
text: slack jaw, hair like a whisk
dialog: broom?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (sullen agreement)
dialog: Serious chromosome damage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Right! I know him! He's in my
dialog: district. I can get him for you.
dialog: 
dialog: Brian is starting to get into this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah? How?
dialog: 
dialog: Maurice holds up one finger ('allow me to demonstrate'), and
text: slides beneath the bed with a flourish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Ronnie Coleman's under my bed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: No...but under your bed is the way
text: to under Ronnie Coleman's bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Aah--you won't do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Brian--you gotta learn to trust
dialog: people. Besides, it's not like
dialog: you could come with me...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brian's eyes light up. He looks toward the bed. The forbidden
text: beckons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: ...noooo, oh, no. Forget it.
dialog: Wrong. Totally unprecedented.
dialog: 
text: Brian is grinning, now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: I was joking. It was a joke.
dialog: You're not allowed down there.
dialog: You could get hurt.
dialog: (beat; sinister)
dialog: I could strand you.
dialog: 
text: Brian frowns, then leans toward Maurice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You won't do that, 'cause I'm
dialog: taking this.
dialog: 
text: He brandishes the flashlight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Whoa, there, Thunder--no lights.
dialog: Definitely not allowed.
dialog: 
text: Brian flicks on the light, angles it toward him menacingly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Hey. Bring that along, why
dialog: dontcha?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: You're sure now...
dialog: 
text: Brian hesitates, then grins tightly, every late-night Charles
text: Bronson film of the last five years replaying in his mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Let's nail that toad to the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Y'know...you're my kinda guy.
dialog: 
text: Maurice lifts the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: After you.
dialog: 
text: Brian kneels. Looks at Maurice, dubious. He extends his hand
text: into the darkness. It does not go through the solid floor.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Oh, yeah, that's right. We gotta
dialog: go together. Dull people can't do
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Using one hand to support the bed, Maurice grabs Brian's arm,
text: helps him in. Brian, tentative, expecting to contact floor, is
text: startled to find none. He loses his balance, plunges straight
text: through the shadow; from below comes a THUD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (calling to Brian)
dialog: Good.
dialog: (a sinister smile)
dialog: Real good.
dialog: 
text: He disappears into the shadow. The bed THWOMPS to the floor.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - ATTIC STAIRS
dialog: 
text: Brian picks himself up off the ground. He is next to a closed
text: door, at the bottom of a narrow, steep staircase that leads up
text: to the rectangle shadow of the bed. Maurice skitters down the
dialog: staircase to him.
dialog: 
text: Brian panics, searches the floor beside him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Lose something?
dialog: 
text: Maurice dangles the flashlight from one finger. Brian grabs it.
text: Maurice pulls open the door, steps out into
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Brian peers down the hall--the ends, if any, are lost in the
text: distance. Doors are scattered along the walls; some reach high
text: with low-set knobs; others are short; there are Dutch doors and
text: French doors and doors that hang crooked, but still shut tight.
dialog: 
text: The walls loom, seemingly on the verge of collapsing in on
text: themselves. The dark mahogany wainscotting and dark red
text: wallpaper swallow the light from the tiny flickering gas lamps
text: near the ceiling.
dialog: 
text: Brian steps into this. His jaw is slack. A frayed red runner
text: cuts a swath down the polished black floor.
dialog: 
text: Maurice is already moving down the stairway. He realizes Brian
text: isn't with him, stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Yo! Brian! Let's move 'em out!
dialog: We're burning nightlight, pard!
dialog: 
text: Brian starts slowly, then hurries to catch up to Maurice.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - STAIRWELL
dialog: 
text: Brian gasps. The hallway has ended; they are at the bottom of
text: a huge well. Archways lead to other hallways; above, there are
text: tiers of landings running around the circumference, and more
text: hallways. Further up, the landings droop and twist, whole
text: sections torn away, until there is just black.
dialog: 
text: In the center of the well is a massive staircase, spiralling up,
text: offshoots connecting the landings. It continues far up, finally
text: standing alone, dilapidated, too impossibly high to support its
text: own weight--but it does. And there, at a dizzying height, it
text: ends at a small landing, at a pair of tall doors, seemingly
text: suspended in the darkness.
dialog: 
text: Brian grabs Maurice's robe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (a croak)
dialog: Where are we?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Hm? Oh...we go one flight up, and
text: it's the third door on the left.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: But--but Ronnie lives clear over

speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (a little smug)

scene_heading: INT. RONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: ...bitchin'...
dialog: 
text: Movement from above startles Brian; an ankle flops down, hangs
text: in front of his face. A beat, and he reaches for it--but
text: Maurice grabs his wrist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Wait--too primitive. Good
dialog: instinct, though. Hmm, now...what
dialog: deviltry to perpetrate tonight?
dialog: A banshee wail, perhaps?
dialog: (he runs a scale,
dialog: coughs)
dialog: ...mm, maybe not...lessee...We
dialog: gotta watch our step here. Every

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (thoughtful)
dialog: What time does he usually get up?
dialog: 
text: Maurice shoves his cap back, cocks an eyebrow...then grins.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RONNIE'S ROOM - LATER
dialog: 
text: Ronnie snurfles awake. Groggily, he stretches and sits up--
dialog: 
text: --and the sheet yanks tight, slamming Ronnie back onto the
text: mattress, pinning his arms. He struggles mightily, trying to
text: get up--the sheet snaps taut and he is pinned again.
dialog: 
text: Maurice and Brian grin like madmen at each other across the
text: bedshadow as they strain to keep Ronnie pinned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Mom! Dad! Help!
dialog: 
text: Brian almost lets go of his side--but Maurice puts a hand out in
dialog: a 'not yet' gesture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (his most horrible

speaker_heading: RONNIE

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (screechy old-type
dialog: voice)
dialog: If he gets up, I get his toes.
dialog: You can eat the rest.
dialog: 
text: Maurice looks at Brian: 'That's disgusting.' Brian shrugs; it
dialog: was just a first attempt.
dialog: 
text: Above, Ronnie gives up the struggle; he grimaces in humiliation.
text: A tear squeezes out of one eye, rolls down his cheek--
dialog: 
text: --the door opens; the light goes on. Ronnie's dad, a solid man
text: with an iron-grey brush cut, steps into the empty room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. COLEMAN

speaker_heading: RONNIE
speaker_heading: SHUT UP!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Ask him about the rubber sheets.
dialog: 
text: The kids sense the kill. Faces beam with grim pleasure,

scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - MAIN CHAMBER
dialog: 
text: Brian rushes out ahead of Maurice--

dialog: 
text: They pass a monster, MARY JANE; Brian swivels his head, staring

text: and holds up a string of very elegant paper dolls.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - STOREROOM
dialog: 
text: High wooden shelves line narrow aisles. There is one whole
text: shelf of stuffed animals lying on their backs wearing toe-tags,
text: a purloined plush-toy morgue.
dialog: 
text: Maurice moves along expertly, putting things into a canvas bag:
text: a roller skate, a stale taco guacamoled to a paper plate, a
text: Tupperware container of mud.
dialog: 
text: Brian steps into the room tentatively, intrigued by the contents
text: of the various bins. He peers into one, blinks. He reaches in,
text: pulls out a dead goldfish, holds it gingerly between his
text: fingers. He looks to Maurice for an explanation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Dead goldfish. Take the live ones
dialog: out of the tank, float these
dialog: suckers in belly-up, and there's
dialog: one kid who feels really bad and
dialog: gets a lecture on pet
dialog: responsibility to boot. Nice
dialog: little double-whammy item.
dialog: 
text: Brian tosses the fish back into the bin. A large chest is on
text: the floor. He opens it. It is filled with ballpoint pens,
text: keys, sunglasses, claim stubs, earrings (singles), lighters.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brian paws through it, puzzled--then the light dawns, and he

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (giving Brian the
dialog: glasses)
dialog: Here. At least pretend you're
dialog: cool.
dialog: 
text: Brian puts them on. He peers around the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It's kind of dark...
dialog: 
text: He takes a few steps--and bumps into the wall. He takes the
text: glasses off sheepishly, stows them in his shirt pocket, and
text: something else catches his eye: a stack of dirty magazines.
text: Brian takes the top one off the stack, pages through it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Wow...you get to look at all
dialog: these?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Yeah. No big deal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I found a copy of Playboy when I
dialog: was trash-digging once--it was
dialog: great. Boy, my mom--
dialog: 
text: An idea hits him. He closes the magazine, rolls it up and

speaker_heading: BRIAN

scene_heading: INT. TODD'S ROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE #1 - SERVICE PORCH - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE #2 - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

text: Methodically, Brian switches records into the wrong sleeves--

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Ta-da! The good scissors! First
dialog: we make 'em dull...
dialog: (cuts at a table leg)
dialog: Then, we hide the evidence.
dialog: (hides them under a

dialog: Not bad, huh? Perfected this

scene_heading: INT. DONLEAVY TWIN'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Here. Hold this.
dialog: 
text: He puts Kyle into Brian's arms, lifts Nathan out and puts him

text: Maurice takes Kyle and sets him into Nathan's bed.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE #3 - TOP OF STAIRS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Maurice carefully positions the roller skate on a step, angling

dialog: 
text: POV - MAURICE, along the skate, through the toe strap. It
text: centers on a barrel cactus in a tub...then moves across to a
text: china cabinet. It wavers back toward the cactus--then
text: decisively fixes on the china cabinet. Target sighted.
dialog: 
text: Maurice smiles. Brian comes out of the bathroom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (sinisterly pleased)

scene_heading: INT. ALAINE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (through cookie)
dialog: ...want some milk?
dialog: 
text: --and he opens the refrigerator door. Light spills out and

dialog: 
text: On the floor is the pile of clothes, a cake slice on top.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: ...sorry.
dialog: 
text: Brian reaches in and unscrews the fridge light bulb. Maurice is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (a bit miffed)
dialog: Next time wait for me to unplug
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: He grabs the jug of milk and takes a swig, then passes it to

text: emptying the milk jug. He starts throw it away--but Maurice
text: takes it, recaps it...and puts it back into the refrigerator.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE

dialog: 
text: Maurice tosses the remote-control onto a heaping pile of remote-

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah.

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - MAIN STAIRWELL
dialog: 
dialog: currently in-use as the playing field for a game of indoor
dialog: Monster Baseball. There are monster 'fielders': Mary Jane

text: All over the playing field are various breakable objects--

dialog: 
text: Maurice swings two bats--smashing a lamp behind him in the

dialog: 
text: Striding toward Brian is SPIKE, a stocky monster in a black

speaker_heading: SPIKE

speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: All right. Imaginary runners on

dialog: 
text: Spike passes the mound, tosses the ball to the pitcher, a
text: monster wearing OVERALLS, who winds up. Spike, still on his way
text: to the plate, drops to the ground--the ball whizzes past where
text: his head was. Maurice line-drives it into a stack stereo

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIKE

text: A shape looms; a huge hand grabs Brian by the head, and lifts
text: him out over the banister, the endless drop below him.
dialog: 
text: Brian grabs the thick wrist with both hands. His feet scramble
dialog: for purchase but find none.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE (O.S.)
dialog: He's with me, Snik!
dialog: 
text: And Maurice is there, defiant and wary. SNIK, one menacing
text: yellow eye much larger than the other, light glinting crazily
text: off them both, glares down at the smaller monster.
dialog: 
dialog: Snik holds Brian without strain--or a whole lot of concern for
text: Brian's life. He has the teeth of a shark; he is hunched over
text: from the weight of his muscled back and shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: He's the new guy.
dialog: 
text: Snik looks at Brian. His brow furrows. He looks at Maurice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNIK
dialog: (indicates the stairs)
dialog: Rules broken.
dialog: (indicates Brian)
dialog: Neck broken.
dialog: 
text: Maurice hops onto the banister, keeps his voice low so Brian
text: (trying to swing a leg over Snik's arm) won't hear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Headless people have limited
dialog: potential, Snik. He's with me.
dialog: (Snik no comprende)
dialog: The boss okayed it. Remember?
dialog: Bri-an Ste-ven-son?
dialog: 
text: Snik's eyes widen a little; his gaze flickers towards the upper
text: doors. Understanding floods his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNIK
dialog: Ah...this is the one?
dialog: 
text: Maurice gives Snik a dirty look, snaps a finger to his lips.
text: Snik lifts Brian back over the banister--but doesn't set him
text: down. Snik's thumb and forefinger cover Brian's ears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNIK
dialog: Too much for you, Maurice? Need
dialog: some help, I think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: No, Snik. I'll take care of him.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNIK
dialog: You'd better.
dialog: 
text: Snik drops Brian to the floor. Maurice helps him to his feet,
text: then practically pushes him down the stairs. Snik clears his
text: throat for attention. Maurice and Brian give it to him.
dialog: 
text: Snik holds up the flashlight. He unscrews the end, drops the
text: batteries into his hand. He grins, not straining as he crushes
text: the batteries, the acid dripping down his arm. He throws the
text: flashlight and endcap at Brian, who picks them up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNIK
dialog: Don't bring it again. Brian.
dialog: (displays the batteries)
dialog: Or head be next--Brian.
dialog: 
text: Maurice shoves Brian around, downstairs, watching Snik. Snik is
text: pleased with himself.

scene_heading: ANGLE - UPPERMOST DOORS,

text: backlit by flickering light, hunches within, watching.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - MAIN STAIRCASE
dialog: 
text: Maurice trundles Brian back toward the archway. Brian jerks out
text: of his grasp. He is a little angry, mostly terrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Who was that guy? He was going to
dialog: kill me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (shaking out a
dialog: cigarette, finding
dialog: matches)
dialog: Who? Snik? Naaww! He's all talk--
dialog: and big hands. He's just grumpy--
dialog: and dopey... and Sneezy, too, when
dialog: the pollen count is high.
dialog: Actually...he just got up on the
text: wrong side of the bed.
dialog: (lights cigarette,
dialog: looking toward the bed-
dialog: shadows)
dialog: 'Course, down here, we all do.
dialog: 
text: Brian gives a small, pained smile. Maurice seizes on this: With
text: a hearty laugh, he claps Brian on the back-- throws a quick,
text: worried/relieved and unseen-by-Brian look back up the stairs--
text: and guides Brian away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE - UPPERMOST DOORS
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: --and as the BOOM trails away, Eric's eyes open. He looks to

text: branches rattle against the pane.
dialog: 
text: Eric's eyes take in the room warily.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Eric slowly emerges from the stairwell, pauses at the top.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: ...Brian..?
dialog: 
text: No answer. He takes a few tentative steps into the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: ...Brian? Can I have the
dialog: flashlight?
dialog: 
text: He moves to the bed, reaches a hand toward the lump under the
text: covers. He jabs the covers. He shakes the covers. He pulls
text: them, revealing Brian's pillows, shaped into a sleeping form.
dialog: 
text: Eric looks very worried.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - LUNCH TABLES - DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Kiersten! I gotta have the
dialog: answers to the homework.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: No way, Jose.
dialog: 
text: She gives the sunglasses a perplexed, unimpressed look. Brian
text: pulls them off. He squints at the sunlight.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Mr. Finn said if I get another

speaker_heading: ALAINE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Oh, like Mr. Finn'll believe you
text: over Kiersten.
dialog: 
text: Brian looks at the two of them. He puts on the shades.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Forget it.
dialog: 
text: He walks back into the shadows. Kiersten catches up to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: Brian--are you feeling okay? You
dialog: look like you need some sleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Don't need sleep. I need answers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It was your idea to run a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: How else do we find out what he's
dialog: up to?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Well, we could ask him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (not hearing him)
dialog: Maybe he's sleeping off a bad

dialog: Drunks do that.
dialog: 
text: Eric starts around the house to the back door. Todd follows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: He's not a drunk. He's been at

speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Haven't you seen the commercials?

speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What?

speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (he checks for

dialog: Drugs.

speaker_heading: ERIC

scene_heading: INT. STEVENSON HOME - ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brian works alone at his desk. He twists on the gold back of

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brian shuts off the overhead light. He shuts off the light on

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIERSTEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kiersten looks angelic as she sleeps. Brian and Maurice slip
text: out from under the bed like mechanics on crawlers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Hey! That's Kiersten--
dialog: 
text: From outside comes the sudden sound of a small dog YAPPING. The
text: two jump. They relax when nothing else happens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: I don't think everyone heard--why
dialog: don't you just call 911?
dialog:

dialog: Hey!
dialog: (Brian tears his eyes

dialog: So what's she like?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (offhandedly)
dialog: She's a girl. She's real smart.
dialog: She always knows the answer,
dialog: always raises her hand--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: --always has her homework done?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah...always. Thinks she's so
dialog: much smarter than everybody else.
dialog: 
text: Maurice grins, rummages through the desk top. He finds a
dialog: peechee, finished homework inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Check out this action.
dialog: 
text: Maurice pulls at his jaws with both hands, hard, straining-- and
text: his face elongates. Brian stares, shocked. Gradually,
text: painfully, he molds the lower half of his face into the muzzle
dialog: of a dog.
dialog: 
text: Growling and yapping, Maurice chews up the homework. He finds
text: Kiersten's Polaroid flip-book, flips through it, dunks it into
text: a fish tank on her bookshelf. Maurice grins, then notices the
text: plywood box in one corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: What the hell is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Her science project.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
text: Maurice swings open the door, draws back the curtain-- light
text: pours out--he leaps away with a shriek, dropping the curtain.
dialog: 
text: Maurice looks down at his hand. It is shadow-like, slowly
text: reverting to normal. Brian has seen all of this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Are you okay?
dialog: 
text: Maurice, royally pissed off, strides to the box, fumbles around
text: behind it, yanks out the plug. He leans into the box.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brian looks away from him, back at Kiersten. A beat, and an off-
text: screen maleficent chuckle from Maurice, and then Maurice is back
text: at Brian's side. He grabs his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: C'mon, c'mon, let's go, we've all
dialog: seen a girl before. Let's move
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What'd you do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: You'll find out, you'll love it,

scene_heading: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Brian breezes through the door...then slows. At one of the lab
text: tables are MR. FINN, Kiersten, several other students.
dialog: 
text: Brian looks closer. On the table is Kiersten's plant-box and
text: the night-blooming cereus--now planted upside down, the roots
text: sticking out. Kiersten holds the flip-book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: But I have this--you can see how
dialog: it used to look--
dialog: 
text: She tries to riffle it, but it is now a solid brick. It flips
text: out of her hand. Kids giggle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. FINN
dialog: Do you at least have your report?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: (very sad)
dialog: ...no.

speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: The monster from under the bed!
text: It's dragging Brian away at night.
dialog: Look.
dialog: 
text: Eric inspects Todd's discovery. It is a fourteen inch-long dust-
dialog: ball smear that could be anything from a fish to--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: It's a footprINT. It stepped in
dialog: all that dust under there and left
dialog: a track.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm figuring out how big it is.
dialog: By measuring the length of the
dialog: footprint and the impression
dialog: depth, then using the...

dialog: ...'cube square' law--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: How big is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: ...and it fits under the bed?

scene_heading: INT. STEVENSON HOME - DINING ROOM - EVENING

speaker_heading: HOLLY

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

dialog: 
text: Brian examines his hand wonderingly. He regards the shadow,
text: then again extends his hand toward it. The hand passes through,
text: and Brian keeps putting his arm in, up to the elbow. Suddenly,
text: his arm is jerked and his face hits the mattress.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brian puts his watch-care paraphernalia into his bookbag,
text: including the watchstand. He crouches by the bed, puts one hand
text: into the shadow--still amazed he can do it.
dialog: 
text: He takes a last look around--and the mask cracks. For a moment,
text: he looks as if he is going to cry. The look becomes one of

dialog: 
text: Seven monsters play what looks like a street craps game.
text: Cigarette smoke fills the air; Maurice kneels for his turn;
text: monsters chatter for or against him, depending on their bets.
dialog: 
text: Maurice fires into the chalk circle, nailing the aimed-at cat's
text: eye. The monsters groan and cheer; money changes hands. Brian

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You got me!
dialog: 
text: Maurice leaps up and lets out a WHOOP--
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Maurice and Brian make slow progress as a drunken two person
text: conga line. Maurice wears a beerhelmet, sucking from the

dialog: 
text: Brian carries a teddybear and a plastic bag filled with water
text: and two live goldfish. In the other hand he carries a beer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE

scene_heading: INT. RONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Wow!
dialog: 
text: Ronnie, crouched on his bed, takes another cut at Maurice--

speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Ronnie crouches on the bed, tense, a baseball bat held at ready

dialog: From far away, is that the sound of laughter?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Brian and Maurice, still chuckling, use each other for support

dialog: 
text: A baby in Dr. Dentons sleeps. Six monsters stand around the

dialog: 
text: Maurice rises up from beneath the crib. Brian appears over

text: gestures magnanimously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: After you, Brian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Uh...it's just a baby.
dialog: 
text: Maurice looks uncomfortably at the other monsters, who exchange
text: looks. A murmur of 'who's the wimp?' is heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Yeah. So? Look, Bri--we can't
dialog: have this new generation growing
dialog: up not believing in monsters.
dialog: Fear is an important character

speaker_heading: MAURICE

dialog: G'head, Bri--just give it a good

dialog: 
text: He glowers at Brian, then gestures sharply, prompting him.
text: Brian leans forward hesitantly. The monsters lean forward,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Boo. Boo.
dialog: 
dialog: The monsters are disappointed. Some 'tsk.'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: What are you--the toothfairy?
dialog: Like this.
dialog: 
text: Maurice makes a horrible face, climbs halfway into the crib,
text: waking the baby with really gross slurping sounds.
dialog: 
text: The baby's eyes go wide; he cries. The other monsters join in.
text: The kid really bawls. Brian doesn't like it.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Stop it!

dialog: 
text: The monsters stare at him, their disgust and anger becoming

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Brian--
dialog: 
text: --and yanks it open. LIGHT spills into the room from the
dialog: hallway-- the monsters transform--
dialog: 
text: And so does Brian's arm--it transforms into a sleeve.
dialog: 
text: Brian stares in horror at his arm. He hurls himself at the hall

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NEAR DAWN
dialog: 
text: Brian rushes out the door of the house, to the sidewalk-- then
text: slows. Stops. He has no idea where he is. He looks around,

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NEAR STEVENSON HOME - DAWN
dialog: 
text: The sun breaks the horizon. Brian, terrified, looks at his arms--
text: but they do not change. He lets out a deep breath. He squints

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STEVENSON HOME - ERIC'S ROOM - DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (excited; low)
dialog: I figured it out. I know what the
dialog: monster is doing with Brian.
dialog: 
text: Eric gives no response; Todd plows on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: It's a body snatcher. See, it's
dialog: taking over Brian and using his
dialog: body to prepare the way for the
dialog: invasion force!

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Tomorrow, okay?
dialog: 
text: Eric turns his head away. Todd looks at him, crestfallen. He

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brian sits on his bed, light switch in hand. He checks over the
text: side of the bed; nothing. He pulls his knees up, waits.
dialog: 
text: Wraith-like, Maurice slips into the room. He stands with his
text: fists on his hips, staring at Brian--who starts, looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm not going. I don't want to
dialog: live down there. I don't want to

dialog: ahead, say it. You don't want to
dialog: be like me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I am not going.
dialog: (he looks away)
dialog: You didn't want me to be your
dialog: friend. You just wanted me to
dialog: turn into a monster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (not liking the
dialog: accusation, 'cause it's
dialog: pretty accurate)
dialog: Can't make somebody do something
dialog: they really don't wanna do. Now,
dialog: c'mon--
dialog: 
text: Maurice grabs Brian by the arm; Brian pulls away. He grabs the
text: light switch. Maurice leaps for his arm--Brian snaps on the
text: lights, and Maurice transforms into clothes.
dialog: 
text: Brian catches his breath. He reaches into the clothes, ignoring
text: the slapping sleeves. Brian's hand emerges from the pocket of
text: the robe with Maurice's matches. The sleeves freeze, drop.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brian tears a match from the packet. He holds it to the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Leave me alone. Don't come back
dialog: here. Do you understand?
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Do you understand?
dialog: 
text: Silence. Brian strikes the match. The clothes shrink back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Don't make me do this. Just
dialog: promise to leave me alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (a long pause) (muffled)
dialog: I promise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: ...okay.
dialog: 
text: He shuts off the lights. The match illumines his face; Maurice
text: re-forms, and moves toward Brian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (with a sneer)
dialog: You trusted me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Maurice, about to mock him, pulls up short.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (shakes his head sadly)
dialog: It's not that easy.
dialog: 
text: Ducking his head, he dives past Brian into the under-the-bed.
text: The match burns down; Brian drops it; the room goes black.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A hand covers Eric's mouth gently. He snaps awake, cries out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (removing his hand)
dialog: Shh--quiet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Geez--I thought you were the
dialog: monster.
dialog: 
text: Brian swallows this without comment. He holds the flashlight.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Here, take this. If you hear
dialog: anything, turn it on-- and yell--
dialog: even if it's only a pile of
dialog: clothes. Especially if it's a
dialog: pile of clothes. Okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: No. I'm not going to. You're

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No--I'm not--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I promised to be good. I'm not
dialog: going to have any more nightmares.
dialog: 
text: Eric won't take the flashlight. Brian sets it on the bed. He
text: pauses in the doorway, turns on the lights, and then he goes.
dialog: 
text: Eric gets out of bed, and shuts off the lights. He climbs back
text: under the covers. He picks up the flashlight. He clicks it on,
text: off, on again. Dead batteries. No light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Thanks a lot, Brian.
dialog: 
text: He drops the flashlight beside the bed, rolls over angrily.

scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNIK
dialog: You did bad, Maurice. Bad for

dialog: will, too.

speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: I told the Boss how to get him--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNIK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
dialog: Your brother's gone. I went to
dialog: check on him--Do you have any idea
dialog: where he is?
dialog: 
text: Brian shakes his head slowly. She looks down, worried,
text: thinking. She stands up suddenly, heads out of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLY
text: Todd's house. Maybe he's there.
dialog: (halts at the stairs)
dialog: My God--Glen. You don't think
dialog: he'd try to go there, do you?
dialog: 
text: Brian shakes his head again. Holly hurries down the stairs,
text: leaving Brian alone in the room. He leaps from the bed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ERIC'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brian surveys the room. The dresser has been pulled away from
text: the wall, two of its drawers almost all the way out. The
text: mattress is askew on the box spring, the sheets strewn on the
text: floor. The overall effect is one of fast packing--or a fight.
dialog: 
text: Brian picks up the blanket--it is ripped in several places.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Maurice.
dialog: 
text: Something catches his eye. He kneels--
dialog: 
text: ANGLE - BENEATH THE BED, where the crushed flashlight lies on
text: the edge of the shadow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Snik.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STEVENSON HOME - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brian drops from the tree near his window, bookpack on one
text: shoulder. He races down the sideyard, disappears.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TODD'S HOUSE - REAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: Brian, as he crouches beneath a window. He reaches
text: up, taps on the glass, waits. Nothing. He taps again, harder.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD (O.S.)
dialog: (muffled)

speaker_heading: TODD (O.S)
dialog: If my mom catches me sneaking out--
speaker_heading: HEY!

speaker_heading: TODD

speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: believe everything!
dialog: 
text: Brian is exasperated. Reluctantly, he tries one last gambit:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I know why you're in trouble.
dialog: Your mom found a Playboy in your
dialog: underwear drawer. The Christmas
dialog: issue--there was a girl on the
text: cover painted like a candy cane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: How'd you know that?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yes!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: At least I didn't lie to my mom.
dialog: I told her I got the magazine from
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: Brian smiles, a sad smile. He holds the bookpack out to Todd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Here. You're going to need these.
dialog: 
text: Todd takes the bookpack warily. He looks inside. He near-
text: reverently takes out a pair of old sneakers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: They're an old pair of mine. They
dialog: should fit okay.

speaker_heading: TODD

scene_heading: INT. KIERSTEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The blankets are tented, lit from inside. A pebble ricochets
text: off the window. Kiersten pops out of the blankets, startled,

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. KIERSTEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

text: onto the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: It's crucial. The monsters from

text: over, angry and exasperated, at Todd.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIERSTEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kiersten goes back to her bed. A pebble hits the glass. She
text: ignores it. Another hits. A beat. Pebbles hit the glass in a
text: staccato series. Kiersten jumps to the window, raises it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: Go away!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. KIERSTEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brian tosses away the pebble in his hand, drops the huge

text: far off to one side, on the rucksack, dejected.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Todd told you the truth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: You expect me to believe that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I believed it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: That I believe.
dialog: 
text: She moves to close the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Wait! What if I prove it's true?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: Monsters under the bed? Fat
dialog: chance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: If I prove it--then will you help?
dialog: 
text: Kiersten wavers, considering. That is all Brian needs.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'll prove it.

dialog: We'll have to split up. You know
dialog: what to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: No problem.
dialog: 
text: Brian nods, spins, races from the yard. Todd lifts the

text: overbalances him, pulling him over.
dialog: 
text: Kiersten shakes her head, slides the window shut.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Todd, the rucksack heavy on his back, peers out from behind a

speaker_heading: BRIAN (O.S.)
dialog: (a cautious whisper)
dialog: Kiersten!
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Brian scrambles out, bookpack over his shoulder.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well? Do you believe me?

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - FENCE - NIGHT
dialog:

text: A pause, then Kiersten gives a single quick bird-like nod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Good. Okay--what I need is that
dialog: light you were using for your
dialog: science project.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: The fifty-six hundred K?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: Fifty-six hundred K. It's the
dialog: same color temperature as sunlight--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yes. Perfect.
dialog: (he checks his
dialog: pocketwatch)
dialog: So can I have the key? Sunrise is
dialog: at six. I gotta get going.
dialog: 
text: Kiersten picks up her bookpack, dumps the contents out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: I'm going with you.
dialog: (Brian is shocked)
dialog: Give me some of those flashlights.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No! Forget it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: (holding up the
dialog: penlight)
dialog: You're not going to make me go
dialog: down there with just this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: But--It's dangerous down there!
dialog: There are monsters down there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: ...and you're going to take them
dialog: all on by yourself? Get real,
dialog: Brian.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: You'll really help me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: I believe you.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Solemnly, Brian trades the 4-cell for the penlight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: Now, turn around so I can get
dialog: dressed.
dialog: 
text: Brian blinks, then turns. CLOSE ON his face as he listens,
text: nervous and curious, to the rustling O.S.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - FENCE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The rucksack is hung up at the top of the fence. Todd, on the
text: other side, his feet braced on the chainlink, hangs on the
text: strap, straining to pull the rucksack over. It goes suddenly,
text: and Todd and the rucksack hit the ground--again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KIERSTEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Brian checks his pocketwatch. The Man-in-the-Moon glares out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Todd should be ready. Let's go.
dialog: 
text: He hands Kiersten her bookpack, shoulders into his own with an
text: audible grunt of effort. He climbs into the shadow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: This is where I start getting...
dialog: (she shudders)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Look--you don't have to go. It's
dialog: okay. Just give me the key.
dialog: 
text: Kiersten examines this escape clause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: No...I promised.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Besides--I gotta make sure you
dialog: don't steal answers.
dialog: 
text: Her shaky smile lets Brian in on the joke. He smiles back
text: reassuringly, reaches a hand out to her. She crawls into the
text: under-the-bed, halts when both arms go through the shadow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: Omigod...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It's okay...be careful here...
dialog: 
text: They disappear into the under-the-bed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - KIERSTEN'S STAIRWAY
dialog: 
text: --more alien and sinister than ever. But free of monsters.
text: Kiersten steps cautiously down the stairs, followed by Brian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: (in awe)
dialog: Like down the rabbit hole...
dialog: 
text: They reach level ground. Kiersten examines her surroundings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: These stairs all go to different
dialog: rooms? So we grab Eric and get
dialog: out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's the plan.
dialog: 
dialog: But his expression says it may be more difficult than that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Todd moves past the classroom windows in a stoop, rucksack on
text: his back. He straightens, dumps the rucksack to the ground.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Mary Jane goes by, dragging a mud-filled Barbie Dream House. A
text: beat; Brian emerges from a hiding place. He checks; the coast
text: is clear. He signals; Kiersten emerges wide-eyed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Todd wrestles with two hinged wooden poles from the rucksack.
dialog: They should fit together, but he can't quite get it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Brian, Kiersten following, stops along a series of doorways.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Todd pushes a wooden rod into a tight canvas sleeve. Suddenly
text: it goes, and the rod shoots all the way through the sleeve.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Brian and Kiersten wait, alert, jumpy. All is quiet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: C'mon, Todd.
dialog: 
text: Behind Brian, one part of the hallway starts to change. Brian
text: turns as the wall twists in on itself...creaking and groaning,
text: it flattens into a stairway rising up. With a SNAP a door
text: springs into place in front of the stairwell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah! It worked!
dialog: 
text: Brian pulls open the door, escorts Kiersten through.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT - CLOSE ON
dialog: 
text: Brian and Kiersten as they crawl out from the shadow under--
dialog: 
text: --an old army cot, Todd lying on top of it. It looks extremely
text: out of place in the empty schoolyard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Good job, Todd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: It actually worked?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: I think I am definitely going to
dialog: go crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (leading her to the
dialog: door)
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Hey! What's she doing here? She
dialog: got to go? You wouldn't let me!
dialog: (he catches up to
dialog: Kiersten)
dialog: What's it like down there? Is it
dialog: neat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN

scene_heading: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - SUPPLY ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: as flashlight beams hit a cabinet. Kiersten unlocks it, opens
text: it. She finds the 5600K bulb, gives it to Brian.
dialog: 
text: Brian opens his bookpack, pulls out a mechanic's clamp light
text: with cigarette-lighter attachment and a motorcycle battery. As
text: Todd and Kiersten look on, Brian assembles his Sun-Gun:
dialog: 
text: With wire cutters, he strips the plug off the floodlight. He
text: attaches the wires to the battery, tightens the wing-nuts. He
text: screws the 5600-K bulb in. He flips it on.
dialog: 
text: BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT floods the room. Brian staggers-- flips
text: the light off quickly. A cold sweat stands on his forehead-- he
text: looks ill, but shakes it off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (blinking, eyes re-
dialog: adjusting)
dialog: Oh, man--that'll get 'em. That's
text: like a howitzer or something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: You must know a lot about
dialog: electricity to do that...
dialog: (Brian grins)
dialog: ...how come you get 'F's in
dialog: science?
dialog: (Brian's grin fades)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Hey, guys, what about this?
dialog: 
text: From deep in the now-empty rucksack, Todd extracts a battered
text: plastic miner's helmet with revolving bubble light on top, puts
text: it on proudly. Kiersten smiles at him; Brian does not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What are you gonna do with that?
dialog: 
text: Todd stops grinning. He's not fucking around here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: I'm going. Eric's my best friend.
dialog: 
text: Brian tries to stare him down, but the kid's not giving in.
dialog: Brian starts to say something--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD (O.S.)
dialog: What're you kids doing here?
dialog: 
text: He stands in the hallway doorway. Brian moves first, grabbing
text: the other two. They race out the exterior door, slam it shut.

dialog: 
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The trio beeline for the cot. Brian scrambles under, then
text: Kiersten. Todd hesitates--Brian grabs his arm--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You wanna go--then c'mon!
dialog: 
text: --and yanks him down. The classroom door bangs open, and the
text: guard hurries out, flashlight on. He sweeps the yard, spots the
text: cot. He approaches it warily. He grabs a corner and yanks it
text: off the ground. The kids--and the cot's shadow--are gone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: The three drop from the shadow as it violently disappears. Only
text: Brian lands smoothly. Brian helps Kiersten up. Todd is awed,
text: body slack. He smiles, spins excitedly to the others.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (too loud)
dialog: It's a parallel dimension!
dialog: 
text: Brian shushes him. Kiersten hisses 'Quiet!' Todd gulps
text: abashedly, then looks around some more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (a knowing whisper)
dialog: It's a parallel dimension.
dialog: 
dialog: Brian gestures 'quiet,' then 'follow me.'
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: They walk three abreast; with each step, they become more
text: scared. Todd starts to whistle; random scratchy notes, slowly
text: becoming recognizable: the theme from 'Bridge Over the River
text: Kwai.' Brian joins in, then Kiersten. Brian sings softly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Comet--It makes your teeth turn
dialog: green...
dialog: (Todd joins in)
dialog: Comet--It's worse than
dialog: Listerine...
dialog: 
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - MAURICE,
dialog: 
text: sitting on a stairway, back against the railing. His eye is
text: puffy, his robe torn--he's been beat up. Junk food packages
text: surround him: a Chips Ahoy bag rests on his bloated stomach.
dialog: 
text: Maurice cocks an ear, hearing the group, then turns to watch

speaker_heading: BRIAN/TODD/KIERSTEN

dialog: some Comet--and vomit--today!
dialog: 
text: The group laughs as they disappear around a corner. Maurice
text: smiles, too--then his face falls. A beat. He rises suddenly,
text: tossing away the cookie bag, and starts up the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: The trio move quickly. A monster crosses their path-- Kiersten
text: and Todd are scared; Brian snaps on his flashlight-- the monster
text: transforms into clothes. Todd and Kiersten stare.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: It's like chameleons-- protective
dialog: camouflage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah--hand me another flashlight,
dialog: huh?
dialog: 
text: Brian pins the transformed monster in the beam of the second
text: flashlight, sets it on the floor. The monster is pinned.
dialog: 
text: Todd stares at the clothes. He reaches up to turn on his
text: helmet. It doesn't go on. A tad panicked, he slaps the side of
text: the helmet. The bubble light and the miner's lamp go on--
dialog: 
text: --and Brian is caught in the beam. Something catches Kiersten's
text: eye--she leans closer to Brian, staring at his arm. The skin
text: looks like cloth. She shines her own flashlight on it--the
text: transformation quickens. Brian yanks his arm out of the lights.
text: Kiersten fixes him with a stare.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: You're one of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No...I was supposed to be...but
dialog: I'm not.
dialog: 
text: He steps toward her. She gestures threateningly with her
text: flashlight. Todd is still staring, frozen in place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Kiersten...please--we gotta save
dialog: Eric.
dialog: 
text: She looks into his eyes. She decides. She turns off the light.
text: Todd still stares. She nudges Todd; he starts, then turns off
text: the helmet. The three stand there for a moment--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: Well? Let's go save Eric.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE MAIN STAIRWAY,
dialog: 
text: more imposing and sinister than ever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (a squeak)
dialog: Up there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's where the Boss is-- that's
dialog: where Eric is. We'll take side
dialog: stairs and stuff as far as we can.
dialog: 
text: He points toward a hallway, starts for it--
dialog: 
text: --and Billy rounds a corner, pushing a wheelbarrow full of
text: buttons. He stops when he sees them; they stare back. Billy
text: spins, lets go of the wheelbarrow--buttons scatter-- he runs--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (his yells echoing)
dialog: Red Alert! Everybody, lookout,
dialog: Red Alert--
dialog: 
text: --and suddenly a beam of light cuts across the hall. The Billy-
text: clothes continue their momentum, sailing through the air,
text: landing, rolling into a ball in the corner.
dialog: 
text: Kiersten holds the monster in the beam of her flashlight. Brian
dialog: pins it with another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Good shooting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Bogies at two o'clock!
dialog: 
text: Spike and Mary Jane race toward them, shouting--

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - LOWER LANDING
dialog: 
text: Our heroes race through an archway, and come to a dead halt--

text: main stairway hanging in space, tantalizingly close.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The threesome exchange glances--then turn: this is where they

text: the hall come the sounds of their pursuers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Kiersten...um...about your science
dialog: project--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: I figured it out. It's okay.
dialog: 
text: Brian, surprised, gives her a sideways look, smiles--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: There's one!
dialog: 
text: He snaps on his light--Brian grabs his wrist, knocking the
dialog: flashlight down.
dialog: 
dialog: It is Maurice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (gestures to an alcove)
dialog: Quick, in here!
dialog: 
text: Brian appraises him, surprised, suspicious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: C'mon! No time!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You're gonna trust him? He's a
dialog: monster!
dialog: 
text: Brian gazes at Maurice; Maurice, too, waits for the answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: He's my friend.
dialog: 
text: Maurice's face relaxes--the boy he once was can almost be seen.
text: Out of the dark comes the sound of approaching monsters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: So hide already!
dialog: 
text: The three duck into an alcove.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: HEY! DOWN HERE! HERE THEY ARE!
dialog: 
text: Kiersten frowns, looks at Brian. Brian keeps watching. The
text: monsters run up to Maurice--who starts running from them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: C'mon! This way! Let's get 'em!
dialog: 
text: Monsters race after him, shouting their bloodlust.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - RONNIE'S STAIRS

scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - MAIN STAIRCASE
dialog: 
text: near the top. Brian peeks out quickly over the top step.
dialog: 
text: In front of the tall doors are two SENTINEL MONSTERS.
dialog: 
text: Todd and Kiersten lean close. Brian rubs his jaw. Todd's
text: helmet bumps against Kiersten's head. She gives it a look--then
text: looks at it again. Smiles.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - UPPERMOST LANDING.
dialog: 
text: The sentinel monsters, bored at their posts. Unseen by them, a
text: hand sets Todd's helmet on the floor. Gives it a push. It
text: slides across the landing, to in front of the monsters. The
text: monsters look at it. Exchange a puzzled glance. One takes a
dialog: tentative step closer to the helmet--
dialog: 
text: --one of Todd's sneaker's, thrown hard, hits the side of the
text: helmet. The revolving light goes on; the monsters are caught,
text: changing back and forth between monster and clothes.
dialog: 
text: The trio spring onto the landing. Todd and Kiersten go about
text: pinning the monsters; Brian steps past them, eyes fixed on the
text: doors. Immensely tall and impossibly narrow, polished black
text: wood, covered with intricate runes. Nightmare doors.
dialog: 
text: Brian readies the Sun-Gun. Kiersten and Todd look on as Brian
text: forces himself to touch the knob. He turns it. He pushes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - MASTER BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: The doors part. Brian peers through. He steps in, Todd and
text: Kiersten close behind; they gape at the room--
dialog: 
text: Toys of all eras fill the room, on tall standing shelves. Train
text: tracks and race-car tracks criss-cross the floor. All is
text: covered with dust and cobwebs--an attic filled with forgotten,
text: worn-out treasures, now rotting, and hiding rats.
dialog: 
text: Hanging from the ceiling are model airplanes of all sizes and
dialog: types.
dialog: 
text: At the far end of the room is a fireplace, a chair to one side.
text: A silhouetted figure rises from the chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: Watch the stairs.
dialog: 
text: Brian steps forward, peering through shadow-mottled room at the
text: shape. He brings the light up, thumb on the ON switch.
dialog: 
text: Backlit by the flames, the figure seems bent over with age, a
text: twisted shape. Then it steps into the light--it is a young boy,
text: Brian's age, possibly younger. A boy who has stopped
dialog: growing...but hasn't stopped aging.
dialog: 
text: In one hand he holds a marionette, its strings hopelessly
text: tangled. He wears a Victorian nightshirt and velvet dressing
text: gown. When he speaks, it is the voice of a boy-- but with the
text: rhythms and control of an adult. He gazes directly at Brian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Brian. Such a pleasure to meet
dialog: you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I want my brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: And you brought friends. How
dialog: nice!
dialog: 
text: Brian brandishes the Sun-Gun, no fooling around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I want Eric.
dialog: 
text: A heavy arm shoves Brian to the ground--Brian hits hard, bounces
dialog: up, snapping on the Sun-Gun--
dialog: 
text: --Snik's foot slams down on the cord; it is torn away from the
text: battery in a shower of sparks. Snik reaches menacingly for
text: Brian, but a sharp gesture and a dark look from the boy cows
text: him. Kiersten has been searching her pack; she is out of
text: flashlights. She looks resignedly at Brian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Now, Brian--what sort of greeting
dialog: is that? After all, we are so
dialog: much alike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No, we're not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Yes, we are, Brian. You're like
dialog: all of us down here. You're
dialog: already one of us-- under the
dialog: skin.
dialog: 
text: He nonchalantly tries to untangle the marionette's strings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: When Maurice told me how you
dialog: scared Eric--'Monsters are like
dialog: moths.' Sheer genius. You belong
dialog: here. You know you do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I do not!
dialog: 
text: The boy's efforts at the strings get more frantic, less
dialog: effective.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Stay here with us, Brian. You
dialog: have friends here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Maurice only pretended to be my
dialog: friend-- to lure me down here--
dialog: (beat; grim)
dialog: Where's my brother?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the boy smashes the marionette onto a table top.
text: Splintered pieces scatter. The boy looks at the crushed puppet
text: briefly, then drops it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Snik. Show him Eric.
dialog: 
text: Grinning, Snik creaks open a toychest. He pulls Eric up by the
text: hair. He is a poor Jack-in-the-box, one eye blackened, mouth
dialog: bloody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Eric!
dialog: 
text: Eric's eyes track, finally focus in on Todd. Todd starts toward
text: him--but Snik pulls Eric out of the chest, a huge forearm across
text: Eric's throat. Kiersten grabs Todd's arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNIK
dialog: C'mon. This puny neck-- break
dialog: easy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: If you stay, you'll be the one in
dialog: charge of yourself. You'll be the
dialog: one with power. Not your parents.
dialog: Not your teachers. You.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Isn't that what you want?
dialog: 
text: Sounds from outside the doors; Kiersten looks that way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: Brian! More monsters--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: (looking out)
dialog: --lots more monsters.
dialog: 
text: Brian looks at Todd, Kiersten. They watch him, waiting for his
text: decision. Brian focuses on the boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I want Eric.
dialog: 
text: Dramatically, Brian pulls a flashlight out of his pocket,
text: brandishes it--looks down at it.
dialog: 
text: It is the penlight. Snik looks at the puny light, chuckles.
dialog: 
text: Brian grits his teeth, aims it at the boy, flips it on--
dialog: 
text: --the boy flinches away, blocking his face with his arms.
dialog: 
text: Brian whirls, closes on Snik, aims the light at Snik's head.
text: Snik's head--just his head--transforms into an army boot and a
text: pair of sweat socks. His arm is still at Eric's throat.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brian lowers the light--Snik bellows as his head re-forms and
text: his arm becomes a pant leg; Eric struggles out of Snik's grip;
text: Todd and Kiersten grab Eric and they scramble away.
dialog: 
text: Snik grabs Brian with his untransformed arm; Brian aims the
text: light below Snik's waist, turning the monster's legs into a
text: shirt and jacket. Snik bellows again as his still-formed torso
text: collapses on top of the clothes.
dialog: 
text: Brian heads for his friends by the door.
dialog: 
text: Snik recovers, struggles to his feet, ready to give chase. The
text: boy lays a restraining hand on his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Don't worry, Snik. They've lost.

scene_heading: EXT. UNDER-THE-BED - UPPERMOST LANDING
dialog: 
text: Brian, Kiersten, Todd and Eric look down. Monsters crowd up the
dialog: stairway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: We're cut off!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: We can make it!
dialog: 
text: Brian leads the others straight toward the oncoming monsters--
text: just before they meet, he turns down a side landing.
dialog: 
text: It dead-ends short of the uppermost level of the stairwell.
text: Brian leaps across; his friends follow. Monsters scatter,
text: taking alternate routes to get at them.
dialog: 
text: Brian opens a door at random, climbs a stairway to beneath a bed-
text: shadow. He is all set to move smoothly through the shadow--but
text: slams full-tilt into it, his head hitting hard.
dialog: 
text: Brian holds his skull, stares unbelievingly at the shadow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: What's wrong?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
text: Brian tries to push his hand through; it stops at the shadow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: (an idea hits her)
dialog: Ohmigod--What time is it?
dialog: 
text: Brian pulls out his pocketwatch. The watch reads 5:23; the
text: benign sun-face peeks out through the wedge, the malevolent man-
text: in-the moon almost gone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: We've still got almost half an
dialog: hour...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: (gestures to the watch)
dialog: Are you sure it's right?
dialog: 
text: Brian looks from the shadowway to the watch. His face falls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I didn't fix it. It's still
dialog: broken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You mean we're trapped?
dialog: 
text: A laugh sounds from below. The four look down at the Boss, who
text: grins triumphantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Brian. I'm so glad you decided to
dialog: stay.
dialog: 
text: Brian turns back to the shadow, pushes--then slams his fists at
text: the shadow, in frustration, in anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY (O.S.)
dialog: Truthfully, I'm surprised you even
dialog: came down. Imagine, a selfish
dialog: little bugger who cares for no one
dialog: trying to do a good deed--
text: (his taunts lash at
dialog: Brian)
dialog: Of course, it did only serve to
dialog: deliver your friends unto me. So
dialog: I guess that ultimately all this
dialog: misfortune is your fault. But,
dialog: then, you already knew that,
dialog: didn't you?
dialog: 
text: Brian can take no more. With a roar, he rushes down the stairs,
text: past the others, at the boy--who steps back. Brian sprawls.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Snik comes at Brian. Brian lashes out with his foot, nailing
text: Snik in the shin. Snik howls. Brian kicks viciously at Snik's
text: other leg. Snik howls again, and Brian scrambles to his feet.
text: He brings his leg up with all his might, as hard as he can--
dialog: 
text: --and Snik catches it inches from his crotch. He wags one
text: finger of his free hand at Brian. Brian' eyes widen in dread.
text: Snik tumbles him backwards to the floor.
dialog: 
text: Brian tries to struggle up--a huge fist smashes into the side of
text: his head, stunning him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - STAIRWELL
dialog: 
text: where the others watch the fight--Kiersten winces as another
text: haymaker pounds Brian--who stops moving. Snik stands over him,
text: bellows triumphantly. The boy looks up at them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Allie-Allie-otsen-free.
dialog: (beat; harsher)
dialog: We're waiting.
dialog: 
text: Kiersten, Todd and Eric exchange glances, all hope gone.
text: Kiersten drops her head--then starts down. Todd follows.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Monsters grab Kiersten, Todd and Eric. Spike strips off Brian's
text: pack--the movement causes Brian to revive. He groans, sitting
dialog: up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: You see, Brian? You cannot
dialog: challenge my power down here. If
dialog: I say you stay, then you stay. If
dialog: I say the shadows are closed, then
text: the shadows are closed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE (O.S.)
dialog: Aa, put a sock in it.
dialog: 
text: He steps out of the shadows. Looks at Brian. 'Tsk's once at
dialog: his condition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: There's still time to get out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
text: The shadow is closed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: To Brian it's closed. He came
dialog: down here to rescue his brother.
dialog: Not your typical monster behavior,
dialog: is it?
dialog: 
text: Kiersten's eyes widen. She struggles out of the grasp of the
text: monster holding her, grabs up the penlight off the floor. She
text: shines it--on Brian's arm.
dialog: 
text: Brian does not change. A monster wrestles the light from
text: Kiersten. Brian snaps his gaze to the Boss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You tricked me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: All part of the game, Brian. Oh,
dialog: don't look so surprised. Only
dialog: monsters can move in shadows. You
dialog: gave up any claim to that
dialog: privilege when you chose to rescue
dialog: your brother.
dialog: 
text: This surprises some of the monsters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPIKE
dialog: You told me once you start to
dialog: change, there's no going back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Did you really want to go back?
dialog: 
text: Spike looks down; maybe he did at one time, but not any more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (to Maurice)
dialog: As for you--I've put up with your
dialog: behavior long enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: I'm just a natural-born rebel.
dialog: Shoot me.
dialog: 
text: The boy stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Snik.
dialog: (indicating Brian)
dialog: Break his neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (steps toward Snik)
dialog: NO!
dialog: 
text: Snik drops Brian unceremoniously, and gestures to Maurice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNIK
dialog: More medicine, eh? Cure you--of
dialog: life.
dialog: 
text: Maurice hesitates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Your move, Maurice.
dialog: 
text: Maurice looks at the towering Snik--then spins, and runs.
dialog: 
text: Brian, from the floor, stares after Maurice, drops his head.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. ALAINE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
dialog:

text: he races across the room and jumps out the window, crashing
dialog: through the screen to--
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXT. ROOF
dialog: 
text: --where he leaps across to the next house--he dashes along the

scene_heading: INT. DEFENSIVE NINE-YEAR-OLD'S BEDROOM - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - HALLWAY

text: catching him by surprise. He slams him face forward into the
dialog: floor-- Maurice rolls clear--
dialog: 
text: Brian commando-rolls to his backpack, grabbing it from Spike,
text: and dives for the Sun-Gun on the floor--
dialog: 
text: --with his teeth, he strips one of the wires--
dialog: 
dialog: --Maurice helps Kiersten, Eric and Todd free themselves--
dialog: 
text: --Brian twists down the wing nuts on the battery--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Stop them!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Don't listen to him! What's he
dialog: ever done for you?
dialog: 
text: Monsters, starting forward, pause to think.
dialog: 
dialog: --Brian brings the lamp up--
dialog:

dialog: 
text: BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT cuts across the room, slams into the Boss,
text: slams him up into the lattice--he flattens into a silhouette--
text: the light slices through him--the lattice gives way--the Boss is
text: blasted up and away, into oblivion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: The bulb EXPLODES--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: P.O.V. BRIAN--
dialog: 
text: --as his eyes re-adjust to the darkness, revealing:
dialog: 
text: The hallway: Some of the monsters have been turned into
text: Hiroshima shadows on the walls. Some are partial shadows. Snik
text: is a mess: part monster, part clothes, part wavering between
text: solid and shadow.
dialog: 
text: Brian drops the lamp. He looks around wildly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Maurice? Maurice!
dialog: 
text: A doorway opens; Maurice peers out warily. He surveys the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (shaky)
dialog: Now, that's what I call rock 'n
dialog: roll.
dialog: 
text: Brian sighs. Maurice steps out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Shouldn't you folks be toddling
dialog: along?

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDER-THE-BED - ATTIC STAIRS
dialog: 
text: Eric and Todd are on the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: Well, we were right, huh?
dialog: 
text: Eric smiles, slaps him five, as Maurice, followed by Brian,
text: hurries past them to the top of the stairs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: (as Maurice goes by)
dialog: You might not be able to get
dialog: through now--now that you helped
dialog: us--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah--monsters don't help friends--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Maurice slides his hand through, with no problem. He looks at
text: it, half-through, and then looks down sadly at Brian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Face it, Bri--some of us got it,
dialog: some of us don't.
dialog: 
text: He grabs Kiersten's shoulder, hustles her out--then Eric, and
text: Todd. Maurice looks at Brian, who doesn't move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Get out of here, you toothfairy.
dialog: 
text: Brian gives him a long look, climbs through the hole.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STEVENSON HOME - ATTIC ROOM - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Brian slides out from under the bed. He glances at the window--
text: the sun is up, but it hasn't cleared the horizon yet. He turns
text: and looks at Maurice, still in the shadow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Well, I promised you excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Those other monsters are going to
dialog: kill you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Sunshine.
dialog: 
text: Brian spots the penlight, in Kiersten's hand. He takes it. He
text: cocks an eyebrow at Maurice. Maurice arches both eyebrows, a
text: smile spreading on his face. Brian hands the penlight to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It's not very big...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: (sagely)
dialog: In the land of the blind, the one-
dialog: eyed man is king.
dialog: 
text: He loses his wise composure, and grins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Catch ya later, Maurice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAURICE
dialog: Not if I catch you first.
dialog: 
text: He slips back into the shadow, and is gone. Brian pulls out his
text: watch: the sweep second hand ticks to the twelve-- Brian looks
text: up, and the sun clears the horizon. Brian puts his hand to the
text: shadow, trying to reach through it, trying to reach Maurice. It
dialog: is only a shadow.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Brian turns away from the bed, away from the others. Todd

text: Brian looks up at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Thanks for the help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIERSTEN
dialog: All you had to do was ask.
dialog: 
text: Eric puts his hand on Brian's shoulder. Holly and Glen come up
text: the stairs, spot Eric, hurry into the room, relieved and happy.
dialog: 
text: Glen and Holly hug Eric, Brian a little to the side. Eric looks
text: over at him; they smile at each other. Glen reaches out, pulls
