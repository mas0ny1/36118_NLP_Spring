dialog: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY
dialog: Mancini's "Ave Maria" fills the screen as a white BMW speeds along the road.
speaker_heading: CREDITS ROLL
text: A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is behind the wheel. We never see her face. Hanging from the mirror is a rosary with a crucifix. Her porcelain hand turns up the volume and the music swells. A silver bracelet dangles from her wrist.
dialog: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: A slow-moving semi obstructs her path. The woman leans out the window to see if the road is clear before moving into the oncoming lane. She steps on the gas. She's in the wrong lane and can't get over. There are headlights in the distance and the moan of an airhorn is heard.
dialog: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Suddenly, the headlights are upon her. And airhorn blasts and she's trapped between two monstrous big rigs. She cuts the wheel hard, but too late. The oncoming truck clips her, sending her car end over end.
dialog: SLO-MO
text: The accident is violent and horrible. The BMW cartwheels along the highway in a grotesque ballet of destruction. The music crescendos and sparks fly as the car skids along the pavement on its roof. And as the BMW violently smashes headfirst into the embankment, the beautiful woman is slammed into the windshield like a crash-test dummy.
dialog: EXT. MIDDLE AMERICAN TOWN - PRE-DAWN
text: The indigo horizon shimmers with the first light of morning. Vapor spewing smokestacks dwarf brick and mortar homes. Dairy Queens, Hardee's, and Walmarts line the main drag. Stars and Stripes flutter from lampposts.
dialog: INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
text: A man sits propped up against pillows, his sleeping wife snuggled next to him. His name is JOHN QUINCY ARCHIBALD. His strong, handsome face is beginning to show wear and tear. From across the room, last night's news broadcast drones on the TV. The President is telling everybody how wonderful the country is doing.
text: JOHN Q. watches impassively, the irony not lost on him. Suddenly, he hears a noise. Something's not right. He jumps out of bed, wearing only a pair of BVDs.
dialog: WIFE
dialog: Honey, what is it?
dialog: EXT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - MORNING
text: The screen door bangs open. John Q. bursts onto the porch to find a tow truck parked in front of his house. TWO TRUCKERS are winching a hook and cable to a ten year old Chevy.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Hey, what the hell are you doing?
dialog: TOW TRUCK DRIVER #1
dialog: What does it look like?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Aw, come on. That's my car.
dialog: TOW TRUCK DRIVER #1
dialog: Yeah? That's not what the bank says.
text: The truckers quickly circle to the front and hop in. John Q. just watches as the truck speeds away, dragging the car along the cement.
text: The neighbors now stand on their porches, staring. J.Q. turns to see his wife, DENISE, standing in the doorway. She's not a happy camper.
dialog: Their nine year old son, MIKE, appears at his mother's side, wiping the sleep from his eyes.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: What's going on?
scene_heading: INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: CLOSE ON a hand circling want-ads in red ink. J.Q. sits at the kitchen table drinking a half-filled cup of coffee, his eyes scouring the classifides.

dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Sorry.

dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: I talked to the bank. They promised they'd work with me.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Okay.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I did.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: John, that was two months ago.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: We've got enough money for next month's rent. That's it. It was either the car or the house, so I thought...
dialog: DENISE
dialog: You thought.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What did you want me to do? Have us put out on the street? I'm down to twenty hours a week a the plant. They shipped off half the damn jobs down to Mexico.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: My car is gone, John.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: You know I'm out there trying to find a second job.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: What do you want me to say? That it's fine? Alright, it's fine.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: The car's still ours, Denise. We own it. All we have to do is wait two weeks until my check comes in.
dialog: Mike enters dressed for school. He strikes a body builder's pose, flexing.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Yah! Ronnie Coleman, Mr. Olympics two years running. Yah!
dialog: He moves to the bread box and grabs a donut.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Sit down, honey. Eat some breakfast.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: (mouthful of food)
dialog: I am eating.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: A donut isn't breakfast.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Yeah it is. It's a continental breakfast.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Yeah, well, you're not a continent right now.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Uh, Dad, what do you call North America?
dialog: Denise sets down two plates of hot food.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Enough about that. You're not going to school without breakfast. Now eat. Both of you.
dialog: Mike and John Q. wolf down their food three bites at a time.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: I can't believe those jerks took our car, can you, Mom?
dialog: Denise gives J.Q. the hairy eyeball.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: No, I can't.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: What are we going to do? You're not going to do something, right, Dad? You know what I'd do? I'd get so big and mad, I'd just go crazy and kick someone's butt.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Watch your language.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: I would. I swear. When I grow up I'll be so strong no one will ever take nothing from us.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: You've been watching too much of that W.W. wrestling.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Not wrestling, Dad. Body building. There's a big difference.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Alright, alright. Get your books. You're going to be late.
dialog: Mike runs out of the room. Denise starts to clear the table.

dialog: EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY
text: It's a tailgate party. Parents lugging ice chests, making sandwiches, barbecuing. In the bleachers, John, Denise, Jimmy Palumbo, and his wife, GINA, cheer on the home team. The wives are really loud.

dialog: Let's go, Orioles!
dialog: GINA
dialog: Pitcher's got a rubber arm!
dialog: The Dodger pitcher stretches, fires a fastball. The batter takes the pitch.
dialog: UMPIRE
dialog: Ball four!
dialog: Tommy trots down to first base.
dialog: JIMMY
dialog: Way to go, Tommy. Good eye. Walk's as good as a hit.
dialog: Mike steps to the plate. Family and friends cheer wildly.

dialog: Yeah, Mike! Drive him home, baby! You can do it!
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Hey, pitcher! Hey, pitcher!
dialog: The pitcher smokes one down the middle. Mike swings. Nothing but air.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: That's okay, Mikey. Put the bat on the ball.
dialog: The pitcher burns one on the outside corner.
dialog: UMPIRE
dialog: Strike two!
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Hey, ump, you're blind! I hate this pitcher. How old is he, anyway?
dialog: GINA
dialog: He's supposed to be twelve.
dialog: JIMMY
dialog: Twelve, my ass. Look at him. His beard just grew an inch between pitches!
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Don't let him rattle you, Mikey. Wait for your pitch.
text: The catcher flashes fingers. The pitcher nods and fires. Mike hits a sharp ground ball between first and second. The second baseman moves over but doesn't have the angle.
text: The first baseman charges the ball, scoops it on the run, then underhands it to the Dodger pitcher, who gallops off the mound towards first.
text: Mike's foot hits the bag at exactly the same time the ball plops in the pitcher's outstretched glove.

text: Seeing an opening, Mike races from first to second, arms pumping, breathing hard. The Dodger shortstop sees Mike, races to the base and calls for the throw.
dialog: DODGER SHORTSTOP
dialog: Second base!
dialog: The Dodger catcher throws off his mask and fires the ball.
text: CLOSE ON MIKE, slowing, suddenly clutching his chest, gulping for air, ten feet from the base. SMACK. The ball lands in the shortstop's glove.
text: Mike wobbles, doubles over and falls face first into the dirt. The Dodger shortstop stands over Mike. He can't decide if he should tag him. Players, spectators look on dazed, shocked.

dialog: J.Q.

dialog: Help! My son can't breathe! I need help here! Can somebody please...
text: A male nurse, LEO MAGUIRE, leaves what he's doing and moves towards them. He clutches Mike's wrist, taking his pulse.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: What happened?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I don't know. He had a baseball game. All of a sudden he...
dialog: Maguire passes a female nurse in the hallway.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: I need a doctor right away. Room 6.
dialog: INT. RESUSCITATION ROOM - DAY
text: Maguire helps J.Q. lower Mike onto an examination table, and immediately several emergency technicians start applying the resuscitation equipment. Their movements are swift and precise. A blood pressure cuff is wrapped around Mike's arm, an oxymeter to the tip of his finger, and sensors are stuck all over his chest.
dialog: The E.R. doctor is MARJORIE KLEIN, early 30's. Klein is all business, assessing Mike's condition.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: Pulse is 150. B.P. 68 over 34. Collapsed playing baseball.
dialog: J.Q. notices Maguire glancing worriedly at Klein.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: He was running. Next thing we know he keels over.
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: Anything like this ever happen before?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Never. No, ma'am. Never.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: Pulse is seventy-eight percent.
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: Let's get him on some oxygen.
text: Maguire reaches for the Oxygen tank, lays the mask over Mike's nose, turns the screw. As Mike inhales the hissing air, Klein turns Mike on his side, probes his lung and lower back areas.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: He's going to be alright, isn't he?
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: The lungs are wet and his liver feels enlarged. Five mil I.V. Digoxin, stat.
dialog: Maguire moves to the counter, finds an I.V. needle, fills it with Digoxin.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: What's the matter with him?
dialog: Just then, another R.N. charges in. Klein "eyes" the nurse who immediately picks up on the look.
dialog: R.N.
dialog: Mr. and Mrs. Archibald, would you come with me?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What?
dialog: R.N.
dialog: He's in good hands. Please, there's a few procedures we need to go over.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What kind of procedures?
text: The R.N. gently takes J.Q.'s elbow. J.Q. pushes her hand away.
dialog: R.N.
dialog: We're going to be admitting your son, sir. You'll need to fill out the proper forms.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: For godsakes, can't the forms wait?
text: John and Denise watch helplessly as Maguire stabs an I.V. needle into Mike's vein.
dialog: R.N.
dialog: Please, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. It's possible your son may need a transfusion. We'll need to test you both for blood types.
dialog: The R.N. edges them out as SWOOSH, the divider curtain is pulled shut.

dialog: Your card, Mr. Archibald?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Huh?
dialog: ADMITTING NURSE
dialog: Your insurance card. I'll need to make a copy for our files.
text: J.Q. pulls out his wallet, fumbles for his card, hands it to the admitting nurse. INT. PEDIATRIC I.C.U. - DAY
text: J.Q. and Denise walk past rows of quiet, glassed-in rooms full of patients and life-support machines. They enter Mike's room to find REGGIE, a twenty-four year old nurse, hooking Mike up to the high monitor above the bed.
text: Mike is lying supine, awake but groggy, hooked up to a heart monitor, IV drips, hideous plastic tubes up his nose, down his throat, on full inotropic support. Denise leans over, kisses Mike.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Hi, sweetheart.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Hey, slugger, how are you doing?
dialog: Mike smiles weakly, struggles to speak, points to the tubes.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: I can't...talk.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Relax, buddy. Get some rest.
dialog: Mike closes his eyes. He's really out of it.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you, kid.
dialog: Denise reacts to all the flashing numbers on the monitors.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: What's all this?
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: This is so we can monitor Mike's vitals. Respiratory rate. Pulse oximetry. Heart rate. And this one is blood pressure. Diastolic and systolic.
text: Reggie points to a bank of monitors. In the middle is a flashing number 88.
speaker_heading: REGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: We'd like this top number to stay above ninety, but between eighty-five and ninety is acceptable for now. Anything less than eighty is dangerous. If his blood pressure drops, we're going to have to do something. We can't have him going below seventy again.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: What would that mean?
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: Seventy and below, he's in heart failure.
text: Reggie exits. J.Q. and Denise watch the blood pressure monitor, holding steady at 88. Plink. Suddenly, the number drops a notch to 87.

text: Eight members Hope Memorial Hospital's administrative staff are seated at a long conference table. Among them are DR. RAYMOND TURNER, mid-40's, REBECCA PAYNE, Hope Memorial Hospital's Administrative Supervisor, and Dr. Marjorie Klein.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: The father works part-time. Mother's a cashier in a supermarket.
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: how's the family's insurance?
dialog: She shakes her head - "we've got a problem." Payne sees J.Q. and Denise enter and she is immediately on her feet.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Rebecca Payne, hospital director. This is Doctor Turner, head of our cardiology department.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: How's our boy doing?
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Please sit down.
text: John and Denise sit, and the lights are dimmed. Dr. Turner approaches an illuminated display of X-rays. He uses a pointer to clarify.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: This X-ray is that of a normal, nine year old heart. This one is your son's.
dialog: John Q. and Denise stare nervously at the fleshy fist-sized organs on the translucent glass.
speaker_heading: DR. TURNER (CONT'D)
dialog: There are septal defects here, here, and here, which have induced a myopathy resulting pulmonary edema, and malignant ventricular ectopy. As you can see, Mike's heart is approximately three times normal size.
dialog: He points to Mike's heart, huge in comparison.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I'm sorry. I don't understand. Could you pout that in layman's terms?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Of course. Basically, there's not enough blood being pumped by the heart, so it backs up in the lungs. Sort of like a sponge getting wet. Mike's heart is trying, but I'm afraid it's working too hard.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: So what's he need? An operation?
dialog: Turner gathers himself, takes off his glasses.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: I'm afraid we're considerably beyond the point of corrective surgery, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Your son's heart is useless. He is going to need a transplant.
dialog: The room goes silent.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: He's nine.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Wait a second. There are other options.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What options?
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: To do nothing. Medicate him. Keep him as comfortable as possible. You need to start thinking about quality of life now.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: I don't understand. We were just with him. He seemed fine.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: He's going to seem fine. But as his heart gets worse, he will become increasingly fatigued, need more and more sleep, until one day, he'll go to sleep and he won't wake up.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: I know it's difficult, but you must face the fact that your son may not have much time left. You might want to make it a happy time. Say goodbye.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Oh my God.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: And transplantation is a high risk operation. You could lose your son on the table. You may not want to take that chance.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What do you think, Dr. Turner?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: This isn't my decision.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I know that. I'm asking for your opinion. Without surgery, how long does he have?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Not long. Months. Weeks. Days.
text: This is too much for Denise. She breaks into tears. John puts his arms around her, steadies her, gathers his thoughts.

dialog: Not you. Him.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: I'd do the transplant. Absolutely.
dialog: J.Q. looks at Denise, who nods.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Okay. Let's do it.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: The first step is to get Mike's name on an organ recipient list. Once he does, his chances are very good. Your son's an extremely rare type so there's less demand. With B-positive blood, Mike could go to the top of the list right away.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: It's not that simple. There are other considerations before a prospective recipient is placed on the donor list, Mr. Archibald. The cost of transplant surgery is expensive. In most cases, prohibitively so.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I've got major medical. Don't worry, I'm covered.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Actually, we've already checked with your carrier. There's no provision in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: There must be some kind of mistake. My son is covered. I've got full medical. He's covered.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: What about you, Mrs. Archibald? Do you have coverage?
dialog: DENISE
dialog: No. I've only been working at the market a short time. You need to be there two years before you get benefits.
dialog: Payne flips through the Archibald family file.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: I see that you don't own your own home. No investments, stocks, bonds. And you have a little over one thousand in savings.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Did you hear what I said? I'm telling you, I'm insured.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: That may very well be, but you'll have to check with your carrier on that. In the meantime, I'm afraid we're going to have to treat you as a cash account.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: How much does a transplant cost?
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Transplant surgery, doctor fees, post operative treatment and immunosuppressant drugs, you're looking at two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars minimum.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What are you saying? If I don't come up with a quarter million dollars you're not going to treat my son?
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: We have treated him. We continue to treat him. Now I understand how upset you are, sir. But with other options available, we are not obligated to cover a procedure this costly. If you opt for replacement surgery, that's your choice. But the hospital maintains a very strict policy with respect to cash patients. We require a down payment before the patient's name can be placed on the receiver list.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: What kind of down payment?
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Thirty percent. Seventy-five thousand.
dialog: J.Q. Seventy-five thousand dollars to put my kid's name on a list?
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Our son is upstairs dying and all you can talk about is money?
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Yes, it takes money to provide health service. It's expensive for you and for us. My job is to keep this program alive. For everyone. Now, I'm sorry, but we need you to guarantee payment before we can place your son's name on the list.

dialog: Trust me. You don't want to do that.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I don't, huh? Watch me. It's a county hospital. They have to treat him.
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: No they don't. Transplantation is always considered an elective procedure. This hospital's politics are particularly infuriating, but you're in the right place. Believe me. You want Dr. Turner. His bedside manner is terrible, but he's one of the foremost surgeons in the country.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What do you want us to do? You heard Payne. We're a cash account.
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: I know it's outrageous, but don't give up. Talk to your insurance company. Check with our Human Resources Department for medical assistance, State Children's Services, Medicaid. Just don't take no for an answer.

dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Changed?
speaker_heading: INSURANCE REP.
dialog: We've recently switched carriers from a PPO to an HMO. It's a less expensive policy, but unfortunately it has some restrictions.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What kind of restrictions?
speaker_heading: INSURANCE REP.
dialog: This is how it works. Non-management, part-time employees such as yourself only qualify for second tier catastrophic coverage.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: But I'm not part-time. I'm a full-time employee. It's just slow right now.
speaker_heading: INSURANCE REP.
dialog: Sure. But your coverage is based on house worked. Like I said, you only qualify for second tier, and that has a maximum payout limit of twenty-thousand dollars.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Wait a minute. I've been paying for my coverage for years. You take it out of my paycheck every week.
speaker_heading: INSURANCE REP.
dialog: And that's why we're going to cover you for the full twenty.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Let me get this straight. You drop me from full-time to part-time, switch carriers, and now you're telling me I'm not fully covered even though I have a policy that says I am.
speaker_heading: INSURANCE REP.
dialog: Doesn't seem right, does it?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: No, sir. It doesn't. My son is very sick. If I'm not covered, I've got a serious problem.
speaker_heading: INSURANCE REP.
dialog: I understand that, but there's nothing I can do. You might want to try State Services. Either that, or you can file an appeal.

dialog: J.Q.
dialog: So what? What's the difference?
dialog: COUNTY EMPLOYEE
dialog: Big difference. It means it's a pre existing condition, one your son was born with. A birth defect. Obviously, it pre-dates your coverage. Otherwise we could help.

text: J.Q. studies Maguire's eyes, measures his honesty, and then unchains the door and opens it, pointing the weapon. The paramedics see J.Q.'s gun and their hands go up.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: You, open your coat.
dialog: PARAMEDIC #1
dialog: What?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: You heard me. Take the coat off. Cop.
dialog: Paramedic #1 takes off his coat. There's nothing underneath. He's not police.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, then. Leave the stretcher. Go. Beat it.
text: The paramedics back away and take off. Maguire rolls the stretcher inside, and J.Q. re-locks the doors.
dialog: MAN ON STRETCHER
dialog: (name's STAWITZKY)
dialog: I gave them all the money in the register. They shot me anyway.
text: J.Q. peels back a corner of the blanket, looks for weapons, recoils at the sight of the man's blood. Maguire moves in, squeezes the man's wrist, takes his pulse.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: We need to prep this man for immediate surgery. He's in boo-koo trouble. Doctor?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: No, no. This is out of my department. I'm a heart surgeon. I'm not an emergency room physician.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: You are now.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Come on, Doctor. It's like riding a bike. Pretend you're getting paid.
dialog: Turner and J.Q. lock eyes.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: Do it.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Seventy-five milligrams Demerol IV Lidocaine, local. Two percent.
text: Turner takes the man's pulse as they roll the stretcher towards the trauma room. J.Q. watches the anesthesia cup placed over the man's nose and he goes down for the count. Mitch fires a look at the stocky security guard.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: When I get out of here, I'm suing this hospital and your security company.
dialog: Unseen by Mitch, J.Q. has moved behind him.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What makes you so sure you're getting out of here at all?
text: Mitch sits back down. J.Q. leans against a wall, takes a breath. Suddenly, he hears the woop-woop of police sirens. He looks out the window and sees police cars storming the front of the hospital. The cavalry has arrived.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: Here we go.
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY
text: The summer sun beats down as cop cars careen into the parking lot. Behind them, an unmarked Crown Victoria plows slowly through a growing crowd. LIEUTENANT FRANK GRIMES bails out before the car stops, smoothing out the wrinkles in his rumpled suit. He reacts with surprise when he sees veteran, on-the-spot news reporter, Tuck Lampley, already on the scene with his camera crew.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: What are you doing here, Lampley? Shouldn't you be out exposing tragic miscarriages or justice or something?
dialog: LAMPLEY
dialog: Yeah, well, screw you, too.
dialog: Grimes pushes past, but Lampley dogs him.
speaker_heading: LAMPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: There's a rumor floating around, Frank. Some guy's holding the hospital hostage. Needs an operation for his kid. Any truth to it?
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: You know more than I do.
dialog: LAMPLEY
dialog: You're full of shit.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Hey, then we're even. I never believe a word you guys say either.
dialog: LAMPLEY
dialog: This is big, isn't it, Frank? I can feel it. Come on, what do you got?
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Zip. Nothing. Read my lips. I just got here. But I promise, as soon as I know anything, you'll be the last to know.
dialog: LAMPLEY
dialog: Hey, Grimes. You're a real horse's ass. You know that?
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Yeah, well...
text: Grimes chuckles as he moves past the police barricade, sizing up his territory. He runs into swat team SERGEANT TIM MOODY, already on the scene. Moody's accompanied by the pimply faced security guard who phoned it in.
dialog: MOODY
dialog: This guy's in for the long haul, Lieutenant. He locked down the ER, barricaded himself inside, killed the power on the elevators. We could bust down the door, but the sonofabitch might start killing everybody.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Any other way in?
dialog: MOODY
dialog: I'm working on it.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: How many hostages?
dialog: MOODY
dialog: Security guard here said there could be anywhere from ten to twenty.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Any security cameras?
dialog: PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD
dialog: The guy took out the one in the ER, sir. But the hospital has two covert pinpoints hidden inside the treatment facility.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Pinpoint cameras? I don't understand.
dialog: PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD
dialog: The hospital's own private security. Every hospital has them, in case a mental patient goes crazy or an employee starts stealing pharmaceuticals.
dialog: MOODY
dialog: They're hidden in the walls throughout the hospital. There's two inside the ER area.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Can we get them?
dialog: MOODY
dialog: We're setting up a video tap right now. Should be up and running in a few minutes.
dialog: Grimes looks at the pimply-faced kid.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Are you in charge of security?
dialog: PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD
dialog: No, sir. That'd be Wally Pitoniak. He's at home. It's his day off.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Not anymore it ain't. Get him down here.
dialog: (to Moody)
dialog: I need to make contact with this guy. Can you get me a secure line?
dialog: PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Lieutenant? One of our guys is on the inside. He's got a walkie-talk. You might want to give this a shot.
dialog: The kid hands Grimes his walkie-talkie.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Alright, but put a clamp on all phone lines to the Emergency Room. If he picks up the phone, I want him talking to me.
dialog: MOODY
dialog: Got it.
dialog: Grimes looks around, sees more news vans arriving.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: And keep the media on a need to know basis. Until I say so, the press doesn't need to know nothing. Now who's in charge of this hospital?
dialog: PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Rebecca Payne, sir. She's off today, too.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Jesus Christ. Does anyone work at this hospital?
dialog: PIMPLY FACED SECURITY GUARD
dialog: It's Saturday.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: So what? People get sick on Saturday, don't they?

dialog: She's fine, ain't she? All that and twenty-two years old. Little slice of heaven. Must be doing something right, am I right?

dialog: Call me John Q.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Alright, John Q. Again, my name is Lieutenant Grimes. But I want you to call me Frank. Can you do that?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Sure, Frank.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: I'm the hostage negotiator. I've been a cop for thirty-five years and this is all I do. I don't play games. And I don't fool around. So if I say something, you can take it to the bank. Now, let's get down to it. Is anybody hurt?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: It's an Emergency Room, Frank. Everybody's hurt.

dialog: Murphy's Law, John. You picked the hottest day of the year. It's a hundred degrees out here. And I'm allergic to the heat. So let's wrap this up as quickly as possible. Now, what exactly is it you want?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Find Rebecca Payne, Hope Memorial's Administrative Supervisor. Tell her I want my kid's name on the donor list.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Kid? Boy or girl?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Boy.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: How old? You know, I've got two boys. Two girls and two boys.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Don't handle me, Frank. I don't want to be handled. It insults my intelligence. If I don't get what I want, you're going to have a lot of dead bodies on your hands. You only need to remember two things. My kid and the donor list. You got that?
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Take it easy, John. The idea's not to get too excited.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Mike's name goes on that list or there's going to be a blood bath in here.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Alright. I hear you loud and clear. Rebecca Payne, right? I'm writing it down. Lot of cops out here, John. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I'm sure.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Alright. Sit tight. You're in a tough spot, John. A lot of trouble. But if you work with me, if you're reasonable, we'll figure a way out of this. We have to have a little faith in one another.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Why?
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Why? Because that's what faith's all about. Believing when you don't want to believe. Besides, what else are you going to do?
dialog: J.Q.

dialog: DEBBY
dialog: Mr. Q? Would you really do it?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What?
dialog: DEBBY
dialog: What you said about the bloodbath? Would you really shoot us?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I'll do what I have to do to help my kid.

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: His airbag went off. Mine didn't.

dialog: MITCH
dialog: Sixteen valve. One point six liter. It does about a hundred and eighty in reverse.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Wow. Pretty snazzy. What year?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: 1986. It's a classic.
dialog: The other hostages study J.Q. Where is he going with this?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Yeah, well, I've got news for you, Mitch. Mercedes didn't install passenger airbags until 1988.
text: A long uncomfortable silence ensues as the group looks at Mitch, realizing the obvious. Busted.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: I was drunk. Alright?
text: Tears stream down Julie's proud face, for the first time, Mitch is speechless. He looks like a car that won't start. Finally, he gets up and walks away.

dialog: CLOSE ON
text: Monitor. Plink. Mike's blood pressure drops from 75 to 74. Mike is resting, eyes closed. Denise stands vigilantly by Mike's bedside. Reggie enters. Carrying an armload of medicine. He replaces the IV bag and starts to administer the meds. One after the other, Reggie injects them into the IV line, and Mike stirs.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: What's that?
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: Lasix. It's a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid build-up. But it's potassium sparing, so he needs this one to supplement.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: And those?
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: Dopamine. For his blood pressure. Dig for his heart. Primacor.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Gosh, it seems like so much.
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: Yeah, it's a lot. This is antibiotic.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: What for?
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: It's prophylactic. Just in case. These two, I don't really know what they're for. Pain, maybe.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Pain?
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: I don't know, Mrs. Archibald. I just do what they tell me.
dialog: Mike groans. He feels queasy and his mouth is bone dry.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: I don't feel good.
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: This is going to make you feel yucky for a few minutes, buddy. But I'm going to get you some of those crunchy ice chips to chew on. How does that sound?
text: Mike forces a smile, dips his head slightly. "Sounds good." Reggie leaves the room. Something catches Denise's eye. Down the Pediatric ICU, she sees the hospital chaplain again. There is a commotion. The parents are crying. And a sheet is pulled over her face of the now dead child. The chaplain tries to console the devastated mother, who screams as her child is wheeled out of the room.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Mom? Is Dad coming?
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Yeah. He's coming.

dialog: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: What are you up to?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Never mind me. You're worthless. You know that? Some security guard. You should have zapped the bastard.
dialog: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: With what? Besides, I'm not putting my neck on the line. Not for eight-fifty an hour.
text: Mitch reaches, pulls a cas cart closer. He carefully slides open a drawer, steals a sharp-edged scalpel, slips it into his pocket. Next he spots a spray top cannister marked Ethychloride.

dialog: Yeah? He finds out you got a scalpel, you're the one that's history, asshole.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Really? He doesn't look so bad to me.

dialog: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
text: The vending machines have been jimmied open and a huge pile of candy bars and soda cans sit on the waiting room table. Everybody is chowing down.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: The thing I don't understand is why no one caught it before. Mike had check ups every year since the day he was born. Why didn't his doctors pick it up?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Was he ever diagnosed with a murmur?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Yeah, he was. About a week after he was born. But his doctor said that was normal. That it happens all the time.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: He might not have been tested thoroughly enough.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Why not?
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: You got an HMO, right? There's your answer. HMO's pay their doctors not to test. Their way of keeping costs down. Let's say Mike needed additional testing, insurance says they won't cover them. The doctor keeps his mouth shut and no one's the wiser. Little Mike falls through the cracks, and come Christmas, the HMO sends the doc a big, fat bonus check. J.Q. looks at Turner.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Is that true?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Possible. Not likely, but possible.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Then Mike's doctors could have known about his condition all along? And he could have been treated years ago?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Who knows?
dialog: LESTER
dialog: Nothing personal, Doc, but you all are a bunch of damn crooks.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: You see,here's the problem. Over here, you've got your insurance companies who basically want you healthy or dead. That's how they make money. And over here, you've got your medical establishment, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, who don't want you healthy or dead. They want you sick. That's the way they make money.
dialog: LESTER
dialog: It's all about getting paid, man.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: And the individual is caught in the middle of this gigantic tug-of-war. It's a game. And the end result is, people don't get the treatment they deserve.
dialog: LESTER
dialog: Because then no one gets paid.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: But what about that thing you guys take? That promise? What do they call it?
dialog: STEVE
dialog: The Hippocratic oath.
dialog: LESTER
dialog: More like the hipp-crit-cial Oath to me. How's that go, Doc? "I solemnly swear to take care of all sick folk, except those without major medical?"
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: I'm telling you, it's not that far from the truth. The shit happens all the time. Paramedics bring in some accident victim gasping for his last breath. Big boys in accounting find out they can't pay, they send them packing.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Hospitals can't turn people away.
dialog: STEVE
dialog: Yeah. I thought there were laws about that.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: There are laws. But there are also ways around the laws. All we have to do is stabilize them. After that, we're off the hook.
dialog: Turner is getting hot.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: That's not how it works.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: That's exactly how it works. Maybe not up there on the fifth floor, but down here, if you ain't got no money, you get a band-aid, a foot in the ass, and you're out the door.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Is that how you paid for that Armani suit, Doc?
dialog: Finally, Turner explodes.
dialog: DR. TURNER
text: Shut up. Enough already. I've heard all the bitching and moaning I can stand. Sure, the system sucks. There's red tape and there's worse. There's tough luck. And if you're looking for kindness and compassion, they're in short supply these days. But some of us got into medicine to do something about it. I break my ass every day trying to make a difference, trying to plug the dam. I'm in it up to my elbows. I've seen people live who shouldn't, and the other way around. And when I say I do my best, I mean it. So don't tell me about doctors, because they're the last stop between you and six feet under. And if you all want to regard me as some blood sucking vampire, fine. I'm the bad guy. But who's holding the fucking gun?
dialog: Turner gets up and walks into the treatment room.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Wow.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: What's his problem?
dialog: STEVE
dialog: I've got to be honest, if my kid was dying and I couldn't get help, I don't know what I'd do.
dialog: DEBBY

dialog: Honey, for godsakes, just do as the man says. Get out of here.
dialog: MIRIAM
dialog: I'm not leaving you here alone.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Shit, I'll go.
dialog: STEVE
dialog: Shut your face. What kind of man are you?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Screw you, Tyrone.
text: Steve leaps from his seat and goes after Mitch, bristling with the racial slur. J.Q. moves in fast, trying to separate them. But instead of going for Steve, Mitch goes for broke and rushes J.Q. The Ethylchloride is out and Mitch sprays it into J.Q.'s eyes, temporarily blinding him.
text: John tries to get his bearings but Mitch is already swinging the scalpel. As J.Q. blocks the knife, his arm is sliced and starts to gush. Mitch goes for the kill, but J.Q. grabs his arm and they wrestle to the ground, the scalpel and John's gun clattering to the floor. The element of surprise gone, Mitch is now getting the worst of it. J.Q. is getting in some heavy blows and no one is stepping in to stop it. Mitch sees the gun across the floor next to Julie.
dialog: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Julie, baby, get the gun.
dialog: Julie gets up.
dialog: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Shoot him, honey. Shoot him.
text: But instead of grabbing the weapon, she picks up the Ethylchloride, sprays it directly in Mitch's eyes from superclose range and doesn't stop. Mitch's hands fly to his eyes and he screams. J.Q. gets up and recovers his weapon, sticking it in his waistband. Julie stands over Mitch, who is still writhing in pain.
dialog: MITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: You stupid bitch!
dialog: Julie rears back, and with her go-go boot, she kicks Mitch square in the groin.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: That's for beating the shit out of me.
dialog: She kicks him again.
speaker_heading: JULIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's for being an asshole.
dialog: Once more for good measure.
speaker_heading: JULIE (CONT'D)
dialog: And that's for calling me a bitch.
dialog: LESTER
dialog: Damn.
text: The hostages look at Julie with newfound respect. J.Q. takes the security guard's handcuffs, drags Mitch across the floor, and manacles him to the radiator.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Everybody's a tough guy.
dialog: Grimes voice crackles over the walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: GRIMES (O.S.)
dialog: Where are those hostages, John?
text: J.Q. moves to the door, unlocks the chain, points to Rosa and Miriam.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Let's go. Both of you.
text: Rosa launches into a rapid-fire monologue of thanks. She speaks quickly, saying the word "Dios" over and over.
dialog: DEBBY
dialog: What's she saying?
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: She said she'll pray for his boy.
dialog: Miriam kisses Steve, holds him tight.
dialog: STEVE
dialog: Everything's going to be okay. The baby is going to be just fine.
dialog: J.Q. puts a hand on Steve's shoulder.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Get out of here. Go.
dialog: Steve is stunned. Can't get to his feet.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: Vasta. Vasta. Let's go.
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY
dialog: The front door opens and Steve, Miriam, Rosa and the baby are released. We see Channel 8 reporter Tuck Lampley doing a live "stand up."
dialog: LAMPLEY
text: The gunman has just freed several hostages who will immediately be debriefed by members of the crisis team. Will the man known as John Q. get a heart for his little boy? Time will tell. Where this leads next is anyone's guess. Live from Hope Memorial Hospital, this is Tuck Lampley.
text: The hostages are hustled through the police barricade by a team of kevlar riot police. The media rush the hostages, shouting out questions and frantically trying to stick their microphones close enough.
dialog: REPORTER #1
dialog: Is it true an ambulance dropped off a gunshot victim after the gunman took over the ER?
dialog: MIRIAM
dialog: Yes. He unlocked the door and let him in.
dialog: STEVE
dialog: If he didn't, the man would have died.
dialog: ROSA
dialog: John Q. very good man.
dialog: REPORTER #2
dialog: The gunman?
dialog: ROSA
dialog: Si. Good man, el senor.
text: But Tuck Lampley's attention is on the police command post where dozens of blue uniforms crowd around a small bank of monitors. Suddenly, it hits him.
dialog: LAMPLEY
dialog: They've got a camera in there. I don't believe it. They're watching a video feed.
dialog: Freddy B. squints through the glasses.
speaker_heading: FREDDY B.
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: LAMPLEY
dialog: Well, they're looking at something, Freddy. And I need to know what it is. Can you steal it?
speaker_heading: FREDDY B.
dialog: No problem, boss. If they got it, I can get it.
dialog: EXT. COMMAND POST - DAY
text: WALLY PITONIAK, Chief of Hospital Security, has arrived. He and Sergeant Moody are standing over an unrolled building plan that has been stretched across the command table like a battle map. Monroe and Grimes have Rebecca Payne on the defensive.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: You mean all of this could have been avoided if you had just put the kid's name on a list?
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Don't you dare try to blame this on me. You think Mr. Archibald is the only one with a sick child? Try the HIV ward. There's a whole floor full of them. People get sick. They die. That's the way it goes. I'm faced with tough decisions every day.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: The fact is there's a man threatening to kill innocent people because you refused treatment for his son.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: The fact is there are fifty million people in this country without medical insurance, sir. And there's one of me in every hospital. That's not my fault. It's just the way the country's set up. You want to change it? Write your congressman.
dialog: Moody looks over from his map.
dialog: MOODY
dialog: Excuse me, but why don't we just tell him his son's on the list? Doesn't that make sense? I mean, how's he going to know.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: That's not a bad idea.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: You want me to put his name on the list, fine, but it's a mistake. You give in to this man, there's going to be guns in every hospital in America.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: I don't personally care if you put the kid on it or not. That's your conscience. But give us a hand, will you honey? Work with us. Tell him his kid's going to be alright. Do you think you can do that?
dialog: Pitoniak has indicated a spot on the schematic by circling it with a red pen.
dialog: MOODY
dialog: Sir? Sir, take a look at this.
dialog: Monroe moves over.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: What is it?
dialog: Pitoniak points to the map, marking a red "X" through the circle.
speaker_heading: PITONIAK
dialog: It's a phone.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: So?
text: Moody points to one of the monitors. ON SCREEN, a view of the nurse's station and beyond. And in the foreground, big and clear as day, is the RED NURSES' PHONE.
dialog: MOODY
dialog: It's that phone.
dialog: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
dialog: More waiting.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: So, what now? What's the plan?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Mitch...
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No. I want to know. Every day you read about this kind of shit. And now we're in the middle of it. How is it going to end, John? This country, man. I swear to God. You can't go anywhere anymore without getting robbed, mugged, or murdered. Kids killing classmates, drive bys... I won't even go into a post office anymore.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: Shut up, Mitch.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: He's right. You know how easy it was to get this gun? One gun show. Five minutes.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: That's right. You're just a punk with a gun. I understand your kid is sick, but what makes him better than me? I've got a life, too.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Yeah, but you've got insurance.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: So, what, you're going to shoot me? Because that's what you're telling the cops. If poor little Mikey doesn't get the very first heart available, all of us die.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: No, I don't want to cheat anyone. I just want my kid to have a fair shot.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: So what's the plan, Stan? I mean, exactly? How long are you going to hold us hostage? Until your son gets a new heart?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Think, Einstein. Use your head. Correct me if I'm wrong, Doctor, but hearts don't come just like that. It takes months, years sometimes.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I know.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Then what's your move?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I'm not letting my kid die! I'm out of options, alright?! I have no more ideas. This is it. The end of the road. I'm looking for an act of God. I'm looking for a miracle.
dialog: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The white BMW speeds along the highway, tries to pass the semi in front of her, and smashes into the embankment. It's the same accident as before, only this time, it's regular speed.
dialog: INT. PEDIATRIC I.C.U. - DAY
dialog: Frank Grimes stands outside Mike's room, just watching him through the glass.
dialog: CLOSE ON MONITOR
text: Mike's blood pressure has fallen to 68. He is asleep, each breath magnified by the hollow, mechanized wheeze of the ventilator pump. Denise sits by his side, praying hard, tears rolling down her cheeks.
text: Payne arrives, and the two stand there a moment. Watching the scene, Grimes is visibly moved. Even Payne and her super bitch attitude are a little humbled.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: No matter how many times I see it, this is the part I always hate.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Do you have any children, Miss Payne?
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: No. No I don't.
dialog: They move to the doorway and tap lightly on the door.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Mrs. Archibald?
dialog: Denise's wet face turns to see the cause of the intrusion.
speaker_heading: GRIMES (CONT'D)
dialog: Could we have a word with you?
dialog: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
dialog: Denise, Grimes, and Payne by the elevators.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: This is my fault. When the hospital told me they were releasing Mikey, I was furious. I yelled at John to do something, anything. I never thought...
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: I understand. Is he a violent man, Mrs. Archibald.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: No. Heavens, no. He's gentle. He's sweet. He wouldn't hurt a fly.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: That's not what he's saying. He's talking about killing people. Has he spent any time in the military?
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Hey, what is this? I get what's going on here. You want me to tell you something you can use to hurt my husband.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: He's in a lot of trouble, Ma'am. We're going to need you to talk to him.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Let's get something straight, Mister. You can't use me to make a case against John. I support my husband. Whatever he does. I'm on his side. Not yours.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Mrs. Archibald...
dialog: DENISE
dialog: You, don't talk to me. I'd tell you what I think of you but I'm a Christian woman. Now you people leave me alone. I have a sick child to look after.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: I've decided to put Mike's name on the organ recipient list, Mrs. Archibald. The hospital will pay for everything.
dialog: Denise looks at Payne, not daring to believe.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Really.
text: Payne nods. This is too much for Denise. She throws her arms around Payne, sobbing tears of joy.
speaker_heading: DENISE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
dialog: Payne pats Denise on the back, awkwardly trying to comfort her.
scene_heading: INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDORS - DAY
dialog: Grimes and Payne move quickly through the corridors.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: You're good.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: With the Archibald woman back there. Quite a performance. The sincere look, the comforting embrace. For a minute, I almost believed you cared.
text: Payne's eyes flash with anger. She looks like she wants to say something, but she just turns and walks away.
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY
text: A restless crowd encircles the hospital, cordoned off by police blockades, uniformed cops forming a human wall around people. EMS rescue vehicles rumble onto the scene, sirens blaring.
text: A police bus drives slowly into the parking lot. A SWAT team, dressed in flak jackets and riot gear, pours out.
text: An armada of soft drink, hot dog and ice cream vendors smell gold, and stake out their claims. It's Saturday afternoon, and the circus is in town.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: J.Q. and the hostages watch Tuck Lampley on an overhead TV. Jimmy Palumbo is being interviewed. ON SCREEN, J.Q. sees the massive police build-up, swallows. He looks at the clock. 5:05 PM. Ten minutes and counting.
scene_heading: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A red and white medical helicopter descends from the sky. The accident scene is now secured by the flashing lights of police and medical teams. The screeching sound of cutting metal is heard as the rescuers use the jaws of life. As we see the car more closely now, we notice that the woman's arm rests out the open window. On her wrist is a silver donor bracelet.
dialog: EXT. COMMAND POST - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Grimes returns to find the post empty. Nobody there except a few policemen and Sergeant Moody, who is doing a check on his walkie.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: What's going on? Where is everybody?
dialog: Moody indicates the map and the monitor.
dialog: MOODY
dialog: We're sending in one of ours through the ventilation ducts.
dialog: ON SCREEN
dialog: He indicates the red nurses' phone.
speaker_heading: MOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: If we can get the target to that phone, it's a clear shot.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Is that right?
dialog: MOODY
dialog: Yes, Lieutenant. That is right.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: On who's orders?
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Police Chief Gus Monroe, Wally Pitoniak, and a SWAT Team are in strategy session. They surround a sniper decked out in HBT regalia. A green video mini-monitor is being checked and fastened to the front of the sniper's vest. In the distance, Grimes bursts into the parking garage.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Gus...
dialog: MONROE
dialog: Not one word. I don't want to hear one goddamn word out of you, Frank.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: I'm not going to say anything. I'm just going to go get you your red nose.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: What did you say to me? Are you calling me a clown?
dialog: Monroe goes after Grimes and has to be restrained.
speaker_heading: MONROE (CONT'D)
dialog: I swear to God, I'll kill you.
dialog: Boys. Boys.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: You going to do this behind my back, you sonofabitch?
dialog: MONROE
dialog: Check the time, Frank. Look at your watch, Frank. The guy said at a quarter after he was going to start killing everybody, and we don't have any reason not to believe him.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: So goddamn stupid.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: Yeah? What's your great idea?
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: There are no great ideas!
dialog: MONROE
dialog: Right! Exactly. But right now I've got a shot at this guy. I don't even know what we're talking about. You know the score. You always take the clear shot.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: The wife has agreed to speak to him. Let her talk him down.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: That's exactly what we're going to do.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: What? You use the man's wife to set him up?
dialog: MONROE
dialog: Whatever works. Let me paint a picture for you. And I hope it's clear. What we've got is a lose/lose. If this guy starts whacking out the hostages, it's bad, right? But if we give in to this asshole, it's also bad.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Bad for who?
dialog: MONROE
dialog: It's an election year. Do you want me to spell it out for you? A, B, C. However it goes down, this guy's not going to make it.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: So, you kill him? That's a P.R. bonanza.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: There's not going to be a slaughter in there. Not on my watch. You're out, Frank.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Out?
dialog: MONROE
dialog: Out. No hard feelings. But you're officially relieved of duty. I'll handle it from here.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: You?
dialog: MONROE
dialog: It's not my first trip around the dance floor, you know.
dialog: Grimes laughs out loud.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: Hey, I don't like it any better than you do, but I'm under a lot of pressure here. Everyone is wetting their pants on this one. Believe me, my ass is swinging in the breeze.
dialog: Monroe turns and walks away. Grimes calls out after him.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: What about the hostages?
dialog: MONROE
dialog: They better keep their heads down.

It's you and me, baby. All the girls in the club, they don't mean shit to me. It's only you. I'll get down on my knees if you want me to. Look, I'm on my knees in front of everyone. I'll even forget you kicked me in the nuts. Come on.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: No, Mitch. This is always how it goes. You treat me like shit, then come crawling back to me like Prince Charming. Not this time. It's over.

dialog: MITCH
dialog: Aw, come on. Don't do that. That ring cost me twenty grand.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Poor little rich boy. Used to getting everything he wants. Buying his way in and out of everything.

dialog: MITCH
dialog: Do you mind? Stay away from the ring, please.
dialog: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Hey, she don't want it.
dialog: LESTER
dialog: yeah. Finders keepers, man.
dialog: The hostages laugh and Mitch goes crazy.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Hey, what's so funny? Does everybody think this is a joke? You all should be thinking about your own lives, hoping that phone rings with some good news. Because in about five minutes, the road is going to get a lot narrower.
dialog: EXT. COMMAND POST - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Monroe moves outside and joins the other SWAT team personnel at the video tap. Grimes follows to plead his case.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: But he's not a wacko, Gus. Married with a family, no history of mental illness. No radical political views. He doesn't fit the profile.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: Don't matter. You know as well as I do that anybody can fit the profile at any time.
dialog: MOODY
dialog: He's got a gun and he's got hostages. That's a profile.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: How long have we been doing this? You've got to trust me on this one. Gus, I like the guy.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: Well I don't. I don't like nut jobs who point guns at innocent people. It pisses me off.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: He's not a nut job.
dialog: MONROE
text: Maybe you're right. Maybe he's bluffing. Maybe he's just a nice guy with a problem. Maybe he's misunderstood and needs to blow off a little steam. Hey, it's possible. But I can't depend on that, Frank. This asshole has raised the stakes real high. And I need to match it, just in case he's not bluffing. Now, we've got five minutes before he starts throwing bodies out the door. I've got a chance to end this right now and I'm taking it.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: I'm telling you, you're making a mistake.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: Yeah, well. We try harder.
dialog: GRIMES

scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

dialog: What about an El-vad?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: No.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What's an El-vad?
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: A left Ventricular Assist Device. It's basically a pump inserted into the chest cavity, wired to the heart to keep it stimulated.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: All this time there's been a way to save his life and you never said anything?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: It's not a solution. It's only a band aid. Mike's immune system may be too weak.

The crowd behind the barricade is huge now, holding up signs like "Have a Heart," "Save Mike," and "John Q. Public." They scream encouragement with J.Q.'s every move. As he comes forward, police and SWAT teams train their rifles on him.

dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I, I, I bullshit! You tried to kill me. You tried to kill me while I was talking to my boy!
text: The crowd erupts. They're getting rowdy now. The cops are getting jumpy, their rifles trained, their trigger fingers ready.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: John, listen to me. Lieutenant Grimes had nothing to do with that. It was my call.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Don't lie to me. I don't need to be bullshitted by some lying flunky cops.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: What are we, friends all of a sudden? All of a sudden, we owe you something? You pulled the gun. You're the one that took the hospital. What did you think would happen? You want truth Here's some truth. This is going to end up bad for you. There's only two ways out of here. Jail or dead.

dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I just want my life back.

dialog: I don't believe you.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: I give you my word.

dialog: GRIMES
text: Hey, what are you doing? Stay with me, John. You think these people give a shit about you? They don't. You're just the cause of the moment. Believe me, in a couple of days, they'll be outraged about something else. Nobody cares, John. That's the real truth. Nobody cares. Only you. It's only you and me out here, and all these guns pointed at you. So, what do you want to do? It's your call.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I want my son.

dialog: There's an operation that could save his life. I'm going to need some equipment but I've got two surgeons inside that are ready to go.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: You listen to me, you sonofabitch. You give this up right now, turn yourself in. And your son will have any and every means of assistance. If not, if you keep this up, this is going to be very bad for you.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Are you threatening me, Chief? Take your best shot. Oh, I forgot, you already did. No, we'll do this my way. You give me my boy, they do the surgery and then I give up. Nobody gets hurt and everyone goes home.
dialog: Monroe studies J.Q. and considers.
dialog: MONROE
dialog: What do you think, Frank?
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: I say give it to him. He's not going to hurt his boy.
dialog: Monroe takes his time making his decision.

dialog: DENISE
dialog: To see your father.
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - MAGIC HOUR
text: The front doors burst open and Mike's bed is rolled onto the sidewalk. COPS run alongside like secret service agents, protecting Mike, pushing a path through the crowd.
dialog: COPS
dialog: Coming through. Let's go. Move it back, folks.
text: The mob swarms around the speeding bed, trying to get a look at Mike, who considers the circus atmosphere surrounding him. As the bed hits the police barricade, the cops take over.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Let me through. I'm his mother.
dialog: But she is held back as Mike is ushered through.
dialog: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - MAGIC HOUR
text: Mike's bed is rolled slowly to a stop outside the ER doors. The sniper is released and J.Q. stands guard as Mike is rolled in by Turner and Maguire, before locking the door behind them.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Dad, where have you been?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Just waiting for you, buddy.

dialog: MIKE
dialog: I'm okay. Tired.
text: Beep. Beep. The monitors whisper faintly, irregularly, Turner steps in front of J.Q.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Out.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: What?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: I need some time to examine Mike and I don't need you getting in the way. It's crowded enough in here.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I'll stay in the corner.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: I'm serious, John. Let me do my job.
text: Turner ushers him out the door and closes it behind him. John looks up to find the hostages staring at him. Uncomfortable, he moves into a recovery room.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
text: J.Q., alone, notices the simple wooden cross hanging over the door. He stares at it a long time before kneeling, his arms resting on the bed.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Bless me, father. For I have sinned. It's been a long time, so forgive me if I'm a little rusty. I know you do things your own way. But I'm finding it hard to understand why you would want Mike to be so sick.
dialog: INT. MIKE'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
text: Turner administers the meds and Mike's eyes glaze and roll back in his head. With all the drugs coursing through his system, Mike is really out of it now. But as Dr. Turner diligently attends to Mike, the boy considers him, the bright O.R. lights casting a halo around the doctor's head.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Are you God?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: (caught off-guard)
dialog: Yeah, kid. Yeah, I am.

dialog: MIKE
dialog: Where you been?
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I keep waiting for you to step in and help him. But you never do. And I don't understand. I don't understand and I don't forgive. So, help me, Father. Because I'm trying. I'm really trying.
dialog: Dr. Turner appears at the doorway and sees John on his knees.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: John?
text: J.Q. looks up and Dr. Turner soberly shakes his head. The news isn't good.
scene_heading: INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - NIGHT
dialog: Dr. Turner and John look through the glass at Mike resting peacefully.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Mike's blood pressure has dropped into the mid-forties. His atrial blood pressure should be in the low teens. It's thirty-five. If I put that LVAD into him, his heart will never be able to handle the extra strain.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: But...
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Not buts, John. Without a new heart, he's not going to make it.
dialog: J.Q. is devastated. It takes a few moments to sink in.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Take mine.
dialog: Turner doesn't get it.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: What?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: You heard me. Take my heart and put it in Mike.

dialog: J.Q.
dialog: It's the only way.
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: No, you don't understand. You physically can't do it.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Why not? I kill myself. You cut me open and take my heart. It's perfect.
dialog: LESTER
dialog: The boy crazy.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Nutsy cuckoo, I'm telling you.
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: We just can't remove your heart and put it into Mike's body.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: There's too many unknowns. Matching a donor and receiver is extremely complicated. There's several critical tests that have to be taken.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Like what?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Cross matches for blood type, chest cavity measurements. If both blood tissues aren't compatible, there's a very high likelihood of rejection.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Come on, Doc. I know all about compatibility. We've been tested up the wazoo. Mike and I are both B-Positive. Our tissues are a match. And his heart is three times normal size which means mine will fit. You know damn well we're compatible.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: No, we don't. You're an adult. Mike is strong, but the amount of blood your heart pumps may be too much for Mike.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I'll take that chance. It's better than letting him die.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Out of the question. Too risky.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I'm telling you, he'll make it.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Can't do it, John.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: You're telling me that if I'm laying dead on the floor, you wouldn't take my heart and put it in my kid to save his life? You'd let two people die instead of one because of a technicality?
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I think what John's trying to do is right.
dialog: DEBBY
dialog: Me, too. I think it's very brave.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: Yeah, it's all very noble and brave. But what do you think Mike would want? Or your wife?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Mike is too young to know what's good for him. I'm his father. It's my job to protect him, and Denise would do the same thing if she was in my place.
dialog: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Are you saying Mike's life is more important than yours?
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Or that it's okay that Mike grows up without a father?
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: You can have more children, John.
dialog: LESTER
dialog: What happened to Mike is bad, man. It's the worst. It ain't fair, but you can't kill yourself. Sometimes you've just got to let go and let God take care of it. You've got to accept it.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Accept what?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: That Mike's going to die.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: No. I don't accept it. I reject it out of hand.
dialog: John moves over to Dr. Turner to plea his case.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you only think of Mike as a patient, but he's a great kid. Really. He's like magic, you know? He loves bodybuilding. You believe that? And he's funny. You'd like him, Doc. You'd really like him, if you knew him.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: I do like him.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Please. You've got to help him. I'm begging you. If you ever do anything outside the rules, do this. Take a chance, please.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: I'd like to. I really would. But what you're asking crosses the line. It's completely unethical.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I've crossed the line? No, you've crossed the line. The whole system has crossed the line.
text: J.Q. paces around the room, his hand on his weapon, his mood very dark and threatening.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't think you understand. I'm not letting him die. Haven't you figured that out by now? I don't care what I have to do.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: So, what, you're going to kill me if I don't operate.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: No. I'm going to kill myself.

dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: And we'll just see what happens.
dialog: LESTER
dialog: Aw, man, this is messed up.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: We all know how this works, people. In order for Mike to live, someone has to die. I'm the father. It might as well be me.
dialog: J.Q. and Turner's eyes meet. Turner doesn't speak for a long moment.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Alright.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Alright, what?
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: I'll do it. If that's what you want.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Wait a minute. Are you serious?
dialog: The room goes quiet.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Once he's dead. Why not?
dialog: Dr. Klein moves to Dr. Turner.
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: You're the finest surgeon I've ever known. You can't just throw your entire career for this man.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, you're not God. It's not up to you to decide who lives and dies.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Aw, come on, Mitch. We're all going to die.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: Not for nothing, Doctor. But if you do this, you're finished.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: So, what are they going to do? Sue me? Disbar me? Evict me from the country club?
dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: Raymond, you're under a lot of stress. You're not yourself.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: Yeah, well, what is myself? Because right now, I really don't know. Let's see --

text: I run six miles a day, drive around in my little black Porsche and date girls thirty years younger than me. Is the picture clear now? I like twelve hundred dollar shoes and I've always got a great tan. And here's the best part. Everybody kisses my ass and acts as if that's the way doctors are supposed to be, that's the reward. Reward for what? What I am is a plumber. I connect valves to tubes and tubes to valves. That's what I do. But back in that room with your son, I got a very short glimpse of my soul. And let me tell you, it's been long lost.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: But...

dialog: Come on, guys. Let's hurry it up. They could bust in here any minute.
dialog: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: This was your plan all along, wasn't it?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Last resort. You think I wanted it to turn out like this?
dialog: J.Q. pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolds it.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: This is my will. I'm leaving my heart to my son.
dialog: He holds up a pen.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: I need two witnesses. Don't everybody jump at once.
dialog: LESTER
dialog: I ain't signing your death warrant. No way.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Come on, people. The sooner we get this done, the sooner we all go home.
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'll sign.
dialog: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Me, too.
dialog: They do.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You know something, man? You're alright.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Sure am. Only one thing can stop me now.
dialog: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: What's that.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Mitch here being B-positive.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: No, sir. Type-O.Ê Swear to God.
text: For a moment the mood is light. J.Q. looks around the room at Maguire, Debby, Mitch, Julie, Lester, and the security guard. Debby can't stop crying again.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Hey, you.
dialog: MITCH
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Do yourself a favor. Start doing the right thing, huh? Life's too short. You had a good woman there. You're too smart to be so dumb.
dialog: J.Q. looks around the room before he leaves.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, people. See you in the funny papers.
scene_heading: INT. COMPUTER ROOM - SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA - NIGHT
text: The daisy wheel buzzes, pounding letters onto the print page. Mike Archibald, Hope Memorial Hospital, age 9, 85 pounds. Blood type: B-positive. MATCH.
dialog: PULL BACK TO REVEAL
text: A man sitting alone in front of the computer. He rips the copy from the printer, lays it into the fax machine and dials. A piercing beep. The paper gets sucked away.
dialog: INT. PEDIATRIC I.C.U. - NIGHT
text: A fax machine chirps in the quiet PICU. Reggie picks up the fax, and as he reads, a look of disbelief.
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: Oh, my sweet Jesus.
dialog: Paper in hand, he sprints out of the ward and down the corridor.
dialog: INT. MIKE'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: John enters to find Dr. Klein checking Mike's vitals. The heart monitor reads 30.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Can I have a word with him?
dialog: Dr. Klein exits and J.Q. moves to Mike and gently wakes him up.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Hi, Dad. You find me a heart?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Yeah, kid. We got you one. Look like you've got a guardian angel.
dialog: Mike smiles and tries to go back to sleep.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: Try to stay awake for a minute, will you? I just need to tell you a few things. I want you always to listen to your mother. Because she's your best friend and family is important.
dialog: He's all over the place, searching for the right words.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: And girls? You're too young for them now, but when the time comes, treat them like princesses because that's what they are. And if you say you'll do something, do it, because your world should be your bond. And if you have a chance to make money, go for it, even if it means selling out once in a while. Don't be a knucklehead like your father. Everything's so much easier with money.
dialog: He's stumbling, trying to cram a lifetime of advice into five minutes.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't smoke. And try to be kind. But if someone chooses you, be a man and stand up for yourself. And don't get caught up in the bad things, there's too many great things out there.
dialog: J.Q. just sits there, the tears running down his face, not knowing what to say.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: Mike?
dialog: Mike's eyes open.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Yeah, Dad?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: See you later, buddy.
dialog: Mike closes his eyes before opening and closing his little hand. Bye bye.

dialog: INTERCUT
text: Reggie races through the hospital, weaving in and out of ambulatory and pedestrian traffic. In his hand, the all important fax.
dialog: INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
text: Maguire, Klein and Turner speak in hushed tones as J.Q. reenters. When they see him, they immediately go quiet. J.Q.'s eyes are glassy, a look of finality on his face.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Let's do it.
text: Maguire gathers fresh, clean towels and makes a pack for the back of J.Q.'s head. J.Q. sits on the exam table, takes the Baretta and pops the clip. He then takes a single bullet from his pocket, feeds the clip and chambers the round.
dialog: MAGUIRE
dialog: Wait a minute. This gun was empty the whole time?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Aw, I'm all talk. I would never hurt any of you. Only person I ever considered killing was me.
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Reggie flies out the main entrance and into the crowd, pushing through the sea of humanity until he reaches Payne, Grimes and Monroe.
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: Miss Payne! You're not going to believe this! We've got a match.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: Payne studies the fax.
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: B-positive. Michael William Archibald. The only status one in the whole country. The heart is ours.
dialog: INSERT FAX
dialog: It's official. The heart is on the way.
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: Well, I'll be damned.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: You really put the kid on the list?
dialog: PAYNE
dialog: I may be a lot of things, Lieutenant, but I am not a liar.
dialog: INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: J.Q. readies himself before laying back on the roll of towels.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: John. Stop. I changed my mind. I won't do this.
dialog: J.Q. regards Turner with positive affection.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: You're a good man, Doc. I know you'll do the right thing.
dialog: J.Q. lifts the gun to his head.
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
dialog: Reggie, Grimes, Payne and Monroe run over to Denise.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Mrs. Archibald? I have some very, very good news.
dialog: INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
text: The moment has come. Everyone's face wears the intensity of it. John holds the gun up, his hand trembling. CLICK! Nothing happens.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Sorry. Safety's on.
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
dialog: Denise reads the fax.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: Is this for real?
dialog: REGGIE
dialog: You bet. The Lear Jet just landed at O'Hare. The helicopter will be here in fifteen minutes.
dialog: Grimes offers his walkie-talkie to Denise.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: You want to do the honors?
dialog: DENISE
dialog: (into walkie-talkie)
dialog: John? It's me, baby. Are you there?
dialog: INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: DENISE (O.S.)
dialog: John, honey? Pick up.
text: J.Q. hears Denise's voice squawking over the walkie-talkie. SNAP. He shuts it off. Takes a deep breath. Flips the safety off and puts the gun to his head for the final time.
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
dialog: Denise keeps triggering the walkie-talkie.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: John? John? Oh, no.
dialog: Desperate, she grabs the list and starts running towards the ER entrance.
dialog: INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: CLOSE ON J.Q.'s GUN
dialog: Moves closer to the temple til it touches.
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
dialog: Denise breaks through the police barricade.
dialog: INT. J.Q.'S TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: CLOSER ON TRIGGER as John's finger pulls it tighter.
dialog: BLAM!
scene_heading: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - E.R. ENTRANCE - NIGHT
dialog: BLAM! The sound is revealed. Not a bullet. It's Denise slapping the list up against the glass windows of the ER.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: John! It's a miracle! They found a heart! It's a miracle!!!
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: The crowd points and stares as a white medivac helicopter descends from the sky, lights flashing and lands on the roof.
dialog: PULL BACK TO REVEAL
dialog: Tuck Lampley, hand over his ear, shouting above the noise to bring us more exclusive coverage.
dialog: LAMPLEY
dialog: The heart is here. Repeat. The heart for little Mike Archibald has arrived. What an unbelievable ending to this incredible, tumultuous day.
text: A roar from the crowd is heard as the entrance to the ER is unlocked and the front door opens. Mitch and Debby are the first to emerge.
speaker_heading: LAMPLEY (CONT'D)
text: Oh my goodness, here we go. The first of the hostages are being released. Yes, they're coming out. There's one, two. They appear to be unharmed. But certainly exhausted from what must've been an excruciating ordeal.
dialog: Julie and the security guard are next. And are quickly ushered away to support vehicles.
speaker_heading: LAMPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: More, now. And there he is. John Q. is coming out.
dialog: J.Q., in baseball hat and windbreaker, emerges from the hospital.
speaker_heading: LAMPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: The suspect's hands are up. He appears to be surrendering.
text: The police are all around him now. Pointing their weapons and shouting commands. J.Q. puts his hands behind his head, turns around, kneels and then lays face down on the pavement.
speaker_heading: LAMPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: And they've got him. The police have subdued him. The handcuffs are on, and it's over. It's all over.
text: The crowd voices their disapproval with the rough way J.Q. is being apprehended. They cheer their support as he is escorted to a police car.
speaker_heading: LAMPLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: If pictures speak a thousand words, well, I'd say these images speak volumes. And now as the bloody stand off comes to an end, we remind you that Channel 8 was here first and has brought you live, moment-to-moment, all-day coverage of "Crisis at Hope Memorial.'
text: Frank Grimes takes in the whole scene. But as he glances at the suspect, a funny look comes across his face. Wait a sec -
scene_heading: INT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDORS - NIGHT
text: Mike's gurney flies through the hospital corridors. Running alongside are Turner, Klein, Maguire and Denise. As well as teams of MEDICAL PERSONNEL and a man in green surgical scrubs. As they pass a police checkpoint, we notice the identity of the man in the green scrubs. It's J.Q.
dialog: EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: As J.Q. is pushed into the car, Grimes sees his real identity. It's Lester, dressed in J.Q.'s windbreaker, collar up, baseball cap pulled way down over his eyes. Grimes shakes his head. Top notch policework. Incredulous, he turns and takes the long walk to the hospital.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM - PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY - NIGHT
text: Dr. Turner and the team work with quiet precision as Mike lays on the operating table, his chest wide open. Behind the partition glass, J.Q. and Denise hold on to each other for support as they look on. A figure in a rumpled suit settles in next to them and watches. It's Grimes.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: It's time, John.
dialog: J.Q. turns, knows it's over.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Can you give me a second, Frank? I just need to see this thing through.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Sure. Put these on for me, will you?
text: Grimes hands J.Q. a pair of handcuffs. John puts them on and the three watch the surgery. The replacement heart is taken out of its container and placed into Mike's chest. But then, something suddenly is wrong. Mike's vital signs start giving out. The gauges dropping at once. It's bad.

dialog: DR. KLEIN
dialog: He's going.
dialog: DR. TURNER
dialog: No! Come on, goddammit! I'm not losing this boy!
dialog: Nut now the long familiar tone of the EKG is heard. FLATLINE.

dialog: CLOSE ON
text: A gavel pounding down. The black-robed JUDGE silences the crowd. The courtroom is standing room only. Packed with cops, TV cameras, reporters, etc.
text: We see Denise next to a grim-faced Jimmy and Gina Palumbo. As the jury flies into the jury box, the people take their seats. The bailiff hands the verdict card to the judge who reads it before addressing the FOREMAN.

dialog: DENISE
dialog: No!
dialog: JUDGE
dialog: Quiet! Sentencing will be one week from today.
text: J.Q. stares straight ahead and takes a breath. After a moment, the public defender leads him over to the rail, where he is greeted by Jimmy, Gina, Denise and Mike.
speaker_heading: PUBLIC DEFENDER
dialog: He's going to do some time. But there's not a judge in the country that will give him more than a year. And with time served, John will be home very soon.
dialog: J.Q. leans over to talk to his son.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: You alright?
dialog: Mike nods and stands there trying to hold back the tears.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay, slugger. I'll be home soon. If you need anything, ask your mother. And Jimmy and Gina will be around.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Don't worry. If anybody messes with us, I'll take care of it.
dialog: J.Q. embraces his boy and moves over to Denise.
dialog: DENISE
dialog: A year, huh? I could have lost you forever. I guess I can live with that.

dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Time to go, John.

dialog: John? I'm proud of you.

dialog: JIMMY
dialog: Give 'em hell, Johnny. Don't worry about nothing.
dialog: MIKE
dialog: Bye, Dad.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Not goodbye. Remember? See you later.
dialog: EXT. COURTROOM - MORNING
text: An enormous crowd lines both sides of the granite steps. They cheer their support as J.Q. emerges. Grimes steers J.Q. out through the confusion as reporters stick their mics in J.Q.'s face. They ask ridiculous questions about justice, health care, and politics. J.Q., uncomfortable with all the attention, has no comment. He pushes past politely, head down, his attention joslted when he hears a familiar voice.
dialog: VOICE IN CROWD
dialog: Hey, John. Good luck, man.
text: J.Q. recognizes the voice, turns and sees LESTER. Both smile to each other as J.Q. is pushed further through when --
dialog: REPORTER
dialog: John Q.? Do you feel like your country has let you down?
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: No. It's a wonderful country.
dialog: REPORTER
dialog: I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Could you repeat that?
dialog: Grimes steps forward and speaks directly into the camera.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: He said, "America is the greatest goddamn country in the world." Now excuse us, I have to take this man to jail.
dialog: They push past the barricades and into the street.
dialog: MEDIA
dialog: John Q.! John Q.!
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Look at all this. You're a celebrity, John.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: Yeah? Check with me in a couple of days.
text: They move to the street and Grimes opens the car door. J.Q. climbs inside. He looks up to see the CROWD, in all its glory, cameras flashing, microphones pointed at J.Q.
dialog: J.Q. (CONT'D)
dialog: This is ridiculous. I don't even know these people.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: What can I tell you? You're their hero.
dialog: J.Q.
dialog: I'm not hero, Frank. I'm just a regular guy.
dialog: GRIMES
dialog: Yeah, right.
text: Grimes slams the door. The "cherry" light spins, the siren wops and the cop car rolls through the crowd of people.
dialog: INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: On the street, J.Q. sees Mike wave to him from the sidewalk, trying to get John's attention. Mike is saying something. J.Q. turns to look closer and finally he gets it: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
