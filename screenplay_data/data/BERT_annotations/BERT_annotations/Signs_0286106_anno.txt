scene_heading: INT. WINDOW - MORNING
text: We are looking out a second story window of a house. The
text: backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn
text: from use. A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a
dialog: picnic table.
text: The backyard is lined by crops. Corn. Golden and brown.
text: Six feet high.
text: Everything is perfect. Like a postcard. And then we HEAR A
text: CHILD SCREAM. IT'S FAR AWAY. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S
scene_heading: COMING FROM.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: GRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep. He thought he heard
text: something. He listens. HE HEARS THE HEATER. THE
scene_heading: REFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING. THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS
text: OUTSIDE CHIRPING.
text: Graham climbs out of bed. He moves in his pajama pants and
text: white Barron's minor league baseball T-shirt towards the
text: bedroom door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALL LANDING - MORNING
text: Graham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors
text: meet. He moves to the door that has children's drawings
text: taped to it. He puts his ear close. Listens. Beat.
text: He relaxes. Graham leans down and picks up two balled up
text: sweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor. He
text: puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his
dialog: bedroom.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
text: A bathroom door is open. WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING. WE HEAR
text: THE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED.
text: Outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded
text: outline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang. It's
text: ghostly stained forever on the blank wall.
text: A CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY.
text: The water from the sink stops. Graham steps into the
text: doorway. Toothbrush and foam in his mouth. He becomes very
dialog: still.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: The bedroom door bursts open. Graham steps into his
text: children's room. There are children's books everywhere.
text: Overflowing off shelves. Piled in corners.

text: empty.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING
text: WE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW. THEIR SCREAMS FLOAT
text: INTO A DARKENED BEDROOM OVER THE GARAGE.
text: MERRILL HESS throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings
text: onto his feet in one quick motion. He is hyper-awake.
text: Merrill is in his late twenties. He is well build. His

text: looks around bewildered.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING
text: Graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the

text: Merrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each

speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Where are they?
text: Graham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN
dialog: (yelling in the distance)
dialog: Daaaad!
text: Graham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the
text: YELLING. They look away from the house, across the yard and
text: into THE THICK WALL OF CROPS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CROPS - MORNING
text: The tall stalks of corn smack Graham and Merrill's faces as
text: they run through the crops.
text: A LITTLE GIRL appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them
text: like an apparition. She is in her nightgown. She is four.
text: They reach her fast. She stands unaware of them in a daze.
text: Her hair is messed from sleep.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Bo where's Morgan?
text: BO stands peacefully lost in her thoughts. Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Bo?

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: BOY (O.S.)
dialog: Dad!
text: Graham looks in the direction of THE BOY'S VOICE. He's

text: He finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his
text: pajama bottoms. DOGS ARE BARKING NEARBY.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Morgan what's happening?
text: Graham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of
text: Morgan. The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought.
text: Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's
text: looking straight at him.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Are... you... hurt?
text: Beat. Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I think God did it.
text: Beat. THE DOGS KEEP BARKING.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Did what Morgan?
text: Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his
text: face. Graham is forced to look to his right. Beat. Graham
text: sees something.
text: Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet. He starts moving
dialog: forward towards something.
text: He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a
text: clearing. Two German Shepherds are running back and forth.
text: They are clearly agitated.
text: Graham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING
text: FLAT ON THE GROUND. THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED
speaker_heading: FEET WIDE.
text: Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the
text: center. Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.
text: The dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL
text: THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE HESS FAMILY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF
scene_heading: THIS PERFECT, GIGANTIC CIRCLE.
scene_heading: WE KEEP PULLING BACK TO EXPOSE THIS EERIE DESIGN -- FIVE

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: ... Lee actually the reason I'm
dialog: calling is about Lionel.
text: Graham stokes the coals with a LONG BARBECUE FORK.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

dialog: done to our crops last night.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I know he's a fine boy... No one's

text: Graham steps through the back screen door into his
speaker_heading: KITCHEN.
text: Graham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED
speaker_heading: VOICE.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it
dialog: was him. You could just talk to
dialog: him and that would be enough for
dialog: me... See it was kind of strange
dialog: finding the crops like that. The
dialog: kids were... confused by it. It
dialog: would take the strangeness away if
dialog: we knew it was Lionel and the
dialog: Wolfington brothers just messing
dialog: around...
dialog: (beat, listens)
dialog: The movies...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you sure?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay, then... Thank you for your
dialog: patience Lee.
text: Graham turns off the phone. He turns to put it on the
text: counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen
text: floor with one of their two German Shepherds. There is a
text: LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Houdini peed. I think he's sick.
text: Graham looks at the majestic dog. It's shivering.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Take him outside. I'll call Dr.
dialog: Reynolds.
text: Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on
dialog: their faces.
text: Graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the
text: puddle of urine. The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his
text: knees on the kitchen floor. He leans back so he can see down
dialog: the hall.
text: A balding police officer stands on the other side of the
text: screen door.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That was quick Edgar. I only
dialog: called you boys about two hours
dialog: ago.
text: OFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
text: Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as
dialog: she put it, "diving for her life"
dialog: when a bunch of school kids rode
text: down the sidewalk on skateboards.
dialog: She went down to Thorton's store
dialog: this morning and started spitting
text: on the new skateboards. Spitting!
dialog: By the time I got there, Mrs.
dialog: Kindleman had sprayed the whole
dialog: damn place... She must have had a

text: to turn a grown man's stomach.
text: Beat. Graham stares at Officer Paski.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: So what happened to your crops?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD JUNGLE GYM - LUNCHTIME
text: Bo walks from the house with a large glass of water. She
text: moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table.
text: Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the
text: grill. He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers,
text: before walking over to Houdini.
text: The two children sit down in the grass with the dog.
text: Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl.
text: She stops. Takes a tiny sip of the water first.
text: She holds the glass out to Morgan.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: I think it's contaminated.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: You don't even know what that word
dialog: means.
text: He drinks.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: It's not contaminated. It's just
text: tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: It tastes funny.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
text: He licks his butt everyday. He's
dialog: not going to mind.
text: Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl. Beat.
text: Houdini just sits staring at them. He is not shivering. He
text: doesn't drink. He is unnaturally still.
text: Bo pushes the bowl closer.
text: HOUDINI MOVES...
text: BO'S HAND PULLS BACK...
text: HOUDINI'S JAWS SNAP SHUT IN THE AIR WHERE HER HAND USED TO
text: BE. HE WAS JUST A FRACTION OF A SECOND LATER...

speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Houdini?
text: HOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL. Bo stands up.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Bo don't run.
text: Houdini crouches down.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: What's wrong boy?
text: THE DOG'S GROWL BECOMES DEEP, MENACING.
speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CROPS - LUNCHTIME
text: Officer Edgar Paski stands facing Graham fifty feet away.

speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI

dialog: It's the strangest thing Father.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Don't call me Father.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI

speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI

scene_heading: EXT. CORN CROPS - LUNCHTIME
text: Officer Paski's knee touches the ground. He points to a

speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: (soft)
text: Look at where it's bent over.
text: Graham stands next to him and leans in. The joint where the

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's not broken.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: What kind of machine can bend a
dialog: stalk of corn over without cracking
dialog: it?
text: Graham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (softy)
dialog: Can't be by hand... It's too
dialog: perfect.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Doesn't sound much like Lionel

dialog: pants.
text: Graham, nods in agreement. Officer Paski stands up.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Second thing this week I can't
dialog: explain.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What was the first thing?
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Some animals around the county
dialog: exhibiting uncharacteristic
dialog: behavior. Sometimes violent
dialog: behavior. Theo Henry had two of
text: his fingers bit off by his cow.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Sounds like a virus.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: No Father, they're edgy. On alert.
dialog: Like they act when they smell a
text: predator around... Peeing on
dialog: themselves and everything.
text: We see a thought catch in Graham's eyes. He turns back and
text: stares in the direction of the house. You can barely see the
text: roof over the crops. Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (preoccupied)
dialog: Edgar, please don't call me Father.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME
text: Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred

text: Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and
text: Officer Paski enter the backyard. They stop cold when they
text: look in his direction. They begin a slow walk towards him.
text: Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on
text: his lap. Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently. Bo is on
text: top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball.
text: As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is

text: FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK.
dialog: Beat.

dialog: He wanted to kill Bo.

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Did he hurt you?

text: up in his arms.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers in his ear)
dialog: I'm so sorry Morgan.
text: Graham reaches up for Bo. She has dirt and tears on her
text: face. Beat. She slowly climbs down. Graham carries both
text: his children as they cry in his arms.
text: He starts towards the house. Merrill walks out from the back
text: holding a bowl of food.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: I used a little Tabasco in the
dialog: potato salad.

speaker_heading: BO

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Please tie up Isabelle to the back

dialog: nods.
text: The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: BO

text: Bo changes the channel. She finds a cartoon. She sits down
text: on the sofa.
text: Morgan and the men, can't see the screen, and move into the
speaker_heading: KITCHEN.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: How certain are you, that this was
dialog: a male?
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: I don't know any girls can run like
dialog: that.
text: Graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some
text: batteries. He hands them to Morgan.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: These are D's; I need double A's.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I have some upstairs.
text: Graham starts out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: I don't know Merrill. I've seen
dialog: some of those women on the
dialog: Olympics. They could out run me
dialog: easy.
text: They all move into the
scene_heading: FAMILY ROOM.
text: Bo watches cartoons. THE CARTOON MUSIC AND CARTOON PRAT
text: FALLS FILLS THE ROOM.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: This guy got on the roof in like a
dialog: second.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Bo, can you turn down the volume
dialog: until Officer Paski leaves?
text: Bo nods and moves to the television. The pack of men follow
dialog: Graham up the
speaker_heading: STAIRS.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: That roof is over ten feet high.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: He's telling you the truth, Edgar.
dialog: Whoever it was, is very strong and
dialog: can jump pretty high.
text: They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his
text: bedroom. He moves into his
text: BATHROOM.
text: They all move in with him.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: They got women's high jumping in
dialog: the Olympics. They got these
dialog: Scandinavian women who could jump
dialog: clean over me.
text: Graham takes the clock radio from the sink. Tries to open
dialog: the back.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Shoot, it needs a screw driver. I
dialog: have double A's in here.
text: Graham waves the radio. The men and Morgan move out of the
dialog: bathroom.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I know you're making a point Edgar.
dialog: I just don't know what it is.
text: They moves down the STAIRS.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Yesterday afternoon, an out of town
text: woman stopped by the diner and
dialog: started yelling and cussing cause
dialog: they didn't have her favorite
text: cigarettes at the vending machine.
text: Scared a couple of customers. No
dialog: one's seen her since... My point
dialog: is, we don't know anything about
dialog: the person you saw. We should just
dialog: keep all possibilities available.
text: They move through the FAMILY ROOM.
text: Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Dad, where's the remote?
text: Bo starts looking around the couch.
text: Graham stops before entering the kitchen. The group stops
text: with him. He looks at Bo searching the couch. He walks over
text: to the television.
text: There are three glasses of water on the TV set. He stands
text: next to the set. Doesn't see what's on the screen.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Bo, you're too old to still be
dialog: doing this. The rule is, you take
dialog: a glass of water, you finish it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now what's wrong with this one?
text: Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her
text: father. Looks at the glass.
speaker_heading: BO
text: There's dust in it.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: This one?
speaker_heading: BO
text: A hair.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: This one?
speaker_heading: BO
text: Morgan took a sip. It has his
text: amoebas in it.
text: Beat. Bo turns back to her search. Graham tucks the clock
text: radio under his arm and collects the three glasses. He heads
text: towards the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Excluding the possibility that a
dialog: female Scandinavian Olympian was
dialog: running around outside our house
dialog: last night, what else is a
dialog: possibility?
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: I'm not done asking questions and I
dialog: don't appreciate the sarcasm.
text: They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into
text: the KITCHEN.
text: Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other
text: half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a
text: screwdriver. He starts opening the clock radio.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Do you have anyone who might have a
dialog: grudge or something against you?
dialog: Maybe a church member, who might
dialog: not have liked the fact, that you
dialog: left the church?
text: Graham looks at Edgar.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Do you owe anybody money? You can
dialog: tell me off the record if you need
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: No.
text: Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts
dialog: replacing the batteries.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Is anything missing?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No.
text: Graham hands Morgan the monitor. He turns it ON. THERE IS A
text: STATIC CRACKLE WITH SPIKES OF SOUND.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
text: It's still making the noises. It's
dialog: broken.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's old Morgan.
text: Morgan heads out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Listen, I was out of line with that
dialog: whole female Scandinavian Olympian
dialog: thing.
text: Edgar nods.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: It's just that, I'm pretty strong
dialog: and pretty fast. And I was running
dialog: as fast as I could. And this
dialog: guy...
dialog: (embarrassed smile)
dialog: He was just toying with us.
text: Beat. Merrill walks out of the kitchen. Graham watches
dialog: Edgar think it over.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY
text: Graham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit.
text: He picks them up. Sees two more on the coffee table. He
text: gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Could everyone just take a seat on
dialog: the couch. I have some preliminary
dialog: thoughts.
text: Morgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watches
text: the TV. Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: There are three possibilities here.
dialog: We'll call them one, two and three.
dialog: The level one scenario is that
dialog: there is a sane individual, who for
dialog: real reasons wants to do you harm.
dialog: I really don't believe that's what
dialog: we're looking at here. In my
dialog: opinion, whoever this is, they
dialog: don't want to do harm to you all.
dialog: That's kind of clear.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The level two scenario is, this is
dialog: a mentally unstable person who's
dialog: fixated on you and your family.
dialog: This is a possibility, but a very
dialog: slim one.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I assure you I will treat all three
dialog: possibilities carefully, but in all
dialog: likely hood we are looking at what
dialog: we'll call a level three scenario.
dialog: He's a watcher. Someone who this
text: is a game for. He's laying low.
dialog: Doesn't want to be seen. But he
dialog: wants to watch you. Study you
dialog: folks.
text: Officer Paski walks towards the windows. Graham, Merrill and
text: Morgan follow him with their eyes. Officer Paski walks next
text: to the television.
text: ON THE SCREEN WITH THE SOUND ALMOST MUTED, IS AN AERIAL SHOT
scene_heading: FROM A HELICOPTER. A DIFFERENT ONE THAN BEFORE. THE FOOTAGE
text: IS OF A VAST FIELD OF CROPS. THERE ARE TWO DIAMONDS FLANKING
text: TWO SIDE OF A TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD.
text: Officer Paski turns to them.
text: Graham, Merrill and Morgan stare at the screen.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Now I don't want you all to worry
dialog: about this no more. You're making
dialog: more of this than it is.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You guys have had a tough couple of
dialog: days with the vandalism to the
dialog: crops and the death of your
dialog: shepherd.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe you guys should do something
dialog: fun? Let me worry about this
dialog: person. Let me find out who it is
dialog: and then -- What the hell are you
dialog: people looking at?
text: Edgar comes around to see the screen.
text: WE ARE ON A TV SCREEN. THE CROPS SWAY IN THE BREEZE.
text: A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE WAVING FROM THE DIAMONDS ON THE
speaker_heading: FIELD.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: I'll be damned.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Turn up the volume Bo.
text: Bo gets up.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: I can't find the remote.
text: She presses the up arrows on the TV controls.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR
dialog: -- images were shot yesterday
dialog: afternoon by a thirty-four year old
dialog: local camera man in Kerala, a
dialog: southern city of India. It is the
dialog: eighteenth reported crop circle
dialog: found in that country in the last
dialog: seventy-two hours.
text: The television report cuts to Columbia University PROFESSOR.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR (TV)
dialog: Crop circles first emerged in the
dialog: late seventies with the renewed
dialog: interest in extraterrestrial life.
dialog: They died out by the early
dialog: eighties; dismissed as hoaxes.
dialog: This new resurgence is wholly
dialog: different. Elements of it are
dialog: unexplainable. The speed and the
dialog: quantity in which it has appeared
dialog: implies the coordination of
dialog: hundreds of individuals over many
dialog: countries...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There is only a limited amount of
dialog: explanations. Either this is one
dialog: of the most elaborate hoaxes ever
dialog: created, or basically...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's for real.
text: Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes
dialog: in deeply.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (wonder)
dialog: Extraterrestrials.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: What in God's name is going on?
dialog: Beat.
text: THE ROOM GOES SILENT as everyone watches the images on the
text: television screen.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HESS DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: The two men walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Don't ask me what I think. Cause I
dialog: can't think straight right now.
dialog: I'm going back to the station.
dialog: Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and
dialog: try to think clear. After that I
dialog: might make some calls.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hoaxes... People got way too much
dialog: time on their hands.
text: Edgar turns back to Graham.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: But I'll tell you something, what I
dialog: said in their, still goes. You and
dialog: your family have been through a lot
dialog: in the last two days... Not to
dialog: mention what happened to you all
dialog: seven months ago.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Six months.
text: Edgar stares at Graham.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: And three weeks.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: It's left its mark still. The last
dialog: thing these children need to do, is
dialog: worry about some crazy things
dialog: happening in the world. Take them
dialog: into town. Get their minds -- your
dialog: mind, on everyday things. It's
dialog: good medicine.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's good advice...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Say hi to Marcia for me.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: You take care of yourself...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Graham.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON
text: WE MOVE THROUGH BACK ROADS OF BUCKS COUNTY. RURAL
scene_heading: PENNSYLVANIA IN ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL. TREE LINED STREETS.
scene_heading: WHITE PICKET FENCES. APPLE ORCHARDS.
text: The Hess family rides in their station wagon. Graham drives.
text: Merrill is shotgun. The children are in the back.
text: Morgan leans forward and TURNS ON THE RADIO.
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE
dialog: ... signs intended to be seen from
dialog: the sky --
text: CLICK. Graham TURNS IT OFF.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No radio either... Just for a
dialog: while.
text: Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON
text: Downtown Bucks County. A group of small stores along a quiet
dialog: street.
text: The Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking
dialog: meter.
text: Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around. Merrill
text: puts change in the meter.
text: Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Book money.
text: Morgan holds out his hand. Graham gives his son a look as he
text: reaches into his back pocket.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Only one.
text: Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand
text: and walks down the sidewalk.
text: Graham watches them turn into a store.
text: Merrill steps onto the sidewalk. Hands in his pockets as he
text: walks away.
text: Graham turns and calls after him.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Meet back in fifteen minutes.
text: Merrill waves over his shoulder. He keeps walking.
text: Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON
text: A mom and pop bookstore. Three isles wide. MR. AND MRS.
text: NATHAN, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their
text: counter and watch a black and white TV. The PICTURE ON THE
scene_heading: TELEVISION IS OF A WHEAT FIELD. THREE ENORMOUS TRIANGLES
text: SURROUND A CIRCLE.
text: Morgan steps up to the counter.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Extraterrestrials?
speaker_heading: MR. NATHAN
dialog: That's what they keep alluding to.
dialog: It's just a bunch of crock.
dialog: They're trying to sell sodas, plain
dialog: and simple. I've been watching
dialog: these reports since morning. I've
dialog: seen twelve soda commercials so
dialog: far. Twelve!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Do you have book on
dialog: extraterrestrials?
speaker_heading: MR. NATHAN
dialog: Don't tell me you believe this
dialog: horse manure?
text: Morgan shrugs. Mrs. Nathan pushes her husband aside.
speaker_heading: MRS. NATHAN
dialog: As a matter of fact, I think we
dialog: have one. Came by mistake in a
dialog: shipment. Decided to keep it for
dialog: city people.
text: Mrs. Nathan points over to the far corner.
speaker_heading: MRS. NATHAN
text: Last row. Third book from the left
dialog: honey.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PHARMACY - AFTERNOON
text: Graham waits at a white counter. A gum chewing PHARMACIST in
text: her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens,
text: glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to
dialog: the radio.
speaker_heading: RADIO HOST (V.O.)
dialog: Why is no one saying the obvious?
dialog: This is just a rash case of
text: copycats. Someone, somewhere, does
text: the first one. It's on TV, it's on
text: the internet. In less than an hour
dialog: a couple hundred people get the
dialog: same brilliant idea and here we
dialog: are... on the verge of mass
dialog: hysteria.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: It was asthma medicine right
dialog: Father?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: For Morgan Hess. And it's not
dialog: Father anymore.
text: The Pharmacist looks back at Graham and then reaches up and
text: TURNS OFF THE RADIO. She quietly finds the prescription on
text: the shelf and moves to the counter across from Graham.
text: She doesn't ring it up. She just stands there fiddling with
text: the bag holding Morgan's medicine. Beat.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Can I ask you a favor Father?
text: Graham stares at the girl. Beat. He nods "yes."
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Can I take confession with you?
text: Beat. Graham leans forward on the counter and takes the
text: girl's hands in his. He talks very slowly.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Tracey, I -- am -- not -- a --
dialog: reverend -- anymore. I haven't
dialog: been for six months. You know
dialog: this.
text: Beat. When Tracey speaks her VOICE IS A BIT SHAKY.
speaker_heading: TRACEY
dialog: All this stuff on TV...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Joe Gills was in here talking about
dialog: the end of the world... I'm just a
dialog: little scared.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Please. I need to take confession
dialog: with you.
text: Graham looks at the young girl's teary eyes. He exhales
dialog: slowly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ARMY RECRUITING OFFICE - AFTERNOON
text: Merrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an Army
text: uniform standing at attention on a beach.
text: We are in a narrow ARMY RECRUITING CENTER. Inside the small
text: storefront space is a desk. A gentleman sporting a CREWCUT
text: sits behind it.
text: A young man, Merrill's age, sits at a side card table filling
dialog: out some forms.
speaker_heading: CREWCUT GUY
dialog: I got it figured.
text: Merrill realizes the crewcut guy is talking to him.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: CREWCUT GUY
dialog: I've had two separate folks tell me
dialog: they think there are strangers
dialog: around these parts the last couple
dialog: of nights. Can't tell what they
dialog: look like, cause they're staying in
dialog: the shadows -- covert like. No
dialog: one's got hurt mind you... And
dialog: that's the give away.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (doesn't see)
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: CREWCUT GUY
dialog: It's called probing. It's a
dialog: military procedure. You send a
dialog: reconnaissance group, very small,
dialog: to check out things. Not to
dialog: engage, but to evaluate the
dialog: situation. Evaluate the level of
dialog: danger. Make sure things are all
dialog: clear...
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Clear for what?
text: The crewcut guy savors the beat of silence.
speaker_heading: CREWCUT GUY
dialog: ... For the rest of them.
text: It takes a second, but Merrill smiles. The crewcut guy
text: smiles back. Merrill points at a poster.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: You have a pamphlet or something I
dialog: can read?
text: The crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures. Picks the
text: top brochure and hands it to Merrill.
text: The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely.
speaker_heading: CREWCUT GUY
dialog: Hey you didn't used to play
dialog: baseball did you?
text: Merrill looks up from the brochure. Beat.
speaker_heading: CREWCUT GUY
dialog: Shit. I know you. You're Merrill
dialog: Hess. I was there that day you hit
dialog: that five hundred and eighty seven
text: footer over the left field wall and
dialog: set the record. That thing had a
dialog: motor on it... It's still the
dialog: record right?
dialog: Merrill not, "yes."
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (soft)
dialog: I got the bat at home... On the
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: CREWCUT GUY
dialog: You got two minor league home run
dialog: records don't you?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Five. The five longest.
speaker_heading: CREWCUT GUY
dialog: Boy, why aren't you in the pros
dialog: making stacks of cash and getting
dialog: handfuls of T and A?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Cause he also has the minor league
dialog: strike out record.
text: Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at
text: the folding table.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Hello Lionel.
text: LIONEL smirks.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: He'd just swing as hard as he could
dialog: every time. It didn't matter what
dialog: the coach said, didn't matter who
dialog: was on base, he'd whip that bat
text: through the air as hard as he
dialog: could... Looked like a lumber jack
text: chopping down a tree.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Merrill here, struck out more times
dialog: than any two players.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CREWCUT GUY
dialog: You really hold the strike out
dialog: record?
text: Beat. Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket. Looks like
text: he's not going to say anything. When he does, the words are
dialog: soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Felt wrong not to swing.
text: Beat. The crewcut guy shakes his head. Merrill turns and
text: starts walking.
text: As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in
text: Lionel's direction, like he might hit him. Lionel flinches
text: and covers his face.
text: Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PHARMACY - AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: I cursed thirty-seven times last
dialog: week... I said the f-word a couple
dialog: times, but mostly "shits" and
dialog: "bastards."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is "Douche bag" a curse?
text: Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the
dialog: counter.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I suppose it's in its usage.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: How about "John you're a douche bag
dialog: for kissing Barbara?"
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That's a curse.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: Then it's not thirty-seven. It's
dialog: seventy-one.
text: Graham's eyes widen.
speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: I stole a bottle of Ruby red lip
dialog: stick from K-mart... I punched my

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON
text: Bo sits at a tiny reading table and drinks a glass of water.
text: There is another glass, half-full, on her table. Mrs. Nathan

text: Beat. Bo looks up with a grimace.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: It's contaminated.
text: MRS. NATHAN YELLS TO MR. NATHAN AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE.
speaker_heading: MRS. NATHAN
dialog: Carl, there's something wrong with
dialog: our water!
text: Morgan doesn't look up from the extraterrestrial book.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Your water is fine. Bo has a thing
dialog: about her drinking water. She's
dialog: had it her whole life. Like a tick
dialog: people have. Except it's not a
dialog: tick.
speaker_heading: MRS. NATHAN
dialog: (fascinated)
dialog: Is that right?
text: Bo shrugs. She places the glass she sipped on the table with
text: the other glass.
text: Mrs. Nathan stares at the four-year old.
speaker_heading: MR. NATHAN (O.S.)
dialog: Thirteen!
text: Everyone turns to the front of the store where Mr. Nathan
text: points to the TV screen. A Coke Cola commercial is on.
text: Beat. Mrs. Nathan turns back to find Morgan holding out the
dialog: extraterrestrial book to her.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I'll take it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON
text: Merrill, Morgan and Bo are waiting in the parked car. Beat.

speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Pharmacy crowded?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I don't want any one of you
text: spending time with Tracey Abernathy
dialog: alone. Is that understood?
text: Beat. Everyone nods, "yes."
text: Graham puts the key in the ignition and turns the car on.
text: Merrill watches as Graham's hand goes to put the car in
text: reverse -- and then stops.
text: Graham is staring out the windshield. Merrill follows his
text: stare to a thin, thirty-year old man in a LEATHER JACKET
text: coming out of a store. Merrill's face changes expression
text: too. They both stare as the man passes in front of the car.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Is that him?
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Everyone in the car watches the man in the leather jacket as
text: he steps off the sidewalk towards the truck. It's here that
text: he notices the stares. He glances up to see the faces
text: watching him from the station wagon.
text: The leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck. He gets
text: in, turns it on, and without looking over to the station
text: wagon, backs out of the parking lot.
text: Beat. The Hess family sits quietly.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Who is he?
text: Nobody says anything for the longest time.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: He's the man who killed mom.
text: Graham puts the station wagon in reverse and backs out into

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HESS HOME - AFTERNOON
text: THE SKY IS GOLDEN RED. The crops sway hypnotically in a

text: one gets out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON
text: All four sit quietly not getting out.
text: A MUFFLED SPIKE OF NOISE IS HEARD FROM THE BACK SEAT.

text: out of his jacket. He holds it in his lap.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: What if Bo's baby monitor is
dialog: picking up signals from the
dialog: extraterrestrials?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: All this crop stuff. They did it
dialog: twenty-five years ago. It was a
dialog: joke.
text: THE MONITOR SPIKES WITH A SUDDEN CRACKLE. MORGAN PULLS IT
text: AWAY FROM HIS EAR.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's just static Morgan. Turn it
dialog: up and see.
text: Morgan turns a knob on the side.
text: THE VOLUME SUDDENLY JUMPS UP ON THE MONITOR. WE HEAR BEEPS
text: IN THE STATIC. THE RED LIGHTS ON THE FRONT OF THE BABY
text: MONITOR LIGHT UP WITH EACH BEEP.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: It's a code.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Let me see that please.
text: Morgan hands Graham the monitor in the front seat. THE BEEPS
text: COME AND GO AS THEY GET COVERED BY THE STATIC.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: It's noise.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's broken Morgan. It'll just
dialog: keep doing this.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let's get out of the car okay?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: We might lose the signal.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We can't just sit in the car in our
dialog: own driveway like this.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: We'll look like mental patients.
text: Beat. Nobody gets out of the station wagon.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'm getting out now.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Don't do it.
text: Graham pulls the handle. His door opens. He waits before
text: getting out. The other three station wagon doors open right
dialog: after.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE CAR
text: Graham stands and closes his driver side door.
text: THE MONITOR CHANGES SOUNDS. THE BEEPING DISAPPEARS. THE
scene_heading: STATIC BECOMES LOUDER, BECOMING A MOVING, SWIRLING SOUND
text: TEXTURE.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Nobody move!
text: Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon.
text: Three of the doors are open.
text: IN THE TEXTURE OF SOUND, JUST FOR A MOMENT, WE HEAR SOMETHING
text: THAT SOUNDS LIKE...
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Voices. Did you hear that?
text: Everyone stares at the baby monitor in Graham's hand.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Not English though. You heard the
dialog: voices right Uncle Merrill?
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: I heard them Morgan.
text: Graham doesn't move his arm. He keeps it out in the air
text: where he had it as he closed his door. Graham looks to
text: Merrill over the roof of the station wagon.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's probably picking up another
dialog: baby monitor.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: That's right.
text: THE SWIRLING TEXTURE SOUND FLOATS THROUGH THE AIR ABOVE THE
scene_heading: STATION WAGON.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Let me see it.
text: Beat. Graham moves. He hands the monitor over the hood.
text: Merrill reaches for it.
text: THE SWIRLING, MOVING TEXTURE BECOMES LOUD AND FILLED WITH
scene_heading: UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Stop!
text: Graham and Merrill freeze -- both touching the monitor over
text: the roof of the station wagon.
text: WE HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VOICE EMERGE AND THEN
text: QUICKLY FADE AWAY.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
text: It doesn't sound like words.
text: Merrill concentrates on THE SWIRLING MOVING TEXTURE COMING
text: FROM THE BABY MONITOR.
text: Graham looks around at his rapt family.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: See this is why we're not watching
dialog: those news reports. People get
dialog: obsessed.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm letting go now.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: No dad!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Don't do it!
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: You'll lose the signal!
text: Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them. Beat.
text: Morgan is the first one to move.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Don't let go.
text: He moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper
text: where he begins to climb onto the station wagon.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Morgan?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: It gets clearer, the higher you
dialog: hold it.
text: Morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so
text: gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Morgan, be careful.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: I got him.
text: Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof.
text: Merrill keeps a hand on his nephew. Morgan raises the
text: monitor above his head.
text: THE RED LIGHTS ON THE BABY MONITOR ALL TURN ON.
text: THE SWIRLING TEXTURE COMING FROM THE MONITOR BECOMES
scene_heading: SOMETHING MORE MECHANICAL, LIKE THE HUM OF LARGE EQUIPMENT IN
text: THE DISTANCE.
text: THE VOICE LIKE SOUNDS ARE UNDER A CRACKLE BUT ARE CLEARER AND
speaker_heading: LOUDER.
text: Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Hold on.
text: Graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood. He takes
text: hold of Bo. All four are on the car now.
text: Morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon. Merrill
text: holds him by the waist.
text: Bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over Graham and
text: the windshield. Graham boosts her up over his head with both
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Merrill you got her.
text: Merrill reaches out his free hand. Bo reaches out to him.
text: THE SOUND FROM THE MONITOR SUDDENLY CHANGES.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Stop!
text: Everyone STOPS exactly where they are. Graham holds Bo over
text: his head. Bo reaches out to Merrill. Merrill sits on the
text: roof with one arm out. Morgan stands with the baby monitor
text: raised high in the air. The Hess family remains very still
text: on the hood of their station wagon as they listen.
text: THE CRACKLING IS GONE. THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE CLEAR AND
text: UPFRONT. THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT TONES IN THE MIX.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (soft)
text: There's two of them talking.
text: THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE NOT WORDS BUT MORE LIKE GRUNTS AND
text: GURGLING LIKE SOMEONE DROWNING. THE SOUNDS ARE BEING CREATED
text: BY INHALES, NOT EXHALES. A SEQUENCE OF THESE SOUNDS IN ONE
text: TONE IS FOLLOWED BY SILENCE AND THEN THE SECOND TONE BEGINS
scene_heading: ANOTHER SEQUENCE LIKE A CONVERSATION.
text: Graham struggles to hold Bo up. Bo struggles to keep her
text: arms out. Merrill struggles not to turn his face to the
text: incredible SOUNDS ABOVE HIS HEAD.
text: THE TONES ESCALATE IN VOLUME.
text: Morgan's eyes widen as THE SEQUENCE OF SOUNDS BECOMES SHORTER
scene_heading: AND FASTER. THE TONES BECOME HARDER, ANGRIER. THE SILENCES
text: ALMOST GONE.
scene_heading: THE VOICE-LIKE TONES REACH A LOUD FEVERISH PACE, ALMOST
text: VIOLENT AND THEN WE HEAR A CLICK AND THEY'RE GONE.
text: Beat. Everyone looks up at the baby monitor. The red lights
text: are off. ONLY THE BLAND HUM OF NORMAL STATIC COMES FROM IT'S
text: SPEAKER.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (soft)
dialog: They hung up.
text: Graham brings Bo down into his lap. Morgan takes a seat next
text: to Merrill on the roof. The Hess family sits like mental
text: patients on the top of their station wagon.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING
text: WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE CROPS LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE.
text: The LIGHTS are on in the kitchen. We see Graham, Merrill and
text: the children doing dishes after dinner.
text: The DOG IS BARKING FURIOUSLY.
text: OUR VIEW TURNS TO LOOK AT THE BARN THROUGH THE CROPS.
text: Isabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a post
text: outside the barn. The dog whips back and forth frantically.
text: She keeps looking in our direction.
text: WE HEAR A SCREEN DOOR OPEN. WE TURN TO LOOK BACK AT THE
text: HOUSE. Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of
text: dog food and a bowl of water.
text: We watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog. When he
text: gets close, Graham slows. He approaches the dog carefully.
text: He places the two bowls close but not too close. The dog has
text: no interest in them. She keeps barking and glaring in our
dialog: direction.
text: Graham watches her for a few moments, and THEN TURNS AND
text: LOOKS DIRECTLY AT US FROM ACROSS THE YARD.
text: WE PULL BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE CROPS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BARN - EVENING
text: Graham stands frozen looking across his yard. Isabelle, the
text: dog turns in desperate circles behind him. Graham's eyes
text: stay focused on the same point in the darkness. He talks to
dialog: no one.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You know something? Even
dialog: entertaining the possibility of
dialog: this for a minute has been
dialog: exciting.
text: Beat. Graham starts to move.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I can see how people can get
dialog: carried away with this type of
dialog: thing.
text: Graham reaches the barbecue area. There's a flashlight on
text: the picnic table. Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON. A NARROW
text: BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM.
text: Graham starts toward the crops.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's a kind of faith. It's an
dialog: intoxicating thing to believe in
dialog: something you can't see.
text: THE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE
text: BACKYARD. Graham steps right up to them. He hesitates and
text: then steps into the field of
speaker_heading: CORN CROPS.
text: We can't see two feet in any direction. Six foot stalks of
text: corn line Graham on all sides. THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A
text: WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You were always good at that...
text: THE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH. Graham
text: starts following it. His shoulders brush crops on either
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Believing in things you couldn't
dialog: see.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You would have been the first
dialog: person on that station wagon
dialog: wouldn't you? You and Morgan would
dialog: have been wrestling for that baby
dialog: monitor.
text: SOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD.
text: Graham stops. HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH. Nothing
text: but crops disappearing into darkness.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It'll be secretly kind of sad for
dialog: everybody, when this turns out to
dialog: be -- all just make believe.
text: THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. Graham spins and aims
text: the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT. THE LIGHT ONLY
text: PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: You're wasting your time here! I'm
dialog: not going to report this or
dialog: anything you do to me crops, to the
dialog: news or TV or anybody! You're not
dialog: going to get famous!
text: Beat. There is no response. GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN
text: BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF
speaker_heading: HIM.
text: Beat. Graham holds his breath. THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE
text: BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM.
text: Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time. THE
text: BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND.
text: GRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW. HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
text: BREATHING. BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. HIS OWN BREATHING IS
text: FAST AND LOUD NOW.
text: Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness. His hands
text: search over the ground in all directions. They finally touch
text: the flashlight. Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the
dialog: "on" button. He does.
text: A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND. SOMETHING POWDERY
text: WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY.
text: It instantly moves into the darkness. Graham tries to get
text: up. He stumbles backwards into the crops. He's tangled in
text: crops as he struggles to rise. He gets up and starts
dialog: running.
text: Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions. He panics.
text: He doesn't know where he is. THERE IS SOMETHING COMING
speaker_heading: BEHIND HIM.
text: Graham makes a sudden right turn. He puts his hands in front
text: of him to protect his face and eyes. He's running as fast as
text: he can. HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM.
text: Another sudden turn, this time left. Graham emerges into his
scene_heading: BACKYARD.
text: Graham keeps running across the yard. ISABELLE BARKS
scene_heading: FRANTICALLY.
text: When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns.
text: There is no one behind him. The wall of crops fifty feet
text: away sway in the gentle night breeze.
text: Graham gains control of his breathing. He turns and walks to
text: the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
text: Graham steps into the kitchen. His hair is messed. His
text: shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it. He
text: locks the back door.
text: The children don't notice his presence. They're splashing
text: each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes.
text: Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room.
text: He sees Merrill there.
text: Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN
text: BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace. Merrill doesn't
dialog: notice him either.
text: Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes
text: a seat. His breathing is a slow controlled pant. He runs
text: one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and
text: thinks. His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows
dialog: his mind. Beat.
text: Merrill is the first to notice him. He moves from where the
text: baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen. As he passes the
text: children at the sink, he turns off the faucet.
text: The children stop playing and look up to Merrill. They
text: follow his stare to the kitchen table.
text: Beat. Graham looks up at them.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let's turn on the TV.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - EVENING
text: THE TV GOES ON WITH A CLICK. THE SCREEN BLOWS WHITE AND THEN
scene_heading: IMMEDIATELY DARKNESS. OUTLINES AND SHAPES EMERGE.
text: THE SOUND POPS ON.
speaker_heading: TV REPORTER
dialog: -- first appeared fifty two minutes
dialog: ago.
text: THE SCREEN FILLS WITH CRISP BLACKS. WE ARE WATCHING VIDEO OF
text: A NIGHT SKY OVER A DENSE CITY. THE THOUSAND LIGHTS OF THE
text: CITY FILL THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAKING IMAGE.
text: ANOTHER SET OF LIGHTS DOT THE SKY ABOVE THE CITY. THEY ARE
scene_heading: ARRANGED IN TWO "V'S" SIDE BY SIDE.
text: Bo puts her finger to the screen and counts the hovering
dialog: lights.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Fourteen.
text: Morgan, Merrill and Graham stand silently before the
text: television set.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR
dialog: Mexico City officials as well as
dialog: U.S. officials have confirmed that
dialog: these are not air crafts from
dialog: either government's airforce. The
dialog: first sighting was made by an Air
dialog: Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan
dialog: to New York as the unidentified
dialog: crafts entered Mexico City air
dialog: space. They were not detected by
dialog: radar by either country.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: The crazies were right.
text: Beat. Everyone just watches the fourteen lights hovering on
dialog: the screen.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: We have to tape this...
text: Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the
text: television stand. He grabs one.
text: Bo snatches the video as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: My ballet recital.
text: Morgan stares at his sister.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (gravely serious)
dialog: Listen Bo. This is very important.
dialog: Everything people have written
dialog: about in science books is going to
dialog: change. The history of the world's
dialog: future is on the TV right now. We
dialog: need to record this so you can show
dialog: your children this tape and say you
dialog: were there...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: For your children Bo.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: My ballet recital.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Dad!
text: Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (preoccupied)
dialog: Find another tape.
text: Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa.
text: They both have the same dazed, slow movements.
text: Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically. He
text: finds one and reaches for the VCR.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.
text: Morgan slams the tape marked "Bay Watch" into the VCR and
text: presses record. He's breathing heavy now. Wheezing
dialog: actually.
text: Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his
text: father and his uncle. Bo walks over and squeezes in also.
text: The four of them stare at the television.
speaker_heading: TV ANCHOR
dialog: ... You're seeing a live feed from
dialog: our NBC affiliate down in Mexico
text: City. The time there is 7:17pm.
dialog: This image has not been adjusted or
dialog: enhanced in any way. What you're
dialog: seeing is real.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Everything they wrote in science
text: books is about to change.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Told you.
text: Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - MIDNIGHT
text: The family room lights are off now. The TV is still on. The
text: SOUND IS MUTED. There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on
text: the television now.
text: The fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen. Morgan
text: is asleep on Graham's lap. Bo is asleep on Merrill's
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Some people are probably thinking
dialog: this is the end of the world.
text: Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: That's true.
text: Merrill looks his brother in the eyes. Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Do you think it's a possibility?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: How can you say that?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: That wasn't the answer you wanted?
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Can you at least pretend to be like
dialog: you used to be? Give me some
dialog: comfort?
text: Beat. Graham thinks it over.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: ... There are all different ways
dialog: you can tell that there's someone
dialog: really there watching out for us.
dialog: You see signs. Sometimes they're
dialog: little ones. You think of someone.
text: The phone rings. They're on the
dialog: phone... Sometimes they're big,
text: like fourteen lights hovering over
dialog: Mexico City.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sure, there are a lot of people
dialog: watching this who think this could
dialog: be a bad thing. But there are a
dialog: lot of people watching this, who
dialog: think it's a miracle. A sign of
dialog: God's existence. It's all in how
dialog: you look at things Merrill.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What you have to decide is what
dialog: kind of person you are? Are you
dialog: the type who believes in miracles
dialog: and looks for signs or are you the
dialog: kind who believes, things just
dialog: happen by chance?
text: Beat. Merrill is deep in thought.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: I was at this party once. I'm on a
dialog: couch with Sara Mckinney. She was
text: just sitting there, looking
text: beautiful and staring at me. I go
dialog: to lean in and kiss her and I
dialog: realize I have gum in my mouth. I
dialog: turn and take out the gum. Stuff
text: it in my paper cup next to the sofa
text: and turn around. Sara Mckinney
text: throws up all over herself.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I knew the second it happened. It
dialog: was a miracle. I could have been
text: kissing her when she threw up.
dialog: That would have scarred me for
dialog: life. I may never have recovered.
text: Merrill looks at the TV screen. Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: I'm a miracle man. Those lights
dialog: are a miracle.
text: Graham smiles.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: There you go.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: So which type are you?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Do you feel comforted?
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: What does it matter then?
text: The two of them turn back to the silent screen of the
text: television. It's a long beat before Graham speaks.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Do you know what Colleen's last
dialog: words were before they killed her?
text: Beat. Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: She said, "See", and then her eyes
dialog: glazed a bit and she said... "Tell
dialog: Merrill to swing away."
text: Merrill's mouth opens a bit. Graham turns and chuckles at
text: his expression.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Do you know why she said that?
dialog: Merrill nods, "No."
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Because the nerve endings in her
text: brain were firing as she died, and
dialog: some random memory of us at one of
dialog: your baseball games popped into her
dialog: head.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There is no one watching out for us
dialog: Merrill. We're all on our own.
text: Graham turns back to the television. Beat.
text: THE LIGHT OF THE TELEVISION FLICKERS ON THE FACES OF THE TWO
text: BROTHERS AS THEY SIT WATCHING IN SILENCE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY
text: Graham's eyes open. DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room. He is
text: alone on the couch. Alone in the room.
text: He looks to the television. It's not there.
text: Graham moves to his feet and look around the room. His eyes
text: stop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in the
text: family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door.
text: Graham moves to the door. WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES.
dialog: Graham opens the
speaker_heading: CLOSET.
text: Merrill looks up. He's seated on a kitchen chair with the
text: television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: For the kids protection. All they
dialog: were doing was watching TV from
dialog: five a.m. I felt like they were
dialog: getting obsessed like you said.
dialog: They should be playing furry, furry
dialog: rabbit or tea party or something
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What's furry, furry rabbit?
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (points)
dialog: That's a game isn't it?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Anyway...
dialog: (points at the TV)
dialog: There's been some interesting
dialog: developments.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: Eleven a.m. They're gone.
text: Beat. Graham looks at the TV screen. There's a daylight
text: shot of Mexico City. The skies are empty above it.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: But they're not really gone. We
dialog: just can't see them. Early this
dialog: morning a bird flew right at the
text: area where the lights were hovering
dialog: last night.
text: Merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: It stopped dead in the air and fell
dialog: straight down.
text: Merrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: They caught it on tape and they've
dialog: been playing it all morning. They
text: found the bird. His head crushed
dialog: in. When you see the footage it
text: looks like the bird flew into a
text: wall in the sky.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They think they have some invisible
text: shield thing going, like an optical
dialog: illusion.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: The bird could have had a heart
dialog: attack and crushed his head when he
dialog: fell.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: Already thought of. Two other
dialog: birds did the same thing an hour
dialog: later. Not as dramatic. They
dialog: lived. But you could see they hit
dialog: something.
text: Graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: They're still there hovering. In
dialog: fact, some people think there's
text: more of them now. All over the
dialog: place. Over us even.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And there's a theory about the crop
dialog: circles now. They think it could
dialog: be some kind of landmark, visual
dialog: mapping system -- so they can
dialog: navigate. Coordinate. Makes sense
dialog: doesn't it?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
text: We are inside Graham's bedroom facing his bathroom door,
text: which is closed. The same sun-faded outline of where a large
text: cross used to hang, is stained on the wall next to the door.
text: Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair.
text: He towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window.
text: WE LOOK OUT THE SAME WINDOW WE LOOKED OUT AT THE VERY
scene_heading: BEGINNING.
text: The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym. A
text: single tree throws shade onto a picnic table. The back of
text: the yard is lined by corn crops. Golden and brown. Six feet
dialog: high.
text: The crops go on well beyond our view. Graham stares at them
text: quietly. Watching.
text: Beat. THE SOUND OF WHISPERING DRAWS HIS ATTENTION FROM THE
speaker_heading: WINDOW.
text: He listens closely. HIS CHILDREN ARE WHISPERING IN THE NEXT
speaker_heading: ROOM.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Graham walks into the hall and looks in their room.
text: Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed. They have
text: TIN FOIL wrapped around their heads like a helmet. Graham
text: stares at his children.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: So the aliens can't read our minds.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: They tell you everything in this
dialog: book.
text: Morgan holds up the book he bought from Nathan's bookstore.
text: Graham enters the room. The children make space for him on
text: the bed. He takes a seat between them. Morgan puts the book
text: on his father's lap.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: It says they're probably very small
dialog: -- like my height -- because, as
dialog: their brains developed, there was
dialog: no use for physical development.
dialog: It says they're probably
dialog: vegetarians, because they would
dialog: have realized the benefits of such
dialog: a diet.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Who wrote this book?
text: Graham looks on the back cover for a picture. There's none
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Scientists who have been persecuted
dialog: for their beliefs.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That means they're unemployed.
text: Morgan closes the book.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Dad, are you going to be serious?
text: Bo points at the book.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Yeah, serious.
text: Graham looks at his two children with foil on their heads.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I don't know what got into me.
text: Beat. Morgan puts the book on his father's lap.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
text: There are pictures.
text: Beat. Morgan opens the tome.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of
dialog: the book --
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Bimboo?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Dad.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I just asked his name.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: You had a tone.
text: Beat. Graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a
dialog: tone.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: He says there are two reasons why
dialog: Extraterrestrials would visit us.
text: Morgan turns the page.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: To make contact in the spirit of
dialog: exploration and furthering the
dialog: knowledge of the universe.
text: Graham looks at an illustration of a small, bulbous headed
text: figure shaking hands with a bearded human.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Or the other reason... They're
dialog: hostile. They've used up the
dialog: resources on their planet and are
dialog: looking to harvest our planet next.
text: Morgan turns the page. There is a picture of a house. A
text: space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at
dialog: it. Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Looks a little like our house
dialog: doesn't it?
text: Morgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture. Beat.
speaker_heading: BO
text: The same windows.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (soft)
dialog: That's weird.
text: The three of them study the picture of the house. It's on
text: fire. Their eyes move to the front yard. There are three
text: bodies lying dead on the front lawn. Two are children.
text: THE PHONE RINGS.
text: The children SCREAM and cling to their father. THEIR SCREAMS
text: DIE DOWN. The PHONE RINGS again. Graham gets up. He closes
dialog: the book.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for
dialog: now. Everybody in this house needs
dialog: to calm down and eat some fruit or
dialog: something.
text: Graham steps out into the hallway. He tucks the book under
text: his arm and picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: Father.
text: THROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL
text: AGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Hello?
text: NOTHING BUT DEAD AIR. Graham looks at the receiver and then
text: slowly hangs it up.
text: Graham walks down the hall to a small window.
text: The window looks down the driveway and out onto the road.
text: Graham stares into the distance. About a half-mile away we
text: see the TIP OF A HOUSE. Graham gazes at it for a beat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL - DAY
text: Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on. He moves
text: to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it.
text: Merrill looks up from the television.

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Hello Ray.
text: RAY REDDY doesn't look over. Doesn't react. Keeps staring.

speaker_heading: RAY

text: Graham sits up. He's only four feet away from the pantry
text: door. He looks around not knowing what to do. His eyes fall
text: on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer
text: onto the floor.
text: He takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to
text: the door. Beat. He reaches with the butcher knife
text: underneath the slanted kitchen table. He uses the knife like
text: a mirror to see under the door. Graham watches the SOFT
text: REFLECTION IN THE FLAT STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE OF THE BLADE.
text: WE CAN MAKE OUT BROKEN GLASS AND RIPPED OPEN PACKETS OF RICE
text: AND CEREAL ON THE GROUND. THERE ARE POCKETS OF SHADOWS WE

text: from the door. Beat.
text: He takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the

text: He stops halfway down. He loses his nerve and sits up. He
text: rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the
text: counter. Graham starts walking across the kitchen. He gets
text: to the door. Puts his hand on the doorknob.
text: He stays like that for a long time. Beat.
text: Graham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly
text: across the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He
text: kneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the
text: slanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor,
text: only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the
text: pantry.
text: There is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of
dialog: the pantry. Nothing else.
text: Graham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR. Something's wrong.

speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Yes. They would invade us using
dialog: only ground tactics. Hand to hand
dialog: combat. They wouldn't use their
dialog: technology or fight an airborne

dialog: would eventually use nuclear
dialog: weapons and the planet would be

speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: I'm sorry, what book is this?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Did they say what our chances would

speaker_heading: MORGAN

dialog: with full forces hundreds or even

speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: MORGAN

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

text: OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied. She is
text: not pacing. She is not barking. She sits staring right at
text: us. She is shivering.
text: OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill
text: carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs.
text: He's moving into the main house.
text: Merrill walks across the yard. His eyes look around
text: carefully as he moves.
text: Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses
text: the lawn. He stops walking and starts to gather up the
text: fallen things. He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs
text: encased in glass cases.
text: The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has
text: cracked. He takes the ball out. Stares at it.
text: We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of
text: clothes and things on the grass. He looks around and finds
text: what he's looking for. A rake.
text: Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle.
text: With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball
text: in the other, he turns to face the crops.
text: WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS. PART OF OUR VIEW IS
text: OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.
text: Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a
text: batter's stance. His left leg digs into the grass in front
text: of him. His weight is mostly on his back leg. He looks out
text: into the distance high over the crops. He throws the
text: baseball up in the air...
text: Merrill grabs the wooden handle. Merrill's shoulders move
text: with blinding speed. The wooden rake handle slices the air.
text: And misses the ball.
text: The ball drops at Merrill's feet.
text: WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again. This
text: time his shoulders move even faster. The wooden stick
text: actually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.
text: The ball drops at Merrill's feet.
text: WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up
text: and tries a third time. This time he YELLS as he swings. He
text: rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the
dialog: eye.
text: The baseball drops at his feet. Strike three.
text: Merrill stands still in the yard. He's breathing a little
text: heavy as he stares down at the ball.
text: He gently picks it up. He walks back to his pile of things
text: and then suddenly turns. He throws the ball in the air as he
text: does. His left leg goes out. His weight goes to his right
text: leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and
dialog: power...
text: THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS
text: ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.
text: The ball rockets into the air. We watch it fly overhead...
text: sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.
text: After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth. It
text: lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air. It
dialog: cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops. Maybe
dialog: more.
text: WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard. He drops
text: the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things. He

dialog: door.
text: The sink is piled with pots and pans. It seems like every
text: utensil and dish in the kitchen was used.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINNING ROOM - EVENING
text: One side of the dinning room is lined with windows that have
text: been boarded up.
text: The table is set. Mash potatoes, spaghetti, French toast,
text: chicken teriyaki and bacon cheeseburgers are all displayed
text: elegantly on serving dishes.
text: The Hess family sits around the table. Beat. The scene is
text: somber. No one is moving.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What's the matter with everyone?
dialog: Eat.
text: No one says anything. No one eats.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I'm scared.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I don't want to hear anymore talk
dialog: like that. And I don't want to see
dialog: anymore faces like the ones I'm
text: looking at.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We are going to enjoy this meal.
dialog: Nothing can stop us from enjoying
dialog: this meal! Enjoy!
text: Bo sits next to her three glasses of water and begins to cry.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Stop crying!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: Don't yell at her!
text: Morgan's face is hard, but tears start to fall anyway.
text: Graham watches as both his children cry at the table.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Fine, if you all don't want to eat,
dialog: then I'm going to have some of
dialog: everything.
text: Graham takes big scoops of every dish and piles it on his
text: plate. He digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it
text: in his mouth. He swallows.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: This tastes so great.
text: Bo, Morgan and Merrill watch in stunned silence as Graham
text: stuffs more in his mouth. He chews and chews and swallows
text: hard. He digs his fork into the pile again.
text: Graham starts crying as he eats. He keeps taking more bites.
text: More tears fall.
text: Morgan gets up from his seat. He goes to Graham's chair. He
text: leans against his dad's arm and cries with him. Graham's
text: fork stops moving. He watches as Bo moves from her seat to
text: his other side. She holds her dad's arm and cries.
text: Beat. Graham pulls them both up onto the chair with him and
text: hugs them tight. Merrill leans forward and comes to the pile
text: on Graham's chair. Merrill buries his head in Graham's
text: shoulder. The Hess family huddles together at one end of the
dialog: table. Beat.
text: THE BABY MONITOR EXPLODES WITH STATIC AND NOISE.
text: Everyone slowly turns and looks over to Morgan's place
text: setting where the baby monitor sits on the table. THE RED
text: LIGHTS ON THE FRONT ARE ALL LIT UP.
text: Merrill sits up. Graham puts down the children from his lap.
text: He gets up from his seat and moves around the table and out
text: of the dinning room. He moves through the family room and
text: into the hall.
text: Graham opens the closet door and looks in at the television.
text: He turns it ON.
text: Beat. THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYMBOL IS ON THE SCREEN. A
text: LOW TONE EMITS FROM THE TV. Beat. Graham changes stations.
scene_heading: THE SYMBOL AND TONE APPEAR ON EVERY CHANNEL. THE MONOTONE
text: SOUND FILLS THE CLOSET. Beat.
text: Graham steps out into the hall. Merrill and the two children
text: are standing there waiting. Graham looks at them.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: It's happening.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING
text: Merrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards
text: to the children's bedroom door. The master bedroom door is
text: open with a board leaning next to it. Graham is inside his
dialog: bedroom
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Graham walks to the window next to his bed. It's the same
dialog: one we've looked out twice before.
text: Graham looks out onto his backyard. The FLOOD LIGHT FROM THE
text: HOUSE THROWS LONG SHADOWS OVER THE YARD. There is a light
dialog: breeze. Nothing seems wrong.
text: Graham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on
text: into darkness. He moves closer to the glass. Watches the
text: top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind.
text: SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS.
text: Graham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black
text: forty feet away. Graham goes very still.
text: LINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE
text: TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD. WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S MAKING THEM.
text: ALL WE SEE ARE THE COUNTLESS LINES BEING FORMED. THE LINES
text: MOVE FROM THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE HOUSE. GRAHAM WATCHES
text: THEM CLOSE IN ON HIS BACKYARD. THIRTY FEET... TWENTY FEET...
dialog: TEN...
text: Graham backs away from the window towards the middle of his
dialog: bedroom.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Graham hurry.
text: Graham turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in
text: the hall. Graham moves out into the hall and shuts the
text: bedroom door behind him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING
text: Merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts
text: hammering nails into the frame. Graham picks up his hammer
text: and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood.
text: Graham glances to his right as he works. Bo and Morgan are
text: standing together at the top of the stairs. Bo holds
text: Morgan's hand.
text: Graham keeps hammering as he speaks.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Did I ever tell you what everyone
dialog: said when you were born, Bo?
text: Bo nods "no" lightly.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You came out of your momma and you
dialog: didn't even cry. You just opened
dialog: your eyes and looked around at
dialog: everybody. Your eyes were so big
dialog: and gorgeous, the ladies in the
dialog: room gasped.
text: Graham stops hammering. Merrill keeps going.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: They literally gasped.
dialog: (Graham gasps like them)
dialog: Then they go, "She's like an
dialog: angel." They said, "We've never
dialog: seen a baby so beautiful."
text: Graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment. Merrill
text: finishes hammering.
text: Graham goes over and picks up Bo.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: And you know what else happened?
dialog: Bo nods, "no."
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: When they put you on the table to
dialog: clean you up, you looked at me and
dialog: smiled. They say babies that young
dialog: can't smile... You smiled.
text: Graham looks at his daughter quietly. He brushes the hair
text: out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up.
text: All four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Let's go down now.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL - EVENING
text: Graham puts Bo down in the hallway. She stands close to him.
text: Merrill puts down Morgan. The four of them stand quietly in
text: a tight group.
text: THEY HEAR FRANTIC BARKING IN THE DISTANCE.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: We forgot about Isabelle.
text: ISABELLE'S BARKING BECOMES DESPERATE AND ANGRY. THEY LISTEN
text: AS SHE BARKS NONSTOP FOR TEN SECONDS... AND THEN SUDDENLY
speaker_heading: STOPS.
text: THE LOW EMERGENCY TONE FROM THE CLOSET TV FILLS THE SILENCE.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Should we turn off the lights?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: They already know we're here.
text: THE FIRST SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT ARE HEARD OUTSIDE. CREAKS OF
text: WOOD FROM THE FRONT PORCH CAN BE HEARD.
text: THERE IS SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT FROM BEHIND THE LOCKED BACK DOOR.
text: SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE. SOUNDS
text: FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.
text: THERE IS SCRATCHING NOISES AGAINST THE FRONT DOOR. METAL
text: NOISES AS THE HANDLE IS TRIED.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (almost inaudible)
dialog: Dad --
text: THE DOOR CREAKS AS PRESSURE IS PLACED AGAINST IT.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Do you know what happened when you
dialog: were born Morgan?
text: Morgan looks at his father, unable to speak.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You came out and your momma kept
dialog: bleeding. The doctors rushed you
dialog: out of the room before I could even
dialog: see you.
text: THERE ARE THUDS ABOVE THEM.
text: All four look up.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: They're on the roof.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: While they were trying to fix her
dialog: up, all she kept asking about was
dialog: you.
text: THEY LISTEN AS THE THUDS INCREASE IN NUMBER.
text: THE FIRST SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS IS HEARD FROM UPSTAIRS.
text: Merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: They're in the house.
text: Graham takes Morgan's hand.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I wanted your momma to see you
dialog: first. She had dreamed about you
dialog: her whole life.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They waited till she felt better,
dialog: then they brought you in. They
dialog: placed you right in her arms. And
dialog: she looked at you. And you looked
dialog: at her. You just stared at each
dialog: other for the longest time and then
dialog: she said real soft, "Hello Morgan,
dialog: I'm you momma, you look just like I
dialog: dreamed."
text: Graham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back.
text: SCRATCHING NOISES BEGIN TO COME FROM UPSTAIRS.
text: The group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs.
text: The BEDROOM DOOR HANDLES ARE BEING RATTLED.
text: Merrill's eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors, to the
text: ceiling of the upstairs hallway. He stares at a rectangle in
text: the ceiling. A tiny rope hangs from the rectangle. Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: The attic door.
text: Merrill sprints up the stairs.
text: Morgan and Bo watch as Graham follows after Merrill.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING
text: Graham and Merrill stare up at the ceiling. There is
text: movement right above them. Dust falls from a ceiling light
text: right next to them.
text: The rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them.
text: They watch as it begins to twitch and sway.
text: The springs in the trap door begins to GROAN. The door
text: starts to fall open.
text: Merrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and
text: reach up. The door opens a few inches. Merrill is taller.
text: The door presses against his fingers first. It gives a few
text: more inches before Merrill stops it.
text: Graham's finger are barely touching it. Merrill's face turns
text: red with strain as something pushes down on the door.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: This is a very temporary solution.
text: Graham brings his arms down. He sees his children watching
text: from the bottom of the stairs. Graham looks around where he
text: is. There is a very small table with photos against a wall.
text: A laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors...
text: nothing else. Graham turns to Merrill.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: How temporary?
text: Merrill's face is a deep crimson.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: Twenty-two seconds.
text: Graham looks around again... the same things... the same
text: table... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the
text: closet. It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed
text: on a guide rail. The wooden folding door is very tall. Its
text: top is one foot from the ceiling.
text: Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door. He starts
text: rocking it hard. Pulling it out... It starts to come out of
text: its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight...
text: The thin wooden door rips out of place. One end is still
text: attached at the hinge. Graham pulls it straight. It reaches
text: into the middle of the landing. It stands right next to
text: Merrill. Right under the attic trapdoor. Its top is only a
text: few inches lower than Merrill's reach.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Let go.
text: Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor. It
text: connects with the top of the closet door and stops. The
text: trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of
text: the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to
dialog: the attic.
text: Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds
text: the weight of the attic door.
text: After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as
text: the pressure is let up. The trapdoor closes. Beat.
text: It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet
text: door with a THUD.
text: The attic trapdoor closes again. Opens again with force.
speaker_heading: THUD.
text: The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges
text: keeping it upright.
text: Graham moves down the stairs. Merrill follows him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL - EVENING
text: THE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE.
text: Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach
text: under the front door. THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO
text: THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON
speaker_heading: THE DOOR.
text: THUD. THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR
speaker_heading: UPSTAIRS.
text: Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall. Graham takes
text: Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the
text: hall. Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the
dialog: stairs.
text: ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
text: The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he
text: enters the kitchen.
text: Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and
text: waits by it. Merrill goes over and the two of them push the
text: table against the swinging door.
text: They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and
text: jam the rest underneath the table.
text: Graham leans against the kitchen counter. Merrill stares at
text: the pile of furniture.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: This is going to do nothing.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We have to go in the basement.
text: Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a
text: darkened door at the bottom.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: There's no way out of there.
text: Beat. Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Did I ever tell you, I dislocated
dialog: Uncle Merrill's arm?
speaker_heading: THUD.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Should we make a run for it out the
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: They're right behind the door.
text: Merrill looks at the boarded up back door. Graham turns to
text: Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: He was only a year and half old.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (to Graham)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: He was trying to eat a second
dialog: chocolate bar. Your grandma said,
text: "No." He tried to take a bite, so
dialog: I grabbed it.
text: THUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS. Merrill turns and
text: stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I must have pulled his arm at an
text: awkward angle. His elbow popped
text: right out of the socket.
text: THE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING. THE
text: CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS
speaker_heading: HALL.
text: WE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: He didn't scream or anything. His
text: arm just flopped to his side and he
dialog: got real still.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: They're coming.
text: Graham moves towards the basement stairs.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: I held him in my lap in the back
text: seat as we drove to the hospital.
dialog: I couldn't stop crying... We need
dialog: to go into the basement now.
text: Graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs. Morgan
text: and Bo move to their father slowly.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You know what your Uncle Merrill
dialog: did right after the doctor put his
text: arm back in place? He jumped off
text: the table and gave me a hug. He
dialog: had already forgotten that I was
dialog: the one who hurt him.
text: Graham ushers the two children down the stairs. He waits for
text: Merrill. Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks
text: toward him. Merrill stops and looks down the stairs.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: We won't be able to get out of
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
text: Beat. Merrill's eyes fill with water. He doesn't look up at
dialog: his older brother.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: I know.
text: Merrill walks down the stairs. Graham waits at the top. He
text: watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against
dialog: it. Beat.
text: THERE IS MOVEMENT OUTSIDE IN THE HALL.
text: The door starts to force its way open. THE TABLE AND CHAIRS
text: BEGIN TO SCRAPE ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE NAILS AGAINST A
scene_heading: CHALK BOARD.
scene_heading: WE HEAR VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ENTER THE KITCHEN. SOUNDS MADE
text: FROM INHALES, NOT EXHALES.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - EVENING
text: Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: We forgot our foil helmets!
text: Graham closes the door behind him. It has no lock.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We need something to wedge against
text: the doorknob.
text: The basement is lined with metal shelves. The shelves are
text: cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords,
dialog: cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools. Merrill
text: rummages through the shelves frantically.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: They'll read our minds!
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You're scaring your sister.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: I'm already scared.
text: Graham puts his ear to the door and listens.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Merrill --
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: I'm looking!
text: Merrill moves to another set of shelves. He starts knocking
text: things to the ground.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: They'll know our secret thoughts.
text: There is SCRATCHING AGAINST THE DOOR. The doorknob turns.
text: Graham grabs it with both hands. The door begins to push
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Merrill!
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Got it!
text: Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a
text: pick for digging in the ground. He holds it up in the air.
text: It has a three-foot wooden handle.
text: Merrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction.
text: A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling. It is
text: the only light in the room. Merrill CLIPS THE LIGHT BULB
text: with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room.
text: THE BULB SHATTERS.
text: THE BASEMENT IS INSTANTLY BLACK.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: Dad!
text: WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF SUDDEN COMMOTION, VOICES. STRUGGLING
text: AT THE DOOR. STEPS ON BROKEN GLASS.
text: CLICK. A BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT COMES ON.
text: IT ILLUMINATES MORGAN STANDING NEXT TO A RACK OF METAL
text: SHELVES. HE TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT IN HIS TINY HANDS.
text: THE NARROW BEAM MOVES ACROSS THE DARKNESS. IT FINDS MERRILL
text: AND GRAHAM LEANING UP AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR.
text: MORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED
text: BETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND. THE PICK WAVERS A
text: LITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS.
text: THE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO
speaker_heading: LESSEN.
text: Beat. Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S
speaker_heading: FACE.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Where's Bo?
text: THE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS. THROUGH THE BOXES,
text: BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING
scene_heading: BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD. BO'S
text: HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS. SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT.
speaker_heading: BO
dialog: I'm okay.
text: ANOTHER BEAM COMES ON. IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES
text: WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT. HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE
text: SHELVES NEAR HIM. BEAT.
text: HIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO.
text: He turns the knob to "on." The radio lights up, but no sound
text: emerges for it's speakers. Merrill turns the channel knob
text: and checks all the stations. No sound. No signal. He
text: listens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: What's happening out there?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (in the dark)
dialog: I can't even imagine.
text: THEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: I hope they're doing better than we
dialog: are. We don't even have helmets.
text: THERE IS A LOUD BANG.
text: BOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME
text: TO A STOP ON THE DOOR.
text: ANOTHER BANG. THE DOOR VIBRATES. THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN
text: HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE.
speaker_heading: BANG.
text: GRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS. He looks at the door
text: and then turns and faces the lights.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: They're just making noises.
text: They're not trying to get in.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why are they doing that?
text: Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness. Morgan
text: moves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: They want our attention on the
dialog: door?
text: BANG. A beat of silence.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: They're distracting us?
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: From what?
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: The book says they're probably very
dialog: good problem solvers.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: What book!
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: They'll find a way in.
speaker_heading: BANG.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Morgan, give me your flashlight.
text: Morgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS
text: THE FLOOR. THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN
text: GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.
text: THE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM. He picks it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Is there an air vent in here?
text: Merrill moves next to Graham. ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR.
text: They aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM. The
text: brothers move in opposite directions.
text: GRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE
text: CEILING AS HE MOVES.
text: MERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME. HIS FLASHLIGHT
text: PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS.
text: A BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR.
text: Merrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I can feel air.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Me too.
text: THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: It's getting stronger.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: I'm close.
speaker_heading: BANG.
text: THE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL. GRAHAM AND
scene_heading: MERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME
text: TO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN.
text: HE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL. HE STARES UP AT THE
scene_heading: TWO LIGHTS.
speaker_heading: MORGAN
dialog: What?
text: IN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM
text: A BREEZE.
text: GRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR
text: VENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST.
text: EYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT. A NARROW SET
text: OF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN
scene_heading: THE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN.
text: MORGAN SCREAMS. THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND. THERE'S
text: A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE. FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT.
text: WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.
speaker_heading: MERRILL (O.S.)
dialog: Hold the vent!
text: SOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT. WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING
scene_heading: FACES. MORGAN SCREAMING.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Pull him!
text: THE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN. WE SEE IT IS
text: BO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT.
text: BO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT. MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE
text: THERE. HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG
text: FOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL. HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER
text: WITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG. HE QUICKLY
text: MOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT.
text: BO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM. SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN
text: ENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT. HE HEAVES IT ON TOP
text: OF THE PILE. HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN. RETURNS WITH
text: ANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR. GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF
text: THE REST.
text: MERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED. THE PILE OF DOG FOOD
text: AND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT. A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS
text: ON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL. HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS
text: AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE.
text: Merrill slowly catches his breath. He reaches over to his
text: side and grabs the remaining flashlight. HE TRAINS THE BEAM
text: AROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN.
text: HE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP. MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS
scene_heading: BACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST. USING HIM AS A CHAIR. MORGAN'S
text: FACE IS PALE. HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES. IT SOUNDS
text: LIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW. HE'S SUFFOCATING.
text: GRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: We don't have his medicine.
text: Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray.
text: Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the
text: child's ear.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Don't be scared Morgan. We'll slow
text: it down together. Feel my chest.
dialog: Feel it going in and out. Breathe
dialog: like me. Breathe like me.
text: Morgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain
dialog: and panic.
speaker_heading: BO
text: He can't breathe.
text: Bo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch.
text: Graham closes his eyes. Beat. He opens his eyes and talks
text: into Morgan's ear.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Stay with me. Stay with me. I
dialog: know it hurts. Be strong baby...
dialog: It'll pass.
text: Graham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Don't do this to me again. Not
dialog: again.
text: Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face.
text: Graham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on
text: Graham's hand. The fingers squeeze with all the strength
dialog: they have.
text: Graham looks to Merrill helplessly. Merrill's eyes fill up
dialog: with water.
text: Graham's eyes close.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I hate you. I hate you...
text: Graham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: The fear is feeding it... Don't be
dialog: afraid of what's happening...
dialog: Believe it's going to pass...
dialog: Believe it... Just wait... Don't be
dialog: afraid... The air is coming...
dialog: Believe... We don't have to be
dialog: afraid... It's about to pass...
dialog: Here it comes... Don't be afraid...
dialog: Here comes the air...
text: A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT. LIKE THE
text: SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: There we go... We don't have to be
dialog: scared at all... We know it'll
dialog: pass. We believe it... Don't be
text: afraid Morgan.
text: Morgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand.
text: THE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR

text: Merrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his
dialog: son.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Feel my chest... Breathe with me.
dialog: Together... The air is going in our
dialog: lungs... Together... We're the
dialog: same. We're the same.
text: Merrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with
dialog: Graham's.
text: THE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO
text: LABORED BREATHS.
text: Graham's eyes close. He starts crying. He speaks to no one.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: I hate you.
text: Morgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand. Merrill watches as
text: father and son breathe together. Merrill and Bo hold each
dialog: other tight.
text: THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED
text: FACES. THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE
text: BASEMENT. TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS. THEY'RE BOTH LOST
text: IN THEIR THOUGHTS.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: I should save the flashlights.
text: Beat. Graham nods without looking over.
text: MERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT. THE BEAM OF
scene_heading: LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT. THEY
text: DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS.
text: Merrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in
text: her hand. THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE
text: HER AND MERRILL.
text: Merrill nods to her. She reaches down and presses the
dialog: button.
text: THE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - MORNING
text: WE ARE STILL IN BLACK. A VOICE IS HEARD IN THE DARKNESS.
text: IT'S MURKY AT FIRST, THEN BECOMES CLEARER.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: ... Jordan, Saudi Arabia and
dialog: Bahrain have also confirmed.
text: Graham opens his eyes from sleep. HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT
text: OF THE HANGING BULB IN THE BASEMENT.
text: Merrill steps into his vision.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: I found a pack of light bulbs.
text: Merrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf. THE
text: VOICE WE HEARD IN THE DARKNESS COMES FROM THE TINY SPEAKER OF
text: THE RADIO.
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE
dialog: ... Parts of China and Northern
dialog: Korea are among the few remaining
dialog: to verify withdrawals.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: They're broadcasting...
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: It came on about two hours ago.
dialog: Woke me up.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We won Graham.
text: Merrill waits for his brother to say something. Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: It went on all night. Everywhere.
dialog: It was completely a ground battle.
dialog: Mostly hand to hand. You can't see
dialog: them unless you're up close. A lot
dialog: of people died. Some from combat.
dialog: But most from poison gas
text: inhalation. They secrete it.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: How many died?
speaker_heading: MERRILL
text: They think over a hundred thousand.
dialog: They're just estimates.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But we held strong.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: How do they know it's over?
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: A mass evacuation by them started
dialog: about eight o'clock this morning.
text: It's eleven now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They're leaving.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: You didn't think we'd make it.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (low voice)
dialog: Listen, there's things I can take
dialog: and a couple things I can't and one
dialog: of them I can't take, is when my
dialog: older brother --
dialog: (voice cracks)
dialog: -- who is everything I want to be,
dialog: starts losing faith in things. I
dialog: saw your eyes last night.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't want to ever see your eyes
dialog: like that again, okay? I'm
dialog: serious.
text: Merrill's face is hard. He looks shaken. Graham stares at
text: the conviction in his younger brother's expression.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: Beat.
text: THERE'S A WHEEZING SOUND FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM. Graham
text: and Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on
text: Merrill's folded sweater. Morgan's breathing is strained.
text: He still looks grey.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: He's been like that for awhile. We
dialog: need to get him some medicine.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Have they said anything about our
dialog: area?
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: Philadelphia and its outlying
dialog: counties are cleared, but who knows
dialog: for sure?
text: Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground. Graham
text: turns to Merrill.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: He's not strong enough to fight off
dialog: another attack.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We need to be sure, before we open
dialog: that door Graham.
text: The two men stand under the single dangling light bulb.
text: Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan. He moves across
text: the room towards him.
text: Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's
text: side. Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt.
text: Graham walks back to Merrill. He holds it out between them.
dialog: Beat.
text: He turns it ON.
text: A SLIGHT STATIC IS HEARD. GRAHAM TURNS THE VOLUME ALL THE
text: WAY UP. THE STATIC GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE.
text: THERE ARE NO NOISES, NO SPIKES, NO VOICES... JUST EMPTY
scene_heading: ELECTRICAL STATIC. Beat.
text: Graham makes eye contact with Merrill. Beat.
speaker_heading: MERRILL
dialog: That's good enough for me.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT STAIRWELL - MORNING
text: DAYLIGHT FILTERS DOWN FROM THE KITCHEN AND PIERCES THE
text: STAIRWELL TO THE BASEMENT.
text: The basement door cracks open a few inches. Beat. Merrill
text: opens it all the way.
text: DUST FLOATS UP IN THE DAYLIGHT THAT SPILLS DOWN THE STAIRS.
text: Merrill moves up the stairs by himself. He reaches the top
text: and looks around. Turns back down to the faces at the
text: bottom. Gives them the thumbs up.
text: Graham leads Bo up the stairs. He carries a limp Morgan in
text: his arms.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: THE KITCHEN IS KIND OF BEAUTIFUL IN ITS DESTRUCTION. BEAMS
text: OF DAYLIGHT CRISSCROSS THE ROOM FROM THE PUNCHED OUT HOLES IN
text: THE WINDOWS AND BOARDS.
text: THE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.
text: WE HEAR SOUNDS FROM THE TV FILTERING IN FROM THE HALL.
text: Graham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the
text: toppled chairs to get to the cabinets.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Get the syringe as well. We might
dialog: need to give him an epinephrine
dialog: shot.
text: Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - MORNING
text: SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT STREAM IN FROM ONE SIDE OF THE FAMILY ROOM
text: WHERE THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN IN.
text: Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa.
text: WE HEAR CHEERING COME FROM THE TELEVISION, FILTER THROUGH THE
text: FRONT HALL AND INTO THE FAMILY ROOM.
text: Bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room.
speaker_heading: BO
text: People are dancing.
text: She points at the closet.
text: Morgan strains to look in her direction. Graham looks at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You want to see it?
text: Morgan nods, "yes" as he struggles to breathe.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'll bring the TV in here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CLOSET - MORNING
text: THE TELEVISION SHOWS A SHOT OF A STREET CORNER. THOUSANDS OF
scene_heading: PEOPLE STAND IN THE STREETS. A REPORTER STANDS AMONGST THEM
text: AND TALKS INTO A MICROPHONE.
speaker_heading: TV REPORTER
dialog: Today there are no countries, and
dialog: no races, and no differences -- we
dialog: are all apart of the same --
text: Graham unplugs the television. The screen goes black.
text: Bo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and
text: the television cart out into the hall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - MORNING
text: Graham pulls the television into the family room. Careful
dialog: not to trip it on the carpet.
text: THE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR.
text: Graham moves the television into position. THE BLACK SCREEN
text: REFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS.
text: THE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE
scene_heading: TELEVISION SCREEN.
text: The TV stops moving. Graham stays frozen with his hands on
text: either side of the television cart. He's slightly bent over.
text: His back is to the family room.
text: Graham straightens and turns around slowly.
text: Morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air. Morgan's
text: face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up.
text: For a moment it appears he's suspended in the air. Then we
text: see the outlines... and we see the eyes. The black eyes.
text: There is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the
text: middle of the family room. It's powdery skin has taken on
text: the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly,
text: it almost disappears.
text: It blinks.
text: Graham and Bo have turned to stone. Bo stands frozen in the
text: front hall.
text: Merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the
text: family room. He takes two steps into the room and comes to a
text: stop next to the fireplace. The inhaler and syringe in his
text: hand fall to the ground. The creature is between Graham and
text: Merrill in the middle of the family room.
text: Morgan is dying. THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT.
text: The lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the
text: creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand.
text: Graham's eyes shift to the hand. THREE OF THE CREATURES
text: FINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE.
text: The creature's hand moves to Morgan's face. It tilts its
text: fingers and palm back. THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY
text: CHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM.
text: A small pore opens up on its wrist. A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS
text: TO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING.
text: Graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of
text: the creature. It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's.
text: GRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS
text: TO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM.
text: GRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES.
text: WE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN. WE SEE THE EMOTION
text: IN THEM. HIS MOUTH BARELY GETS THE WORDS OUT.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: He's reading my --
text: THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUND OVERWHELMS EVERYTHING. THE
text: ROOM GOES BRIGHT WHITE.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: WE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT. THE LIGHT IS MOVING. WE
text: REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE
text: OF THE ROAD.
text: The car door opens. Graham Hess steps out. His coat is
text: open. He is wearing a black shirt and black pants. A
text: priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black
text: shirt. Graham looks around in a daze.
text: We are on a country road. THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE
text: LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR. Four police cars are scattered
text: amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.
text: A large group of officers and workers hover around a green
text: truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.
text: Officer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham. He whispers
text: something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he
text: approaches. Edgar looks badly shaken. Beat. The two men
text: look at each other.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: What do you know?
text: Graham stands motionless with his hands at his sides. Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: There was an accident. Drunk
dialog: driving. They weren't sure.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: He wasn't drinking. Ray fell
text: asleep at the wheel.
text: Officer Paski gestures in the direction of one of the
text: ambulances. Ray Reddy sits to the side on the grass. His
text: arms rest on his bent knees.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Is he okay?
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Yes... That's the first thing
dialog: Colleen asked too.
text: Graham smiles a little smile.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: She's talking... Which ambulance is
dialog: she in?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
text: She's not in an ambulance Father.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
text: See Father, Ray's truck swerved off
dialog: the road and ah... Hit Colleen and
text: then a tree. She was pinned
dialog: between the two.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Pinned? What does that mean?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: The truck... the truck has severed
text: most of her lower half.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: She won't be saved. At this point
text: she's alive, because the truck is
text: holding her together. She doesn't
text: feel much, and she's talking almost
dialog: like normal. We didn't pull the
dialog: truck out, cause we wanted you to
dialog: come down here to be with her, as
dialog: long as she's awake. That won't be
dialog: very long.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Father, you understand what I've
dialog: told you?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Edgar.
dialog: (he starts crying)
dialog: Is this the last time I'm going to
dialog: talk to my wife?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PASKI
dialog: Yes it is.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: The other officers turn and look as Graham walks by them. He
text: walks on, unaware of the stares.
text: He slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck. It
text: sticks out onto the road a few feet. He comes around the
text: side of the vehicle.
text: COLLEEN HESS is beautiful in a delicate way. Her straight
text: brown hair falls down over her small face. She leans over
text: the front bumper of the truck onto the hood. Her head rests
text: on her arms like a child resting on a school desk. Her back
text: is against a tree. The lower half of her is obscured by the
dialog: truck.
text: She's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up
text: to her. She is shivering slightly.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Hi sweetie.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Hi baby.
text: Graham glances down. There are bundles of blood soaked
text: blankets in the area below her. They peek out under the
text: twisted front of the truck. Graham looks up quickly.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I was just taking a walk before
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: You love walks.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I guess it was meant to be.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Does it hurt?
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: I don't feel much.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Good.
text: Graham touches her cheek. She starts crying. Graham starts
text: crying with her.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: (crying)
dialog: ... Tell Morgan to play games --
dialog: it's okay to be silly.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (crying)
dialog: ... I will.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: (crying)
dialog: ... Tell Bo to listen to her
dialog: brother. He'll always take care of
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (crying)
dialog: ... I will.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: (crying)
dialog: ... Tell Graham --
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (crying)
dialog: I'm here.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
text: Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand. She rests
text: on it. Her eyes are distant.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: (soft)
dialog: And tell Merrill to swing away.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: What?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Colleen?... Colleen?
text: WE ARE OVERCOME BY A BRIGHT WHITE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - MORNING
text: WE ARE IN THE FAMILY ROOM. THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS
text: FADE AND ARE REPLACED BY THE BREATHING IN THE ROOM.
text: THE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS IT'S BEING
speaker_heading: RELEASED.
text: THE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGAN'S UNCONSCIOUS
speaker_heading: FACE.
text: THE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN
text: WINDOWS. THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM
text: AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT. THINGS ON SHELVES, THINGS ON
text: TABLES, THINGS ON THE WALL.
text: Graham stares at the baseball bat on the wall. Beat.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Swing away, Merrill.
text: Morgan's face is obscured by gas.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (loud)
dialog: Merrill.
text: Merrill turns and looks to Graham.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Swing away.
text: Graham's eyes are not on Merrill. Merrill follows his eye
text: line to the baseball bat mounted above him.
text: Beat. Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting
dialog: place.
text: The creature starts to move.
text: Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks
text: forward. He stops. His weight shifts to his right leg.
text: The creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its
text: lines and colors don't match in position in the room.
text: Merrill's left leg goes out. His torso and shoulders turn
text: with staggering speed and strength. The bat slices through
text: the air of the family room... Contact.
text: The creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball
dialog: bat.
text: Morgan is dropped. He falls to the carpet of the family room
text: in an unnatural crumpled pile. His arms and legs flop
text: lifelessly to the carpet.
text: The creature turns to face Merrill. All the creature sees is
text: the BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack. SLAM.
text: The creature falls to the ground.
text: Graham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan. Graham
text: picks up his son's limp body in his arms.
text: The creature moves to its feet.
text: Merrill's hands choke up on the bat. Merrill's eyes are on
dialog: fire.
text: Graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine
text: on the ground.
text: Merrill SCREAMS as he swings again. His powerful muscles
text: pull his shoulders whipping around. The bat connects with
text: the creature across its chest. The creature is thrown back
text: into the wall. Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH
text: ONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER. The water connects with it's
text: skin. The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND.
text: Bo and Graham look up.
text: THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS
text: INTO A POWDERY WHITE.
text: Merrill looks back across the room at Bo and Graham. They

text: Merrill looks around at Bo's half-filled water glasses places
text: all over the family room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - MORNING
text: Merrill steps in. THE WOODEN BAT MAKES A SOUND AS IT CUTS
text: THROUGH THE AIR. SLAM! It connects with the creature. The
text: creature falls back into the coffee table. Bo's glasses of
text: water crack and SPLASH OVER the creature's TORSO. ANOTHER
text: HIGH PITCHED INHALE SCREAM. His torso turns a powdery white.
text: Parts of its body are still changing and matching its
text: environment. Parts are white.
text: The creature stands again.
text: Merrill looks for the next target in the room. Bo points to
text: the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon

dialog: nods.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FAMILY ROOM - MORNING
text: MERRILL YELLS WITH EVERYTHING IN HIS LUNGS. His wrists turn.

text: THE CREATURE. PIECES OF WOOD SPLINTER OVER THE FAMILY ROOM.
text: THE CREATURE WAVERS AND THEN ALL SEVEN FEET OF IT TIPS OVER.
text: IT FALLS BACK. IT CLIPS THE TV STAND AS IT FALLS. IT LANDS
text: ON THE GROUND WITH A THUD.
text: THE CREATURE'S BLACK, EMPTY EYES LOOK UP IN TIME TO SEE BO'S
text: GLASSES OF WATER RESTING ON THE TELEVISION, FALL... AND SPILL
text: OVER THE EDGE -- RIGHT ONTO ITS FACE.
text: THE CREATURE'S SCREAMS FILL THE FAMILY ROOM -- AND THEN
scene_heading: SUDDENLY STOP.
scene_heading: IT BECOMES VERY STILL. EVERY INCH OF ITS BODY TURNS A

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: His lungs were closed.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: His lungs were closed. No poison
dialog: got in... No poison got in.

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
