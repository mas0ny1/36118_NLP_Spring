scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT
text: START ON THE FACE of A GOLDEN CAT STATUE. This is the cat-
text: god BAST, lithe, noble, beautiful. CAMERA MOVES to reveal
text: the statue is 50 feet tall, dominating this space. Other
text: images of CATS -- hieroglyphics, ceramics -- abound, as do --
text: REAL CATS, hundreds of them, slinking in the shadows on ramps
text: cut into the sandstone walls of this Egyptian temple.
text: At Bast's feet, EIGHT ACOLYTES in GOWNS kneel in a semi-
text: circle around a flaming BRAZIER. Some of the women WEEP,
text: others PRAY or stare stoically ahead. From outside, we now
text: hear DISTANT SCREAMS, the sounds of MARAUDERS. There's a
text: RHYTHMIC BANGING at the massive BRONZE TEMPLE DOORS.
scene_heading: EXT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT
text: THE TEMPLE is an impressive place of worship -- tapered
text: columns and an ornate Egyptian facade -- at the apex of a
text: hilltop VILLAGE, in FLAMES, under ATTACK by a PERSIAN ARMY.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: "496 B.C."
text: WHAM! THE STEEL PRONG of a mounted BATTERING RAM swings into
text: the ornate DOORS of the temple. PERSIAN SOLDIERS operate the
text: brutal siege engine, SLAM the doors again and again.
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT
text: The HIGH PRIESTESS wears a special HOODED WHITE GOWN that
text: mostly conceals her face. She moves from one ACOLYTE to the
text: next, pours a DARK LIQUID from a bejeweled decanter into
text: golden goblets, then pours one for herself. She raises her
text: goblet toward BAST, as do the others -- they drink in unison.
text: HIGH ANGLE as the GOBLETS CLATTER to the floor and the WOMEN
text: SLUMP to the ground... dead. PULL BACK -- we're watching
text: this from the PERSPECTIVE of an EGYPTIAN MAU CAT -- slim,
text: elegant, dark-spotted gray and black fur, a SCARAB MARK on
dialog: its head.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: THE MAU lets out a CRY... which prompts an eerie, growing
text: CHORUS of MEOWS and HOWLS from the other CATS.
text: THE CATS emerge from the hiding places en masse, leaping from
text: niches, converging on the bodies. The MAU leads the way,
text: moves to the high priestess and puts its mouth to hers...
text: ON THE TEMPLE DOORS - at last they BUCKLE and swing open.
text: THE SOLDIERS, bearing TORCHES and SWORDS, storm inside. They
dialog: grab anything of value, SMASH and DEFACE everything else.
text: At the foot of BAST lie nine ROBES... but there's no sign of
text: the women who wore them. SOLDIERS slash the robes with their
text: swords anyway, then snatch up the goblets for booty.
text: An unearthly CRY -- half-human, half-feline -- from somewhere
text: high above the rampaging soldiers. They freeze, looking
text: around frantically. More EERIE CRIES echo off the walls,
text: from all directions. The SOLDIERS raise their weapons,
text: clustering defensively. From out of the shadows above them,
text: DARK HUMAN FORMS suddenly leap down with impossible agility.
text: STAY ON THE FACE OF BAST, peering down impassively. The
text: torch-cast SHADOWS of the violence below play upon the
text: statue's golden surface... FLAILING SWORDS, the swift
text: SILHOUETTES of NAKED WOMEN. We hear the GUTTURAL CRIES of
text: the soldiers, clearly outmatched in this mortal combat.
text: MOVE TO THE CATS, perched above the fray, looking downward as
text: they pace the temple's ledges and ramps excitedly. THE MAU
text: takes a final look at its handiwork, then leaps up, slinks
text: through a crevice at the roof, and emerges on --
dialog: cut TO:
speaker_heading: A ROOFTOP
text: We hear the modern SOUNDS of passing AUTO TRAFFIC. CAMERA
dialog: ROTATES to reveal --
scene_heading: EXT. EDNA'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: THE MAU settles by a SATELLITE DISH, looking down on a
text: present-day suburban street, a busy main drag. MARSHLAND and
text: WATER are visible not far away, light RAIN FALLS.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: SUPERIMPOSE: "2500 YEARS LATER."
text: The MAU watches as, ACROSS THE STREET, a BUS pulls away from
text: the curb to reveal a WOMAN in a HOODED WHITE PONCHO
text: -- the outfit recalls the high priestess of Bast.
text: The HOOD is thrown back, revealing PATIENCE PRICE, 25-35,
text: attractive but inclined to conceal her looks -- hair over her
text: face, baggy clothes under her poncho. She's cautious, eager
dialog: to please, to do what's expected of her
dialog: -- a bit of a doormat.
text: Patience looks up from an address scribbled on a scrap of
text: paper, and straight toward the cat on the roof -- almost as
text: if she'd sensed its presence. She smiles.
text: THE MAU holds her gaze for a beat, then slinks out of sight.
scene_heading: EXT. EDNA'S HOME - DAY
text: An eccentric, ramshackle home amongst neat, well-kept houses.
text: PATIENCE moves to the front door, RINGS. As she waits, she
text: notes the lawn GRASS grown high, CLIMBING CAT SCULPTURES on
text: the shingles. A SIGN by the door: "FELINE RESCUE SOCIETY."
text: EDNA POWERS opens the door on a chain. She's 50-70, a former
text: academic, intelligent, charming, but quite intimidating.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Hi, Edna Powers?
dialog: (off her nod)
dialog: I'm Patience Price, I called about adopting a cat?
dialog: I saw your flyer at my vet's office --
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Oh yes, do come inside.
text: EDNA undoes the chain, opens the door for her.
scene_heading: INT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: PATIENCE, out of her poncho, fills out a questionnaire on a
text: clipboard. Numerous CATS roam the premises. Feline artwork
text: and curios, scratching posts, furry toys... cat paradise.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: -+. Ma'am?
text: EDNA is putting out DRY CAT FOOD in numerous BOWLS.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You may call me Edna.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Edna. Some of these questions are... kind of
dialog: personal. Do you really need to know how many, um,
dialog: partners I've had in the past year?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: I'm not interested in your love life. But I do
dialog: want to know what sort of home environment you're
dialog: offering, your degree of commitment...
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Guess I wouldn't need the cat if...
text: Patience forces a laugh, fills in a ZERO and passes the
text: clipboard to EDNA. The woman puts down the cat food, slips
text: on the reading glasses she wears on a chain around her neck.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: The application is mostly a formality. I havea
dialog: sense about people.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Well, I've always liked animals.
dialog: (not enough)
dialog: Cats specifically. I mean, I love them... worship
dialog: them, even.
text: EDNA seems satisfied, returns to reading Patience's answers.
text: THE MAU, meanwhile, comes around a corner into the room,
text: peering curiously at Patience -- who dangles her hand
text: invitingly. He rubs his face against her hand.
text: PATIENCE smiles, coos at the cat -- which grabs her hand hard
text: in his CLAWS. PATIENCE stifles a yelp, yanks her hand back.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Son of a --
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Nothing... handsome cat. I've never seen one like
dialog: him.
text: THE MAU jumps into Patience's lap, settling in. Edna,
text: surprised and almost suspicious, eyes the cat.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Her. That's Midnight, an Egyptian Mau. Normally
dialog: she doesn't trust people --
text: EDNA reaches a hand toward MIDNIGHT -- the cat's fur stands
text: up, she HISSES and SWIPES at Edna.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: See? Even I can't get near her... Very strange.
dialog: (glancing at the
dialog: application)
dialog: So. You left out your parents' address.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Well... they're both dead.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: No hereditary illnesses, I hope.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Private plane crash. I was eleven. Actually, the
dialog: last thing they gave me was a kitten... Fatso.
text: EDNA sucks her breath in at this insulting name.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: He was very round -- not from overfeeding or
dialog: anything, just -- really, he didn't mind. Anyway,
dialog: he was with me a long time, till early this year.
text: He didn't come at the sound of the can-opener,
dialog: which kind of freaked me out... I found him just,
text: curled up there in his little bed...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: PATIENCE is getting a bit emotional. EDNA reaches across and
text: squeezes her hand, with genuine sympathy. MIDNIGHT snuggles
text: into Patience's lap, PURRING as she strokes the cat.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: It's very hard, dear, I know... you must be in so
dialog: much pain.
text: Midnight digs her long NAILS into Patience's thigh, kneading.
text: PATIENCE winces, tries to dislodge cat's claws from her leg
text: -- Midnight "playfully" attacks her hand. Stifling a gasp:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Mm-hmm.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Funny how cats get under our skin. They do exactly
dialog: as they please, they don't care what anyone thinks
dialog: about them... they're the ultimate predators. So
dialog: self-contained, so independent, so wild...
dialog: sometimes I wonder, why do they even put up with
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: The free food?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (putting the papers
dialog: aside)
dialog: Well, congratulations. It seems you've been
dialog: chosen.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: So you think you might have a kitten for me...?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Kitten? No, that wouldn't be appropriate.
dialog: Midnight has chosen you.
text: PATIENCE looks a little unnerved at this. MIDNIGHT, rolling
text: on her back, seems to be baring her fangs at Patience.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: It's a great honor. Maus are a very rare breed,
dialog: descended from the sacred cats of ancient Egypt.
dialog: They were believed to have magical gifts.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: MIDNIGHT has wrapped herself around Patience's arm, kicking
text: and biting "playfully."
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: I'm not sure she likes me --
speaker_heading: EDNA
text: Nonsense, she perceives something very special in
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: There's nothing special about me.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Cats see things we don't. Our secret selves -- our
dialog: souls.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Mm. Do you have any Band-Aids?
dialog: cut TO:
scene_heading: INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: CAMERA MOVES THROUGH this modest, neat studio apartment, PAST
text: a BULLETIN BOARD with numerous PHOTOS. One or two show a
text: YOUNG PATIENCE, there's a picture of a LITTLE GIRL between
text: TWO SMILING PARENTS on a ROLLER COASTER. Mostly, though,
text: they're snapshots of a chubby TABBY CAT, from kitten hood to
text: old age. Suddenly, MIDNIGHT LUNGES INTO FRAME, attacking a
text: picture of FATSO, ripping it from the bulletin board.
text: KEEP MOVING PAST WINDOWS facing on the street and an adjacent
text: BUILDING across an alley -- it's a corner apartment on the
text: second floor. CAMERA HOLDS ON A TV, where a classic OLD
text: MOVIE like Now, Voyager plays. At a key, romantic moment,
scene_heading: CUT TO COMMERCIAL --
text: LAUREL AVENAL strides TOWARD CAMERA -- statuesque, perfect, a
text: supermodel. We hear the VOICE of GEORGES AVENAL:
speaker_heading: GEORGES (V.O.)
dialog: You know who you are. You know what you're after.
text: A MALE MODEL steps INTO FRAME, reaches for her --
speaker_heading: GEORGES (V.O.)
dialog: You know you're too good for any man...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Laurel raises an eyebrow haughtily and SLAPS his face. She
dialog: Moves past the male model to --
text: -- GEORGES AVENAL. He's Laurel's husband and the company
text: C.E.O., handsome and charismatic. LAUREL falls into his
text: arms. He caresses her, deeply in love. Georges WINKS.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: --. almost.
text: CUT TO a PRODUCT SHOT of a JAR OF CREAM, the name "BEAUNIQUE"
text: and the AVENAL LOGO.
speaker_heading: GEORGES (V.O.)
dialog: Beaunique by Avenal. You know you want it.
text: CLOSE ON LAUREL as she tosses her hair back, Gilda-style,
text: with a seductive pout. She purses her lips in a kiss.
text: REVERSE ANGLE -- PATIENCE watches with a curled lip, on the
text: couch in a T-shirt and shorts, EATING CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM
text: directly from a pint carton, a dark smear around her mouth.
text: Suddenly, MIDNIGHT POUNCES at the SPOON OF ICE CREAM.
text: Patience jerks back, startled, raises the spoon out of reach.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: No -- this is mine!
text: MIDNIGHT doesn't back off, jumping repeatedly at the spoon,
text: climbing over Patience, getting a rear PAW in the open pint.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Oh, gross, you -- just take it.
text: Patience offers the cat the half-empty pint. As MIDNIGHT
text: digs in happily, burying his head in the container --
text: LIGHTS COME ON in the apartment across the way.
text: PATIENCE hesitates only an instant, sticks the spoon in her
text: mouth, CLICKS OFF the TV and flips off a LAMP by the sofa.
text: THROUGH THE WINDOW, A HANDSOME MAN -- his name is TOM LONE --
text: crosses past.
text: PATIENCE sighs in the dark, moving for a better view. This
dialog: voyeurism is a guilty habit.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: LONE checks his mail, loosens his tie, unbuttons his shirt.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Welcome home, sweetie. How was work today...?
dialog: (male voice)
dialog: Same old same old. All I wanna do is get out of
dialog: this shirt and give you a big old hug...
text: LONE is distracted, reading his mail, shirt still on.
text: MIDNIGHT, meanwhile, pulls her head out of the ice cream and
text: leaps onto the windowsill -- she looks first at Lone, then at
text: Patience, who looks around her.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Down in front... Come on, you, off with the shirt.
text: Instead, LONE is moving out of view. PATIENCE moves in the
text: same direction, into her BATHROOM.
scene_heading: INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: THE BATHROOM WINDOW faces into Lone's bedroom. He starts to
text: unbutton his shirt, glances casually out the window --
text: PATIENCE immediately ducks out of sight. A moment later, she
text: rises slowly to peek out again --
text: THE WINDOW is DARK, LONE has turned off THE LIGHT.
text: PATIENCE flips ON THE LIGHT, studies her face in the mirror.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Lame, lame, lame.
text: She wipes a bit of chocolate from the corner of her mouth.
text: She tries a seductive pout, a la Laurel, gives her hair a
text: seductive toss -- it winds up in her eyes and mouth.
text: ON PATIENCE'S WINDOW -- from across the alley, we see
text: PATIENCE before her mirror, brushing her hair. PULL BACK to
text: reveal we're watching with TOM LONE, who spies on Patience
text: through his own window, lights off. He SIGHS.
dialog: cut TO:
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - SHOWROOM - DAY
text: MOVING CAMERA delivers an assault on the senses: MIRRORS,
text: oversized versions of the BEAUTY PRODUCTS, charts of COLOR
text: CHOICES, shelves upon shelves of slickly-packaged COSMETICS.
text: Prominent is a DISPLAY for BEAUNIQUE. HIP MUSIC in BG.
text: AVENAL GIRLS, perfectly coiffed and made-up Barbie dolls,
text: busily paint the faces of CLIENTS, women of all ages and
text: backgrounds, in high-tech MAKE-UP CHAIRS that resemble
dialog: torture devices.
text: PATIENCE crosses through, pausing to take off her sneakers
text: and pull on a pair of high heels. SALLY -- an Avenal girl
text: in a prim outfit, working on a matronly CUSTOMER -- looks
text: up to greet PATIENCE. We now see Patience has a small
text: SCRATCH on her cheek, poorly covered with makeup.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Look what the cat dragged in.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: (touching her cheek)
dialog: I know, I know, I'm late -- Midnight thought there
dialog: was a mouse in my pillow.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: This is why I only sleep with my own species.
dialog: Lunch at Joey's?
text: PATIENCE nods and waves as she hurries through a set of doors
text: to an ELEVATOR BANK.
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - ACCOUNTING BULLPEN - DAY
text: OVERHEAD ANGLE on a rat's maze of office cubicles, peopled
text: with ACCOUNTING STAFF. FIND PATIENCE tapping at her
text: terminal, sipping COFFEE. It's a grim little space,
text: enlivened by a GARFIELD toy, some New Yorker cartoons.
text: PATIENCE seems bored by the drone work -- then she cocks her
text: head at something on the screen, leans closer. She double-
text: checks DATA in the print-outs. Something doesn't tally.
text: ON SCREEN -- among a long list of figures, we see "YP-3"
text: highlighted, followed by a series of numbers.
text: PATIENCE gets up quickly with the printouts, she spills a few
text: drops of COFFEE on her white blouse. She dabs at these
text: distractedly as she moves through the bullpen toward a
text: glassed-in office. She knocks on the open door, where we see
scene_heading: the name "D. BERGER - ACCOUNTING."
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Dave, I was just going over the first quarter
dialog: expenses. Our lab fees for this one additive --
text: YP-3 -- have gone through the roof.
text: BERGER, a balding, bespectacled accountant, looks up as
text: Patience moves around his desk to show him some figures.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Look at this, an overage of eight hundred percent
dialog: on "extruded pellets" alone -- I'm not even sure
dialog: what that is --
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: Rat chow.
text: Berger's concerned. As they huddle over the figures, we hear
text: a CHOPPER approach. CAMERA MOVES PAST THEM, OUT the WINDOW -
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - DAY
text: -- CAMERA SWINGS UP the 40-story skyscraper in the business
text: district of a city mixing architecture old and new. CAMERA
text: PASSES a WINDOW WASHER on a cable-driven rig. NEARING the
text: ROOF, we see a glowing sign which reads "AVENAL BEAUTY" --
text: and a PASSENGER CHOPPER coming in for a landing.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - DAY
text: THE CHOPPER touches down on a HELIPAD atop an elevated
text: PENTHOUSE. GEORGES AVENAL emerges, ducking in the blade
text: wash. The company's CEO, Georges is charismatic, handsome,
text: immaculately tailored -- an exacting asshole to the core.
text: Getting out of the helicopter behind him, his menacing,
text: silent bodyguard ANGEL carries a leather suitcase or two.
text: LAUREL AVENAL trots toward her husband with open arms.
text: Laurel is 30-something, a still-gorgeous super-model but, in
text: person, a tad past her prime. She comes across as sweet and
text: well-meaning, but a bit dim and victimized.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Oh honey, welcome back!
text: She throws her arms around Georges to give him a kiss, but he
text: pushes her away, turns aside to SNEEZE.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: My allergies. I thought you were getting rid of
dialog: that vile dog of yours.
text: GEORGES plucks a long DOG HAIR from her clothes, holds it up
text: for her to see, then moves on briskly, down an external
text: flight of stairs from the helipad to a PENTHOUSE below.
text: Laurel follows after him, Angel in the rear.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Georges, when you're gone, Tippy is all I've got
dialog: and -- I get so lonely.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: So get a bird or a fish, something that doesn't
dialog: shed.
dialog: (a glance at her)
dialog: Have you gained weight?
text: They head through glass doors into the PENTHOUSE.
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE - DAY
text: LAUREL protests, examining her body.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: No no, it's muscle -- I've been working out, doing
dialog: my Tae Kwan
dialog: Do --
text: She flexes a MUSCLE to demonstrate. GEORGES isn't
text: interested, looking at the penthouse decor with distaste.
text: Meanwhile ANGEL moves to an elevator, presses a down button
text: and awaits his masters.
text: The penthouse is a large, dramatic space, decorated in a
text: frilly, Louis XIV style -- classical STATUARY of nude
text: females, ornate DRAPERIES across one wall -- there are
text: LADDERS, cans of paint, a work in progress. A large PORTRAIT
text: of LAUREL dominates the room. In one alcove is a MOVIE-STAR
text: MAKE-UP MIRROR, surrounded by lights.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What the hell happened here?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I'm doing some redecorating, I've had so much time
dialog: on my hands -- do you like it?
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: No. What's with the curtains?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Draperies. They soften the space...
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I like hard spaces.
dialog: (off her hurt look)
dialog: Whatever, Laurel, if it makes you happy. I plan to
dialog: be spending more time at the factory, anyway.
text: He enters the ELEVATOR, Laurel behind, Angel hits the button.
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - ELEVATOR BANK - DAY
text: A LARGE GRAPHIC depicts LAUREL and GEORGE together. PATIENCE
text: curls her lip at this as she presses the DOWN button.
text: DOORS OPEN to reveal the real LAUREL and GEORGES, startling
text: Patience a bit, the impassive ANGEL behind them. Patience
text: takes a half-step forward and hesitates, reluctant to get
text: aboard, frozen in place. The DOORS start to close, then open
text: again -- she's in the way.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: In or out?
text: PATIENCE meekly steps into the elevator, presses a button for
text: the lobby, nervously keeping her eyes fixed to the front.
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - ELEVATOR - DAY
text: GEORGES leans past her to hit "DOOR CLOSE." Many CAT HAIRS
text: are sprinkled on her clothes, he SNIFFS and stifles a sneeze.
text: He looks Patience over, and doesn't like what he sees.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Excuse me, miss. Do you know who I am?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Um... of course. You're Georges Avenal -- you own
dialog: the company --
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Then you actually work for me. Are you familiar
dialog: with our products?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Yes sir, I just can't really afford them --
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: You can afford some peroxide, can't you? Do
dialog: something about this mousy hair.
text: GEORGES runs a hand distastefully through her frizzy hair,
text: then takes a moment to study her.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Stain on your blouse, run in your pantyhose -- and
dialog: that color's awful on you.
dialog: (fingering her outfit)
dialog: Do you own an iron? Show me your hands.
text: Shaking, Patience extends her hands. Georges inspects her
text: trembling fingers. He seems saddened, clucks his tongue.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: A nail-biter... my my, you really are the "before"
dialog: picture, aren't you?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I could give her the number for my manicurist --
speaker_heading: GEORGES

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: No, my name's Patience, Patience Price. I'm in
dialog: accounting.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I'm afraid that's no excuse. Regardless of your
dialog: position, you do represent Avenal Beauty. I simply
dialog: can't allow that to continue.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Wait. You're not -- firing me?
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I have no choice. All we have to sell is an image
dialog: -- and you are not it. You've got to go.
text: DING! The DOOR OPENS. Patience stares at the man in
text: disbelief, then bolts out into the SHOWROOM.
text: STAY WITH GEORGES, LAUREL and ANGEL as the doors close.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Poor girl.
text: GEORGES studies Laurel's face a moment, leans closer, amazed.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Is that a pimple?
scene_heading: INT. JOEY'S DINER - DAY
text: A retro place, PATIENCE and SALLY sit in a booth over SALADS

text: make-up -- her mascara's run from crying, her nose is red.
text: An open MAKE-UP POUCH rests between them.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: I try, Sally, I really do. I read Vogue, I wear
dialog: uncomfortable shoes... I've been a female all my
dialog: life, you'd think I'd be better at it by now.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Watch the frown lines, you'll need a lift before

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: He's right, I'm not even presentable enough to be

dialog: ringer.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Look, he was just in a bad mood. Sales are down,
dialog: his marriage is on the rocks --
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: I have an enquiring mind. This is "Nympho," very
dialog: hot, I snagged it from the showroom...
text: a tube of LIPSTICK, starts applying it expertly to
text: Patience's lips as she speaks.
speaker_heading: SALLY
text: Laurel's losing her looks, she's dumber than her
dialog: cockapoo buzz is, Georges is trading her in for
dialog: next year's model. All I'm saying is, by now he's
dialog: probably forgotten about canning you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: I don't care. No way am I going back there.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Shut up, you'll smear... voila, now suck your
dialog: finger.
text: Patience puts her finger in her mouth, pulls it out with a
text: pop, to keep the lipstick off her teeth. She studies the
text: residue on her finger.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: I can't believe we put this stuff on our mouths.
text: Grease, acid and ground-up fish scales... who knows
dialog: what they put in our mascara...

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: You're both scheduled to appear at the Make-Overs

speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Ugh. That one's yours, Laurel.
speaker_heading: WESLEY

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: May I see?
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: You wouldn't be interested.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Please, Georges?
text: She tugs a board away, then sucks in her breath seeing --
text: AN AD featuring DRINA, a gorgeous young model, nearly nude.
text: We see a tube of MASCARA with the AVENAL LOGO.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: That's Drina.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: She's... pretty.
speaker_heading: GEORGES

speaker_heading: GEORGES

dialog: You've had a remarkably long shelf life, it's true.
dialog: But... every product has an expiration date.
text: Laurel bites her lip, looks out the window, close to tears.
text: A PHONE is ringing, ANGEL answers in front. Georges' hands
text: are still full with the ads piled around him.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Uh, sir, it's Dave Berger in accounting.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Who? I don't talk to bean-counters.
speaker_heading: ANGEL

speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Mr. Avenal -- I hate to bother you, sir, but we
dialog: have a problem. It seems the lab has been
dialog: overproducing YP-3 -- that's the anti-aging
dialog: ingredient in
dialog: Beaunique --
speaker_heading: GEORGES

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: We've stockpiled over a thousand gallons, enough to
dialog: last us well into the 29th Century.
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Perhaps that is a trifle optimistic --
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: And very expensive. Funding seems to have been
dialog: siphoned out of the employee pension plan --
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Impossible, this has to be an error. Are you
dialog: responsible for this data?
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: Well, actually Patience Price brought the matter to
dialog: my
dialog: attention --
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Yes, yes, I'm familiar with Ms. Price. Obviously
text: her bookkeeping is as sloppy as her appearance.
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: Sir, she's a very reliable employee --
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: I've heard enough, Berger. In the future, double-
dialog: check your figures before you waste my time -- and
text: then put it in a memo.
speaker_heading: WITH BERGER
speaker_heading: BERGER
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: In all fairness, Mr. Avenal, I think --

speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: I'm sick of drooling over things I'll never have.

speaker_heading: SALLY

text: bodice, a tiny skirt, plenty of plastic skin showing.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Sally, that is not a dress, it's a rumor of a
text: dress. It's barely forensic evidence of a dress.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: It's a genuine Gaultier knock-off --
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: It's not me.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: But don't you ever wanna be somebody else?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE

scene_heading: EXT. BERGER'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PATIENCE

text: A few moments after she's vanished up the stairs, we hear
text: FOOTSTEPS from below and...
text: ANGEL, Georges Avenal's menacing bodyguard, appears in the
text: hallway. He moves purposefully for Patience's door, pushes
text: it open and steps inside. Midnight just saved her neck.
scene_heading: INT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: MIDNIGHT makes for an open hall window that leads onto a FIRE

speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Oh no...
scene_heading: EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - ALLEY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Hell of a jump...
scene_heading: INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PATIENCE

dialog: back --
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Freeze!
text: It's TOM LONE. But Patience loses her balance, FALLS --
text: -- and LANDS in an open DUMPSTER.
text: LONE darts from the window, alarmed, realizing his error.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - NIGHT
text: ANGEL emerges, shaking his head and shrugging toward the
text: unseen driver of the BLACK MERCEDES, then he climbs in the
text: passenger door. As the car pulls away --
text: -- LONE hurries from the building next-door toward the alley.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - ALLEY - NIGHT
text: PATIENCE painfully gets upright, slipping in the trash, as
text: LONE appears; he's a no-nonsense, gruff cop with a dry wit.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: You all right?
text: He clambers onto the dumpster's edge to help her out, she
text: slips and slides, almost pulls him in after her.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: I'm really sorry -- I'm a police officer, I heard
dialog: the noise and just assumed... here, grab my arm.
text: He manages to hoist Patience to the lip, she's able to climb
text: to the ground. She's drenched in GOOEY GARBAGE, just stares
text: at Lone, a bit dazed from the fall. She can't believe she's
text: face to face with the man of her dreams. Lone thinks a beat.
speaker_heading: LONE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: PATIENCE

speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: I mean, I -- I've seen you. Around.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Really. Actually, I've seen you too. Around, that

dialog: (a nod at the

dialog: Thanks for helping me out.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Don't mention it. I can't resist a damsel in
dialog: distress.
text: PATIENCE smiles and cocks her head... flirtatious body
text: language. She runs a hand through her hair, pulls out some
text: sticky TISSUE PAPER, looks at it with disgust.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Oh God, what -- what is that?!
text: He looks over her shoulder, winces.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: I could run it over to the lab...
text: She tosses it in the dumpster, finally registering that she's

text: heavy make-up, a revealing skin-tight outfit that shows
text: plenty of cleavage. Patience is in a conservative dress, one

text: something Patience has just said. Patience looks grim.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: It isn't funny.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: (still chuckling)
dialog: Yes it is. All this time you've spent mooning over
dialog: that hottie neighbor and he points a gun at you --
speaker_heading: PATIENCE

dialog: outfit?
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: With any luck, I won't need to.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE

speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: ow!
text: SANDY looks at her blankly as PATIENCE hops, injured.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: You could say I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: RANDY

dialog: aside for them to enter.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: God, people are so rude.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: Yes!
text: Sally has just gotten the NOD, hurries forward. Patience

text: looking her over from head to toe, disapproving.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: She's with me.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Then you can stay out here too.
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: She happens to be a very fine human being --
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Like I said, she don't belong inside.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE

scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT

text: A YOUNG COUPLE making out... an ELDERLY COUPLE holding hands.
text: Her eyes drift to an AD for AVENAL BEAUTY overhead -- LAUREL
text: and GEORGES AVENAL, arms around each other. Patience sighs
text: and stares out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - NIGHT
text: PATIENCE walks toward her building, the bus kiosk behind her,
text: the BUS MOVING AWAY. The street is deserted at this hour.
text: Patience feels very alone, until she looks up to see --
text: -- MIDNIGHT, perched in her window, awaiting her arrival.
text: A smile appears on Patience's face. She quickens her step,
text: crossing the empty street, almost to the sidewalk when --
text: -- AN ENGINE ROARS behind her. Patience spins just as --
text: -- THE MERCEDES, LIGHTS OFF, barrels out of the darkness and
text: WHAM! Hits her full-on.
text: MIDNIGHT at the WINDOW -- the cat lets out a HOWL.
text: ANGLE DOWN, the MERCEDES has stopped, Patience lies a short
text: distance behind... in bad shape. The PASSENGER DOOR OPENS.
text: WITH PATIENCE, barely conscious. ANGEL approaches, studies
text: her, turns her over with his foot. He nods, a job well done.
scene_heading: INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: MIDNIGHT is bouncing off the walls, HOWLING like mad, lunging
text: and scratching at the door. Finally, the cat charges across
text: the floor, LAUNCHES herself in a dramatic leap and --

text: SLOW MOTION as MIDNIGHT LAUNCHES HERSELF AT THE GLASS --
speaker_heading: SMASH!

scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE/CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT
text: SPLASH! A BODY (we don't get a good look) hits DARK WATER

text: over a river, CITY LIGHTS in the distance. ON THE ROADWAY,
text: CAR DOORS CLOSE and the MERCEDES SEDAN SCREECHES away.
text: CLOSER ON THE SKYLINE. A HOWL rises -- FIND MIDNIGHT, CRYING
text: from a rooftop. Unseen CATS join in, a feline TELEGRAPH.
scene_heading: EXT. EDNA'S HOME - NIGHT
text: The CAT CRY, just audible, far off. Then -- a CAT squeezes
text: out a WINDOW at the gap in the sill... more CATS SCRAMBLE out
text: dormers... yet MORE SHOOT OUT the flapping CAT DOOR.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT
text: EDNA'S CATS scramble through alleyways, joined by STRAYS
text: converging from all directions, picking up the CHORUS. It's
text: like a flowing RIVER OF CATS.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHLAND - NIGHT
text: ON MURKY MOONLIT WATER -- CAMERA MOVES past floating TRASH, a
text: CAR TIRE, BOTTLES and CANS. We hear the CRIES of the CATS
text: from nearby, approaching. LIGHTS of the CITY further away,
text: the BRIDGE visible.
text: CAMERA FINDS a nylon-encased FOOT... PAN OVER a woman's
text: CORPSE, her clothes TORN, SOAKED and MUDDY, strewn with RIVER
text: WEEDS. The body bobs amidst REEDS by this soggy shoreline.
text: We reach the woman's FACE -- unnaturally pale, eyes fixed...
text: it's PATIENCE PRICE. Dead.
text: THE HOWLING is CLOSE now... THE CATS have gathered here,
text: parting for MIDNIGHT, a feline VIP. The Mau steps
text: tentatively out onto Patience's corpse, careful not to get
text: too wet. She crouches on her chest, and --
text: CLOSE, BREATHES audibly into her parted lips. A brief,
text: barely visible GLOW flickers at Patience's mouth.
text: THE CAT shudders, then moves aside, BLINKS as if drugged.

scene_heading: DARK, DISTORTED; QUICK IMPRESSIONISTIC IMAGES OVERLAP,
scene_heading: perhaps CAT POVS (LOW-ANGLE TRACKING and CLIMBING SHOTS)
dialog: mixed with human MEMORIES:
text: POV, a ROLLER-COASTER, PATIENCE'S PARENTS to either side --

text: CLOSE TO GROUND, FATSO the KITTEN dashes after a BELL BALL.
text: POV, YOUNG PATIENCE at a mirror in a Halloween CAT COSTUME.
text: POV, CLIMBING A TREE in a suburban backyard. We see her MOM
text: below, searching for young Patience.
text: POV, TWO CLOSED COFFINS, surrounded by FLOWERS... now we hear
text: YOUNG PATIENCE SOBBING.
text: POV, the BLACK MERCEDES ROCKETS AT CAMERA and --
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHLAND - NIGHT (PRESENT)
text: -- PATIENCE sits up INTO FRAME with a SCREAM.
text: She thrashes in the shallows of the marsh, gasping for air,
text: disoriented... reborn. There's no sign of the cats.
text: PATIENCE crawls onto shore amidst the reeds, slightly clumsy
text: at first, almost like a newborn kitten. Her ragged, wet
text: clothes cling to her body.
text: TIGHT on her terrified expression. She has no idea what
text: she's doing here -- or who, or what she is. She opens her
text: mouth to speak -- all that comes out is a strangled CAT CRY.
text: She works her jaw, but can't produce human speech. She darts
text: her head, seems disoriented and overwhelmed.
scene_heading: HER POV -- SOUNDS AMPLIFIED, IMAGE perhaps SOLARIZED, the
text: darkness BRIGHTENED, objects of interest HIGHLIGHTED as she
text: takes in the marshland. The EYES of any creature in sight
dialog: GLOW. We'll call this CATVISION.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: WHIP PAN TO a nearby CRICKET perched on a blade of grass --
text: then UP TO an OWL in the distance, soaring over the park.
text: WHIP DOWN TO its prey, a SCURRYING MOUSE. THE OWL swoops
text: with a SCREECH, nailing the MOUSE, we hear its SQUEAL.
text: PATIENCE, frightened at first, becomes increasingly delighted
text: by her heightened senses. She spots --
text: MIDNIGHT in the tall grass. The cat turns, looks over her
text: shoulder once -- her EYES catch moonlight and GLOW. Patience
text: is clearly meant to follow.
text: PATIENCE follows MIDNIGHT on all fours, tenuously at first.
text: But as she proceeds, her shoulders and hips roll in
text: distinctly feline fashion. Her body seems slimmer, more
text: muscular. She rises on two legs, moving in a slinky crouch.
text: MIDNIGHT pauses to sharpen her claws on the bark of a gnarled
text: old TREE. PATIENCE follows Midnight's lead, leans forward
text: against the trunk, arms straight out, head arched back. She
text: stretches her neck, her back -- her every movement is
text: graceful, sensual, the awkwardness gone.
text: She tries to pull her hands from the tree -- but can't for a
text: moment, finding her FINGER-NAILS stuck into the bark (like a
text: cat at a scratching post).
text: A DOG BARKS -- without thinking about it, PATIENCE scrambles
text: up the side of the tree like a streak.
text: HER POV FROM TREE -- A LARGE DOG tugs on its OWNER'S leash,
text: some distance away. The dog walker yanks the dog onward.
text: PATIENCE takes this in, hears a MEOW --
text: MIDNIGHT is perched above her, very Cheshire Cat-like.
text: PATIENCE looks around, self-conscious for a moment -- what is
dialog: she doing up a tree? Bad idea to think. She loses her
text: balance, clutching at branches, tumbles out of the tree --
text: IN MIDAIR for an instant, she flails spastically, letting out
text: a SHRIEK -- then her body instinctively TWISTS and --
text: PATIENCE LANDS on all fours, one leg kicked out, haunches
text: low. MIDNIGHT lands beside her, nods approvingly at her
text: landing. Then the cat darts away again, Patience pursues.
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
text: MIDNIGHT leaps to the top of a FENCE, staring down at
text: Patience -- "come on." Patience hesitates, then crouches and
text: SPRINGS UP (with more than human ability), lands triumphantly
text: on the fence -- then teeters and TUMBLES to the other side.
text: MIDNIGHT looks disappointed. Patience jumps up again
text: quickly, as if pretending this never happened, this time
text: managing to hold her balance.
text: MIDNIGHT gives her a look and leads onward. At first she's
text: like a tightrope walker, careful of falling, but her steps
text: become more confident. Soon she's moving as quickly and
text: smoothly as the cat.
text: MIDNIGHT leaps off the fence and darts across a road,
text: PATIENCE follows.
scene_heading: EXT. PUBLIC GARDEN/ZOO - NIGHT
text: A tall wrought-iron FENCE surrounds greenery and distant
text: cages in an urban area. A SIGN: "ARBORETUM - ZOO."
text: MIDNIGHT squeezes through a gap between the uprights.
text: PATIENCE hesitates -- this is too narrow for a normal human.
text: MIDNIGHT waits impatiently on the other side, tail twitching.
text: PATIENCE makes a dubious SOUND, but manages to slip a foot --
text: then a leg -- into the opening, twisting and contorting.
text: Amazingly, she's succeeding, her torso ripples and contracts
text: as she insinuates herself between the bars. Finally only her
text: head is on the wrong side. With a final TUG, she's through.
text: MIDNIGHT crouches low, stalking. PATIENCE copies the
text: behavior. MIDNIGHT slowly approaches --
text: A MOTH, fluttering near a FLOWER in this botanical garden.
text: MIDNIGHT sneaks up close, then POUNCES, but the MOTH flies
text: out of the cat's grasp.
text: PATIENCE GIGGLES, MIDNIGHT turns on her and HISSES. The
text: woman and the cat roll together in this neat BOTANICAL
text: GARDEN, playing and batting at each other. CAMERA MOVES TO a
text: small sign nearby, which labels this planting as "CATNIP."
text: MIDNIGHT HURTLES a CONCRETE MOAT, PATIENCE follows, still
text: high, giggly. She suddenly finds herself face to face with:
text: A BENGAL TIGER. He lets out a small ROAR.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. EDNA'S HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING

text: out of bed in her nightdress.
scene_heading: EXT. EDNA'S HOME - DAY

speaker_heading: EDNA

dialog: bush.
text: Edna GASPS, moves closer, crouching to get a better look.

speaker_heading: EDNA

scene_heading: INT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

text: EDNA blinks at this, PATIENCE whirls on her with an abrupt
dialog: and frightening HISS --
text: CLOSE, Patience's pupils become ELLIPTICAL for a blink,

text: She yanks her hand away quickly, immediately looks contrite,
text: and a bit dazed from the momentary transformation.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Sorry, you -- you startled me... look, Edna, thanks
dialog: for everything, but -- I just want to get home and
dialog: take a bath.
text: Edna nods, unnerved. PATIENCE picks MIDNIGHT up in her arms

text: disturbing thought forming.
scene_heading: INT. EDNA'S HOME - OFFICE - DAY
text: EDNA moves purposefully to a FILE CABINET in this cluttered,
text: book-lined room and opens a drawer. She thumbs past many
text: years' worth of scholarly research, finally pulling a thick,
text: dog-eared MANILA FILE from near the back. She moves to her
text: desk, slips on reading glasses and opens the folder --
text: ANGLE ON FILE -- an old, thick type-written SCHOLARLY PAPER
text: entitled "MYTHS OF FELIGYNY, by E. POWERS Ph.D." She puts
text: this aside, revealing a WOODCUT of an AFRICAN Catwoman in
text: leopard skin, surrounded by cats. Next, an ASIAN CATWOMAN, a
text: print of a 19th Century watercolor. She wears a Chinese-

scene_heading: FLASHBACK - INT. PATIENCE'S HEAD

scene_heading: INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY (PRESENT)
text: PATIENCE starts, shaking off this momentary vision.
text: She dips a finger in the water, jerks back -- much as a cat
text: might. She shakes drops off her hand, repelled by the water.
scene_heading: INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: There's KNOCKING at the door. The PHONE IS RINGING, a

speaker_heading: PATIENCE (V.O.)

text: MIDNIGHT lets out a menacing GROWL.
text: THE KNOB TURNS, the door swings open -- a MAN starts to enter
text: CLANG! PATIENCE whacks him over the head with a FRYING PAN.
text: THE MAN is knocked hard into the door and slumps to the
text: ground, stunned... it's TOM LONE.
text: PATIENCE recognizes him with horror, looks at the door --
text: PATIENCE'S KEYS with the "HELLO KITTY" emblem dangle from the
text: lock, her PURSE is on the ground.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: I am so, so sorry --

speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: You actually hit me with a frying pan?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: I didn't know it was you.
speaker_heading: LONE

text: PATIENCE returns with a washcloth full of ice.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: That was really nice of you.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Well, it's part of my job... I'm a detective,
dialog: burglary-robbery division. So what did happen to
dialog: you?
text: He applies the ice-pack to his head while eying her clothes.
text: She suddenly becomes aware of her disheveled appearance.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Oh no, I'm amess. It seems every time you see me
dialog: I -- I was just cleaning.
dialog: (this isn't flying)
dialog: The um, the chimney.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Where's the fireplace?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: It wasn't mine.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: You're a freelance chimney sweep?
text: LONE is now looking around the apartment, taking it all in
text: with a careful detective's eye. He sees the shredded
scene_heading: PHOTOGRAPHS, the BROKEN WINDOW, points --
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: You should get that fixed.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE

speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: So everything's all right now?
dialog: (off her nod)
dialog: Well, I'd better be getting to the station, then...
dialog: unless there's anything else.
text: LONE hopes so, PATIENCE desperately wants him to stay... but
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: I guess not...
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Then -- bye, now.
text: He sounds disappointed. As the door shuts, Patience clutches

scene_heading: INT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
text: PATIENCE flings open the door, calls after Lone:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: I want you...
text: He turns, startled. Patience has a sultry, come-hither look
text: in her eye, her VOICE has a lower, sexier tone.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Excuse me?
text: She shudders. The sexy expression turns to one of shock and
text: anxiety -- what has she done? Then, vamping:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: I want you, um, to forgive me. For hitting you
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: No need -- woman living alone, you can't take any

dialog: So, did you always want to be a policeman?
dialog: (beat, rolling her eyes)
dialog: God, listen to me, Conversation 101.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: (a laugh)
dialog: Hey, we gotta start somewhere. Actually, when I
dialog: was a kid, I wanted to be a rock star.
text: They take seats at a small table.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: I was kind of a delinquent back then, got into some
dialog: trouble. There was a cop who helped me out. Made
dialog: a difference. I figured... maybe I could do the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Plus you can still get into trouble.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Right, but for the good guys... So what do you do?
dialog: When you're not dumpster diving or cleaning

speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Let me start over. It's just... I never got into
dialog: any trouble or anything --
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Come on, never?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Well, when I was little, but -- after I lost my
dialog: folks I... I guess I turned into sort of a scaredy-
dialog: ca -- um, pretty risk-averse.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: That's not a bad thing. It's a pretty dangerous
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Sometimes I just wish I was less of a wimp.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: You're not afraid to admit you're afraid -- that

speaker_heading: PATIENCE

speaker_heading: LONE

speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Okay, with too much YP-3 you get side-effects --
dialog: but too much of anything is bad for you -- tap
dialog: water, sunshine, cigarettes --
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: It's like leprosy or something...
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: The point is, now that we've adjusted the formula,
text: Beaunique works. Plumps the skin, removes
text: wrinkles, leaves a nice rosy glow -- it's perfectly
dialog: safe now, my own wife uses it...
dialog: 
text: His voice trails off as he considers this fact. He glances
text: at the medical pictures, puts them aside. Airy denial:
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: You want to be beautiful, you've got to make
dialog: certain sacrifices. I mean, look at Botox, women
text: are lining up to get their faces paralyzed.
text: NEVSKI has been doing a slow burn, now blurts out:
speaker_heading: NEVSKI
dialog: Enough! Pretending my YP-3 is only for your
dialog: cosmetics, feh! You've known about these "side-
dialog: effects" from the start, they are not side-effects
dialog: at all --
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: What? You're not making sense --
speaker_heading: NEVSKI
dialog: I thought I'd left this sort of madness behind me -

speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: Sir, are you seriously thinking of recalling
dialog: Beaunique --?
speaker_heading: GEORGES

text: CLOSE ON PATIENCE'S EYES -- they FLY OPEN, GOLD-FLECKED and
text: (for a moment) ELLIPTICAL.
text: PATIENCE -- now pure CATWOMAN -- springs down gracefully and
text: scans the dark apartment. She stretches her limbs
text: languorously, licks her lips. She flexes her fingers,
text: watching appreciatively as her CLAWS EMERGE.
text: She reaches out and SPEARS LONE'S CARD on a fingernail,
text: regards it as she picks up the receiver. With another CLAW
text: she unhesitatingly punches in the number. When she speaks,

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: And the cat came back, the very next day...
text: MOVE UP SLOWLY to reveal the rest of the ensemble -- long

dialog: floor -- not that he needs a lot of encouragement.
text: CATWOMAN shoves the man onto the dance floor ahead of her.
text: She begins to writhe sensuously to the music, instantly the

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Don't touch my tail.

speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: That's enough for one night, honey.

speaker_heading: STOPS.

scene_heading: EXT. TRENDY CLUB - NIGHT

text: Then she picks up a distant TINKLE of breaking GLASS --
scene_heading: INT. JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT
text: Dimly lit, an older, discount place. THIEF #1 methodically
text: breaks DISPLAY CASES with a wrapped hammer, snatches up the

text: Each time he turns his head, she has just slinked out of his

text: THIEF #2, with a SHOTGUN, stands guard over a blindfolded,

speaker_heading: THIEF #2
dialog: What the hell was that?!
text: CATWOMAN springs out from behind a DISPLAY CASE, gives Thief

text: THIEF #1 pulls a HANDGUN, but the END OF THE WHIP wraps
text: around it in a flash, yanks it from his hand.
text: CATWOMAN SNAPS HER WHIP at Thief #1 and Thief #3, backing

speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: You are cute.

speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: I'm a police officer!
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Bet you look sweet in uniform. And such a big
dialog: gun...
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: I, I -- Come down here, now!
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Obviously you don't know much about cats. I come
dialog: when I want, not when I'm told.
text: With that, she SPRINGS to the rooftop -- the force of her
text: leap knocks the A/C free of the window, LONE has to dive out
text: of the way as it CRASHES to the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOPS/CITY STREETS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She blinks and frowns at the SUNLIGHT. Where am I? She sits

text: CATWOMAN SHRIEKS and leaps to her feet, terrified, yanks OFF
text: HER MASK. With the daylight, she's back to being plain old
text: PATIENCE. She looks down in shock at her revealing outfit;
text: the swag bag is looped into the whip around her waist.
text: She's awakened the TIGER. Patience lets out another
text: frightened CRY as he eyes her, no longer recognizing her as a
text: friend. The tiger GROWLS, gets to his feet menacingly,

text: PATIENCE scrambles for a heavily LATCHED DOOR, which she

speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: You were afraid -- you became its prey. The tiger
dialog: shredded your clothes?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: No, I did that myself. I mean, I remember doing

dialog: don't understand what's happening.
speaker_heading: EDNA

speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Edna, please. Can we talk about me?
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Oh, yes. The other night... I think you may

dialog: Fatal.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: (as if to a child)
dialog: But -- I'm not dead.
speaker_heading: EDNA

speaker_heading: PATIENCE

text: EDNA pulls back, looks Patience in the eye.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Relax a little, learn to live with your inner cat.
dialog: Even love her -- she has many admirable qualities
dialog: -- integrate her into your life. If you accept the

speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: No. I'm going to fight her. I'm stronger than she

speaker_heading: LONE (0.S.)
dialog: We've got to stop meeting like this.

speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Doing some spring cleaning?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE

speaker_heading: LONE

text: FIND a HIGH BOX to one side. GEORGES and DRINA, in formal
text: clothes. GEORGES is absorbed in the performance, DRINA looks
text: bored, wrinkles her nose.
speaker_heading: DRINA
dialog: What is this about?
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Ssh.
dialog: (impatient whisper)
text: Giselle is mistreated by a cruel prince and kills
text: herself. Later, the souls of betrayed women come
text: back from the grave for revenge.
text: DRINA makes a SNORING NOISE, puts on a WALKMAN, and is soon
text: bobbing her head to faint ROCK MUSIC.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
text: BALLET MUSIC CONTINUES OVER. A CITY BUS passes, an AD FOR
text: AVENAL on the side -- it's been VANDALIZED, CLAW MARKS across
dialog: the length of it.
text: CRANE UP to find CATWOMAN crouched on the roof of the bus.
text: She leaps off from the still-moving bus --
text: -- onto the ROOF of a TAXI passing the other way --
text: -- and finally landing at the curb near --
text: A classical-looking CONCERT HALL, FOUNTAINS in front.
text: CATWOMAN creeps amongst bushes, approaching the building.
text: Numerous COPS patrol the entrance -- no way to get past them.
text: CATWOMAN creeps around the perimeter, looking for another way
text: in. By the curb she spots --
text: ANGEL, alone, near a parked LIMOUSINE, lighting a cigarette.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Those things'1ll kill you.
text: She SMACKS the cigarette out of his hand, BOOTS him into the
text: BUSHES and leaps on top of him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: IN THE BUSHES, CATWOMAN straddles ANGEL, bangs his head
text: against a cement curb.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: YP-3 -- the plague -- what's it for?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I have no idea what you're --
text: BANG! She whams his head again.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Tell me about Xavier Bartok.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: How do you know --
text: She BANGS his head again.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I'm asking the questions.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: I -- I can't tell you --
text: She bares her CLAWS over his eyes.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Then it's time to brush up on your Braille.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: No, no, not my eyes! Xavier, he's the one who's
dialog: buying the stuff!
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: The deal goes down tomorrow night -- at the Avenal
dialog: offices --
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Wrong. Your boss won't live to see it.
text: She BANGS his head hard again, ANGEL loses consciousness.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Thanks for your help.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: CATWOMAN moves around the side of the building, keeping low,
text: ducking behind parked cars. Fewer COPS here, but the place
text: looks impregnable, no way to scale the walls. She tries an
text: EMERGENCY DOOR -- locked, no good. She hisses in
dialog: frustration, starts to move on when --
text: THE DOOR OPENS behind her. CATWOMAN spins to see --
text: LAUREL, her face hidden with dark glasses and a wide-brimmed
text: hat. She gestures frantically. Catwoman darts inside.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: LAUREL whips off the hat and glasses, gives a girly hug to
text: Catwoman, who pulls back immediately.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I knew you'd come.
text: Laurel leads Catwoman through this basement boiler room.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
text: He's with his bimbo in a box to the right of the
dialog: stage. But there's all kinds of security -- he's
dialog: pretty scared of you.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: He should be. How much do you know about your
dialog: husband's operation?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I know he's built an empire out
dialog: of women's inadequacy and self-hatred --
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Yeah, yeah, but the secret ingredient in his face
dialog: cream -- it's black plague bacteria. He's selling
text: it to an arms dealer.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (touching her face)
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
text: And he's committed murder to protect his secret.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Nothing he does would surprise me anymore. He's a
dialog: monster. You should've seen the pre-nup, I don't
dialog: get a dime --
text: CATWOMAN has reached an emergency STAIRCASE, cuts her off,
text: bolting upward.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I'll take it from here.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: CATWOMAN slinks along a hallway, past a couple of bored young
text: USHERS. They give her a sidelong look.
dialog: Cats is next month...
text: UNIFORM COPS are clustered near a FORMAL STAIRCASE, blocking
text: her access to the right-hand side of the hall.
text: CATWOMAN bares her teeth in frustration. She hurries toward
text: a VELVET ROPE, the sign, "BOXES - PRIVATE." She slips past
text: the rope, moves to a far door.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
text: AN OLD COUPLE SNORE through the ballet. CATWOMAN appears
text: behind them in the box, snatches OPERA GLASSES from the
text: woman's lap and scans the hall --
text: HER POV, ZOOMING from box to box -- finding GEORGES in a box
text: on the opposite side of the hall. DRINA is rising, heading
text: out the door.
text: CATWOMAN climbs up the CURTAINS around the box, levering
text: herself upward to the elaborate FRIEZE that wraps around the
text: top of the hall -- GREEK GODS in various dramatic poses.
text: WIDER, FROM BELOW, as CATWOMAN climbs and creeps near the
text: ceiling, moving over the PROSCENIUM ARCH above the stage,
text: heading toward GEORGES.
text: A POLICEMAN at ground level spots her -- he lifts a radio to
text: his lips, calling for backup.
text: The BALLET below is reaching a crescendo. COPS are filing in
text: from the back of the theatre, trying to be discreet.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: WITH GEORGES, still absorbed in the ballet. Suddenly
text: CATWOMAN lands in the empty seat beside him, staring at the
text: stage herself. A whisper:
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I love this part.
text: GEORGES spins, startled -- and she SLASHES HIM across his
text: cheek. The MUSIC is so loud, no one hears his CRY OF PAIN.
text: GEORGES rushes for the exit -- but CATWOMAN gets there first,
text: shoves a CHAIR under the doors.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Let's not be interrupted.
text: She advances on him, BLOOD drips from the SLASHES on his
text: cheek, staining his tuxedo shirt.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Red's a good color on you.
text: At that, she grabs Georges and slams him against the wall of
text: the box, behind a curtain, partly concealed from view. The
text: DOOR RATTLES, increasingly hard.
text: CLOSE as CATWOMAN wraps a hand around Georges' throat, the
text: CLAW TIPS digging into his skin. He gasps:
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: No -- please --
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I could rip out your throat...
speaker_heading: GEORGES
dialog: Why -- why kill me?
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Because you deserve it. And because I can.
scene_heading: THROUGH BINOCULARS -- CATWOMAN holding Georges, but still not
text: delivering the deathblow.
text: LAUREL spies from the back of the theatre. Under her breath:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: C'mon honey... just do it.
text: CATWOMAN'S HAND trembles on Georges' throat. His eyes well
text: up with tears, his expression pleading, desperate. Suddenly
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: CATWOMAN releases him, throws him GASPING to the floor.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Damn it. I can't.
text: THE CHAIR SPLINTERS and the DOOR flies open, ARMED POLICE
text: with DRINA behind them.
text: CATWOMAN leaps to the lip of the box, turns and HISSES, then
text: -- jumps down to the middle of the stage, amidst the DANCERS.
text: AUDIENCE UPROAR, MUSIC STOPS, COPS charge up the
dialog: aisles --
text: CATWOMAN does a pirouette, bows and bolts into the wings.
text: After a puzzled BEAT, the CONDUCTOR waves his baton and gets
text: the show going again.
text: LAUREL looks agonized -- Catwoman was so close.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: MUSIC CONTINUES as CATWOMAN darts between stored PROPS and
text: FLATS from a GRAVEYARD SCENE, bowling over costumed DANCERS.
text: Seeing POLICEMEN blocking an exit, she dodges between DROPS,
text: scrambles up a FLY-LINE --
text: POLICE track her from below -- she leaps between sandbagged
text: ROPES as the BAGS drop, scrambling higher onto the GRID --
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
text: ON STAGE, inappropriate SCRIMS and PROPS descend and rise
text: again. DANCERS dodge and weave as a GIANT GARBAGE CAN (think
text: Cats) descends in the midst of the VILLAGE SQUARE.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: CATWOMAN darts effortlessly across the overhead grid, when --
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Freeze!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: TOM LONE, anticipating her move, has climbed a ladder to the
text: grid. He trains a gun on her -- CATWOMAN freezes. She
text: stares at him, breathing hard, taking a moment to come to
text: grips with this adversary. LONE advances on her, stepping
text: gingerly.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: You're under arrest --
text: He steps on a flimsy support, which starts to give way.
text: Catwoman is alarmed.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Watch out!
text: LONE sways, losing his balance, she springs and grabs his gun
text: arm, saving him. A beat as they look at each other, then --
text: -- she SNATCHES the gun out of his hand, tosses it aside,
text: then grabs his tie and pulls his face to her to LICK his
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Tag, you're it.
text: She bounds away, comfortable on the narrow railings. Lone
text: pursues, moving more carefully now. Accompanied by the
text: ballet music, the two perform their private dance, high above
text: the TOMBSTONES and GRAVES.
text: CATWOMAN winds up in a corner on a MESH PLATFORM, no way out
dialog: from here, but for a 25-foot drop to --
text: THE FLOOR, where POLICE await, pointing upward.
text: LONE advances, he has her trapped. He pulls HANDCUFFS.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
text: Handcuffs. Yummy.
text: He lunges at her -- she dodges, kicks a leg out from under
text: him. No slouch at fighting, Lone recovers, plants a kick in
text: her mid-section. She gasps, surprised.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: You play rough.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: This isn't a game.
text: He charges at her, but she parries a blow, lands a SLASH
text: across his shoulder. As he comes at her again, she jumps and
text: grabs an overhead ELECTRICAL cable, swinging away --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Lone has too much momentum, he loses balance, about to go
text: over the edge -- CATWOMAN swings back like a pendulum,
text: wrapping her legs around his neck, saving him from falling.
text: She swings him back over the platform, tries to kick him off,
text: but he grabs her legs, pulling her and SNAPPING THE CABLE --
text: STAGE LIGHTS go out, ELECTRICAL SPARKS fly as they hit the
text: platform together, she lands straddling him, catching the
text: SPARKING CABLE just before it strikes the mesh.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Be careful! That thing hits the metal, we're both
dialog: fried!
text: CATWOMAN leans close, whispers:
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I knew there was a spark between us.
text: She turns and flings the cable away, it dangles free of the
text: mesh floor, still spitting SPARKS. A second later, CLICK --
text: LONE has slapped a handcuff on her wrist, CLICKS the other
text: cuff over his own. CATWOMAN spins back on him, looking hurt.
text: He reaches to pull off her mask. She slaps his hand.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Please, it's our first date. I wouldn't want the
dialog: mystery to go out of our relationship.
text: LONE struggles to push her off, but she keeps her thighs
text: locked around him. He finally rolls on top of her.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: We don't have a relationship.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: (mock sadness)
dialog: You men love the chase, but once you catch us, you
dialog: always lose interest.
text: As she speaks, CLOSE on her cuffed hand -- her fingers
text: squeeze together, her hand slithers out of the cuff like a
text: cat's paw.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: LONE rises, tries to pull Catwoman to her feet -- but he
text: comes up with an empty, dangling HANDCUFF.
text: From the ground, CATWOMAN plants a kick in his back from
text: behind, he falls forward and SLAMS his FACE HARD into a LIGHT
text: RIG. Catwoman winces, sounding a lot like Patience:
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Sorry.
text: She's on her feet, ready to scamper off, but --
text: MORE COPS have made it to the grid, blocking every way down -
text: ANGLE DOWN, COPS have covered every exit below.
text: LONE glares up at her.
speaker_heading: LONE
text: It's over.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: And here I thought we were hitting it off...
text: With that, she leaps and grabs the dangling POWER LINE which
text: TEARS LOOSE from the ceiling --
text: She DROPS to the floor, still holding the CABLE. COPS
text: surround her, moving in quickly, guns drawn --
text: She backs toward the wall, near a CIRCUIT BREAKER PANEL.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Show of hands -- who can see in the dark?
text: She lifts her own hand daintily, then violently SWINGS THE
text: POWER CABLE into the CIRCUIT BREAKERS --
text: A FLASH, a BANG, a SHOWER OF SPARKS -- then --
text: PITCH DARKNESS. We hear SHOUTS from the theatre, people
text: PANICKING, and a series of GRUNTS and OOFS as Catwoman takes
dialog: out the nearest adversaries --
scene_heading: CATWOMAN POV -- CATVISION, FIGURES have a pale outline, their
text: EYES GLOW, as CATWOMAN dispatches her unseeing opponents.
dialog: 94.
scene_heading: EXT. CONCERT HALL - STAGE DOOR & SIDE STREET - NIGHT
text: A SIDE DOOR swings open and CATWOMAN darts out. She's almost
text: home free when SHOTS RING OUT behind her --
text: ANGEL, staggering out from the bushes where she clocked him,
text: FIRES his handgun after her.
text: CATWOMAN stumbles and rolls, but keeps moving.
dialog: cut TO:
scene_heading: INT. EDNA'S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: EDNA holds a few CATS in her arms, WEEPING quietly, tissue
text: close at hand. There's a sound of SCRATCHING at the window,
text: she moves to open it, revealing --
text: CATWOMAN, exhausted and bruised from her battle. She crawls
text: in the window, as Edna stares in astonishment.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Patience?
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Not exactly.
text: She throws herself on the end of the bed, curling up with the
text: other cats, examining her injuries. She finds a bloody GASH
text: where Angel's bullet grazed her skin. EDNA moves closer.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Oh dear. You've been shot.
text: Edna hurries into the bathroom and emerges with a small
text: FIRST-AID KIT, begins tending to Catwoman's wound, still
text: sniffling.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: It's nothing to cry about.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: No, it's my cats. Last night, all that noise --
dialog: the neighbors complained. Animal Control says
dialog: they're a health hazard...
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Piss on ‘em.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: They're coming tomorrow to take them away, have
dialog: them destroyed --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: It won't happen. I promise.
text: EDNA studies Catwoman, speaks softly, worried.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Did you do it? Did you kill him?
text: CATWOMAN shakes her head, disgusted with herself.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I wanted to -- but I couldn't. I actually... felt
dialog: sorry for him.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Because you're still Patience Price.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Don't remind me. That girl is so weak.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: No, she isn't. You know that.
text: Catwoman makes an exasperated noise, then YAWNS.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I could really use a nap.
text: So saying, she rolls over and falls asleep at once.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - DAY

speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Oh! Hi. Listen-- about last night...
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Forget it. I, um... listen, I'm sorry about this.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He takes a few steps back as --

text: sidewalk in front of Patience's building. COPS armed with
text: SHOTGUNS leap out, train their weapons on her.
speaker_heading: PATROL COP
dialog: Hands in the air!
text: TWO MORE COPS throw open the entrance door behind her,
text: HANDGUNS ready. PATIENCE, cornered, looks shocked and
text: betrayed. She raises her hands timidly.
text: LONE removes his shades -- we now see he has a nasty BLACK
text: EYE, his face swollen. Still, a hint of regret in his voice:
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Patience Price, AKA Catwoman, you're under arrest.
dialog: You have the right to remain silent...

dialog: cut TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
text: PATIENCE is in a JAIL JUMPSUIT, alone in a small, dingy room

dialog: You're being charged with vandalism, burglary and
dialog: the murder of Doctor Ivan Nevski --
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: He was dead when... um, Ivan who?
text: (a beat, floundering)
dialog: You, you have no proof that I -- what are you
dialog: doing?
text: LONE is unbuttoning his shirt. He pulls down one side to
text: reveal his shoulder.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: These scratches were inflicted last night by
dialog: Catwoman. Forensics also tested this scratch --
text: He turns around to show the claw-mark she left when they
text: kissed. He turns to face her, rebuttoning his shirt.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: They were made by the same implement.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: So this whole time, you've been flirting, buying me
dialog: dinner, acting like you were interested -- I was a
dialog: suspect? It was just some cat and mouse thing?
text: LONE's a little offended, his tone becomes more aggrieved:
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: No, not at first -- I really bought the act,
dialog: vulnerable girl all alone in the big city --
speaker_heading: PATIENCE

speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Look, I didn't want to believe it, but --

dialog: I guess a strong woman can be intimidating to a
dialog: certain kind of man --
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Did you really think I wasn't gonna recognize you
dialog: in a little mask? I'm not blind.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: So if they don't need rescuing,
dialog: you better lock them up yourself --
text: They're now talking over each other, sounding just like
dialog: bickering
text: lovers. LONE glances at the mirror, embarrassed;
text: they're obviously being watched. Through his teeth:
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Knock it off.
dialog: (flat, Sgt. Friday)

speaker_heading: PATIENCE

text: MEMBERS SCREAM and duck for cover as --
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! CATWOMAN SHOOTS GEORGES in the chest, he
text: collapses, dead instantly.
text: CATWOMAN throws down the gun and sprints behind an ALTAR
text: SCREEN and out of the church.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
text: THE DARK MERCEDES, with only ONE HEADLIGHT, and a DENTED
text: FRONT END, weaves quickly around slower traffic.
scene_heading: INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT
text: CATWOMAN drives like a maniac, looking over her shoulder.
text: She lets out a sudden WHOOP of delight -- she did it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She hits a SPEED-DIAL button, we hear a phone RINGING as she
text: PEELS off the CAT MASK -- and a WIG... it's LAUREL AVENAL.
scene_heading: We hear XAVIER'S VOICE:
speaker_heading: XAVIER (V.O.) (FILTER)
dialog: Are we on?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Oh honey, we are so on.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
scene_heading: CHAOS, PARAMEDICS, COPS, a FORENSICS TEAM photographing
text: George's corpse. Nearby, other COPS bag the HANDGUN.
text: TOM LONE is here, on his cell phone, heading for the exit.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Yeah, we got a couple dozen witnesses, it was
text: Catwoman. Looks like it might be the same weapon
dialog: that killed Nevski...
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
text: LONE moves outside, past FILM TRUCKS outside this urban
text: church, still on the phone.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Nah, couldn't have been Price after all, musta been
dialog: a lab error. You better cut her loose right away
dialog: or she's gonna have a hell of a lawsuit on her
dialog: hands... yeah, be there soon, I just gotta tie up a
text: couple loose ends.
text: He climbs in his sedan and moves off.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - NIGHT
text: LONE'S SEDAN pulls up near the entrance to the office tower.
text: As he gets out, he hears a CHOPPER coming in overhead and
dialog: looks up to see --
text: The AVENAL BEAUTY sign high above, a TWIN-ROTOR CHOPPER
text: approaching the helipad.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: LONE moves toward the showroom entrance, tries the door --
text: locked. He sees the entrance to the PARKING GARAGE, moves
text: down the ramp.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - NIGHT
text: THE MILITARY CARGO CHOPPER touches down. XAVIER and FOUR
text: MERCENARIES emerge. Two mercs carry ALUMINUM SUITCASES, all
text: are armed with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. In addition to chopper
text: SOUNDS, there's a WHISTLING WIND up here and the WHITE NOISE
text: ROAR of A.C. DUCTS.
text: LAUREL, still in the cat suit but without the mask, is
text: waiting. XAVIER approaches, a small BRIEFCASE in hand.
text: Laurel's manner is cold, professional, all business -- she
dialog: couldn't be more different from the victimized female we met
dialog: up here at the outset.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Your husband?
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: He won't be a problem. Ever again. And I'm not
dialog: even a suspect.
text: She gestures to her outfit. Xavier nods.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: American women. I'm always impressed.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Let's do some business.
text: They head down the stairs. CAMERA MOVES, off the roof, to
text: the roof of an adjacent, lower SKYSCRAPER -- and finds --
scene_heading: EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: THE REAL CATWOMAN. She paces, breathing hard, steeling
text: herself for something, looking toward the Avenal building.
text: A WINDOW WASHER RIG hangs halfway down the building, but it's
text: quite a distance from this roof edge.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I can do this... right?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She's addressing MIDNIGHT, who non-commitally licks a paw.
text: CATWOMAN moves to the far end of the roof and sprints toward
text: the edge, leaps for all she's worth --
text: CATWOMAN sails through the air in a perfect arc, toward the
text: window-washer rig... but she's going to fall short and plunge
text: twenty stories. At the last second, she pulls out her whip
dialog: and snaps it out around --
dialog: -- the cables of the rig.
text: CATWOMAN SLAMS HARD against the side of the building,
text: dangling from the whip.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Ow.
text: She struggles to pull herself upward.
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: An ALUMINUM SUITCASE opens -- STACKS of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.
text: WIDER, WESLEY handles the suitcase. He starts to count the
text: stacks of money, testing random bills with a COUNTERFEIT PEN.
text: Meanwhile, Xavier's MERCS are moving aside the LADDERS and
text: PAINT CANS. One yanks down the frilly DRAPERIES to reveal --
text: CANISTERS OF YP-3, dozens of them in a cutout portion of
text: wall, more than we've seen before. Laurel's been hiding them
text: here all along. Xavier opens his briefcase -- there's a
text: TESTING KIT inside.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: May I?
text: So saying, XAVIER plucks a WHITE ROSE from an arrangement.
text: He seals it into a clear PLASTIC CONTAINER, moves to a
text: random canister, and attaches a NOZZLE tightly to the
text: VALVE. Cautiously, he releases a small amount of
text: PRESSURIZED LIQUID into the container.
text: CLOSE -- as the MIST makes contact with the ROSE, the PETALS
text: turn PINK, then RED BLOTCHES appear. Abruptly, the petals
text: BLACKEN, WITHER and ULCERATE. The flower is a shriveled mess
dialog: in seconds.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Nice.
text: XAVIER carefully removes the nozzle, nodding appreciatively
text: at the canisters.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Avenal should think about getting out of cosmetics
dialog: altogether -- chemical weapons are a growth
dialog: industry.
text: THE MERCS, with slightly nervous looks, begin carefully
text: moving the canisters out of the penthouse, up the stairs to
dialog: the helicopter.
text: THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN -- it's ANGEL.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Look what I found.
text: He lifts the semi-conscious LONE from the floor -- the man's
text: been bound, gagged and blindfolded with DUCT TAPE, there's a
text: bruise on his head.
text: ANGEL flashes LONE'S BADGE.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: He's a cop. Found him sniffing around the
dialog: basement.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Oh beautiful.
dialog: (waving a hand)
dialog: Put him in there for now...
text: Angel drags LONE into a CLOSET near the make-up mirror,
text: shoves him inside and closes the door.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: What are we going to do about this?
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: (a shrug)
dialog: I'll be flying over water. I could drop him off.
text: Laurel nods and smiles gratefully.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - NIGHT
text: AT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING, CATWOMAN holds a button on the
text: WINDOW WASHER'S RIG, which rises toward the roof.
dialog: 107.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - NIGHT
text: THE MERCS methodically move canisters from the penthouse, up
text: the stairs, to the CHOPPER on the helipad, where a PILOT
text: waits at the controls -- the ROTOR BLADES spin lazily.
text: MERCENARY #1, winded, calls to the PILOT, who's absorbed in a
text: copy of SOLDIER OF FORTUNE:
speaker_heading: MERCENARY #1
dialog: Wanna pitch in?
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Not my job.
text: MERCENARY #1 exchanges a look with MERCENARY #2, shakes his
text: head, deposits his canister in the chopper. As he moves back
text: for the stairs he hears moving HYDRAULICS. He heads toward
text: the far edge of the helipad, WEAPON ready. He sees the
text: MOVING CABLES of the window washing rig come to a STOP, he
text: looks cautiously over the edge...
text: HIS POV -- the PLATFORM has come to a stop just a few feet
text: below the rooftop. But it's empty.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE -- CATWOMAN is clawing her way around the
text: corner of the building, just below a narrow CORNICE. She's
text: dangling precipitously over a forty story fall.
text: She approaches a WINDOW into the PENTHOUSE below the helipad.
text: CATWOMAN POV -- on LAUREL in the CATWOMAN suit, chatting with
text: XAVIER while the MERCS ferry YP-3.
text: ON CATWOMAN, her eyes widen with the realization -- Laurel?!
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: You cow...
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: WESLEY slips a few BUNDLES of BILLS into his pocket and
text: CLOSES an ALUMINUM CASE.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: It's all here. I've taken my cut.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: All right, Wesley.
text: LAUREL opens a HUMIDOR, offering a CIGAR to Xavier:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Shall we?
text: XAVIER takes a cigar, sniffs it. With mock concern:
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Cuban. Aren't these illegal?
text: They both chuckle as they head out to the garden area.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - NIGHT
text: MERCENARIES #3 and #4 are in the back of the chopper,
text: securing the canisters. #1 and #2 head toward the stairs,
dialog: for another load.
text: MERCENARY #1, in the rear, passes a low A.C. DUCT. THE
text: WHIP LASHES out from behind him, wraps around his throat
text: -- he can't cry out as it YANKS him back behind the duct. We
text: hear a nasty THUNK. One down.
text: ON THE STAIRS, MERCENARY #2 turns around.
speaker_heading: MERCENARY #2
dialog: Tony...?
text: No sign of his buddy. He moves back up the stairs and --
text: -- GETS HIT IN THE FACE with Merc #1's GUN BUTT. He rolls
text: down the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE GARDEN - NIGHT
text: XAVIER and LAUREL have their backs to the stairs, SMOKING
text: their CIGARS, as the unconscious MERCENARY hits the ground a
text: short distance behind them. They don't notice. Laurel
text: stretches her arms luxuriously, enjoying the feel of the
text: wind. Xavier studies Laurel, a bit lasciviously.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Free at last... to eat what I want, wear what I
dialog: want, look like a slob if I want... You have no
dialog: idea how good it feels.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: I was thinking after this business is over, you
dialog: might spend some time with me on my island --
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Thanks, no. I'm through with men.
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - NIGHT
text: MERCENARIES #3 and #4 emerge from the chopper, looking around
text: for the others. As they start to circle the chopper --
text: -- CATWOMAN swings around from behind them, hanging from the
text: slowly spinning ROTOR BLADE, she KICKS THEM BOTH from behind
text: and sends them flying head-first to the asphalt.
text: Merc #3 is knocked cold, Merc #4 rolls over on the ground,
text: FIRING A BURST behind him. But when the blade comes around
text: again, she's gone. He has no idea what hit them.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE GARDEN - NIGHT
text: LAUREL and XAVIER both react to the GUNFIRE, dropping their
text: cigars, hurrying for the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - NIGHT
text: THE PILOT leaps out, a HANDGUN ready.
speaker_heading: PILOT
dialog: What the hell are you shooting at?
speaker_heading: MERCENARY #4
dialog: I don't know!
text: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHOPPER, CATWOMAN clings to the
text: FUSELAGE. Seeing a FUEL TANK --
text: CLOSE -- her CLAW pierces the ALUMINUM SKIN and FUEL starts
text: to spurt out.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE GARDEN - NIGHT
text: WESLEY and ANGEL have emerged from the penthouse, alarmed,
text: just as LAUREL and XAVIER nearly trip over the groaning
scene_heading: MERCENARY #2.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: What the hell --?
text: Xavier takes the man's AUTOMATIC WEAPON, he and Laurel hurry
text: up to the helipad.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - NIGHT
text: LAUREL and XAVIER reach the top of the stairs, followed by
text: WESLEY and ANGEL, just as --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: CATWOMAN leaps down to the penthouse level from the helipad.
text: The group is stunned to see the injured men. MERCENARY #1 is
text: crawling out from behind the A.C. DUCT. LAUREL angrily grabs
text: a MACHINE GUN from the dazed MERCENARY #3. To Xavier:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Where did you find these clowns?!
text: MERCENARY #4 and ANGEL scout the helipad's perimeter, guns at
text: the ready. WESLEY nervously backs toward the stairs.
speaker_heading: WESLEY
dialog: If it's all right with you, Laurel, I'd just as
dialog: soon be going...
text: Xavier is looking around frantically.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: These are good soldiers. It would take a team of
dialog: men --
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Or one woman.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN (0.S.)
dialog: Look what I found!
dialog: All spin to see --
text: CATWOMAN standing at the edge of the helipad, above the sheer
text: drop, holding THE TWO SUITCASES out to either side of her.
text: She has a lit CIGAR clenched between her teeth. Behind her,
text: the SKY is LIGHTENING with approaching dawn.
text: ALL GUNS are trained on Catwoman, except Laurel's.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Don't shoot, you idiots! She'll drop the money--
text: They don't lower their guns. Catwoman narrows her eyes,
text: speaks around the cigar.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Henchmen, Laurel? How tacky.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She jerks one of the cases -- the latch has been loosened, it
text: POPS OPEN and CASH GOES FLYING into the wind --
text: DRIFTING from the rooftop to the city streets below.
text: LAUREL reacts in agony.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: No, please-- don't do that again!
text: CATWOMAN drops the emptied case and pulls the cigar from her
text: mouth with a distasteful expression. Eying Laurel:
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Don't you hate it when somebody shows up at a party
dialog: wearing the same dress?
text: LAUREL advances on Catwoman.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Let's face it -- we're alike, you and me.
text: Catwoman ignores her, shouts to XAVIER and his men:
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: You guys gotta be careful with this YP-3 stuff.
dialog: It's a living thing, you know, a bacteria. If it
dialog: gets too hot -- it dies.
text: XAVIER looks from Catwoman to the FUEL pooling on the
text: helipad, putting two and two together. He jerks his head at
text: his mercs -- they start backing away toward the stairs.
text: LAUREL is still focused on the money.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Let's split the rest of the money -- and there's
dialog: more where that came from --
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Tempting offer... We would make a pretty good team.
text: Beyond the law, fighting the yoke of male
dialog: oppression, sisters under the skin...
text: LAUREL nods hopefully. CATWOMAN looks thoughtfully at the
text: cigar in her hand.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Nah, I still have to live with myself.
text: So saying, she flicks the LIT CIGAR to the helipad --
dialog: IGNITING the spreading pool of gasoline --
text: XAVIER ET AL. sprint to LEAP OFF THE HELIPAD or CHARGE DOWN
dialog: THE STAIRS as --
text: THE HELICOPTER EXPLODES in a glorious FIREBALL.
text: LAUREL is thrown across the helipad by the BLAST, showered
text: with CHOPPER DEBRIS. The men are hightailing it out of
text: there, but Laurel gets slowly to her feet, machine gun
text: ready, bent on revenge.
text: Spotting CATWOMAN darting through the SMOKE and FLAMES toward
text: the stairs, LAUREL FIRES a volley with a SCREAM of rage and
text: charges after her in pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE GARDEN - DAWN
text: LAUREL hurries down the stairs to the garden, FIRING at --
text: CATWOMAN, as she darts into the penthouse. Catwoman's nearly
text: hit, showered with broken glass.
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - LAUREL'S PENTHOUSE - DAWN
text: The roof CREAKS ominously, the room is thick with SMOKE.
text: LAUREL charges in, sees movement near THE ELEVATOR and FIRES
text: A BODY goes down with a CRY. LAUREL laughs triumphantly,
dialog: moves to find --
text: ANGEL, dead on the floor. LAUREL winces.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Sorry, Angel.
text: CATWOMAN leaps at Laurel from behind, the GUN goes flying.
text: The two women CRASH into the CLASSICAL SCULPTURES, shattering
text: them in the course of their struggle. Laurel keeps going for
text: the gun, but Catwoman won't let her get near it.
dialog: 113.
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - SHOWROOM - DAWN

text: They've almost made it out the exit to safety when an EERIE
text: HOWL erupts --
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: What is tha --
text: MIDNIGHT leaps onto his back, sinking his fangs in. A beat
text: later, DOZENS of EDNA'S CATS attack the men; they scream as
text: they try to pry frenzied felines from their flesh.
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE - DAY
text: CATWOMAN and LAUREL continue their battle. Catwoman gets
text: Laurel down, near victory, when -- BEAMS OF SUNLIGHT from the
text: window penetrate the SMOKE and catch CATWOMAN full in the
text: face. She backs away, squinting, disoriented -- this gives
dialog: Laurel the chance to recover.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: No -- I need more time --
text: WHAM! LAUREL gets in a devastating BLOW that sends CATWOMAN
text: reeling. At the same moment, LONE KICKS OPEN the CLOSET
text: DOOR. He's still gagged and blindfolded, hands and feet
text: bound, but he's struggling, GRUNTING now.
text: CATWOMAN takes this in, shocked. She moves to Lone's side.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: Tom...
text: Laurel picks up the machine gun. FLAMES are spreading from
text: the ceiling, DOWN THE WALLS.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: You know this guy?
text: Catwoman raises a hand, curls her fingers -- but no claws
text: emerge. She looks toward the WINDOW where --
text: -- THE SUN is now fully visible.
text: Laurel strides over and KICKS CATWOMAN away from Lone -- she
text: rolls across the ground helplessly. Laurel casually points
text: the weapon at Lone's head.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: No! Don't do it!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Why not? He's just -- a man.
text: Catwoman starts to rise, LAUREL steps on Lone's throat, the
text: gun still pointed at his head.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Move a muscle and you won't have a date for the
dialog: prom.
text: Catwoman freezes, sits back down again. Laurel smiles.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: It's amazing. We're the stronger sex -- but men
dialog: are like Kryptonite. They make us so weak...
text: She increases her pressure on Lone's throat, he WRITHES,
text: CHOKES. Catwoman sounds just like Patience now.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN / PATIENCE
dialog: Stop it, please -- you'll kill him.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Don't worry, I know exactly how much a man can
dialog: take.
text: Laurel takes her foot off of Lone, he struggles for air. She
text: moves in on Catwoman.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: You know, I was actually starting to admire you.
text: LAUREL CLOCKS HER with the GUN BUTT. CATWOMAN/PATIENCE tries
text: to crawl away, BLOOD at her lips.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: When I think of all the guys I had to... use.
text: WHACK! She BOOTS CATWOMAN in the stomach.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: And there you were, clawing your way up on your
dialog: own. But you let me down.
text: She KICKS her again.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I ask one little favor -- but no, I had to take
dialog: care of Georges myself. And now... this. You've
dialog: ruined everything.
text: She pulls CATWOMAN halfway to her feet and SLUGS her face.
text: LAUREL then GRABS the top of the CAT MASK and YANKS it off --
text: PATIENCE looks up at her weakly, eyes rolling.
text: LAUREL blinks, a shocked double-take, backs away.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: No... it's impossible... you're dead.
text: PATIENCE's crumpled figure recalls the position of her body

speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Oh my God... it was you...
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING
text: OBJECTIVE SHOT, ANGEL near Patience's body. CAMERA MOVES TO

speaker_heading: PATIENCE (V.O.)
dialog: You were behind the wheel that night...
scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE - DAY (PRESENT)
text: PATIENCE leaps at LAUREL with blinding speed, CLAWS OUT.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE/CATWOMAN
dialog: It was you!
text: LAUREL is overwhelmed by the sudden turn. PATIENCE/ CATWOMAN

text: and blows, pushed closer to the flames.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: What do you want, an apology? Of course it was me,
dialog: it was always me -- I ran the YP-3 operation right
dialog: under Georges' nose, I couldn't let some frumpy
dialog: accountant blow the whistle when I was so close --
text: PATIENCE/CATWOMAN slashes at Laurel's head with a HISS -- she
text: peels off HALF LAUREL'S FACE -- it's like a form-fitting
text: “Mission: Impossible" LATEX MASK. Beneath, the skin is
text: BLOTCHED with DARK SPOTS and SORES. LAUREL lets out a
dialog: hideous SCREAM.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: No! My face!
text: PATIENCE/CATWOMAN knocks her to the ground, straddles her.
text: The fight's gone out of LAUREL now, she clutches at her
text: disfigured features. Patience/Catwoman cocks her head,
text: looking at the shredded LATEX hanging from her claws.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE/CATWOMAN
dialog: So I'm not the only one hiding behind a mask.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I was the first to try Beaunique
dialog: -- I was over 30, I had nothing to
dialog: lose. When the symptoms started
dialog: to show, it was too late...
text: As she speaks, Laurel peels away the remains of the LATEX.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE/CATWOMAN
dialog: So you upped production and sold the stuff to an
dialog: arms dealer.
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Life hands you lemons, you make lemonade.
text: A FLAMING BEAM gives way, blocking the STAIRWELL, part of the
text: CEILING collapses -- this gives Laurel the chance to squirm

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: PATIENCE/CATWOMAN runs to Lone's side, pulling him away from

text: LAUREL, meanwhile, opens a hidden COMPARTMENT by her mirror,
text: revealing numerous LATEX MASKS. She begins to apply a new
text: one, using adhesive, smoothing wrinkles, hiding the seams,
text: etc. Nearby, her PORTRAIT starts to MELT and turn to ASH.
text: THE CEILING BUCKLES, chunks of MASONRY falling.

speaker_heading: PATIENCE/CATWOMAN
dialog: Laurel, you better get out of here --
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: In a minute -- I have to finish putting on my face

scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY
text: PATIENCE/CATWOMAN leaps into the open elevator shaft, LONE

scene_heading: INT. AVENAL HQ - LAUREL'S PENTHOUSE - DAY
text: LAUREL is now trapped in the make-up alcove, illuminated by

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: You're still beautiful... you'll always be

speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Who are you?
text: PATIENCE/CATWOMAN hesitates, about to answer -- but instead

scene_heading: EXT. AVENAL HQ - DAY

dialog: Thank you.

dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: A promise is a promise.
text: Her tone is soft, more like Patience's. EDNA takes in the
text: blood on her, her torn clothes.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What happened to you?
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN
dialog: I found out the truth.
text: Edna notes the SUNLIGHT pouring through the window, eyes her.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: But the sun is up... you're still Catwoman?
text: CATWOMAN pulls off the mask and looks at it, puzzled.
speaker_heading: CATWOMAN / PATIENCE
dialog: Yeah. But I'm Patience, too... with or without the
dialog: mask. I don't think there's a difference any more.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Maybe there never really was.
text: CATWOMAN/PATIENCE nods and smiles at this thoughtfully,
text: accepting her dual nature at last.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Filled with CARDBOARD BOXES. MOVING MEN carry a few out.
text: SALLY is ostensibly lending a hand, but is mostly interested
text: in the men's muscles. As she picks up a tiny box --
speaker_heading: SALLY
dialog: You look awfully hot. Sure you don't wanna take
dialog: that shirt off?
text: SALLY winks at PATIENCE as she follows the man out the door.
text: Patience looks good, no trace of the old awkwardness -- she's
text: integrated her cat side. The PHONE RINGS, she snatches it up
text: in a swift, feline fashion.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: LONE (V.0O.)
dialog: (filter)
dialog: Hi, Patience.
text: Patience turns -- LONE stares from his window across the way.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. LONE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: He and Patience maintain eye contact while they speak.
speaker_heading: LONE (V.0O.)
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Moving out?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE (V.O.)
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: You are a good detective. It just feels like time
dialog: for a change.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Where you heading?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Why? You still keeping tabs on me? Said on TV the
dialog: Catwoman case was closed.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Mm. No hard feelings...?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Nah. In a way, it was flattering.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Funny thing, no one at the station remembers
dialog: letting you out of jail.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: That's bureaucracy for you.
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: Hard to believe, Catwoman was Laurel Avenal all
dialog: along.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: Uh-huh. It is pretty hard to believe.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: There's a significant pause, they eye each other across the
text: alley. Lone knows, and Patience knows he knows. In unison:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE LONE
dialog: Thank you -- Thank you --
text: They laugh at this, take a moment to recover. Then:
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Dinner the other night. How about you?
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: For... teaching me some things. Listen, Patience -
dialog: - if you're still interested -- I'd like to get to
dialog: know you better.
text: MIDNIGHT LEAPS UP onto Patience's shoulder, nuzzles her neck.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Hey, you never really know anybody. Not
dialog: completely.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: I guess I had that coming... Look, I know it's not
dialog: simple, I'm a cop and you're...
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
text: A dull accountant.
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: All I'm saying is -- whatever you are, however...
dialog: complicated -- I can deal with it.
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Can you?
speaker_heading: LONE
dialog: I'd like to try. I just don't want this to be
dialog: good-bye.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 122.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PATIENCE
dialog: Oh... I have a feeling we'll see each other again.
text: She HANGS UP, rolls her shoulders and lets out a little PURR.
text: WITH LONE, he smiles, putting the phone down himself as
text: Patience moves away from the window.
text: WITH PATIENCE, MOVE to find the CAT MASK as she places it on
text: top of stacks of slightly FIRE-DAMAGED $100 DOLLAR BILLS and
text: CLOSES THE SUITCASE.
text: CuT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: THE END
