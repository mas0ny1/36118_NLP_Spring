speaker_heading: VICTOR (O.S.)
dialog: Mom, you have to wear the glasses.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: Oh! Yes of course.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Victor's MOM and DAD share the couch with SPARKY THE DOG,

text: Behind them run two projectors, manned by the filmmaker
text: himself, VICTOR. He's more mad scientist than film
dialog: auteur -- he built this twin projector system himself.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: So that's where my candlestick

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh, isn't that your grandmother's

text: BACK TO THE SCREEN
text: The pterodactyl swoops across town. People run in fear

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Oh that is so...Woah! I just felt

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh. That's scary.
text: Troops and tanks spring into action.

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You tell em' Sparky.
text: Sparky defeats the monster and the troops and townsfolk
text: rejoice.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Bravo!
text: Suddenly, one of the projectors JAMS on a splice. The

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh! Oh!

scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 3
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Um. Maybe just unplug it.
text: Sparky YANKS the power cord from the wall. The bulb

text: Darkness for a moment, then Victor flicks on the light
dialog: switch.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Well it certainly was exciting!
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yeah, it was a big finish. Well

speaker_heading: VICTOR

speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know that Victor has

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM HALLWAY - DAY

speaker_heading: DAD (O.S.)
dialog: That's my point! I don't want him

speaker_heading: MOM (O.S)

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY
text: MAIN TITLES begin, as Victor carries the projector up

text: Victor disassembles the projectors, nimbly swapping
text: pieces in and out.
text: Sparky happily trots on a little treadmill Victor

text: frame. He bounds back a second later and tries to get
text: Victor to play with him by licking his face.

dialog: Easy boy.

scene_heading: EXT. TOWN - MORNING
text: Tight on the wheel of the paper boy's bicycle we pull out

text: The town comes complete with its own ersatz Dutch

text: A BIKE-RIDING PAPERBOY delivers the morning news.
scene_heading: EXT. VICTOR'S HOUSE / STREET - MORNING

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Burgemeister!
text: Next-door neighbor BURGEMEISTER is trimming his box

speaker_heading: BURGEMEISTER
dialog: Your dog has been sniffing around

speaker_heading: VICTOR

speaker_heading: BURGEMEISTER
dialog: You better.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Yes sir.
text: Victor continues to walk to the backyard.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Go on Sparky. That's right. Good
dialog: boy.
text: Sparky trots after Victor. Victor puts him in the back

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: See you later!
text: Burgemeister picks up his own newspaper and unfolds it to

scene_heading: INSERT NEWSPAPER: The headline reads "MAYOR

speaker_heading: BURGEMEISTER
dialog: Is that so. What about that dog of

speaker_heading: ELSA
text: She's not in the house and she's

scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: MR. RZYKRUSKI stands at the blackboard, where he's

scene_heading: MR. RZYKRUSKI
dialog: Good morning children. I am Mr.
dialog: Rzykruski. I will be your new
dialog: science teacher. Apparently, Mr.
dialog: Holcum had an incident.
text: Edgar interjects:
speaker_heading: E
text: He got hit by lightning.
text: This is news to Mr. Rzykruski. The rest of the class,
dialog: including Victor and every child we've met so far,
dialog: already knew.
scene_heading: MR. RZYKRUSKI
dialog: Well. That is bad. But he did
dialog: not get "hit by" lightning.
dialog: Lightning does not hit a person,
text: the way one is hit by a baseball
dialog: or a cabbage.
text: On the blackboard, he draws a diagram to illustrate his
text: point, starting with a big cloud.
scene_heading: MR. RZYKRUSKI
dialog: Lightning is simply electricity.
text: The cloud is angry, yes, making
dialog: storm. All the electrons are
dialog: saying, "I am leaving you. I go
dialog: to land of opportunity."
text: He draws the ground beneath it.
scene_heading: MR. RZYKRUSKI
dialog: The ground says, "Yes, we need
dialog: electrons trained in science just
dialog: like you. Come! Come! Welcome!"
text: So both sides start to build a
text: ladder.
dialog: (drawing stick
dialog: figure)
text: This man, he comes out to look at
text: the storm. He does not see the
text: invisible ladders. When the two
dialog: ladders meet, BOOM! The circuit
dialog: is complete and all of the
text: electrons rush to the land of
dialog: opportunity. This man is in the
dialog: way. Yiii!
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 8
text: He draws "shock lines" all around the stick figure. It's
dialog: pretty violent.
text: All of the students are watching in wide-eyed wonder.
text: Realizing that he may have gone overboard...
scene_heading: MR. RZYKRUSKI
dialog: But is very rare to have such
dialog: incident.
text: Victor raises his hand.
speaker_heading: TOSHIAKI
dialog: But it's not rare.
dialog: Lightning happens to people all
dialog: the time here.
text: There's a thunderstorm almost
dialog: every night.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: My dad got hit twice.
speaker_heading: WEIRD GIRL
dialog: They built New Holland on an

speaker_heading: TOSHIAKI

dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 9
text: But "catch" doesn't work too well without Victor and the
text: ball rolls through a broken plank in the bottom of Mr
text: Burgemeister's fence.
text: Assuming it is lost forever, Sparky sits dejectedly
text: looking at the fence until he is startled to see the ball
text: suddenly roll back towards him.
text: He BARKS and goes to investigate.
text: Another dog BARKS BACK.
text: Surprised, Sparky backs off. There's not usually a dog
text: next door.
text: He BARKS.
text: An ANSWERING BARK.
text: He SNIFFS the fence thoroughly. As he reaches the broken
text: plank, his nose touches ANOTHER DOG'S NOSE.
text: He jumps back.
text: Lies low in the grass to peer through.
text: On the other side of the fence is a similarly-sized
text: poodle named PERSEPHONE -- Elsa's dog. She's beautiful.
text: She drops the ball on the grass, staring back.
text: Sparky suddenly rolls over on his back, completely
dialog: submissive.
text: Persephone grabs the ball and runs away.
text: Sparky pops up, looking after her.
scene_heading: INT. CLASS - DAY

speaker_heading: VICTOR

speaker_heading: WEIRD GIRL
dialog: Mr. Whiskers had a dream about you

speaker_heading: WEIRD GIRL
dialog: Because this morning, he made

text: She holds out what looks to be a small rope of dried

speaker_heading: WEIRD GIRL (V.O.)
dialog: ...and Nassor the day he got

text: Nassor, an intense boy with sinister eyes, pulls down a

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL / BIKE RACKS - DAY
speaker_heading: WEIRD GIRL
dialog: If Mr. Whiskers dreams about you,

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You can keep it.
text: The class bell RINGS. Side-stepping around her, Victor

speaker_heading: WEIRD GIRL

scene_heading: EXT. TOWN - DAY

speaker_heading: VICTOR

speaker_heading: E
dialog: You'll be my partner, right,

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 12
speaker_heading: E (CONT'D)
dialog: Because you have to have a partner
dialog: for the science fair and whoever's
dialog: your partner is going to win. You
dialog: know the most about science. So
dialog: pick me as a partner. I have lots
dialog: of ideas. We could make a death
dialog: ray!
text: Victor holds up a permission slip, which lists all the
dialog: prohibited projects, including explosives, lasers,
text: nuclear devices and death rays.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It says no death rays. See?
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Ah, man. I still want to do it.
dialog: (and yet...)
dialog: C'mon. Who else would be your
dialog: partner? You don't have friends
dialog: and neither do I.
text: He has a point. Victor gives in.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I'm sorry Edgar. I just don't need

speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Victor, have I ever talked to you
dialog: about what I do for a living?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You're a travel agent.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I sell dreams. I tell people, you
dialog: can sail to Italy. You can do the

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Will you sign my form?
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: I'm getting to that.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 13
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Okay.
text: Dad picks up two long fondue forks, using them to
dialog: illustrate his point.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: In my job, sometimes you have
dialog: people who don't want quite the
dialog: same thing, right. Say the
dialog: husband wants to play golf in
dialog: Scotland, but the wife wants to
dialog: paddle down the Amazon. Alright
dialog: you've got two conflicting ideas
dialog: here.
dialog: (holding forks apart)
dialog: And it's my job, Victor, to help
dialog: them meet halfway. Say,
text: Scottsdale, Arizona. He gets to
dialog: golf, she gets Indians.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: But there's no river. And no
dialog: jungle.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Nobody gets what they want.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Exactly. And wrong. They both
dialog: get what they want because they
dialog: compromise.
text: Dad skewers meat on his forks, continuing his metaphor.
dialog: Victor is shrimp; Dad is beef.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: You'd like to do this science
dialog: fair. And that's great. I'd like
dialog: you to try a sport. Say, I don't
dialog: know, baseball. Science fair,
dialog: baseball. Science fair, baseball.
dialog: How do you choose? Guess what?
dialog: You don't have to. No reason you
dialog: can't do both. You meet in the

scene_heading: EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Come on honey!
text: Toshiaki pitches again and as Victor swings to hit the

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I don't want him in my heart. I

text: He looks back and forth between Mr. Ryzkruski's
text: demonstration and his doodle of Sparky. An idea.
text: Victor bursts out of the school doors and starts to run
dialog: home.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: Victor runs through the street on his way home.
scene_heading: EXT. VICTOR'S HOUSE - DAY
text: He runs into the garage and grabs a whole lot of tools,
text: gear and equipment.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Victor raids the kitchen for some household appliances.
text: Mom sits on the couch reading and only barely registers
text: what he is up to.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Hi Victor, how was school?
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 19
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Ok.
text: Victor heads upstairs with a box of the appliances he has
dialog: just collected.
scene_heading: EXT. PET CEMETERY - NIGHT
text: A full moon. HOOTING owls.
text: Over the top of the fence, we see a shovel blade moving
dialog: past.
text: The shovel digs into the soft earth. Again. And again.
text: Victor is digging up Sparky's grave. It's tough work,
text: especially because he's trying to be quiet.
text: A black cat perches on a nearby gravestone. SCREECHES.
text: Spooked, Victor waves him off.
text: He's uncovered the box. He opens it and gingerly loads
text: the wrapped bundle into shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Victor's parents are sitting on the couch watching a
text: movie. Though the movie isn't really scary, Mom looks for
text: any excuse to snuggle closer to her husband. He
text: playfully encourages it and puts his arm around her to
text: pull her closer.
text: As Victor sneaks behind them, carrying the wrapped
text: corpse, he inadvertently knocks into a lamp causing it to
dialog: flicker.
text: Dad turns and sees what's back there but can't see Victor
text: who is hiding, frozen, just out of sight.
text: Dad turns back to the TV.
text: Relieved, Victor tiptoes past them, heading for the
dialog: stairs.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: EXTREMELY CLOSE ON the eye of a needle. Thread pushes
dialog: through.
text: Victor is making repairs to Sparky's corpse. We don't
text: see any of it directly, just shadows on the wall.
text: He rummages through a bucket of nuts and screws, picking
text: two oversized bolts.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 20
text: He places Sparky onto Mom's ironing board and pushes it
text: directly under the skylight. The storm is just reaching a
dialog: fever pitch.
text: As HOPEFUL MUSIC rises, Victor climbs a ladder out the
text: window where we see that he has attached his metal swing
text: set to the roof. Victor checks the wind direction and
text: lets fly two balloons attached to the umbrella and
text: fastens the ends to the swing set. This will serve as the
dialog: conductor.
scene_heading: EXT. BURGEMEISTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Burgemeister is drawing his drapes shut when he sees the
text: movement on the Frankenstein roof. He can't make out
text: Victor, but it's enough to make him suspicious.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: Victor climbs down and checks his notes and his
text: equipment.
text: We see a whole host of household items that Victor has re-
text: purposed to become part of his elaborate apparatus.
text: - A series of Mom's colanders and pans and appliances,
dialog: - an old fish tank,
text: - some bobbing Christmas reindeer
text: all serve as unlikely components of his grand experiment.
text: He has also erected a series of pulleys so that he can
text: hoist Sparky up through the sky light.
text: Victor can hear the storm raging and knows that it is now
text: or never. He pets Sparky's lifeless form one last time
dialog: for courage.
text: He turns to an old Schwinn bicycle mounted on a stand and
text: starts the wheels spinning. One by one the appliances
text: start to whir and come alive.
text: Victor then begins to hoist Sparky up through the sky
text: light. The rain is beating down and the lightning is
text: getting more intense.
text: The metal table finally reaches his resting spot under
text: the swing set.
text: Now all he can do is wait. He watches the storm intently,
text: silently urging Zeus' thunderbolts to strike.
dialog: And then...
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 21
dialog: CRACK!
text: A jagged finger of light touches the top of the balloons,
text: racing down the cord and into the attic -
text: Zapping Sparky with a thousand volts.
text: Victor removes his goggles, and springs right to action
text: cranking down the metal table, eager to see if it worked.
text: All of the appliances power down and grind to a halt. The
text: room goes silent.
text: He swings the table over to the workbench.
text: Wearing a stethoscope, he listens for a heartbeat.
text: Hearing nothing, he keeps checking. But he eventually
text: realizes it has all been for naught.
text: He lays his head down on the workbench, letting out
text: exhausted, sniffly tears.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I'm sorry, boy.
text: A beat.
text: As a single tear drips onto Sparky's lifeless form, we
text: hear a final spark and then...
text: His TAIL starts to move and -
text: His TONGUE licks Victor face.
text: Victor sits up, bewildered. It's Sparky, still half-
text: wrapped in the blanket.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You're alive! You're alive!
dialog: Sparky! You're Alive! I can't
dialog: believe it you're alive!
text: Sparky can't control how happy he is and knocks Victor to
text: the group. He enthusiastically licks his face and wags
text: his tail so excitedly that it flies clear across the
text: room. For a moment, he looks worried but Victor just
text: laughs.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I can fix that.
text: Victor and Sparky play on the attic floor excited to be
dialog: back together.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It worked. It really worked.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 22
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY
text: Victor is sleeping on the floor, sharing a blanket with
dialog: Sparky.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: Victor!
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Victor's Mom opens the door to find Victor's bed empty.
dialog: Pretty sure where he must be...
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Victor! Breakfast!
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY
text: Sparky licks Victor's face waking him up. He sits up,
text: rubbing his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC STAIRS- DAY
text: Mom is walking up the stairs to the attic looking for
dialog: Victor.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Victor? Are you up here?
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY
text: Victor hears his Mom climbing the steps and panics.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Ssssh! Quiet down boy! Ssssh!
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: Victor?
text: Victor picks up Sparky and carries him around a curtain
text: to the back of the attic.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sparky! Sssh! Quiet.
text: Mom enters but can't see Victor and Sparky behind the
dialog: curtain.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: Victor?
text: Looking around for somewhere to hide Sparky, Victor
text: finally grabs a big tin bucket and puts it over Sparky
dialog: just as -
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 23
text: Mom pulls the curtain back.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: French toast or waffles?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Waffles.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Then I'll need my waffle iron
dialog: back, Mr. Director.
text: Spotting her waffle iron amid the leftover set
text: decoration, she heads right for Sparky. The bucket
text: suddenly moves, shifting away.
text: She looks at Victor. Thinking quick:
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It's my science project. It's a
dialog: robot.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: A robotic bucket?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: For mopping, I suppose.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Then maybe when you're finished,
dialog: you'll let me use it.
text: She takes her waffle iron and heads back downstairs.
text: Victor closes the curtain, then lifts the bucket off
dialog: Sparky.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sorry, boy, but I can't let anyone
dialog: know about you. They may not
dialog: understand. So you need to stay
dialog: here today.
text: Victor kisses Sparky and heads out of the attic.
text: Sparky rests his head on his paws, dejected.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 24
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - DAY
text: Victor walks down the sidewalk to school. He looks up at
text: the open attic window, nervous to be leaving Sparky
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: BURGEMEISTER
dialog: Watch it, there!
text: Victor stops, realizing he's stepped off the sidewalk,
text: and has almost nudged the edge of one of Burgemeister's
text: tulips.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
text: Burgemeister glares at him suspiciously. He doesn't trust
text: this kid and suspects that something weird is going on.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY [LATER]
text: Mom is vacuuming while reading a book. She's quite
text: practiced at it.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY
text: Sparky is drinking from his water bowl. As he does,
text: water leaks from his seams.
text: He hears a LONG MEOW.
text: It's Mr. Whiskers, Weird Girl's Cat and it's perched in
text: the open attic window.
text: Sparky BARKS at it.
text: Mom switches off the vacuum. Did she hear barking?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: No. Couldn't be.
text: She starts up the vacuum again.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY
text: Sparky jumps up on a chair, then onto the workbench.
dialog: Lunges for the cat --
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE / ROOF - DAY
text: -- and goes right through the window. He lands on the
text: steeply-sloped roof and slides down the shingles,
dialog: falling...
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 25
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: ...right past the picture window. Fortunately, Mom is so
text: engrossed in her book that she doesn't see him and she
text: continues her vacuuming.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - DAY
text: Sparky lands in the driveway and Mr Whiskers watches him
text: from on top of the car. When he moves to make a run for
text: it, Sparky is in hot pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. BURGEMEISTER'S YARD - DAY
text: Sparky chases the cat through the tulips, smashing them.
text: Mr Whiskers bounds on top of one of Mr. Burgemeister's
text: flamingos and thinks he is safely out of Sparky's reach.
text: He smugly starts to groom himself, but the single
text: standing leg starts to buckle. The flamingo collapses
text: into a heap, spilling the cat onto the perfectly
text: manicured flowers, destroying everything.
text: The cat and Sparky run past the house and into the
text: neighbor's backyard just as Mr Burgemeister looks out the
text: window to see his destroyed garden.
scene_heading: EXT BOB'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Mr Whiskers leaps onto a garbage can, and clambers up
text: onto the roof to safety.
text: Sparky unable to follow is distracted by a fly buzzing
text: around the knocked over garbage can. He gulps it down and
text: then suddenly stops. He feels a funny tickle in his
text: throat, neck and tummy before the fly emerges from the
text: stitches on his side.
text: Sparky continues to chase the fly into Bob's yard where
text: Bob's Mom is hanging out the laundry.
text: As she turns, she sees Sparky's shadow cast on a bed
text: sheet. The shadow is double his size and his teeth look
text: huge. Bob's Mom thinks it's a hideous monster and runs
text: screaming into the house.
speaker_heading: BOB'S MOTHER
dialog: What! *screams*
text: Sparky can't understand why she is so upset but he just
text: heads out on his way.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 26
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET / SIDEWALK - DAY
text: Two MOMS sit on a park bench talking, while their
text: toddlers nap in their strollers.
speaker_heading: FIRST WOMAN
dialog: I know, and Helen said she thought
dialog: he was putting up some kind of tv
dialog: antenna on top of the roof!
speaker_heading: SECOND WOMAN
dialog: In the middle of a thunderstorm?
speaker_heading: FIRST WOMAN
dialog: That's what she said!
text: Neither mother notices as Sparky trots up. One of the
text: babies starts to fall asleep and drops his pacifier on
text: the floor.
scene_heading: SECOND MOTHER
dialog: And did you get that big power
dialog: surge in the night? Jack thought
text: it was a fuse box but apparently
dialog: it effected the whole
dialog: neighbourhood.
text: The baby looks round and sees Sparky guilelessly sucking
text: on the pacifier.
speaker_heading: SECOND MOTHER (O.S.)
dialog: Sometimes I wonder just what goes
dialog: on in that house. I just don't
dialog: feel safe walking by there.
text: Seeing Sparky up close, the baby is horrified. It
text: SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: FIRST WOMAN
dialog: Sweetie are you ok? Here you go.
text: Sparky hides under the bench out of sight as the first
text: woman tries to calm her little one and pops the pacifier
text: back in the babies mouth.
scene_heading: SECOND MOTHER
dialog: So anyway Jack loves it here but
dialog: if the schools weren't so great
dialog: sometimes I wonder if we would be
dialog: better of...
text: Both Mommies get up and start to walk away they don't
text: notice Sparky cowering under the bench.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 27
scene_heading: EXT. NEAR THE SCHOOL - DAY
text: Sparky trots past the front of the school as the school
text: bell rings. Sparky heads for the garbage cans around the
dialog: back.
text: On his way home, E walks behind the cafeteria and sees
text: Sparky sniffing around the garbage cans. He can't believe
text: his eyes.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Sparky?
text: Sparky stops short and looks right at E before running
text: off home.
text: E's eyes narrow. Isn't Sparky supposed to be dead?
text: We end on a shot of E, hatching a plan.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
text: Sparky arrives home and heads straight to the backyard
text: fence to see if Persephone is around.
text: Seeing that she is, he peeks his head through the broken
text: slates. Persephone is overjoyed but she seems to know
text: that there's something different about him.
text: Sparky is so excited to see her he pushes his head
text: through the hole and gets his bolts stuck on the fence.
text: Persephone comes over to get a closer look and sniffs at
text: him cautiously. He smells a little funny but he seems to
text: be the same old Sparky until she focuses on the bolts
text: sticking out of his neck. Cautiously, she licks one, and
dialog: gets
speaker_heading: ZAPPED!
text: The force of the spark sends Sparky back through the
text: fence and into his own yard. Persephone is thrown clear
text: across her garden. As she woozily gets back up, she turns
dialog: and we see that she now has a Bride of Frankenstein
dialog: stripe in her hair!
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - DAY
text: Victor cycles home after school. He throws his bike on
text: the lawn and heads straight inside.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Mom is lying on the couch, reading one of her books.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 28
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Hi Victor. How was school?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: GoodGottaGo.
text: He's heads up the stairs just as Sparky walks through the
text: front door, following a few steps behind.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY
text: Victor enters the attic, looking for...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sparky?
text: Hearing no answer, he walks in further. He checks behind
text: the curtain.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sparky?
text: Slight panic creeps into Victor's voice before Sparky
text: sneaks in behind him and nudges his leg.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: There you are. Good boy!
text: Relieved, Victor kneels down and pets him lovingly.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sorry you had to stay here alone
dialog: all day.
text: Sparky just keeps panting, not revealing a thing. He
text: starts to slow down coming to a rest at Victor feet.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What's the matter boy? Are you ok?
dialog: Hmmm. You're a little low. Are
dialog: you hungry, boy?
text: Sparky sighs.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Alright, here lets top you up.
text: Victor runs an extension cord from the wall and clips
text: them to Sparky's bolts. As he switches the plug on,
text: Sparky's eyes glow a bit. Sparky brightens up and barks.
speaker_heading: MOM (O.S.)
dialog: Victor! Could you come down here
dialog: please?
text: Victor switches the plug off and heads downstairs.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 29
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN- DAY
text: Victor is taken by surprise as enters the kitchen to find
text: Edgar sitting at the counter. Edgar looks particularly
text: smug as Mom is busies herself in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Victor your friend is here.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Edgar?
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Edgar. What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: E
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: E
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Know what?
speaker_heading: E
dialog: You know.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: I think I know what you know I
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Look, I don't know what you think
dialog: I know, but I don't know it.
text: Mom exits the kitchen and Edgar leans in, barely able to
text: hide his excitement.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Your dog is alive.
text: Victor looks shocked and checks to see if Mom has gone.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: That's impossible.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: I know. I know it is so impossible
dialog: but you did it. You did it.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 30
text: Victor stalls, trying to think of an explanation.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: So show me how, or I'll tell
dialog: everyone. Oh Mrs Frankenstein...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Ssssh!
text: Mom comes back into the kitchen.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: .. May I have a cookie please?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Oh- yes. Of course.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Alright. Come on.
text: Victor reluctantly agrees and beckons Edgar to follow him
text: up to the attic.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY
text: Sparky and E watch as Victor draws his findings on the
text: chalkboard for E. It's a mess of symbols and variables,
text: all connected by arrows.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I think the wind and the lightning
dialog: are part of the same thing, some
dialog: kind of strange force. But the
dialog: wind isn't strong enough to bring
text: an animal back from the dead. For
dialog: that, you need lightning.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: So when can I do it?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You can't. This isn't an
dialog: experiment. It's my dog.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Show and tell Victor: you show me
dialog: and I won't tell.
scene_heading: INT. PET STORE - DAY
text: E stares into a tank of swimming goldfish, the PET STORE
text: OWNER appears next to him.
scene_heading: PET STORE OWNER
dialog: Can I help you young man?
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 31
speaker_heading: E
dialog: I'd like to buy a fish.
scene_heading: PET STORE OWNER
dialog: Certainly. Which one?
speaker_heading: E
dialog: This one.
text: He points to one floating belly-up at the top of the
dialog: tank.
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - NIGHT
text: E plops the dead fish into a small jar of water, already
text: attached to electrodes and the metal table.
text: Victor and E crank the gears, opening the roof to the
text: stormy night sky. The table rises into position as the
text: lightning rod telescopes out.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: What do we do now?
text: Victor grabs E and throws him to the floor. Sparky finds
text: cover behind a mirror.
text: CRACK! BOOM!
text: The table cranks back down into the attic. The roof
text: doors fold shut. Victor and E race over to the jar.
text: CLOSE ON E as he looks into the little jar.
text: The fish is gone.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: What happened to it? What did you
dialog: do?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I don't know. It should have
dialog: worked.
text: Victor leans in to look close. Suddenly, the water
text: ripples. A PLOP.
text: Then the jar RATTLES AROUND on its rim, knocked about
text: from within.
text: Victor finds a steampunk-ish flashlight with different
text: lenses that spin in front of the bulb.
text: As he holds it close to the jar, we see what appears to
text: be a transperant fish skeleton swimming around.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 32
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: (in wonderment)
text: It's invisible. It's an invisible
dialog: goldfish.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Why is it invisible?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I have no idea.
text: Sparky growls at the jar.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
text: The nightly storm has ended. It's now just a bit of
text: distant RUMBLING.
text: E is carrying the jar with the invisible goldfish.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You can't tell anyone. You
dialog: understand that, right? Not until
dialog: we figure out how it works.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Okay! Okay!
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Promise.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Promise.
text: We see E crossing his fingers behind his back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BOB'S GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Toshiaki and Bob stand in the door way of the garage
text: examining E's jar with healthy skepticism.
speaker_heading: TOSHIAKI
dialog: How are we supposed to see an
dialog: invisible goldfish?
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Put your finger in. You can feel
dialog: it.
text: Toshiaki and Bob trade a look -- this feels like a prank.
text: But with a shrug, Bob does.
text: Nothing. He swirls his finger around.
dialog: January 2012
scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 33
dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Aaah!
text: He yanks his finger out.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: It bit me.
speaker_heading: TOSHIAKI
dialog: Let me see it.
text: Toshiaki takes the jar from E. He walks over to a table
text: and places the jar down. He shines a table lamp through
dialog: the jar.
text: The invisible goldfish casts a shadow on the wall. In
text: the shadow, you can see it actually has Jurassic-sized
dialog: teeth. It's pretty scary.
speaker_heading: TOSHIAKI/BOB
speaker_heading: *GASP*
text: Toshiaki turns off the lamp and takes a closer look at
dialog: the jar.
text: E takes the jar back. Screws on the lid.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: It's my science project and it's
dialog: top secret.
text: Toshiaki looks over to Bob and gives him a flick of the
text: head. Bob takes the hint and starts to push E out of the
dialog: garage.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, well, our science fair
dialog: project is even cooler.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: TOSHIAKI
dialog: Double top secret.

speaker_heading: TOSHIAKI
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You're the smart one.
speaker_heading: TOSHIAKI
dialog: I know!
text: A long beat.
text: Toshiaki's eyes narrow. He stares at Bob and his gaze
text: then moves to the poster above Bob's head, it's a Rocket
text: Poster. Toshiaki has an idea.
scene_heading: TRANSITION TO:
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY
text: Sparky is desperate to play with Victor in the attic.

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Ok, ok, sit still. Ssssh! Sparky.
dialog: No! Sssh. No! Sssh.
text: Victor ties up Sparky.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sorry, boy. But we can't risk

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Ssssh!

speaker_heading: NASSOR

speaker_heading: E
dialog: I didn't say that. Who said I

speaker_heading: NASSOR
dialog: Toshiaki says it's your science

speaker_heading: E
dialog: If it was, I couldn't tell you.
speaker_heading: NASSOR
dialog: So it isn't? Or it is?
speaker_heading: E
dialog: No. Yes. I'm confused.
speaker_heading: NASSOR
dialog: Do you have an invisible fish?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Okay. But you have to keep it a
dialog: secret.
text: He unzips his school bag, pulling out the jar of water.
text: Unscrews the lid.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Swish your finger around. You can
dialog: feel it.
text: Nassor dips his finger in the water, swirling it around.
speaker_heading: NASSOR
text: It's just water. There's nothing
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: No, it's invisible?

speaker_heading: E
dialog: *Gasp*
text: A beat.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: E runs as fast as he can with his jar outstretched in

dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Victor! Something's wrong with my
dialog: fish.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: E
text: It's not there anymore.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Maybe it just hopped out. Did you
dialog: have the lid on?
speaker_heading: E
dialog: Yes! Ever since...since I left
dialog: your house. I mean, it was there
dialog: when I went to bed.
text: Victor ponders the possibilities.
speaker_heading: E
dialog: I'm thinking, maybe they don't

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC WORKSHOP - DAY

scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 37

text: A BARK.
text: Victor turns to find Sparky drinking out of his bowl.
text: He scratches his ear and it falls off.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (O.S.)
dialog: Sparky!
text: Victor rushes over to him. Sparky's not sure what all the

dialog: lost ear.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Oh! Don't worry. I can fix that
dialog: too.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 38
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: TOSHIAKI

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: TOSHIAKI

scene_heading: ANOTHER MOTHER

text: Not winning them over.
scene_heading: MR. RZYKRUSKI
dialog: You do not understand science, so

speaker_heading: ELSA
dialog: Victor?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Hi, Elsa. What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ELSA

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ELSA
text: I heard a bark.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Yeah that was me.
speaker_heading: ELSA

speaker_heading: VICTOR
text: *Victor pretends to bark and howl*
text: Elsa steps back from the fence.
speaker_heading: ELSA

speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Actually I have a question.
scene_heading: MR. RZYKRUSKI

speaker_heading: VICTOR

scene_heading: MR. RZYKRUSKI

speaker_heading: DAD
