text: NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE
text: NUMBERS, AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE
text: BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. SNOWSCAPE
text: A BLINDING WHITE SCREEN, under which we hear an ominous
text: low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. We're not in 19"
text: television land anymore, Toto. As the rumble builds, TWO
text: BLACK FIGURES appear on what now has resolved into a
text: distant horizon. From their movements we can shortly see
text: that the figures are men. Moving along a windswept ice
text: sheet in an otherwise featureless land.
text: A LEGEND appears: NORTH TEXAS, 35,000 B.C.
scene_heading: CLOSER ON THE TWO MEN
text: Continuing toward us, we can now see that they are
dialog: dressed in crude garments made of animal skins. If we
text: squint we can see their hair is long, their jutting
text: foreheads significant of primitive Homo Sapiens. They
text: continue toward us, the wind beating against them,
text: CAMERA IS CRANING DOWN to the snow that lies before
text: them. To LARGE THREE-TOED TRACKS.
text: FOLLOWING THE PRIMITIVES
text: As they track the three-toed prints to a rocky crevice in
text: the hard-pack ice. The prints stop here, and so do the
text: men. Dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their
dialog: quarry.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ICE CAVE
text: Dark in here, except where the sunlight penetrates the
text: thick, glassy ice walls. The silhouettes of the
text: Primitives stark against the glistening cavern. The
text: sound of flint being struck, then A TORCH CATCHES FIRE,
text: illuminating their faces. And:
speaker_heading: A CREATURE
text: Deeper in the cave. Fleeing the light and the men. We
text: get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light,
text: seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray,
text: dinosaur-like skin. And large black eyes. But it moves
text: quickly enough away that any other identifying feature
text: is lost in the deeper shadows.
speaker_heading: THE PRIMITIVES
text: Removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under
text: their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the
text: constricting cavern, giving chase.
text: Following them as they moves with animal-like agility
text: through the tightening space. Predatory hunters. Their
dialog: torchlight catching:
speaker_heading: THE CREATURE
text: As it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller
text: crevice leading off the main one. The Primitives
text: entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind.
text: The LEAD PRIMITIVE dropping to the cave floor,
text: pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit.
text: Splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on
dialog: the run.
scene_heading: INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - HIGH ANGLE DOWN
text: The fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead
text: man. Throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what
text: appears to be a box cavern.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON LEAD PRIMITIVE
text: Rising quickly to his feet. Not seeing what the torch
text: illuminates just behind him: The face of a dead
text: Primitive Man, his body frozen into the ice. He does
text: finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's
text: ATTACKED VICIOUSLY FROM BEHIND.
text: The torch falls to the floor so that the fight is
text: difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. The creature
text: squealing wildly as the grunts of the Primitive now turn
text: to the sounds of painful struggle. Until:
scene_heading: THE SECOND PRIMITIVE MAN
text: Suddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body
text: of the Creature. Again and again, until the Creature is
text: driven away into the shadows.
text: The Second Man grabs the torch now, not to see if his
text: hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the
text: Creature. In the light we see that he and his weapon are
text: covered with spatters of OILY BLACK BLOOD. As is the
text: First Primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor.
text: The Second Primitive stepping over his hunting mate,
text: stalking the Creature into the shadows, where it has
text: collapsed. The torch finally landing, for the first
text: time, on its face.
text: When the torchlight hits its face, the Creature attacks.
text: But the Primitive prevails. He drops his torch and
text: dispatches the already wounded Creature with strong
text: hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the
text: Creature's eye.
text: LOW ANGLE ON THE DEAD CREATURE
text: The torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the
text: dead creature's face. Its wounds are flowing with the
text: oily black blood, which, oddly now, BEGINS TO POOL. As
text: if it has intelligence, sentience. Pooling and traveling
text: into a fissure in the cave floor. And disappearing.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE SECOND PRIMITIVE
text: Watching this, unknowing. His chest heaving from the
text: fight, as the spots of Oily Black Blood which have
text: spattered onto him begin to crawl. Crawling toward his
text: eyes and mouth. Causing him to let out grunts of fear.
text: Which are the sounds we hear as the CAMERA SLOWLY CRANES
text: UP past the struggling Primitive to the roof of the
text: cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch FADE AWAY
text: with the sounds of struggle. Moving into darkness and
text: silence. But only for a moment. Until:
text: SUNSHINE BREAKS THROUGH THE ROOF OF THE CAVE - PRESENT
speaker_heading: DAY
text: Along with the spade of a shovel. And then -- the
text: earthen cave ceiling gives way and A BOY wearing Nikes
text: and an old t-shirt falls through it. Falling PAST
text: CAMERA. We hear a YELL, then a THUD, and a CLATTERING of
text: the shovel that's fallen in with him. Then a pained
speaker_heading: GASPING.
text: Then SEVERAL HEADS appear in the opening. These are BOYS
text: of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. Hot
text: sunlight blazing in. We have traveled far, far forward
dialog: in time.
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: Hey, Stevie. You okay?
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - PRESENT DAY
scene_heading: THEIR POV OF STEVIE
text: On the floor below covered with dirt, in his nose and
text: mouth. Spitting out. (All these boys have Texas in their
dialog: voices.)
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: I got...I got....I got....
dialog: (straining)
dialog: ....the wind knocked out of me.
text: This draws no sympathy from above, only LAUGHTER.
text: THE BOYS UP ABOVE
text: Staring excitedly.
speaker_heading: 3RD BOY
text: Looks like a cave or something.
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: What's down there, Stevie? Anything?
text: OVER THE BOYS ABOVE
text: Stevie has gotten up, moving out of the patch of
text: sunlight. Disappearing from view for a moment. Then
text: reappearing, still spitting out dirt. But holding:
speaker_heading: STEVIE
text: Human skull.
text: One side partially missing from the cranium. But it
text: brings WHOOPS of delight from the boys above.
speaker_heading: 3RD BOY
dialog: Toss it up here, dude.
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: No way, buttwipe. I found it. It's
dialog: mine.
text: ANGLE UP ON STEVIE
text: The other boys looking down at him. Stevie looking at
text: the skull. Strangely, the light shines through it. It is
text: milky, opaque, as if it's bone that's turned somehow
text: glassy in places. Then:
speaker_heading: STEVIE
dialog: Anyways, there's bones all over the
dialog: place down here.
text: Stevie looks down at his feet. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIS LOOK
text: DOWN to where there are indeed more human bones. And
text: something else. He takes a couple of steps in place,
text: standing in a familiar BLACK, OILY substance -- which is
text: climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor, over
text: the edge of the shoe and down into the shoe itself. Then
text: the SKULL drops in the frame, clattering on the hard
text: floor of the cave.
text: CAMERA SLOWLY RISING UP FROM STEVIE'S SHOES
text: Following SUBCUTANEOUS WORMS which have begun locomoting
text: aggressively up his legs. As his whole body is WRACKED
text: by a shivering seizure of some kind.
text: CAMERA RISES, following the path of the worms as they
text: move up the legs of his shorts. Some appearing on his
text: bare arms, but the great majority continuing up to
text: Stevie's neck, toward his face. Stevie stands paralyzed.
text: Letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the
text: wind was knocked out of him.
speaker_heading: 3RD BOY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, Stevie....
text: But Stevie cannot answer him. CAMERA CONTINUING UP to
text: the boys above. Looking down at their friend. Their eyes
dialog: go wide.
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: You okay?
text: But what they see next answers that question for them.
scene_heading: THEIR POV OF STEVIE
text: His face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms.
text: Moving toward his eyes which begin filling with BLACK
text: OIL. Looking much now like ALIEN EYES.
text: CLOSE ON THE BOYS ABOVE
text: Freaked by what they see. And doing what any kid would
dialog: do now.
speaker_heading: 3RD BOY
dialog: Hey, man. Let's get outta here.
text: And they do. Bolting from the hole in the top of the
text: cave. CAMERA PUSHING UP THROUGH THIS HOLE to REVEAL we
dialog: are:
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL DIRT FIELD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY
text: In a dirt hole that was being dug by the three kids.
text: RISING UP out of the hole to REVEAL the parched dirt
text: patch where THREE KIDS are running away from us, as fast
text: as their feet will take them. Toward A NEW HOUSING TRACT
dialog: (five floorplans to choose from, including the model
text: home.) Disappearing into the neighborhood. A LEGEND
text: appears: NORTH TEXAS, 1998.
text: CAMERA CONTINUES RISING ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS to see the
text: surrounding expanse of empty Texas flatland. And in the
text: distance, the DALLAS SKYLINE.
text: As CAMERA SETTLES, there are a few moments of nothing
text: but the sound of the wind gently whistling across the
text: landscape. In which we bury a short TIME CUT.
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NORTHERN TEXAS - DAY
text: Then we HEAR it, before we see it: FIRE ENGINES pulling
text: into the neighborhood, sirens WAILING. CAMERA DROPPING
text: AGAIN as the lead engine pulls up. FIREMEN are hopping
text: off, moving to the hole the boys dug.
text: LOW ANGLE UP FROM BELOW GROUND LEVEL, IN THE DUGOUT
speaker_heading: HOLE
text: TWO firemen carrying a ladder clamber down PAST CAMERA,
text: THREE OTHERS appearing on their heels. The other two
text: firemen clamber down, too. THE CAPTAIN at the edge of
text: the hole watching them. Holding a radio.
speaker_heading: FIRE CAPTAIN
dialog: This is Captain Miles Cooles...we've
dialog: got a rescue situation in progress...
scene_heading: INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS
text: As the LEAD FIREMAN steps down the ladder into the cave.
text: He scans the darkness, illuminated only by the shaft of
text: light permitted by the hole above. As the 2ND FIREMAN
text: drops down next to him. The both stand motionless now,
text: as if sensing something.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: Stevie's feet are just visible on the floor of the cave,
text: a short distance away.
scene_heading: RESUME FIREMEN - LOW ANGLE
text: They start cautiously toward Stevie. CAMERA FINDING
text: their feet. Tracking through the same OILY, BLACK
text: SUBSTANCE we saw bleeding from the creature thirty five
text: thousand years ago. As they move into the shadows, we
text: HOLD ON THE SUBSTANCE....and see it MOVE. It's alive.
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT FIELD - SHORT TIME LATER
text: CAMERA RISES out of the dirt hole, finds A GROUP OF
speaker_heading: NEIGHBORS:
text: Concerned PARENTS, KIDS, including Stevie's friends.
text: They're held at a distance by the remaining firemen.
text: Everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward. Looking
dialog: at:
scene_heading: A MED-EVAC CHOPPER
text: Coming off the sun-setting horizon. Moving toward us at
text: high speed. The WHOP, WHOP of its blade soon shaking the
text: neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just
text: over the dirt field. Landing gently on the parched hard
text: scrabble.
text: The side door flies open and FIVE HAZ-MAT RESCUE
text: PARAMEDICS jump out carrying a bubble litter. CAMERA
text: PANS THEM to the dirt hole past THE FIRE CAPTAIN. The
text: Haz-Mat Paramedics moving down into the hole. The Fire
text: Captain watches this, then stares toward --
text: DR. BEN BRONSCHWEIG (in shirtsleeves, tie), exiting the
text: chopper, following up the rear. The Captain meeting him
dialog: in route.
speaker_heading: BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: (over the chopper)
dialog: Keep those people back. Get them out
dialog: of here.
speaker_heading: FIRE CAPTAIN
dialog: (to his men)
dialog: Move them all back.
dialog: (dogging Bronschweig)
dialog: I sent four men down after the boy.
text: They're not responding.
text: Dr. Bronschweig's focus is elsewhere, though. He's
text: making a bee line to the earthen hole where young Stevie
text: is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed
text: QUARANTINE BUBBLE LITTER by the rescue squad.
text: Bronschweig watches with great concern. Getting a good
text: look now at Stevie's paralyzed body as it passes him.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON CHOPPER
text: As Stevie's body is loaded aboard, the side door is slid
text: shut. The engine throttles up and the chopper takes
text: flight again, almost as quickly as it arrived. The prop
dialog: wash blowing:
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
text: And the gathering crowd. Bronschweig watches the chopper
text: bank away, then turns his look to:
scene_heading: THE NEIGHBORHOOD
text: Where A SERIES OF UNMARKED CARGO VANS, TRUCKS are
text: rolling in. A fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks
text: like MILITARY PERSONNEL. Most conspicuously TWO WHITE
text: UNMARKED TANKER TRUCKS. (There are NO MARKINGS on these
dialog: vehicles.)
scene_heading: RESUME BRONSCHWEIG
text: As the Fire Captain moves around to face him off.
speaker_heading: FIRE CAPTAIN
dialog: What about my men?
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: (brusquely)
dialog: We're doing all we can.
text: And he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the
text: MILITARY PERSONNEL are pulling out tents, tent poles,
text: scientific equipment. Leaving the Captain to wonder what
text: the hell's going on. Watching the first of many
text: REFRIGERATION UNITS being unloaded. The personnel
text: carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him.
text: Moving RIGHT TO CAMERA and plunging us into BLACK.
text: HOLD. Then OVER BLACK, a familiar sound again. The
text: sound of a chopper auguring in. As we FADE UP, revealing
dialog: we are:
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF A SKYSCRAPER - DAY
text: The chopper is banking over the side of the building,
text: preparing to touch down on the rooftop where FIFTEEN FBI
text: AGENTS in dark ID windbreakers are standing. A LEGEND
text: appears: FEDERAL BUILDING, DALLAS, TEXAS. ONE WEEK
speaker_heading: LATER.
text: The chopper touches down and, again, the side door is
text: thrown open. But now only one man exits: SPECIAL AGENT
scene_heading: IN CHARGE (S.A.C.) DARIUS MICHAUD.
text: Michaud moves with the measured pace of authority,
text: approaching the waiting FBI Agents. One of whom steps
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
dialog: We've evacuated the building and been
text: through it bottom to top. No trace of
dialog: an explosive device or anything
text: resembling one.
scene_heading: S.A.C. MICHAUD
dialog: Have you taken the dogs through?
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
dialog: Yes, sir.
scene_heading: S.A.C. MICHAUD
dialog: Well, take them through again.
dialog: This is given as a non-negotiable order, to the somewhat
text: weary FBI man. Who turns back to his charges, Michaud
text: does not register this attitude, though. Something else
text: has caught his attention. Causing him to walk to the
text: edge of the building. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM, seeing what
text: he sees now.
text: On an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be AN FBI
text: AGENT in an ID windbreaker exiting onto the roof. CAMERA
text: CONTINUING AROUND into A CLOSE UP PROFILE of S.A.C
text: Michaud. Staring at this, his jaw set. He doesn't like
text: what he sees. And what he sees is:
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP OPPOSING SKYSCRAPER - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Special Agent Dana Scully is coming out the door leading
text: onto the roof. The door slams shut behind her. She, too,
text: is dressed in an FBI windbreaker. She's dialing her
text: cell phone as she moves around the rooftop looking for
dialog: something. Dialing the number of:
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Mulder -- it's me --
speaker_heading: MULDER (FILTER)
dialog: Where are you, Scully?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I'm on the roof.
speaker_heading: MULDER (FILTER)
dialog: Did you find something?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: No. I haven't.
speaker_heading: MULDER (FILTER)
dialog: What's wrong, Scully?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm
dialog: hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to
dialog: be honest, what I'm doing here.
speaker_heading: MULDER (FILTER)
dialog: You're looking for a bomb.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I know that. But the threat was called
dialog: in for the Federal Building across the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: MULDER (FILTER)
dialog: I think they have that covered.
text: WE ARE TRACKING WITH SCULLY.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (impatience)
dialog: Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat
dialog: is called in, the logical purpose of
dialog: providing this information is to allow
dialog: us to find the bomb. The rational
dialog: object of terrorism is to promote
dialog: terror. If you'd study model
dialog: behavioral pattern in virtually every
text: case where a threat has turned up an
dialog: explosive device. If we don't act in
dialog: accordance with that data -- if you
dialog: ignore it as we have done -- the
dialog: chances are great that if here
dialog: actually is a bomb we might not find
dialog: it. Lives could be lost --
text: Scully, engrossed in her own argument, realizes she's
text: been the only one speaking for the last short while. She
text: stops walking.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Mulder...?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What happened to playing a hunch?
text: Scully almost JUMPS out of her own skin. The voice has
text: come not over the phone, but from two feet away where:
text: ANGLE TO INCLUDE AGENT MULDER
text: Standing in the shadow of a large air conditioning unit.
text: Cracking a trademark sunflower seed between his teeth.
text: Clicking his cell phone off. Moving out.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Jesus, Mulder...
speaker_heading: MULDER
text: The element of surprise, Scully.
dialog: Random acts of unpredictability. If we
dialog: fail to anticipate the unforeseen or
dialog: expect the unexpected in a universe of
dialog: infinite possibilities, we find
dialog: ourselves at the mercy of anyone or
dialog: anything that cannot be programmed,
dialog: categorized or easily referenced...
text: Mulder has moved to the edge of the building where he
text: sails his sunflower seeds into the air. Dusting his
text: hands off as if lost in a wistful through for just a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What are we doing up here? It's hotter
dialog: than hell.
text: And he's on the move. Scully moving to catch up.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Mulder is moving toward the stairs, Scully catching him.
text: Mulder allowing her to lead him up the steps.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I know you're bored in this
dialog: assignment, but unconventional
dialog: thinking is only going to get you into
dialog: trouble now.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: You've got to quit looking for what
text: isn't there. They've closed the
dialog: X-Files. There's procedure to be
dialog: followed here. Protocol.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What do you say we call in a bomb
dialog: threat for Houston. I think it's free
text: beer night at the Astrodome.
text: Scully gives him a look. It's no use. She reaches the
text: door first, grabs the knob but... it won't open. Turning
dialog: to Mulder.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Now what?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (suddenly nervous)
dialog: It's locked?
text: She wiggles the knob again.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: So much for anticipating the
dialog: unforeseen...
text: Scully squints into the sun, staring at Mulder. But he's
text: quick on the draw, and realizes what she's up to. He
text: grabs for the door and... it opens. Looking to Scully
text: whose hard look of mock-scolding has become a smirking
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Had you.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: No you didn't.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Oh yeah. Had you big time.
text: And that's how it continues as they re-enter the
text: stairwell, the door slamming shut behind them.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY
text: As an elevator DINGS and the doors open. Scully and
text: Mulder exit into the lobby where people move in and out.
text: Heads turn due to their FBI jackets. (Included
text: atmosphere: a GROUP OF KIDS on a field trip, being led
text: into an elevator by THEIR TEACHER.)
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I saw your face, Mulder. There was a
text: moment of panic.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Panic? Have you ever seen me panic,
dialog: Scully?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I just did. You're buying.
text: Mulder fishes for change, but more out of
dialog: sportsmanship.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi?
dialog: A saline IV?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Something sweet.
text: Scully flashes a thin victory smile, as Mulder heads
dialog: off.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Mulder moving to a door with a small shingle above it
text: which says SNACKS/BEVERAGES. As he approaches, sorting
text: through the change he's fished up, the door opens and A
text: MAN IN A VENDOR'S UNIFORM appears. He makes casual and
text: ever-so-brief eye contact with Mulder as he brushes past
text: him. Mulder making no note of this as he moves to catch
text: the door before it closes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SNACK AREA AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY
text: Mulder takes a few steps down into the windowless room.
text: Moving past the snack machines to a LIGHTED soda
dialog: machine.
text: Finding the correct change and plunking it in. Hitting a
text: button, but... nothing comes out.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Oh, come on.
text: He beats his fist a couple of times on the front of the
dialog: machine.
text: Nothing. He finds more change. Plunking it in. Hits the
text: button. Nothing. He stares at the machine a minute, then
text: BEATS IT HARD with his fist. Nothing.
text: Moving around to the back of the machine, looking for:
text: ANGLE ACROSS BACK OF MACHINE
text: Mulder's face peering in on the slim space between the
text: machine and the wall. Reaching down and lifting the PLUG
text: on the end of the electrical cord. It isn't plugged in.
text: Realizing now why the machine hasn't spit out his
dialog: sodas.
scene_heading: RESUME FRONT ANGLE ON MACHINE
text: As Mulder appears, stepping very lightly in front of the
text: machine that he was just pounding away on. Looking at
text: it, then moving quickly to the door he entered through.
text: Grasping the knob, but finding it... LOCKED. He jiggles
text: the knob, pulls on it. But there's no two ways about it,
text: he's locked in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY
text: Scully stands looking at her watch. Wondering where
text: Mulder is. When her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She
dialog: answers it.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Scully...
speaker_heading: MULDER (FILTER)
dialog: Scully, I found the bomb.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (thinks he's joking)
dialog: Where are you, Mulder?
speaker_heading: MULDER (FILTER)
text: I'm in the vending room.
text: Scully is on the move, but she doesn't believe him for a
dialog: second.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Scully appears, heard A POUNDING. Following this noise
text: to the door Mulder is obviously on the other side of.
text: Tries the door.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Is that you pounding?
scene_heading: INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY
text: Mulder holds his phone to his ear, using his other hand
dialog: to pound.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Scully, get somebody to open this
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: SCULLY (FILTER)
dialog: Nice try, Mulder.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWING MULDER as he steps back, revealing now
text: that he's gotten the hinged front of the coke machine
text: open. But we can't yet see what's inside.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Scully -- listen to me. It's in the
dialog: coke machine. You've got about
dialog: fourteen minutes to get this building
dialog: evacuated.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Scully is shaking her head. Tries the door again.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: C'mon. Open the door.
text: His response to this is MORE HARD POUNDING.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
speaker_heading: MULDER (FILTER)
dialog: Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty
dialog: eight, thirteen fifty seven...
text: As he is doing this, Scully is bending to see:
speaker_heading: THE KEYHOLE
text: It's been freshly soldered over.
scene_heading: INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY
text: Mulder stands pacing in front of:
scene_heading: AN ELABORATELY ENGINEERED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE
text: Wired with circuit boards, electric belts and generally
dialog: looking like it would take an expert a good long time to
dialog: figure out where to even start. A lot longer than the
text: 13:58 that reads on the digital read-out.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: ...thirteen fifty six...
speaker_heading: SCULLY (FILTER)
dialog: Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of
dialog: there.
text: The line goes dead. And off Mulder's deepening anxiety,
dialog: we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY
text: Scully enters like General Patton, taking charge.
text: Barking at the security guards who sit behind their
text: security console.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I need this building evacuated and
dialog: cleared out in ten minutes! I need you
dialog: to get on the phone and tell the fire
dialog: department to block off the city
dialog: center in one mile radius around the
dialog: building --
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: In ten minutes.....?!
speaker_heading: SCULLY
text: DON'T THINK! JUST PICK UP THE PHONE
dialog: AND MAKE IT HAPPEN!
text: And she's moving, dialing her cell phone now.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I
dialog: need to speak to S.A.C. Michaud. He's
dialog: got the wrong building --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING - DAY
text: UNMARKED FBI VANS, CARS are pulling up out front.
text: Agents in windbreakers are exiting, moving at a run to
text: the building. Among them S.A.C. Darius Michaud. Moving
dialog: to:
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SCULLY
text: Exiting the building. Behind her, WORKERS are beginning
text: to stream out of the building, as well as the young
text: FIELD TRIPPERS. Michaud meeting up with Scully
text: mid-plaza. As the windbreaker Agents move past them,
text: entering the building.
scene_heading: S.A.C. MICHAUD
dialog: Where is it?
text: MOVING WITH THEM now, back toward the building. As FIRE
text: TRUCKS are pulling up out in the street out front.
text: Suddenly this has the distinct feel of a situation
text: veering out of control.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
text: Mulder found it in a vending machine.
text: He's locked in with it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: MULDER staring at it. If he wasn't sweating enough on
text: the roof, he's certainly sweating now. When his cell
text: phone RINGS. Answering it.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Scully?
speaker_heading: SCULLY (FILTER)
dialog: Mulder. Move away from the door. We're
text: coming through it.
text: No sooner is this said than the CAMERA WHIPS OFF MULDER
text: to the door, where A GAS PLASMA TORCH FLAME is sizzling
text: along the hinges.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Where Michaud himself, wearing a Kevlar vest now, is
text: wielding the torch. Expertly cutting the metal while
text: Scully and TWO AGENTS and TWO DALLAS BOMB SQUAD men look
text: on. In the b.g. BUILDING EMPLOYEES are streaming out.
text: Michaud finishes and shuts off the torch. Yelling:
scene_heading: S.A.C. MICHAUD
dialog: Go.
text: The other Agents kick the metal door in sending it
text: crashing to the floor. Mulder stands on the other side.
text: Watching Michaud pick up a heft tool kit, stepping over
text: the downed door.
text: Scully right behind him. Along with the Agents, Bomb
dialog: techs.
scene_heading: ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE SODA MACHINE/BOMB
text: As Michaud steps in next to him, sizing up the time on
text: the ticking digital readout: 4:07. And just exactly what
dialog: kind of defusing work he's got cut out for him.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Tell me this is just soda pop in those
text: canisters.
scene_heading: S.A.C. MICHAUD
dialog: No. It's what it looks like. A big
text: I.E.D. - ten gallons of astrolite.
dialog: (studying the bomb)
dialog: Okay, get everybody out of here and
text: clear the building.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Somebody's got to stay with you --
scene_heading: S.A.C. MICHAUD
dialog: I gave you an order. Now get the hell
dialog: out of here and evacuate the area.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Can you defuse it?
text: Setting his tool kit down, opening it. As the other
text: Agents heed his word, exiting the room.
scene_heading: S.A.C. MICHAUD
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You've got about four minutes to find
dialog: out if you're wrong.
text: Michaud turns on him with unexpected intensity.
scene_heading: S.A.C. MICHAUD
dialog: Did you hear what I said?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Let's go, Mulder.
text: Scully starts out. Mulder stares at Michaud for a
text: moment, but Michaud's focus is on the bomb now. He won't
text: meet Mulder's look. Finally Mulder moves off, following
dialog: Scully.
text: CAMERA HOLDS ON MICHAUD, just staring at the bomb. Just
text: staring.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The last of the building occupants are being hauled off
text: in CITY BUSES which have moved in curbside. As these

text: cars. As Mulder and Scully exit the front door. Moving
text: quickly, until Mulder hits mid-plaza and slows. Scully
text: not realizing this for a few steps, then turning.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: (off his non-response)
dialog: Mulder --
text: One last windbreakered Agent is exiting. Moving past
text: them to the last cop car other than the car waiting for
text: Mulder and Scully.
speaker_heading: LAST AGENT OUT
text: All clear.
text: Mulder has stopped and is looking back to the building
text: now as Scully hustles back the few steps separating
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Something's wrong.
text: ANGLE OVER THEM TO THE WAITING CAR
text: As the Last Agent Out's car zooms away. Leaving only
text: their car and the man driving it: a WINDBREAKERED
text: AGENT.
scene_heading: WINDBREAKERED AGENT
dialog: What's he doing?
text: The plaza is desolate now, void of life.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Something's not right...
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: -- Mulder! Get in the car!
text: Scully is pulling him now. Pulling him toward the car
text: and the obviously impatient Windbreakered Agent.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: There's no time!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SNACK AND SODA VENDING MACHINE ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON BOMB. The seconds ticking off now, as it passes
text: the :30 mark. CAMERA PULLING BACK, ADJUSTING to Michaud.
text: His tool chest is closed up, and he is sitting on it
text: improbably. Still staring at the bomb, then pulling his
text: head down in what appears to be resignation. As the
text: seconds tick away.
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Mulder has relented now, against his better instincts.
text: Moving with Scully to the car, faster as they go. The

scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. VENDING MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
scene_heading: S.A.C. MICHAUD

speaker_heading: HARD CUT BACK

scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE BOMB BUILDING - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Mulder and Scully getting in the car. TRACKING BACKWARDS
text: with them now as the Agent driving pulls away, getting
text: only thirty, maybe forty yards when: the BOMB DETONATES
dialog: and the building EXPLODES. And this is no fatwa symbolic
dialog: little terror strike. This is Oklahoma City. Or do we
dialog: say, Independence Day.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE ON CAR
text: As all the windows blow out and the car is lifted up,
text: slamming into the corner of a parked car. The air so
text: quickly full of debris that it would seem the whole city
text: has been destroyed.
scene_heading: RESUME BUILDING
text: As the debris starts to clear somewhat, much of it still
text: floating to the ground, though. We see the fires raging
text: on every floor. That most of the front of the building
dialog: has been torn away and we can see right into many
dialog: floors.
scene_heading: RESUME ANGLE ON CAR
text: Where it sits half cocked against a parked car. The air
text: is full of debris, particulated matter. The rear door of
text: the squad car opens now and Mulder gets out, covered with

dialog: for Scully.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY
text: A formal hearing. Several ASSISTANT DIRECTORS sit at a

text: PANNING the group, the sound of papers shuffling, the
text: occasional clearing of a throat creating a stale air of
dialog: importance, under:
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: ...there is a heightened need at the
dialog: Attorney General's office to place
dialog: responsibility as early as possible.
scene_heading: CAMERA LANDING ON ASSISTANT DIRECTOR JANA CASSIDY
text: A no-nonsense 40 year-old lawyer cum FBI Agent.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: ...for the catastrophic destruction of
dialog: public property and the loss of life
dialog: due to terrorist activities...
text: Next to Cassidy is Assistant Director WALTER SKINNER,
text: Mulder and Scully's former superior on the X-Files.
text: Looking ruefully at:
scene_heading: AGENT SCULLY
text: At a small table, the chair next to her conspicuously
text: empty.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Many details are still unclear; some
dialog: agents' reports have not been filed,
dialog: or have come in sketchy, without a
dialog: satisfactory accounting of the events
dialog: that led to the destruction in Dallas.
dialog: But we're under some pressure to give
dialog: an accurate picture of what happened
dialog: to the Attorney General, so she can
dialog: issue a public statement.
text: The door to the room opens behind Scully now, and Mulder
text: enters, his manner that of a man who knows he's late to
dialog: a function.
scene_heading: RESUME A.D. CASSIDY
text: She looks up at Mulder and Scully with a stern glare.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: We now know that five people died in
text: the explosion. Special Agent in Charge
dialog: Darius Michaud who was trying to
text: defuse the bomb that had been hidden
text: in a vending machine. Three firemen
text: from Dallas, and a young boy.
scene_heading: OVER MULDER AND SCULLY
text: Mulder pulls out his chair to sit down, but remains
text: standing. They trade a look. This is new news to them.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Excuse me -- the firemen and the boy
dialog: -- they were in the building?
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Agent Mulder, since you weren't able
dialog: to be on time for this hearing, I'm
dialog: going to ask you to step outside so
dialog: that we can get Agent Scully's version
dialog: of the facts. So that she won't have
dialog: to be paid the same disrespect.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: We were told the building was clear.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You'll get your turn, Agent Mulder.
dialog: Please step out.
text: Mulder trades looks with:
speaker_heading: A.D. SKINNER
text: Who stares at him evenly, but not unsympathetically.
dialog: He's been here with Mulder on many occasions. Seen
text: Mulder run up against the Bureau and its stiff
dialog: conventions. Always in the middle.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: It does say there in your paperwork
dialog: that we were the ones who found the
dialog: bomb...
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Thank you, Agent Mulder. We'll call
dialog: you in shortly.
scene_heading: RESUME MULDER, SCULLY
text: As Mulder slides his chair in. Scully watching him
dialog: exit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OPR HEARING ROOM - DAY
text: Mulder sits by himself in a chair, head down. When the
text: door to the hearing room opens. Mulder rising as A.D.
text: Skinner exits.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
text: Sit down, they're still talking to
text: Agent Scully.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: -- They're asking her for a narrative.
dialog: They want to know why she was in the
dialog: wrong building.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: She was with me.
text: Skinner studies Mulder, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: You don't see what's going on here, do
dialog: you?
dialog: (off Mulder's look)
dialog: There's four hundred million dollars
dialog: in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives
dialog: have been lost. No suspects have been
dialog: named. So the story being shaped is
dialog: this could have been prevented. That
dialog: the FBI didn't do its job.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: And they want to blame us?
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Agent Mulder -- we both know that if
dialog: you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the
dialog: initiative to search the adjacent
dialog: building, you could have multiplied
dialog: the fatalities by a hundred --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (grasping the irony)
dialog: But it's not the lives we saved. It's
dialog: the lives we didn't.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: (reciting the dictum)
dialog: -- if it looks bad, it's bad for the
dialog: FBI --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: -- if they want someone to blame,
dialog: they can blame me. Agent Scully
dialog: doesn't deserve this.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: She's in there right now saying the
dialog: same thing about you.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I breached protocol. I broke contact
dialog: with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary
text: tactical rule and left him alone with
dialog: the device.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Agent Scully says it was she who
dialog: ordered you out of the building. That
dialog: you wanted to go back.
text: Mulder doesn't get to respond, because the door opens
text: again and Agent Scully exits. She looks like she's been
dialog: through it.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (to Skinner)
dialog: They're asking for you, Sir.
text: Skinner gives one last look to Mulder, then re-enters.
text: Leaving Mulder and Scully alone. Scully wearing a pained
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Whatever you told them in there, you
dialog: don't have to protect me.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: All I told them was the truth.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: They're trying to divide us on this,
dialog: Scully. We can't let them.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: They have divided us, Mulder. They're
dialog: splitting us up.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What? What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow
dialog: for remediation and reassignment...
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I think you must have an idea. They
dialog: cited a history of problems relating
dialog: back to 1993.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: They were the ones that put us
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Because they wanted me to invalidate
dialog: your work, your investigations into
dialog: the paranormal. But I think this goes
dialog: deeper than that.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: This isn't about you, Scully. They're
dialog: doing this to me.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: They're not doing this, Mulder.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: I left behind a career in medicine
dialog: because I thought I might make a
dialog: difference at the FBI. When they
dialog: recruited me they told me women made
dialog: up nine percent of the bureau. I felt
dialog: this was not an impediment, but an
dialog: opportunity to distinguish myself. But
dialog: it hasn't turned out that way. And
dialog: now, if I were to be transferred to
dialog: Omaha, or Wichita or some field office
dialog: where I'm sure I could rise, it just
dialog: doesn't hold the interest for me it
dialog: once did. Not after what I've seen and
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You're... quitting?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: There's really no reason left for me
dialog: to stay anymore.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: Maybe you should ask yourself if your
text: heart's still in it, too.
text: The door opens to the hearing room again now. A.D.
text: Skinner steps part way out, gesturing to him.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Agent Mulder. You're up.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (regretfully)
dialog: I'm sorry. Good luck.
text: Mulder rises. Scully studying his poorly disguised hurt.
text: Before he turns and goes into the room.
text: Scully watching the door close behind him. Her feelings
text: poorly disguised, too.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON A SHOOTER OF TEQUILA being poured. CAMERA
text: ADJUSTING to reveal the ATTRACTIVE BARMAID tipping the
text: bottle. Pushing it across the bar to where TWO EMPTY
text: SHOOTERS sit, making the exchange.
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: I'd say this about exceeds your
dialog: minimum daily requirement.
dialog: The person she's talking to us:
speaker_heading: MULDER
text: He sits by himself on a stool, staring down at the bar.
text: Staring at the shooter which he spins with his fingers.
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: Gotta train for this kind of heavy
dialog: lifting.
text: Mulder tosses back the shooter anyway. She watches him
text: as she retrieves the small shot glass, intrigued by his
text: dark silence.
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: Poopy day?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: A woman?
dialog: (Mulder shakes his head no)
dialog: Work.
text: Mulder nods, pointing to the tequila bottle again. The
text: Barmaid agrees to pour another one, reluctantly.
text: ANGLE OVER TO A MAN AT THE END OF THE BAR
text: Staring at Mulder intently. He's older than Mulder,
text: dressed in an old Brooke Brothers light summer suit.
text: Mulder notices him, feels his gaze, but doesn't give it
dialog: thought.
scene_heading: RESUME BARMAID, MULDER
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What do I do.
dialog: (off her curious look)
dialog: I'm a key figure in an ongoing
dialog: government charade. An annoyance to my
dialog: superiors. A joke among my peers.
dialog: "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder.
dialog: Whose sister was abducted by aliens
text: when he was a kid. Who now chases
text: little green men with a badge and a
text: gun, shouting to the heavens and
dialog: anyone who'll listen that the fix is
dialog: in. That our government's hip to the
text: truth and a part of the conspiracy.
dialog: That the sky is falling and when it
dialog: hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of
dialog: all time.
text: She stares at him for a moment, startled by his drunken
text: screed. She pulls back the shooter she's just poured
text: Mulder.
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: I think that about does it, Spooky.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Does what?
speaker_heading: BARMAID
dialog: Why don't you go home to the old lady
dialog: --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Sorry. Don't have one.
text: Mulder slides off his stool, noticing:
speaker_heading: MULDER'S POV
text: The Watchful Man is gone.
speaker_heading: RESUME MULDER
text: He feints toward the door, then reverses direction.
text: Heads to the back of the place.
scene_heading: INT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Mulder appears, moving to the bathroom door. Only to
text: find an OUT OF ORDER sign on it. He moves to the woman's
text: room, but it's locked. Gathering what's left of his
text: wits, Mulder does what any red-blooded man would do in
text: this situation. He goes to the back door of the bar and
text: exits into the alley.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - NIGHT
text: Mulder has found a place against a wall, between two
text: dumpsters. Jerking around in surprise at the sound of a
speaker_heading: VOICE.
speaker_heading: WATCHFUL MAN'S VOICE
dialog: That official FBI business?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (startled)
dialog: What?
text: ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE MAN FROM THE BAR
text: He's not far from Mulder. His name is KURTZWEIL.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Bet the Bureau's accusing you of the
dialog: same thing in Dallas.
text: Mulder's weirded out as the stranger moves to him un-
text: threateningly.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Standing around holding your yank
text: while bombs are exploding.
text: Kurtzweil enjoys a little laugh over this.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Do I know you?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: No. I've been watching your career for
dialog: a good while. Back when you were just
dialog: a promising young agent -- before
dialog: that.
text: Mulder stares at this man as he finishes, zipping up.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You follow me out here for a reason?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Yeah, I did.
text: Kurtzweil unzips his own pants now. There is a moment;
text: one of those awkward moments where Mulder's not sure
text: what's about to happen. But Kurtzweil's just relieving
text: himself, too. Shuffling up to the wall, Mulder takes
text: this as an opportunity to head back toward the bar. But
text: Kurtzweil hails him again.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin
dialog: Kurtzweil.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I know the name. Why?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Old friend of your father's.
text: Kurtzweil continues peeing. Knows this got Mulder's
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Back at the Department of State. We
dialog: were what you might call fellow
text: travelers, but his disenchantment
text: outlasted mine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I never believed in the Project.
text: Mulder stares at Kurtzweil now. He's being toyed with.
text: He turns, opens the door into the bar. As Kurtzweil gets
text: a little louder.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Oh, come on. Don't pretend you don't
dialog: know about the Project. Your father
dialog: died for it. Your sister was taken
dialog: because of it.
text: Kurtzweil finishes nature's call. Zips up. Heads after
text: Mulder.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT
text: Mulder is coming from the back. Kurtzweil moving to
text: catch up. And he does, at the coat stand. The place has
text: pretty much cleared out, except for the Barmaid and some
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: How'd you find me?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Heard you come here now and again.
dialog: Figured you'd be needing a little
dialog: drinky tonight.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You a reporter?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned
scene_heading: that. OB-GYN.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Who sent you?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: I came on my own. After reading about
dialog: the bombing in Dallas.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Well, if you've got something to tell
dialog: me, you've got as long as it takes me
dialog: to hail a cab...
text: Mulder starts out the door, but Kurtzweil grabs his
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: They're going to pin Dallas on you,
dialog: Agent Mulder. But there was nothing
dialog: you could've done. Nothing anyone
dialog: could've done to prevent that bomb
dialog: from going off. Because the truth is
dialog: something you'd never have guessed;
dialog: never have predicted.
text: Mulder pulls away from Kurtzweil, but Kurtzweil dogs him
dialog: to:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT
text: The street is empty, the hour is late. Mulder moves to
dialog: the curb.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: And what's that?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or
text: intended to defuse the bomb.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (rhetorical disbelief)
text: He just let it explode.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: What's the question nobody's asking?
dialog: Why that building? Why not the Federal
dialog: Building?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: The Federal Building was too well
dialog: guarded.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: No. They put the bomb in the building
text: across the street because it DID have
dialog: federal offices. The Federal Emergency
dialog: Management Agency had a provisional
dialog: medical quarantine office there. Which
dialog: is where the bodies were found. But
dialog: that's the thing...
text: Mulder's got his hand up for a taxi coming. It's pulling
text: over as Mulder steps from the curb, stepping away from
dialog: Kurtzweil.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: ...the thing you didn't know. That
dialog: you'd never think to check.
text: Mulder's got the taxi door open, turning to Kurtzweil.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Those people were already dead.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Before the bomb went off?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: That's what I'm saying.
text: Mulder stares at Kurtzweil for a moment.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran
dialog: of the bureau --
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Michaud was a patriot. The men he's
dialog: loyal to know their way around Dallas.
dialog: They blew that building to hide
dialog: something. Maybe something even they
dialog: couldn't predict.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You're saying they destroyed an entire
text: building to hide the bodies of three
dialog: firemen...?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: And one little boy.
text: Mulder gets in the cab, closes the door. Rolls down the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I think you're full of shit.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Do you?
text: Kurtzweil raps the top of the roof and steps away from
text: the car. As the taxi takes off. WE STAY WITH KURTZWEIL,
text: watching Mulder's cab speed away. (NOTE: This should
text: also be covered from inside the cab with Mulder, to play
text: the scene out on him.)

speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Why not? It's three AM.

speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Are you drunk, Mulder?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I was until about an hour ago.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Is that before or after you got the
dialog: idea to come here?
text: Mulder looks at her curiously.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What are you implying, Scully?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (frowning)
dialog: I thought you may have gotten drunk
dialog: and decided to come here to talk me
text: out of quitting.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Is that what you'd like me to do?
text: Scully hesitates. Long enough to indicate her own

speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Go home, Mulder. It's late.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Get dressed, Scully.
speaker_heading: SCULLY

scene_heading: INT. UNMARKED BLACK HELICOPTERS - NIGHT

text: TRUCKS that we saw earlier, and more unmarked vans and
text: trucks. There are men in black fatigues moving about,

dialog: The figure that we've come to know as an assassin and a
dialog: model of modern self-interest and amorality. One of the
text: central protagonists in the conspiracy to keep the truth
dialog: from the American people about the existence of
dialog: extraterrestrial life.

scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: We brought the atmosphere back down to

scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: Brought on by what?
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: Heat, I think. The coincident invasion

dialog: environment that raised his basic body
dialog: temperature above ninety eight point
dialog: six.
text: They step over to a section of the cave which has been

scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG

scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG

scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: No. No...we need to try our vaccine on
dialog: it.
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: And if it's unsuccessful?
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: Incinerate it. Like the others.
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG

scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: Of what?
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN

scene_heading: CLOSE ON PROSTRATE FIREMAN

speaker_heading: MULDER

scene_heading: YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
dialog: General McAddie's.
text: Mulder doesn't miss a beat.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: General McAddie is who requested our

dialog: immediately.
scene_heading: YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
dialog: I don't know anything about that.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Well, call General McAddie.
scene_heading: YOUNG NAVAL GUARD
dialog: I don't have his number.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: They can patch you in through the

text: The Guard is nervous about this, checking his watch. He
text: picks up the phone, going through a large directory.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Hey! We don't have time to dick around
dialog: here watching you demonstrate your
dialog: ignorance in the chain of command. The
dialog: order came direct from General

speaker_heading: SCULLY

speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I can tell you that without even

speaker_heading: SCULLY
text: This body has already been autopsied,
dialog: Mulder. You can tell from the way it's
text: been wrapped and dressed.
text: Undeterred, Mulder works to get the sheet off. The first
text: thing we notice is that he's still in his fireman's
text: uniform. His face looks familiar to us, not because we
dialog: know him, but because of the translucency of skin we saw
text: in the other fireman. (We will also notice he's
text: missing an arm, a leg and large part of his torso.)
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Does this fit the description you just
dialog: read me, Scully?
text: Scully comes around, reacting to what she sees.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Oh my God. This man's tissue...
text: Scully is quickly removing a pair of latex gloves,

speaker_heading: MULDER
text: It's like jelly.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: There's some kind of cellular

text: She palpates the spongy skin on the man's face, neck.
text: Unbuttoning the uniform now, seeing:
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: And there's been no autopsy performed.
dialog: There's no Y incision here; no

speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You're telling me the cause of death
dialog: on the report is false. That this man

speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I don't know what killed this man. I'm

speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I'd been told as much.
speaker_heading: SCULLY

speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Not according to the men in blue.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual

speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: They want to discredit you -- for
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: For what? Because I'm a dangerous man.
dialog: Because I know too much about the
dialog: truth.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You mean that apocalyptic trash you
dialog: write? I knew your name was familiar.
dialog: I just didn't know why.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: You know my work?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in
dialog: bigoted ideas about race or genocide.
dialog: I don't believe in the Elders of Zion,
dialog: the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg
dialog: Group or in a oneworld Jew run
dialog: government --
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: I don't either, but it sure sells

text: He says it with an ironic smile. Causing Mulder to turn

speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I,
dialog: Agent Mulder?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: I picked up the historical document of
dialog: the venality and hypocrisy of the
dialog: American government. The daily
dialog: newspaper.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You said the firemen and the boy were
text: found in the temporary offices of the
dialog: Federal Emergency Management Agency.
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: According to the newspaper, FEMA had
dialog: been called out to manage an outbreak
dialog: of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar
dialog: with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: It was a deadly virus spread by field
dialog: mice in the Southwest U.S. several
dialog: years ago.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: And are you familiar with FEMA? What
dialog: the Federal Emergency Management
dialog: Agency's real power is? FEMA allows
dialog: the White House to suspend
dialog: constitutional government upon
dialog: declaration of a national emergency.
dialog: To create a non-elected government.
dialog: Think about that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What is an agency with such broad

dialog: viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Are you saying it wasn't such a small
dialog: outbreak?
text: Kurtzweil is getting intense now.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus.
text: They are both given a start when a POLICE CRUISER rolls
text: by on the street, giving a burp of its siren. It rolls
text: past as the two men tuck in tighter.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: When we were young men in the
dialog: military, your father and I were
dialog: recruited for a project. They told us
dialog: it was biological warfare. A virus.
dialog: There were rumors about its origins.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What killed those men?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: What killed them I won't even write
dialog: about. I tell you, they'd do more than
dialog: just harass me. They have the future
dialog: to protect.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I'll know soon enough.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: (worked up)
dialog: What killed those men can't be
dialog: identified in simple medical terms. My
dialog: god, we can't even wrap our minds
text: around something as obvious as HIV.
dialog: We have no context for what killed
dialog: those men, or any appreciation of the
dialog: scale in which it will be unleashed in
dialog: the future. Of how it will be
dialog: transmitted; of the environmental
dialog: factors involved.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: A plague?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: The plague to end all plagues, Agent
text: Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet
text: war. The systematic release of an
dialog: indiscriminate organism for which the
dialog: men who will bring it on still have no
dialog: cure. They've been working on this for
dialog: fifty years. While the rest of the
dialog: world was fighting gooks and commies
dialog: these men have been secretly
text: negotiating a planned Armageddon.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Negotiating with whom?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: I think you know. The timetable has
dialog: been set. It will happen on a holiday,
dialog: when people are away from their homes.
dialog: When our elected officials are at
dialog: their resorts or out of the country.
dialog: The President will declare a state of
dialog: emergency, at which time all federal
dialog: agencies, all government will come
dialog: under the power of the Federal
dialog: Emergency Management Agency. FEMA,
text: Agent Mulder. The secret government.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: And they tell me I'm paranoid.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Something's gone wrong -- something
dialog: unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and
dialog: dig. Or you're only going to find out
dialog: like the rest of the country, Agent
text: Mulder. When it's too late.
text: Kurtzweil turns, starts off. Mulder stares after him.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: How can I reach you?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: You can't.
text: Mulder moves to catch up to Kurtzweil, pulling out his

speaker_heading: SCULLY

dialog: too.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Mulder --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I need you there with me. I need your

dialog: was meant to destroy those bodies and
dialog: whatever they were infected by.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I've got a hearing tomorrow --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: -- I'll have you back for it, Scully.
dialog: Maybe with evidence that could blow

speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way

dialog: --
text: Scully hears VOICES in the hall outside the freezer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: MULDER
speaker_heading: MULDER

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - MORGUE FREEZER - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. FBI OFFICE - DALLAS - MORNING - MULDER

text: reads: FBI FIELD OFFICE, DALLAS : 11:20 AM.
speaker_heading: FIELD AGENT
dialog: You're looking for what amounts to a
dialog: needle in a haystack. I'm afraid the
dialog: explosion was so devastating there
dialog: hasn't been a whole lot we've been
dialog: able to put together just yet.
text: They are walking amid BOXES of evidence. STACKS of
text: debris. There are FORENSIC TECHS sorting through this
text: material. It looks like the most tedious and painstaking
dialog: job in the world.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I'm looking for anything out of the
dialog: ordinary. Maybe something from the
dialog: FEMA offices where the bodies were
dialog: found.
speaker_heading: FIELD AGENT
dialog: We weren't expecting to find those
dialog: remains, of course. They went right
text: off to Washington.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Was there anything in those offices
dialog: that didn't go to D.C.?
speaker_heading: FIELD AGENT
text: Some bone fragments came up in the
dialog: sift this morning. We thought there'd
dialog: been another fatality, but we found
dialog: out FEMA had recovered them from an
text: archeological site out of town.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Have you examined them?
speaker_heading: FIELD AGENT
dialog: No. Just fossils, far as I know.
text: Mulder is nodding, when both men look off at something
dialog: that's caught their attention o.s.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I'd like this person to take a look,
dialog: if you don't mind.
scene_heading: THEIR POV - AGENT SCULLY
text: Standing in the doorway to the lab. She looks at Mulder
text: as if she's come in spite of her misgivings. Moving
text: toward them now.
speaker_heading: FIELD AGENT
dialog: Let me just see if I can lay my hands
dialog: on what you're looking for.
text: The Field Agent nods to Scully as he passes, exiting
text: deeper into the room. Leaving Mulder and Scully by
text: themselves momentarily.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You said you weren't coming?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I wasn't planning on it. Particularly
dialog: after spending a half hour in cold
dialog: storage this morning. But I got a
dialog: better look at the blood and tissue
dialog: samples I took from the firemen.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What did you find?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (voice lowering pointedly)
dialog: Something I couldn't show to anyone
dialog: else. Not without more information.
dialog: And not without causing the kind of
dialog: attention I'd just as soon avoid right
dialog: now.
dialog: (off Mulder's look)
dialog: The virus those men were infected with
dialog: contains a protein coat I've never
dialog: seen before. What it did to them it
dialog: did extremely fast. And unlike the
dialog: AIDS virus or any other aggressive
dialog: strain, it survives very nicely
text: outside the body.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: How was it contracted?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: That I don't know. But if it's through
dialog: simple contact of blood to blood, and
dialog: if it doesn't respond to conventional
dialog: treatments, it could be a serious
dialog: health threat.
text: Mulder's reaction is postponed, or at least subdued by
text: the reappearance of the field agent.
speaker_heading: FIELD AGENT
dialog: Like I said, these are fossils, and
text: they weren't near the blast center, so
dialog: they aren't going to tell you much.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: May I?
text: He offers Scully the small glass vials in which the bone
text: fragments have been separated. She takes them, looking
text: at them on her way over to the microscope. Tapping out a
text: tiny fragment onto the viewing bed. She puts her eyes
text: down to the stereoscope eyepieces, then almost
text: immediately looks up at Mulder who translates this look
text: almost instantly.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You said you knew the location of the
dialog: archeological site where these were
dialog: found.
speaker_heading: FIELD AGENT
dialog: Show you right on a map.
text: Off Mulder and Scully's traded looks:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL PUBLIC PARK - WEST TEXAS - DAY
text: The domed white tent is still in place, the fleet of
text: trucks and equipment surrounding it unmanned. Several
text: large sound-dampened generators still hum away, but the
dialog: work being done here would be a mystery to anyone who
text: didn't have access to the tent.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOMED TENT - DAY
text: An electric Bobcat-like bulldozer maneuvers a very high
text: tech-looking CLEAR CONTAINER to the edge of the earthen
text: hole. The container has monitors and gauges on it,
text: oxygen tanks and what looks like a circulation
text: refrigeration unit. A self-contained life support
text: system. The inside of the container is covered with a
text: thin layer of frost.
text: When the small bulldozer gets the container over near
text: the hole, several technicians lift it down off the
text: shovel, hand carrying it toward the hole opening. As Dr.
text: Bronschweig APPEARS, moving to a ladder that leads down
text: into the hole. He's dressed in a haz-mat suit, with the
text: hood off.
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: I need to have those settings checked
dialog: and re-set. I need a steady minus two
dialog: Celsius through the transfer of the
dialog: body, after I administer the vaccine.
text: The men nod to Bronschweig, begin checking the settings
text: as Bronschweig puts his hood on, starts down into the
text: hole, through the clear hatch.
scene_heading: INT. SMALLER ICE CAVE - DAY
text: The refrigeration vents are still pumping in arctic air
text: when Dr. Bronschweig appears descending a fixed ladder.
text: It is dark in here, save for the ice blue glow of light
text: coming from the plastic draped area where we saw the
text: fireman acting as an incubator/host for some kind of
text: organism growing inside him.
text: Bronschweig steps over to this area, moves aside the
text: plastic drapery to enter.
scene_heading: ANGLE INSIDE, PLASTIC LINED AREA
text: Where the body of the fireman is still inside the
text: quarantine bubble litter in f.g. Bronschweig takes out of
text: his pocket a SYRINGE and an AMPULE. Turning now to the
text: body. Stepping to it. Moving a work light, as he had
text: done for the Cigarette Smoking Man, so that it shines on
text: the face of the fireman. But when he does this,
text: Bronschweig nearly JUMPS, his breath stolen away.
dialog: Reacting to:
scene_heading: ANGLE ON FIREMAN'S BODY
text: The chest and torso have imploded. It has been turned
text: into a muddy mass of blood-stained jelly; bone and
text: tissue melted into an oozing mass which has sunken due
text: to the fact that the creature which was inside is now
dialog: gone.
text: CAMERA WHIPS from Bronschweig to the wall. To the
text: temperature gauge which reads about 6 degrees Celsius.
text: WHIPPING BACK to Bronschweig who is now panicked.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. DOMED TENT - DAY
text: ANGLE DOWN ON EARTHEN HOLE, where the Technicians
text: Bronschweig was speaking to minutes ago react to
text: Bronschweig's MUFFLED VOICE. He's down below them in the
text: cave, looking up.
text: Pulling his haz-mat hood off. Yelling up to them.
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: It's gone!
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: It's what?
text: OVER THE TECHNICIANS TO BRONSCHWEIG DOWN BELOW
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
text: It's left the body. I think it's
dialog: gestated --
text: Bronschweig is starting up the ladder when something
text: stops him.
scene_heading: RESUME INT. ICE CAVE
scene_heading: CREATURE'S POV OF BRONSCHWEIG
text: He stands frozen on the ladder, squinting into the
dialog: darkness.
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: Wait -- I see it --
speaker_heading: BRONSCHWEIG'S POV
text: In the shadows there is movement, the creature edging
text: into the light cast from the draped area. We see it is
text: fully formed -- a replica of the Creature we saw at the
dialog: opening of our story. Though it does not make any kind
text: of aggressive move. As if, newborn, it is tentative.
scene_heading: RESUME BRONSCHWEIG - CREATURE'S POV
text: He remains standing on a rung of the ladder for a
text: moment, then takes a gentle step back down to the
dialog: ground.
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: (nervous wonder)
dialog: Oh my god. Oh my god.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: You see it?
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: Yes. It's...amazing. You want to get
dialog: down here --
dialog: (sotto to himself)
dialog: Jesus Lord...so much for little green
dialog: men.
text: Dr. Bronschweig moves shakily to put the syringe in the
text: ampule again...when, suddenly, the Creature STRIKES.
text: CAMERA RUSHING FORWARD TO BRONSCHWEIG.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: OVERHEAD ANGLE - OVER THE TECHNICIANS
text: As the Creature slams into Bronschweig, knocking him out
text: of the line of sight from the top of the earthen hole.
text: There are SCREAMS OF PAIN from Bronschweig, then they
dialog: abate.
scene_heading: RESUME INT. ICE CAVE
text: Bronschweig can be heard, but not clearly seen. He is in
text: the shadows himself now.
text: Trying to pick himself up, and when he manages to do
text: this, teetering back into the light we see that he is
text: bloodied. He is hurt, injured. Making his way back
text: toward the patch of light that comes from the hole
text: above. Hoping to see that help is on its way, while
text: keeping a watchful, wary and worried eye on the shadows,
text: for another attack by the Creature.
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: Hey -- I need help.
text: But the Technicians looking down on him offer him
text: nothing of the sort. All they do is quickly close the
text: clear hatch that seals Bronschweig inside the cave.
scene_heading: DR. BRONSCHWEIG
dialog: Hey!
text: But he gets no answer, climbing the ladder shakily. A
text: moment later the first Bobcat shovel-full of dirt falls
text: onto the clear hatch and partially obscures the light.
text: They are burying Bronschweig alive.
scene_heading: INT. DOMED TENT - DAY
text: ANGLE DOWN ON BRONSCHWEIG through the glass hatch. His
text: SCREAMS continue. ADJUSTING to the small bulldozer which
text: is quickly hauling the mound of excavated earth into the
text: hole from which it came. While, all around, there is a
text: hive of activity. Men running everywhere.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: RESUME INT. ICE CAVE
text: Bronschweig reacts in silent horror now, only to turn in
text: further horror when he feels the impending attack of:
speaker_heading: THE CREATURE
text: Right behind and just below him. Its grotesque features
text: in momentary high resolution, BEFORE IT ATTACKS CAMERA.
text: Over and over, savaging Bronschweig in a violent fury.
text: Its hideous teeth tearing at his flesh - AT CAMERA -
text: driving him off the ladder where the attack continues in
text: momentary glimpses of teeth, of bloody flesh, and of
text: OILY BLACK BLOOD being spattered about. At the
text: height of the violence we hear Bronschweig SCREAM.
dialog: Matching the wound of this, as we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ESTATE SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE LONDON - EARLY EVENING
text: A CHILD'S SCREAM OF JOY. ENGLISH CHILDREN are playing
dialog: tag or some kind of children's game in the
text: well-manicured garden of a man who the CAMERA FINDS IN
dialog: F.G. -- the man we have come to know as THE
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN. He is also a member of the syndicate
text: running "The Project", though his venality is cloaked in
text: civility and statesmanship. Right now he's watching the
text: children from the back steps of his mansion, charmed by
text: their game. When he is called by someone o.s.
speaker_heading: VALET'S VOICE
dialog: Sir -- you have a call.
text: The Well-Manicured Man turns to see:
speaker_heading: HIS VALET
text: Holds the door. After a moment the W.M.M. enters past
text: the Valet. As the screams of the children continue to
dialog: rise and fall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SUBURBAN LONDON ESTATE - A BEAUTIFUL STUDY -
speaker_heading: EVENING
text: The Well-Manicured Man enters, picks up a blinking line.
text: Through a window he can still see the children playing.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
speaker_heading: (FILTER)
dialog: We have a situation. The members are
text: assembling.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Is it an emergency?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH TIGHT CSM AT INT. KENSINGTON BUILDING
speaker_heading: (NEXT LOC.)
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: Yes. A meeting is set. Tonight in
dialog: London, to determine a course.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Who called this meeting?
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
text: Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane
dialog: in Tunis.
dialog: This pronouncement has the power of ending any further
text: questions. An immediate sense of gravity of the
text: situation. The W.M.M. hangs up, moves to the window
text: where he sees some of the HELP is running from the
text: house. The children have all gathered around a BOY who
text: seems to have hurt himself. He's lifted and being
text: carried by the man who's called the W.M.M. into the
dialog: house.
dialog: Off the Well-Manicured Man's concern, we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT
text: A discreet Town Car pulls up out front an understated
text: building in a better West End neighborhood. A driver
text: exits coming around for the Well-Manicured Man who is
text: already exiting, moving to the building. As a LEGEND
text: appears: KENSINGTON, LONDON: 8:01 PM.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KENSINGTON BUILDING - NIGHT
text: The Well-Manicured Man is admitted by a Valet. The
text: interior has the well-heeled look of money, or a finely
text: appointed residence that no one lives in. The Valet
text: takes the W.M.M.'s coat.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Has Strughold arrived?
speaker_heading: VALET
dialog: They're in the library.
text: He leads the W.M.M. down a hall, to:
scene_heading: INT. LARGE STATELY LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: A GROUP OF MEN are standing, looking at something on a
text: TV monitor. A surveillance video. They turn when the
scene_heading: W.M.M. enters. CAMERA FAVORING A SMALL LEAN MAN with
text: close-cropped hair.
text: He is at once elegant and imposing with eyes that hold
text: you with laser-like acuity. He is CONRAD STRUGHOLD.
text: The others are of various ethnicities, tailored and
text: dignified. This might be a collection of U.N. delegates.
dialog: Indeed some are.
dialog: Their business here, however, doesn't represent anyone's
text: interests but their own. As tipped by the attendance of
text: a GROUP ELDER from the U.S. who we've come to know.
text: But, more importantly, by the Cigarette Smoking Man who
text: holds the VCR remote. He pauses the picture.
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: We began to worry. Some of us have
dialog: traveled so far, and you are the last
dialog: to arrive.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke
dialog: his leg.
dialog: The non-response to this has the same effect as a
text: reprimand. But the W.M.M. will not apologize of kowtow.
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: While we've been made to wait, we've
dialog: watched surveillance tapes which have
dialog: raised more concerns.
text: The Well-Manicured Man glances to the TV, sees the
text: frame paused.
scene_heading: HIS POV OF TV MONITOR
text: Where Mulder and Scully's faces are seen in a hallway
dialog: that we recognize as the Bethesda Naval Hospital.
scene_heading: RESUME WELL-MANICURED MAN
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: More concerns than that?
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: We've been forced to reassess our role
dialog: in Colonization by new facts of
dialog: biology which have presented
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: GROUP ELDER
dialog: (speaking up)
text: The virus has mutated.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: On its own?
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: Its effect on the host has changed.
text: The virus no longer just invades the
dialog: brain as a controlling organism. It's
dialog: developed a way to modify the host
dialog: body.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Into what?
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: A new extraterrestrial biological
dialog: entity.
text: It takes a moment to sink in. The weight of this fact.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: My god...
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: The geometry of mass infection
dialog: presents certain conceptual
dialog: re-evaluations for us. About our place
dialog: in their Colonization.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: This isn't Colonization, it's
dialog: spontaneous repopulation. All our
dialog: work... if it's true, then they've
dialog: been using us all along. We've been
dialog: laboring under a lie!
speaker_heading: 2ND ELDER
dialog: It could be an isolated case.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: How can we know?!
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: We're going to tell them what we've
dialog: found. What we've learned. Turn over a
text: body infected with the gestating
dialog: organism.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: In hope of what? Learning that it's
dialog: true?! That we are nothing more than
dialog: digestives for the creation of a new
dialog: race of alien lifeforms?!
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: Let me remind you who is the new race.
dialog: And who is the old.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What could be gained by withholding
dialog: anything from them; By pretending to
dialog: ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall
dialog: their plans to step up the timetable.
dialog: To start Colonization early.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: And if it doesn't? By cooperating now
dialog: we're but beggars to our demise! Our
dialog: ignorance was in cooperating with the
dialog: Colonists at all.
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: Cooperation is our only chance of
dialog: saving ourselves.
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: They still need us to carry out their
dialog: preparations.
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: We'll continue to use them as they do
dialog: us. If only to play for more time, to
dialog: continue work on our vaccine.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Our vaccine may have no effect!
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: Well, without a cure for the virus,
dialog: we're nothing more than digestives
dialog: anyway.
text: All eyes go to the Well-Manicured Man. He is respected,
dialog: if not the odd man out in this room. But he is all
text: restrained anger now.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: My lateness may have well been
dialog: absence. A course has already been
dialog: taken.
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: There are complications.
text: He turns back to the TV monitor where Mulder and Scully
text: remain frozen on the screen.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Do they know?
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: Mulder was in Dallas when we were
text: trying to dispose of evidence. He's
dialog: gone back there again. Someone has
dialog: tipped him.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Who?
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: Kurtzweil, we think.
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: We've allowed this man his freedom.
dialog: His books have actually helped us to
dialog: facilitate plausible denial. Has he
dialog: outlived his usefulness to us?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: No one believes Kurtzweil or his
dialog: books. He's a toiler. A crank.
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: And Mulder?
speaker_heading: ELDER
dialog: Our new situation makes us vulnerable.
dialog: If he learns information as we do, he
dialog: could jeopardize the Project's
dialog: secrecy.
speaker_heading: 2ND ELDER
dialog: Control of information means control
dialog: of Mulder.
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: I can control Mulder. I've always
dialog: controlled Mulder.
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: This may take another approach.
text: He says this, casting his look toward the Well-Manicured
text: Man. A look of cold malevolence. The W.M.M.'s reaction
text: is disdain.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: You can't kill Mulder. He's got too
text: much light on him.
speaker_heading: STRUGHOLD
dialog: You need not kill a man to destroy
dialog: him.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: (personalizing the
dialog: inference)
dialog: No, you need only take away what is
dialog: most precious to him.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL PUBLIC PARK - CENTRAL TEXAS - DAY
scene_heading: AGENT SCULLY
text: She stands against a backdrop of Texas flatland,
text: squinting into the sun. Shaking her head.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I don't know, Mulder...
dialog: We are:
text: WIDE ANGLE REVERSE, TO INCLUDE MULDER, standing in the
text: middle of a park, replete with jungle gyms, playground
text: equipment. All brand spanking new. They are standing
text: right where there had once been a hard scrabble, parched
text: and barren little field. Where the earthen hole had been
text: dug by the young boys. And what had later been the site
text: of so much activity by the group of scientists. But
text: where there's now a park, thick green grass covering the
text: parch of ground, including the spot where the hole had
dialog: been.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: He didn't mention a park.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: This is where he marked on the map,
dialog: Scully. Where he says those fossils
text: were unearthed.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I don't see any evidence of an
dialog: archeological or any other kind of
text: digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm
dialog: drain.
text: Mulder scans the area, confounded. Shaking his head as
dialog: they walk.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You're sure the fossils you looked at
text: showed the same signs of deterioration
dialog: you saw in the fireman's body in the
dialog: morgue?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (nodding)
text: The bone was porous, as if the virus
dialog: of the causative microbe were
text: digesting it.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: And you've never seen anything like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: No. It didn't show up on any of the
dialog: immunohistochemical tests --
text: Mulder is listening to all this while looking down at
dialog: his feet:
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: This looks like new grass to you?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: It looks pretty green for this
dialog: climate.
text: Mulder stops, kneels, touches the thick green carpet of
text: turf. He digs around, lifting up a corner of a new
dialog: square.
speaker_heading: MULDER
text: Ground's dry about an inch down.
dialog: Somebody just laid this down. Very
dialog: recently, I'd say.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (looking off)
text: All the equipment is brand new.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: No irrigation system. Somebody's
text: covering their tracks.
text: They both turn, looking at something that's caught their
text: attention on the street where their rental car is
text: parked. Three kids, all of whom we recognize from
dialog: earlier. Stevie's "friends".
text: Tooling down the street on new BMX bikes. Reacting to
text: Mulder's loud WHISTLE. This stops them, staring at
text: Mulder blankly across the distance.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Hey!
text: They don't answer. Just keep staring, squinting into the
text: sun. Mulder and Scully start walking toward them.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Do you live around here?
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: Yeah.
text: As the Agents approach.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You see anybody digging here?
text: The kids don't answer quickly.
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: Not supposed to talk about it.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: You're not supposed to talk about it?
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: 3RD BOY
dialog: Nobody.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Nobody. Same nobody who put this park
dialog: in? That new equipment...
dialog: (off the boys guilty looks)
dialog: They buy you these bikes?
text: The kids shift uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I think you better tell us.
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: We don't even know you.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Well, we're FBI agents.
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: You're not FBI agents.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: 2ND BOY
dialog: Cause FBI agents wear like suits and
dialog: goofy ties. And dresses like my mom
dialog: wears to church. Like on that one
dialog: show.
text: Mulder and Scully pull their badges. The kids' mouths
dialog: drop.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Maybe you've been watching too much
dialog: TV.
speaker_heading: 3RD BOY
text: They all left twenty minutes ago.
speaker_heading: 4TH BOY
dialog: Going that way.
text: The kids all pointing in the same direction.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL TEXAS HIGHWAY - LATE DAY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MULDER AND SCULLY'S RENTAL CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Mulder at the wheel, foot to the floor. Scully's got a

speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Unmarked tanker trucks... what are
text: archaeologists hauling out in tanker
dialog: trucks?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I don't know, Mulder.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: And where are they going with it?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: That's the first question to answer,
dialog: if we're going to find them.
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL HIGHWAY - LATE DAY
text: Mulder slows down to a stop. They've come to a three-way
text: intersection in the middle of absolutely nowhere that
text: offers them three choices. The car sits idling for
text: several beats.
scene_heading: RESUME INT. RENTAL CAR
text: Mulder's got his hand on his face rubbing his eyes.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What are my choices?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
text: About a hundred miles of nothing in
dialog: each direction.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Where would they be going?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: We've got two choices. One of them is
dialog: wrong.
text: They are both looking in different directions. The car
text: idling.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You think they went left?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I don't know why I think they went
dialog: right.
text: A few moments of silence. Then Mulder steps on the gas
text: and goes straight. Heading out onto the only unpaved
text: road. Accelerating away.
text: Scully looks at him, wondering. As they bump along at
text: speed. Mulder won't look at her for a few moments. Then,
dialog: turning to her:
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Five years together -- how many times
dialog: have I been wrong.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: HEADLIGHTS appear in the distance on a long, dusty
text: stretch of road. GROWING as they approach, then coming
text: to a stop in a cloud of dust as they move into f.g.
text: Where a LINE OF FENCEPOSTS, BARBWIRE blocks their path.
text: As the car brakes, the passenger door opens and Scully
text: exits. A hot Texas wind blows. A dog is BARKING
text: somewhere. Scully walks into the headlight wash, looking
text: at a sign on the fence.
text: After a moment, the driver's door opens and Mulder
dialog: exits.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Hey, I was right about the bomb,
dialog: wasn't I?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: This is great. This is fitting.
scene_heading: REVERSE ON SCENE
text: On the fence sign, painted in crude letters, are the
text: words: SOME HAVE TRIED, SOME HAVE DIED. TURN BACK -- NO
scene_heading: TRESPASSING.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I've got to be in Washington D.C. in
dialog: eleven hours for a hearing -- the
dialog: outcome of which might possibly affect
dialog: one of the biggest decisions of my
dialog: life. And here I am standing out in
text: the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing
text: phantom tanker trucks.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: We're not chasing trucks, we're
dialog: chasing evidence --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: -- of what exactly?!
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go
dialog: off, to hide something: bodies
dialog: infected with a virus you detected
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: They haul gas in tanker trucks, they
dialog: haul oil in tanker trucks -- they
dialog: don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Yeah, well they may this one.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: What do you mean by haul?
dialog: (off his reaction)
dialog: What are you not telling me here?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: This virus -- it...
dialog: (afraid to say)
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Mulder --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: It may be extraterrestrial.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I don't believe this. I don't fucking
dialog: believe this.
dialog: (reaching her limit of
dialog: impatience)
dialog: Y'know, I've been here... I've been
dialog: here one too many times with you,
text: Mulder.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Been where?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
text: Pounding down some dirt road in the
text: middle of the night. Chasing some
text: elusive truth on a dim hope, only to
dialog: find myself standing right where I am
dialog: right now: at another dead end --
text: As she says this A BELL starts to sound. A flashing
text: light hits Mulder and Scully. They both turn to see:
scene_heading: HIGH ANGLE OVER A RAILROAD CROSSING SIGN
text: Sitting all by its lonely self. No swinging arms or
text: gate. Just one little sign between Mulder and Scully and
dialog: their car.
text: CAMERA PANNING to the light of a locomotive speeding
dialog: toward us.
text: WIDE ANGLE OVER TRACKS TO MULDER AND SCULLY
text: They move toward their car, but the train is coming
text: fast. Mulder and Scully stop and wait, watching the
text: train. As the engine breaks frame, eclipsing Mulder and
text: Scully from view. And as it passes by we see TWO VERY
text: FAMILIAR WHITE TANKERS loaded piggyback atop flat bed
dialog: cars.
text: The train, which is not much longer than this, passes.
text: And Mulder and Scully make a mad dash for their car. The
text: lights come on and Mulder swings the vehicle into a hard
text: accelerating turn, taking the spoke of the intersection
text: that parallels the tracks. As the car hauls ass after
dialog: the train, we:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OPPOSITE END OF MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT
text: The rails come up a grade where they appear out of a
text: long bending turn. Exiting the mountain pass near the
text: summit of the mountain. And now HEADLIGHTS appear,
text: bouncing toward us. It's Mulder and Scully's rental
text: chugging up the grade.
text: And now pulling to a stop as it REACHES CAMERA. Then the
text: car doors open and Mulder and Scully exit. Putting
text: jackets against the cold desert night. Running over the
text: gravel on the rail bed into sharp f.g.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: What do you think it is?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I have no idea.
text: They start out toward it anyway, whatever it is. But the
dialog: image that we see next might cause us to ask the same
dialog: question.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE -- MULDER AND SCULLY'S FORMER POV
text: The Agents are moving off the tracks now, picking their
text: way toward the horizon where, at the edge of the great
text: plateau that lays out before them, there are TWO GIANT
text: GLOWING WHITE DOMES.
text: It is otherwise pitch dark out, almost giving the
text: impression that the domes are floating.
dialog: It would give the distinct impression of
dialog: otherworldliness, if we hadn't seen a similar, smaller
text: glowing dome over the dirt field where the boys found
dialog: the skull. And if we could not see the lights of the
text: TRAIN rolling to a stop near the mysterious domes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GREAT PLATEAU - NIGHT - HIGH WIDE ANGLE
text: SLOWLY CRANING DOWN as Mulder and Scully move through
text: the low scrub of the high desert. Moving towards us as
text: CAMERA CONTINUES ITS SLOW CRANE DOWN, REVEALING in f.g.
text: the tops of CORN STALKS (yes, corn stalks.) What is the
dialog: perimeter edge of:
scene_heading: REVERSE CRANE DOWN (TO MATCH)
text: Acres and acres of corn fields, laying out before us in
text: the dark night. Running all the way to the WHITE DOMED
text: TENTS in the b.g.
text: Mulder and Scully enter the perimeter edge, disappearing
dialog: into:
scene_heading: EXT. ACRES OF CORN - NIGHT
text: TRACKING WITH Mulder and Scully as they move through the
dialog: field.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: This is weird, Mulder.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Very weird.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Any thoughts on why anybody'd be
text: growing corn in the middle of the
dialog: desert?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop
text: containers out there.
text: CONTINUE TRACKING as they move through the tall uniform
dialog: rows.
scene_heading: ANGLE BEHIND THE AGENTS
text: Shooting down the long straight rows. CRANING UP to
text: REVEAL DOMES once again. Like space ships that have
dialog: landed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: OPPOSITE PERIMETER OF THE FIELD OF CORN
text: The Agents exit the edge of the crop field. They have
text: come upon the glowing tents now. Tall and pillowy
text: against the dark sky.
text: There is no evidence of anyone about. No sound, no
dialog: signs.
text: Mulder and Scully stand at the edge of the field for a
text: moment. Then move cautiously across an open area to one
text: of the domes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHITE DOME TENT - NIGHT
text: Mulder pulls open the steel door leading in. It opens
text: with a SUCKING SOUND which suggests the interior is
text: pressurized. And as he and Scully step in -- they both
text: JUMP when LARGE FANS just overhead hit them both with
text: hard blasts of air.
text: Stepping quickly out of the downward blasting air, into
text: the still silence of the space beyond.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Cool in here. Temperature's being
dialog: regulated.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: For the purpose of what?
scene_heading: HIGH OVERHEAD ANGLE
text: Our view is down through the crosswires and cables that
dialog: create the tension support. The effect is a combination
text: of simplicity and perfect function. Stark and high tech.
text: The flooring is gray and flat, featureless. But we don't
text: yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed
text: tent houses.
text: Though the air is still and there is no movement of any
text: kind, there is a sound that permeates the interior. A
text: STEADY HUM. Almost electrical hum, but different.
text: Mulder and Scully move together toward the middle of the
dialog: space.
scene_heading: WIDE ON TENT - MULDER AND SCULLY'S POV
text: Laid out in a grid, low to the ground, are what look
text: like BOXES. Fixed in place like roof vents, except these
text: are on the floor, no more than three feet tall, and
text: about the same measure square.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - TRACKING WITH MULDER AND SCULLY
text: As they continue to move cautiously, walking out into
text: the grid of box-shaped objects. Coming to the center of
text: the capacious, arena-sized space. Standing over one of
text: the mysterious boxes, which we now see have LOUVERED
text: TOPS. The louvers, however, are shut so that whatever is
text: inside the boxes cannot be seen.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I think we're on top of something. I
dialog: think these are some kind of venting.
text: Mulder lays his head and ear to the top of the box.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You hear that?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
text: I hear the humming. Like electricity.
dialog: High voltage maybe.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Maybe. Maybe not.
text: Scully looks skyward.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: What do you think those are for?
text: Mulder takes his ear off the box, looking up now, too.
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: At the top of the dome are two LARGE corresponding
scene_heading: LOUVER VENTS.
scene_heading: RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY
text: Looking up at these vents.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHITE DOME TENT - NIGHT
text: HIGH WIDE ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY, staring up JUST
text: PAST CAMERA at the louvered vents at top center of the
text: tent. When A LOUD METALLIC NOISE makes them jump.
scene_heading: AGENTS POV THE LOUVERED VENTS ABOVE THEM
text: One of the vents is opening automatically, its large
text: metal louvers straining from their flat closed position
text: into an up-and-down open position. When this is
text: complete, the SECOND LOUVER does the same.
text: The straining sound of galvanized metal-on-metal.
text: LOW ANGLE ON MULDER AND SCULLY
text: As Mulder turns his look from the ceiling back down to
text: the mysterious box they're standing next to. Something
text: occurs to him. Something frightening.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Scully....?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Yeah...?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Run.
text: Mulder grabs her hand, pulling her along. Though she
text: doesn't know why. Or what's about to happen. TRACKING
text: FAST WITH THEM as Mulder leads her back toward the door
text: they entered, which is a good hundred yards away.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (yelling, on the run)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (yelling back)
dialog: Come on!
text: When the LOUVERED VENTS on all the low grid-arranged
scene_heading: boxes OPEN IN DOMINO-LIKE SUCCESSION -- out of them
text: pouring THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BEES, rapidly filling
text: the atmosphere of the domed space.
text: As if the insects are being shot out of non-stop
dialog: cannons.
speaker_heading: HIGH ANGLE
text: THICK STREAMS of bees head RIGHT AT CAMERA, flying for
text: the open louvers at the top of the dome. As Mulder and
text: Scully run for it down below.
text: TRACKING WITH MULDER AND SCULLY
text: Scully's hand slipping from Mulder's as she pulls her
text: jacket up over her head. Mulder doing the same now,
text: ducking his head inside his own jacket. The Agents are
text: slowed by the bees but still make their zigzag way
text: toward the door -- bees clinging to their clothes. But
text: motion seems to be the key.
text: As Mulder RUNS TOWARD CAMERA -- where the downward blast
text: of air knocks all the bees off him. In the b.g., we see
text: that Scully has fallen behind. Still running, but losing
text: her way in the process, losing her bearings as the
text: thickening swarm of bees descends.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON SCULLY
text: When Mulder enters frame, jacket pulled over his head
text: again. Taking Scully by the back of her coat and
text: swinging her toward the direction of the door.
text: Whipsnapping her the rest of the distance to the
text: doorfans. Following right behind her as the fans
text: BLASTING them and the Agents continue right out the
dialog: doors. To:
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE DOMED TENT - NIGHT
text: Scully and Mulder comes blasting out themselves now, but
text: they haven't even had time to catch their breaths when
text: they react to MOVEMENT. Something coming at them in the
dialog: night.
scene_heading: THEIR POV'S - STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROWS OF DOMED TENTS
text: Where BRIGHT BEAMS BLAST ON, moving fast toward them.
text: The RUSHING WHIR of the turbine engines of the unmarked
text: choppers. The bright beams skimming across the ground
text: toward Mulder and Scully, traveling right along the
text: edges of ends of the white domed tents. Threatening to
dialog: spot the Agents, unless they -- RUN.
text: And they do -- bolting just as the beams and the
text: helicopters blast over the spot they held just moments
dialog: before. Running to:
scene_heading: EXT. ACRES OF CORN - NIGHT - MULDER AND SCULLY - VARIOUS
speaker_heading: HANDHELD
text: Running flat out now, knocking away the stalks and
text: leaves that block their way.
text: Following and leading shots.
text: POVs and Tracking shots.
text: And chasing angles, as the Agents run through the only
dialog: cover they've got. As:
text: ANGLE JUST OVER THE TOP OF CROPS
text: The unmarked helicopters swoop right overhead, their
text: BRIGHT SPOTLIGHTS searching and cutting through the
text: cornrows. As the Agents zig and zag just out of the
text: discovering beams. As the choppers zoom right over their
dialog: heads.
scene_heading: REVERSE ON CHOPPERS
text: Traversing the field, then doing sharp banking turns and
text: swooping back over the field now in low drifting hovers.
text: The wash from the blades knocking the corn stalks down
dialog: so as to reveal anything hidden within.
text: The bright spots making sure that nothing might escape
dialog: detection.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - CAMERA SEARCHING AND FINDING SCULLY
text: as she runs up INTO FRAME. She's lost sight of:
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Mulder?!
scene_heading: ANGLE ELSEWHERE ON MULDER
text: As he too runs to a stop. Hearing his name.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Scully?!
speaker_heading: RESUME SCULLY
text: Reacting to the sound of her name, but there's no time
text: to find her bearings on Mulder. Not before she has to
text: take flight again. As one of the choppers appears
text: overhead, hovering into view. Knocking the corn down in
text: a path moving straight toward her.
text: CAMERA LEADING HER as she runs from the oncoming craft.
text: PASSING CAMERA to the left, as the chopper passes CAMERA
speaker_heading: RIGHT.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: TRACKING FAST WITH MULDER
text: Beating his way through the corn like Bomba through the
dialog: jungle.
text: Matching this action, as Mulder runs toward us. When one
text: of the unmarked helicopters BREAKS INTO FRAME in an
text: intersecting path, its BEAM passing right over Mulder
text: and ILLUMINATING HIM. But while it doesn't slow Mulder
text: down, the helicopter maneuvers into a hard banking turn,
text: sweeping over the far end of the corn field and heading
scene_heading: RIGHT BACK AT MULDER - AT US.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: NEW LOW ANGLE ON EDGE OF CORN FIELD
text: Where Mulder bursts out of the perimeter, turning on a
text: quick dime and running an out pattern, just before the
text: chopper BURSTS into frame overhead, its search beam
text: narrowly missing Mulder.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE ON MULDER
text: Running the corner of the field, looking frantically
text: down each corn row until he comes to a stop. No sign
dialog: of:
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Scully?!
text: Mulder reacting to the sound of her response:
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (distant o.s.)
dialog: Mulder!
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE ON SCULLY
text: She's exiting the field behind him. Running toward him,
text: and when she gets to him they both break into a run
text: across the desert. CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM as they sprint
dialog: away.
text: FOLLOWING THEM until they both start to slow. Slowing to
text: a stop in the darkness. Turning to see:
speaker_heading: THEIR POV
text: The helicopters have disappeared.
scene_heading: RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY
text: Reacting to this.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Where'd they go?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I don't know.
text: Then they both turn again and continue running. As fast
text: as their feet will take them. Back towards the bluff
text: where their car is parked.
scene_heading: EXT. BLUFF OVERLOOKING CORN FIELDS - NIGHT
text: Where Mulder and Scully's car is parked. Stillness,
text: until Mulder and Scully's heads appear as they climb up
text: from the direction of the corn fields. They get in their
text: car and start it quickly. Mulder turns the ignition, but
text: the car doesn't start immediately. He turns it over and
dialog: over but it won't kick.
text: As he does this, unbeknownst to the agents ONE OF THE
text: BLACK HELICOPTERS rises up from below the bluff,
text: appearing in their rear windshield. Hovering just behind
text: the car like a giant bumblebee. Just as...
text: ...Mulder gets the car started, throwing the
text: transmission in gear and spinning the tires. As they
text: head off back in the direction they came, without their
text: lights on. As they do this, the black chopper continues
text: to hover for a moment, then BANKS OFF AND AWAY. Into the
dialog: night.
text: Mulder and Scully speed off in the opposite direction.
dialog: As we:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE ON A FILE
text: Being leafed through by a woman's hands. CAMERA TILTING
dialog: UP to Special Agent Cassidy, the woman we met earlier
text: running the OPR hearing. She takes a quick glance at her
dialog: watch, looking up when:
scene_heading: THE DOOR TO THE ROOM
text: opens. A beat, then Skinner enters with a wearied look.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
text: She's coming in.
text: Skinner ducks his head back out to look at:
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OPR HEARING ROOM - DAY
text: Where Scully stands looking into the glass of a display
text: case, trying to put her hair and clothes and person
text: together. She's still in the same clothes we saw her in.
text: Seeing Skinner now moving toward him.
scene_heading: RESUME OPR HEARING ROOM
text: Scully enters past Skinner. Though she has straightened
text: them, and her hair, there is no mistaking that she's
dialog: been to the dust bowl and back to get here. Her manner
text: is chastened.
text: Scully tries to keep her eyes on the table where she'll
text: be sitting. Venturing only a brief, polite look to:
text: ANGLE TO INCLUDE CASSIDY AND THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS
text: They reshuffle their papers, pulling up their chairs.
dialog: Ready to get down to business now.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Special Agent Scully --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I apologize for making you wait --
dialog: I've brought some new evidence with me
dialog: --
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Evidence of what?
scene_heading: CLOSE PROFILE ON SCULLY
text: Reaching into her satchel, pulling out an evidence bag.
text: Whatever she's reaching for she's reluctant to present
dialog: with confidence.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
text: These are fossilized bone fragments
dialog: I've been able to study, gathered from
dialog: the bomb site in Dallas...
text: As Scully speaks we see A BEE crawl out from under the
text: collar of her suit jacket, crawling toward the back of
text: her neck. Crawling slowly, as if stretching its legs
text: from its long journey. CAMERA DOLLYING around Scully as
text: the bee does, moving into an OVER to:
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: You've been back to Dallas?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Are you going to let us in on what
dialog: exactly you're trying to prove --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: That the bombing in Dallas may have
dialog: been to destroy the bodies of those
dialog: firemen, so their deaths and the
dialog: reason for them wouldn't have to be
dialog: explained --
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: (challenging)
dialog: -- those are very serious allegations,
dialog: Agent Scully --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Yes. I know.
text: There is a hush of murmured responses to this, the panel
text: members speaking to one another. Assistant Director
text: Skinner shifts uneasily in his chair. He's been here
text: before with Agents Mulder and Scully. He's sensing
dialog: something outrageous.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: And you have conclusive evidence of
dialog: this? Something to tie this claim of
dialog: yours to the crime --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (grudgingly)
dialog: Nothing completely conclusive --
text: We have returned to the OVER ANGLE on Scully, where we
text: see the BEE just below her jacket collar on the back of
text: her neck.
text: It CRAWLS back under her collar, DISAPPEARING from
dialog: sight.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I hope to. We're working to develop
dialog: this evidence --
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Working with?
speaker_heading: SCULLY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - LATE DAY
text: Mulder pushes through the front, scanning the room for:
scene_heading: ANGLE ON KURTZWEIL
text: Sitting at a booth at the dark rear of the
text: establishment. Mulder enters frame, sitting down across
text: from him. Kurtzweil is jumpy, but he sees from Mulder's
dialog: expression that something's up.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: You found something?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of
dialog: experiment. Something they excavated
text: was brought there in tanker trucks.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I'm not sure. A virus --
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: -- You saw this experiment?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What did it look like?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: There were bees. And corn crops.
text: Kurtzweil smiles at Mulder, laughs with nervous
text: excitement. Mulder doesn't quite realize it yet, but
text: this is news to him.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What are they?
text: Kurtzweil slides from his seat, rising.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: A transportation system. Transgenic
dialog: crops. The pollen genetically altered
dialog: to carry a virus.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: That would be my guess.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Your guess?
text: But Kurtzweil doesn't respond to this. He's moving
text: toward the back of the bar. Mulder slides out, pursuing
dialog: him.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BARMAID
text: The few PATRONS sitting at the bar, all turning in
text: reaction to this sudden flurry of activity.
scene_heading: INT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Near the bathrooms. Mulder catches up to Kurtzweil.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What do you mean, your guess?
text: Kurtzweil doesn't stop. So Mulder must physically stop
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You told me you had answers.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Yeah, well I don't have them all.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You've been using me --
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: I've been using you?!
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You didn't know my father --
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: I told you -- he and I were old
dialog: friends --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You're a liar. You lied to me to
dialog: gather information for you. For your
dialog: goddamn books. Didn't you?
text: Mulder is getting heated, rough with Kurtzweil. When,
text: unexpectedly A MAN suddenly exits the bathroom. REACTING
text: to this scene. Kurtzweil uses the moment to break from
text: Mulder. Slipping out the back door. Mulder takes a beat,
text: then goes after him.
text: Pushing out the back door into the blinding brightness.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - DAY
text: Mulder busts out the back door, chasing Kurtzweil.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Kurtzweil!
text: Kurtzweil turns to him. With restrained ferocity.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: You'd be shit out of luck if not for
dialog: me. You saw what you saw because I led
dialog: you to it. I'm putting my ass on the
dialog: line for you.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Your ass? I just got chased across
text: Texas by two black helicopters.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: And why do you think it is you're
dialog: standing here talking to me? These
dialog: people don't make mistakes, Agent
text: Mulder.
text: And with that he turns now, striding off. Leaving Mulder
dialog: to deal with the excellent logic of this. When suddenly
text: Mulder reacts to A NOISE. Somewhere above him.
speaker_heading: MULDER'S POV
text: Up on a fire escape, A MAN is moving. Mulder can only
text: see his feet and legs from this angle, but it is clear
text: he has been watching Mulder. Upon being spotted, the
text: figure slides away and disappears.
scene_heading: ANGLE FROM INSIDE FIRE ESCAPE BUILDING
text: We get a glimpse of the man who was watching him. A face
text: we recognize as that of the man who brushed past Mulder
text: coming out of the vending room, not long before the
text: building in Dallas blew. He is moving quickly now,
text: disappearing into the shadows. CAMERA TILTING DOWN to
dialog: find:
text: MULDER. He stands staring up, but only for a moment
text: until he turns and hurries off in the opposite direction
text: Kurtzweil disappeared in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - MAGIC HOUR
text: ANGLE OVER MULDER'S DESK at the far end of the living
text: room. The sound of keys in the door, then Mulder enters
text: his apartment in a hurry. Moving to the desk and going
text: at this pace through the drawers. Looking for... A
scene_heading: PICTURE ALBUM.
text: Which he takes now, leafing through it. Flipping the
dialog: pages, looking for:
scene_heading: ANGLE OVER MULDER
text: Finding old pictures of young Fox Mulder with his
text: SISTER, Samantha. With his father and mother. The
text: plastic-covered page is peeled back and one of these
text: photos is removed. It is an old family snapshot. A
dialog: picnic possibly.
text: Mulder stares at the picture.
text: INSERT PHOTO - In the b.g. of the picnic, his head
text: turned to camera, is a young KURTZWEIL.
text: Mulder studies the photo intensely, when there's a KNOCK
text: at his door. Mulder turning to see:
speaker_heading: SCULLY
text: In his haste, Mulder had neglected to lock his door.
text: Scully is pushing it open. She's still in the same
text: clothes. She looks beat. Her eyes meeting Mulder's. A
text: gaze that says bad news.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer
dialog: effective immediately.
text: Mulder is shaking his head. Not wanting to hear this.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I already gave Skinner my letter of
dialog: resignation.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You can't quit, Scully.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I can, Mulder. I debated whether or
dialog: not to even tell you in person,
dialog: because I knew --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: We're close to something here -- we're
dialog: on the verge --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: You're on the verge, Mulder -- please
dialog: don't do this to me --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: After what you saw last night -- after
dialog: all you've seen -- you can't just walk
dialog: away --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I have. I did. It's done.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Just like that --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I'm contacting the state board Monday
dialog: to file medical reinstatement papers
dialog: --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I need you on this, Scully --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: You don't Mulder -- you've never
dialog: needed me. I've only held you back.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've got to go.
text: And with that she exits his apartment, the argument too
text: painful, and her ability to be persuaded too clear to
dialog: herself.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: WIDE ANGLE FROM END OF HALL where we see Scully,
text: leaving Mulder's apartment. Moving at a hurried clip to
text: the elevator -- TOWARD CAMERA. As if anticipating her
text: own impulse to turn around and go back. As she moves
text: into f.g. Mulder exits his apt. door.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You're wrong --
text: He hurries to catch her. As she turns on him.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Why was I assigned to you? To debunk
dialog: your work. To reign you in. To shut
dialog: you down.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You saved me, Scully.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: As different and frustrating as it's
dialog: been sometimes, your goddamn strict
dialog: rationalism and science have saved me
dialog: a thousand times; have kept me honest
dialog: and made me whole. I owe you so much,
dialog: Scully, and you owe me nothing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't want to do this without you. I
dialog: don't know if I can. If I quit now,
dialog: they win.
text: She is silent, moved. In spite of all her desire not to
text: be. She moves to Mulder, holds him. They break slightly
text: and she looks up at Mulder with deep respect, admiration
dialog: and... kisses him on the forehead. When...
dialog: ...suddenly a physical intimacy we've never seen. A
dialog: heat and passion that can't be denied. The opportunity
text: for the inevitable has presented itself.
text: The moment of truth has arrived. Mulder is staring at
text: Scully as she's looking back at him. His head moves
text: slightly toward hers -- as one of his hands moves up to
text: her neck, drawing her to him. Where there is hesitation
dialog: on her part, there is also desire. When:
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: OUCH!!!
text: Scully pulls away from Mulder, RUBBING at her neck where
text: his hand had been.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What? What happened?
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I think... something stung me.
text: Scully's hand comes out with THE SQUIRMING BEE, which
text: she holds in her hand while Mulder moves around her,
text: checking her neck.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: It must...
text: But he doesn't finish his sentence before he has to
text: catch Scully from falling. Her head bobs and she has to
dialog: catch it.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Scully...
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Something's wrong...
dialog: (fighting for clarity)
dialog: I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my
dialog: chest. My... motor functions are being
dialog: affected. I'm...
text: Mulder lays her down on the floor during this. Scully
text: continues to speak, though her eyes are not focusing.
text: She is limp in Mulder's arms.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
text: ...my pulse feels thready and I've
dialog: got a funny taste in the back of my
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I think you're in anaphylactic shock
dialog: --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: No -- it's --
text: Her voice is getting thin now, too.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Scully --
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I've got no allergy. Something...
dialog: this... Mulder... I think... I think
dialog: you should call an ambulance.
text: And Mulder is on his feet in a flash, running for:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: CLOSE OVER PHONE as Mulder races into the apartment,
text: dashing TOWARD CAMERA, picking up the receiver, dialing.
text: HOLDING ON THE PHONE during this action. TILTING UP
dialog: for:
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I
dialog: have an emergency -- I have an agent
dialog: down --
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
scene_heading: SCULLY - HANDHELD
text: Picked up and one-two-three loaded on a gurney by TWO
text: PARAMEDICS.
speaker_heading: 1ST PARAMEDIC
dialog: Can you hear me? Can you say your
dialog: name?
text: Scully is trying, but the words won't come out.
speaker_heading: 1ST PARAMEDIC
text: She's got constriction in the throat
dialog: and larynx -- are you breathing okay?
text: He lays his head down to her mouth.
speaker_heading: 1ST PARAMEDIC
dialog: Passages are open. Let's get her in
dialog: the van --
text: NEIGHBORS are in the hall now, along with Mulder. Who is
text: moving beside the Paramedics as they hustle the gurney
text: down the hall.
speaker_heading: 1ST PARAMEDIC
dialog: Coming through people -- here we go.
dialog: Coming through --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MULDER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUED HAND HELD
text: The Paramedics bang out the front door, stutter-stepping
text: the gurney down to the walk, to their EMT VAN which sits
text: at the curb with the LIGHT BAR FLASHING. Mulder
text: following close by.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: She said she had a taste in the back
dialog: of her throat -- there was no
dialog: pre-existing allergy to bee-stings --
dialog: the bee that stung her may have been
dialog: carrying a virus --
speaker_heading: 2ND PARAMEDIC
dialog: A virus?
speaker_heading: 1ST PARAMEDIC
dialog: Get on the radio, tell them we have a
dialog: cytogenic reaction, we need an advise
dialog: and administer --
text: They get her to the back of the vehicle, guiding the
text: gurney in with experienced hands. Scully's eyes are on
text: Mulder as she's slid into the brightly lit interior.
text: The 1st Paramedic blocks Mulder somewhat as he steps
text: toward the van, anticipating that he's going with them
text: to the hospital. But the doors are closing on him before
text: he gets an opportunity.
text: FOLLOWING MULDER around to the driver's side of the van
text: now, moving to the driver's window where THE DRIVER can
text: be seen in the rear view mirror, his eyes watching
text: Mulder.
speaker_heading: ON MULDER
text: A moment of vague recognition -- a catch in his step.
speaker_heading: RESUME
text: As Mulder's momentum carries him to the driver's window
text: where se see again the man from the vending room, who
text: was also surveilling Mulder. And he has a HANDGUN
text: pointed at Mulder, which he FIRES THROUGH THE WINDOW.
text: The glass shattering.
speaker_heading: RESUME MULDER
text: Throwing himself away backward, but the bullet catches
text: him in the head. Blood and glass spraying onto the side
text: of the van. He goes down to the ground -- as the
text: paramedic van accelerates fast away.
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE REVERSE ON MULDER
text: Lying in the street, his head bleeding profusely. While
text: in the b.g., A SECOND AMBULANCE IS SPEEDING TO THE
text: SCENE. As it skids to a stop and TWO NEW PARAMEDICS jump
dialog: out, we:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT
text: A MEDIUM SIZED PRIVATE JET is taxiing down an alley off
text: the main runway where a 747 is speeding toward takeoff.
text: The private jet turning TOWARD CAMERA and nosing into
dialog: f.g.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE ON TARMAC
text: Where MEN IN FAMILIAR BLACK FATIGUES are unloading
text: something from an unmarked cube truck that is also
text: familiar: the very high tech-looking CLEAR CONTAINER,
text: with its monitors and gauges, its oxygen tanks and
text: refrigeration unit. A self-contained life support
text: system. The inside of the container is covered with a
text: thin layer of frost, through which we can see AGENT
scene_heading: SCULLY.
text: She lies as if in a state of paralysis, but a blink of
text: her eyes is enough to tell us that she is... alive.
text: TRACKING WITH THE MEN moving the container. As they
text: hustle it to the waiting jet. As The Cigarette Smoking
text: Man is descending the steps of the plane onto the
text: tarmac. Watching as the container is moved to the cargo
text: hold and loaded inside.
text: The hold is closed and the jet engines wind back up. As
text: the Cigarette Smoking Man reboards the aircraft and it
text: taxis away.
text: FADE SLOWLY TO BLACK
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Voices fade in slowly, inaudible at first. For regular
text: viewers of the show, they will recognize the voices of
dialog: the Lone Gunmen.
text: Three nerdish paranoiacs who publish a magazine which
text: charts and cataloged conspiracies past and present,
text: among other government malfeasance. They are Langly,
dialog: Byers and Frohike.
speaker_heading: BYERS
dialog: I think he's coming out --
speaker_heading: LANGLY
dialog: He's coming to.
speaker_heading: FROHIKE
dialog: Hey, Mulder...
text: FADE UP, as if our eyes are blinking open. We are in
text: Mulder's POV, and the face right above us is Frohike's.
speaker_heading: FROHIKE
dialog: Mulder...?
text: Behind Frohike, looking down at Mulder, are Byers and
dialog: Langly.
scene_heading: REVERSE ON MULDER
text: Staring at the diminutive Frohike, the long-haired
text: Langly and the courtly Byers with dawning recognition.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Oh god...
speaker_heading: LANGLY
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (to Byers, then Langly)
dialog: Tin Man. Scarecrow.
dialog: (to Frohike)
dialog: Toto.
text: Mulder sits up now, rubbing his face, feeling the
text: BANDAGE he's got on his head.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What am I doing here?
speaker_heading: BYERS
dialog: You were shot in the head. The bullet
dialog: broke the flesh on your right brow and
dialog: glanced off your temporal plate.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (woozy)
dialog: Penetration but not perforation.
speaker_heading: LANGLY
dialog: Three centimetres to the left and we'd
dialog: be playing the harp.
text: Mulder is still shaking out the cobwebs.
speaker_heading: BYERS
dialog: They gave you a craniotomy to relieve
text: the pressure from a subdural hematoma.
dialog: But you've been unconscious since they
dialog: brought you in.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: When was that?
speaker_heading: FROHIKE
dialog: Two days ago. Your guy Skinner's been
dialog: here with you around the clock.
speaker_heading: LANGLY
dialog: We got the news and made a trip to
dialog: your apartment. Found a bug in your
dialog: phone line.
speaker_heading: FROHIKE
dialog: And one in your hall.
text: Byers holds up the first small device. Frohike holds up
text: a vial containing A BEE. Mulder realizing:
speaker_heading: MULDER
text: Scully had a violent reaction to a bee
dialog: sting --
speaker_heading: BYERS
dialog: You called 911. Except the call was
dialog: intercepted.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: They took her --
text: Mulder pushes the covers off. Swinging his legs to the
text: ground. As A.D. Skinner enters the room. Surprised to
dialog: see Mulder up.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: Agent Mulder --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Where's Scully?!
text: As he says this he loses his balance slightly, has to
text: hold onto one of the Gunmen. Struggling with his
dialog: faculties.
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: She's missing. We've been unable to
dialog: locate her or the vehicle they took
dialog: her in.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Whoever they are -- this goes right
dialog: back to Dallas -- it goes right back
dialog: to the bombing --
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: I know.
dialog: (off Mulder's reaction to
dialog: this)
dialog: Agent Scully reported your suspicions
dialog: to OPR. On the basis of her report, I
text: sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's
text: apartment. They picked up PSTN
dialog: residues on his personal effects
dialog: consistent with the construction of
text: the vending machine device in Dallas.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (reeling)
dialog: How deep does this go?
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: I don't know.
text: Mulder sees A MAN IN A SUIT passes by the small window
text: in the door, casting a furtive glance in, then moving
text: off. He turns his look back to Skinner.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Are we being watched?
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: I'm not taking any chances.
text: Mulder nods. Pulling now at the bandage on his head.
text: Peeling it away and revealing the wound beneath.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I need your clothes, Byers.
speaker_heading: BYERS
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: SKINNER
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I've got to find Scully.
speaker_heading: FROHIKE
dialog: Do you know where she is?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: No. But I know someone who might have
dialog: an answer. Who better.
text: Mulder is undoing his hospital gown now, his white buns
text: gracing the screen for the first time in history. As he
text: ducks into the bathroom. As the men left standing in the
text: room all look to Byers, reluctantly removing his duds.
dialog: Off this:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: ANGLE OVER MAN IN A SUIT standing with his back to
text: Mulder's room, reading a section of a newspaper (the
text: rest of the paper sitting on a chair, as if the man's
text: possibly set up here.) As the door to Mulder's room
text: opens in the b.g. and Frohike appears.
text: Frohike keeps his eyes on the Man as Langly appears now,
text: followed by...Byers? We can't see clearly as the other
text: two block our POV and the third man out doesn't show us
text: his face. The threesome starts down the hall, their
text: footsteps drawing the attention of the Man in a Suit.
scene_heading: ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE OTHER GUNMEN
text: As they head TOWARD CAMERA. Walking at a pace. In the
text: b.g. the Man in the Suit is drifting toward Mulder's
dialog: hospital room.
text: ANGLE ON MAN IN SUIT
text: Suspicious. He moves to the door, looks in the little
text: glass window. Seeing...Byers, the sheets pulled up to
text: his nose to hide his beard and mustache. Skinner
text: standing next to him, talking on the phone.
text: The Man in the Suit looking down to the end of the hall
dialog: again.
scene_heading: RESUME ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE GUNMEN
text: As Mulder and his two flankers MOVE RIGHT TO CAMERA.
text: Mulder is taking a cell phone being handed to him by
text: Frohike. Dialing on the move.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT
text: A FIGURE appears at the end of the alley, moving toward
dialog: us. It could be Mulder from this distance, but as the
text: figure comes closer we recognize him as Kurtzweil.
text: Moving into the f.g., checking behind him, ahead of him.
dialog: Jumpy.
text: He takes a cautious beat, then moves to the door leading
text: into the bar (established), reaching for the knob.
text: Opening it, finding the Well-Manicured Man standing
dialog: there.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Dr. Kurtzweil, isn't it? Dr. Alvin
dialog: Kurtzweil?
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: Kurtzweil is shaken by the sight of this man.
text: Backpedaling a bit, looking around and behind him for an
dialog: ambush.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: You're surprised. Certainly you've
dialog: been expecting some response to your
text: indiscretion.
text: The W.M.M. steps out of the doorway, following
dialog: Kurtzweil.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: I'm quite sure whatever you told Agent
dialog: Mulder, you have your good reason.
dialog: It's a weakness in men our age; the
dialog: urge to confess.
dialog: (stopping his walk)
dialog: I forgive you that.
text: Kurtzweil is thrown by the words, and the delivery.
text: Stopping his backward progress. Studying this upright
dialog: and civil man.
speaker_heading: KURTZWEIL
dialog: What are you doing here? What do you
dialog: want from me?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: You must try to understand, what I'm
dialog: here to do is only to protect my
dialog: children. You and I have but short
dialog: lives left. I can only hope the same
dialog: isn't true for them.
text: On this note, Kurtzweil turns and hoofs it back in the
text: direction from which he came. TRACKING BACK WITH HIM
text: until HEADLIGHTS hit his face.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: A TOWN CAR has pulled into the alley behind him.
text: Accelerating fast down the narrow corridor. Effectively
text: trapping Kurtzweil in. As he squints into its
text: headlights, then turns back with fear in his eyes to the
dialog: W.M.M.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT
text: Where a figure is coming down the street toward us.
text: Running, it's Mulder, going balls out. Running to the
text: entrance of the bar and yanking open the door.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNSCALE D.C. BAR - NIGHT
text: Moderately crowded as Mulder enters, stopping to catch
text: his breath. Moving to the back of the bar. Looking for:
text: THE BOOTH WHERE HE MET KURTZWEIL EARLIER
text: It's empty.
speaker_heading: RESUME MULDER
text: Moving through the bar -- real panic in his expression.
text: He heads to the back.
scene_heading: INT. REAR OF DOWNSCALE BAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Mulder passing the bathrooms, moving to the door where
text: we saw the Well-Manicured Man standing just a short bit
text: ago. But there is no one back here now. Mulder moves to
text: the back door, the one leading to the alley, pushing it
dialog: open and finding:
text: The Well-Manicured Man stands with HIS DRIVER closing
text: the trunk on the idling Town Car (which has been turned
text: around.) The W.M.M. turns to see:
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Mr. Mulder.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What happened to Kurtzweil?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
text: He's come and gone.
text: The W.M.M. moves to Mulder, who doesn't trust him for a
text: second. Mulder is still breathing hard, sizing up this
dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Where's Scully?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: I have answers for you.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Is she alive?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Yes.
text: Mulder stares at the W.M.M. - measuring him.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: I'm quite prepared to tell you
dialog: everything, though there isn't much
dialog: you haven't guessed.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: About the conspiracy?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: I think of it as an agreement. A word
dialog: your father liked to use.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: I want to know where Scully is.
text: The Well-Manicured Man suddenly reaches into his jacket
text: pocket, without warning or explanation. Mulder tensing
text: slightly. He removes a thin felt envelope.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: The location of Agent Scully. And the
dialog: means to save her life.
dialog: (off Mulder's look)
dialog: Please...
text: He gestures toward the car where the Driver stands with
text: the back door open. Mulder hesitates, then steps from
text: the doorway. Moving past the W.M.M., sliding in. The
text: W.M.M. gets in after him, closes the door. The car pulls
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: WE SEE MULDER in the back seat, reflected in the
text: rear-view mirror. Where we also see the eyes of the
text: DRIVER watching him. Mulder is handed the felt envelope
dialog: by the W.M.M.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: A weak vaccine against the virus Agent
text: Scully has been infected with. It must
dialog: be administered with ninety six
dialog: hours.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're lying.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: No. Though I have no way to prove
dialog: otherwise. The virus is
dialog: extraterrestrial. We know very little
dialog: about it, except that it is the
dialog: original inhabitant of this planet.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (dubious, to say the least)
dialog: A virus?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
text: A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What
text: is a virus but a colonizing force that
dialog: cannot be defeated? Living in a cave,
text: underground, until it mutates. And
dialog: attacks.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: This is what you've been conspiring to
dialog: conceal? A disease?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: No! For God sake you've got it all
dialog: backwards.
text: This outburst comes suddenly, unexpectedly.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Aids, the ebola virus -- on the
dialog: evolutionary scale they are newborns.
dialog: This virus walked the planet long
dialog: before the dinosaurs.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What do you mean, walked?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little
dialog: green men, first landed here millions
dialog: of years ago. Those that didn't leave
dialog: have been laying dormant underground
text: since the last Ice Age. In the form of
dialog: an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be
text: reconstituted when the alien race from
dialog: which it came returns to colonize the
dialog: planet. Using us as hosts. Against
dialog: this we have no defense. Nothing but a
dialog: weak vaccine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you see why it was kept secret? Why
dialog: even the best men -- men like your
dialog: father -- could not let the truth be
dialog: known?
text: The force and conviction of his delivery leave Mulder
text: shaken.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Until Dallas, we believed the virus
dialog: was simply a controlling organism.
dialog: That mass infection would make us a
dialog: slave race.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: That's why you bombed the building.
dialog: The infected firemen, the boy --
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Imagine our surprise when they began
dialog: to gestate. My group has been working
text: cooperatively with the alien
dialog: colonists, facilitating their
dialog: programs. To give us access to the
dialog: virus. In false hope we might be able
dialog: to secretly find a cure. So that we
dialog: might save ourselves, as the last of
dialog: the species.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your father wisely refused to believe
text: this, choosing hope over selfishness.
dialog: Hope is the only future he had: his
dialog: children,
dialog: (beat, then self-revealing)
dialog: The only future any of us have.
text: This draws a look back in the mirror from the Driver.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: But... he sacrificed his own daughter.
dialog: My sister, Samantha.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: The only true survivors of the viral
dialog: holocaust will be those immune to it:
dialog: those vaccinated against it and
dialog: human/alien hybrids. Your father
dialog: arranged for your sister's abduction.
dialog: He allowed her to be taken to an alien
dialog: hybrid program, so that she would
dialog: survive. As a clone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He had different hopes for you. That
dialog: you would uncover the truth about the
dialog: Project. That you would stop it. That
dialog: you would fight the future.
text: Mulder sits stunned by this. As if somehow his destiny
dialog: has been validated, if not pre-ordained. Or maybe just
dialog: justified.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Why are you telling me this?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: I thought it only fair you should
dialog: know, given how hard you've worked.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What happened to Kurtzweil?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: As your father knew, things need to be
dialog: sacrificed to the future.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Where is he?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
text: Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
text: Mulder stares at the W.M.M., at his cold-blooded
dialog: expression.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Let me out. Stop the car.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: (motioning)
dialog: Driver.
text: Mulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop.
text: Trying the door, but the door is locked. When he turns
text: back to the W.M.M. he has produced a handgun, which is
text: now pointing at Mulder. Laid casually across a folded
text: arm. Mulder reacts on seeing it.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: The men I work with will stop at
dialog: nothing to clear the way for what they
dialog: believe is their stake in the
dialog: inevitable future. I was ordered to
dialog: kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to
dialog: protect my grandchildren's lives.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I might just as easily kill you.
text: Mulder is recoiling as he says this. Then, without
text: hesitation in one quick move, he SHOOTS the Driver in
dialog: the head.
text: The blood spattering on the front windshield -- and on
text: Mulder who has barely had a chance to react.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Trust no one, Mr. Mulder.
text: Mulder looks at The Well-Manicured Man, expecting to be
text: next. And for a moment, we do too. But the W.M.M. simply
text: opens the door and steps out of the car. Holding the
text: door open for Mulder who is still frozen by the actions
dialog: that went just before.
scene_heading: EXT. DESOLATE D.C. STREET - NIGHT
text: Mulder steps out of the car, holding the felt envelope.
text: The Well-Manicured Man stands with a sober, intense
dialog: look.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: (with quiet force)
dialog: You have precious little time. What
dialog: I've given you the alien colonists
dialog: have no idea exists. You hold in your
dialog: hand the power to end the project.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: How?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: The vaccine you hold is the only
dialog: defense against the virus. Its
dialog: introduction into an alien environment
dialog: may have the power to destroy the
dialog: delicate plans we've so assiduously
dialog: protected for the last fifty years.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or it may not.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What alien environment?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her
dialog: science can save the future.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What about you?
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: My life is over.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Go.
text: Mulder stands speechless for a moment. Until the W.M.M.
text: points the weapon he's still holding at him.
scene_heading: WELL-MANICURED MAN
dialog: Go now!
text: And Mulder does. Moving away from the car, looking back
text: over his shoulder. As the Well-Manicured Man gets back
text: into the limousine, closes the door. A moment later...
text: THE CAR EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, knocking Mulder to the
dialog: ground.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MULDER
text: The felt envelope has been jarred from his grasp. Its
text: contents loosed from inside: a piece of paper with
text: COORDINATES on it and an AMPULE and SYRINGE.
text: Mulder gets up, looks back. Then he picks up the
text: envelope and its contents -- and begins to run. Running
text: as fast as he can go. Until, far down the block, he
dialog: disappears.
text: As the SCREEN DISSOLVES TO WHITENESS -- under which we
text: hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble. The
dialog: same sound that opened our story.
text: Then there is movement, as the curvilinear line of a
text: horizon becomes visible, bi-secting the screen between
dialog: the white of the earth and the white of the sky. We
dialog: are:
scene_heading: EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA
text: Across the expanse of whiteness, a DARK IMAGE appears on
text: the long flat horizon. Moving toward us. As a LEGEND
text: appears, to establish.
scene_heading: CLOSER ON A SNOW TRACTOR
text: Crawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed
dialog: insect.
scene_heading: INT. SNOW TRACTOR
text: Agent Mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed
text: cabin, several days growth on his face. Dressed in
text: thick, bundled outerwear. He maneuvers the vehicle to a
text: stop. Reaching for a handheld GPS monitor to check his
text: position. Catching his breath for a moment -- all
text: movement is exertion in this climate. Mulder stares hard
text: out the front window, the wipers beating time, but there
text: is nothing out there but whiteness. He wipes the fog
text: from a side window with his gloved hand, seeing nothing
text: but more whiteness. Checking the GPS device again, then
text: reaching for the door latch.
scene_heading: RESUME WIDE EXTERIOR
text: Agent Mulder exits the vehicle, hopping down onto the
text: snowscape crust. Setting out on foot with the GPS device
text: held before him. In this forbidding environment he might
dialog: as well be taking a space walk -- without the security
dialog: of a lifeline. Which is the impression we get as his
text: tiny figure trudges across the ice, increasing the
text: distance between himself and the snow tractor.
scene_heading: MOVING WITH MULDER
text: Up a gentle grade, the snow tractor now behind him.
text: Moving into tight f.g. where he stops, seeing something
text: now which allows him to pocket the GPS device. Dropping
text: instinctively to his knees, so as to avoid being seen
dialog: by:
speaker_heading: MULDER'S POV
text: In the distance is an ICE STATION. A row of
text: interconnecting WHITE DOME TENTS, whose design is now
text: familiar to us. There are what look like snow tractors
text: and other snow vehicles parked alongside the
dialog: structures.
speaker_heading: RESUME MULDER
text: Pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his
text: deep jacket pockets. Training them on:
scene_heading: THE ICE STATION - BINO MATTE
text: PANNING across the domes and vehicles, where there is no
text: sign of personnel -- until MULDER PANS off the building,
text: finding in his field glasses AN APPROACHING SNOW
text: TRACTOR. Moving across the landscape toward the ice
text: station. When it pulls to a stop, A MAN exits out of one
text: of the domes: THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. Moving to the
text: vehicle and getting in.
text: The vehicle reverses now, transporting the CSM back
text: away from the ice station.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MULDER
text: Taking the field glasses away from his eyes. The
text: excitement he feels expressed now in his breathing,
text: which has become harder and shallower. Mulder rises,
text: beginning to move the still great distance between
dialog: himself and the ice station.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: WIDE ON SCREEN
text: Mulder moving slowly across the white horizon toward the
text: domed tents.
text: LOW ANGLE ON MULDER'S FEET
text: Moving cautiously, and with effort on the snowscape
text: crust. CAMERA RISING up to Mulder's face, determined and
text: watchful.
scene_heading: FOLLOWING MULDER
text: The ice station still several hundred yards in the
text: distance, when MULDER SUDDENLY FALLS OUT OF FRAME,
text: disappearing into a hole in the snowscape crust that
text: just moments earlier had been stable footing.
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SNOW ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS
text: Where Mulder's body falls through a ceiling of snowscape
text: crust, landing on his back with a THUD on a hard
text: surface. It takes him a moment to catch his breath,
text: somewhat reminiscent of Stevie at the beginning of the
text: picture. Wincing through the pain. Until he turns over,
text: regaining his wits, and his bearings.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Mulder has fallen on a hard, narrow metallic structure.
text: Its dull black color a stark contrast to the white ice
text: it's encased in. The bubble has been created by air
text: coming out of vents in the structure, carving out
text: corresponding patterns in the ceiling; softening the ice
text: and snow above.
scene_heading: CLOSER ON MULDER
text: rising to his knees, the AIR from one of these vents
text: blowing onto his face. Pulling off the hood of his
text: jacket, looking deep into the vent which is open,
text: ungrated.
text: And big enough for a man to crawl into. Which, after
text: considering the hole he's fallen through high above him,
text: is really Mulder's only choice.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RIBBED CORRIDOR DUCT - CONTINUOUS
text: Mulder pulls himself forward through the ribbed corridor
text: duct with his elbows, moving lizard-like into the
text: constricted darkness.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Above a frozen ice lith, Mulder's head appears,
text: squeezing his shoulders and body out of a venting. With
text: effort, Mulder slides out of the small space, using some
text: architecture above as a handhold. Pulling his legs free
text: and dropping onto the floor.
speaker_heading: MULDER'S POV
text: It is dark in here, the features of the corridor
dialog: ill-defined.
scene_heading: RESUME MULDER - WIDER
text: Mulder pulls a flashlight from a pocket in his parka,
text: snicks it on. Its beam reflecting off tall frozen liths
text: of ice regularly spaced on both sides of the corridor.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE ON MULDER
text: Training the light down the corridor, which curves away
text: in both directions. Then pointing it at something right
text: in front of his nose: something that gives him a start.
text: Reaching up with his hand to brush away frost from the
text: lith. Finding A MAN FROZEN IN ICE. Naked, his eyes
text: staring into some long-forgotten distance. His hair is
text: dark, his flat features familiar to us. He is the
text: prehistoric hunter from the opening scenes of the movie.
text: His flesh has the opaque, see-through quality that we've
text: seen before. Inside of which, frozen along with the man,
text: is an EMBRYONIC CREATURE.
scene_heading: REVERSE ON MULDER
text: Reacting to this sight, then moving off down the
text: corridor, his pace quickened.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA
text: LOW ANGLE on the great white expanse. Across which a
text: snow tractor is moving. PANNING with the vehicle to...
text: Mulder's snow tractor, where the first tractor stops,
text: its headlights trained on Mulder's ride.
text: A beat, then the discovering machine moves out again,
text: following the tracks that Mulder has left, which brings
text: it STRAIGHT TOWARD CAMERA. As it passes us, we can see
text: the DRIVER and the Cigarette Smoking Man sitting in the
dialog: cabin. As we:
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: MULDER comes to the end of the dim ice corridor where
text: soft light is penetrating through several low, arched
dialog: openings.
text: Mulder has to drop down to his knees to see into the
dialog: openings.
text: ANGLE FROM OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BALCONY PASSAGEWAY
text: Where Mulder is seen looking TOWARD CAMERA. The Balcony
text: passageway is short. Mulder drops to his stomach again,
text: pulling himself through, toward us. When he reaches the
text: opposite end, Mulder pokes his head out, looking up in
dialog: wonder at:
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON
scene_heading: A STADIUM-SIZED DOME -- (CGI SET EXTENSION)
dialog: Imagine a domed sports arena -- this is the scope and
text: scale of the space that Mulder has penetrated. We see
text: him as only a small speck on a balcony midway between
text: floor and ceiling. Pulling himself out of the balcony
text: passageway, which is like countless other passageways.
text: Which are actually ventilation ports.
scene_heading: ANGLE OVER MULDER
text: Pulling himself to his feet. Beholding the space before
text: him. Looking down to the center floor where a large
text: central theater gives off a light different from
text: elsewhere in the dome. An icy, bright glow. Leading down
text: to the central theater far below are several LARGE
text: TUBULAR SPOKES. (One of which leads up right next to
dialog: Mulder's position.)
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MULDER
text: Reacting to this. Then something captures his
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: MULDER'S POV
text: There on the floor, far down below, is THE BUBBLE LITTER
text: Scully was transported in. (NOTE* Scully's clothes are
text: still in the bubble litter.) Standing out as a rather
text: human artifact against the otherwise dull gray bulwarks
text: and architecture surrounding it.
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL THEATER - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS - WIDE ON
speaker_heading: MULDER
text: looks beside him where the joint that connects two
text: sections of one of the long tube spokes is designed with
dialog: an allowance -- a separation that might allow a man to
text: slip through the joint into the tube. Which is what
dialog: Mulder does here.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TUBULAR SPOKE - CONTINUOUS
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE FROM INSIDE TUBE TERMINUS
text: Mulder squeezing through into the tube, looking down
text: past what looks like a chair lift-like track, on which
text: the chairs are actually empty cryopod mechanisms; the
text: same structures Mulder saw in the ribbed corridor in
text: which bodies were encased in ice. Except these cryopods
text: are empty.
text: Mulder begins to creep down TOWARD CAMERA, picking his
text: way around the empty cryopods.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE ON MULDER
text: Creeping away from us. Heading toward:
scene_heading: INT. LOWER CRYOPOD CORRIDOR
text: Where Mulder pops out at the lower tube terminus. Which
text: leads into this bulwarked corridor at the base of the
text: large stadium structure. Where:
scene_heading: REVERSE ON THIS CORRIDOR
text: Where Mulder is walking past frozen CRYOPODS hanging on
text: a track. Each icy pod containing a HUMAN BODY frozen
text: within. Partially visible behind clear blue ice. But
text: these are modern men, and women. Their expressions a
text: confused horror, as if they have been somehow frozen
text: alive. They are slowly tracking.
text: Walking along the slowly moving carousel of frozen
text: humanity. Stopping, turning, almost as if having
dialog: sensed:
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE OVER OPPOSITE CRYOPOD
text: PUSHING IN ON MULDER'S FACE. Recording the horror and
text: fear he's experiencing, on seeing:
text: CAMERA RISING UP A FROSTY WALL OF BLUE ICE
text: Where a woman's body is encased, its naked features
text: hidden behind the opacity of the newly frozen blue
text: crust. But whose face is unmistakable as that of Agent
text: Scully's. Frozen in a similar expression of far-away
text: horror, her eyes cast slightly heavenward.
speaker_heading: MULDER
text: hurries to get his jacket unzipped. Removing the FELT
text: ENVELOPE, removing the syringe body, the needle and the
speaker_heading: AMPULE.
text: Hastily putting the syringe together, getting the needle
text: poked into the soft rubber cap of the ampule. Bleeding
text: the syringe now, the substance inside squirting out of
text: the end of the needle onto the floor of the ship.
text: And the moment it does, the whole floor SIZZLES like
text: water being dropped onto a hot skillet. Spreading out
text: from Mulder in every direction. A VIOLENT CHEMICAL
text: REACTION, as predicted by the man who gave him this
text: substance. A moment later the entire structure Mulder is
text: in SHUNTS. Shuddering violently and setting up a low-end
text: RUMBLE. Causing Mulder to accidentally drop the
text: syringe.
speaker_heading: LOW CLOSE ANGLE
text: on the floor, where the syringe hits and bounces, but
text: does not break or leak. Mulder scrambling into frame to
text: re-collect it. Seeing the floor where the liquid from
text: the syringe hit -- where it has been ETCHED AWAY by the
dialog: substance.
scene_heading: EXT. HULL OF SPACESHIP/ICY BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS
text: Where Mulder crawled into the duct. Condensed air is
text: streaming out of all the ducts now. The ice and snow
text: above beginning to melt from the force and heat of the
text: blasting all.
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ICE STATION - CONTINUOUS
text: We can hear low end rumble and vibration. TWO DOZEN MEN
text: are streaming out of the dome tents. Moving to their
text: carious snow tractors and starting the vehicles.
text: A small exodus, the tractors pulling out of camp in a
text: rush. Heading off in various directions.
text: CAMERA FINDING THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN moving to his
text: tractor, with THE MAN WHO SHOT MULDER. Taking the last
text: drag of his cigarette before throwing it into the snow.
text: He stares down at it a moment, as if caught in the grip
text: of some emotion conflicting with duty.
text: The Man who shot Mulder inside the tractor now, throwing
text: open the door for the CSM.
dialog: MAN WHO SHOT MULDER
dialog: C'mon. It's all going to hell.
text: He climbs up onto the vehicle, gets in and closes the
text: door. And the vehicle pulls away as we:
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - AGENT MULDER
text: Back on his feet, SMASHING now at the crust of brittle
text: blue-ice that encases Scully. BASHING, SMASHING and then
text: finally breaking through the hard outer later, its inner
text: slushy contents spilling out of the puncture that
text: exposes Scully's face and shoulder. Watery aqua-tinted
text: liquid drains from her mouth and nose. But Scully is not
text: conscious, and there is no indication she is even alive,
text: her face frozen in a blank, almost beatific expression.
text: OVER MULDER TO SCULLY
text: As he plunges the needle into Scully's arm at the front
text: of her shoulder. To which there is an immediate reaction
text: -- as if given a shot of adrenalin. Her eyes blinking
text: away the cold moisture.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Scully --
text: Scully's lips move goldfish-like as she tries to suck in
text: air, an almost fearful expression overcoming her like a
text: swimmer who's been held under too long. But no words are
text: coming out yet.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Breathe -- can you breathe?!
dialog: Scully is straining to do just that -- when liquid
text: suddenly SPEWS from Scully's mouth. And she begins to
text: cough and gag -- taking big gulps of air as her eyes
text: focus on Mulder as if on a phantom, or a miracle.
text: Finally faint words ushering forth, whispering breaths
text: that Mulder cannot discern.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: What?
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MULDER AND SCULLY
text: As he leans into her, putting his ear up to her mouth.
text: As the softest sound comes out in Scully's frosty
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: Cold...
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Hang on. I'm going to get you out of
dialog: here.
text: As she continues to suck air.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HULL OF SPACESHIP/ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ICE STATION - CONTINUOUS - WIDE
text: As the ice tractors head away in all directions from the
text: domed structures. A misty fog now emanating from the

scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS
text: Filling with misty condensation, too. The small beams of

dialog: Illuminating:
scene_heading: THE PREHISTORIC MAN
text: Frozen in his icy pod, the hard semi-translucent surface
text: of which is now etched with small streams of water
text: running to the floor. Everything is melting and in
dialog: motion.
text: Including the CREATURE which is vaguely visible inside
text: the frozen man. It TURNS slightly inside the body, like
text: an animal in utero. Its eyes now looking at us,
text: blinking. As it presses against its own fleshy

scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: VARIOUS SHOTS

scene_heading: INT. LONG TUBE TERMINUS
text: NEW ANGLE ON MULDER AND SCULLY - LOOKING DOWN THE TUBE
text: Moving toward along the now-halted cryopod carrier

dialog: toward:
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BALCONY/CATWALK
text: Mulder pushing Scully up, though she seems to have at
dialog: least some limited ability to do this on her own. The

text: vibrating as Mulder boosts Scully up on the catwalk.
text: Climbing up over the prostrate body. Picking her up from
text: the floor, pulling her back into the fireman's carry.
scene_heading: INT. LOWER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Where the bodies are all beginning to melt.
text: VARIOUS SHOTS of rivulets of water forming on the

text: seeping onto the circular central floor. The condensing
text: mist thick and swirling.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON PODS
text: Where the body it houses seems to move. Though AS CAMERA
text: PUSHES IN we see that it is the creature inside this

text: bringing the embryos to life.
scene_heading: INT. UPPER RIBBED CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE DOWN
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Scully's head pokes through now, as she's pushed through
text: the opening that Mulder used earlier to get into the
text: vaulted arena. Pushed in fits and starts until she's all
text: the way through. Mulder now straining and squeezing to
dialog: do the same on his own.
text: The corridor is filled with heavy condensed mist now as
text: Mulder finally slips out of the low passageway, trying
text: to get his bearing now as he huddles low over Scully.
text: Turning his attention to her as she COUGHS HOARSELY --
text: in some kind of acute spasm of pain -- but alive.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: We've got to keep moving.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You got me. But I think I know what
dialog: they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
text: Scully is struggling now as Mulder tries to pull her to
text: her feet again. In real physical pain.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I can't...
text: Scully can't finish speaking, her voice becoming a

speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (barely a whisper)
dialog: I can't go any farther.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Yes you can. You're going to make it,

dialog: now.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE ON RIBBED CORRIDOR

text: into the corridor.
text: Mulder stopping and seeing:
text: THE BODY IN THE MELTING ICE LITH
text: As it too moves, the embryonic creature inside it
text: turning slightly, as if coming awake.
scene_heading: REVERSE ON MULDER
text: Reacting to this -- and then to Scully who suddenly

scene_heading: LOW ANGLE ON SCULLY
text: Her face is going red, straining for air. Her eyes
text: rolling, seeking relief. As Mulder drops down beside
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Shit --
text: But she is unable to answer. Mulder hastening to unzip
text: her/his jacket. To get to her neck and find a pulse.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Scully --
text: Mulder cannot find a pulse. Scully straining harder now
text: as Mulder reaches his fingers into her mouth, clearing
text: her passageway. Moving on top of her now, and pumping
text: forcefully on her chest -- trying to get air into her.
dialog: One - two - three.
text: And putting his mouth down to hers (FINALLY!), breathing
text: his life into her. Pulling away from her to see that he
text: is unsuccessful at this -- that Scully is continuing to
text: strain. Pumping her chest again --
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You're not dying on me now -- godammit
dialog: godammit godammit --
text: As he pumps her chest. Placing his mouth over hers again
scene_heading: and BREATH - BREATH -- BREATH.
text: Lifting his mouth from hers, feeling for a pulse again,
text: putting his eat down to her mouth, praying he'll feel
text: the breeze of a breath. Nothing. While:
text: ANGLE OVER HIM TO THE CREATURE IN THE ICY POD
text: As it moves again, MORE VIOLENTLY NOW. As the ice around
text: it continues to melt and fissure.
speaker_heading: RESUME MULDER
text: His hands going to a pocket on the inside of the jacket
text: Scully is wearing -- his jacket -- finding again the
text: syringe that he used on Scully. It is still partially
text: full of vaccine. Mulder finding this, getting ready to
dialog: use it when --
text: -- Scully's body suddenly comes back to life beneath
text: him. Labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm.
text: Mulder breaths relievedly for a moment, watching Scully
text: coughing, coming back to life. Her eyes trying to focus
text: on him, finding him. Seeing his labored relief. The
text: panic melting away.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (weakly, pained whisper)
dialog: Mulder...
text: She wants to tell him something. He leans down next to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (continued weak)
dialog: Had you big time.
text: Mulder has but a moment to savor this weary victory
text: though when he REACTS to something, that causes him to

scene_heading: MULDER'S POV DOWN RIBBED CORRIDOR
text: Through the condensed mist he can see CREATURES
text: BEGINNING TO HATCH, sprouting from the melted
text: ice-encased bodies they have gestated in. Their THREE
text: FINGERED HANDS beating at the soft ice. Their powerful
text: feet kicking at it, too.
speaker_heading: RESUME MULDER
text: Looking the other way down the corridor, seeing --
speaker_heading: MORE CREATURES
text: The slushy material that makes up the inner core
text: spilling out with them as the creatures KICK out of
dialog: their tombs.
speaker_heading: RESUME MULDER
text: Lifting Scully up with all his strength he has left in
text: him. He's got to get her overhead now, back up the
text: venting that he slipped down from. She is weak and of
dialog: little help.
text: Mulder gets her propped up on his strength so that he
text: can use the power of his legs to boost her toward the
text: opening. Which puts him face to face with THE EMBRYONIC
text: CREATURE. Its eye looking directly at him, blinking,
text: before it goes into another FITFUL SPASM inside its host
dialog: body.
scene_heading: ANGLE DOWN FROM VENT
text: Where Scully is boosted up TOWARD CAMERA. Her hands
text: reaching feebly for something to grab onto. Finding a

speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: Keep breathing, Scully.
text: She utters something guttural, unintelligible as the
text: next thrust up from Mulder gets her head and shoulders
text: into the opening of the vent.
speaker_heading: RESUME MULDER
text: Beneath her, pushing with all his might. His hands under

speaker_heading: RESUME SCULLY
text: Struggling with her arms and elbows, barely conscious,
text: but somehow able to manage herself forward.
speaker_heading: RESUME MULDER
text: Pushing Scully up the last little way. Then reaching up
text: to find a handhold for himself. Grabbing hold and
text: lifting himself as one of his feet kicks at the ice --
text: where the creature he was just face to face with BURSTS
text: from its icy pod. One hand, then the other shooting out
text: of the ice where they have broken through the host.
text: Ripping open the front of the body, including the man's
text: face. Making a slimy, gaping tear in what was formerly
dialog: flesh.
text: Its hands grabbing at Mulder as he thrashes to free
text: himself from it getting a grip.
text: As Mulder struggles to pull himself up, fighting off the
text: creature which he cannot see beneath him.
speaker_heading: RESUME CREATURE
text: As it emerges from the ice, still grasping and TEARING

scene_heading: ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE VENT - SCULLY
text: lies motionless in the ducting, her body forced forward

scene_heading: TIGHT ANGLE ON MULDER

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SNOW/ICE BUBBLE - CONTINUOUS

text: to the surface. The air is full of condensation,
text: swirling around them.
text: ANGLE FROM ABOVE - THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE ICE
text: Where, through the swirling steam we see Mulder push
text: Scully clear of the vent. Climbing free himself now.
text: When the surface they are upon SHUDDERS AND QUAKES. As
text: if it has come unloosed, destabilized.
text: And with this comes A MIGHTY FORCE OF STEAM from the
text: vent Mulder and Scully just crawled from. Blasting up
text: past them with terrible HISSING FORCE. Causing Mulder to

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. POLE OF INACCESSIBILITY - ANTARCTICA - WIDE

scene_heading: NEW ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY
text: Pulling her to the surface of the ice sheet where behind

dialog: Causing Mulder to realize:
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: (over the din)
dialog: We've got to run!
text: She is weak, but is able to find her footing. Dragged

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ANGLE FOLLOWING MULDER AND SCULLY
text: As Mulder struggles to pull Scully fast enough to

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXTREMELY HIGH AND WIDE
text: The Agents mere specks fleeing the circle of churning

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ANGLE LEADING MULDER AND SCULLY

text: is moving in on them.
text: And then suddenly -- MULDER AND SCULLY are gone!
text: The radial edge of the falling snow continuing only a

scene_heading: WIDE ON LEADING EDGE

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON SPACE SHIP
text: Where now we see the scope and shape of the ship, which

scene_heading: RESUME MULDER AND SCULLY
text: Scully face down on the ice. Mulder lifting his head
text: when THE HEAVY SHADOW of the ship comes over them.
text: Looking up from this position to see:
speaker_heading: THE SPACE SHIP

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE OVER MULDER AND SCULLY
text: Scully is still face down on the ice, as Mulder watches

text: still parked in the distance. Moving up and off.
text: The ship continues up into the Antarctic sky where it
text: rises toward the sky where it begins to get WHITEHOT.
text: Transforming itself into pure energy. It is visible for
text: several moments during transformation. Then it
text: disappears completely. As it does the RUMBLE, which
text: dopplers across the white, barren landscape. Then it is
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: MULDER
text: Watches this then lays his head down on Scully's back.
text: He is spent, at the brink of complete exhaustion. His
text: whole body heaving. But now starting to shiver, and to
dialog: lose consciousness.
text: Scully's body is motionless beneath him, for a moment we
dialog: might believe that this is the way it might end. Out
text: here on the ice with Mulder and Scully freezing to
text: death. A chill wind blows off the Antarctic plain, the
text: same LOW RUMBLE, the only taint of silence in vastness
dialog: of this literal end of the world.
text: Then Scully coughs -- the same hoarse cough. She's
text: alive. Struggling to consciousness. Her head lifting
text: slightly, TURNING TO CAMERA. Her eyes blink open and she
text: coughs again. Feeling Mulder's weight on top of her,
text: unaware of his condition or even where she is.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Mulder...
text: There is no answer. Scully struggling to pull herself
text: out from under the weight of his body. Rolling over so
text: that her face is opposite Mulder's now. Seeing that he
text: has lost consciousness. Finding the strength to roll him
text: over, so that she can cradle him and warm him.
text: HIGH WIDE ANGLE ON THIS SCENE
text: With the Snowcat a short distance away, Mulder and
text: Scully in each others arms. The way it should end.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK
dialog: Silence. Longer than we would like. Long enough to make
text: us nervous, then certain, then angry. Then...we FADE UP
text: a prelap of the sound of a CRACKLING FIRE.
scene_heading: FADING UP ON:
scene_heading: EXT. ACRES OF CORN - MAGIC HOUR
text: TRACKING LOW WITH MEN IN FATIGUES, moving along the
text: perimeter of the corn field as they set fire to the corn
text: stalks with small handheld butane burners. While other
text: Men in Fatigues are moving between the rows dousing the
text: furrows with accelerant.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DALLAS - NIGHT
text: The large room filled with the evidence and debris from
text: the bombing. It is dark. Until A FLASHLIGHT BEAM pricks
text: the blackness, moving toward us into f.g. Carried by the
text: man we now recognize as The Man Who Shot Mulder. He
text: moves with directness, purpose. Finding what he's
text: looking for amid the cataloged material, he finds on a
text: work bench. Next to the microscope Scully had used. It
text: is the BONE FRAGMENTS, held in an evidence container.
text: He pockets them and exits as quiet and directly as he
dialog: entered.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ACRES OF CORN - WIDE - CGI PLATE
text: The sky aglow with orange flames as the crops burn to
text: the ground. We hold on this shot, PRELAPPING the sound
dialog: of:
scene_heading: JANA CASSIDY'S VOICE
dialog: ... in light of the report I've got
dialog: before me; in light of the narrative
dialog: I'm now hearing...
scene_heading: INT. FBI OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL REVIEW - DAY
text: Jana Cassidy sits at the head of the desk, just as when
dialog: we first met her.
text: She is flanked by the other members of the review board,
text: including A.D. Skinner who sits at the end of the
dialog: table.
text: Cassidy flips through a file she's referred to before
text: she continues. Looking up with consternation as she
dialog: resumes.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: ... my official report is incomplete
dialog: pending these new facts I'm being
text: asked to reconcile. Agent Scully...
scene_heading: AGENT SCULLY
text: Sitting where she last sat, at the small table. The seat
text: next to her conspicuously empty. Her face bears the
text: signs of slight frostbite, somewhat healed. Her
text: expression is even, her attitude composed, but her eyes
text: are filled of dark, restrained defiance.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: ...while there is direct evidence now
dialog: that a federal agent may have been
dialog: involved in the bombing... the other
dialog: events you've laid down here seem too
dialog: incredible on their own, and quite
dialog: frankly implausible in their
dialog: connection.
text: PANNING THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS - curious, bemused like
text: Cassidy. Skinner shifts uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: What is it you find incredible?
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Well...where would you like me to
dialog: start? Antarctica is a long way from
dialog: Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very
dialog: well submit a report to the Attorney
dialog: General that alleges the links you've
dialog: made here. Bees and corn crops do not
dialog: quite fall under the rubric of
dialog: domestic terrorism.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: No, they don't.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Most of what I find in here is lacking
dialog: a coherent picture of an organization
dialog: with an attributable motive. I realize
dialog: you're very lucky to be alive Agent
dialog: Scully. The ordeal you've endured has
dialog: clearly affected you -- though the
dialog: holes in your account leave this panel
dialog: with little choice but to delete these
dialog: references from our final report to
dialog: the Justice Department. Until which
dialog: time hard evidence becomes available
dialog: that would give us cause to pursue
dialog: such an investigation.
text: Scully has her hand in her coat pocket now. Moving
text: around the table and approaching Cassidy. Removing
text: something which she puts on the desk in front of her. A
text: small vial.
speaker_heading: SCULLY
dialog: I don't believe the FBI currently has
dialog: an investigation unit qualified to
text: pursue the evidence in hand.
text: Cassidy picks up the vial, studying the contents of this
text: vial: the dead bee that stung Scully. Studying it as
text: Scully turns and moves to the door, without permission,
dialog: no further adieu.
scene_heading: ANGLE TO INCLUDE A.D. SKINNER
text: Watching Scully exit.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Skinner....?
text: CAMERA PIVOTING TO INCLUDE CASSIDY. Looking at him.
speaker_heading: CASSIDY
dialog: Please ask Agent Scully to come back
dialog: to this hearing. We're not quite
dialog: finished.
text: As Skinner rises, unsure of the intent behind this
dialog: directive, we:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
text: We are JUST ABOVE THE TREETOPS. The Capitol Dome is in
text: the far distance. CAMERA CRANING DOWN to find Mulder
text: sitting by himself on a park bench. We are WIDE. There
dialog: is no one else around.
text: Until the Cigarette Smoking Man appears. Walking through
text: the otherwise deserted park. Joining Mulder on the park
dialog: bench.
text: CLOSER ON MULDER, THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
text: They do not speak for several moments. A quite tension
text: as the CSM lights up a trademark smoke. Inhaling,
dialog: exhaling. Then:
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: Congratulations on your survival. Your
dialog: life is worthless now, I hope you know
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: And yours?
scene_heading: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN
dialog: (derisive)
dialog: You think you've stopped it. What I've
dialog: worked for fifty years to create. You
dialog: haven't stopped it. You can't stop
dialog: it.
dialog: (takes a drag)
dialog: You're just one man.
speaker_heading: MULDER
dialog: You're wrong.
speaker_heading: WIDE ANGLE
text: Mulder rises from the bench heading TOWARD CAMERA. The
text: CSM rising, watching him.
text: As Mulder continues toward us. ADJUST TO REVEAL Agent
text: Scully in the f.g. Mulder moving to her as the CSM
text: watches from the distance. Their eyes meet, an unspoken
text: restored bond exchanged in this moment. Before Mulder
text: takes Scully by the arm, leads her off. Leaving the CSM
text: standing alone in the distance. As we:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CORN FIELDS/WHITE DOMES - TUNISIA - DAY
text: TRACKING LOW WITH A PAIR OF FEET
text: The wearer of them sporting peasant sandals. We realize
text: shortly that while the feet are moving across sandy
dialog: ground, that the foliage in the near b.g. is corn. And
dialog: that the person we are tracking with is passing row
text: after row of stalks.
scene_heading: CAMERA RISING AS IT TRACKS
text: REVEALING A TUNISIAN MAN dressed in peasant clothes. He
text: is carrying a piece of paper. Moving with hasty purpose.
text: Stopping at the end of one of the long rows of corn
text: where CONRAD STRUGHOLD is coming toward him. Making his
text: way between rows of stalks. The Peasant waits patiently
text: as Strughold approaches, handing him the piece of
dialog: paper.
text: Strughold reads it, his otherwise steely countenance
text: reflecting a disturbance seen only in the slight
text: narrowing of his eyes.
text: He looks up at the Peasant and says something to him in
dialog: Tunisian Arabic. Said as command, which causes the
text: Peasant to nod dutifully and move off as he came.
text: Strughold stands for a moment, then crumples the paper
text: slightly and drops it. Moving off down the same corn row
text: in which he approached.
text: CAMERA DROPPING TO THE GROUND where we find the paper on
text: which we see a flat section that is not so crumpled we
scene_heading: cannot read the words: X-FILES RE-OPENED. STOP. PLEASE
scene_heading: ADVISE. STOP.
text: CAMERA RISING NOW. Rising up past the stalks. Where we
text: can still see Strughold walking. RISING UP AND UP to
text: reveal ACRES AND ACRES OF CORN. Many times more than we
text: had seen previously. Stretched out across the Tunisian
text: Desert, ending only where THREE WHITE DOMES stand on the
text: distant horizon.
dialog: Off this image we FADE OUT.
