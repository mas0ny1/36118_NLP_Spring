scene_heading: 1 GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The October sun slashes through the gray clouds, cuts across the
text: shadow towards the sea, along the coast where the new suburbs of the
dialog: city of Giancaldo have been built up.
dialog: 
text: Bright light streams through the windows, glancing off the white
text: walls in an almost blinding reflection. MARIA, a woman a little over
text: sixty, is trying to find somebody on the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: ...Salvatore, that's right,
dialog: Salvatore. Di Vita Salvatore
dialog: ...But, miss, what do you mean you
dialog: don't know him?!...I...Yes...
text: (She gives a nervous sigh.
dialog: She has dialed her way
dialog: through endless numbers
dialog: but still hasn't managed
dialog: to speak to Mr. Di
text: Vita. She finally heaves a
dialog: sigh of relief.)
dialog: ...That's right, good for you!
dialog: Oh!...yes...And I'm his
dialog: mother. I'm calling from Sicily. Been
dialog: trying all day...Ah, he's not
dialog: there...But would you be so kind as
dialog: to give me...?...Yes...
text: (She nods at another woman
dialog: around forty sitting
dialog: nearby: it is LIA, her
text: daughter, who jots down
dialog: the numbers her
dialog: mother dictates:)
dialog: ...Six, five, six, two, two, oh,
dialog: six...Thanks ever so
dialog: much...Goodbye. Goodbye.
dialog: 
text: She hangs up, takes the number LIA has jotted down, determined to have still
text: another try. LIA speaks to her as if she were a baby, to be more convincing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIA
dialog: Look, Ma...It's useless calling him.
dialog: He'll be terribly busy, God knows
dialog: where he is. Besides he might not
dialog: even remember. Do as I say, forget
dialog: it...He hasn't been here for thirty
dialog: years. You know how he is.
dialog: 
text: MARIA pauses to think it over. The decision she has to make is important. Then,
text: stubbornly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: He'll remember! He'll remember!
text: (She puts on her glasses
text: and starts dialing
dialog: the number.)
dialog: ...I'm positive. I know him better
dialog: than you do. If he were to find
dialog: out we hadn't told him, he'd be
dialog: angry. I know.
dialog: (She takes off her
dialog: glasses.)
dialog: ...Hello? Good morning. Could I
dialog: please speak to Mr. Salvatore Di
dialog: Vita. I'm his mother...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2 ROME. STREETS. EXT/INT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown.
text: Inside a high-powered car, a man around fifty is driving. It is
text: SALVATORE Dl VITA. Elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face
text: creased by deep wrinkles. His weary expression hides the determined,
dialog: sell-assured manner of the successful self-made man. He must be a
text: heavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his
dialog: cigarette.
dialog: 
text: He stops at a red light. He stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the
text: window, as a little Fiat Uno pulls up alongside. A rock tune plays full
text: blast on the radio. SALVATORE turns instinctively to have a look at the
text: man at the wheel a BOY with a brush cut standing straight in the latest
text: fashion. He studies the Boy's expression with almost exaggerated
text: attention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly. The GIRL sitting beside him,
text: lots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns SALVATORE'5 look,
text: provocatively. The BOY notices, turns to SALVATORE in a surly voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Hey! What the fuck you looking at!?
dialog: 
text: Green light. The Fiat Uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3 ROME. SALVATORE S APARTMENT. INT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished. There is no one waiting for
text: SALVATORE. Through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen
text: slumbering in the night. SALVATORE gets undressed on his way to the bedroom. He
text: moves quietly, as if to make no noise. He doesn't even turn on the light,
text: finishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window.
text: A rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Salvatore...But what time is it?
dialog: 
text: She turns on the bedside light. It is CLARA, a young woman around thirty.
text: SALVATORE climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a
dialog: whisper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: It's late, Clara. Sorry, but I wasn't
dialog: able to let you know I wouldn't be
dialog: corning...
text: (He fondles her, but he is
dialog: tired, feels like
dialog: sleeping.)
dialog: Go to sleep now. Sleep.
dialog: 
text: He turns over on the other side. CLARA shuts her eyes, is about to drop off,
dialog: but whispers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: Your mother phoned. She took me for
dialog: somebody else...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Surprised)
dialog: And what'd you tell her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: I played dumb, so as not to
dialog: disappoint her. We had a nice little
dialog: talk. She says you never go see her,
dialog: and when she wants to see you she has
dialog: to come to Rome...Is it true?
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE doesn't answer. God only knows how often he's heard that question
dialog: before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: She phoned just to say that?
dialog: 
text: She reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLARA
dialog: She said a certain Alfredo had died.
dialog: And the funeral's taking place
dialog: tomorrow afternoon...
dialog: (A strange look suddenly
text: comes into SALVATORE'S
dialog: eyes. The idea of going to
dialog: sleep has clearly left
dialog: him. It's a piece of news
dialog: he didn't expect. That's
text: taken him off-guard. CLARA
dialog: would like to carry on the
dialog: conversation, but
dialog: sleepiness makes
dialog: it almost impossible. An
dialog: she can manage is one last
dialog: question in a faint little
dialog: voice:)
dialog: Who is it? A relative of yours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: No. Sleep. Go to sleep.
dialog: 
text: She falls asleep in the dead silence of the night. SALVATORE is seized by a
text: sort of chill a deep, troubled feeling. He gazes through the window al the city,
text: with its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a
text: heavy curtain of rain. But he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the
text: dark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless
text: memories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he
text: thought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re-emerges, comes back to
text: life, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle-aged features of
text: his face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is
text: formed, an ancient, remote image...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4 GIANCALDO. CHURCH AND SACRISTY. INT. MORNING
dialog: 
text: An image from over forty years before. In the baroque church of
text: Giancaldo. SALVATORE is nine years old. Dressed as an altar boy, he
text: is kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands. The
text: congregation is also kneeling. The PRIEST is consecrating the Host.
text: Little SALVATORE has just got out of bed, is still half-asleep, yawns
text: and doesn't notice that the PRIEST is standing there with the Host in
text: the air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Pss! Pssst!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the
text: withering look of the PRIEST. He gets the message at once and
text: rings the bell. Now the PRIEST can carry on, lifts the chalice and
text: the bell is heard again.
dialog: 
dialog: Cut to:
dialog: 
text: The service is over. The PRIEST is in the sacristy removing his
text: vestments. And SALVATORE is also there, removing his altar-boy
dialog: tunic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: But how can I make you understand?
dialog: Without the bell I just can't go on!
dialog: Always half asleep, you are! What do
dialog: you do at night anyway? Eat instead
dialog: of sleep?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Father, at my house we don't even eat
dialog: at noon. That's why I'm always
dialog: sleepy. That's what the vet says.
dialog: 
text: The PRIEST has finished disrobing. He takes the bell
text: SALVATORE was holding during the service and turns to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: All right, Toto, get moving, I've got
dialog: things to do. Say hello to your
dialog: mother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Can I...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (Interrupting him)
dialog: And don't ask if you can come...
dialog: Because you can't!! Shoo, shoo, off
dialog: with you!!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE gives a shrug and leaves. The PRIEST goes down a
text: corridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door
text: leading to an outside courtyard. He cuts across it and disappears
text: into another door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 5 CINEMA PARADISO AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. MORNING
dialog: 
text: The PRIEST enters a movie house. Not very big 200 seats on the main
text: floor and another seventy in the balcony. Along the walls, posters of
text: films to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures. In one corner,
text: a statue of the Virgin Mary with flowers. The CLEANING LADY has
text: finished work and is leaving. Up in the balcony, over the last row of
text: seats, are the holes of the projection booth. The middle hole is
text: camouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the
text: lens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth.
text: there are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be
text: made out, appearing and disappearing...It is ALFREDO, the
text: projectionist. He is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough
text: peasant face. He has finished loading the projector and is checking the
text: carbons in the arc lamp. Then he removes the glass from one of the
text: holes and looks down into the theatre, at the PRIEST who waves his
dialog: hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: OK, Alfredo, you can start!!
dialog: 
text: He sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre.
text: Up in the booth, ALFREDO lights the arc lamp and sets the
text: projector going.
dialog: 
text: Down in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth
text: streams the glowing ray aimed al the screen. String music, sweet
text: and ominous, spreads through the theatre. On the screen appear
text: the credit titles of an American film of the 1940s. The PRIEST
text: screws up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on
text: the arm of his seat.
dialog: 
text: At the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves,
text: opens a crack and SALVATORE'S gaunt little face appears. He
text: has managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a
text: word, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen.
text: The credit titles have long come and gone. The story is at a
dialog: turning-point.
dialog: 
text: Up above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion,
text: ALFREDO watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the
text: PRIEST, who is now drumming the bell with his fingers. On the
text: screen, the male and female lead, two Hollywood stars, are in
text: close-up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic. SALVATORE,
text: carried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty
text: of the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he
text: is sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen.
dialog: 
text: The love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love-struck
text: couple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. Instinctively, the PRIEST
text: raises the bell into the air, as in some age-old ceremony, and gives it a loud
dialog: ring...
dialog: 
text: Up in the booth ALFREDO hears the bell; it's the signal he's been
text: waiting for. He takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that
text: purpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that
text: specific scene as it winds on to the reel. The projection
dialog: continues...
dialog: 
text: ...And also the kiss of the two actors. The PRIEST'S nervous look lingers on
text: those black-and-white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last
text: declaration of love before separating. SALVATORE is wide-eyed, he's probably
dialog: never seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the
text: attraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. The screen is now filled with
text: the figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white,
text: voluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. SALVATORE stares in open-mouthed
text: wonder. The PRIEST, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth.
text: From the sound of the bell to another sound...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6 GIANCALDO. MAIN SQUARE. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The tolling of the bell-tower rings out over the
text: square. It is noon. The vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people. A
text: noisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water.
text: Peddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries. People come and go in front of the
text: town hall. The working men's club is deserted. The entrance of the Cinema
text: Paradiso is shut. Hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been
text: seen on screen. Up above, the windows of the projection booth are open. The hum
text: of the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of 'THE END'.
text: Then dead silence. The showing is over.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 7. CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: Despite the speed, numerous white streaks spin around on the reel,
text: created by the slips of paper ALFREDO has inserted into the loops. He
text: is rewinding the film by hand on the film-winder. When he's not
text: talking, ALFREDO usually sings to himself. SALVATORE stands beside
text: him, taking in everything he does with those quick, thieving eyes of his
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Harshly, shouting)
dialog: You must not come here! How many
dialog: times do I have to tell you?
dialog: (And he slows down the
text: reels with his hand. The
dialog: slips of paper
text: are about to arrive.
dialog: Here's the first.)
dialog: If the film catches fire, runt that
dialog: you are, you'd go up in a
dialog: burst of flame...whoosh! And turn
dialog: into a piece of...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Overlapping him)
dialog: ...and turn into a piece of
dialog: charcoal!!
dialog: 
text: He's used to his terrorisms, pays no more attention. Not even his
text: grim look scares him. Anyway, ALFREDO catches the joke, starts to give him a
text: slap, but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Angrily)
dialog: Christ, that's a sassy little tongue
dialog: you've got! Watch out, or someday
dialog: I'll snip it off.
dialog: 
text: And he snips a piece of film, pastes the ends together and goes on turning the
text: handle. SALVATORE picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look. He sees
text: a series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Can I have it?
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO snatches it out of his hand, furiously, at the end of his string. He
dialog: shouts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: No!!! Are you deaf or something? I've
dialog: got to put this back in when we wind
dialog: up the film again! You're a real pain
dialog: in the neck!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE reaches into a basket full of strips of film. He takes out a handful:
dialog: all kisses that have been cut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Then why didn't you put these back
dialog: when you wound up the films again?
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO is caught out. He stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck
dialog: in and cuts the scene:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: 'Cause sometimes you can't find the
dialog: right place any more and so...well,
dialog: actually...they stay here.
dialog: (Finding an excuse)
dialog: Besides, there are more kisses than
dialog: you can count.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Excited)
dialog: So I can have these?
text: (ALFREDO explodes, flies
text: off the handle. He grabs
text: SALVATORE by the shoulders
dialog: and shakes him.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass
dialog: all the way to China and back, let's
dialog: make a deal. These strips here are
dialog: yours, I give them to you. However!
dialog: One you're not to stick your nose in
dialog: here any more. Two I'll keep them
dialog: for you, because you can't take them
dialog: home for God forbid and save our
dialog: souls, if they catch fire, all hell
dialog: will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now
dialog: scram!
dialog: 
text: He takes him and turns him towards the stairs. For him the matter is closed. He
text: returns to the film-winder. SALVATORE sneaks back and while ALFREDO's attention
text: is elsewhere, snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter,
text: stuffs them into his pocket and...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: What sort of deal is this? The strips
dialog: are mine! So why can't I come see
dialog: them?
dialog: 
text: And he stares at ALFREDO with a sly, saucy look. ALFREDO clutches his hand,
text: darts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass. He
dialog: shrieks:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Get out!! And don't show your face
dialog: here again!
dialog: 
text: And before the kick reaches its destination, SALVATORE has already dashed off
text: down the spiral staircase.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 8 GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: That was not the first theft of film strips. SALVATORE's hand reaches
text: into a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film. He takes out a
text: few frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp. Gazes at the
text: figures that remind him of the films seen at Cinema Paradiso, and in a
text: whisper mangles fragments of dialogue, the shooting of guns, the
dialog: musical climaxes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Bang! Bang! Bang! Shoot first, think
dialog: later! This is no job for weaklings!
dialog: Treacherous dog!
dialog: 
text: The house has no lights, is gloomy and cold. SALVATORE's
text: mother, MARIA, is leaning on the table in front of him. She is
text: young, around thirty, and her pretty face is haggard, marred by
text: all the sacrifices. She is sewing some clothes, is a seamstress. LIA,
text: his four-year-old sister, is sleeping on a cot in one corner. The
text: kerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on
text: the wall, figures of prairies, gunslingers, thugs. SALVATORE's
text: voice changes, turns even tougher.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Hey there, you lousy bastard, take
dialog: your hands off that gold, You black-
dialog: hearted pig, stay away from me, or
dialog: I'll smash your face in!
dialog: 'Ntantatah!!!...
dialog: (In the heap of movie
dialog: frames there are also
dialog: several photographs.
text: SALVATORE picks them up.
text: Family keepsakes. A man in
text: an army uniform. Then the
dialog: same man with a girl
text: beside him whose smiling
dialog: face can be recognized as
text: MARIA. SALVATORE takes a
text: closer look at the man's
text: face, then whispers to his
dialog: mother:)
dialog: Ma, if the war's over, how come
dialog: Daddy's never come back?
dialog: 
text: MARIA looks up at him with a sweet smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: He'll be back, he'll be back...
dialog: You'll see. One of these
dialog: days...
dialog: 
text: But there is not much conviction written on her face. She looks
text: back down at her sewing. SALVATORE goes on looking at the
dialog: photos.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I don't remember him any moreMa,
dialog: where's Russia?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: It takes years to get there. And
dialog: years to come back...Now go to bed,
dialog: Toto, it's late.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE puts the photos back into the box and tucks the box
text: under LIA's cot near the charcoal burner.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 9 GRADE SCHOOL. COURTYARD. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: A noisy crowd of little children in black smocks, white collars and blue
text: bows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm
text: trees. The boys head for one door, the girls towards the opposite one.
text: The Janitors line them up two by two, ready to enter. Here and there,
text: parents and relatives accompany the younger ones. Beneath one of the
text: palms, SALVATORE pulls off the altar-boy tunic, stuffs it into the
text: khaki-colored cardboard schoolbag, takes out the smock and puts it
text: on, as one of his schoolmates passes by. It is MASINO, and he's crying
text: desperately because he doesn't want to go to school. His FATHER drags
dialog: him along, yelling:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASINO'S FATHER
dialog: You can fool your mother but not me!
dialog: Get yourself a damn diploma and
dialog: become a policeman. You good-for-
dialog: nothing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASINO
dialog: I don't want to go to school'
text: (The sound of the bell.
text: The black lines move up
dialog: the steps towards the
dialog: school.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: 1O FOURTH GRADE. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is sitting at the front-row desk next to PEPPINO,
text: a little freckle-faced boy. His attention, like that of the whole class, is
text: concentrated on what is taking place at the blackboard. The TEACHER is standing
text: there, watching a plump little boy, shy and not quite all there, do a two-figure
text: multiplication it is NICOLA SCORSONE, known as 'COLA'. He is red in the face,
text: has one purple ear and one white one. He stares in terror at that '255 x 15'
text: written on the blackboard. The TEACHER yells, waving a birch rod in her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Well then?! Five times five
dialog: equals...?
dialog: 
text: COLA stops to think a moment, then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLA
dialog: Thirty!
dialog: 
text: The TEACHER grabs him by the purple ear and bashes his head against the numbers
text: on the blackboard. A large thud echoes through the room, followed by a roar of
text: laughter. The TEACHER slams her rod on the desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Silence!!
dialog: (Then to COLA)
dialog: The five times table. Dunce! One
dialog: times five, five!!
dialog: (The class repeats with
dialog: the TEACHER, in a sing-
dialog: song chorus:)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER and CLASS
dialog: Two times five, ten! Three times
dialog: five, fifteen! Four times five,
dialog: twenty!
text: (With a wave of the rod,
text: the TEACHER silences the
dialog: class, and finishes the
text: sing-song with the fateful
dialog: question.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Five times five?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLA
dialog: (Timidly)
dialog: Forty...?
dialog: 
text: Another blow of the head on the blackboard. Hubbub.
text: Slapping of the rod on the desk. SALVATORE secretly shows
text: COLA the picture of a Christmas tree on one page of the book,
text: and mouths the word 'twenty-five'. COLA smiles, he has finally
text: caught on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: I'm asking you for the last time,
dialog: blockhead! Five times five equals...?
text: (COLA turns to her with
dialog: smiling eyes and answers
dialog: blissfully:)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLA
dialog: Christmas!!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE clutches his head in anger, watches the TEACHER
text: flogging COLA on the back with the rod. COLA screams at every
text: blow, and at every blow the laughter in the class grows louder.
text: SALVATORE stares at the rod moving up and down rhythmically. But he is not
text: thinking of the pain his schoolmate is feeling, but is drawn, rather, by that
text: strange regular beat, finds it similar to another regular beat, that of...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 11 CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND MAIN FLOOR. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: ...the rolling pin ALFREDO uses to flatten out a reel of film that has just
text: been unloaded. SALVATORE carefully watches ALFREDO 5 every move. He is not in
text: the projection booth, but up in the balcony, standing on top of the last row of
text: seats. He peers through the hole next to the lion's head. His bright little eyes
text: fix in his mind the things ALFREDO does, as he loads the film into the
text: projector, shuts the fireproof housings, turns on the amplifier, checks the
text: carbons in the arc lamp, then lowers his head to have a look into the theatre
text: and finds himself face to face with SALVATORE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Sternly)
dialog: What are you doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I bought a ticket. I've come to see
dialog: the film.
dialog: (Meanwhile the USHER comes
text: up behind him and grabs
text: him by the collar, and he
text: almost jumps out of his
text: skin. ALFREDO laughs.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: USHER
dialog: (Yelling)
dialog: Go sit downstairs! You good-for-
dialog: nothing sponger! !
dialog: (To the audience)
dialog: Worse than rabbits they are!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE has run downstairs. The main floor is more
text: crowded than the balcony, like every Sunday, and there is a greatdin. The BOY
text: selling ice-cream, soda pop and candy shouts and
text: runs around like a chicken with its head off. Now the lights dim,
text: the hubbub dies down and the performance starts. Before the film
text: there is a preview for Stagecoach. The screen fills with images ofJohn Wayne,
text: the pursuit of the stagecoach by hostile Indians
dialog: etc...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is sitting in the front rows, right under the screen,
text: next to BOCCIA, COLA, MASINO, PEPPINO and OTHER KIDS, all with their noses in
text: the air. BOCCIA, the biggest show off of the group, is smoking a cigarette. An
text: OLD MAN appears through the entrance curtain, takes a couple of steps and
dialog: shouts:)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIRST OLD MAN
dialog: Hello, everybody!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: (At once)
dialog: Ssssssh!!! Ssssssh! Silence!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIRST OLD MAN
dialog: Can't I say hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: USHER
dialog: It's a double-feature today.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIRST OLD MAN
dialog: I couldn't care less. I come here to
dialog: sleep.
dialog: 
text: All at once, a chorus of shouts and whistles fills the theatre. Up
text: on the screen, a globe of the world appears, spinning among the
text: stars, the logo announcing the newsreel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: (Hooting and whistling)
dialog: For Christ's sake! Cut it,
dialog: Alfredoooo!
dialog: 
text: The CHILDREN in the front rows also yell, but SALVATORE goes
text: on being alert. He turns and looks up at the holes of the projection
text: booth, as if it were an impregnable fortress. He watches the crazy
text: dancing of light in the glowing stream that opens towards him in a
text: cone. And besides, that lion's head, mysterious, almost gruesome,
text: emphasizes the enigmatic secret of the movies. In his dreamy eyes,
text: that lifeless lion seems to wake up with a ferocious roar.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE has a frightened look...Another lion roaring. But up on the screen.
text: The MGM lion. The throng of children imitate the famous growl all together,
text: shaking their heads in unison.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHILDREN
dialog: Grrrr! Grrrrr!
dialog: 
text: The film starts: it is Visconti's La terra trema. SALVATORE is in bliss. His
text: wide eyes looking up at the magic square of light. The title music. Another OLD
text: MAN enters at the back of the theatre, but before sitting down, says hello in a
text: loud voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND OLD MAN
dialog: Greetings to one and all!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: SSSSSH' Drop dead! Silence! Hey,
dialog: kids, we're here to see the film!
dialog: 
text: Now there is an important sequence. The audience is silent. Concentrated on the
text: screen. BOCCIA passes the lighted cigarette to SALVATORE. He takes a puff and
text: hands it on to the others without ever taking his eyes off the screen. The
text: beautiful star of the film appears on screen. A different kind of attention
text: takes hold of the excited audience. SALVATORE and the others stare at her with
text: open mouths...She leans towards the leading man, a languid expression, their
text: profiles touch. But all at once, just at the best part, there is a sudden jolt.
dialog: 
text: The kiss isn't seen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: (Disappointed)
dialog: Ahhh! What a shame! I've been going
dialog: to the movies for twenty years and I
dialog: never saw a kiss!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is the only one to laugh to himself. He knows what has happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: And when will we see one?
dialog: 
text: Up in the balcony, the audience is more sedate. The tickets cost more and the
text: people are richer, more refined. Among them, a MAN with a moustache, the look of
text: a public notary, is sitting right in front of the railing. Seriously, without
text: batting an eye, he spits down below with contempt. Right on the dot, a voice is
text: heard, followed by a chorus of protests.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE and AUDIENCE
dialog: Bugger!!! Ssssh!!! Silence!!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12 SQUARE AND ENTRANCE OF CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The bell-tower rings midnight. The square is nearly deserted. Except
text: for a landowner near the refreshment stand, with a moustache and a
text: hat, DON VINCENZO by name, who is picking out from a group of
dialog: labourers the men he'll be needing in the country at dawn. He chooses,
text: points his finger, calls...
dialog: 
text: People come out of the movie house after the last showing.
text: The USHER locks the front door as ALFREDO climbs down from the
text: projection booth. Among the crowd there is only one kid, SALVATORE.
text: Tired, half-asleep. He's seen all the showings. He starts to walk away
text: when he catches sight of his mother standing on the opposite corner,
text: wrapped in an old coat. She's waiting for him, in a temper.
text: SALVATORE drops his eyes to the ground, mortified. He knows what's
text: coming. He goes over to her timidly, uncertain, gives her a questioning
dialog: look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I've been looking for you all day.
dialog: Did you buy the milk?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: No...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Then where's the money?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Somebody stole it.
dialog: 
text: MARIA gives him a slap. SALVATORE holds back the sobs, but
text: his eyes brim with tears. ALFREDO and the USHER are nearby,
dialog: have heard everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: What'd you do with the money? Go to
dialog: the movies?
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE nods his head and the sobs increase. MARIA, in
text: despair, flies off the handle, slaps him again, but looks as if she
text: doesn't really want to, as if deep down she forgives her son's
text: escapade. ALFREDO catches on, speaks up on behalf of
text: SALVATORE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Signora Maria, don't do that. He's
dialog: just a kid.
dialog: (To SALVATORE)
dialog: And why are you telling fibs?
speaker_heading: (To MARIA)
dialog: We let him in free. He must have lost
dialog: the money inside the movie
dialog: theatre...
text: (SALVATORE stares at him
text: in amazement, goes on
dialog: listening to him.)
dialog: How much did you have?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Fifty lire...
text: (MARIA wipes away his tears.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
speaker_heading: (To the USHER)
dialog: What you find tonight on the floor
dialog: between the seats?
dialog: (The USHER reaches into-
text: his pockets, pulls out
dialog: some odds and ends.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: USHER
text: A comb, two heel-savers, a box of
dialog: tobacco...
speaker_heading: (ALFREDO very skillfully
dialog: reaches out with fifty
dialog: lire he has taken
dialog: from his pocket. And like
dialog: a magician he draws the
dialog: money out of
dialog: the USHER'S hand.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: ...and fifty lire!
speaker_heading: (To MARIA)
dialog: See?
dialog: (He hands over the money
speaker_heading: under the USHER'S
dialog: astonished eyes.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Thanks, Uncle Alfredo. Thanks. Good-
dialog: night.
dialog: 
text: She walks away, dragging SALVATORE by the hand. ALFREDO
text: gives him a wink. SALVATORE smiles and winks back, but he's
text: not very good at it; he can't manage to shut only one eye.
text: Everybody leaves and the square empties, as the VILLAGE IDIOT
text: comes up to the group of labourers, beside DON VINCENZO,
text: motioning them all to get moving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IDIOT
dialog: It's midnight. I've got to shut down
dialog: the square! Go away.
dialog: The square's mine! The square's
dialog: mine!!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 13 CEMETERY ROAD AND VILLAGE ROAD. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE, dressed as an altar boy, walks alongside the PRIEST
text: who is wearing the ceremonial vestments. They are tired, have walked
text: a long way. Behind them a donkey pulls a wagon containing a little
text: white coffin and a bunch of flowers. Behind that a little procession the
text: parents and relatives of the dead child. The road is very wide, covered
text: with white earth. The spring sun is dazzling. The funeral procession
text: kicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy, like a
text: dream, rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea. The
text: procession now turns into the large gate of the cemetery. ALFREDO,
text: working in the fields, takes his hat off and watches the coffin as it passes by.
dialog: 
dialog: Cut to:
dialog: 
text: The funeral is over. The PRIEST and SALVATORE are walking back
text: to the village. ALFREDO appears out of the countryside on e bicycle
text: with a hoe and other farm tools in the basket. He comes pedaling up
text: beside them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Good morning, father. It's hard on
dialog: the feet, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (Breathless)
dialog: Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and
dialog: all the saints help you. But coming
dialog: back! The saints stand there watching
dialog: you, that's all! God's will be done.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is about to open his mouth, wants to say something
text: to ALFREDO, but he doesn't have time. ALFREDO pedals harder
text: and rides off.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is crestfallen. He looks et the PRIEST, then at the bicycle riding
text: away. His eyes light up an idea! He suddenly yells:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Ouch! Ouch! My foot! I can't walk!
dialog: 
text: He limps. Throws himself to the ground as if a snake had bitten him. The PRIEST
text: leans over in alarm. Up ahead in the distance, ALFREDO turns around to look.
dialog: 
dialog: Cut to:
dialog: 
text: There is a smile on SALVATORE'S face. He is riding on the crossbar of ALFREDO's
text: bicycle. On their way back lo the village.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Alfredo, did you know my father?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Of course I knew your father. He was
dialog: tall, thin, pleasant, and had a
dialog: moustache like mine. Always smiling.
dialog: He looked like Clark Gable.
dialog: 
text: There's something SALVATORE wants to talk about, but he doesn't know how to
text: start. He has a try with an innocent stratagem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Alfredo, now that I'm older, I'm not
dialog: saying I can start coming to the
dialog: projection booth, to the movie
dialog: house...But...maybe, why don't we
dialog: become friends?
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO knows exactly what the little rascal is up to, and answers in a
text: strange, theatrical tone, as if he were repeating something he knows by heart, a
text: remark taken from some old film.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: 'I choose my friends for their
dialog: looks, and my enemies for their
dialog: brains...'
dialog: (Laughs)
dialog: You're too smart to be my friend.
dialog: Besides, as I always tell my kids, be
dialog: careful to pick the right friends!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Surprised)
dialog: But you don't have any kids!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Spluttering)
dialog: All right, all right! When I've got
dialog: kids that's what I'm telling them!
dialog: (The outlying houses of
dialog: Giancaldo finally heave
dialog: into sight.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: 14 SALVATORE S HOUSE. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: LIA, SALVATORE'S kid sister, is crying outside the front door, terror
text: stricken. Her face is smeared with smoke and her little dress half
text: scorched and soaking wet. MARIA is distraught, damp with sweat, and
text: tries to console her, hugging her in her arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Stop crying...The fire is out...I'm
dialog: here...That'll do, that'll do...
speaker_heading: (ALFREDO and SALVATORE
text: come up behind them.
text: SALVATORE has barely leapt
dialog: off the bicycle when his
text: mother sails into him like
text: a fury, shrieking:)
dialog: Miserable boy! You're the ruin of me!
dialog: Your sister would have been burnt
dialog: alive if I hadn't been there! And all
dialog: your fault!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE darts off, chased by his mother, swift as a deer.
text: ALFREDO doesn't understand what has happened, leans over
text: LIA, who goes on bawling her eyes out, and sees on the ground, in
text: the middle of the water, a flowery box all charred and still
text: smoking, and all around scraps of film reduced to ashes and
text: several singed photographs, the photos of SALVATORE s father.
text: ALFREDO gets the message now, looks up at MARIA, who has
text: caught SALVATORE and is dragging him home, hitting and
text: slapping him all the way. SALVATORE covers his head with his
text: hands to stave off the blows. MARIA turns to ALFREDO, in a
text: stern, indignant voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: But aren't you ashamed of yourself,
text: Uncle Alfredo, playing with a little
dialog: boy at your age?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Cowed)
dialog: But...what's it got to do with
dialog: me?...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: And who gave him all those films?
dialog: Promise you won't give him any more
dialog: of this trash! Don't let him set foot
dialog: any more in the movie house. The
dialog: boy's crazy! Crazy! All he talks
dialog: about is movies and Alfredo' Alfredo
dialog: and movies!!
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO is crestfallen, didn't think that SALVATORE'S craziness, his morbid
dialog: passion for movies, could go this far.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: I give you my word, Donna Maria.
dialog: (MARIA now turns one last
dialog: time to her son.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: God's got to grant me one wish! Send
dialog: your father back home! And he'll see
dialog: you get what's coming to you!
dialog: (SALVATORE lowers his
text: hands, looks at her and
dialog: with the dreadful
dialog: sincerity of children:)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.
text: (An icy flash runs through
dialog: MARIA'S eyes.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: It's not true! No! It's not true!!!
dialog: I'll show you he's coming back!
dialog: 
text: And she beats him desperately, as if to enforce her stubborn hope, slap after
text: slap. This time ALFREDO doesn't step in, lets MARIA give vent
text: to her rage and fury, but SALVATORE'S cries make him feel guilty.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 15:SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: Another Sunday. A crowd of men has gathered in the square around the café where
text: there is a loudspeaker. They are listening to the running commentary of the
text: soccer games. They check their Sisal pools coupons. NICOLO CAROSIO'S VOICE
dialog: ...We're at the seventh minute of the second half. Turin is leading one to
text: zero. The goal was scored by...(The scene is seen from above, by ALFREDO who
text: peers out of the window of the projection booth. CAROSIO'S voice drowns out the
text: soundtrack of the film being shown. ALFREDO is bored. He goes over to the
text: projector, looks through the hole...It's the last sequence of the film. The
text: music swells to a climax as 'THE END' appears on the screen. Swift as ever,
text: ALFREDO turns on the lights in the theatre' stops the projector. Looks back
dialog: through the hole, to see...)
dialog: 
scene_heading: 16:CINEMA PARADISO. INT/EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: ...the house packed to the rafters. Voices and laughter of the children. Smoke,
text: ice-cream, soft drinks. The USHER has opened the emergency exits to let in air.
text: He fights off the gate-crashers who are trying to get in free. The sound of the
text: sports commentary fills the theatre. The village BLACKSMITH is sleeping in his
text: seat, his head thrown back and his mouth wide open. The KIDS blow up the empty
text: ice-cream sacks and pop them next to his ears. Bang! The BLACKSMITH wakes up
text: with a start, in a sea of laughter. He yells:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACKSMITH
dialog: Ah! I'll wring all your necks!! Or my
dialog: good name means nothing! !! Lousy
dialog: brats!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE doesn't laugh. He is sad. He turns and looks up at the projection
text: booth. He sees ALFREDO through the lion's mouth. ALFREDO also catches sight of
text: him. SALVATORE gives him a timid wave of the hand, as if asking if he can come
text: up a moment. The look on ALFREDO'S face is unmistakable, irrevocable: N0!
text: SALVATORE'S not surprised; after what happened it won't be easy to win him over.
dialog: Yet there must be some way. But what is it? As usual, SALVATORE is smart as the
text: devil when he's out to get something. Through the emergency exit he sees a woman
text: pass by with a packet in her hand. It is ALFREDO's WIFE, and the packet is his
text: supper. SALVATORE leaps to his feet and runs out to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Signora Anna!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 17 CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION ROOM AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO starts up the projector. It's time for the documentaries and
text: cartoons. SALVATORE peers in from the top of the stairs. He's scared of
text: ALFREDO'S reaction, but pricks up his courage and shows him the
text: packet. ALFREDO sees him, is about to pounce on him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (On the defensive)
dialog: Your wife told me to bring you this.
dialog: 
text: His expression betrays the 'put on'. ALFREDO sighs, realizes it's another one of
dialog: his little games.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Sternly)
dialog: Give it to me!...
dialog: 
text: He takes the packet, unwraps it and lifts the lid, shuts it again and puts the
text: container inside the lamp of the projector to keep it warm. SALVATORE hasn't
text: missed a single gesture, but speaks with his eyes
dialog: to the poor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I told my mother you weren't the one
dialog: who gave me the films. That it
dialog: wasn't your fault. But I thought you
dialog: said the film could catch fire just
dialog: to scare me. Now that I know, I won't
dialog: steal any more from you. That's all I
dialog: wanted to say. I'm going.
text: (He turns to leave but
text: ALFREDO takes him by the
dialog: shoulder and stops
dialog: him.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Toto, come here.
dialog: 
dialog: All things considered, there is something in that little boy, maybe his
dialog: feverish passion, that strikes him. He'll talk to him seriously, without
text: resorting to terrorism, try to convince him. He lowers the volume of the
text: monitor, sits down on the stool. SALVATORE raises his eyes from the floor and
text: looks at him at last...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Now listen to what I've got to say. I
dialog: took up this profession when I
dialog: was ten years old. In those days
dialog: there weren't these modern machines.
text: The films were silent. The projectors
dialog: were run by hand, like this, with a
dialog: crank. And you wound the crank all
dialog: day long. It was really rough going!
dialog: If you got tired and slowed down'
dialog: boom! Everything would go up in
dialog: flames!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Then why don't you want to teach it
dialog: to me too? Now that there's no more
dialog: cranking, and it's easier?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Firmly)
dialog: Because I don't want to, Toto! This
dialog: is not a job for you. It's like being
dialog: a slave. You're always alone. You see
dialog: the same film over and over again,
dialog: because you have nothing else to do.
dialog: And you start talking to Greta Garbo
dialog: and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work
dialog: on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter.
dialog: Only on Good Friday are you free. But
dialog: if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a
dialog: cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Then why don't you change jobs?
text: (ALFREDO sighs, irritated.
text: He reaches out to turn the
text: knob of the carbon rods.
text: He gazes at SALVATORE as
dialog: if he were a grown-up,
dialog: somebody who's making
dialog: things hard for him.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Because I'm an idiot. How many other
dialog: guys in town know how to be a
dialog: projectionist? None! Only a jerk like
dialog: me could do it. Besides I wasn't
dialog: lucky. When I was a kid there was the
dialog: war! When I grew up, another war! Now
dialog: it's all different. Times have
dialog: changed. And you want to be a dope
dialog: like me? Huh? Answer me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: No...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Good for you, Toto. Good for you...
dialog: I'm only saying this for your own
dialog: good...
text: (He gets up and, speaking
text: all the while, goes into a
dialog: closet with a bucket
dialog: in it, the toilet of the
text: booth. He turns his back
dialog: and pees. )
dialog: Cooped up in here you die of heat in
dialog: the summer and of cold in the winter.
dialog: You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and
dialog: earn practically nothing.
dialog: (SALVATORE listens to
dialog: him, but taking advantage
dialog: of the fact he can't be
text: seen, he turns the knob of
dialog: the carbon rods, just as
dialog: he had seen done a moment
dialog: before...)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (In a loud voice)
dialog: But don't you like anything about
dialog: what you do?
text: (SALVATORE gazes at the
dialog: photos on the wall:
dialog: Keaton, Garbo, Snow
speaker_heading: White. ALFREDO
dialog: smiles to himself. Sure,
dialog: there's something about
dialog: that damn job he likes:)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: With time...you get used to it.
dialog: Besides, when you hear from up here
dialog: that there's a full house and that
text: people are laughing, having fun...
dialog: Then you're happy too.
speaker_heading: (ALFREDO is lost in
dialog: thought, doesn't notice
dialog: that the documentaries
dialog: and cartoons have
text: finished. The screen is
dialog: blank. And down in the
dialog: theatre laughter is not
dialog: heard but an uproar of
dialog: whistling and
text: swearing. SALVATORE'S eyes
text: sparkle, he seizes the
dialog: opportunity.
text: He turns on the lights and
dialog: stops the projector, just
speaker_heading: as ALFREDO
dialog: would have done. At which
text: ALFREDO buttons up his
dialog: pants in a
text: hurry and rushes over
text: alarmed, but sees that
dialog: everything is in order.
text: SALVATORE looks at him all
text: smiles, as if he expected
dialog: a medal for
dialog: civil bravery. Instead,
text: ALFREDO reacts like a wild
dialog: animal.)
dialog: So I've been wasting my breath? You
dialog: pretend to agree with
dialog: me, but as soon as my back is turned,
dialog: you do what you want!
text: (He gives SALVATORE a kick
dialog: in the ass, shrieking:)
dialog: Get out of here! I don't want to lay
dialog: eyes on you again! This is
dialog: the last straw! Your mother's right,
dialog: you're crazy!!
text: (He pushes him towards the
text: stairs. SALVATORE suddenly
text: vanishes, scared out of
text: his wits. ALFREDO talks to
dialog: himself, in a
dialog: fury:)
dialog: But how'd he do it? The little
dialog: bastard! By watching, he's
dialog: learned! It's incredible!
dialog: (He peers out of the
text: window, yelling, as he
dialog: sees SALVATORE
dialog: running through the
dialog: square. )
dialog: I'm letting the box office know
dialog: you're not to set foot even into
dialog: the theatre! There are no more
dialog: tickets for you! And I'm also
dialog: talking to Father Adelfio! You won't
dialog: be an altar boy any more
dialog: either!!! You little runt!
text: (SALVATORE looks at him.
text: Hates him. Yells something
dialog: offensive:)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!!
dialog: (But his words are drowned

dialog: of the people outside the
dialog: café.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Goal!! Holy Mother of God!!!
dialog: (A MAN in the crowd
text: crumples to the ground.
text: The others swarm around
text: him, alarmed. They hold up
text: his head. His face is
dialog: pale. They check the
text: coupon he is clutching in

scene_heading: 19 SQUARE AND VILLAGE. EXT. MORNING
dialog: 
text: Summer has come. The village has a different look. The peddlers sing their
text: monotonous refrains in the village streets. In one street, women are busy
text: canning tomatoes. In one corner of the square, the SHEARER has finished clipping
text: the donkey and is now shaving the hair of a row of bare-chested URCHINS with
text: nothing on but their underwear. Then another MAN disinfects them by spraying
text: them with the hand pumps used to spray trees in the country. The URCHINS

scene_heading: 20 GRADE SCHOOL DINING HALL. INT. MORNING
dialog: 
text: The fifth-grade exams. In the vast dining hall all the children are seated, one
text: for each desk, under the watchful eyes of the teachers. SALVATORE, BOCCIA,
text: PEPPINO, MASINO and COLA have taken places here and there, as nervous as

dialog: arithmetic problem.

scene_heading: EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER

dialog: Excuse me, professor. Here are the

dialog: (Turning to the door)
dialog: Come in, please...
dialog: (All the children turn to
dialog: look. A MAN around thirty
text: enters, ill at ease. The
dialog: children recognize him and
text: laugh mischievously. The
dialog: second is the BLACKSMITH,
dialog: the one who falls asleep
text: at the movies. The third
dialog: is a twenty-year-old-boy,
speaker_heading: ANGELO. The fourth is
text: ALFREDO, embarrassed and

text: TEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL moue about, checking to be sure there are no notes
text: being handed around or other forms of 'collaboration'. The four outsiders are
text: having a hard time. It can be seen on their faces. ALFREDO is also in trouble,
dialog: doesn't know how to solve the problem, the calculations are too diff cult. He
text: looks at the desk next to him, where SALVATORE is sitting. SALVATORE is about to
text: look up at him, but ALFREDO immediately looks away, too proud to let himself be
dialog: seen.
dialog: 
text: The exchange of glances continues, grotesque, almost comical. SALVATORE
text: meanwhile writes down numbers and operations quite quickly. ALFREDO can't stand
text: it any longer, is nervous, beaded with sweat. He's sorry he ever showed up.
text: SALVATORE laughs up his sleeve, now he has the upper hand. ALFREDO tries
text: sneaking a look at his exercise book in order to copy something. But SALVATORE
text: turns his back, hiding it from sight. ALFREDO tries sneaking a look at somebody
text: else's exercise book, but the damn kid also covers it. It looks like a
text: conspiracy against him. ALFREDO has no way out. He has to accept the idea of
text: eating humble pie. He looks at SALVATORE, motions him with his eyes in a
text: conversation of glances. He asks for help, but SALVATORE stands firm,
dialog: implacable.
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO tries to put it into words in a low voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: YOU jerk. Tell me how to solve this
dialog: fucking problem!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Ssssh! Silence back there!!
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO insists with his eyes. SALVATORE makes him understand with gestures
text: that he could help him maybe, but...on one condition. He imitates the gesture
text: of winding the crank of the projector. ALFREDO gets the message. It's pure
text: blackmail. He rubs his hand over his sweating face, raises his eyes to the
text: ceiling as if he were swearing. Then he surrenders, accepts the condition.
text: SALVATORE is serious, does not flaunt his victory, but you can tell he is happy.
text: He takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared, with the solution to the
text: problem, rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the TEACHER passes by,
text: takes aim and flicks it to him. ALFREDO'S hand catches the precious and dearly
text: bought message in mid-air. Their quarrel is over.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2I VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT. DAY/EVENING
dialog: 
text: A bright, lilting tune marks the rhythm of the quick, blurred images, as
text: in a dance, the images of ALFREDO teaching SALVATORE all the
dialog: secrets of the projectionist trade.
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO slips the reel on to the projector, unrolls the trailer and hands
text: it to SALVATORE. SALVATORE mounts the film on the sprockets.
text: Now SALVATORE sets the projector into motion, opens the shutter and
text: stands on tip-toe to see the screen from the hole...
dialog: 
text: A shot from In nome della legge. The main-floor audience applauds a
text: line spoken by Massimo Gironi. And from the balcony, the same little
text: MAN with the face of a public notary spits below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAIN FLOOR VOICE
dialog: Bastard!! Pencil-pusher!!
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO shows SALVATORE the running of the film. He points
text: to a place on the projector.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Pay attention. This is where it can
dialog: easily catch fire. If it
dialog: happens, the first thing you've got
dialog: to do is break it off, here
dialog: and here, so the whole reel doesn't
dialog: go up in fames.
dialog: 
text: On the screen, a shot from Riso amaro. A kiss. Unrelenting, the PRIEST rings his
text: bell. SALVATORE licks the film on one side, then on the other. He laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: You understand which side the
dialog: gelatin's on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: It tastes wonderful!
dialog: 
text: A shot of Amedeo Nazzari in La figlia del capitano. A jump,
text: an out-of-rack frame. The audience whistles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: Fraaaame!! Wake up, Alfredo!
dialog: (SALVATORE tries to do a
scene_heading: hand-binding. ALFREDO
text: winds the film, hangs a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: These are the shipping invoices for
dialog: the film. They are always to be kept.
dialog: You see?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: OK, Alfredo.
dialog: 
text: Down on the main floor, a scene from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
text: Everyone screams and hides their faces when Hyde looks at the
dialog: camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: Holy Mother! What a face! So ugly!
dialog: 
text: One young man, ANGELO, doesn't hide his face. He looks up at
text: a young woman, ROSA, in the balcony, who turns and smiles at
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO gives SALVATORE a wooden stool. He's had it made especially for him, so
text: he can be high enough to reach the reels of the projector and the arc lamp.
text: SALVATORE climbs up on it. He laughs, all excited.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Now you can run it by yourself.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE gives another smile. He is posing in a photographer's studio . He is
text: all dressed up for first communion, holding a white lily. The flash goes off
text: like lightning during a storm. Now SALVATORE is posing next to his mother and
text: little sister. They smile without hugging. Another flash of light. Click!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 22 FIFTH GRADE. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: Another click. The transparency of Rita Hayworth in her black gown
text: from Gilda. MASINO is pasting it inside a minute pair of plastic field
text: glasses. Other pupils crowd around him in excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASINO
dialog: (In a whisper)
dialog: Christ, what a piece of ass!!!
dialog: 
text: But there is not a cheerful atmosphere in the class - on the
text: contrary, a strange silence. The pupils are all standing around the
text: teacher's desk, having received their end-of-the-year report cards.
text: PEPPINO, who shared SALVATORE s desk, is saying goodbye to
text: his schoolmates. BOCCIA, COLA, the others. They have serious,
text: sad expressions. He and SALVATORE kiss like grown-ups. The
text: TEACHER is standing among them. One of the schoolmates does
text: not respond lo PEPPINO's goodbye gesture. He takes a few steps
text: back, serious, scared, his eyes lowered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Di Francesco, aren't you saying
dialog: goodbye to your schoolmate?
speaker_heading: (DI FRANCESCO gives his

dialog: But why?
speaker_heading: (DI FRANCESCO whispers,
text: almost into her ear.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DI FRANCESCO
dialog: My father says he's a Communist...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 23 SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: Another farewell scene in the square. PEPPINO to his grandparents. His father
text: and mother are also there, saying goodbye to the old folks. There are tears. The
text: cardboard suitcases tied with string are loaded on to the luggage rack of the
text: black car. The scene is watched by SALVATORE and ALFREDO, up in the window of
text: the projection booth. They look like old friends. On the sound monitor, the
text: strains of some American musical comedy tune.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Will they really find work in
dialog: Germany?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Who knows?...It's like an adventure.
dialog: (In a theatrical voice)
dialog: Hope springs eternal...
speaker_heading: (PEPPINO from the distance
dialog: gives one last wave at the
dialog: window of the
dialog: projection booth.
text: SALVATORE waves back.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!
text: (The black car drives off,
text: leaving a cloud of dust
dialog: that envelops the
dialog: suppressed sobs of the
dialog: grandparents standing
dialog: there waving
scene_heading: handkerchiefs. SALVATORE
text: watches the car drive off.
dialog: He mumbles:)
dialog: Good thing Germany's closer than

dialog: 
text: ALFREDO rubs his hand through his hair.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 24 CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND BOOTH. INT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The lion's head with the beam of light, seen from the balcony.
text: SALVATORE'S face appears in the hole beside it, as he peers down at the
text: images of the Settimana Incom newsreel.
text: The audience is distracted. The snoring of a man sleeping can be heard.
text: A pair of urchins pick up a cockroach with their hands, tip-toe down the
text: aisle. The sleeping man is the same old BLACKSMITH, with his head
text: thrown back. A little hand drops the cockroach into the gaping mouth.
text: The URCHINS take to their heels. The BLACKSMITH squirms, wake up
text: with a start. Spits, while everybody laughs. The newsreel is now about
dialog: missing soldiers in Russia.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR
dialog: The Defense Minister has announced a
dialog: new listof names of Italian soldiers,
dialog: so far considered missing and now
text: confirmed as dead. Families concerned
dialog: will be notified directly by military
dialog: authorities.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE pays careful attention, sees the black-and-white
text: shots of the last war. The Russian campaign. The troops in the
text: snow. Now in detail a heap of personal objects found on the
text: corpses. Documents, clothing, glasses, photographs. One quick
text: detail catches SALVATORE's eye among those photographs, for one
text: instant he sees one he thinks he recognizes. He quickly sticks a slip of paper
text: into the take-up reel, as when marking the kisses to be cut.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 25 PREFECTURE. CITY. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The hands of an OFFICIAL tear off several forms and give them to
text: MARIA who is sitting in front of the desk. She is dressed in black.
text: SALVATORE stands beside her, holding her hand. They have black
text: bands on their arms. An empty stare in their eyes.
text: MARIA is pale, a cold look in her sunken eyes. Her heart is bursting in
text: her breast. And a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking. She
text: looks at her husband's belongings, identifies them a gold chain, an ID
text: card and the photograph, the one SALVATORE saw in the newsreel.
text: MARIA strokes it with her fingers. SALVATORE comes up and looks, as
dialog: the OFFICIAL concludes:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: ...Unfortunately we don't know what
dialog: war cemetery he's buried in...This
dialog: is the form for the pension. If you'd
dialog: like to sign it...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 26 PREFECTURE AND CITY STREET. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: MARIA walks through the city. She holds SALVATORE by the hand. SALVATORE looks
text: up, trying to catch her eye. He sees her crying, in silence. The heartbroken
text: tears of someone who has lost the one last hope, but held back, so as not to be
text: seen by the child. SALVATORE presses close and puts his arm around her waist.
text: They turn the corner, and walk off in the noisy city, disfigured by the ruins of
text: war. A poster for Gone with the Wind catches SALVATORE's eye. He smiles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 27 CINEMA PARADISO. BOX OFFICE. PROJECTION BOOTH. SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: Winter has returned. On the screen, a sequence from I pompieri di Viggiu. The
text: theatre is jam full. The sea of heads sways and shakes at the irresistible jokes
dialog: of Toto.
dialog: 
text: Some people have climbed up on the window-sills. The aisles are crammed, an the
text: way down to the screen, where grown-ups and children sit on the floor, their
text: noses in the air. Some people munch crusts of bread they've brought along from
text: home. Almost everybody is smoking. A woman laughs, holding the baby she is
text: nursing. In one corner, at the end of one of the aisles jammed with people
text: standing, a girl laughs, but every now and then her expression reveals a look of
dialog: deep pleasure.
dialog: 
text: Her body moves slightly. Clinging to her from the rear is a man bathed in sweat.
dialog: 
text: They are making love standing there among the crowd, which notices nothing and
text: goes on laughing.
dialog: 
text: In the balcony ANGELO is holding hands with ROSA.
text: The curtain over the entrance is open. People are also standing there,
text: seeing what they can from the distance, even a corner of the screen
text: through the forest of heads. But the line continues on outside...All the
text: way to the entrance of the movie house, out in the square. There are
text: crowds of people, shivering from the cold, who protest, shove, risk
text: provoking incidents. The PRIEST, Father Adelfio, is exhausted, tries to
dialog: calm them down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Don't shove! There's no room! For
dialog: heaven's sake! I can't

speaker_heading: VOICES IN CROWD
dialog: Father Adelfio, we've been here for

dialog: Ouch!! My foot!!!
dialog: 
text: It has just stopped raining, the bell-tower rings eleven o'clock. On
text: the poster of the film a ' LAST DAY' sticker. The PRIEST, the
text: TICKET-SELLER, the USHER and TWO CARABINIERES push the crowd back, close the
text: front door. The protest grows louder. Fists pound the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Open up!!! Father Adelfio!!
dialog: (The audience in the
text: theatre hears the uproar.
dialog: Reacts:)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: Ssssh! Sssssh! Be quiet out there!!
dialog: What the hell!
dialog: (From the window of the
speaker_heading: projection booth, ALFREDO
dialog: and SALVATORE look at the

dialog: and complaining. Some of
text: the people look up at
dialog: them. )
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICES IN CROWD

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Why can't we show the same film
dialog: tomorrow?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: It's got to be sent to another town.
dialog: And if we don't the owner of that
text: movie house gets pissed off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Too bad!
dialog: 
text: The crowd sways nervously. The CARABINIERES give order.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARABINIERES
dialog: (Exasperated)
dialog: Stop! Go home, all of you! Otherwise
dialog: somebody's going to end up in jail!'
dialog: That's enough!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Dramatically)
dialog: 'Joe! A mob doesn't think, doesn't
dialog: know what it's doing...'
dialog: (SALVATORE gives him a
text: curious, inquisitive look.
text: ALFREDO smiles.)
dialog: Spencer Tracy said it in Fury.
dialog: (Mischievously)
dialog: What'd you say if we let these poor
dialog: devils see the film, Toto?
text: (SALVATORE stares at him
dialog: in amazement, all
dialog: excited.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Wonderful! But how can it be done?
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO turns away from the window. He gives a smirk, imitates the tough
dialog: American movie stars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: You don't believe my words, but
dialog: you'll have to believe your own
dialog: eyes!...And now get your ass off
dialog: that damn stool, boy!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE laughs, eagerly, as if he were about to see a whole new movie. He
text: climbs off the stool. Both of them move towards the projector...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 28 PROJECTION BOOTH AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: Trying not to put his hand in front of the lens, ALFREDO removes the
text: frame with the glass that protects the projection. He wheels it around
text: and motions SALVATORE to look...On the wall behind the projector:
text: the film picture appears gradually, reflected by the glass, moves as the
text: glass moves all the way over to the window looking out over the square.
text: There it disappears. SALVATORE can barely believe his eyes, as if it
text: were a piece of magic. He takes a quick look through the hole to see if
text: the film is still showing on the screen. It is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Mysteriously)
dialog: Go to the window, boy, and have a
dialog: look...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE goes over to the window. Looks out. The reflected
text: beam of light ends up on the white row of houses facing the
text: square. It's like another screen. Except the images are
dialog: backwards, like when you look in a mirror. And here and there
dialog: are the windows of the houses...For SALVATORE, it's a
text: wonderful spectacle, like a dream, ravishing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Alfredo, it's beautiful.
text: (A voice is heard in the
dialog: crowd of people jammed
text: around the entrance to the
dialog: movie house.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE IN CROWD
dialog: (Shouting)
dialog: Hey, look there!! The movie!!
dialog: (All heeds turn to look at

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Oh, praise the Lord!! It's true!
dialog: Look! The movie!! There's Toto!!
dialog: Hurry! Hurry!...THANKS, ALFRED0000!!
dialog: 
text: And everybody runs over to the other side of the square, in front
text: of the strange new screen. ALFREDO and SALVATORE watch with glittering eyes.
text: SALVATORE lays his hand on the shoulder of his great pal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Good for you, Alfredo!
dialog: 
text: A close-up of Toto projected on the houses, and one of the windows opens. A MAN
text: appears, in his pajamas. Dazzled by the light, he shades his eyes with his hand.
text: He sees all those people looking at him and laughing together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Shut the window!! Shut the window! Go
dialog: to bed!!
dialog: 
text: The MAN is dazed. Doesn't now what's going on. Looks around, and sees the
text: black-and-white figures of the film dancing around him. He pops back inside,
text: slams the window shut, almost cared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICES IN CROWD
speaker_heading: (To ALFREDO)
dialog: Sound!!! Sound!! Alfredooooo!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: What do you say, should we make them
dialog: happy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Sure, sure!
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO takes the loudspeaker of the monitor, rings it over to the window,
text: turns it around towards the square. He turns up he volume and the sound-track
text: fills the square. A chorus of approval.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Aaaaaaaa! At last!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Looking at SALVATORE)
dialog: Do you want to go down there?
dialog: (SALVATORE gives a
dialog: contented nod.)
dialog: Go on.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE runs on. ALFREDO looks wistfully towards the huge image in the
text: square. Down in the square SALVATORE heads for the crowd, his eyes trained on
text: the house-front screen. Behind him, the door of the movie house opens. The
text: PRIEST, Father Adelfio, sees the film being projected on the house front,
text: the people standing or sitting on the ground, laughing. His eyes nearly pop out
text: of his head. Then he motions over the TICKET-SELLER, whispers something into his
text: ear. The TICKET-SELLER strides over to the shivering spectators, pulls the pad
text: of tickets out of his pocket.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TICKET-SELLER
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen! You have to buy
dialog: tickets! Reduced rate!
dialog: 
text: An irresistible chorus of Bronx cheers washes over him. SALVATORE looks around,
text: highly amused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Fuck off!! The square belongs to
dialog: everybody!
speaker_heading: (The VILLAGE IDIOT peers
dialog: Out Of the crowd, all
dialog: worked up.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VILLAGE IDIOT
dialog: No!!! The square's mine!!! Come on,
dialog: kids, no joking around here!!!
dialog: Otherwise...
dialog: 
text: The crowd roars with laughter. SALVATORE laughs too, as if carried away by it
text: all. And over the general merriment looms the shadow of ALFREDO, standing in the
text: window of the projection booth. All at once, on the house-front screen, the
text: image of Toto slows down for an instant, a white blister appears and spreads
text: until it fills the whole screen. The crowd gives a start of bewilderment and
text: fear. SALVATORE jerks his head around to look at the booth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 29 PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The film bursts violently into flame among the gears and sprockets of the
text: projector. ALFREDO is taken off-guard. He breaks the film running into the take-
text: up reel, but is unable to do it for the delivery reel. He grabs the film which
text: is catching fire and pulls it out quickly, tries to stop the flames from
text: reaching the reel in the f reproof housing. A desperate race against the speed
text: of the fire. The flames on the floor burn his legs. ALFREDO gives a jump, slows
text: down the movement of his hands for an instant and inevitably the flames run
text: ahead, reach the upper housing. It's like an explosion. The flames leap out,
text: striking him full in the face. ALFREDO doesn't have time to scream, struggles
text: desperately and falls to the floor. Meanwhile the flames envelop everything.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 30 SQUARE.EXT.EVENING
dialog: 
text: The flash of the flames flares up in the windows of the projection booth.
text: SALVATORE is appalled, elbows his way through the moving
text: crowd. Inside the movie house the murmuring of the audience can be heard,
text: growing louder and louder. A scream...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3I:CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: A violent spurt of flames leaps out of the mouth of the plaster lion's head,
text: into the darkness broken by the screams of people rushing for the exits.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 32 SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO ENTRANCE. EXT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The crowd streaks out of the movie house, enveloped in a cloud of black smoke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Heeeelp! Run for your lives!!!
dialog: 
text: In the general panic, SALVATORE tries in vain to get inside, elbows his way
text: towards the street with the stairs leading to the projection booth. The audience
text: clashes against him, knocks him to the ground, almost trampling him underfoot.
text: He is suddenly seized by a superhuman force; gets up, claws his way desperately
text: ahead, with people falling on top of him and to the floor. He finally succeeds,
text: starts up the stairs...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 33 CINEMA PARADISO. STAIRS AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The place is filled with smoke. The air is suffocating. SALVATORE streaks up the
text: stairs, gasping for breath. The projection booth is enveloped inflames.
text: ALFREDO's body on the floor, burning. SALVATORE moves quickly, throws a blanket
text: over his shoulders, drags him by the feet over to the stairs, as boxes and other
text: objects fall on him. Using the same blanket, he stamps out the flames that have
text: seared ALFREDO'S clothes. With the force of desperation, he drags him further
text: down the stairs which have been reached by the smoke but not by the flames.
text: ALFREDO doesn't move, his face is burnt. SALVATORE looks at him and only now is
text: panic-stricken, lets out a terrified shriek, like a wounded colt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Alfredo! Heeeelp! Help!!!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 34 CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The plaster lion looks like a dragon spitting fire and smoke. The statue of the

dialog: 
scene_heading: 35 SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The fire has been put out. Nothing remains of the movie house but the skeleton.
text: Everything has gone up in smoke.
dialog: 
text: People stand around, dismayed. They gather around the PRIEST, who is at once
text: grieved and shocked, to express their solidarity and comfort.

text: inauguration film. Among the spectators, SALVATORE'S mother, MARIA, and his kid
text: sister, El A. Up on the screen, a man and a woman kiss. The first time a kiss
text: has been seen at the Cinema Paradiso. The audience murmurs, surprised and
dialog: excited.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: Ooooooh! They're kissing!! Look at
dialog: that!! Christ, that's news!!
dialog: 
text: An OLD LADY sitting next to the MAYOR, crosses herself, flabbergasted. CICCIO
text: SPACCAFICO chuckles. Rubs his hands: these are going to be golden times for him.
text: FATHER ADELFIO gets up and stalks out of the theatre, indignant; he'll
text: never set foot in the place again. The love theme gets louder and
dialog: louder...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 40 PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The same music spreads through the booth from the monitor. SALVATORE is by
text: himself. He is watching the film through the hole but strangely enough, the
text: story doesn't absorb him. ALFREDO'S absence makes him nervous, he gazes at the
text: stool he used to sit on. Il has been repainted. A voice from the rear of the
dialog: cabin:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNA'S VOICE
dialog: Toto?...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE turns and at the top of the stairs sees SIGNORA
text: ANNA and behind her, ALFREDO, her husband. He is wearing a
text: pair of dark glasses and walks with the kelp of a cane. He has
text: lost his sight, but not his spirit. He smiles:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Any room for me in this Cinema
dialog: Paradiso?
text: (SALVATORE runs over and
dialog: embraces him.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Come in, Alfredo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (to SALVATORE)
dialog: Toto, will you bring him home when
dialog: you close down?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Yes. Signora Anna.
speaker_heading: (To ALFREDO)
dialog: I'm glad you came.
dialog: 
dialog: Cut to:
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO is now sitting there immobile. He listens to the soundtrack of the film.
text: SALVATORE studies the way he stares into empty space, and the idea of darkness
text: frightens him. There is something new in ALFREDO'S manner, as if having grazed
dialog: death and the loss of his sight had endowed him with a deeper knowledge of men
dialog: and life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: How's school?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: OK. OK. But now that I've got a job,
dialog: I'11 probably stop going...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Don't do that...Sooner or later
dialog: you'll be left empty-handed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Why? What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Toto, this isn't for you. For the
dialog: moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs
dialog: you, and you need the Cinema
dialog: Paradiso. But it won't last...Some
dialog: day you'll have other things
dialog: to do, more important things...
dialog: (He reaches out and
text: touches SALVATORE'S face
dialog: to 'feel' his expression.)
dialog: That's right, more important. I know
dialog: it. Now that I've lost my sight I see
dialog: more.
dialog: I see everything I didn't see
dialog: before...
text: (As ALFREDO moves his hand
dialog: from SALVATORE's face, we
text: see that he is now a young
dialog: man, and that ALFREDO is
dialog: older, grayer.)
dialog: And it's all thanks to you, who saved
dialog: my life. And I'll never forget it...
dialog: (SALVATORE doesn't
dialog: understand his strange
dialog: words. ALFREDO can 'feel'
dialog: he is troubled.)
dialog: And don't put on that look. I haven't
dialog: gone off my head yet. You want proof?
dialog: 
text: And he gives a joking smile. SALVATORE is curious, expects one of his fiendish
dialog: tricks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Yes. I want proof.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: For example, at this moment the
dialog: film's out of focus. Go see.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE stands up in disbelief. He looks through the hole, and indeed the film
text: is out of focus. He puts it back into focus, flabbergasted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: It's hard to explain, Toto...

scene_heading: 41 CAFE IN THE SQUARE. INT/EXT. MORNING
dialog: 
text: As the BILL-POSTER attaches to the café door a poster of Catene - the
text: coming attraction at the Cinema Paradiso - CICCIO SPACCAFICO is
text: speaking on the phone in the phone booth. He is clearly peeved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: Only two days? Are you joking?!...
dialog: What do I care if all the copies
dialog: are reserved?...Catene for only two
dialog: days in a place like this! Why,
dialog: people will eat me alive!...
dialog: (Standing beside him
dialog: listening is SALVATORE. He
dialog: is carrying school
dialog: books under his ann. In
dialog: the café, several curious
text: ONLOOKERS laugh as through
text: the café window they watch
dialog: some unemployed PEASANT
dialog: MEN dancing together at
dialog: the club. SPACCAFICO
text: listens nervously, then
text: shrieks as if he were
dialog: about to eat the phone.)
dialog: ...I know, I know. But even if I
dialog: start showing at eight in the morning
dialog: it wouldn't be enough! This is a big
dialog: town now and you people at the
dialog: Titanus know it perfectly well! I'm
dialog: your sole agent and if I get pissed
dialog: off I'll write straight
dialog: to Lombardo, in Rome!! I'll give you
dialog: guys a good run-around!! If I get my
dialog: dander up, I can let fly, if my
dialog: name's Spaccafico!!
dialog: 
dialog: Cut to:
dialog: 
text: SPACCAFICO AND SALVATORE are now outside the café, head towards the square. In
text: front of the movie house, the CHARWOMAN is at work. SPACCAFICO is so nervous he
text: lights two cigarettes without noticing it. SALVATORE is turning something over
text: in his mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You
dialog: remember that old abandoned movie
dialog: house where they're supposed to build
dialog: those low-rent houses?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: So what's that got to do with it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: The projector's all rusty, but I
dialog: could fix it in two or three days.
dialog: Give the place a good cleaning, put
dialog: in some seats and bring in a
dialog: projectionist and we'll show Catene
dialog: in two houses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: (Shrieking)
dialog: What the fuck you talking about? You
dialog: getting into the act too, Toto?
dialog: Titanus has trouble giving me even
dialog: one copy and I have to say thanks! If
dialog: I ask for two, the least they'll do
dialog: is cut off my head and play ball with
dialog: it!
dialog: 
text: A shrewd look glitters in SALVATORE s eyes. He smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Who says we need two copies?
dialog: 
scene_heading: 42 CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The house is jammed with people. Almost bursting at the seams. The last scenes
text: of Catene move across the screen. Tears stream down the faces of the men and
text: women. The children are unusually silent. Even the BLACKSMITH is awake, indeed
text: whispers ahead of time all the lines of Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson, knows them by
text: heart. Among the crowd in the balcony there is ALFREDO and his wife, the MAYOR,
text: DON VINCENZO the landowner, the schoolteachers. Now the music is loud, heart-
text: rending. 'THE END' appears on screen. The lights go on. And there is a great
text: din and uproar as one audience leaves and another arrives. The race for empty
text: seats. Quarrels. The CARABINIERES help the USHER maintain order and persuade the
text: people who want to see the film again to get up and leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: USHER
dialog: (Exasperate])
dialog: That's enough now! You've seen it ten
dialog: times! I need the seats! I wish you'd

dialog: 
scene_heading: 43 CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT.
dialog: 
text: The end of the film slips through the sprockets. SALVATORE switches off the
text: motor. He is particularly fast in taking the reel out of the housing. And even
text: faster in dropping it into the sack BOCCIA is holding open for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Now get running and bring me the
dialog: first reel. Meanwhile I'll start
dialog: showing the news!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOCCIA
dialog: OK, Toto!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 44 VILLAGE STREETS AND COUNTRYSIDE. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: BOCCIA speeds like an arrow on his bicycle through the village streets. Tied to
text: the parcel-rack is the sack containing the second part of Catene. He now turns
text: off the main street and takes a short-cut down a country road. He pedals as fast
text: as he can. Until he disappears into the distance, beyond the trees.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 45 ENTRANCE OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: BOCCIA finally reaches the old movie house, which has been more or less spruced
text: up. Here too people are lined up in front of the posters of Catene. CICCIO
text: SPACCAFICO is waiting impatiently on an outside staircase. He too is holding a
text: sack, containing the first part of the film. The bicycle pulls up in front of
text: him. The sacks are exchanged.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: Quick! Give it to me! Here's the
dialog: first part. Get moving!
dialog: 
text: BOCCIA heads back to the Cinema Paradiso, to take the first part to SALVATORE.
text: SPACCAFICO dashes up the stairs, and hands the sack to a MAN standing in the
text: door, through which the bare projection booth can be seen, and the projector
text: which SALVATORE has put back into working order. SPACCAFICO yells in excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: Here you are! Quick, quick!! People
dialog: are waiting!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 46 OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: In fact, inside the old freezing cold movie house, the audience is grumbling.
text: Everyone is wrapped in overcoats and woollen scarves and are sitting on chairs
text: they've brought from home and wooden benches. The hum of the projector is heard
text: at last. The lights go down. The grumbling subsides. The words 'PART TWO' appear
text: on screen and then the images of the film.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 47 VARIOUS COUNTRY ROADS AND VILLAGE STREETS. EXT. DAY/SUNDOWN
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile BOCCIA pedals his way swiftly through the countryside on his way to
dialog: the Cinema Paradiso...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE.
dialog: 
text: Now BOCCIA is on his way back to the old movie house. To carry out another
text: exchange of sacks containing the reels of film.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE.
dialog: 
text: Another race back to Cinema Paradiso. BOCCIA starts looking tired, his breath is
text: short. And daylight starts fading into the colours of sundown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FADE.
dialog: 
text: The last fading light of sundown.-BOCCIA is pedalling once more back
text: to the old movie house. With the same sack tied to the parcel-rack. He
text: is exhausted. On his last legs. He slows down, then stops.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 48 CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
dialog:

scene_heading: 49 PROJECTION BOOTH. INT/EXT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: In the booth, the projector is turned off. SALVATORE looks nervously
text: out of the window...at the square. But not a sign of BOCCIA. A CARABINIERE
text: peers in through one of the holes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARABINIERE
dialog: What are we going to do, Toto? The
dialog: whole place here is up in arms.
dialog: They've been waiting more than a half

scene_heading: 5I VILLAGE STREETS AND COUNTRY ROADS. EXT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE has got himself a bicycle and is going off to look for
text: BOCCIA. He pedals fast, turns into the country short cut. Looks
text: around not a sign of Boccia. By now it is dark. He sees a MAN in the window of
text: a farmhouse, calls out to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Boccia! Boccia!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE rides on. Now he's in the open country. All of a sudden he seems to
text: hear something. He stops. Pricks up his ears. It's a sort of moan - he can't
text: figure out if it's an animal or a man. He turns on the flashlight he has brought
text: along. Takes a closer look around.
dialog: 
text: Catches sight of a bicycle wheel on the ground behind a bush. That's where the
text: moan is coming from! He creeps over in alarm. Next to the bicycle he now catches
text: sight of the sack with the film. And the moaning gets louder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Alarmed)
dialog: Boccia, what's wrong?
text: (He runs over to help his
text: friend. Behind the bush he
dialog: discovers BOCCIA humped up
text: between the legs of
text: TERESA, a prostitute. He
dialog: moves with all the fury
dialog: of his young years.
dialog: SALVATORE has never seen
dialog: people making love before
dialog: and is speechless.)
dialog: Damn you, what are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOCCIA
dialog: (Shouting)
dialog: Oh, Christ, it's so good!!!
dialog: (And he goes on ramming it
dialog: home.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: Hey, cut it out! Go away. Shoo!
dialog: 
text: With a confused look on his face, SALVATORE picks up the sack and walks away,
text: looking over his shoulder at the couple who go on tossing around more and more
dialog: frantically.
dialog: 
text: BOCCIA lets out a shriek of pleasure that rings through the countryside, as
text: SALVATORE pedals off like a madman and disappears into the trees.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 52 CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY/EVENING
dialog: 
text: Music and the naked body of Brigitte Bardot. A row of youngsters on the main
text: floor stare at the naked actress, all excited. A regular rhythmic tremor runs
text: through them, half-hidden by the back of the seats.
dialog: 
text: A scene from a horror film. The frightened faces of the audience. Off in one
text: corner, the door of the men's toilet opens and a MAN with a contented look comes
text: out, followed by TERESA, who motions another one to come in. In the projection
text: booth, SALVATORE is eating the meal his mother has brought him.
dialog: 
text: A gangster film. The tense faces of the audience. A gun battle. Rounds of
text: machine-gunfire in the night. The shots echo through the theatre. A LITTLE BOY
text: claps his hands over his ears. Alternating with the machine-gunfire on screen, a
text: real pistol shoots the back of one of the spectators, the landowner DON
text: VINCENZO, who slumps down in his seat without anybody noticing...The shooting
text: continues up on screen...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE'S hand holds a lighted match under a piece of film, before the
text: horrified eyes of SPACCAFICO and the USHER, and the puzzled expression of
speaker_heading: ALFREDO.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch
dialog: fire!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Progress! It always arrives too late!
dialog: 
text: A scene from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The only empty seat
text: in the theatre is the one where DON VINCENZO was killed. A flower
text: has been tied to it with string. All the other seats are taken.
dialog: 
dialog: Fade to:
dialog: 
text: ROSA and ANGELO are sitting next to each other. They are watching a
text: different film. But she has a baby in her arms they have got married,
dialog: have set up a family.
dialog: 
text: In the balcony, the MAN with the face of a public notary spits down
text: below with a contented look. But this time the main floor takes its
text: revenge and a blob of shit hits him square in the face.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 53 CINEMA PARADISO. INT. MORNING
dialog: 
text: In the morning the theatre is empty. All the doors are shut. Light filters in
text: through the open windows up above, illuminates the posters of coming attractions
text: and the yellowish screen. Off-screen, a woman's voice
text: and a boy's voice are heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA'S VOICE

dialog: Come on...That's right...relax...

dialog: (Off-screen)
dialog: Is it true that if I bleed I've got
dialog: to squeeze lemon juice on it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA'S VOICE (Off-screen)
dialog: (A loud laugh)
dialog: Lemon juice?...That's a new one for
dialog: you! Who tells you this crap...Take
dialog: it easy...That's right...You see,
dialog: it's not painful, is it?
dialog: 
text: Slow pan along the walls of the theatre, the empty aisles,
text: discovers SALVATORE on the floor between the seats with
text: TERESA, the prostitute who has already been seen. SALVATORE is
text: making love for the first time in his life. He is awkward and
text: clumsy. There is an uncertain look in his eyes, his livid face is
text: dripping with sweat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERESA
dialog: ...There you are! That's right,
dialog: that's right! Keep going...
dialog: (SALVATORE is quicker, has
dialog: learned the lesson. TERESA
dialog: goads him on.)
dialog: Ah!!! There, now you're a real man! A
dialog: man! ? A real calf!
dialog: (SALVATORE's panting
text: slackens into a deep sigh
dialog: of pleasure.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: 54 VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The blade of a knife, clutched in a hardened hand. A blow. A cry of pain. A calf
text: falls like a dead weight to the ground...SALVATORE photographs the animal in
text: the throes of death with his 8mm movie camera. As well as the faces of the MEN
text: who now bleed and skin it quickly. In the vast slaughter-house, the voices of
text: the men and animals mingle together.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE'S eye is quick to catch the most unexpected expressions of ordinary
text: people. His movie camera is always ready, like a hunter's rifle. Now he is
dialog: shooting...
dialog: 
text: A meeting in the square: the passionate reactions of the peasants listening to a
text: speaker who flails his arms around.
dialog: 
text: At school: the old SCHOOLMISTRESS sitting at her desk, sunk in God knows what
text: dreams, her eyes staring off into empty space, as a tear runs down her pale,
text: unhappy face, and the unknowing STUDENTS carry out their assignments.
dialog: 
text: At the railroad station: the nervous excitement of the people waiting on the
text: platforms. SALVATORE pans his camera on to TWO MEN fighting. But an arriving
text: train comes in between. Salvatore follows the train, pans along the cars. The
text: train stops.
dialog: 
text: -A door opens and the passengers climb out. Several TRADERS, a CARABINTERE, a
text: group of commuting STUDENTS, the TICKET-COLLECTOR, a distinguished looking
text: COUPLE and lastly, a GIRL who stops in the middle of the viewfinder. SALVATORE
text: is immediately attracted by her face. He goes on shooting without leaving it a
text: moment. He follows her through the lens. She is very beautiful, must be around
text: sixteen, a simple, sweet face, blue eyes. She is certainly the daughter of the
text: distinguished looking COUPLE who got off just before she did. The little family
text: moves off down the platform. Salvatore follows the girl's movements, as if
text: hypnotized. Now she passes by him, turns towards him for one moment, as if
text: trying to figure out where he is aiming that funny-looking gadget. SALVATORE
text: smiles at her, entranced.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 55 HIGH SCHOOL. COURTYARD. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING
dialog: 
text: The JANITOR is ringing the bell. In the courtyard, on the other side of
text: the gate, the STUDENTS prepare to enter. SALVATORE is with a group
text: of schoolmates, including BOCCIA. And they all stare, wide-eyed, at
text: the GIRL from the station. She has her books under her arm and is
text: walking by herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: You know that one there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOCCIA
dialog: She's new. Not bad though. Nice-
dialog: looking.
dialog: (SALVATORE has the look of
dialog: somebody seeking for an
dialog: idea, some way of picking
dialog: up a conversation with
dialog: her.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND STUDENT
dialog: Her father s the new bank director.
dialog: Loaded, luxury and easy living!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIRST STUDENT
text: People who jerk off with a shirt so
dialog: they won't get their hands dirty.
dialog: (Laughs.)
dialog: 
text: All at once, BOCCIA and SALVATORE notice that the GIRL drops
text: her lunch without noticing as she is about to enter the school. They
text: fly off, swift as arrows. It's a chance not to be missed. BOCCIA is
text: the quicker, is already in the lead. SALVATORE gives an angry
text: gesture. A flash come into his eyes, the same flash he had as a little
text: boy when he finds the right way to hit home. He picks up his step,
text: trips BOCCIA and brings him to the ground. He pounces on him
text: and lets go with his fist. He starts running again. Picks the
text: bundle off the ground. Catches up with the GIRL from the
text: station, nervous and inexperienced, but polite.
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Look, you dropped this.
dialog: 
text: And he hands her her lunch with a smile. She recognizes him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Oh, thanks. I hadn't noticed...
dialog: 
text: She takes the bundle as SALVATORE touches her hand delicately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: My name's Salvatore...And yours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Elena. My name's Elena.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is very flustered. He feels as if all his blood were
text: throbbing in his head. He tries to say something else, but the words
text: catch in his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I...I...The other time at the
dialog: station.
dialog: 
text: BOCCIA suddenly grabs him by the collar and yanks him away. ELENA is frightened,
text: puts her hand over her eyes so as not to see.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 56:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE has a black eye, swollen shut. He is setting up a little 8mm projector
text: on a stool. ALFREDO is sitting in one corner. He has come to keep him company.
text: He listens to the sound-track of the movie being shown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: That's right, Modern Times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: I've shown it so many times I know it
dialog: by heart. The first time I showed
dialog: it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first
dialog: wife died. They kept it hidden from
dialog: me all day so they wouldn't have to
dialog: close down the movie house. I only
dialog: found out that night, after the last
dialog: show. Those are things you never
dialog: forget...
dialog: (Changing his tone.)
dialog: So, Toto, how are these home movies
dialog: going?
text: (SALVATORE has switched on
dialog: the little projector and a
text: square of light appears on
text: the wall beside ALFREDO,
text: with the scenes shot in
dialog: town.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (The shots of the

dialog: appeared.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: What is it, what is it? What's the
dialog: picture?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: It's people in the slaughter-house
dialog: killing a calf. There's blood all
text: over the floor, like a lake. And
dialog: through this lake another calf passes
text: by on its way to die.
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO is concentrated, as if SALVATORE'S description transmitted the
text: real image to him, the colours, the forms. The railway station has appeared on
text: the wall, and the sequence of ELENA. SALVATORE does not move, does not say a
text: word, as he gazes at those blue eyes looking into the camera. ALFREDO senses
text: something funny in the boy's s11ence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Now what can you see?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Nothing, there's nothing. It's all

speaker_heading: ALFREDO

dialog: Is there a woman?...Tell me the
dialog: truth...
dialog: (SALVATORE is shamed,
dialog: uncertain, doesn't know
dialog: whet to say. A tender look
speaker_heading: filters through ALFREDO's
text: dark glasses. He has
dialog: obviously caught on and
dialog: whispers:)
text: There is a woman.

speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Yes, it's a girl I saw at the
dialog: station.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: What's she like? What's she like?...
dialog: 
text: And as other shots of ELENA appear on the screen, SALVATORE describes her. As
dialog: only somebody in love could.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: She's nice. My age...Slender, with
text: long hair, brunette. She had big blue
text: eyes, a simple expression and a
text: little beauty mark on her lip, but
dialog: really tiny. You can only see it
text: close-up. And when she smiles...She
dialog: makes you feel...
dialog: 
text: He stops. Only now does he realize that he has let himself be carried away by
text: passion, by the desire to talk about her. ALFREDO smiles, spellbound...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Eh! Love...what a mystery!
text: (SALVATORE turns off the
text: projector and heaves a
dialog: deep sigh, almost of
speaker_heading: liberation. ALFREDO'S
dialog: sympathy does him a lot of
dialog: good. It's nice to be
text: understood. He moves over
text: closer to him. ALFREDO
text: runs his hand through his
dialog: hair, whispers:)
dialog: I understand you, Toto...The ones
dialog: with blue eyes are the
dialog: most beautiful. Whatever you do, you
dialog: can't make friends with
dialog: them.
text: (SALVATORE is comforted by
dialog: the way he talks. He
dialog: didn't think it
dialog: was possible to put into
dialog: words the things he has
dialog: felt since meeting
text: ELENA. He nods his head.
speaker_heading: ALFREDO sighs.)
dialog: Eh, there's nothing to be done about
dialog: it! The heavier a man is,
dialog: the deeper his footprints. And if
dialog: he's in love, he suffers,
dialog: because he knows he's up a one-way
dialog: street. Because love is a
dialog: meaningless thing when a man gets it
dialog: into his head to do what
dialog: he wants...
dialog: (SALVATORE is touched by
dialog: his sensitivity, by his
dialog: intense, passionate, sweet
dialog: way of speaking.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: What you say is wonderful! But sad...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: They're not my words. John Wayne said
dialog: it in Shepherd of the Hills.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE suddenly changes expression, as if discovering he was being made fun
dialog: of.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Stinking two-timer!!
dialog: (And they burst out
dialog: laughing.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: 57:CINEMAPARADISOANDVARIOUSSTREETS.EXT.DAY
dialog: 
text: A grey, windy day. It is opening-time and the shutters of the movie
text: house are being rolled up. SALVATORE is about to enter through the
text: small door of the spiral staircase, when in the distance he catches sight
dialog: of...
dialog: 
text: ELENA crossing a street with her books under her arm. She is alone.
text: SALVATORE doesn't stop to think twice, dashes off, runs through streets
text: full of dust, another square, turns the corner, but has lost sight of her.
text: He looks around in all directions there she is! He starts running again.
text: And finally catches up with her, all out of breath, practically
text: speechless with emotion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Hi, Elena!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Hi. Why are you running?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: No particular reason...
text: (He is entranced by her
dialog: eyes. He wants to tell her
dialog: all sorts of
dialog: things, say all the words
dialog: he has memorized a
dialog: thousand times. But
dialog: now he can't get them out.
text: His knees tremble. He does
dialog: his best to
dialog: overcome his confusion,
dialog: but all that comes out
dialog: is:)
dialog: Nice day, huh?
text: (A gust of wind envelops
text: them in a cloud of dust
text: and a clap of
text: thunder rends the air.
text: ELENA laughs, amused by
dialog: the blunder.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Yes, nice day.
text: (SALVATORE laughs too. He
text: gazes at her long hair
text: tossed by the wind. She
dialog: turns to leave.)
dialog: ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Bye-bye, Elena.
text: (ELENA walks away. And
text: SALVATORE also turns to
dialog: leave. Only now is he
dialog: seized by disappointment,
dialog: regret at not having made
dialog: the best of the
dialog: opportunity. He talks to
dialog: himself.)
dialog: ...What an idiot! What an idiot!
dialog: 'Nice day'! Christ!!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 58:SALVATORE'S BEDROOM.INT.DAY
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE projects images of ELENA on his wall. He lies across his bed gazing at
dialog: her image.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: You probably don't believe me, but
dialog: I'm going to become the leading man
dialog: in your life. Sure, I don't look like
dialog: Marlon Brando, but look at me, really
dialog: look at me. Am I really so ugly? So
dialog: should I try once more? Maybe It'll
dialog: succeed. What do you
dialog: say?
dialog: 
text: ELENA seems to be saying, Yes. As SALVATORE kisses ELENA, her image disappears.
text: He is left with his face against the wall in the white light from the
dialog: projector.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 59:PHONEB00TH AND ELENA'S HOUSE.INT.DAY
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is in a phone booth. The telephone will certainly help him feel less
dialog: nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Hello, can I speak to Elena, please?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMANS VOICE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: (SALVATORE recognizes
text: ELENA's voice, changes his
dialog: tone, turns sweeter, more
dialog: personal.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Is that you, Elena?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Yes...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize
dialog: your voice. This is Salvatore,
dialog: remember?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'SVOICE
dialog: Yes...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE finally speaks, says everything all in one breath, without stopping,
text: without hesitating, in order to leave no room for shyness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Listen, I know that every time we see
dialog: each other I make a fool of myself,
dialog: but I'm not like that, I swear. It's
dialog: just that when I see you, I feel shy,
dialog: the right words don't come to me, I
dialog: don't have the courage to say that
dialog: all I do is think about you...
dialog: (He has finally got it
text: out. He's dripping with
dialog: sweat, but happy at having
dialog: succeeded. He continues.)
dialog: That's right, Elena, you're the last
dialog: thing I think of when I go to sleep
dialog: and the first when I wake up in the
dialog: morning. And at night I always dream
dialog: of you. I know, it's not good on the
dialog: phone. But please, don't get me
dialog: wrong. Because I love you very
dialog: much...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'SVOICE
dialog: (Interrupting him)
dialog: If you don't stop phoning her, I'm
dialog: calling the police!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Stunned)
dialog: But excuse me, who's speaking?
dialog: 
text: At ELENA'S house, a WOMAN who is visibly in a state is speaking on the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA'S MOTHER
dialog: I'm Elena's mother, you filthy pig!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE feels like dropping through the floor, tries to get a word in to
text: explain, to apologize, but the flood of insults overwhelms him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I'm sorry, Signora, maybe there's a
dialog: misunderstanding...I...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: And don't call my daughter any more.
dialog: Never!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE has no choice but to hang up, disappointed, defeated. He's so mad he
text: starts slapping himself.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 60:ALFREDO'S HOUSE.EXT.AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Good Friday. ALFREDO comes out of his house, leaning on
text: SALVATORE's shoulder. They go off down the street, towards the
text: church. SALVATORE has finished recounting his misadventure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: I told you, the blue-eyed ones are
dialog: the most difficult.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: But why? There must be some way to
dialog: make her understand!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Don't think about it, Toto. Don't
dialog: even try. With feelings, there's
dialog: nothing to understand.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE gives an angry gesture. This time ALFREDO'S words do not quiet his
text: frenzy, don't help him. He moves away from him a few steps.
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO stands there motionless in the middle of the road.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Stop it! I've had enough of your
dialog: sermons! You act as if you created
dialog: the world!
dialog: (A bicycle streaks by
text: ALFREDO, who gives a
text: startled jump, as if it
dialog: were about to
text: run into him. He raises
dialog: his voice, panic-
dialog: stricken.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off
dialog: with me now! Come here! I don't
dialog: know where the fuck I have to go.
text: (A MAN on a bicycle almost
text: collides with ALFREDO.
text: SALVATORE fumes, goes over
text: to him listlessly. ALFREDO
text: puts his hand back on his
dialog: shoulder and they start
text: walking again. ALFREDO has
dialog: calmed down, but his voice
dialog: is determined.)
dialog: And the next time be careful how you
dialog: talk. Not to take credit away
dialog: from the Lord, but if I had created
dialog: the world, in all modesty, certain
dialog: things would have come out better.
dialog: But unfortunately such was not the
dialog: case.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Laughing)
dialog: You see, it s like I say. You always
dialog: have an answer for everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm
dialog: going to tell you a story.
dialog: (And he squeezes
text: SALVATORE'S shoulder. It's
dialog: the signal for taking a
text: rest. They sit in a
text: doorway. ALFREDO starts
dialog: telling his story, and his
dialog: way of speaking is
text: hypnotic, magical. With
dialog: those eyes lost in empty
dialog: space, it's as if his
dialog: thoughts and his words
dialog: came in from some other
dialog: dimension, mysterious,
dialog: hidden...)
dialog: Once upon a time a king gave a feast
dialog: and there were all the most beautiful
dialog: princesses of the realm. Basta, one
dialog: of the guards, saw the king's
dialog: daughter: she was the loveliest of
dialog: all! And he immediately fell in love
dialog: with her. But what could a poor
dialog: soldier do compared with a king's
dialog: daughter?!...One day he managed
dialog: to meet her and told her he couldn't
dialog: live without her. The princess was so
dialog: struck by the depth of his feeling
dialog: that she said to the soldier 'If you
dialog: will wait a hundred days and a
dialog: hundred nights beneath my balcony,
dialog: then in the end I'll be yours.'
dialog: Christ, the soldier ran off there and
dialog: waited! One day, two days,
dialog: ten, twenty...Every night she looked
text: out of her window, but he never
dialog: budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never
text: budged! The birds shat on him and the
dialog: bees ate him alive! After ninety
text: nights he was gaunt and pale and
text: tears streamed from his eyes but he
dialog: couldn't hold them back. He didn't
dialog: even have the strength to sleep any
dialog: more. The princess kept watch...And
dialog: on the ninety-ninth night, the
text: soldier got up, picked up his chair
dialog: and left!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: No! You mean right at the end?
dialog: (SALVATORE is amazed,
dialog: dumbfounded; that ending
dialog: has made a deep
dialog: impression. They
dialog: start walking again.)
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: That's right, Toto, right at the end?
dialog: And don't ask me what it means. If
dialog: you figure it out, let me know...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I'll be damned'
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6I:CHURCH.INT.EVENING
dialog: 
text: Before the high altar, the Virgin Mary in tears clutches three spikes inher
text: hand. And beside her is another statue Christ descended from the
text: cross. MEN and WOMEN stand in line to kiss Christ's wounds. Many people are
text: sitting between the pews. SALVATORE helps ALFREDO take a seat, and at that
text: moment catches sight at the far end of ELENA on her way to the confessional.
dialog: 
text: She kneels down on one side, just as FATHER ADELFIO comes out of the middle
text: booth and goes to the altar to say something to the sacristan. SALVATORE'S eyes
text: light up. He has had a brainstorm.
dialog: 
text: He leans over and whispers something into ALFREDO's ear. ALFREDO nods his head.
text: SALVATORE is so happy that he gives him a pat on the cheek, like a caress. Then
text: he hurries over to the PRIEST. Says something in a low voice, gesticulates with
text: some agitation, points to the pew where ALFREDO is sitting. The PRIEST tries to
text: say he can't now, but SALVATORE insists, and wins. The PRIEST goes over to
text: ALFREDO, leans over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of
dialog: all times!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (In a grave voice)
dialog: Father Adelfio, I have a very serious
dialog: doubt that is torturing my soul. And
dialog: you've got to help me, because I've
dialog: lost all peace of mind...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE watches from a distance. He sees the PRIEST put on an alarmed
text: expression and then sit down beside ALFREDO. Everything's ready. He creeps over
text: to the confessional. ELENA is there, kneeling down waiting for the PRIEST to
text: arrive. In an instant, without anyone noticing, SALVATORE pops inside the
text: confessional. He shuts the little door below and draws the purple curtain. On
text: the other side of grille, only a few inches away, those eyes that keep him awake
dialog: all night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Father, I have sinned...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (In a low voice)
dialog: We'll talk about that later.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (Surprised)
dialog: But...who...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Interrupting her)
dialog: Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend
dialog: everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
dialog: 
text: ELENA'S eyes pop in amazement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: What are you doing here?
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile ALFREDO and the PRIEST continue their unusual and animated discussion.
text: The PRIEST is appalled, crosses himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: But Alfredo, what you're saying is
dialog: horrifying!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: I know. But take the-miracle of the
dialog: loaves and fishes, for example! I
dialog: think about it a lot...How is it
dialog: possible for...
dialog: 
text: In the confessional, the whispered conversation between SALVATORE and ELENA
dialog: continues.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (Annoyed)
text: There was a terrible rumpus at home.
dialog: My mother told my father. And how
dialog: could you have mistaken my voice?!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is mortified, on tenterhooks, keeps an eye on ALFREDO and the PRIEST
text: through a crack in the curtain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Forgive me, Elena. It was stupid of
dialog: me. But I had to talk to you.
dialog: 
text: She looks up at him and her eyes are even more beautiful in the candlelight.
text: This time SALVATORE finds the courage to speak to her calmly, with
text: determination. That grille probably helps him, allows him to see without being
dialog: seen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: You're so beautiful, Elena...That's
dialog: what I wanted to tell you. When I
dialog: meet you, I can't put two words
dialog: together because...you give me the
dialog: shivers. I don't know what you do in
dialog: these situations, what you're
dialog: supposed to say. It's the first time.
dialog: But I think I'm in love with you.
dialog: 
text: ELENA gazes through the grille at the two shining specks of his eyes. She is
text: bewildered by that flood of passion. At that moment, an OLD WOMAN kneels down on
text: the other side of the confessional and her face appears behind the grille.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Father, I have sinned...
dialog: (SALVATORE turns lo her,
dialog: instinctively.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I absolve you in the name of the
dialog: Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
dialog: Go in peace, my daughter.
text: (And he slams the panel
text: shut in her face. ELENA is
dialog: barely able to control her
dialog: laughter.)
dialog: When you laugh, you're even more
dialog: beautiful.
dialog: 
text: She pulls herself together again and puts on a serious, but tender look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Salvatore, it's awfully sweet of you.
dialog: And even though I don't know you, I
dialog: like you. But...I'm not in love with
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: For SALVATORE, it's as if a knife had plunged straight into his heart. He sits
text: there gazing into her eyes, at the beauty mark on her lip, without moving. Then
text: through the crack sees ALFREDO and the PRIEST conversing nervously, God knows
text: what they're saying. And he turns back to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I don't care. I'll wait.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: For what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: For you to fall in love with me too.
dialog: Listen carefully. Every night, when I
dialog: get off work, I'll come and wait
dialog: beneath your window. Every night.
dialog: When you change your mind, open your
dialog: window. That's all. I'll
dialog: understand...
dialog: 
text: He smiles at her. She is upset by those exaggerated words, but also intrigued.
dialog: 
text: The PRIEST has meanwhile solved the problem that ALFREDO has made up as an
dialog: excuse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (Exhausted)
dialog: You understand now? You see it
dialog: clearly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Hypocritically)
dialog: Oh yes, father. Now everything's
dialog: clear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: And the next time don't go around
dialog: saying such heresy. You survived the
text: fire at the movie house. But no one
dialog: can save you from the fire of Hell!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 62:SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sweet poignant music accompanies SALVATORE's long waits beneath the window of
text: ELENA'S room... A warm early summer night. The last spectators wander off into
text: the streets. The VILLAGE IDIOT makes his rounds of the square.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is beneath her window. He waits. The shutters are open,
text: but not the windows with the curtains. ELENA peers at him through a
dialog: dark crack...
dialog: 
dialog: Fade to:
dialog: 
text: A rainy night. SALVATORE is back there again. Determined,
text: headstrong. A dog keeps him company, taking shelter under an
text: overhanging roof. The window is shut...
dialog: 
dialog: Fade to:
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE'S hand adds another check to an endless row of checks on
dialog: the calendar. A check a day...
dialog: 
dialog: Fade to:
dialog: 
text: Another night. Wind. The window is still shut. SALVATORE's eyes are
text: the eyes of a lovesick man prepared to face the hardest battles, just to
text: win, just to conquer his loved one. She peeks at him through the crack,
dialog: but he can't see her...
dialog: 
dialog: Fade to:
dialog: 
text: The paces of the calendar are covered with checks. Several months
text: have gone by. SALVATORE adds a check on the last page, on 30 December. Tomorrow
text: night will be...New Year's Eve. The streets are empty. Loud merry voices can be
text: heard coming from the houses. Old discarded objects hail down from balconies.
text: Firecrackers explode here and there. SALVATORE is there in the same old place,
text: as usual. The shutters are open, but not the windows, and all is darkness
text: inside. SALVATORE is wrapped in a large overcoat and stamps his feet to keep
dialog: warm...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 63:SALVATORES HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Toasts are being prepared in SALVATORE's house. MARIA is there
text: with her daughter, LIA, then ALFREDO with his wife, ANNA.
text: SALVATORE is the only one missing for the "family" to be complete.
text: The bottle of spumante and the Christmas cake are ready. The radio is
text: on with the New Year's Eve programme.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (Nervously)
dialog: But why hasn't Toto shown up? The
dialog: movie house is closed at this hour!
dialog: 
text: ALFREDO has a know-all look. He tries to put her mind at rest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: He had to do something for me...
dialog: 
text: Over the radio, music and merrymaking
dialog: 
scene_heading: 64:ELENA'S HOUSE.EXT.NIGHT
dialog: 
text: More sounds of merrymaking, coming from ELENA's house. SALVATORE listens to it,
text: sees the shadows of her parents and relatives, maybe even hers, ready to
text: celebrate, welcome in the New Year. But further on, that window remains dark and
text: shut. SALVATORE gazes at it again.
dialog: 
text: There is a new look in his eyes, like a gleam of hope. Maybe it's the
dialog: specialness of that night, maybe it's the fire crackers, the festive atmosphere,
text: but something tells him that's going to be the right night. The night when
text: she'll open her window. In fact, a light suddenly goes on in the room.
text: SALVATORE'S eyes sparkle, have already taken on the hue of victory.
dialog: 
text: The window is pulled open, and his heart starts pounding like a drum. The music
text: reaches its climax. Two hands come out. SALVATORE shuts his eyes for a moment,
text: to hold back the flood of feeling. He opens them again and sees......The hands
text: reach out and take hold of the shutters and pull them shut. The light goes out.
text: It is midnight. An echoing voice does the countdown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE
dialog: Six, five, four, three, two, one,
dialog: zero! Happy New Year! Happy New Year!
dialog: 
text: And a roar of voices, shouts, explosions, fills the air. SALVATORE has remained
text: standing there immobile, speechless. Disappointed. Defeated.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 65 SALVATORE S HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: At his house, glasses are about to be raised. There is a strange, tense
text: merriment. MARIA is unable to conceal her concern, her presentiment. She glances
text: at the door, hoping to see SALVATORE appear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (To Maria)
dialog: There's nothing to worry about. He's
text: probably with his friends.
dialog: (To all)
dialog: Let's toast!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EVERYBODY
dialog: (Toasting)
dialog: Here's to you! Here's to you! Happy
dialog: New Year!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA

dialog: New Year! !
dialog: 
text: Everybody echoes MARIA'S toast...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 66 ELENA S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: But SALVATORE is not happy in these first few minutes of the New Year. He feels
text: hurt, humiliated, rejected. He walks off amidst the old discarded objects flying
text: down from the terraces. That was his last night. He's not showing up beneath
dialog: that balcony any more.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 67 CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Outside there is a violent thunderstorm. The pounding of the rain and the
text: rumbling of the thunder drown out the sound-track of the film being shown. Two
text: buckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof. SALVATORE
text: is alone. For the first time he feels he hates the profession he's got into. He
text: is tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for
text: ELENA. He tears it into a thousand pieces, as if trying to wipe out the traces
text: of his grief. He is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't notice that
text: someone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room. And
text: now stands there watching him in silence. The thunder is deafening. That someone
text: is ELENA. She comes up behind him, realizes he is thinking
text: about her. Whispers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Salvatore...
dialog: 
text: Loud passionate music is heard on the monitor. SALVATORE turns and sees her as
text: if in a dream. It is a sudden blow to the heart. The look on her face is
text: wonderfully sweet, the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and
text: who now realizes at last that she is in love too. For SALVATORE it is an
text: overwhelming, almost unbearable moment...A long passionate embrace that is
text: never-ending. They are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other
dialog: again.
dialog: 
text: They spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the
text: first-part endings and the trailers. Another intense look, their eyes
text: locked...And it is their first kiss. A kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost
text: clumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant. Amidst the film strips dangling
text: around and touching their young faces. Meanwhile the film has finished, the
text: projector turns uselessly...Down below the screen is blank, the audience
text: whistles...But SALVATORE hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless
text: whirring of the reels in the projector. All he hears is her breathing, an he
dialog: feels is the warmth of her
dialog: skin.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 68 VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The happiest, most vivid moments SALVATORE and ELENA spend
dialog: together:
dialog: 
text: A country outing. They eat a lavish salad using the flat branches of the
dialog: prickly pear for plates.
dialog: 
text: A chase through an endless field of wheat.
text: In the projection booth. A cake with seventeen lighted candles.
text: SALVATORE and ELENA blow them out together. And then a kiss.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 69 ROAD AT THE EDGE OF TOWN.EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is driving an old beaten-up Balilla he bought from a
text: car-wrecker. ELENA sits beside him, having the time of her life. They
text: roar with laughter. The car jolts, moves by fits and starts, jarred by the
dialog: holes in the road, and besides SALVATORE is not such a hot driver. She
text: fondles him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (Ironically)
dialog: You have a great future as a driver.
dialog: If they don't arrest you first!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: That's nothing to do with it, it's
text: the car that's still being run in...
dialog: 
text: He has barely finished the last sentence when the car gives a
text: sudden violent shudder. A sharp report. A cloud of white smoke issues from the
text: motor. And the Balilla stops dead in its tracks. ELENA and SALVATORE cannot
text: smother their wild laughter. They embrace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: SO now how do we get home?
dialog: 
dialog: Cut to:
dialog: 
text: The two of them are standing beside the empty road, looking bored, as they have
text: already been waiting a long time for someone to go by, a car, a wagon. When all
text: at once a car comes around the bend, heading for town. SALVATORE and ELENA flag
dialog: it down.
dialog: 
text: The DRIVER slows down. The back door opens, a MAN gets out. An alarmed and
text: startled look comes over ELENA's face that man is her FATHER. She sees him
text: stride over in a rage.
dialog: 
text: He has almost reached SALVATORE, who tries lo be polite, to make the best of the
dialog: situation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Hello, Dr Mendola...Hem...
dialog: 
text: ELENA buries her face in her hands, so as not to see...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 70 CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE has a bruise on his cheek and two Band-aids on his face.
text: He got himself a good thrashing, and then some. The house is jammed,
text: as on the great occasions. Curiosity is written all over the faces of the
text: audience. But what they're seeing is not a film, but an instalment of
text: Double or Nothing. SALVATORE is standing by a teleprojector which
text: has been set up in the central aisle of the balcony. It is a machine that
text: makes it possible to project television show on the screen. ALFREDO is
text: sitting beside him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (In a low voice)
dialog: Toto, are you pulling my leg or
dialog: something? How is it possible to see
dialog: this television without film?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any.
dialog: And if you buy a television set, you
dialog: can watch it at home, without any
dialog: fuss...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Sceptically)
dialog: Could be...But I don't like this
dialog: business. It smells fishy to me.
dialog: 
text: ELENA is sitting in one corner of the balcony with her parents. Sitting beside
text: her FATHER is the owner of the movie house, SPACCAFICO, who thanks him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: (In a low voice)
dialog: You see what a bright idea, Dr
dialog: Mendola? But without the bank loan
dialog: how could I have bought the machine?
dialog: If we don't get organized around
dialog: here, in this day and age, we'll meet
dialog: the same end as the Punch and Judy
dialog: shows!
dialog: 
text: ELENA is not very interested in the TV show. She sneaks a look at SALVATORE.
text: From the looks on their faces, it is clear that things are not going very well.
text: He gives her a nod, as if to say he wants to speak to her and that she should
text: figure out some way! ELENA leans over to her MOTHER, whispers something into her
dialog: ear.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 7I CINEMA PARADISO. TOILET. INT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: ELENA's MOTHER stands waiting in front of the women's toilet,
text: gazing at Mike Bongiorno emceeing the TV show in the distance.
dialog: 
text: Inside the toilet, ELENA is standing on the toilet seat whispering to
text: SALVATORE, who is standing on the 20ilet seat of the men's toilet.
dialog: 
text: Their eyes are barely able to peek over the flush tank which they have
text: uncovered. ELENA is worried.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Could it be your father doesn't like
dialog: the work I do...That my family's too
dialog: poor...Is that it?
dialog: 
text: She gives a nod of the head, but only faintly, so as no2 to wound his
text: vulnerability. SALVATORE sighs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA'S MOTHER
dialog: (Off-screen)
dialog: Elena!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: All right! !
dialog: (To Salvatore, in a
dialog: whisper)
dialog: For the moment it's impossible to see
dialog: each other...As soon as school is
dialog: out, we're going to go stay with
dialog: friends in Tuscany. We'll be there
dialog: all summer...Maybe if you came up,
dialog: we could meet in secret...
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Crestfallen)
dialog: But we're opening the outdoor movie
dialog: theatre this summer. What will I do
dialog: all this time without seeing you?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I'll write to you every day. Don't
dialog: worry. I love you. The summer'll be
dialog: over and I'll be back...
dialog: 
text: They reach out to kiss each other. Who knows when they'll be able to see each
dialog: other again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA'S MOTHER
dialog: (Off-screen)
dialog: Elena!
dialog: 
text: ELENA climbs down, pulls the chain and walks off, leaving SALVATORE standing
text: there on the toilet seat.
dialog: 
text: Summer has come. A bevy of barefoot children chase after the carts carrying the
text: carters' families to the beach to go swimming. SALVATORE, helped by the USHER,
text: has finished loading the disassembled projector on to a wagon in order to carry
text: it to the outdoor movie house. The USHER has hung a sign on the Cinema Paradiso
dialog: to the effect that 'Showings to continue at the Imperia Arena', and now climbs
text: into the wagon.
dialog: 
text: The horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds
dialog: SALVATORE that the summer is going to be long this year, longer than ever. And
text: he leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the
text: wheels. A cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the
text: wagon. There are the MEN from the slaughter-house. They recognize SALVATORE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SLAUGHTER-HOUSE MAN
dialog: Well, look who's here!! Cecil B. De
dialog: Mille! Hey, Toto!! When are you
dialog: coming to shoot another film?!?
dialog: 
text: And they laugh, with their gaping toothless mouths. SALVATORE doesn't feel like
text: joking, not even like answering. He looks away, so as not to see their leers. He
dialog: wants to be by himself.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 73 BEACH AND IMPERIA ARENA. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The beach is almost deserted, dotted here and there with groups of bathers. The
text: carts and horses are scattered in the sand, near the Imperia Arena, where some
text: WORKMEN are putting on the finishing touches for the new opening. The wagon
text: arrives and SALVATORE and the USHER unload the projector.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 74 BEACH. IMPERIA ARENA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT.EVENING
dialog: 
text: A sultry evening. The jacklights of the octopus fishers twinkle on the
text: dark horizon. The sound-track of a comic film reverberates over the sea,
text: the laughter of the audience mingles with the sound of the shallow waves
text: breaking on the rocks. A group of LITTLE BOYS in a boat pulls away
text: from shore. They join some more boats standing still in the water, all of
text: them crammed with LITTLE BOYS all looking in the same direction...
text: towards the screen of the open-air movie at the water's edge. There is a
dialog: funny scene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOYS
dialog: All seats are sold out! Free entrance
dialog: and payment on the way out!! Sssssh!!
dialog: 
text: And they guffaw noisily. Their laughter is echoed by more
text: laughter, in the distance...
dialog: 
text: ...the laughter of the Arena audience, scattered among the
text: metal chairs. By dint of laughing, the people in one of the rows
text: of chairs tip over backwards. Screams, laughs, whistles.
text: The projection booth has a door at the back with stairs leading
text: down to the rocks. SALVATORE is sitting on the ground, bare
text: chested, tired and sticky with sweat. He is reading a letter from
text: ELENA. He is so engrossed the words can almost be read on his
dialog: face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA'S VOICE
dialog: (Off-screen)
dialog: Salvatore, my darling, here the days
dialog: never end. I find your name
dialog: everywhere if I read a book, do a
text: crossword puzzle, thumb through a
dialog: newspaper...You're always before my
dialog: eyes. Today I've got some rather bad
dialog: news. At the end of October we're
dialog: moving to the city where I'll attend
dialog: the University. It'll be hard to see
dialog: each other every day. But don't
dialog: worry, whenever I can get away I'll
dialog: always come running to you, to the
dialog: Cinema Paradiso.
dialog: 
text: On the Arena screen, with its potted plants and palm trees, a
text: very funny scene is being shown. The audience again bursts into
text: wild laughter. And the audience of LITTLE BOYS in the boats also laugh. One
text: of them, laughing himself to tears, loses his balance and falls
text: into the water. The others howl with laughter. A voice rises up
text: out of the carousel of boats.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: URCHIN
dialog: Fuck me! I've caught an octopus! An

speaker_heading: FADE
dialog: 
scene_heading: 75 VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The August sun is blazing hot. People are forced to stay inside when the sirocco
text: blows. The streets are empty. And there is a strange silence. Nothing can be
text: heard except far in the distance, from somewhere in the country, the love song
text: of some carter...SALVATORE hears it too, stretched out on the floor of his
text: room, his eyes fixed on the ceiling where flies buzz around nervously. The
text: MAILMAN comes down the street on his bicycle, rides up to SALVATORE and hands
text: him a letter...Sitting in the shade of a white wall, SALVATORE reads the
text: letter. Next to him, the dog that kept him company at night, beneath ELENA's
text: window. He gazes up at him as if looking for news of her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 76:ARENA IMPERIA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT.EVENING
dialog: 
text: The Arena is crowded with sun-burnt faces. On screen, scenes from
text: Ulysses. On a shelf in the projection booth, there is an enormous pack of
text: letters. SALVATORE is worn out. The waiting has destroyed him. He looks
text: like a madman. As he winds up one of the parts of the film, he repeats
text: her name obsessively, under his breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Elena...Elena...Elena...
dialog: 
text: Now he is sitting outside on the back steps, a few yards from the
text: sea. There is a breeze this evening, the waves are rather high and
text: the boats of 'gate-crashers' can be seen out in the water, rolling
text: fitfully but not dangerously. SALVATORE stretches out, gazes up
text: at the inky sky and talks to himself, just like a madman,
dialog: whispering...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: When will this shitty summer be over?
dialog: (Half shutting his eyes)
dialog: In a film it'd already be finished...
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: ...Fade-out and cut to a nice
dialog: thunderstorm!!! Huh? that'd be
dialog: perfect!
dialog: 
text: A clap of thunder explodes in the air. Loud, rumbling. SALVATORE'S eyes pop
text: open. The Arena audience looks up in alarm at the sky...The 'gate-crashers' in
text: the boats also look up and see a streak of lightning ushering in another clap of
text: thunder. One of those storms is building up that ruins late summer
text: nights. SALVATORE gives a contented smile as the cloudburst pours down
text: violently, suddenly... The Arena audience scatters with a howl and scurries
text: over to the overhanging roofs of the projection booth, to take shelter and to go
text: on watching the film despite the rain...
dialog: 
text: The LITTLE BOYS in the boats quickly pull tarpaulins over their
text: heads...But SALVATORE does not get up. He lets the rain fall on him,
text: goes on laughing, incredulous and stunned as if a real miracle had
text: taken place. And as he shuts his eyes and lifts his head up, to
text: catch more rain on his face, and gives himself up to that marvellous feeling of
text: joy, a mouth comes to rest passionately on his lips it is ELENA. SALVATORE opens
text: his eyes in utter amazement, it seems like a vision, another hallucination
dialog: created by the rain...Instead no, it is really her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Elena!...But when...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I got back today. You can't imagine
dialog: the excuses I had to make up to be
dialog: here...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE's lips interrupt her. It is an intense, a stupendous kiss. They've
text: probably never been so happy as they are at that moment. They cling to each
text: other as the rain goes on streaming over their bodies, mingling her hair with
text: his, binding them ever closer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 77 CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: Autumn has arrived. In the streets, the PEASANTS prepare the barrels
text: for preserving the grape must. ALFREDO is sitting in front of the Cinema
text: Paradiso with SPACCAFICO and the USHER. It is a quiet moment, they chat, while
text: the humming of the projector and the sound track of the film can be heard
text: through the window of the booth. The MAILMAN stops and hands SPACCAFICO a folded
dialog: sheet of paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAILMAN
dialog: Don Ciccio, this is for Toto. Give it
dialog: him...
dialog: (And he pedals off on his
dialog: bicycle.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
text: SPACCAFICO unfolds it, reads it, claps his hands on his head, in alarm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: Holy blood of Judas! Now what am I
dialog: going to do??!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 78 UNIVERSITY. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: ELENA is waiting near the University. She paces nervously back and
text: forth. Glances at her watch. He's late. She looks around in all
text: directions and sees him at last. He comes running up to her. They
dialog: embrace...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: So what'd they say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: The army says that, as a war orphan,
dialog: I don't have to serve in the
dialog: military, but nothing can be done.
dialog: It's a bureaucratic error. I have to
text: leave. Day after tomorrow morning.
dialog: They're sending me to Rome. But
dialog: they'll discharge me ten days later.
dialog: Let's go...
dialog: 
text: He takes her hand, turns to go to a café. ELENA holds back. She has caught sight
text: of her FATHER's car approaching. ELENA turns to look and in a faint voice
text: reveals the reason for her nervousness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's
dialog: my father.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Good, this way we can finally talk.
dialog: I'll convince him this time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He
dialog: has other plans for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
text: The son of one of his colleagues.
dialog: Don't act that way. We'll talk about
dialog: it later. Wait for me Thursday at the
dialog: Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with
text: the five o'clock bus.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE looks with longing as ELENA drives away with her father.
text: ELENA gives him a meaningful look through the window. SALVATORE returns the
text: look, but stands there motionless, with a grim expression, like someone who
text: knows how to take the treacherous blows of life. The car drives off and with it
text: ELENA. Their eyes hang on the same thread. The thread of hope and now of fear.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 79 CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING
dialog: 
text: The poster of Il Grido hangs on the billboard outside the theatre.
text: SPACCAFICO replaces 'THURSDAY' with a 'TODAY' sticker. The
text: CHARWOMAN is washing the floor of the lobby. SPACCAFICO shouts
text: up to SALVATORE, who is in the projectionist's booth. SPACCAFICIO
dialog: says that tomorrow he'll be leaving and today is his last day on the job,
dialog: and he's sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: Toto, this is no film for the common
dialog: herd. One day'll be more than
dialog: enough...So tonight, please set up
dialog: tomorrow's film, so the projectionist
dialog: who is coming will find it ready.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: OK...
dialog: 
text: SPACCAFICO understands SALVATORE's sadness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: Cheer up, Toto. I'll be here waiting
dialog: for you. No one's taking your job
dialog: away from you. Don't worry!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 80 SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The bus has pulled into the square but among the people getting out
text: there is no sign of ELENA. SALVATORE stands nervously up in the window of the
text: projection booth, glances at his watch. It's already five-thirty and she hasn't
text: come. He checks the projector. The first part has just begun and the reel is
text: full of film.
dialog: 
text: The first part is now about to finish, the reel is almost empty, and ELENA still
text: isn't there. SALVATORE is extremely nervous, worried, mortified by his meeting
text: with her FATHER.
text: He sees ELENA's face pulling away in the car. Thinks back over her
text: terrible confession. He paces back and forth, as if he were in a prison cell,
text: thinking up solutions...The stair light finally goes on; there she is SALVATORE
text: dashes over and down the stairs to meet her. He comes down the final turn of the
text: spiral staircase and finds himself face to face with ALFREDO, who is slowly
text: making his way up with the help of his cane. SALVATORE freezes to the spot.
text: ALFREDO senses his disappointment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: You weren't expecting me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Nervously)
dialog: No, Alfredo, I was coming to help
dialog: you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: You were expecting her? Huh?
text: (SALVATORE doesn't answer.
dialog: He's too worried, too
text: upset. ALFREDO climbs
dialog: another step, whispering.)
dialog: ...It's a nasty business waiting by
dialog: yourself. In company it's better.
dialog: No?...Then I'll leave.
dialog: 
text: As usual ALFREDO'S sweetness comforts SALVATORE, indeed suddenly gives him a
text: bold idea, one that quiets his nervousness. He puts a hand on ALFREDO'S
dialog: shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Alfredo, I need your help!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 8I ROAD TO THE CITY. EXT. AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The Balilla speeds as fast as it can down the road to the city, where ELENA s
text: family has gone to live. SALVATORE drives along in a state of agitation. The
text: idea of having to leave without seeing ELENA is his obsession. An obsession he
dialog: refuses to accept...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 82 CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The second part has begun, the reel is full. For the first time in many
text: years, ALFREDO is alone in the booth, sitting in front of the projector,
text: and he feels helpless. Not only because he's blind, but also because
text: there is nothing he can do for SALVATORE. A strange agitation comes over him, as
dialog: if he were experiencing the same anxiety troubling his 'Toto' at that moment.
text: Meanwhile, the film roll on and with it, time, minutes...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 83 CITY.EXT.AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE has already reached the city. He slows down at the bus
text: terminus. Looks at the people waiting, but she is not there...
text: He asks several girls in front of the University. But they haven't seen
dialog: her...
dialog: 
text: He phones from a phone booth. But nobody answers. His self-control
text: is about to give way to desperation...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 84 CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: On the reel there is less film. Like an hourglass with the sand trickling
dialog: through...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 85:ELENAS HOUSE IN THE CITY.EXT/INT.AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE comes streaking up in front of her house. He screeches to a stop,
text: dashes out like greased lightning. His nerves are tense, a slight tremor runs
text: through his whole body. He rings the bell, but nobody answers. A MAN who lives
text: in the building opens the front door and comes out.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE seizes the chance and climbs up to the third floor. He pounds on the
text: door furiously, almost cracking his knuckles. But all to no avail; there is
text: nobody at home. He shrieks, panic stricken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Open up! Open up! Elenaaa!
dialog: 
text: And in fact, there is somebody inside: ELENA's MOTHER. She sits there immobile,
dialog: without a word.
dialog: 
text: The pounding on the door reverberates in the room, but she does not budge,
text: determined to ignore that desperate message.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 86:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The reel spins faster. The film is almost ended. By now there is very
dialog: little time...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 87 ROAD TO THE VILLAGE. EXT. SUNDOWN
dialog: 
text: And SALVATORE is on his way home, defeated. Be drives as fast as he can. Be is
text: in a terrible state, can't figure out what's happened. Can't explain it. And
dialog: that's what hurts.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 88 CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. SUNDOWN
dialog: 
text: The words 'THE END' appear on the screen...and the film runs out, leaving the
text: projector turning uselessly. ALFREDO is alarmed. He can hear that the film is
text: finished, but doesn't know where to begin. He gropes around. He's scared. Like a
text: little boy calls his mother when he's lost in a crowd, so old ALFREDO calls
text: SALVATORE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: TotooooO! TotooooO!
dialog: 
text: The few people down in the audience start whistling and complaining about the
dialog: film they haven't understood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPECTATORS
dialog: Lights! Christ, what a piece of
dialog: crap!! We want OUT money back!!!
dialog: Heeeeey!! Bandits!!

dialog: 
scene_heading: 90 CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. SUNDOWN
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE turns the lights on in the theatre and turns off the projector, trying
text: to calm down ALFREDO, who has got to his feet, frightened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: But where'd you go, Toto?!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!
dialog: (And he folds him into his
dialog: arms, like calming down a
dialog: little boy who has had a
dialog: nightmare. Be whispers,
dialog: still out of breath:)
dialog: Sit down, sit down...
speaker_heading: (ALFREDO quiets down as
text: SALVATORE lowers him into
text: a chair, and asks him the
dialog: only question upon which
dialog: his last hope depends.)
dialog: Did she come?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: No, nobody came.
dialog: (And he embraces him,
dialog: almost as if to comfort
dialog: him in his great
dialog: disappointment.)
dialog: 
dialog: For SALVATORE it's really the end: she's not coming. Tomorrow he'll be leaving
text: without having seen her again.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE'S hands remove the photographs of Amedeo Nazzari and of ELENA from the
text: wall, slip them into one of his pockets.
dialog: 
text: Now the hands open the metal containers of tomorrow's film, take .
text: out the reels to set them up, pick up the receipt - his last before leaving -
text: and with the same mechanical gesture, hang it on a nail, as usual.

scene_heading: 91 ROME. VARIOUS SETTINGS, MILITARY LIFE. EXT/ INT. DAY/NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Radio Operator Di Vita Salvatore!
dialog: Third Battalion, Ninth Company,
dialog: sir!!!
dialog:

dialog: 
text: A SECOND LIEUTENANT barks out a march rhythm in the blazing sun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECOND LIEUTENANT
dialog: One, two, one, two!! Attention! Left
dialog: march!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE sneaks out of line, goes over and slips a letter into
text: the mailbox and hurries back to his place.
dialog: 
text: On one of the public phones in a square of Rome, SALVATORE is phoning ELENA.
text: Nobody answers. He slams down the receiver, as the line of SOLDIERS waits its
dialog: turn...
dialog: 
text: Night-time. A large plastic bag full of water. A thud. SALVATORE wakes up with a
text: start in a lake of ice water. He lets out a terrified shriek as the others
text: laugh, protected by the dark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Aaaaaaah! Heeeeeelp!!
dialog: 
text: In the large dormitory, the SERGEANT is handing out the mail. He
text: throws a pile of letters on SALVATORE'S bunk. They are his letters to ELENA,
text: stamped 'ADDRESS UNKNOWN'.
dialog: 
text: Mess duty. SALVATORE is washing Up, in a sea of water and grease.
text: He rimes a pan full of tomato sauce with a tap hose. A spurt of red water
text: splatters him in the face.
dialog: 
text: A training run. Another letter which SALVATORE drops into the mailbox...
dialog: 
text: A cold, rainy night. SALVATORE stands stiff as a poker in front of the
text: Ammunition depot. It is his first guard duty. Soaked to the skin, gazing wide-
text: eyed into empty space.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLONEL'S office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Aggressively)
dialog: Colonel, I was supposed to spend ten
dialog: days here and it's been about a year,
dialog: and I haven't ever gone borne. I'd
dialog: like a furlough, at least!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is in the guardhouse. A cold, dark, filthy cell. His nerves start to
text: give way. He bows his head in despair.
dialog: 
text: Hospital. SALVATORE is exhausted, run-down. The night-stand is jammed with
text: medicines. He lies in bed without moving, staring off into empty space, and
text: repeats obsessively in a low voice, as if talking to himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Elena...Elena...Elena...
dialog: (He has touched the
dialog: extreme of suffering, a
dialog: young man who has
dialog: been denied love and
dialog: affection, his rights,
dialog: freedom. A NURSE comes
dialog: up.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Di Vita Salvatore, get ready, your
text: discharge has come through.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE registers this information with his eyes and nods absently.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 92 GIANCALDO. SQUARE AND STREETS. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The bus disappears around the corner leaving SALVATORE standing there alone. It
text: is a blazing hot day. The sirocco wind blows the yellow dust in all directions.
text: The square is empty, the billboard in front of the closed movie house announces
text: a Western. SALVATORE puts his suitcase on the ground, looks around. Everything
text: exactly the same, immobile. Only one new feature in the cafe there's a jukebox
dialog: playing 'Estate' sung by Milva.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE turns towards the Cinema Paradiso. The projectionist is at the
text: window of the booth, smoking a cigarette. Who knows who he is, where he came
text: from. A hot flurry of dust. SALVATORE turns and sees a dog leaping around kim,
text: wagging its tail. It's the dog that kept him company during his nights beneath
text: the window. SALVATORE gives a start of joy, drops his suitcase and leans over to
text: stroke him. Then he hugs him, as if he were an old friend.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 93 ALFREDO'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE goes to see ALFREDO. He is still in bed, has just woken up. He is glad
text: to hear his 'Toto'. He feels his forehead, his eyes and cheeks, as if to 'see'
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: You 're thinner...You can tell
dialog: you've not been treated well.
dialog: (As usual, you can't hide
speaker_heading: anything from ALFREDO.
dialog: SALVATORE senses something
dialog: different in him that he
dialog: can't figure out, like
dialog: same wild restlessness
dialog: within).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: They tell me you never go out, never
dialog: talk to anybody. Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Toto, sooner or later there comes a
dialog: time when talking or keeping quiet is
dialog: the same thing. So it's better to
dialog: shut up.
dialog: (Changing his lone)
dialog: It's hot in here. Toto, take me to
dialog: the beach.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 94 BEACH AND WATERFRONT. EXT. AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The sea is ruffled and the air is less sultry, easier to breathe.
text: SALVATORE and ALFREDO walk slowly along the waterfront. ALFREDO totters
text: slightly, holds on to SALVATORE, who is telling him something very funny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: At the Christmas party the lieutenant
text: pinches a girl's ass. The girl turns
dialog: around: it's the daughter of the
text: commanding officer. The lieutenant is
dialog: scared to death and says: 'Miss, if
dialog: your heart is as hard as what I have
dialog: just touched, I'm done for!
dialog: 
text: And they roar with laughter. They look like two old school buddies telling each
text: other dirty jokes. They stop beside a low wall. ALFREDO knows that those laughs
text: are simply a way of uselessly dancing around the countless things that are
text: troubling SALVATORE. And he breaks the ice, while SALVATORE is still
dialog: laughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: (Seriously)
dialog: Did you ever see her again?
dialog: (SALVATORE'S laughter dies
text: away, taken off-guard as
text: he is. Then he lights a
dialog: cigarette.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: No. And nobody knows where she is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: It was probably meant to be like
dialog: this. Each of us has a star to
dialog: follow. So now what are you thinking
dialog: of doing?
dialog: 
dialog: It's a terrible question, and SALVATORE has no answer to it. In fact, would
text: rather not even talk about it. He changes his tone, as if he hadn't heard it,
text: laughs, trying again to ding to the funny jokes he heard during military
dialog: service.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Listen to this one...The commander
dialog: says to the sergeant: 'You
dialog: remember that windmill that used to
dialog: be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the
dialog: mill's gone but the wind's still
dialog: there!'
dialog: (And he bursts into
dialog: nervous laughter. But this
dialog: time ALFREDO remains cold,
dialog: unmoved, does not laugh
text: with him. SALVATORE
text: gradually falls silent. He
dialog: doesn't know what to say.
dialog: For the first time in his
dialog: life, he doesn't know what
dialog: goal to aim for, doesn't
dialog: know what to do. The cloud
dialog: of smoke wreaths his
text: nervous face, now he seems
dialog: to relax, whispers:)
dialog: You remember the story of the soldier
dialog: and the princess?
text: (ALFREDO nods his head.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Now I understand why the soldier went
dialog: away just before the end. That's
dialog: right, just one more night and the
dialog: princess would have been his. But
dialog: she, also, could not have kept her
dialog: promise. And...that would have been
dialog: terrible, he would have died from it.
dialog: So instead, for ninety-nine nights at
dialog: least he had lived with the illusion
dialog: that she was there waiting for him...
dialog: (This time SALVATORE is
dialog: the one to explain
dialog: something to ALFREDO. And
text: ALFREDO realizes how
dialog: bitter his story is and,
dialog: above all, that the boy
dialog: standing there is no
dialog: longer a boy...)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away!
dialog: This land is cursed.
dialog: (They are now leaning
dialog: against a boat on the
text: beach. ALFREDO goes on
dialog: whispering his words.)
dialog: When you're here every day you feel
dialog: like you're at the center
dialog: of the universe, it seems like
dialog: nothing ever changes. Then you go
dialog: away, one year, two...And when you
dialog: come back, everything's different.
dialog: The thread has broken. You don't
dialog: find those you were looking for, your
dialog: things no longer exist. Isn't that
dialog: the case?...You've got to go away a
dialog: long time, for many, many years,
dialog: before coming back and finding your
dialog: people again, the land where
dialog: you were born...But not now, it's
dialog: impossible. Now you're blinder than I
dialog: am.
dialog: (Intense words, straight
dialog: from the heart, and
text: SALVATORE is spellbound.
text: He whispers with a smile:)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Who said that? Gary Cooper, James
dialog: Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
speaker_heading: (ALFREDO also gives a
dialog: gentle smile)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it!
dialog: Life's not like you saw it in the
dialog: movies. Life...is harder.
text: (He lays his hand on
text: SALVATORE'S shoulder,
dialog: gives it a hard squeeze.)
dialog: Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're
dialog: young, the world is yours! And I'm
dialog: old...I don't want to hear you talk
dialog: any more, I want to hear talk about
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE gives a shudder that runs through his very soul. The setting sun lies
text: colorless on the horizon.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 95 VARIOUS SETTINGS. EXT/INT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Night. The square is empty. SALVATORE is sitting on the church steps.
text: His head in his hands. He has to make a decision leave or stay. And why?...
dialog: 'What decision will he make?' is the question that keeps ALFREDO awake, in his
dialog: hot dark bedroom...
dialog: 
text: MARIA, his mother, also can't get to sleep. She knows, senses, that her son is
dialog: on the verge of an important turning-point. But what will he decide? What will
dialog: happen?...
dialog: 
text: Also LIA, his sister, feels a strange, heavy tension in the air. And
text: doesn't sleep. She's probably wondering where SALVATORE is at that
dialog: hour...
dialog: 
text: He's sitting on the ground. But even if he were to go to bed he wouldn't
text: sleep. He rubs his face with his hand. The church bell chimes four a.m...
dialog: 
text: ALMOST THIRTY YEARS LATER, another distant bell is chiming four a.m. And
text: SALVATORE is once again wide awake. He is thinking, with his hand on his face,
text: just like then. And the same decision to make: what to do? Stretched out beside
text: a sleeping WOMAN, he goes on staring at the window. Outside, the storm has
text: passed. The long memory has almost faded, only the sound of a train surfaces in
dialog: his mind...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 96 GIANCALDO RAILWAY STATION. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: It's the train that THIRTY YEARS EARLIER had pulled into the station
text: of his home town before leaving for Rome. SALVATORE hugs his
text: MOTHER and SISTER. The moment has come to say goodbye to
text: ALFREDO. The old man is deeply moved. A heart-rending trembling
text: comes into his husky voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Don't come back any more, don't think
dialog: about us, don't turn round, don't
dialog: write, don't give in to nostalgia.
dialog: Forget us all. If you can't hear it
dialog: and come back, don't come looking for
dialog: me, I won't let you into the house,
dialog: you understand?
dialog: 
text: They clasp each other tightly, as if they knew they wouldn't be meeting
dialog: again...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Thanks for all you've done for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Whatever you do, love it like you
dialog: loved that projection booth of the
dialog: Paradiso when you were little...
text: (The train moves now.
text: Hands wave in the air,
dialog: drawing further and
text: further away. The PRIEST
dialog: has arrived at the last
dialog: moment and waves goodbye
dialog: from the distance.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: (Shouting)
dialog: Goodbye, TotooooooO!!! I got here too
dialog: late. What a shame!
dialog: 
text: The figure of ALFREDO and the others can no longer be distinguished. Only a
text: distant blur at the end of the track.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 97 PUNTA RAISI AIRPORT. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: THIRTY YEARS LATER, a plane flies over Sicily. It lands on the
text: runway char seems to emerge from the sea and flatten out towards the slopes of
text: the dark mountains. Salvatore's face appears among the clouds reflected in one
text: of the plane windows. He has the tense look of the man who suddenly comes home
text: after the adventure of life has carried him afar, wandering the world, where he
text: has forgotten everything. From the plane window to another window...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 98 SUPERHIGHWAY. INT/EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: ...the window of the taxi-cab driving SALVATORE to his home town. The scenery
text: moving by on either side of the road summons up sweet memories. A lot of things
text: have changed, but the colors are still the same. The yellow running through the
text: entire landscape is unmistakable. And all those black birds perched in a row on
text: the guard-rail are crows.
dialog: 
text: The cab now approaches the outskirts of Giancaldo. But if the sign,
dialog: hadn't been there with the name on it, it could be an entirely different
dialog: place...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 99 SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The house where SALVATORE'S MOTHER lives is also new, nearer the
dialog: sea.
dialog: 
text: The old lady is sitting alone in an armchair in the parlor, knitting a white
text: sweater. Her hands move very swiftly, almost mechanically.
dialog: 
text: The hands of a woman who is waiting. The front doorbell rings twice. MARIA stops
text: short. That is what she has been waiting for. She mumbles in excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: It's Toto...I knew it...
dialog: 
text: And she scrambles to her feet, dropping her knitting in the chair, one needle
text: dangling over the edge. She hurries off, forgetting that she still has the ball
text: of white yarn in her apron pocket. And the yarn runs off the needles and the
text: knitting comes undone quickly as she moves about the house, goes down the stairs
text: to the front door.
dialog: 
text: There the yam stops and MARIA' s excited voice is heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA 'S VOICE
dialog: (Off-screen)
dialog: Toto!...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE'S VOICE (Off-screen)
dialog: How are you, Mamma?...
dialog: 
text: The camera now moves, discovering them through the parlor window, hugging each
text: other outside the front door. Under the curious eyes of an old bored dog.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 100 SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: MARIA is no longer wearing an apron. Mother and son are sitting side
text: by side at the kitchen table...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll
dialog: see. And you won't recognize the
dialog: kids any more, they're grown up by
dialog: now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: They're always writing to me saying
dialog: they want to come to Rome!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE looks around; It's a place he's never seen before, and yet it's
dialog: his mother's house.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: See how pretty the house is? We did
dialog: everything over.
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: If it hadn't been for you!
dialog: (Getting up)
dialog: Come, I have a surprise....
text: (She takes him by the hand
text: and leads him out to the
text: hallway. SALVATORE looks
text: at her and feels a pang.
dialog: She seems smaller, age
dialog: withers the body, she is
text: slightly stooped, her hair
text: is gathered into a knot at
dialog: the back other head.)
dialog: You must be tired. If you want to
dialog: rest, there's time before the
dialog: funeral.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Interrupting her)
dialog: No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by
dialog: air, you know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (Smiling, ironically)
dialog: You shouldn't tell me that now. After
dialog: all these years!
dialog: (SALVATORE gets the
dialog: message, feels guilty.
dialog: Thinking about it, it
dialog: seems incredible that he
dialog: has never come before.
text: MARIA opens a door, steps
dialog: aside to let her son in,
dialog: whispers:)
dialog: I put all your things in here. Go in,
dialog: go in...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE lakes a few steps, is flabbergasted at the sight of his old room
text: perfectly reconstructed and preserved. It looks like a museum, the museum of the
text: past. Despite the bed, the clothes in the cupboard, the books on the shelves, it
dialog: is perfectly clear that no one has ever lived in it and never will live in it.
text: MARIA senses his perturbation, remains standing in the doorway as if to leave
text: him alone...SALVATORE goes over to the bed, looks around the old 8mm movie
text: camera, the projector, his documentaries, the bicycle hanging on the wall, the
text: photographs of his favorite movie stars. But what mostly catches his eye is a
text: tiny framed photograph: SALVATORE as a little boy and ALFREDO, standing smiling
text: in front of the Cinema Paradiso. Strange, at that time ALFREDO was younger than
text: he is now! It's as if he were standing there before him one last time. That
text: impressive figure, his good-natured bur firm look, touches his heart. From
text: ALFREDO'S smiling face to...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 101 GIANCALDO. MAIN STREET AND SQUARE. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: ...the coffin where his old blind friend rests for ever. The funeral
text: procession winds its way down the main street. At the intersections, ,
text: cars stop to let the black hearse pass by. People cross themselves. The old men
text: remove their hats. Store shutters are lowered. Then, when the procession has
text: passed by, the cars start up again, the old men put their hats back on, the
text: shutters are pulled up.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is in the front row with his MOTHER, next to ALFREDO'S WIDOW.
text: SIGNORA ANNA says in a whisper, her eyes fixed on the coffin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: He would have been happy you came,
dialog: Toto. He always talked about you.
dialog: Always! Right to the end! He was
dialog: terribly fond of you...
dialog: (Tears come to her, she is
dialog: unable to say any more.
text: SALVATORE gives her a hug,
dialog: deeply touched by her
dialog: words.)
dialog: He left two things for you. Come see
dialog: me before you leave.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE nods his head. He gazes intensely at the coffin covered with flowers
text: and is grieved as if he were ashamed never to have come to see the man who had
text: been like a father to him. But why had he forgotten him? Up in front, leading
text: the procession, he sees a young PRIEST with an altar boy beside him, and these
text: figures are also like chisels scraping the rust off his soul and bringing old
dialog: feelings to light again.
dialog: 
text: The procession reaches the square. The dark column stands etched in the dazzling
text: early-afternoon light. SIGNORA ANNA motions the driver and the procession comes
text: to a halt. It is ALFREDO'S last farewell to the place where he had spent the
text: best years of his life the Cinema Paradiso. Everyone turns to look and
text: SALVATORE also turns, taken by surprise...It has fallen to pieces: doors and
text: windows boarded shut, crumbling walls, a piece of the sign dangling down, weeds
text: and mildew in the cracks and on the roof. The square has changed completely, is
text: unrecognizable. Buildings, stores, sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a
text: snail's pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns. And the central square has
text: turned motorcycles. SALVATORE turns slowly to look behind him, towards the small
text: crowd, and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at
text: once, despite the many years that have gone by: the MAN AT THE BOX OFFICE, the
text: USHER who also served as bill-poster, the CHARWOMAN, the CARABINIERE SERGEANT,
text: and further on behind ROSA and ANGELO, the lovebirds who had met in the movie
dialog: house and then got married. They all have white hair. And they too have
text: recognized him, give little hello nods and gestures. Another face
text: he seems to recognize: why sure, it's SPACCAFICO, the owner. How old he's
text: become! He also looks up and his eyes meet SALVATORE'S. A hello nod.
text: SALVATORE makes his way over to him through the crowd. They shake hands
text: heartily, without a word, both touched. The procession starts up again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Under his breath)
dialog: How long's it been shut?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: Six years ago this May. No one came
dialog: any more. You "know better than me,
dialog: Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television,
dialog: videos. By now the movie business is
dialog: only a dream. The city's bought it
dialog: now to make a new parking lot. Next
dialog: Saturday they're
dialog: tearing it down...A pity!...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is disconcerted, irritated by that 'Mr. Di Vita'. Besides, finding
text: out that the movie house is to be torn down depresses him, after all, it's a
text: piece of his life...And all those curious faces staring at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'?
dialog: It didn't used to be that way...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: Well, it's hard to call an important
dialog: person by his first name. But if it
dialog: really matters to you, I'11 call
dialog: you...
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Toto!...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE smiles at that. Meanwhile, the procession has reached the church.
text: SALVATORE excuses himself and goes over to the hearse. Old SPACCAFICO watches
text: him go, then says, almost to himself)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPACCAFICO
dialog: Bless you, Toto.
dialog: 
text: The coffin is unloaded. SALVATORE has asked to be one of the
text: bearers into the church. As he moves off slowly with that weight
text: on his shoulder, somebody catches his eye on the other side of the sidewalk. An
text: old woman, sixty or seventy years old, with a plastic bag in her hand. She
text: crosses herself quickly. SALVATORE recognizes her she was the one he made love
text: with for the first time. TERESA, the prostitute. The coffin is carried into the
text: church, followed by the little procession.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 102 SALVATORE' S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The little house is sunk in the darkness of evening and the ground floor
text: windows are lit up. The rustling of the sea can be heard. The family is having
text: supper. The table is set with the finest silver and the company china has been
text: brought out. LIA is also there with her husband, ALFIO, and their two children.
text: FILIPPO, fifteen, and SARA, thirteen. The television is on, but the sound has
text: been turned practically all the way down. SALVATORE'S presence arouses a special
text: excitement. The children look at their uncle with a certain awe, after all they
dialog: don't really know him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: (Playfully)
dialog: Uncle, the next time Granny comes to
dialog: Rome, I want to come along too. I
dialog: want to see what you do when you
dialog: work...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: Fine. But I warn you, there isn't
dialog: much to see. I sell much more smoke
dialog: than fire...
dialog: 
text: The CHILDREN laugh. At the sight of them, LIA, ALFIO and MARIA also smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALFIO
dialog: (To SALVATORE)
dialog: Watch out, don't get too familiar
dialog: with those two
dialog: (indicating the children)
dialog: they're worse than cannibals. They'll
dialog: take advantage.
dialog: 
text: Everybody laughs again. Even MARIA laughs a lot. SALVATORE looks at her; he had
dialog: never seen her laugh like that, amused, at peace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FILIPPO
dialog: You leaving tomorrow, Uncle?
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE doesn't know what to say. He feels drunk. It has been a day of violent
text: upheavals, a series of almost overwhelming emotions and now he knows nothing on
dialog: the one hand, he' d like to stay, let himself drift on the sweet tide of family
text: life, be completely carried off by the rolling waves of his own past: on the
text: other, he wishes he had never come. He forces himself to smile again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I don't know, Filippo. I don't
dialog: know...
dialog: 
text: They go on eating, but SALVATORE isn't very hungry. Re peers at LIA eating out
text: of the comer of his eye, feels deeply bound to her she has a few white hairs
text: and light wrinkles line her face.
dialog: 
text: Then he looks at her husband, ALFIO, he's going bald but he tries to hide it by
text: combing over the little hair left. Who knows what their marriage is like, he
text: wonders. He looks back at LIA, and it's as if she sensed it, she looks up,
text: guesses the nature of his thoughts, imagines what he is trying to figure out, a
text: blush colors her cheeks and she smiles. SALVATORE returns a conniving smile.
text: The ringing of a phone. SARA starts to get up to go and answer it, hut MARIA
text: stops her with a glance of the eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (To SALVATORE)
dialog: It must be for you...They've been
dialog: calling all afternoon. They wanted to
dialog: know if you're leaving this evening
dialog: or tomorrow...
dialog: 
text: Everyone turns to SALVATORE with questioning looks, making him feel even more
text: restless and undecided. The phone goes on ringing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 103 CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY .
dialog: 
text: The TRAFFIC cops are trying to break the front door down with their
text: shoulders. Once, twice, and at last, the door flies open with a screech,
text: kicking up a cloud of dust. SALVATORE enters by himself...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 104 CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE'S silhouette stands out against the light in the open door. S lowly he
text: makes his way into the empty theatre. A thick layer of dust lends everything a
text: gray, rarefied look. The light streaming in from the windows up above teems with
text: strange mates of dust, like a haze.
dialog: 
text: Cobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling. SALVATORE walks down the middle
text: aisle. The rows of seats are unhinged, what was once the wooden veneer has
text: warped from the dampness. He looks around as if he Were thumbing through the
dialog: album of his memories.
dialog: 
text: The screen dangles from its frame. The emergency exits are boarded
text: and nailed shut. Observing the emptiness of the theatre, SALVATORE
text: has the feeling he can hear the howling, the whistling and voices of the .
text: audience, as he remembers it. But only for one brief moment, then the silence
text: returns. A mouse creeps along one wall, stops near a pile of dust. SALVATORE is
text: attracted by that little gray mass. He goes over as the mouse scampers off,
text: takes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lion's head covered with
text: dust. He moves it with his foot, then looks up at the projection booth,
text: repeating the same gesture of bygone years. But the lion's head is no longer
text: there, only the outline of it on the wall, and cobwebs have covered the hales of
dialog: the booth, those little square openings that had caused him such long suffering
text: as a little boy...SALVATORE now climbs up the spiral staircase. Each step kicks
text: up a little cloud of dust.
dialog: 
text: The little booth, yellow with fumes, appears before him again. Now it
text: looks like some big, empty cave. The projector is no longer there, nor
text: the equipment. Who knows where they junked them?! The only thing left is a clump
text: of film strips still attached to the wall: trailers, Part One
text: endings, etc...There he had kissed ELENA for the first time, and
text: strips of film like those had grazed their faces. Now they are caught up
text: in the coils of cobwebs. And where the film-winder once stood, the
text: nails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts. Of all the films
text: shown at the Cinema Paradiso Palace. And three more boxfuls of
text: them are on the floor.
dialog: 
text: And the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass
text: broken. SALVATORE peers out of one of the cracks in the window and
text: sees the village...which is now a city. A different world he no longer
dialog: knows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 105 CAFÉ IN SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The cafe in the square has been completely renovated. The CASHIER and BARMEN
text: have young, unfamiliar faces. SALVATORE holds out the receipt with a tip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: A double whisky, please.
dialog: 
text: Several BOYS are sitting at the comer tables, talking about girls. Others stand
text: playing 'war games', shake around to the obsessive strains of same electronic
dialog: tune.
dialog: 
text: A man comes up to SALVATORE and asks for his autograph. Then SALVATORE turns to
text: the plate-glass window overlooking the main street, where the workers' club once
text: was. And like a flash, a shudder freezes him to the spot.... Two steps away
dialog: from
text: him, through the glass, a stunning vision, which casts him beyond time, chills
text: his blood: there before him is ELENA! But she is still young, young as she was
text: then! Sweet, luminous, alluring, exactly the way he saw her the first time at
dialog: the station.
dialog: 
text: She is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her
dialog: arm...Have the passing years had no effect on her? Or is she an hallucination?
text: No! It's a dream! Or is he dead too, like ALFREDO? SALVATORE doesn't know how to
text: explain it. And he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic. His glass drops to
text: the floor...As the GIRL walks off...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 106 GIANCALDO. STREET. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: At the age of fifty-five, SALVATORE feels no scruples about wandering
text: the streets of his home town, spying from a distance on an eighteen- year-old
text: girl. There's nothing he can do about it. He stares at her with the amazement of
text: someone who discovers that miracles exist. Now he is nearer to her. How lovely
dialog: she is! It's her, no doubt about it! Exactly the same. Except she has a
text: different hair-do and is wearing different clothes: ELENA didn't wear slacks.
text: The GIRL goes up to a parked motorcycle. She removes the padlock and fastens her
text: books to the rack. SALVATORE is standing there a few steps away, and without
text: stopping to think, moves a little closer, discreetly, politely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Excuse me, Miss...
text: (She turns to look at him,
text: indifferent, but friendly.
text: He looks at her wonderful
dialog: blue eyes.)
dialog: I'm so sorry, I thought you were
dialog: someone else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (Shrugging)
dialog: Well.
dialog: 
text: She has already started the motor of her bike. A flip of the accelerator and
text: off she goes, her hair flying in the wind.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE follows her with his eyes until she disappears around the corner.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 107 SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The old shots of ELENA getting off the train and walking away, casting a curious
text: look at the camera...SALVATORE is watching her again, projected on the white
text: wall of his room. He also watches the other shots of those happy long-gone days
text: the picnic,. she at the beach, smiling, joyful...And again SALVATORE doesn't
dialog: understand, or doesn't want to understand. But these scenes could have been shot
text: yesterday, so identical to ELENA is the girl he saw on the street...And the
text: wound which he thought had healed years ago, starts bleeding again.
dialog: 
text: The lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever
text: knowing why, and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his
text: young mind, start slipping through his soul again, like those shots
text: slipping again through an old 8mm projector.
dialog: 
text: Through the crack of the door, MARIA sees those images on the wall, SALVATORE
text: rocking his head back and forth slowly, like he used to do as a boy when he
text: cried. She somehow feels his grief, his bitterness, lowers her eyes and walks
text: away without a word, as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank,
text: empty...And SALVATORE sits there gazing at it, as if he saw other scenes which
text: his camera never set down on film, only his memory.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 108 HIGH SCHOOL. STREETS AND LITTLE SQUARE. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS are coming out after school. Happy young faces. That
text: GIRL 's motorcycle can be seen in a rear-view mirror. SALVATORE is at the wheel
text: of the car ALFIO has lent him. He has obviously followed that motorcycle before.
text: He waits with an eagerness he thought he had long lost, a determination to
dialog: understand, to get to the bottom of the matter, which frightens him and at the
text: same time overwhelms him hopelessly.
dialog: 
text: And here she comes. She unlocks the padlock and prepares to speed off. SALVATORE
text: starts the motor and follows her a short distance away. The GIRL heads for the
text: new residential district on the outskirts.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 109 SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: MARIA is setting the table. LIA and her family are eating at her
text: house today. SALVATORE is sitting again, with a lighted cigarette,
text: gazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the
text: rolling sea. The air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a
text: heaviness to the silence, like the troubled look on his face. MARIA glances at
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: What are you thinking, Toto?
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE looks at the old woman's lovely face, a faint smile. on his lips.
dialog: There was always something like an unspoken rule between them, the rule of
text: silence, of unconfessed complicity. And now he feels that rule has to be broken.
text: He speaks quietly, as if to curb the tumult of his feelings of guilt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I was thinking...that we've never
dialog: talked, Mamma...When I was little I
dialog: saw you as if you were already old.
dialog: That's probably true with all kids...
dialog: Who knows?
text: (She nods, then sits down
text: before him. He strokes her
dialog: old, skinny, heavily
dialog: veined hands...)
dialog: But only now do I realize you were
dialog: young, you were beautiful, had a
dialog: whole life before you. But how...
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: ...how could you have lived alone
dialog: all that time, with no one to look
dialog: after you? You could have
dialog: remarried...Why not? At the time I
dialog: probably wouldn't have understood,
dialog: but I would have later...
dialog: 
text: MARIA doesn't answer, but she is not troubled. An inner peace lends her a sweet,
text: quiet expression. Then she too agrees to break the rule of silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I never had anybody. If that's what
dialog: you think...I didn't want anybody. I
dialog: always remained faithful. First to
dialog: your father, then to you, to Lia.
dialog: (With a shrug)
dialog: That's the way I'm made, there's
dialog: nothing I can do about it.
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: And you're like me, you're too honest
dialog: and too attached to the things you
dialog: love...But I don't know if that's a
dialog: good thing. Faithfulness is a bad
dialog: business. If you're faithful, you're
dialog: always alone!
text: (SALVATORE is immersed in
dialog: the profound truth of
dialog: those words. And he says
dialog: nothing. The silence is
text: broken by the ringing of
text: the phone. A menacing
dialog: sound, which SALVATORE
dialog: cannot bear. He knows they
dialog: are calling him from Rome,
text: gives a nervous gesture,
text: stands up and pulls out
dialog: the plug. The silence
text: returns, the whistling of
text: the wind. MARIA lowers her
dialog: eyes.)
dialog: It's my fault! It would have been
dialog: better if I hadn't called you...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE sits down again, leaning closer to her. He stubs out his cigarette in
text: the already overflowing ashtray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: No...It's nothing to do with you.
dialog: It's just that I was scared of coming
dialog: back. Now, after all these years, I
dialog: thought I was strong, that I had
dialog: forgotten lots of things. Instead, I
dialog: find it's quite the opposite, as if I
dialog: had never left. And yet, I look at
dialog: Lia and feel as if I didn't know her,
dialog: and you, Mamma...I abandoned you,
text: ran away like a thief, thought only
dialog: of myself, and never gave you
dialog: an explanation...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (Interrupting him)
dialog: And I never asked for one! You have
dialog: nothing to explain. I always thought
dialog: that what you did was right, and that
dialog: was that. With no beating around the
dialog: bush...
dialog: (Smiling, playing it down)
dialog: Only one thing made me suffer:
text: bolting the door shut before going to
dialog: bed at night...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: You never used to do that!
dialog: 
text: She smiles like a little girl who is about to confess the fibs she has told.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No, no...When you used to work at
dialog: the movies, I could never get to
dialog: sleep at night until you came home.
dialog: Then when you arrived, I pretended to
dialog: be asleep, but I heard all your
dialog: movements. Then when you fell asleep,
dialog: I'd get up and bolt the door. Then,
dialog: when you left, every time I did it, I
dialog: felt as if I had left somebody
text: outside the door, far away....
dialog: (SALVATORE listens to his
text: MOTHER'S words, surprised
dialog: and entranced by the
dialog: poetry of her way of
dialog: speaking...)
dialog: But you were right to leave. You
dialog: succeeded in doing what you wanted to
dialog: do...
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: When I call you, a different, woman
dialog: always answers. I pretend I know them
dialog: so they won't have to go through the
dialog: embarrassment of introducing
dialog: themselves.
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: I'm sure they take me for a crazy old
dialog: woman. But so far I've never heard
dialog: one voice that really loves you...I
dialog: would have known. And yet, I'd like
dialog: to see you...settled down...fall in
dialog: love...
dialog: (Gazing into his eyes)
dialog: But your life's there. Here there are
dialog: nothing but ghosts, Toto! Let it go.
dialog: 
text: She has said this with a subtle allusiveness in her voice. And SALVATORE
text: realizes she has always known everything. But he doesn't' answer her.
text: They look at each other a Long time without speaking. Their rule of conniving
text: silence has come back into play, as before, forever. It is her expression that
text: tells him to leave, to take the plane and fly away...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 110 SMALL SQUARE AND HOUSE. INT/EXT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: But SALVATORE has not taken his MOTHER'S advice. Re has not left. Something
text: holds him there still, leads him to go on looking.
dialog: 
text: The GIRL'S motorcycle is parked in the courtyard beyond the gate of a small
text: house. He is studying it from inside the car parked in a corner of the small
text: square, near a café. Re has been there some while, but is not nervous, waits
dialog: there with determination...
dialog: 
text: Several windows in the house are lit, but no one can be seen through
text: the curtains. Nothing but shadows pass by every now and then. Now the light in
text: one of the windows goes out, and the light on the stair goes on. The front door
text: opens and the GIRL comes out with a tall, sturdy- looking, elegantly dressed
text: GENTLEMAN around fifty.
dialog: 
text: They converse bur are too far away for their voices to be heard. SALVATORE
text: watches them come out the gate and climb into a car. They look like father and
text: daughter. The car now drives off and passes right by him. A gleam of light,
text: the reflection from the headlights, falls on the GENTLEMAN'S face. He recognizes
text: him at once, from the birthmark on his temple...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (To himself)
dialog: Boccia!
dialog: 
text: His eyes flash, he's afraid he's understood. And now the craze to get to the
text: bottom of it all gnaws away at him. There is no turning back.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 111 CAFÉ. AND SMALL SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE'S hands rifle through a phone directory. He is in the cafe, on the
text: other side of the glass door leading to the little square. His finger
text: runs down the column of names...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (Mumbling)
dialog: His last name was Lo Meo, Vincenzo.
dialog: 
text: He has already put the token into the slot and dials the number, looking at the
text: two lit upstairs windows of that house, where the mystery of his life may be
text: hiding. SALVATORE hears the first ring, his heart in his throat...A shadow
text: appears in one of the windows. And a voice answers.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOICE ON TELEPHONE
dialog: Hello?
text: (It's a woman's voice.
text: SALVATORE shuts his eyes,
text: is about to speak, but the
text: lump in his throat
dialog: silences him...)
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOICE ON TELEPHONE
dialog: Hello? Hello?
dialog: 
text: He still hesitates, can' t get a word out, as if he had lost his voice or
text: didn't know what to say. He hangs up. The shadow at the window also hangs up,
dialog: then disappears...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is at a loss, sits down at one of the rabies near the
text: phone in the almost empty cafe. At the far end, a group of five people watching
dialog: television.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: You want something?
dialog: 
text: And he turns back to the television. SALVATORE lights a cigarette. He is
text: uncertain. Once again he has to lake an important decision redial the number
dialog: and seek a face behind that shadow? Or forget the whole thing, the GIRL, BOCCIA,
dialog: the shadow, and go away? Yes, best go away. He gets up and leaves. He can be
text: seen through the window turning the comer. A pack of cigarettes and a lighter
text: lie on the table, he has forgotten them. And the lighted cigarette bums down in
text: the ashtray. A few moments have gone by. Footsteps, and a hand picks up the
text: lighter and the cigarettes. It is SALVATORE who now, on a sudden urge, slips
text: another token into the slot. The shadow reappears at the window. The same voice
dialog: as before.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOICE ON TELEPHONE
dialog: Hello, who's speaking?
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE answers at last, keeping his eyes shut, whispering:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I'd like to speak to Signora Elena...
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOICE ON TELEPHONE
dialog: Speaking. Who is it, please?
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE feels a terrible pang, continues:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Salvatore.
dialog: 
text: Silence, charged with tension. Then the voice continues weakly, as if puzzled.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOICE ON TELEPHONE
dialog: Salvatore...who?
dialog: 
text: He runs his hand over his forehead, his eyes, as if to soothe the turmoil he
dialog: feels inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Di Vita. Salvatore Di Vita. Do you
dialog: remember?
dialog: (Another pause chilly,
text: heavy. SALVATORE opens his
text: eyes, looks at the window.
text: Her shadow is motionless,
dialog: as if cut out of
dialog: cardboard.)
dialog: Elena, I'm here, in the bar, across
dialog: the street from your house.
dialog: 
text: The shadow moves slowly, a hand pulls aside the curtain. It's a moment of heart-
text: rending emotion...She appears. And they see each other from a distance, after
text: thirty years, each of them with a phone receiver to their ear. But she is
text: somewhat in the dark, against the light, it's impossible to make out her
text: features. Her voice gives a sudden start, instantly controlled.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOICE ON TELEPHONE
dialog: Certainly, I remember...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE'S eyes glisten, try to pierce the distance and the darkness to get a
dialog: better look, but in vain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Elena. I'd like to see you...Let's
dialog: meet.
dialog: 
text: ELENA lets the curtain drop and goes back to being a shadow. She whispers the
dialog: words.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOICE ON TELEPHONE
dialog: It's been so long. Why should we
dialog: meet? What good would it do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Please, don't say no.. .
dialog: 
text: But her voice is firm, unshakeable, even if quivering with emotion.
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOICE ON TELEPHONE
dialog: I'm old, Salvatore. And you too. It's
dialog: best not to meet. Goodbye.
dialog: 
text: The shadow hangs up, disappears. The light goes off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 112 DIFFERENT SETTINGS. INT/EXT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: The wind is stronger now, the streets and the square are empty. SALVATORE
text: is at the wheel of the car, driving aimlessly around the town. He has
dialog: rediscovered the woman who conditioned his whole life and they hadn't had the
text: courage to meet. An obsessive musical heat, fraught with rage, pours out of the
dialog: car radio.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 113 SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING
dialog: 
text: A phone ringing drowns out the sound of the television and the wind
text: whistling outside. In the half-darkened room, MARIA picks up the receiver...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
text: No one answers, but she can sense the presence of someone who now hangs up.
dialog: MARIA is alarmed. Who could it be at this hour? And where is Toto?
dialog: 
scene_heading: 114 SEAFRONT AND PIER. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE stands motionless on the pier, facing the storm-tossed sea. He feels
text: relieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts, blurs them,
text: but does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes. A flashing light seems
text: to approach behind his back. SALVATORE turns and is blinded by the headlights of
text: a car parked at the beginning of the pier. The splattering waves lend the scene
text: a hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights. Now the lights
text: move towards him. And SALVATORE also lakes a few timid steps forward...
text: They are close. The car has almost stopped. But it is impossible to make out the
text: person at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door. A voice can be
text: barely heard over the raging sea. It is ELENA's voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Salvatore!
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE approaches, accepting the invitation, enters the car and shuts the
text: door. The headlights go off and the car remains there suspended between the open
text: sea and the harbor with its rocking boats. Inside the car, not a word. Two dark
text: figures gaze at each other, unintelligible, as if the night were trying to
text: further delay that meeting. The glowing reflection of a wave higher than the
text: others now lights up their faces. ELENA was right, they are no longer the faces
text: of teenagers, but of people on in years who study each other, searching for a
text: truth. The howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder, but
text: ELENA and SALVATORE /rear nothing, sit glued to their seats, fixed in the
text: endless gaze that envelops them. He is the first to break the silence in a faint
dialog: voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: How'd you know I'd be here?
dialog: 
dialog: ELENA I don't know how many years have gone by, but some things about you I do
dialog: remember. There weren't many, places you could have gone. I looked around...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE turns on the light of the rear-view mirror. Finally
text: they can see better. They look at each other a little ill at ease,
text: making the inevitable comparisons with the memory of their young faces.
text: SALVATORE carefully observes her graying hair, her blue eyes lined
text: with wrinkles, the somewhat faded beauty mark on her lip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: You're still beautiful...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Don't be silly...I'm old.
dialog: (She looks down troubled
dialog: by the way he has of
text: gazing into her eyes,
text: speaks almost mumbling her
dialog: words.)
dialog: Don't look at me like that, please.
dialog: (And she switches off the
dialog: light. But this time it is
dialog: less dark, things can be
dialog: seen.)
dialog: Why'd you come back?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Of course I remember him. I'm sorry.
dialog: You were terribly fond of him.
dialog: 
text: A moment of silence. It's hard to find something to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I saw your daughter. She's beautiful!
dialog: Who knows how many Salvatores
dialog: must be running after her...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: One or two. Bur there're not all that
dialog: many Salvatores.
dialog: (SALVATORE also smiles,
text: but a puzzled smile as if
dialog: what she has said had
dialog: thrown him off-guard.)
dialog: I've got a son, too...he's older.
dialog: And you, do you have children?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: No. And I'm not married.
speaker_heading: (ELENA sits there in
text: silence. A veil of sadness
text: clouds her eyes.
speaker_heading: SALVATORE'S
dialog: too...)
dialog: Are you happy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: All things considered, yes. Even if
dialog: it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
dialog: 
text: Again SALVATORE is thrown off-guard, as if the round key of
text: his enquiry had met with only square locks. She continues.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: My husband...you know him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Sure, sure! Boccia...
dialog: (With a bitter smile)
dialog: What's he do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Politics. He's the district
dialog: representative. We met at the
dialog: University in Pisa.
dialog: 
text: Then instinctively, in a shy voice, SALVATORE asks the question
dialog: that he probably wouldn't have asked a moment later.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: And...how come you never married
dialog: that guy from Tuscany?
dialog: 
text: The white foam of the waves splashes up over the wall of the pier, dashing
text: against the car windows. The shadow of the trickling water is superimposed on
text: the agony of their faces. ELENA hides her embarrassment beneath a faint but
text: haughty smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I didn't want to...I had to fight
dialog: tooth and nail. But in the end I
dialog: won...
dialog: (SALVATORE is unable to
dialog: smile. It's as if the void
dialog: were growing and swelling
dialog: within. Thunder and
text: lightning shatter the
dialog: roaring of the wind and
dialog: sea, hut it does not rain.
text: Now her smile Jades away.)
dialog: At that time...I was waiting for
dialog: you...
dialog: 
text: There is no resentment in her words. She has said them fondly. With the serenity
dialog: of someone who has suffered greatly and then found a strong convincing way of
text: suffering no more. For SALVATORE, it's as if one of those thunderbolts had
text: pierced his heart. He leans over, gazing into her shining eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: (Whispering)
dialog: Nor have I. Even though you
dialog: disappeared...
dialog: (SALVATORE is staggered,
dialog: feels as if he were
text: plunging into the void.
dialog: What she has said strikes
text: him as grotesque. ELENA
text: strokes his hair, as if to
dialog: restrain his sinking
dialog: heart, gives a sweet
dialog: smile.)
dialog: But what's the point of talking about
dialog: it? We risk being pathetic and
dialog: ridiculous.
dialog: (And she tries to change
dialog: the subject.)
dialog: You still live in Rome?
dialog: 
text: But SALVATORE ignores the question. He doesn't want to change the subject.
text: He feels that everything is crumbling inside him, the alibis and excuses he had
dialog: had to give himself in order to accept the end of their romance. And instead,
text: now the tables seem to have completely turned. Without realizing, he shouts
text: desperately, staring wildly at her and shaking her by the
dialog: shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: What do you mean, you were waiting
dialog: for me?! What are you saying?
dialog: (He controls himself at
dialog: once, continues, breathing
dialog: heavily.)
dialog: The last time we saw each other, we
dialog: made a date to meet at the Cinema
dialog: Paradiso. You remember? And you
dialog: didn't come, you disappeared without
dialog: leaving a trace, nothing! I'll tell
dialog: you how many years have gone by: more
dialog: than thirty!!!
dialog: 
text: Quiet rears stream down Elena's face, glisten with the reflections of the
text: lightning and the waves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I kept that date.
text: (SALVATORE laughs at the
dialog: absurdity of it. A
text: nervous, heartbroken
text: laugh, which slowly melts
text: away as she goes on to
dialog: say:)
dialog: But I was late...
dialog: (Tears continue to stream
text: out of her blue eyes, but
text: she tells her story in a
dialog: calm voice.)
dialog: I had a fight with my family. I tried
dialog: to convince them again that they
dialog: couldn't separate us. But it was
dialog: futile. They had decided to leave
dialog: Sicily once and for all. Which is
dialog: what we did. I didn't know what to do
dialog: any more, what to say. And I said
dialog: yes, I'd do whatever they wanted. In
dialog: return, my father promised to let me
dialog: see you one last time, to say
dialog: goodbye. But I hoped that by seeing
dialog: each other we could take advantage of
dialog: it and make a decision...I thought
dialog: we would run away together.
text: (She holds back her sobs.
text: Dries her tears with the
text: back of her hand, and
dialog: continues:)
dialog: My father drove me to the movie
dialog: theatre. But you weren't in the
dialog: projection booth. Only Alfredo...
dialog: 
text: Her voice continues over the scene of same thirty years before...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA'S VOICE
dialog: (Off-screen)
dialog: So I told Alfredo how things stood
dialog: and fiat I was leaving the same

speaker_heading: ALFREDO
dialog: Easy, easy.
dialog: (Sighing)
dialog: Listen carefully to what I have to
dialog: say. If you want me to tell Toto what
dialog: you've told me, I will. But if you
dialog: want my advice, forget it. It's
dialog: better for both of you if you don't
dialog: see each other...
dialog: (YOUNG ELENA gives a start
dialog: of resentment, listens
dialog: with surprise.)
dialog: Dear girl, fire always turns into
dialog: ashes! Even the deepest love ends
dialog: sooner or later. And after that other
dialog: loves appear, lots of them. Toto, he
dialog: can't understand fiat now. If I tell
dialog: him he won't believe it, he' d be
dialog: capable of killing me...But you can
dialog: understand, you've got to

dialog: 
text: SALVATORE sits there without moving, pale as a sheet, looks as if he had
text: grown even older. As if the whole world has fallen in on him. For ELENA, it was
text: a painful but liberating story. She dries her last tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: It's the first time I've had to
dialog: chance to tell the story. I never
dialog: mentioned it to anybody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: (In a daze)
dialog: Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell
dialog: on you too!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I told him I'd take his advice. But
dialog: before I went away I left you that
dialog: note...
dialog: (SALVATORE gives her a
dialog: quick look, a questioning
dialog: look. He listens.)
dialog: I was on my way down the stairs...
dialog: (Her voice continues, laid
dialog: over the...)

scene_heading: 117 CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON Flashback
dialog: 
text: ELENA has already said goodbye to ALFREDO, is on her way down the stairs, but
text: stops short.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA' S VOICE
dialog: (Off-screen)
dialog: I thought Alfredo couldn't see me. So
dialog: I snuck back up...
text: (She tip-toes back without
dialog: making any noise. Goes
text: over to the film-winder.
text: Takes out a pen, looks for
text: a scrap of paper, but
text: doesn't see any. Her eyes
dialog: fall on the film receipts
text: hanging on the nail. She
dialog: tears off the top one,
dialog: turns it over and
text: scribbles a message on the
dialog: back.)
dialog: I wrote you where you could find me,
dialog: and that I'd wait for you.
dialog: 
text: She hangs the scrap of paper back on the nail, well in sight. She creeps out,
text: glancing at ALFREDO, who hasn't noticed a thing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 118 WATERFRONT. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING
dialog: 
text: ELENA finishes telling her story. She heaves a Jeep sigh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: But you disappeared all the same.
dialog: 
text: There is a haunted look in SALVATORE's eyes, he is searching his memory for
text: something he can't find, then suddenly sees, as if in a dream...his hand thirty
text: years before going through the routine gesture of hanging a receipt on the nail,
text: over the others, mechanically, without even looking...and he shuts his eyes as
text: if fearing the truth. Her last words have wounded him. He shakes his head, then
text: in a faint voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Oh, how I looked for you, Elena!
dialog: You'll never know. I wrote,
dialog: telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever
dialog: answered. But I dreamt of you for
dialog: years! That's why I went away...and
dialog: never came back here.
dialog: (And his anguish breaks
text: free, dissolving into
text: quiet, almost childish
text: tears. ELENA is startled
dialog: by his reaction. She
dialog: caresses him,
text: passionately. They embrace
dialog: and remain like that, she
text: with her face buried in
dialog: his shoulder, he leaning
text: on hers with his tear-
dialog: filled eyes.)
dialog: Even as the years passed, in all the
dialog: women I met, I was only looking for
dialog: you. I had success it's true, but
dialog: there was always something missing...
dialog: (She is deeply moved, goes
text: on caressing him gently
text: until he calms down. The
dialog: car windows are steamed
dialog: up. The sea, the harbor,
dialog: the waves have
dialog: disappeared. Nothing
text: remains but the sound of
text: the storm. SALVATORE takes
dialog: her face between his
text: hands. They gaze at each
dialog: other, their faces
text: practically touching. He
dialog: murmurs:)
dialog: I'd never have imagined that all this
dialog: had to end because of the man who was
dialog: like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!
text: (She gives a faint smile.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I
dialog: was upset. I think I really hated
dialog: him. But then, with time, I
dialog: understood what he said...and your
dialog: silence too.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE whispers one last dreadful revelation. And it's as if he had got a
text: terrible weight off his chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: But I never saw that note!
text: (He squints, as if to
dialog: stress the absurdity of
dialog: the idea.)
dialog: I must have covered it with my hand,
dialog: without realizing it, that's the only
dialog: explanation...
dialog: (But strangely enough,
dialog: ELENA is not surprised.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: What difference does it make to find
dialog: an explanation? That's the way it
dialog: went. But Alfredo didn't betray you,
dialog: he was the only one who really
dialog: understood you. Salvatore, if you had
dialog: chosen to be with me, you'd have
dialog: never made your films. And that would
dialog: have been a pity! Because they're
dialog: wonderful, I've seen them all.
text: (Her eyes glitter with
text: joy, then she smiles,
dialog: almost ironically.)
dialog: But you shouldn't have gone and
dialog: changed your name. You should have
dialog: kept your own.
dialog: 
text: Tears stream down Salvatore's cheeks. He gives her a look of longing, of
dialog: desire.
dialog: 
text: ELENA embraces him. They kiss with heartrending tenderness, with the same
text: passion of their first kiss amidst the strips of film brushing their faces, so
text: many years ago. And they make love, clasped in the cramped quarters of the car,
text: like two teenagers. Passionate kisses, embraces, deep sighs. Their hair
text: damp with sweat, their hands clasping, their fingers interweaving. Then the
text: frenzy subsides into a deep, tumultuous pleasure, of immense loving and immense
text: grief...As outside the wind and the waves go on rating around that car which
text: seems suspended in empty space.)

scene_heading: 119 ALFREDO'S WIDOW'S HOUSE. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: SIGNORA ANNA'S hands place an old wooden stool and a rusty round
text: metal can on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: These are the things he left to
dialog: you...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is sitting by the table. He has finished the cup of coffee SIGNORA
text: ANNA has prepared for him. He picks up the stool, recognizes it at once: it's
text: the one ALFREDO had made for him as a little boy so he could climb up and put
text: the reels on the projector.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: When they showed your films on
dialog: television, he was happy. He'd plop
dialog: himself down there and all his
dialog: ailments were forgotten. He knew all
dialog: the words by heart, every one, and
dialog: I'd describe what was going on. And
dialog: when the papers talked about
dialog: you, I had to read them two or three
dialog: times...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE examines the can, wonders what it can be. He opens it: inside is a
text: reel of film, wrapped in a plastic bag, well preserved. Those objects bring a
text: pang to his heart, and the things that ANNA said, but he feels disappointed, as
dialog: if he expected to find something else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Did he ever think of meeting me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: No, never! One time your mother said
dialog: that if he wanted, you'd have surely
dialog: come. He got furious and said 'No,
dialog: Toto mustn't come back to Giancaldo,
dialog: never!!' He didn't say it to be mean.
dialog: He was a decent man. Who knows what
dialog: he could have been thinking? Towards
dialog: the end he'd say such strange things.
text: And a moment before he shut his eyes,
dialog: he told your mother not to let you
dialog: know.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 120 CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: A cloud of yellowed scraps of paper flutters into the air and as it falls slowly
text: to the ground another handful is flung up. SALVATORE is in the projection booth,
text: looking through the countless yellowed receipts, stuffed away in boxes. He looks
text: at them one by one, then throws them into the air. A desperate search, almost a
text: defiance of the passing of time. He continues with greater determination, flings
text: piles of receipts into the air, glances at a few dates, a film title, tries to
text: discover the oldest dates at the bottom. He moves swiftly, his hands plunge in,
text: then fling up a nimbus of paper and dust. But to no avail...He stops, short of
text: breath. His eyes go over to the nails in the wall, where other stacks of
text: receipts are hanging. He gets up and goes to look at them, thumbs " it through
dialog: them hastily, in anger...
dialog: 
text: He yanks off two or three packs, which come off, nail and all. Only then does he
text: notice that at the bottom of those blocks of yellowed paper, there are same more
text: sheets, much older, almost brown. His eyes concentrate on the mildewed scraps of
text: paper. He leans over, picks themup and goes through them one by one, delicately,
text: because they crumble in his fingers...And then all of a sudden, some film
dialog: titles
text: he recognizes from that time. He goes on thumbing through them, and all at once
text: an astonished look appears on his face in his hands is a receipt that has been
text: turned over. It's the one! The message scribbled on it can still be seen. He
dialog: reads it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE'S VOICE
dialog: (Off-screen)
dialog: Salvatore, forgive me. I'll explain
dialog: later what happened. Not finding you
dialog: here was terrible. Unfortunately,
dialog: this evening, my mother and I are
dialog: leaving for Tuscany. We're moving
dialog: there. But you' re the only one I
dialog: love, I'll never be with anybody
dialog: else, I promise. Here's the address
dialog: of a girlfriend of mine where you
dialog: can write to me. Don't abandon me.
text: Love and kisses, Elena.
dialog: 
text: He clasps the scrap of paper, and his brimming eyes darken with regret.

scene_heading: 121 CAFÉ~ IN SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. INT/EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: ELENA stands near the window overlooking the little square, listening on the
text: phone to SALVATORE'S voice. She can see him through the transparent curtain
text: speaking on the phone down below in the café.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: When are you leaving?
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE opens his eyes, tosses away his cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: This afternoon. Elena, in the future
dialog: maybe we could...
dialog: 
text: ELENA interrupts him, speaks softly, tenderly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: No, Salvatore...there is no future.
dialog: There's only the past. Even meeting
dialog: last night was nothing but a dream, a
dialog: beautiful dream.
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: We never did it when we were kids,
dialog: remember?
dialog: (Down in the cafe,
text: SALVATORE nods his head
text: slowly, desperately.)
dialog: Now that it's happened, I don't think
dialog: there could have been a better
dialog: ending.
dialog: (It's farewell. SALVATORE
dialog: glances one last time at
dialog: that window.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: I'll never agree with you. Never,
dialog: Elena.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 122 CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The square, unusually empty. There is no one, and no cars and motorcycles are
text: parked in the middle. The stores are shut. And there is an unreal silence. The
text: houses on the two streets on either side of the theatre are covered by enormous
text: pieces of gray canvas.
dialog: 
text: Only now does the camera discover in the distance, a crowd of curious onlookers
text: waiting in front of the movie house, kept at a safe distance by firemen and
text: policemen. Old SPACCAFICO is in the crowd. SALVATORE is also there. Be gazes at
text: the front of the old movie theatre...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 123 CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The inside of the theatre, completely empty...All of a sudden, a blinding flash
dialog: and...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 124 SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: ...a deafening roar rends the air, accompanied by a surge of amazement in the
text: crowd. And the Cinema Paradiso suddenly collapses, folds inward and disappears
text: for ever in a gigantic cloud of white smoke that rises into the air, carried by
text: the wind towards the crowd...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 125 ELENA' S HOUSE. INT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The echo of the explosion is also heard in ELENA'S house. She is alone.
text: And the bang distresses her, as if something had burst inside her. From her face
dialog: to...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 126 SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE's face, stiff, unmoving, his eyes fixed on those falling ruins, on
text: that season of his life turning into smoke and dust. Enveloped in the white
text: cloud, SPACCAFICO stands crying in silence.
dialog: 
text: Mice dart out of the ruins in terror, scamper nervously into the square. A group
text: of youngsters scream, amused and excited. Among them, ELENA'S DAUGHTER,
text: smiling... SALVATORE sees her joking with friends and pointing to some boys
text: chasing the mice across the square, hooting and laughing. As a white-haired OLD
text: TRAMP, filthy and covered in rags, makes his way through the crowd. There is an
text: empty look in his eyes and he repeats obsessively in a low voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VILLAGE IDIOT
text: The square's mine, the square's mine,
dialog: the square's mine...
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE recognizes him, it's the VILLAGE IDIOT, the one who used to close down
text: the square at night. Be watches him walk off, raving, with nobody even noticing.
text: The crowd now moves over to the huge empty space where the movie house once
text: stood. The murmuring voices are drowned out by the deafening roar of an
text: airplane. From the ruins of the Cinema Paradiso, fade to...

dialog:

dialog: 
text: A COLLEAGUE of SALVATORE comes up behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: Well?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLLEAGUE
dialog: The distributor is opening up the
text: film earlier. The press conference is
dialog: in the afternoon. The actors will
dialog: also be there, the producer, just
dialog: about everyone.
dialog: 
text: An ASSISTANT comes up to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: The official notification of the
dialog: award just came out, but we've
dialog: already received a mountain of
dialog: telegrams. Aren't you happy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVATORE
dialog: It's all right. We'll talk about it
dialog: later.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE walks off towards the viewing theatre.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is by himself in the small viewing theatre. Now the lights go down.
text: The beam of light shines out of the little square hole of the projection booth
text: and the screen lights up. A number trailer goes by and then SALVATORE sees the
dialog: first shots.
dialog: 
text: A start of intense amazement and joy suddenly runs through him, astounds him,
dialog: delights him. It's the best piece of film he has ever seen...
dialog: 
text: It consists of all the kisses ALFREDO cut out of the films and kept for him,
text: when he was a little boy. They have been spliced together, one , after the
text: other, at random, same of them even upside down. And yet it looks like a first-
dialog: rate editing job.
dialog: 
text: In rapid sequence the passionate kisses between actors and actresses, names
dialog: famous and names unknown in the history of movies. Greta Garbo, Gary Cooper,
dialog: Alida Valii, Rudolph Valentino, Ingrid Bergman, Clark Gable, Anna Magnani,
text: Humphrey Bogart, Marlene Dietrich, Amedeo Nazzari, Luisa Ferida, Vittorio De
text: Sica, Rita Hayworth, Tyrone Power, Doris Durante, Massimo Gironi, Marta Abba,
dialog: Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Assia Noris...
dialog: 
text: A whole movie season summed up in a few fragments, a few seconds. A bizarre,
text: poignant, melancholy parade.
dialog: 
text: SALVATORE is overwhelmed, moved to tears. It is the most profound act of love he
text: has ever seen. He laughs as tears shine in his eyes. Up on the screen, another
text: kiss, the last kiss marking the happy ending of a film. And the age-old words
dialog: appear 'THE END'.
