dialog: Eighth Revised Draft
dialog: October 26, 1999
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON -
text: A photo of a happy young woman at the beach. Her candid
text: expression suggests that she did not know she was being
dialog: photographed.
text: TRACK -- Off the picture, revealing that it is one of
text: many photographs of the same woman pasted onto a wall in
text: something of a collage of photos, newspaper clippings,
text: hand-written letters, and notes as well as eclectic
dialog: personal items (postcards, match books, birthday cards,
dialog: etc.).
text: The collage appears to be lit by candlelight.
text: In each photo she is either alone or the others in the
text: photograph have been roughly cut from the frame with
text: scissors. Though the woman appears attractive and happy,
text: there is something disturbing about the haphazard pasting
dialog: and cutting of the pictures.
text: As the frame tracks, glimpsed headlines read:
scene_heading: INQUIRY CLEARS AGENT OF NEGLIGENCE, INDEFINITE
scene_heading: LEAVE BEGINS; CHARRED REMAINS IDENTIFIED,
scene_heading: LINKED TO SERIAL KILLER; DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO
speaker_heading: NINETEEN.
text: The frame tracks over crime scene photos -- a burned out
text: house surrounded by police and emergency vehicles; a shot
text: inside the same house (blackened walls and furniture); a
text: shot of a white sheet standing out in the middle of the
text: room; a closer shot of the same sheet, a human form
text: underneath; the sheet pulled back exposing a badly burned
dialog: body.
text: The frame has traveled full circle around the collage and
text: comes to rest again on the first picture of the young
dialog: woman.
text: With startling effect, a man's hand enters frame and
text: caresses the woman's cheek.
speaker_heading: -BLACK-
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - NIGHT
text: The low moon illuminates the quiet lake. The beautiful
text: Chicago skyline glimmers in the distance. All is still
dialog: until-
text: From behind the skyline a WHIRRING mass of rotor blades
text: appears gradually closing in our position. Soon, three
text: F.B.I. helicopters BOOM past and continue on, sweeping
text: low across the water.
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - CONTINUOUS
text: A dozen police vehicles scream through the streets of
dialog: Chicago.
text: Two motorcycle cops have blocked cross traffic and the
text: convoy races through the light.
text: When the convoy passes, the two motorcycles race back
text: past the convoy, ready to block the next intersection.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - CONTINUOUS
text: Spirited CUBAN MUSIC fills this expensively decorated and
text: trendy loft.
text: Windows compromise one whole wall of the room offering a
text: stunning view over the lake.
text: DAVID ALLEN GRIFFIN (35, handsome; despite his apparent
text: good mood, he has an eerie presence) suddenly dances into
dialog: frame.
text: He whirls and steps unselfconsciously to the feisty
text: rhythms, holding a heavy black automatic pistol in one
dialog: hand.
text: Mid-twirl he turns and addresses someone off camera.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Ooh. This song is faboo. Do
dialog: you feel that? The rhythm?
text: It's alive.
text: He dances, humming along with the song and occasionally
text: turning to look playfully at his image in a large three-
text: pane mirror as if he were flirting with an unseen
dialog: partner.
scene_heading: INT. F.B.I. COMMAND HELICOPTER: CONTINUOUS
text: The helicopter moves low and fast over a desolate expanse
dialog: of water.
text: Behind the COMMAND PILOT, several FEDERAL AGENTS gaze
text: soberly toward their destination.
text: ON THE COMMAND PILOT: His profile taut in the florescent
text: glow of his monitor.
text: The lights of Chicago disappear in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - CONTINUOUS
text: Griffin continues to dance for a moment before winding
text: his motion down gracefully as the song fades.
text: In the absence of music we hear for the first time the
text: sound of a WOMAN in the room quietly crying and
text: whimpering nearby.
text: The next SONG suddenly jumps to life on the CD player and
text: Griffin launches into another dance number, again humming
dialog: along.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMAND HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
text: HOVERING FOR A MOMENT high above the glittering water,
text: they PLUNGE toward their target.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Police vans and patrol cars screech to a lurching halt in
text: front of the warehouse.
text: The rear doors of the vans burst open and one after
text: another, COPS in riot gear pour out onto the pavement.
scene_heading: EXT. NEARBY ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
text: On the rooftop of a nearby building, there is a
text: tremendous build-up of police personnel.
text: A S.W.A.T. COMMANDER motions for his men to clear the way
text: as the three helicopters rise over the rooftop's ledge
text: and land in unison.
text: The federal agents duck the churning blade as they rush
text: into the nearest stairwell. Dozens of helmeted cops line
text: the roof's ledge.
text: VARIOUS ANGLES ON high-powered rifles, trained on the
dialog: warehouse.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE, LIVE/WORK LOFT - CONTINUOUS
text: AS a song ends, Griffin addresses someone off camera.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: I don't know how you can just
dialog: sit there with music like this.
dialog: Such a waste.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE, FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: A small army pours into the building through every ground
dialog: floor entrance.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: A metal door crashes open as waves of S.W.A.T. officers
text: storm the darkened basement. As they advance, their red-

text: cavernous basement.
scene_heading: S.W.A.T. OFFICER
dialog: (into his headset)
text: Basement's clear.
scene_heading: EXT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

dialog: ram.
text: FREEZE THE IMAGE. A voice is heard.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
dialog: It's never that easy. You go
dialog: through the door and they're
dialog: never just sitting there waiting
dialog: for you, a welcoming smile on
dialog: their face.
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
text: JOEL CAMPBELL (late 30s, weary, scraggy, full beard,
text: baggy chords, a baseball cap) sits across from his
text: psychiatrist POLLY BEILMAN (37, attractive, poised).
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: The best we can do is hope they
dialog: fuck up and do what we can to be
dialog: there when they do.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Do you blame yourself for the
dialog: killings?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: No, I blame the asshole who did
dialog: them.
text: Polly almost cracks a smile.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: No. I don't blame myself for
dialog: not catching him, if that's what
dialog: you mean. This isn't a guy
dialog: whose been in and out of an
dialog: institution his whole life...
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET CORNER - DAY
text: A black and white cruiser has pulled over an older model
text: station wagon. TWO COPS walk up on either side of the
dialog: car.
text: As he approaches the driver, Cop #1 suddenly draws his
text: weapon. Cop #2 follows his lead.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
text: ...whose brain finally pops and
text: he slaughters five people then
dialog: drives around in the family
text: station wagon till a cop sees

text: The DRIVER raises his hands. Blood covers his face and
dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: BLOODY GUY
dialog: Is there a problem, officer?
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Back in the office.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: This is a man whose whole life
text: is about killing. He studies
dialog: it. He knows forensics.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONTâ€™D)
text: He understands police procedure.
text: He prepares methodically so as
dialog: not to leave any evidence at the
dialog: scene.
scene_heading: INT. CORNER MARKET - EVENING
text: SHARON (attractive, 27) strolls through a local
text: deli/market with a hand basket full of groceries.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
text: He brings a kit with tools and
text: props. Duct tape, hand cuffs, a
dialog: weapon. Everything he'll need
dialog: for control, pleasure and
dialog: murder.
text: Anonymous POV of Sharon picking through a stack of
dialog: onions.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
dialog: He may watch her for weeks.
scene_heading: EXT. SHARON'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Sharon gets out of her parked car and walks, alone, down
text: the mostly deserted street in a middle-class
dialog: neighborhood.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
dialog: Learn her routine. When she
text: comes home, when she goes to
dialog: sleep.
text: A car drives slowly down the street past her and pulls
text: into a space. The lights go off.
scene_heading: EXT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: POV from outside the window looking in: Sharon prepares
text: herself breakfast in a very revealing outfit.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
text: In the morning, before the sun
text: comes up, he can walk right up
text: next to her.
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Why the morning?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Even though the sun's still
dialog: down, nobody perceives it as
dialog: night. Women that are very
dialog: careful at one a.m., will walk
text: around half naked four hours
dialog: later.
text: Polly makes a quick note on her notepad. Her expression
text: suggests that it's a note to herself to take care in the
dialog: mornings.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Finally, heâ€™d pick a day.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT BUILDING, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Again a CU of a man's feet walking down a long corridor.
text: CU on man's hands as he first puts on a pair of latex
text: gloves, slips pair of cotton gloves over them, and then
text: picks the lock of an old doorknob.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
dialog: He'd let himself into her
dialog: apartment.
text: The lock clicks open and he pushes the door open.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Sharon approaches her apartment door. She fumbles around
text: in her purse for her keys for a long time. Aftera
text: minute she gives up and starts to head back down the
dialog: hallway.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
dialog: That night she'd get home, go
text: about her business, unaware that
text: he was in the house.
text: She gets a few steps away and suddenly stops in her
text: tracks. She found the keys. She turns and lets herself
dialog: in.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The front door swings open, spilling light from the
text: hallway across the small living room. She closes the
text: door behind her and for a few seconds the apartment is
text: totally black. Her footsteps can be heard then BANG!
speaker_heading: YELP!
text: She clicks on a light and rubs her shin. She bumped the
text: coffee table in the dark. She sets down her purse and
text: keys and heads down the dark hallway.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: She steps into the bathroom and flips on the light.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
dialog: She might spend her last moments
dialog: alive in this world taking a
dialog: piss or feeding her cat.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Sharon pushes open her bedroom door and flips on the
text: light and heads towards the closet, pulling her shirt off
text: as she walks.
text: Griffin stands behind the bedroom door, calmly. She
text: doesn't see him. She opens the closet door and begins to
text: rummage through her clothes.
text: Griffin pushes the bedroom door closed with a just
text: audible CLICK. Sharon slowly turns and sees Griffin
text: standing inside the closed bedroom door.
text: She yelps, covers herself with her hands and tries to run
text: but there's nowhere to go. She runs headlong into her
text: tiny closet, pulling down a bunch of her clothes,
text: literally trying to climb the walls.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Sharon sits whimpering loudly on the sofa. She has duct
text: tape across her mouth and her feet are bound together
text: with her own stockings. Griffin stands nearby at a CD
text: rack browsing through her CDs. He takes out a CD and
text: puts it in.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Oh. Here we go. Shall we
dialog: dance?
text: Ballroom dance music suddenly pours out of the stereo.
text: He holds out his hand. Sharon sits, still totally
text: immobilized with fear. She begins to whimper a little
dialog: louder.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, don't play hard to get.
dialog: This'1ll be fun! Shhhhhhh.
dialog: Shhhhhhh.
text: He dances over to her and tries to pick her up but she
text: wails and her body goes limp, slipping out of his arms.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Shhhhhhh. Shhhhhhh.
dialog: (suddenly enraged)
dialog: I said SHUT UP!
dialog: She does.
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: The torture would last hours.
text: Unimaginable terror.
text: Campbell notices that Polly looks uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
dialog: disturb you, I just-
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (snapping out of it)
dialog: No, no. Don't be sorry. This
dialog: is important for you, it's just
dialog: difficult sometimes.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Yeah, tell me about it.
dialog: (points to clock)
dialog: You're off the hook anyway.
text: She looks at the clock on her desk.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (still composing
dialog: herself)
dialog: Yeah. I guess so. Okay, so
dialog: I'll see you next week.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Campbell lets himself into his apartment, a dark
text: unfriendly place. Books and magazines fill every
text: conceivable corner, making the place seem even smaller
dialog: than it is.
text: He tosses a hand-full of mail into a basket of similarly
text: unopened mail. The camera lingers on an unopened FEDERAL
text: EXPRESS envelope.
text: He tosses his jacket carelessly on the couch and crosses
text: the room to the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S BATHROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Campbell enters and washes his face, pulling his shirt
text: tail out. He opens a drawer and pulls out several
text: bottles of prescription medication, opens each one and
text: shakes out a couple pills.
text: He tosses them all into his mouth and takes a drink from
text: the faucet, swallowing them.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
text: Campbell walks into the kitchen looking for food. All he
text: can find as a browning apple which he grabs and heads
dialog: back into:
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: He picks up his keys (which have a Swiss army knife on
dialog: them) and a Victoria's Secret catalogue that came in the
text: mail and sits on the couch. He opens the knife and
text: begins peeling the apple and opens the catalogue,
text: obviously only half-interested in its contents.
text: The apple skin comes off in one long, spiral piece. He
text: sets it on the table and takes a bite of the apple.
text: He loses interest in the catalogue all together and
text: tosses it on the coffee table. He leans back and stares
text: toward the window, lost in thought.
text: TIME LAPSE - The light behind the window shade gradually
text: fades. Campbell still stares at the window until long
text: after dark.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Griffin stands in front of the mirror covered in blood
text: and sweat, exhausted from the ordeal of murder.
text: As he methodically cleans himself up, he addresses
text: himself in the mirror, though he seems to be talking to
dialog: someone else, the way one might speak to a deceased loved
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Where did you go? I wonder what
dialog: happened to you that night?
dialog: Why was it so different from the
dialog: other times? I don't know why
dialog: you were there, how you got so
dialog: close to me that night.
text: He bends over and washes his face.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: But I remember clearly what I
dialog: felt when I heard your footsteps
dialog: falling behind me... Pride. For
dialog: me it was our finest hour. I
dialog: thought it would keep us
dialog: together forever. I can still
dialog: see the flames...
scene_heading: EXT. BURNING HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: Deep black smoke pours from several broken windows. The
text: orange flicker of fire light can be seen behind several
dialog: other windows.
text: Campbell (younger) gun in hand, sprints down a dark
text: deserted alley toward the house. Though he runs as hard
text: as he can, in dreamlike fashion he doesn't seem to making
dialog: very much progress.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Campbell running up the back staircase and into the back
text: door, immediately ducking away from the rush of flames
dialog: and heat.
text: He covers his mouth with his arm and pushes into the back
dialog: hallway.
scene_heading: INT. BURNING HOUSE, BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK
text: A WOMAN'S hideous SCREAMS of agony and fear. Campbell
text: pushes further down the crumbling hallway, dodging
text: burning debris that falls around him. His progress is
text: impeded by thick smoke that blurs what's happening. He
text: can just make out the image of a woman sitting in a chair
text: in a room at the end of the hallway.
text: She SCREAMS again, a long piercing howl.
text: The camera focuses in on a wall of flames until it fills
text: the entire frame.
text: Images of horrible prime scenes begin to appear
text: superimposed over the flames: horribly mutilated bodies,
text: pools of blood, bloody clothes, murder weapons. The
dialog: scream continues throughout until-
text: -CAMPBELL WAKES WITH A JOLT IN
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: He bolts up right on the couch, covered in sweat, his
text: face distorted with pain. His moves are frantic and
text: jerky.
text: He grips his hands over his eyes and stumbles towards the
text: bathroom but can't keep his feet.
text: HIS POV: the room blurs and the floor seems to buckles
text: as he CRASHES onto the hard wood.
text: He writhes in agony, kicking the walls and pressing both
text: hands against his temples as if to stem the pain.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S BATHROOM - MORNING
text: He finally gets it together enough to make it to the
text: bathroom, frantically dumping out drawers and throwing
text: open cabinets.
text: Campbell slumps into the floor. HIS DISTORTED POV: as
text: he paws at a pile of drugs and toiletries that lay
text: sprawled across the floor. His hand finds a
text: pharmaceutical carton and he tears it open with his
dialog: teeth.
text: He pulls the rubber protective tip from a small syringe
text: and plunges into his thigh (which is badly marked and
dialog: scarred from many similar occasions).
text: He pulls out a second syringe and repeats the process.
text: He drags himself the rest of the way into the bathroom
text: and throws up violently into the toilet.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Again, it's night time. Campbell stirs awake. He's been
text: on the floor the whole day. He stands up and washes his
text: mouth out.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Campbell enters the kitchen and opens the refrigerator.
text: Nothing. He slams it closed and checks the cupboard but
text: the cupboard's dry. He closes it as well.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPBELL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Campbell walks out his front door and down the street
text: toward a Chinese Restaurant across the street. He looks
text: haggard. We follow from an ANONYMOUS POV.
scene_heading: INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Campbell sits in the middle of the mostly empty
text: restaurant near the front window, eating his dinner with
text: chopsticks. He does not notice several police cruisers
text: that pass the front of the restaurant with their lights
dialog: on.
text: Again someone watches from across the street. Campbell
text: seems miserable and very much alone.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPBELL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Campbell steps out of the restaurant and is surprised by
text: the sight of an active crime scene in front of his
text: building. Campbell walks up and stands with a CROWD of
text: onlookers. COPS and PARAMEDICS pass this way and that.
text: After a moment, Campbell ducks the police tape and slips
text: unnoticed into the front door of the building.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Campbell ducks another line of tape and into the hallway.
text: LIEUTENANT HOLLIS MACKIE (33, Southern twang and a bad
text: haircut) stands in the hallway talking to some COPS. He
text: sees Campbell.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Hi. Welcome to my crime scene.
dialog: Can help you or are you just
dialog: looking?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (pointing at the
dialog: stairwell)
dialog: I just live here.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (stepping in his path)
dialog: Did you not see the bright
dialog: yellow tape that said 'Do Not
dialog: Cross' on it?
text: Campbell holds up his wallet, showing Hollis his ID.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (weary)
dialog: Can I just go upstairs? I don't
dialog: feel like arguing with you.
text: Hollis looks at the ID for a moment then shouts down the
dialog: hallway.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Emelda!
text: Hollis calls her over with a quick nod.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Got a picture?
text: EMELDA (a young Hispanic cop) hands it over. Hollis
text: hands the picture of Sharon to Campbell.
text: The photo (probably found in Sharon's apartment) is taken
text: at her high school graduation.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know this woman?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Never seen her. What happened?
dialog: She dead?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (suddenly very suspicious)
dialog: We didn't say anything about a
dialog: homicide... Mister...
dialog: (looking at the ID)
dialog: Campbell. Now why would you
dialog: jump to that conclusion?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Oh, I'm just real insightful.
dialog: You got half the block taped off
dialog: and there's a dozen cops in my
dialog: lobby. What conclusion should I
dialog: jump to, that someone stole her
dialog: stereo?
text: Campbell heads toward the stairs.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Wait. Call me if you think of
dialog: anything?
text: Campbell turns back around. Hollis walks over and hands
text: him a card. Campbell turns around and heads up the
dialog: stairs.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Campbell sits on the bed watching the Home Shopping
text: Network holding a half-glass of Jack Daniels. He looks
dialog: miserable.
text: CU on a man's hand holding a faux diamond necklace.
speaker_heading: TV SALESMAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (from the TV)
dialog: This cubic zirconium necklace is
dialog: perfect for her birthday,
dialog: anniversary, or Christmas
dialog: present.
scene_heading: INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Downstairs, a PHOTOGRAPHER flashes shot after shots of
text: Sharon. Off the last flash, the screen flashes entirely
dialog: white.
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO - MORNING
text: A sweeping vista of Chicago in the first light of day.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Campbell eats cereal and rifles through an enormous pile
text: of unopened mail. Bills, junk mail, nothing interesting.
text: He gets to a Fed Ex envelope and tears it open and shakes
text: out the contents. A single 8'x 10' black and white
dialog: photo.
text: CU a photograph of Sharon, last night's victim, sitting
text: alone in a what appears to be a small restaurant - still
dialog: alive.
text: Campbell stands and quickly rummages through an enormous
text: pile of unopened mail and unread newspapers and magazines
text: near the front door, finally pushing the dumping a small
text: table onto the floor. He finds what he's looking for:
text: Another unopened Fed Ex envelope. He rips it open and
text: another black and white photo slips out. It's a picture
text: of a different woman driving alone in a her car. It's
text: taken from a car moving alongside her.
scene_heading: INT. HOLLIS' CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: ON THE CUT: a cell phone RINGS just as Hollis swerves
text: violently through traffic nearly killing himself and
text: twenty others. He's in pursuit of a Honda Accord that
text: just made a quick left. His police radio SQUABBLES
text: almost as loud as the TIRES of his car.
text: After he fishtails around the corner and down shifts,
text: quickly gaining his lost ground on the Honda, he answers
dialog: the phone.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (surprisingly calm)
dialog: Lieutenant Mackie.
text: INTERCUT WITH CAMPBELL'S APARTMENT;
text: Campbell jerks his head away from the receiver, startled
text: by the SCREAMING tires, engine ROAR, and blaring SIRENS.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (loudly over the
dialog: noise)
dialog: This is Joel Campbell. We met
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (driving insanely)
dialog: Campbell. Sure, sure. Our ex-
dialog: F.B.I. friend from apartment
dialog: 805.
dialog: (answering the unasked
dialog: question)
dialog: We did some checking after you
dialog: left last night. What can I do
dialog: for you?
text: Hollis almost runs down four PEDESTRIANS, locking up all
text: four tires just long enough to miss them, then punching
text: the gas again. He doesn't even flinch. Several police
text: cruisers have joined the chase.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (truly perplexed)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (still totally calm)
dialog: Some asshole just jacked a Honda
dialog: two blocks from me.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Well, shit, do you need to call
dialog: me back?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (wrenching the wheel)
dialog: No, I'm fine. You got something
dialog: for me?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (still very loud)
dialog: When'd she die?
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (still driving insanely)
text: Monday night. Three days ago.
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Cause I know who did it.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: And how might you know that?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Because he mailed me a picture
dialog: of her still alive. Got it
dialog: three days ago. Monday morning.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (blown away, almost happy)
dialog: No shit!?
text: Several patrol cars suddenly cut off the Honda and it
text: skids to a halt. Two Asian YOUTHS jump out and flee on
dialog: foot.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Campbell, hold on a sec. Team
dialog: Honda here's on the run.
text: Hollis jumps out of his car and chases one of the kids,
text: still holding his cell phone. After a short sprint,
text: Hollis has closed the gap. He tackles the kid, dropping
text: his cell phone, and the two of them skid along the dirty

scene_heading: INT. DETECTIVE MACKIE'S OFFICE - MORNING
text: Hollis looks at a picture of Sharon (which is now ina

speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: You always open your mail four
dialog: days after you get it?
text: Campbell tosses Hollis the second picture (also in
dialog: plastic).
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: No, sometimes it takes up to two
dialog: weeks.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: I guess that answers any
dialog: question we might of had whether
dialog: the two cases were related. Oh,
dialog: boy, my first serial.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Glad your having fun with this.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Are you kidding? He's sending

speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Exactly. No touchy, no feely.
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: His last known alias is David
dialog: Allen Griffin. We attribute at
dialog: least 11 homicides to him. I
dialog: worked him for three and half
dialog: years. In L.A. All I ever got
text: was a cast on a pair of nine and
dialog: half Nikes.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: In L.A.? What the hell's he
dialog: doing in Chicago?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Killing people, looks like.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (holding up the
dialog: picture)
dialog: He ever come after you before?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: No, he's never sent pictures or
dialog: contacted me directly before.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: So it's not necessarily the same
dialog: guy?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Are you seri-? He sent mea
dialog: picture and then killed her in
dialog: my own fucking building.

dialog: Try to keep the pace, man, this
dialog: is serious.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (whistles)
text: Three and half and a pair of

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

scene_heading: F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - DAY
text: Campbell walks down a long corridor led by MIKE IBBY (44,
dialog: African American).
speaker_heading: IBBY
dialog: I just got off the phone with
dialog: your ex-boss in L.A. He sends
dialog: his best.
text: Campbell doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: IBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: He told me you were a good

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: It's not my job anymore.
speaker_heading: IBBY
dialog: He and I both think maybe it
dialog: should be. We're setting up a

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

text: (young, almost boyish-looking) exits his office.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (ignoring Campbell, to

dialog: We got several sets of prints
text: from the Fed-Ex envelope.
text: Campbell half turns around as he walks out.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: You can run â€˜em but you're going
dialog: to get the delivery boy, the
dialog: receptionist, three guys from
dialog: the warehouse, Santa Clause,
dialog: everyone but him. You're going
dialog: to have to do much better than

scene_heading: INT. FOX PAVILION SHOPPING MALL - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: That's quite alright. You

speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: This new Kodak film stock, it

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: (laughing at herself)

text: Fluorescent lighting.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Do you guys process here, as
dialog: well?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yeah. One hour.
text: Griffin tears open the film and picks up a display camera
text: on the counter. He opens the back of the camera.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: May I?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Sure, but what are you doing?
text: Once the film is loaded, he raises the camera and points
text: it at Ellie.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: I'm going to test it out.
text: He clicks a picture of her. She laughs.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll shoot a few pictures and
dialog: you can process them for me.

scene_heading: INT. POLLY'S OFFICE - DAY

speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: You're a young man, do you plan
dialog: to live on disability your whole

text: Campbell holds out his arms and surveys himself,

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I take 150 milligrams of seconal
dialog: so I can sleep two and half
dialog: hours a night. You want lives
dialog: in my hands? Acebutolol and
dialog: benazepril for blood pressure, I
dialog: self inject migrainol and
dialog: imitrex for migrain -
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: You're simply afraid-
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I go places and forget why I'm
dialog: there. I miss exits on the
dialog: freeway. You want lives in my
dialog: hands? I'm lucky to find my way
text: home from the grocery store.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: You're simply afraid that you'll
dialog: make another bad judgment that
dialog: you won't forgive yourself for
dialog: and you're avoid-
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (almost shouting)
dialog: Absolutely! I'm avoiding that
dialog: situation. No, I don't trust
dialog: myself. Would you?
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Then why do you come here?
dialog: What's the point of these
dialog: sessions? Are you trying to get

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
text: If the next picture that arrives

speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (thinks for a beat)
dialog: Yes. Yes I would.
text: He stands up, unwilling to listen, and heads for the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: POLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't walk out now. This is
dialog: exactly what you want. You have
dialog: to admit that. Right now is the
dialog: time.
text: He slams the door in her face. She throws her note down

scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: FEMALE REPORTER

text: Campbell punches the remote and the screen goes to black.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAY COLONIAL STYLE HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: Campbell (younger, clean-shaven) walks up to the front
text: porch of the house, careful not to be seen or heard.
text: He peers under the blinds into a window. Through the
text: thick leaded glass his POV is distorted. A figure moves
text: in the living room.
text: Several candles provide the only light in the room.
text: Campbell pulls away and looks through another window,
text: trying to get a better idea of what's happening.
text: From the second window he can see a woman bound and
text: gagged. His breath quickens. He stands and kicks the
dialog: front door in and-
text: -WAKES UP SUDDENLY IN HIS LIVING ROOM
text: Campbell sits up in his EZ chair, apparently having
text: fallen asleep in the chair. It's daylight. He looks at
dialog: the clock: 6:40.
scene_heading: EXT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - MORNING
text: Campbell walks down the sidewalk. P OV from someone

text: Campbell heads toward the front door of Polly's building.
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, LOBBY DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS
text: Campbell crosses the polished granite floor of the
text: expansive lobby and heads toward a bank of elevators. He
text: chooses an elevator and enters.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Campbell punches his floor and leans against the wall.
text: The door starts to close but at the last second opens
dialog: again.
text: Griffin steps in. Griffin punches the same floor as
text: Campbell and the two ride in silence, not looking at each
text: other. Campbell yawns. He looks rather haggard froma
dialog: night of little sleep.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Long night?
text: Campbell nods. They ride up the rest of the way in
dialog: silence.
scene_heading: EXT. POLLY'S FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Campbell steps into the hallway and Griffin steps out
text: behind him. Campbell walks down the hallway, Griffin
text: right behind him. He comes to a fork in the hallway and
text: takes the left corridor.
text: Campbell follows. Griffin grins.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Are you following me?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I could ask you the same
dialog: question.
text: They share a small laugh and keep heading down the
text: hallway soon arriving at Polly's door.
text: Campbell slows and for instant it seems as if Griffin is
text: going to stop too but he doesn't. He walks down the hall
text: and Campbell ducks inside.
scene_heading: INT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - LATER
text: Campbell sits fidgeting in a chair across from Polly.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I don't have time to be here but I appreciate what you
dialog: said last week and didn't want you to think that I was
dialog: walking away for the wrong reason.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (she smiles)
dialog: How have the headaches been?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: About the same.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Are you sleeping?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Some.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: How's work?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: It's great. I'm getting so
dialog: popular, I've got murders
dialog: requesting me by name.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Let's talk about that. How are
dialog: you making sense of this man
dialog: following you here? Is ita
dialog: vendetta?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: I don't think vengeance has
dialog: anything to do with it. There's
dialog: a story, a ritual, in this, that
dialog: he follows. Over the years, I
dialog: became part of the story. It
dialog: didn't make sense without me.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: In other words, he missed you.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Odd isn't it?
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: I don't know. Did you miss him?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Well the description you just
dialog: gave could apply to you, don't
dialog: you think?
text: Campbell is taken aback, unsure if he's ready to concede

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

dialog: Vagrancy 1991. I.Q. estimated
dialog: at below eight zero which makes

speaker_heading: IBBY
dialog: Let's pick him up. You got a

scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S CAR - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: The report came in from the

text: everywhere. The lab's running
dialog: them to see if anything
text: interesting turns up.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: It won't. Heâ€™d have been more
dialog: careful than that. If he
dialog: touched anything heâ€™d have wiped
dialog: it clean. Anyone see anything?
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Nope. There was one fun bit,

speaker_heading: GUEST #1
dialog: (pompous )
dialog: On the contrary, Maggie. It

text: Campbell and Diana enter. The clerk doesn't even look

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

speaker_heading: MOTEL CLERK
dialog: (glance at the photo)
dialog: Norton Inglert. Nope.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Would fifty bucks make him more

speaker_heading: MOTEL CLERK
dialog: For fifty bucks I'd tell you

speaker_heading: GUEST #2 (0.S.)

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: BLAM! BLAM!
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. STANISLAW'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: STANISLAW

speaker_heading: HOLLIS

speaker_heading: HOLLIS

speaker_heading: GRIFFIN

speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Ahhhhhhh. Well, I work with
dialog: patients on many different
dialog: issues-
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: I don't like when you say
dialog: "issues'. It just bothers me.
dialog: Don't do that.
dialog: (she's taken aback by
dialog: this)
dialog: Do you think some of your
dialog: patients might pay to come see
dialog: you because you're very pretty?
speaker_heading: POLLY

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

speaker_heading: MENDEL
dialog: I'm his attorney.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: It wasn't an interrogation to

speaker_heading: MENDEL
dialog: No we don't 'gotta' do anything.
dialog: (to the uniforms)
dialog: Escort this man back to his

text: The cops grab Norton by the arms and lift him out his

dialog: No,
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: no, no. He may have seen

dialog: Oh,
speaker_heading: MENDEL

speaker_heading: JESSICA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GRIFFIN

speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Well, I very much doubt that.

speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Only if you dance with me.
speaker_heading: JESSICA

speaker_heading: JESSICA
text: There's no music.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: I'll hum for us.

speaker_heading: JESSICA

dialog: You better give me some money.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: I will.

speaker_heading: GRIFFIN

scene_heading: INT. POLLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: A form moves across the moonlit window. A moment later a

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

text: No answer. Campbell stands up, his eyes still closed.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: (losing patience)
dialog: Can someone grab this light for

text: After another couple seconds, Campbell loses it. He
text: jerks the keyboard of his commuter free from the desk and
text: hurls it overhead into the bank of fluorescents, sending
text: glass and the keyboard crashing back down with a great
text: clatter.
text: Hearing the commotion, Diana runs into his office.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: What the hell was that?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (keyboard in hand)
dialog: Sorry to disturb. Flickering

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: It's working.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: At least this one's outside.
dialog: Where is she sitting? Let's

speaker_heading: DIANA

text: traffic and almost getting squashed. BRAKES squeal and
text: horns BLARE.
text: Hollis looks up and catches a glimpse of Campbell chasing
text: the kid right toward where he is standing. The kid sees
text: Hollis and veers into an alley. Hollis drops his fliers
text: and runs after them.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, TENTH FLOOR - LATER
text: Jessica lies quietly, alone in front of the dying fire,
text: huddled in a dirty sleeping bag to ward off the cold.
text: Reverse to what would be Jessica's POV if she turned
text: around and we see a figure silhouetted against the
text: Chicago skyline.
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY WAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The skater tries to out sprint Hollis but Hollis catches
text: him, tackling him roughly onto the dirty concrete. The
text: skater comes up swinging, kicking, biting, scratching and
text: screaming. Hollis tries to restrain him without hurting
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SKATER
dialog: Fucking cop! Fuck you! I
dialog: didn't do shit! Fuck you! Let
dialog: go.
text: Campbell catches up, looks around to make sure no one's
text: looking, and then open-hand slaps the shit out of the
dialog: kid.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: If you don't help me, right now,
text: a man is going to wrap piano
text: wire around her neck so
text: viciously it will almost sever
text: her head.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, TENTH FLOOR - LATER
text: Jessica sits by the fire. Her face tightens as she
text: senses someone behind her but she doesn't turn around.
text: The figure approaches the firelight revealing that it is
text: in fact Griffin. Though she is clearly nervous, she
text: tries not to let it show.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Hi. What are you listening to?
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: Bauhaus.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Bela Logosi's dead. Bela
dialog: Logosi's dead.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: No way. You know it? Here, let
dialog: me turn it up.
text: She sits up and adjusts the volume, casually picking up
text: the jambox in the process and then SMACKING it into
text: Griffin's face. She stands up and sprints through the
dialog: darkness.
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: The skater now leads Hollis and Campbell on a full-run
text: back to the abandoned building.
text: As they cross the main street near the Starbucks, Hollis
dialog: radios for back up.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, TENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Griffin now runs through the darkness in the direction
text: Jessica had gone. She makes it across the top floor and
text: to the stairwell.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
text: It's pitch black and only shapes can be seen. HEAVY
text: BREATHING and FOOTSTEPS fill the empty space.
text: After making it down two flights of stairs, she comes to
text: a closed door (which, knowing the building, she had
text: expected) and has to run across another abandoned floor.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, SEVENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Unlike the top floor, however, the kids haven't kicked
dialog: down all the interior walls of this floor. Griffin
text: closes in right behind her.
text: She knows she can't out run him so she makes the
text: dangerous decision to duck into one of the old offices,
text: initiating a deadly game of hide and seek.
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: The skater, Campbell, and Hollis sprint through traffic.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, SEVENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Jessica has managed to crawl from office space to office
text: space, apparently unseen by Griffin.
text: Several times she has to make the horrifying leap from
text: behind one wall to another exposing herself briefly in
text: the moonlight as she inches her way toward the other
dialog: stairwell.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
text: Downstairs, the skater leads Campbell and Hollis under
text: the chain-link fence and into the building.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
text: Campbell, Hollis, and the kid run up the stairs.
speaker_heading: SKATER
dialog: (breathing hard)
text: She sleeps on the top floor.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, SEVENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Campbell, Hollis and the kid burst through the stairwell
text: and onto the seventh floor (where we last saw Jessica).
text: A shadow passes the light ahead. Campbell stops short
text: and puts a hand on the kid's chest.
text: Hollis immediately pulls the boy back into the stairwell.
text: Campbell moves quickly, gun drawn, down the main corridor
text: toward the direction he saw the shadow.
text: He fires FIVE SHOTS instinctively as Griffin leaps from
text: the darkness and into the stairwell.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
text: In the stairwell, Griffin slams his weight into a steel
text: door (leading down to the next floor) but the door won't
text: budge. After a couple tries he turns and heads up the
dialog: stairs.
text: Griffin runs up the stairs. Campbell pounds the metal
text: stairs below him.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, TENTH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Griffin reaches the top floor and crosses as fast as he
text: can toward another stairwell. Campbell kicks the door
text: open and takes FOUR MORE SHOTS at his figure. Again,
text: Griffin goes untouched. He makes it to the other
text: stairwell and heads toward the roof.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
text: Dozens of other cops pour into the building. Two police
text: helicopters hover over the building, spotlights sweeping
text: the brick and broken windows.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING, ROOF - CONTINUOUS
text: Griffin runs onto the roof. Shortly thereafter, the
text: police helicopters have him in their spotlights.
text: Campbell bursts onto the roof and runs full-sprint toward
text: Griffin, shooting insanely without breaking stride.
text: Griffin spots a smaller office building below; he sprints
text: and leaps from the roof over an alley way, tumbling as he
text: lands two stories below.
text: Campbell follows him dangerously across the alley.
text: At the other end of the building, Griffin jumps again,
text: this time to an even lower building.
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: A wide shot of storefronts as Griffin hurdles from one
text: rooftop to the next as he finally eludes the searchlights
text: and disappears between buildings, Campbell right on his
dialog: heels
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
text: We pick up Griffin mid-air a second before he lands feet
text: first on the exploding windshield of a truck.
text: He tumbles off and steals down the alley. Campbell jumps
text: across the alleyway to a nearby fire escape and quickly
text: jumps from level to level, until he reaches bottom level.
text: He jumps into the alley and chases Griffin.
scene_heading: OBVIOUSLY, THIS WILL ALL DEPEND ON LOCATION AND STORY
text: BOARDS. THE GENERAL POINT IS TO INCLUDE CAMPBELL IN THE
text: CHASE ALL THE WAY UNTIL THE GAS STATION.
text: SIRENS wail from all directions as Griffin slinks down
text: another alley. He comes upon a beat-up old Lincoln. He
text: picks up a metal trashcan and smashes out a window.
text: Campbell rounds the corner, way down the block, in time
text: to see the lights come on and hear the car start. He
text: picks up his pace, sprinting as fast as he can. Halfway
text: down the alley, he misses a step and slips to one knee.
text: He holds his heart and shakes his left arm. He struggles
text: to shake it off and pick back up the chase.
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Lincoln eases onto a nearby street, but within
text: seconds several cops cars are on his ass.
text: Campbell runs out of the alley, still chasing him on foot
text: and almost gets hit by a police cruiser. He slams his
text: fist on the hood and signals the startled COP to get out
text: of his car. Campbell holds up his badge.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Special Agent Campbell. I head
dialog: the FBI/Chicago PD task force
dialog: which means I rank you which
dialog: means I'm taking your car.
text: Griffin punches the accelerator, rounds a corner and
text: comes face to face with a road block which he simply
text: BLASTS through, sending wooden saw-horses and COPS
text: flying. A moment later, Campbell races through the same
dialog: intersection.
text: Griffin speeds another block before coming up on stopped
text: traffic at a red light, Campbell closing in behind him.
text: Griffin jumps a median and passes the stopped cars in the
text: oncoming lanes.
text: He races across the busy intersection and almost makes it
text: through but gets clipped by a pick-up truck and loses
text: control, jumping the sidewalk and SMASHING through a
text: glass and plastic bus-stop before side-swiping a row of
text: three gas pumps.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS
text: Three mushrooms of gas spray out of the ground showering
text: Griffin's Lincoln and drenching the parking lot.
text: Griffin sits, calmly waiting as cop cars converge from
text: every direction. Campbell gets out of his car and draws
text: his weapon. Several Cops do the same.
text: He waits. More and more cops pull up.
text: He calmly shifts the car in gear and tosses a Zippo
text: lighter out the window.
text: The entire area explodes.
text: A block away, Griffin races down the side street and
dialog: disappears.
scene_heading: EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT
text: Aerial shot of the wreckage. The gas station still
text: burns. Charred cop cars. Dozens of other cops parked
text: here and there. Ambulances. The shot tracks two blocks
text: revealing other car accidents and the abandoned building
text: which is still swarming with cops. The shot lowers and
text: closes in on a seventh-story window. Closer and closer--
scene_heading: DISSOLVE THROUGH THE WINDOW- -
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING, SEVENTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: A DOZEN or so COPS and FEDS work the crime scene.
text: Campbell crouches next to Jessica's bloody body, her face
text: etched with death.
text: He looks into her eyes for a long moment then lowers his
text: head in a gesture that suggests a very deep surrender.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Campbell's apartment looks worse than usual. It's dark
text: dusty and it looks as if it has been ransacked. He is
text: nowhere to be seen, but Ibby's voice can be heard through
text: the door.
speaker_heading: IBBY (0.S.)
dialog: Campbell!? You okay? Open the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
text: Ibby and Mitch stand in the hallway outside Campbell's
text: apartment. Ibby bangs on the door loudly. He gives up
text: and turns to Mitch.
speaker_heading: IBBY
dialog: Open it.
text: Mitch pulls a small electronic device from his pocket and
text: kneels in front of the door. The device looks something
text: like a handheld screwdriver with a modified tip. Mitch
text: inserts the tip into the keyhole and WHIRS the machine to
text: life. There's a short RATTLE before the knob turns and
text: Ibby pushes the door open.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Ibby and Mitch enter the dank apartment, concerned by its
dialog: appearance.
text: Ibby opens the bedroom door and sees Campbell's legs
text: hanging out of the bathroom floor. He and Mitch rush
dialog: over.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Ibby leans over Campbell and tries to rouse him. He is
text: pale white and the bathroom is a mess. Ibby checks his
dialog: pulse.
speaker_heading: IBBY
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Jesus, he's freezing cold. Call
dialog: a paramedic!
text: But just then Campbell rouses awake. Campbell presses
text: his hand to his head.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (wheezing)
text: Ibby, a paramedic shows up at
dialog: this apartment I swear to you I
dialog: will shoot them.
text: He shakes Ibby's arm loose from his clothes and sits up
text: against the bathroom counter. Campbell tries to stand
text: but immediately slumps back to one knee, gasping for
text: breath. His eyes go wide with confusion and pain.
speaker_heading: IBBY
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Call them!
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Campbell lies in bed, semi-conscious. Ibby and a DOCTOR
text: hover over him. The doctor holds a small rubber toy in
text: the shape of a martian.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: The blood pressure got too great
dialog: for one of the veins in your
text: heart and it collapsed. Sounds
dialog: worse than it is. It'll bea
dialog: minor procedure called an angio-
dialog: plasty. We'll stick a small

dialog: the collapsed vein and BOOP! We
dialog: open it back up.
text: She squeezes the toy causing it's martian head to triple
text: in size and its eyes and ears to pop out cartoonishly.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (to Mitch)
dialog: Itâ€™s out of the question. I'll
dialog: have to put it off.
speaker_heading: IBBY
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Absolutely not. Your heart
dialog: muscle isn't getting the oxygen
text: it needs. The tissue is dying.
dialog: I want to go into the O.R. r

dialog: here, another week of rest and
dialog: then you can start back easy, a

dialog: (squeezes the toy again)
dialog: Trust me.
text: Campbell closes his eyes, overwhelmed by a sense of
dialog: futility.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE DISTRICT - DAY
text: Outside the police district office, a crowd
scene_heading: of BYSTANDERS, REPORTERS, and PHOTOGRAPHERS
text: makeshift police barricade between the door
dialog: van.
text: A moment later four COPS exit the building,
text: Norton who wears an orange prison jumpsuit.
dialog: of hundreds
dialog: crowd a
dialog: and a police
dialog: escorting
text: COPS work the barricade trying to hold everyone back as
text: they all surge forward to get a look or ask a question.
text: Hollis takes in the scene with disgust.
text: POP! POP! POP! Suddenly everyone hits the ground and
text: scatters as three shots are fired from close range.
text: Norton slumps to the ground bleeding from two bullet
text: wounds. One cop has also been hit.
text: The rest of the cops draw their weapons on an OLDER MAN
text: in light blue Sansa-belt slacks and a golf shirt who
text: stands holding a small-caliber revolver. The COPS
text: wrestle him to the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE DISTRICT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Norton lays on a stretcher next to an ambulance. The
text: area is chaotic. One PARAMEDIC pumps his chest; another
text: PARAMEDIC has an oxygen mask over his mouth.
text: Hollis hovers next to the paramedics, cringing at his
text: terrible state. After a few seconds, Norton stirs and
text: cries out in pain.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: (to her co-worker)
dialog: Heâ€™s conscious!

dialog: Talk to him! Try to keep him

speaker_heading: HOLLIS

speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: Just talk to him! Say the

speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (frazzled)
dialog: Hey! Norton! Hang in there,
dialog: man. We're going to the
dialog: hospital right now! You're

speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: His blood pressure's dropping!
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: It's not my fault!
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: I wasn't talking to you!
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
dialog: (back to Norton, as if
dialog: to a child)
dialog: What else, what else? Let's
dialog: see... I had a retarded cousin
dialog: once. Bet you didn't know that,
dialog: did you? He died though.
text: The paramedics work faster to try to save him but Hollis
text: senses that it's over and stops talking.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Campbell watches a special report on the local news
text: broadcast from outside the station.
speaker_heading: FEMALE REPORTER
text: The gunman is reported to be
dialog: Padgett Weaver, the recent
dialog: murder victim's sixty-six year-
dialog: old father who had just arrived
dialog: in Chicago. When asked why he
dialog: didn't trust the justice system
dialog: to do its job, Mr. Weaver said
dialog: simply, "I am an old man and I
dialog: don't have time for that crap."
text: Campbell sighs and tosses his hands in the air at this.
text: Just then, Polly enters the room tentatively.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (pleased to see her)
dialog: You didn't have to come here.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Something tells me you wouldn't
dialog: have come to me.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (pointing at the TV)
dialog: D'you see they shot my witness?
text: It's like someone's making up
dialog: new ways to be ridiculous.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Maybe you should get your nerves
text: all bound up in a knot about it.
dialog: (clicks off the TV)
dialog: I can't believe they let you
dialog: watch that thing.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: How else am I going to know
dialog: what's going on? Ibby's got

speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: When's the last time you ate?
dialog: Are you allowed to eat anything
dialog: besides the shit they serve
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Probably not but let's order

speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: How's Thai? My favorite joint

scene_heading: INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS, GARAGE AREA - MORNING
text: Mitch, Diana, and SEVERAL FORENSIC TECHS, stand under a
text: dirty LATE MODEL SEDAN that has been lifted on a
text: mechanic's lift. All of the doors are wide open.
text: The back window has been shot out, and the front fender
text: and grill are damaged. The car appears to be the one
dialog: Hollis and Campbell chased a few nights ago.
speaker_heading: FORENSIC TECH
dialog: We found two of the slugs
text: imbedded in the frame.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: No other physical evidence?
speaker_heading: FORENSIC TECH
dialog: Not yet, but give a guy a break.
dialog: This thing was in the river

text: Just then, Campbell's secretary comes into the room
text: holding an 8' X 10' envelope.
scene_heading: CAMPBELL'S SECRETARY
dialog: Excuse me, Agent Casper? This
dialog: came for Agent Campbell and I
dialog: thought you-
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: How'd it get here!?
scene_heading: CAMPBELL'S SECRETARY
dialog: (clueless)
dialog: It just came in the regular

text: Mitch snatches the envelope from her hands and waves at
dialog: Diana.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: (heading out of the room)
dialog: Let's do it. Get Mackie on the

scene_heading: INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS, PRESS ROOM - MORNING
text: Again, Hollis addresses a battery of reporters.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Good morning and thanks for your

text: The bank of REPORTERS all BLURT questions at once.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
text: Campbell sits in bed, looking totally wrecked. He watches
text: Hollis finish his address on TV.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (calming the
dialog: reporters)
dialog: No, no, no. I'm not answering
dialog: questions today. I'm only here
dialog: to pass on the photograph and
dialog: request that you continue to
dialog: help us in this investigation.
dialog: That is all.
text: Campbell sits with no noticeable expression of emotion on
text: his face. He seems truly defeated.
speaker_heading: ANCHORWOMAN (0.S.)
dialog: Police Detective Hollis Mackie
dialog: informing us that this terrible
dialog: game will continue today. Here
text: is a photograph of the killer's
dialog: latest target.
text: Campbell suddenly reacts strongly to the television. He
text: half stands up, almost stumbling out of bed. He pulls
text: the IV from his arm, still not taking his eyes off the
text: TV. We still can't see what he sees, though his reaction
dialog: makes us wish we could.
scene_heading: INT. HOLLIS' CAR/MITCH'S OFFICE - DAY - INTERCUT
text: Hollis races along talking to Mitch on the cell phone.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Mitch Casper.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: It's Mackie. I'm looking for
dialog: Campbell. He's not at the
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: Yeah, they just called to inform
dialog: us of that very fact. Nobody
dialog: knows where he is.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Maybe he's at home? I'1l drop
dialog: by there.
speaker_heading: MITCH
dialog: There's really no way to tell,
dialog: is there?
text: He hangs up the phone and wheels the car around the
text: opposite direction.
scene_heading: INT. HOLLIS' CAR - DAY
text: Hollis screeches to a halt outside of Campbell's
text: apartment, leaving his car double-parked. He runs up to
text: the front door.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
text: Hollis bangs loudly on Campbell's door.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Hey! Open the Goddamn door!
dialog: Hey! Campbell? You okay?!
text: He sighs, steps away from the door and kicks it open.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Hollis enters Campbell's stuffy, messy apartment.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Jesus, man. You gotta get a
dialog: maid. Campbell?!
text: Hollis quickly searches the kitchen (small and visible
text: from the living room) and the bedroom (he opens the door
text: and can tell it's empty).
text: Hollis tries one last door. It's locked. He knocks
text: loudly.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Campbell?
text: He tries the door again, jiggling the knob very hard. It
text: doesn't budge.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: This is becoming a habit.
text: WHACK! He kicks the door in. The room appears to be a
text: walk-in closet. Inside, cardboard boxes are stacked from
dialog: floor to ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S CLOSET - CONTINUOUS
text: Hollis steps inside the room, curiously. He opens a box
text: and pulls out some file-folders - crime scene photos,
text: reports, etc. Griffin's name is everywhere.
text: These are obviously Campbell's personal files on Griffin.
text: Hollis notices several burned down candles. He turns
text: around and sees a thin white sheet covering one wall of
dialog: the closet.
text: He lifts the sheet and tries to peer under. A look of
text: confusion washes over his face. He yanks the sheet from
text: the wall, sending tacks flying.
text: The sheet drops down to reveal the enormous photographic
dialog: collage we saw in the opening credits. Its true scope
text: and detail are revealed for the first time.
text: It spans the entire wall and looks as if it were
text: methodically, obsessively pasted together.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: (awe-struck)
dialog: What the fuck?
text: He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a folded
text: white piece of paper. He unfolds the paper and looks at
dialog: it:
text: It is a flier with a photo of the next victim. He holds
text: it close to the collage to reveal that it is THE WOMAN IN
text: THE COLLAGE.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, Campbell, what is this?
text: His eyes dart around the collage. He reads the newspaper
text: clippings: INQUIRY CLEARS AGENT OF NEGLIGENCE. He sees
text: Campbell's name in all of the articles. Griffin's name
dialog: is in several as well. The name 'Lisa Alexander' is also
text: everywhere. The birthday card reads "Love, Lisa". He
text: scans quickly trying to make sense of what he's seeing.
scene_heading: DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO NINETEEN. AGENT BEGINS INDEFINITE
text: LEAVE.
text: Hollis glances at something that clicks. It's a
text: photograph of a cemetery. A closer shot of a headstone
text: shows the engraving to be 'Lisa Alexander. 1964-1999'
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Hollis steps out of the closet and toward the front door.
text: On the TV there is a picture of Lisa Alexander.
speaker_heading: CNN REPORTER (0.S.)
dialog: ...at this time police have not

dialog: have reason to believe...
scene_heading: INT. CAMPBELL'S CAR - AFTERNOON
text: Campbell drives through light traffic. He rounds a
text: corner and we see the CEMETERY from the photograph
text: through the windshield.
text: Campbell pulls into the deserted parking lot and steps
dialog: out.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPBELL'S BUILDING - AFTERNOON
text: Hollis runs down the front stairs. He hops in his car.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - AFTERNOON
text: Campbell walks through the graveyard, unhurried but
dialog: deliberate.
text: He rounds a corner and stops short. Griffin sits on the
dialog: grave we saw Campbell leaning against earlier.
text: Campbell draws his gun and walks slowly over. Griffin
text: notices him.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Hey Campbell! How's your heart,
dialog: pal? Here have a beer, it'll
dialog: make it feel better. Here.
text: Griffin tosses him a beer but Campbell side-steps it,
text: letting drop to the ground. He loads a shell into the
text: chamber of his 9mm, still trying to make sense of the
dialog: situation.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me something, Campbell.
dialog: Did you move two thousand miles
dialog: to live near this woman's grave?
text: Griffin takes a drink out of his beer. Campbell tightens
text: his grip on the pistol. He takes dead aim at Griffin's
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's true, isn't it? Man, you
dialog: gotta get out more. I mean is
dialog: this a satisfying relationship?
dialog: (picks a flower and

dialog: She loves me... She's
dialog: decomposing... She loves me...
text: she's decomposing.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (lowering the gun)
dialog: Why don't we talk about what
dialog: we're doing here. Is this it?
dialog: You here to give yourself up?
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Why didn't you ever tell anyone
dialog: you laying pipe with her? Just
dialog: cause she was married?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (losing patience)
dialog: We don't seem to be
dialog: communicating. Let me be clear
dialog: with you, I have no problem with
dialog: shooting you dead where you sit.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Well you do have one problem.
text: Griffin tosses his beer and fishes a business card out of
text: his pocket. Campbell quickly raises his gun. Griffin
text: doesn't even flinch.
text: Careful to keep his gun trained on Griffin, Campbell
text: reaches and takes the card. It reads: Polly Beilman,
text: Ph.D. It is badly stained with blood. Campbell winces.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: If I'm dead, your friend Polly
text: plans to meet a rather gruesome
dialog: fate involving candlelight and
text: quite a large pool of kerosene.
text: Campbell looks at him for a long moment, weighing his
dialog: options.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know something about
dialog: attractive women burning alive,
dialog: don't you? Tell me, what was it
dialog: like? Could you smell her flesh
dialog: burning?
text: Campbell flicks Polly's business card toward Griffin, it
text: flutters away and lands in the grass.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: You've already killed her.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: C'mon. You know me better than
dialog: that. That's not even her
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Take me to see her then.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: Oh, I don't know about that.
dialog: Let's just sit here and talk for
dialog: a little while.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon, take it. I trust you. I
dialog: just need to see that she's all

dialog: You look older since you were in

text: Campbell turns to look at him.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Relax, I never hurt him. I just
dialog: used to go visit him in the
text: home. Towards the end, he
dialog: couldn't tell the difference
dialog: between us so I just told him I
dialog: was you. It made him happy,
dialog: that you were there.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Listen to me, Griffin. What do
dialog: you want? I want you to think
dialog: about what you need. I can try
dialog: to get you that and we can make

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (taken aback by his tone)
dialog: I'm not much in a position to be
dialog: a judge right now, but, I think
dialog: words like evil are just words
dialog: people use to keep from having

dialog: You do what your driven to do.

dialog: I said look at me when I'm

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I'm listening. What? What do
dialog: you have to say? I'm listening.
dialog: Go ahead!

speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: I forgot what I was going to

text: He sees a figure move in the living room.
text: Campbell pulls away and looks through another window,
text: trying to get a better idea of what's happening.
text: From the second window he can see a woman bound and
text: gagged. His breath quickens.
text: He stands and kicks the front door.
scene_heading: INT. GRAY COLONIAL STYLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK
text: Campbell bursts into the front room. He hears a loud
text: commotion in the next-room and rounds the corner just in
text: time to see a man duck into a back hallway, dumping a

text: but it thumps harmlessly into the wall.
text: Campbell turns his attention to LISA ALEXANDER who sits
text: bound and gagged in a chair - and we realize that she is
dialog: the same woman in the fire and this is the room that was
text: on fire. He runs quickly to her and rips the tape off
text: her mouth.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Are you hurt?
text: Paralyzed with fear, she only manages to shake her head.

speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You're going to be all right.

text: Campbell bursts through the back door and flies down the

text: His POV: far ahead a figure races through the shadows.
text: He runs down the alley, leaving the house further and
text: further behind. After another few seconds, he hears a
text: sharp CLAPPING sound.
text: He wheels around to see the smoke rising up from inside
text: the house he was just in. He sprints back toward the
text: house and up the staircase. He kicks in the back door,

scene_heading: INT. BURNING HOUSE, BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK

text: dances lightly around the room. Polly whimpers in fear.
text: The music fades down and Griffin slows his dance moves
dialog: slightly.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: (to Polly)
dialog: I don't know how you can just
dialog: sit there with music like this.
dialog: Such a waste.
text: Campbell puts one hand to his head, shielding his eyes,
text: and with the other, grasps at his inside pocket, looking
text: for his syringes. Griffin has removed the tape from
text: Polly's mouth.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Who-hoo?
text: Campbell looks up and sees Griffin holding Campbell's
text: leather medicine pouch in one hand and his gun in the
dialog: other.
text: Griffin walks over and picks him up by his jacket and
text: sits him in a wooden chair (outside the perimeter of the
text: kerosene pool). Campbell is too disoriented to resist.
text: On a nearby table, Griffin clicks on a bright Halogen
text: desk lamp and pushes right into Campbell's face. He
text: flinches from the light. Griffin flips the light away
text: from Campbell and then back, away and then back,
dialog: repeatedly.
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
dialog: That hurts, doesn't it? They say

speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Noooooo!
speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: No, no, no, no, Campbell. I'm

speaker_heading: GRIFFIN
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL

dialog: I said thank you.
text: Griffin leans in closer and Campbell suddenly jabs the

text: UNDERWATER CAMERA - as Griffin breaks the surface and the
text: flames are immediately snuffed out.
text: Back on the surface, Campbell and Polly desperately scan
text: the water around them, waiting for him to resurface. On
text: the bank, several COPS have pulled their weapons, also
text: waiting for him to resurface. For a long moment, there
text: is no sign of him. Campbell tries to swim toward the
text: bank. TWO COPS dive in and help. They take Polly from
text: him just as Campbell sees Griffin's body bob to the
text: surface nearby, motionless.
text: The cops fish Polly out of the water, but Campbell can't
text: help but make sure Griffin is really dead. He swims a
text: few feet toward the body, which is still face down.
text: Campbell reaches tentatively for Griffin's shoulder and
text: rolls him over revealing that his face has been horribly
text: burned beyond recognition and that he is in fact, dead.
text: Campbell's voice is heard.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (V.O.)
dialog: Like I said, it's never that
dialog: easy. The best we can do is
dialog: hope he fucks up and do what we
dialog: can to be there when he does.
text: Campbell turns and swims toward the bank.

speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: What's your point?
text: They reach her door and she unlocks three dead-bolts.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: I'm just saying you still seem a
dialog: little paranoid. Maybe you
dialog: should see someone about this.
text: She opens the door and they step inside.
scene_heading: INT. POLLY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: They step inside and are greeted by an enormous
text: Rottweiler. Campbell pats its big head roughly.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: (playfully annoyed)
dialog: I am not paranoid.
text: She says as she disarms the security system.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: No definitely not.
text: Campbell walks through the rest of the apartment, turning
text: on all the lights and checking all the rooms.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Okay, so I have a few issues
dialog: with personal security. But I
dialog: think that's pretty
dialog: understandable, given the
dialog: circumstances, don't you?
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: (calling from down the
dialog: hall)
dialog: Definitely.
text: He walks back into the living room.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
text: Well, all clear. Once again.
text: She walks him to the door.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Thanks, Campbell.

dialog: you think?
speaker_heading: POLLY

scene_heading: EXT. POLLY'S BUILDING, CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

text: After a moment he hears the bolts and chains again. The
text: door opens and Polly steps into the hallway.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Actually, I thought of something
dialog: else you can do for me.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: What's that?
text: The elevator door pings open.
speaker_heading: POLLY
dialog: Have dinner with me. I hate
text: eating alone.
speaker_heading: CAMPBELL
dialog: Me too.
text: He starts to walk toward her.
text: They go back inside and the bolts and chains start
text: banging and clicking again.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
dialog:
