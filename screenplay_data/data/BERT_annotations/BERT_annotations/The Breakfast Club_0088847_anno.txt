dialog: 60062. Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept
dialog: the fact that we had to sacrifice a
dialog: whole Saturday in detention for
dialog: whatever it was that we did wrong,
dialog: what we did was wrong. But we think
dialog: you're crazy to make us write this
dialog: essay telling you who we think we
dialog: are, what do you care? You see us
dialog: as you want to see us...in the
dialog: simplest terms and the most
dialog: convenient definitions. You see us
text: as a brain, an athelete, a basket
text: case, a princess and a criminal.
dialog: Correct? That's the way we saw each

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I can't believe you can't get me
dialog: out of this...I mean it's so absurd
dialog: I have to be here on a Saturday!
dialog: It's not like I'm a defective or

speaker_heading: CLAIRE'S FATHER
dialog: I'll make it up to you...Honey,

speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: Last...
speaker_heading: BRIAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Well get in there and use the time
dialog: to your advantage...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Mom, we're not supposed to study; we
dialog: just have to sit there and do
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: BRIAN'S MOTHER
dialog: Well mister you figure out a way to

scene_heading: BRIAN'S LITTLE SISTER

dialog: stop walking.
text: The car slams on its breaks directly in front of him.
text: Bender gets out of the frame. Out of the car steps

scene_heading: 6. INT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: There are six tables in two rows of three.
text: Claire is sitting at the front table. Brian comes in
text: and sits at the table behind her.
text: Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire
text: at the front table. She shrugs and he sits there.
text: In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout
text: desk and takes a few things in the process.
text: He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to
text: the table on the opposite side of the Library. Brian
text: reluctantly gets up and moves.
text: Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his
text: feet up.
text: Allison walks in. She walks all the way around the
text: library and sits in the back corner table, just behind
dialog: Brian.
text: Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.
text: Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.
text: Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher. He holds a stack
text: of papers in his left hand. He addresses the group with
dialog: such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Well...well. Here we are! I want
dialog: to congradulate you for being on
dialog: time...
text: Claire raises her hand.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Excuse me, sir? I think there's
dialog: been a mistake. I know it's
dialog: detention, but...um...I don't think
dialog: I belong in here...
text: Vernon doesn't care. He just continues to talk.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: It is now seven-oh-six. You have
dialog: exactly eight hours and fifty-four
dialog: minutes to think about why you're
dialog: here. To ponder the error of your
dialog: ways...
text: Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his
text: mouth again.
text: Claire looks like she is going to gag.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: ...and you may not talk. You will
dialog: not move from these seats.
text: He glances up at Bender and points at him.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: ...and you...
text: Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: ...will not sleep. Alright people,
dialog: we're gonna try something a little
dialog: different today. We are going to
dialog: write an essay--of no less than a
dialog: thousand words--describing to me
dialog: who you think you are.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Is this a test?
text: Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice
dialog: of Bender.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: And when I say essay...I mean essay.
dialog: I do not mean a single word repeated
dialog: a thousand times. Is that clear Mr.
dialog: Bender?
text: Bender looks up.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Crystal...
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Good. Maybe you'll learn a little
dialog: something about yourself. Maybe
dialog: you'll even--decide whether or not
dialog: you care to return.
text: Brian raises his hand and then stands.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You know, I can answer that right
dialog: now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.
dialog: 'cause...
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Sit down Johnson...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Thank you sir...
text: He sits.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: My office...
dialog: Vernon points.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: ...is right across that hall. Any
dialog: monkey business is ill-advised...
text: He looks around at them.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: ...any questions?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Yeah...I got a question.
text: Vernon looks at him suspiciously.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Does Barry Manilow know you raid his
dialog: wardrobe?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I'll give you the answer to that
dialog: question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.
dialog: Don't mess with the bull young man,
dialog: you'll get the horns.
text: Vernon leaves.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: That man...is a brownie hound...
text: Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud
text: snapping sound. Brian turns and looks and it is
text: Allison, biting her nails.
text: Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look. Everyone is
text: looking now. Allison notices them looking at her.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You keep eating your hand and you're
dialog: not gonna be hungry for lunch...
text: Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I've seen you before, you know...
text: We see Vernon look out from his office.
text: We see Brian playing with his pen.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (quietly to himself)
dialog: Who do I think I am? Who are you?
dialog: Who are you?
text: He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top
text: under his upper lip.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I am a walrus...
text: Bender looks at him in utter confusion. Brian notices
text: this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--
dialog: embarrassed.
text: Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the
text: same time. They both notice this. Brian stops removing
text: his jacket.
text: Bender takes his all the way off. Brian rubs his hands
text: together and pretends to be cold. He pulls his jacket
text: back on. He turns and looks at Bender who is still
text: staring at him.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It's the shits, huh?
text: Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable
dialog: laugh.
text: Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper. He
text: throws it at Claire. It misses and goes over Claire's
dialog: head.
text: Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore
dialog: Bender.
text: Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a
text: song. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: I can't believe this is really
dialog: happening to me...
text: Bender stops "singing" abruptly.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Oh, shit! What're we s'posed to do
dialog: if we hafta take a piss?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: If you gotta go...
text: We hear Bender unzip his fly.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You gotta go!

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: ANDREW

text: before the first drop hits the
dialog: floor!
text: Bender gasps mockingly.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You're pretty sexy when you get
dialog: angry...grrr!
text: He turns to Brian.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Hey, homeboy...
text: Brian points at himself with his pen.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: ...why don't you go close that door.
dialog: We'll get the prom queen--
dialog: impregnated!
text: Claire turns and glares at him.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hey!
text: Bender ignores him.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: If I lose my temper, you're totalled

speaker_heading: BENDER

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Well hey Sporto! What'd you do to

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Uh, excuse me, fellas? I think we
dialog: should just write our papers...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (to Bender)
dialog: Look, just because you live in here
dialog: doesn't give you the right to be a
dialog: pain in the ass...so knock it off!
text: Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: It's a free country...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to Andrew)
dialog: He's just doing it to get a rise out
dialog: of you! Just ignore him...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (to Claire)
dialog: Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if
dialog: you tried!
text: Claire rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: BENDER

text: on it.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: What do you say we close that door.
dialog: We can't have any kind of party
dialog: with Vernon checking us out every
dialog: few seconds.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, you know the door's s'posed to

speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: So why don't you just shut up!
dialog: There's four other people in here

speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: God, you can count. See! I knew

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Who the hell are you to judge
dialog: anybody anyway?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Really...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You know, Bender...you don't even
dialog: count. I mean if you disappeared
dialog: forever it wouldn't make any
dialog: difference. You may as well not
dialog: even exist at this school.
text: Bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment
text: before speaking. He doesn't let his emotions out,
dialog: however.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Well...I'll just run right out and
text: join the wrestling team.
text: Andrew and Claire look at each other and laugh at
dialog: Bender.
speaker_heading: BENDER

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No, they wouldn't take you.
speaker_heading: BENDER

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You know why guys like you knock

speaker_heading: BENDER

speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (with mock enthusiasm)
dialog: Oh, God! You ritchies are so smart,
dialog: that's exactly why I'm not heavy in
dialog: activities!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE

text: Brian feels left out.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (to no one imparticular)
dialog: I'm in the math club...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: See you're afraid that they won't

speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Hey...Cherry...do you belong to the
dialog: physics club?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That's an academic club...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: So...academic clubs aren't the same
dialog: as other kinds of clubs.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Oh, but to dorks like him...
text: Bender points at Brian.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: ...they are.
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: What do you guys do in your club?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: In physics, um, we ah, we talk about
dialog: physics...about properties of physics.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: So it's sorta social...demented and
dialog: sad, but social. Right?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, well, I guess you could
dialog: consider it a social situation. I
dialog: mean there are other children in my

speaker_heading: BENDER

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: And, uh, I didn't have any shoes.
dialog: So I had to borrow my dad's. It
dialog: was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't
dialog: like me to wear other people's

dialog: cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana...
dialog: He got high once and you know, he
dialog: started eating like really weird
dialog: foods. And uh, and then he just
dialog: felt like he didn't belong anywhere.
dialog: You know, kinda like, you know

speaker_heading: BENDER

dialog: Oh and wouldn't that be a bite...
text: Bender lets out a moan of fake agony.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Missing a whole wrestling meet!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well you wouldn't know anything
dialog: about it, faggot! You never competed
dialog: in your whole life!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (with mock hurt)
dialog: Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside
dialog: because of it. I have such a deep
dialog: admiration for guys that roll around
dialog: on the floor with other guys!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Ahhh...you'd never miss it. You
dialog: don't have any goals.
speaker_heading: BENDER

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BENDER

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: Shut up!
text: They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender
text: quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and
text: Andrew. He folds his hands on the table.
text: Vernon goes back into his office. Bender laughs and
text: gets up. He starts walking towards the double doors
text: that separate the library from the hallway.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You know there's not s'posed to be
dialog: any monkey business!
text: Bender turns and points at Brian.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (in a stern voice)
dialog: Young man...have you finished your
dialog: paper?
text: Bender turns back away and goes to the door. He looks
text: around cautiously and removes a screw from the door.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Drop dead, I hope!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 9. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 10. INT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: Brian looks up. Bender is messing with the door to the

speaker_heading: BRIAN

dialog: be toyed with.
text: The door slams shut. Bender runs back to his seat.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's very funny, come on, fix it!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You should really fix that!
speaker_heading: BENDER

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 11. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

speaker_heading: BENDER (OS)
dialog: I've been here before, I know what
dialog: I'm doing!
speaker_heading: ANDREW (OS)
dialog: No! Fix the door, get up there and

speaker_heading: BENDER (OS)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 12. INT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: We see Brian as we hear Vernon in the hall.
speaker_heading: VERNON (OS)
dialog: God damnit!
text: He opens the door and storms in.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Why is that door closed?
text: For a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare
dialog: at Vernon.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Why is that door closed?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: How're we s'posed to know? We're
dialog: not s'posed to move, right?
text: Vernon turns to Claire.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We were just sitting here, like we
dialog: were s'posed to...
text: Vernon looks around and looks at Bender.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Who closed that door?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I think a screw fell out of it...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It just closed, sir...
text: Vernon looks at Allison in the back.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Who?
text: Allison lets out a squeak and slams her face onto the
text: table, hiding in her jacket hood.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: She doesn't talk, sir...
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: (to Bender)
dialog: Give me that screw...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I don't have it...
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You want me to yank you outta that
dialog: seat and shake it out of you?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I don't have it...screws fall out
dialog: all of the time, the world's an
dialog: imperfect place...
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Give it to me, Bender...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Excuse me, sir, why would anybody
dialog: want to steal a screw?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: (to Claire)
dialog: Watch it, young lady...
text: Vernon goes over to the door. He tries to hold it open
text: by putting a folding chair in front of it.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: The door's way too heavy, sir.
text: The door slams shut despite the chair.
speaker_heading: VERNON (OS)
dialog: God damnit!
text: They laugh.
text: Vernon opens the door again. He comes back in.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Andrew Clark...get up here. Come on,
dialog: front and center, let's go.
text: Andrew gets up and walks over to Vernon.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?
dialog: If he gets up, we'll all get up,
dialog: it'll be anarchy!
text: Vernon and Andrew are now attempting to move the steel
text: magazine rack in front of the door.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Okay, now, watch the magazines!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: It's out of my hands...
text: They get it into the doorway and it blocks the entire
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: That's very clever sir, but what if
dialog: there's a fire? I think violating
dialog: fire codes and endangering the
dialog: lives of children would be unwise
dialog: at this juncture in your career, sir.
text: Vernon thinks about it. He turns to Andrew.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Alright, what are you doing with
dialog: this? Get this outta here for God's
dialog: sake! What's the matter with you?
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You know the school comes equipped
text: with fire exits at either end of the
dialog: library.
text: Brian points at them and Bender glares at him.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: Show Dick some respect!
text: Andrew and Vernon come back into the main section of
dialog: the library.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: (to Andrew)
dialog: Let's go...go! Get back into your
dialog: seat.
text: Andrew sits.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: (to Andrew)
dialog: I expected a little more from a
dialog: varsity letterman!
dialog: (to Bender)
dialog: You're not fooling anybody, Bender!
text: The next screw that falls out is
dialog: gonna be you!
text: Vernon turns to leave.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Eat my shorts...
text: Vernon spins in his tracks and faces Bender again.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Eat my shorts!
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You just bought yourself another
dialog: Saturday, mister!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Oh, Christ...
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You just bought one more right
dialog: there!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Well, I'm free the Saturday after
dialog: that...beyond that, I'm gonna have
dialog: to check my calendar!
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Good! 'Cause it's gonna be filled,
dialog: we'll keep goin'! You want another
dialog: one? Say the word, just say the
dialog: word! Instead of going to prison,
dialog: you'll come here! Are you through.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I'm doing society a favor!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: That's another one, right now! I've
dialog: got you for the rest of your natural
dialog: born life if you don't watch your
dialog: step! You want another one?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You got it! You got another one,
dialog: right there! That's another one
dialog: pal!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Cut it out!
text: Claire mouths the word "Stop" to Bender.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You through?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Not even close, bud!
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Good! You got one more, right
dialog: there!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Do you really think I give a shit?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Another...
text: Bender glares at him.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You through?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: How many is that?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's seven including the one when
dialog: we first came in and you asked Mr.
dialog: Vernon here whether Barry Manilow
dialog: knew that he raided his closet.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: (to Bender)
dialog: Now it's eight...
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: You stay out of it!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Excuse me, sir, it's seven!
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Shut up, Peewee!
dialog: (to Bender)
dialog: You're mine Bender...for two months
dialog: I gotcha! I gotcha!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: What can I say? I'm thrilled!
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Oh, I'm sure that's exactly what you
dialog: want these people to believe. You
dialog: know something, Bender? You ought
dialog: to spend a little more time trying
dialog: to do something with yourself and a
dialog: little less time trying to impress
dialog: people. You might be better off.
dialog: (to everyone)
dialog: Alright, that's it! I'm going to
dialog: be right outside those doors. The
dialog: next time I hafta come in here...I'm
dialog: cracking skulls! (Bender mouths Im
dialog: cracking skulls)
text: Vernon leaves and closes the door. A musical riff
text: builds to a climax as Bender screams.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (screams)
dialog: Fuck you!
text: We see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight.
text: We see Bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a
text: cigarette with his shoe.
text: We see Claire thinking.
text: We see Brian playing with his balls.
text: We see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt.
text: We see Allison pulling a string around her finger and
text: making it turn purple.
text: We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out. He then
text: plays air guitar.
text: We see Allison drawing.
text: We see Andrew playing paper football. He cheers
text: silently.
text: Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture.
text: We see everyone fall asleep.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 13. INT. LIBRARY - DAY
dialog: Later.
text: Vernon is standing there staring at the sleeping kids.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Wake up! Who has to go to the
dialog: lavatory?
text: Everyone raises their hands.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 14. INT. LIBRARY - DAY
dialog: Later.
text: We see the clock, it now says 10:22.
text: We see Andrew stretching. We see Bender tearing pages
text: out of a book. He is tossing them around.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's real intelligent.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You're right...it's wrong to
dialog: destroy literature...
text: He continues to tear pages out.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: It's such fun to read...and, Molet
dialog: really pumps my nads!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (pronouncing it correctly)
dialog: Mol-yare.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I love his work.
text: Bender tosses the rest of the pages at Brian. He picks
text: up the card catalogue drawer and begins to take cards
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Big deal...nothing to do when you're
text: locked in a vacancy..
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Speak for yourself...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Do you think I'd speak for you? I
dialog: don't even know your language!
text: Andrew turns to Claire.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hey, you grounded tonight?
text: Claire shrugs.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know, my mom said I was but
dialog: by dad told me to just blow her off.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Big party at Stubbies, parents are
dialog: in Europe. Should be pretty wild...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah, can you go?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I doubt it...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well 'cause if I do what my mother
dialog: tells me not to do, it's because
dialog: because my father says it's okay.
dialog: There's like this whole big monster
dialog: deal, it's endless and it's a total
dialog: drag. It's like any minute...
dialog: divorce...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Who do you like better?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You like your old man better than
dialog: your mom?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: They're both strict.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: No, I mean, if you had to choose
dialog: between them.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I dunno, I'd probably go live with
dialog: my brother. I mean, I don't think
dialog: either one of them gives a shit
dialog: about me...it's like they use me
dialog: just to get back at each other.
text: Suddenly, from the back of the room. Allison speaks.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Ha!!!
text: Everyone looks at her shocked. Allison blows her hair
text: out of her eyes and grins.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You're just feeling sorry for
dialog: yourself...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Yeah, well if I didn't nobody else
dialog: would.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Aw...you're breaking my heart...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Sporto...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What?
text: Bender jumps down and goes next to Andrew.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You get along with your parents?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well if I say yes, I'm an idiot,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You're an idiot anyway...But if you
dialog: say you get along with your parents
dialog: well you're a liar too!
text: Bender turns and walks away from him. Andrew follows
text: and pushes Bender.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You know something, man...If we
dialog: weren't in school right now, I'd
dialog: waste you!
text: Bender points his middle finger at the floor.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Can you hear this? Want me to turn
dialog: it up?
text: Bender flips his hand around so he is now giving Andrew
dialog: the bird.
text: Brian comes over and puts a hand on each of the guy's
dialog: shoulders.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Hey fellas, I mean...
text: Andrew pushes away from Brian.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: ...I don't like my parents either,
dialog: I don't...I don't get along with
dialog: them...their idea of parental
dialog: compassion is just, you know, wacko!
text: Bender turns to Brian.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Dork...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You are a parent's wet dream, okay?
text: Bender starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well that's a problem!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Look, I can see you getting all
dialog: bunged up for them making you wear
dialog: these kinda clothes. But face it,
dialog: you're a Neo-Maxi-Zoom-Dweebie!
dialog: What would you be doing if you
dialog: weren't out making yourself a better
dialog: citizen?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Why do you have to insult everybody?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I'm being honest, asshole! I would
dialog: expect you...to know the difference!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah well, he's gotta name!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah,
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Brian...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: See...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: My condolences...
text: Bender walks away.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to Bender)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: What's yours?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Claire...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Ka-Laire?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Claire...it's a family name!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Nooo...It's a fat girl's name!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well thank you...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You're welcome...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm not fat!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Well not at present but I could see
dialog: you really pushing maximum density!
dialog: You see, I'm not sure if you know
dialog: this...but there are two kinds of
dialog: fat people. There's fat people that
dialog: were born to be fat, and then there's
dialog: fat people that were once thin but
dialog: they became fat...so when you look
dialog: at them you can sorta see that thin
dialog: person inside! You see, you're
dialog: gonna get married, you're gonna
dialog: squeeze out a few puppies and then,
dialog: uh...
text: He mimes becoming fat, making noises.
text: Claire gives him the finger.
speaker_heading: BENDER
text: Oh...obscene finger gestures from
dialog: such a pristine girl!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (resentfully)
dialog: I'm not that pristine!
text: Bender bends down closer to Claire.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Are you a virgin?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I'll bet you a million dollars that
dialog: you are! Let's end the suspense!
dialog: Is it gonna be...
dialog: (another beat)
dialog: ...a white weddin?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Why don't you just shut up?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Have you ever kissed a boy on the
dialog: mouth?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Have you ever been felt up? Over
text: the bra, under the blouse, shoes
dialog: off...hoping to God your parents
dialog: don't walk in?
text: Claire is getting upset.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Do you want me to puke?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Over the panties, no bra, blouse
text: unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on
text: the front seat past eleven on a
dialog: school night?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Leave her alone!
text: Bender slowly stands and faces Andrew.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I said leave her alone!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You gonna make me?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yeah...
text: Bender walks over to where Andrew is standing.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You and how many of your friends?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Just me, just you and me. Two hits.
dialog: Me hitting you, you hitting the
dialog: floor! Anytime you're ready, pal!
text: Bender goes to hit him but Andrew gets Bender down on
text: the ground with a wrestling move.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I don't wanna get into to this with
dialog: you man...
text: Andrew gets up.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Why not?
text: Bender gets up.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: 'Cause I'd kill you...It's real simple.
dialog: I'd kill you and your fucking parents
dialog: would sue me and it would be a big
dialog: mess and I don't care enough about
dialog: you to bother.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Chicken shit...
text: Andrew turns and walks away. Bender takes out a
text: switchblade and opens it.
text: He stabs the switchblade into a chair.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Let's end this right now. You don't
dialog: talk to her...you don't look at her
dialog: and you don't even think about her!
dialog: You understand me?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I'm trying to help her!.
text: We see the janitor, CARL come into the room.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Brian, how you doing?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Your dad works here?
text: Brian is embarrassed.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Uh, Carl?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Sure...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: How does one become a janitor?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You wanna be a janitor?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: No I just wanna know how one becomes
dialog: a janitor because Andrew here, is
dialog: very interested in persuing a
dialog: career in the custodial arts...
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Oh, really? You guys think I'm
dialog: just some untouchable peasant? Peon?
dialog: Huh? Maybe so, but following
text: a broom around after shitheads like
dialog: you for the past eight years I've
dialog: learned a couple of things...I look
dialog: through your letters, I look through
dialog: your lockers...I listen to your
dialog: conversations, you don't know that
dialog: but I do...I am the eyes and ears of
dialog: this institution my friends. By the
dialog: way, that clock's twenty minutes
dialog: fast!
text: Everyone groans. Bender smiles.
speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Allright girls, that's thirty
dialog: minutes for lunch...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Here?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Here...
speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: lunch in, sir!
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Well, I don't care what you think,
dialog: Andrew!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Uh, Dick? Excuse me, Rich...will
dialog: milk be made available to us?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We're extremely thirsty sir...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I have a very low tolerance for
dialog: dehydration.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I've seen her dehydrate sir, it's
dialog: pretty gross.
text: Bender stands.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Relax, I'll get it!
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Ah, ah, ah grab some wood there, bub!
text: Bender grins.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What do you think, I was born
dialog: yesterday? You think I'm gonna
dialog: have you roaming these halls?
text: He points at Andrew.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You!

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 16. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: So, what's your poison?
text: Allison doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What do you drink?
text: Allison still doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Okay...forget I asked...
text: Allison waits for two beats and then speaks.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Vodka...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Vodka? When do you drink vodka?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Whenever...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: A lot?
text: Allison smiles.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Tons...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Is that why you're here today?
text: Allison doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Why are you here?
text: Allison snaps back.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Why are you here?
text: They stop walking and Andrew leans against the wall.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Um, I'm here today...because uh,
dialog: because my coach and my father don't
dialog: want me to blow my ride. See I get
dialog: treated differently because uh,
dialog: Coach thinks I'm a winner. So does
dialog: my old man. I'm not a winner
dialog: because I wanna be one... I'm a
dialog: winner because I got strength and
dialog: speed. Kinda like a race horse.
dialog: That's about how involved I am in
dialog: what's happening to me.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Yeah? That's very interesting.
dialog: Now why don't you tell me why you're
dialog: really in here.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Forget it!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 17. INT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: Claire and Bender and Brian are all sitting around

speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Claire...you wanna see a picture of
dialog: a guy with elephantitus of the nuts?
dialog: It's pretty tasty...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No thank you...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: How do you think he rides a bike?
text: Claire rolls her eyes and turns away in disgust.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Oh, Claire...would you ever consider
dialog: dating a guy like this?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Can't you just leave me alone?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I mean if he had a great personality
dialog: and was a good dancer and had a cool
dialog: car...Although you'd probably have
dialog: to ride in the back seat 'cause his
dialog: nuts would ride shotgun.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You know what I wish I was doing?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Op, watch what you say, Brian here
dialog: is a cherry.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: A cherry?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I wish I was on a plane to France.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm not a cherry.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: When have you ever gotten laid?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I've laid, lotsa times!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Name one!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: She lives in Canada, met her at

speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Ever laid anyone around here.
text: Brian shushes Bender and points at Claire whos back is

speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (to Claire)
dialog: Nothin', nothin!
dialog: (to Bender)
dialog: Let's just drop it, we'll talk about
dialog: it later!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No! Drop what, what're you talking
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Well, Brian's trying to tell me that
dialog: in addition to the number of girls
dialog: in the Niagra Falls area, that
dialog: presently you and he are, riding
dialog: the hobby horse!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: Little pig!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No I'm not! I'm not! John said I
dialog: was a cherry and I said I wasn't,
dialog: that's it, that's all that was said!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Well then what were you motioning to
dialog: Claire for?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You know I don't appreciate this
dialog: very much, Brian.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: He is lying!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Oh you weren't motioning to Claire?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You know he's lying, right?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Were you or were you not motioning
dialog: to Claire?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, but it was only...was only
dialog: because I didn't want her to know
dialog: that I was a virgin, okay?
text: Bender just stares at him.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Excuse me for being a virgin, I'm
dialog: sorry...
text: Claire laughs.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Why didn't you want me to know you
dialog: were a virgin?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Because it's personal business, it's
dialog: my personal, private business.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Well Brian, it doesn't sound like
dialog: you're doing any business...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I think it's okay for a guy to be a
dialog: virgin...
text: Bender looks suprised.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You do?
text: Claire smiles and nods.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 18. INT. LIBRARY - DAY
dialog: Later.
text: Everybody has lunches now.
text: Claire begins to take hers out of a small shopping bag.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: What's in there?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Guess, where's your lunch?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You're wearing it...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're nauseating...
text: Bender grabs a Coke and tosses it over to Allison who
text: catches it without even looking up.
text: Bender then watches Claire set up a sushi platter.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Sushi...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Sushi?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Rice, uh, raw fish and seaweed.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You won't accept a guys tongue in
dialog: your mouth and you're gonna eat
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Can I eat?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I don't know...give it a try...
text: We now watch Andrew take a couple sandwiches out of his
text: bag, a bag of potato chips, an apple, a banana, a bag
text: of cookies and a carton of milk.
text: Allison opens her Coke and it fizzes over. She loudly
text: slurps it up off the table and her fingers.
text: Andrew sees Bender looking at him.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What's your problem?
text: Allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up.
text: It lands on the sculpture above.
text: She opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the
text: sandwich and then puts Cap'n Crunch on top of that.
text: She crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it.
text: Bender goes over and sits by Brian, Bender takes
text: Brian's bag lunch.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: What're we having?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Uh, it's your standard, regular
dialog: lunch I guess...
text: Bender reaches in the bag and pulls out a thermos. He
text: sets it on the table and points at it.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Milk?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Soup.
text: Bender goes in again and pulls out a juice box.
text: Brian reaches toward the bag and Bender slaps his hand.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That's apple juice...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I can read! PB &amp; J with the crusts
dialog: cut off...Well Brian, this is a
dialog: very nutritous lunch, all the food
dialog: groups are represented. Did your
dialog: mom marry Mr. Rogers?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Uh, no, Mr. Johnson...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Ahhh....
text: Andrew and Claire smile at each other. Bender stands.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Here's my impression of life at big
dialog: Bri's house...
dialog: (in a loud and friendly voice)
dialog: Son!
dialog: (in a kiddie voice)
dialog: Yeah Dad?
dialog: (loud)
dialog: How's your day, pal?
dialog: (kiddie)
dialog: Great Dad, how's yours?

dialog: on the boat!
dialog: (kiddie)
dialog: Geee!!!
dialog: (loud)
dialog: Dear, isn't our son swell?
dialog: (quiet and motherly)
dialog: Yes Dear, isn't life swell?
text: Bender mimes mother kissing father and then father
text: kissing mother and then father punching mother in the
dialog: face.
text: Suddenly it's not so funny anymore.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Alright, what about your family?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Oh, mine?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's real easy!
text: Bender stands again and points forward.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (as his father)
dialog: Stupid, worthless, no good, God
dialog: damned, freeloading, son of a bitch,
dialog: retarded, bigmouth, know it all,
dialog: asshole, jerk!
dialog: (as his mother)
dialog: You forgot ugly, lazy and
dialog: disrespectful.
text: Bender slams his hand back to slap his invisable
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (as his father)
dialog: Shut up bitch! Go fix me a turkey
dialog: pot pie!
dialog: (as himself)
dialog: What about you Dad?
dialog: (as his father)
dialog: Fuck you!
dialog: (as himself)
dialog: No, Dad, what about you?
dialog: (as his father)
dialog: Fuck you!
dialog: (as himself--yelling)
dialog: No, Dad, what about you?
dialog: (as his father--yelling)
dialog: Fuck you!
text: He reaches out and pretend he's his father hitting him.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Is that for real?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: You wanna come over sometime?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's bullshit. It's all part of
dialog: your image, I don't believe a word
dialog: of it.
text: Bender actually looks hurt.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You don't believe me?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Did I stutter?
text: Bender comes over to Andrew and rolls up his right
text: sleeve to reveal a circular shaped burn.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Do you believe this? Huh? It's
dialog: about the size of a cigar...Do I

dialog: And what'd he do when you told him?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: He nailed me...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Very nice...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I don't think that from a legal
dialog: standpoint what he did can be
dialog: construed as rape since I paid him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He's an adult!
text: Allison is relishing this attention.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Yeah...he's married too!
text: Claire notes her disgust.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Do you have any idea how completely
dialog: gross that is?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Well, the first few times...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: First few times? You mean he did it
dialog: more than once?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Sure...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Are you crazy?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Obviously she's crazy if she's
dialog: screwing her shrink...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: (to Claire)
dialog: Have you ever done it?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't even have a psychiatrist...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Have you ever done it with a normal
dialog: person?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Now, didn't we already cover this?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You never answered the question...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Look, I'm not gonna discuss my
dialog: private life with total strangers.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: It's kind of a double-edged sword,
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Well, if you say you haven't...
dialog: you're a prude. If you say you
dialog: have...you're a slut! It's a trap.
dialog: You want to but you can't but when
dialog: you do you wish you didn't, right?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Wrong...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Or, are you a tease?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: She's a tease...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh why don't you just forget it...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You're a tease and you know it, all
dialog: girls are teases!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (to Andrew)
dialog: She's only a tease if what she does
dialog: gets you hot...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't do anything!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: That's why you're a tease...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.
text: Allison is suddenly defensive.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I've already told you everything!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No! Doesn't it bother you to sleep
dialog: around without being in love. I
dialog: mean don't you want any respect?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I don't screw to get respect...That's
dialog: the difference between you and me...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Not the only difference, I hope.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Face it, you're a tease.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm not a tease!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Sure you are! You said it yourself
dialog: sex is a weapon, you use it to get
dialog: respect!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, I never said that, she twisted
dialog: my words around.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Oh then what do you use it for?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't use it period!
text: Claire is on the verge of tears.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Oh, are you medically frigid or is
dialog: it psychological?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I didn't mean it that way! You guys
dialog: are putting words into my mouth!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Well if you'd just answer the
dialog: question...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Why don't you just answer the
dialog: question?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Be honest...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: No big deal...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, answer it!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Answer the question, Claire!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Talk to us!
scene_heading: ANDREW &amp; BRIAN
dialog: Come on, answer the question!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: It's easy, it's only one question!
text: Claire silences all of them by screaming.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: No! I never did it!
text: Silence for two beats.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I never did it either, I'm not a
dialog: nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive
dialog: liar...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You are such a bitch! You did that
dialog: on purpose just to fuck me over!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I would do it though...If you love
dialog: someone it's okay...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I can't believe you, you're so
dialog: weird. You don't say anything all
dialog: day and then when you open your
dialog: mouth...you unload all these
dialog: tremendous lies all over me!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You're just pissed off because she
dialog: got you to admit something you didn't
dialog: want to admit to...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it
dialog: any less bizarre...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What's bizarre? I mean we're all
dialog: pretty bizarre! Some of us are just
dialog: better at hiding it, that's all.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to Andrew)
dialog: How are you bizarre?
text: Allison decides to field that question.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: He can't think for himself...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: She's right...do you guys know what,
dialog: uh, what I did to get in here? I
text: taped Larry Lester's buns together.
text: Claire laughs.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (to Andrew)
dialog: That was you?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (to Brian)
dialog: Yeah, you know him?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, I know him...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well then you know how hairy he is,
dialog: right? Well, when they pulled the
text: tape off, most of his hair came off
dialog: and some, some skin too...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: And the bizarre thing is, is that
dialog: I did it for my old man...I
dialog: tortured this poor kid, because I
dialog: wanted him to think that I was cool.
dialog: He's always going off about, you
dialog: know, when he was in school...all
dialog: the wild things he used to do. And
dialog: I got the feeling that he was
dialog: disappointed that I never cut loose
dialog: on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm
dialog: sitting in the locker room, and I'm
dialog: taping up my knee. And Larry's
text: undressing a couple lockers down
dialog: from me. Yeah...he's kinda...
dialog: he's kinda skinny, weak. And I
dialog: started thinking about my father,
dialog: and his attitude about weakness.
dialog: And the next thing I knew, I uh, I
text: jumped on top of him and started
dialog: wailing on him...And my friends,
dialog: they just laughed and cheered me on.
dialog: And afterwards, when I was sittin'
dialog: in Vernon's office, all I could
dialog: think about was Larry's father. And
dialog: Larry havin' to go home and...and
dialog: explain what happened to him. And
dialog: the humiliation...fucking
dialog: humiliation he mustuv felt. It
dialog: mustuv been unreal...I mean,
dialog: (he's crying)
dialog: I mean, how do you apologize for
dialog: something like that? There's no
dialog: way...it's all because of me and
dialog: my old man. Oh God, I fucking hate
dialog: him! He's like this...he's like
dialog: this mindless machine that I can't
dialog: even relate to anymore..."Andrew,
dialog: you've got to be number one! I
dialog: won't tolerate any losers in this
dialog: family...Your intensity is for shit!
dialog: Win. Win! WIN!!!" You son of a
dialog: bitch! You know, sometimes, I wish
dialog: my knee would give...and I wouldn't
dialog: be able to wrestle anymore. And he
dialog: could forget all about me...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I think your old man and my old man
dialog: should get together and go bowling.
text: Andrew laughs briefly.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It's like me, you know, with my
dialog: grades...like, when I, when I
dialog: step outside myself kinda, and
dialog: when I, when I look in at myself
dialog: you know? And I see me and I don't
dialog: like what I see, I really don't.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What's wrong with you? Why don't
dialog: you like yourself?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: 'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing
dialog: shop. See we had this assignment,
dialog: to make this ceramic elephant, and
dialog: um...and we had eight weeks to do
dialog: it and we're s'posed ta, and it was
dialog: like a lamp, and when you pull the
dialog: trunk the light was s'posed to go
dialog: on...my light didn't go on, I got a
dialog: F on it. Never got a F in my life...
dialog: When I signed up, you know, for the
dialog: course I mean. I thought I was
dialog: playing it real smart, you know.
dialog: 'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,
dialog: it'll be such an easy way to
dialog: maintain my grade point average...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Why'd you think it'd be easy?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Have you seen some of the dopes that
dialog: take shop?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I take shop...you must be a fuckin'
dialog: idiot!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't
dialog: make a lamp?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: No, you're a genius because you
dialog: can't make a lamp...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What do you know about Trigonometry?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I could care less about
dialog: Trigonometry...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Bender, did you know without
dialog: Trigonometry there'd be no
dialog: engineering?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Without lamps, there'd be no light!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay so neither one of you is any
dialog: better than the other one...
text: Allison feels left out.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I can write with my toes! I can
dialog: also eat, brush my teeth...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: With your feet?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: ...play Heart &amp; Soul on the piano.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I can make spaghetti!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (to Andrew)
dialog: What can you do?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I can...uh...tape all your buns
dialog: together...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I wanna see what Claire can do!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I can't do anything.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Now, everybody can do something...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: There's one thing I can do, no
dialog: forget it, it's way too embarrassing.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You ever seen Wild Kingdom? I mean
dialog: that guy's been doing that show for
dialog: thirty years.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay, but you have to swear to God
dialog: you won't laugh...I can't believe
dialog: I'm actually doing this...
text: Claire takes lipstick out and opens it. She places it
text: between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.
text: When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.
text: Everyone claps. Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: All right, great! Where'd you learn
dialog: to do that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Camp, seventh grade...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: That was great, Claire...my image of
dialog: you is totally blown...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: You're a shit! Don't do that to her
dialog: you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Am I laughing?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You fucking prick!
text: Bender turns to Andrew. As he speaks, we can see his
text: words hitting home.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: What do you care what I think,
dialog: anyway? I don't even count, right?
dialog: I could disappear forever and it
dialog: wouldn't make any difference...I may
dialog: as well not even exist at this
dialog: school, remember?
dialog: (he turns to Claire)
dialog: And you...don't like me anyway!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You know, I have just as many
dialog: feelings as you do and it hurts
dialog: just as much when somebody steps
dialog: all over them!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: God, you're so pathetic!
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Don't you ever...ever! Compare
dialog: yourself to me! Okay? You got
dialog: everything, and I got shit! Fuckin'
dialog: Rapunzel, right? School would
dialog: probably fucking shut down if you
dialog: didn't show up! "Queenie isn't
dialog: here!" I like those earrings Claire.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Shut up...
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Are those real diamonds, Claire?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: BENDER CLAIRE
dialog: I bet they are...did you
dialog: work, for the money Shut...
dialog: for those earrings? Your mouth!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Or did your daddy buy those?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Shut up!
text: Claire starts crying.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: I bet he bought those for you! I
dialog: bet those are a Christmas gift!
dialog: Right? You know what I got for
dialog: Christmas this year? It was a
dialog: banner fuckin' year at the old
dialog: Bender family! I got a carton of
dialog: cigarettes. The old man grabbed me
dialog: and said "Hey! Smoke up Johnny!"
dialog: Okay, so go home'n cry to your
dialog: daddy, don't cry here, okay?
text: There are a few beats.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: My God, are we gonna be like our
dialog: parents?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Not me...ever...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: It's unavoidable, it just happens.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What happens?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: When you grow up, your heart dies.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Who cares?
text: Allison is on the verge of tears herself.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I care...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Um, I was just thinking, I mean. I
dialog: know it's kind of a weird time, but
dialog: I was just wondering, um, what is
dialog: gonna happen to us on Monday? When
dialog: we're all together again? I mean I
dialog: consider you guys my friends, I'm
dialog: not wrong, am I?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: So, so on Monday...what happens?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Are we still friends, you mean?
dialog: If we're friends now, that is?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Do you want the truth?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, I want the truth...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't think so...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Well, do you mean all of us or just
dialog: John?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: With all of you...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's a real nice attitude, Claire!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came
dialog: walking up to you in the hall on
dialog: Monday, what would you do? I mean
dialog: picture this, you're there with all
dialog: the sports. I know exactly what
dialog: you'd do, you'd say hi to him and
dialog: when he left you'd cut him all up
dialog: so your friends wouldn't think you
dialog: really liked him!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No way!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: 'Kay, what if I came up to you?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Same exact thing!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (furious and screaming at Claire)
dialog: You are a bitch!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Why? 'Cause I'm telling the truth,
dialog: that makes me a bitch?
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: No! 'Cause you know how shitty that
dialog: is to do to someone! And you don't
dialog: got the balls to stand up to your
dialog: friends and tell 'em that you're
dialog: gonna like who you wanna like!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!
dialog: Why don't you take Allison to one of
dialog: your heavy metal vomit parties? Or
text: take Brian out to the parking lot at
dialog: lunch to get high? What about Andy
dialog: for that matter, what about me?
dialog: What would your friends say if we
text: were walking down the hall together.
dialog: They'd laugh their asses off and
dialog: you'd probably tell them you were
dialog: doing it with me so they'd forgive
dialog: you for being seen with me.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: (furious once again)
dialog: Don't you ever talk about my
dialog: friends! You don't know any of my
dialog: friends, you don't look at any of my
dialog: friends and you certainly wouldn't
dialog: condescend to speak to any of my
dialog: friends so you just stick to the
dialog: things you know, shopping, nail
dialog: polish, your father's BMW and your
dialog: poor--rich--drunk mother in the
dialog: Carribean!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (furious and sobbing)
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: And as far as being concerned about
dialog: what's gonna happen when you and I
text: walk down the hallways at school,
dialog: you can forget it! 'Cause it's never
dialog: gonna happen! Just bury your head
dialog: in the sand...and wait for your
dialog: fuckin' prom!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I hate you!
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Yeah? Good!
text: There is silence until Brian speaks.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Then I assume Allison and I are
dialog: better people than you guys, huh?
dialog: Us weirdos...
dialog: (to Allison)
dialog: Do you, would you do that to me?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I don't have any friends...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well if you did?
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: No...I don't think the kind of
dialog: friends I'd have would mind...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I just wanna tell, each of you,
dialog: that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't
dialog: and I will not! 'Cause I think that's
dialog: real shitty...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Your friends wouldn't mind because
dialog: they look up to us...
text: Brian laughs at her.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're so conceited, Claire. You're
dialog: so conceited. You're so, like, full
dialog: of yourself, why are you like that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (crying again)
dialog: I'm not saying that to be conceited!
dialog: I hate it! I hate having to go
dialog: along with everything my friends say!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well then why do you do it?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I don't know, I don't...you don't
dialog: understand..you don't. You're not
dialog: friends with the same kind of people
dialog: that Andy and I are friends with!
dialog: You know, you just don't understand
dialog: the pressure that they can put on
dialog: you!
text: Brian is shocked.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I don't understand what? You think
dialog: I don't understand pressure, Claire?
dialog: Well fuck you! Fuck you!
text: Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Know why I'm here today? Do you?
dialog: I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a
text: gun in the locker...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Why'd you have a gun in your locker?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I tried. You pull the fuckin' trunk
dialog: on it and the light's s'posed to go
dialog: on...and it didn't go on, I mean,
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What's the gun for Brian?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Just forget it...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You brought it up, man!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I can't have an F, I can't have it
dialog: and I know my parents can't have it!
dialog: Even if I aced the rest of the
dialog: semester, I'm still only a B. And
dialog: everything's ruined for me!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (with pity)
dialog: Oh Brian...
text: Brian bashes a chair over.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: So I considered my options, you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No! Killing yourself is not an
dialog: option!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well I didn't do it, did I? No, I
dialog: don't think so!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: It was a hand gun?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No, it was a flare gun, went off
dialog: in my locker.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Really?
text: Andrew starts to laugh.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It's not funny...
text: They all start to laugh, including Brian.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was
dialog: destroyed!
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: You wanna know what I did to get in
dialog: here? Nothing...I didn't have
dialog: anything better to do.
text: Everyone laughs.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: You're laughing at me...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No!
text: Allison starts to laugh too.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Yeah you are!

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Yeah, why?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well, it's kinda a waste for all of
dialog: us to write our paper, don't you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us
dialog: to do...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: True, but I think we'd all kinda
dialog: say the same thing.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You just don't want to write your
dialog: paper...Right?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: True, but, you're the smartest,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: This looks a lot better...look up.

text: Claire kisses Bender, then she breaks the kiss.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: Why'd you do that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: 'Cause I knew you wouldn't.
speaker_heading: BENDER
dialog: You know how you said before, how
dialog: your parents used you to get back
dialog: at each other...wouldn't I be
dialog: outstanding in that capacity?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Were you really disgusted about
dialog: what I did with my lipstick?
