text: A few (six) years later. He is dressed well now. slight show
text: of some wealth. overcoat, haircut, clean shaven, etc. We see
text: nothing but him as he speaks;
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen, I’ve traveled
dialog: over half our state to get here this
dialog: evening. I couldn't get away sooner because
dialog: my new well was coming in at Coyote Hills and
dialog: I had to see about it. That well is now
dialog: flowing at two thousand barrels and it’s
dialog: paying me an income of five thousand dollars
dialog: a week. I have two others drilling and I have
text: sixteen producing at Antelope.
dialog: So — Ladies and Gentlemen — if I say I’m an
dialog: oil man, you will agree.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You have a great chance here — but bear in
dialog: mind: you can loose it all if you’re not
dialog: careful. Out of all men that beg for a chance
dialog: to drill your lots, maybe one in twenty will be
dialog: oil men; the rest will be speculators — men
dialog: trying to get between you and the oil men — to
dialog: get some of the money that ought by rights come
dialog: to you. Even if you find one that has money,
dialog: and means to drill, he’1ll maybe know nothing
dialog: about drilling and he’1ll have to hire out the
dialog: job on contract — and then you’re depending on
dialog: a contractor that’s tryin’ to rush the job
dialog: through — so he can get another contract just
dialog: as quick as he can. This is way that this
dialog: works.
text: An OC VOICE INTERRUPTS, LOUDLY; Daniel holds his composure.
speaker_heading: OC MALE VOICE
text: WHAT IS YOUR OFFER? WE'RE WASTING TIME.
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I do my own drilling and the men that work
dialog: for me, work for me and they are men I know.
dialog: I make it my business to be there and see to
dialog: their work. I don’t lose my tools in the hole
dialog: and spend months fishing for them; I don’t
text: botch the cementing off and let water in the
dialog: hole and ruin the whole lease.
text: REVEAL, AT THAT MOMENT, young H.W. (age 7) He is standing behind
text: Daniel and looking at the group OC. Daniel and H.W.;
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I'm fixed like no other
dialog: company in this field and that’s
dialog: because my Coyote Hills well has just
dialog: come in — I have a string of tools
dialog: all ready to put to work..I can load a rig
dialog: onto trucks and have them here in a week.
dialog: I have business connections so I can get
dialog: the lumber for the derrick — such things go
dialog: by friendship in a rush like this.
dialog: And this is why I can guarantee to start
dialog: drilling and put up the cash to back my word.
dialog: I assure you, whatever the others promise
dialog: to do, when it comes to the showdown, they
dialog: won't be there...
scene_heading: REVERSE, THE ROOM, THAT MOMENT

speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: ANOTHER MAN
dialog: LET HIM FINISH. Please, Mr. Plainview --
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: It’s not up to me to say how you’re going
dialog: to divide the royalty. But let me say this;
dialog: whatever you give up so you can get together —
dialog: it will be smart compared to what you may loose
text: by delay. The crooks and the gamblers are near
text: and the wolf is scratching the door.
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen, take it from
dialog: me as an oil man — humbly — there aren’t going
text: to be many gushers here at Signal Hill.
text: A field plays out very quick. In two or three
dialog: years, these wells will be dry — even this
text: discovery well that’s gushing down the road and
dialog: has everyone so crazy. So my suggestion, with
dialog: respect, is take a smaller share of royalty
dialog: and we will see that it’s a small
dialog: share of a bigger royalty. That,
dialog: ladies and gentleman, is what I had to say.
text: HOLD ON THE ROOM. Everyone has taken this in, then: THE ROOM
text: ERUPTS AS EACH FAMILY SCREAMS AND YELLS AND UNLEASHES THEIR
text: WRATH AT EACH OTHER ABOUT HOW THEIR LOTS SHOULD BE DIVIDED AND
text: ROYALTIES SHARED AND MEASURMENTS OF “SMALL LOTS” “BIG LOTS”
scene_heading: “LITTLE BIG LOTS” “LITTLE SMALL LOTS” WOMEN SCREAM: “WE SHOULD
text: JUST GO WITH A FAMILY OPERATION, IT’S MORE IMPORTANT!” A MAN
scene_heading: SCREAMS: “BULL.”
text: We witness human dignity go completely out the window.
text: Daniel stands, slowly turns and walks out the door, without even

speaker_heading: PRESCOTT
dialog: no, please, Mr. Plainview where are you going?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I don’t need the lease, thank you.
speaker_heading: PRESCOTT
dialog: But, no, no, we need you, we'd like
dialog: for you to begin —
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: There’s too much confusion. Thank
dialog: you for your time.
speaker_heading: PRESCOTT
dialog: No confusion, let us just, please come
dialog: back and we can all settle this —
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: I wouldn’t take the lease if you gave
dialog: it to me as a gift.

speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: Mr. Bankside, I’m not going to waste
dialog: your time and I’d like it if you didn’t
dialog: waste mine. If you want to sign with
dialog: me we can have a well drilling within
dialog: ten days. Your lot is further North from
dialog: the discovery well up here so it means we
dialog: will probably have to dig deeper. If there's
dialog: as much oil up here as I think there is, it
dialog: will be harder to reach but once we find it
dialog: we can take it right out. But we have to
dialog: act quickly because very soon these grounds
dialog: will dry up. I need you to know what you
dialog: want to do. Because of the distance
dialog: from the discovery well I’1l pay you a smaller
dialog: royalty than you’d get down there — but I'll
dialog: give you a thousand dollar bonus on your lot.
speaker_heading: BANKSIDE
dialog: what royalty?
speaker_heading: DANIEL
dialog: A sixth — now that’s standard.
dialog: And a guarantee to start
