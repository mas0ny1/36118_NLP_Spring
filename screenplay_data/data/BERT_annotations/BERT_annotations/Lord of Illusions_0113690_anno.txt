speaker_heading: TITLE SEQUENCE
text: As the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences:
scene_heading: EXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY
text: A SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed,
text: surreal, six-foot tall "IDOLS." Like modern demons.
text: Grotesque. Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of
text: their twisted anatomies: headlamp eyes, bright metal claws,
text: broken glass teeth.
scene_heading: EXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY
text: Two vehicles, one a Volkswagen "bus" decorated with stylized
text: flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series
text: of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of
text: sand and heat.
scene_heading: END CREDITS.
speaker_heading: CUT WIDE TO;
scene_heading: EXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY
text: A violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just
text: make out a large, ominous building: the HOUSE of William
text: Nix. Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI.
text: The "family" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON
text: SCREEN, the words: '"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago"
scene_heading: EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY
text: We're at the front door now, which stands open. Leaning
text: against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
text: sixteen. His name is BUTTERFIELD. He's got a brooding,
text: almost sultry look on his face. One of his eyes is black,
text: the other milky blue. He's whittling something with a
text: scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES. Butterfield
text: narrows his eyes.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.
text: The Volkswagen "bus" and Thunderbird are approaching the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Swann...?
text: He turns from the door. In his haste he drops the WOOD he's
text: whittling. He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY
text: The house no longer serves any domestic function. It has
text: become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic
text: cult. As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
dialog: a little of what life here is like.
text: The rooms are murky, and chaotic. The walls, PAINTED with
text: scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from
text: some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING
text: helpless humanity. The atmosphere is joyless, and
text: oppressive.
text: The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
text: way to the heart of the house. Only OIL LAMPS, set on the
text: floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Master?
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY
text: A dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
text: their leader, WILLIAM NIX. His black hair grows to his
text: shoulders. His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
text: seductive. A terrifying yet charismatic presence.
text: All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
text: wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL.
text: They watch Nix in adoration.
text: As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to
text: hand with casual ease...
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: And the fire said to me: Nix, Nix,
dialog: you're my instrument. From now on,
dialog: you'll be called the Puritan...
speaker_heading: CULTISTS
dialog: (murmuring)
dialog: Puritan...
dialog: NIX You will find a few good men and women, and together,
dialog: together you will cleanse the world.
speaker_heading: CULTISTS
dialog: Yes...
text: Butterfield enters.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Master?
text: Nix looks up.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Swann's here.
text: Nix rises, smiling.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (to Cultists)
dialog: We'll come back to this. Get about
dialog: your business.
text: As the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
text: A place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling
text: is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a
text: large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and
text: knotted rope. It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
text: creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian. It is a
text: perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.
text: From the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft
speaker_heading: SOBBING.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Hush...
text: Nix goes to the GIRL. She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and
text: presently in a state of mortal fear. She sits, bound, in a
text: fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her
text: mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: I said hush.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Please. Let me go.
text: From the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON.
text: Nix goes to it. The animal is large and lethal.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (to Baboon)
dialog: What is it?
text: The Baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the Girl and baring
text: its teeth as it screeches.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (to Girl)
dialog: I think he's in love.
text: He unshackles the Baboon. The animal pads toward the Girl,
text: trailing its chain.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Keep it away from me.
text: Nix catches hold of its chain. Holds it back. The Baboon
text: starts screeching again, scrabbling at the Girl, its NAILS
text: catching her arms and legs, drawing BLOOD.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Please... please...
text: Nix watches her terror dispassionately.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: (also watching, wide-
dialog: eyed)
dialog: Want me to shoot Swann?
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: You don't like him, do you?
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: He wants your magic.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Maybe. Go fetch him.
text: Butterfield exits. Nix advances on the Girl.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAY
text: The two vehicles come to a halt outside Nix's house.
text: From the Thunderbird steps PHILIP SWANN, a nineteen- year-old
text: with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes. He's not
text: conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking.
text: From the passenger seat steps CASPAR QUAID, a black man,
text: studious and intense. From the bus emerges MURRAY PIMM,
text: skinny and jittery, and JENNIFER DESIDERIO, a woman with a
text: steely gaze.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: (to all three)
dialog: Are we ready?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (cool)
dialog: Say the word.
speaker_heading: PIMM
dialog: (very nervous)
dialog: Look, maybe we should think this over.
text: On Swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
text: of METALWORK. We get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
text: he slips them into his pocket.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: No. He's gone too far.
speaker_heading: PIMM
dialog: So he took a child.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: He'll kill her.
speaker_heading: PIMM
dialog: No he won't.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: (determined)
dialog: He's not going to get the chance.
text: Quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: So stay out here.
text: Swann starts towards the House. Jennifer is the first to
text: follow, with the other two on her heels.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Butterfield comes to the door, as Swann steps inside.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: He's expecting you.
text: Behind Swann, Quaid and Pimm exchange nervous looks.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: (to others)
dialog: Look around. If you find 'the
dialog: child, yell. She's got blonde
dialog: hair, that's all I know.
text: Butterfield turns away, smiling to himself. Swann follows
dialog: him.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "MEDITATION" ROOM - DAY
text: Quaid looks into a large circular room where FIVE CULTISTS
text: (three men and two women) still sit. One of the women is
text: breast-feeding a baby.
speaker_heading: 1ST MAN
dialog: Hey, Quaid. I thought you said you
dialog: weren't coming back.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: I changed my mind.
speaker_heading: 1ST WOMAN
dialog: Come and join us.
text: She smiles a crazy smile. Reaches out for Quaid. A SNAKE
text: appears from around the back of her neck. Quaid recoils.
dialog: And now we see that there are snakes everywhere. In the
text: Cultists' clothes and hair. Even on the baby. Quaid turns
text: away. And - shock! - there's a SNAKE on the door frame,
text: winding around his hand. He strikes it to the ground, and
text: drives his heel down on its head.
scene_heading: SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Don't do that!
text: The Snake-Handler gets up. Quaid retreats from the door.
text: Snake-Handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above
text: his head, dribbles its BLOOD onto his face.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - "BEDROOM" - DAY
text: Jennifer enters a gloomy room. She goes to a mattress where
text: a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Don't be afraid.
text: The Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over. She has a dirty cloth
text: pressed to a wound between her breasts. It is not the Girl,
text: of course. She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: I'm not... want to see?
text: She pulls the cloth away. She has carved the cult SIGIL into
text: her FLESH. The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer
text: retreats to the door, and exits back out into --
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
text: Pimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He
text: is ashen with terror. Jennifer snatches the crucifix from
text: his white-knuckled fingers.
speaker_heading: PIMM
dialog: He's going to kill us all...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Where did Swann go?
text: Pimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY
text: Swann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to
text: his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side.
text: He turns the door handle.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
text: Swann steps inside. Nix's chair has its back to him. The
text: folds of Nix's robe are visible, however. Swann hears a
text: muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room.
text: On the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.
text: Swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible. As
text: he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching!
text: He reaches for his gun. The chair topples. The Baboon, half
text: dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann.
text: Swann FIRES at it. The bullet blasts off half its head.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
text: On Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the
text: passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: Stay the fuck away!
dialog: (yells)
dialog: Pimm! Get over here!
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
text: PAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he
text: struggles with the Girl's gag. He has laid his gun on the
text: ground beside her.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: You're going to be okay.
text: Out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings
text: round. Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque
dialog: altarpiece.
text: The Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder. Terror crosses her
text: face. Swann turns.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: I knew you'd come.
text: He reaches down to Swann.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: I've got so much power to give
dialog: you, Swann. All you have to do
dialog: is...beg.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: You don't think I've got it to
dialog: give?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: No!
text: Suddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying
dialog: gravity.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: You're wrong.
text: He catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back
text: against the wall.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: I could eat your fucking soul,
dialog: Swann.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
text: Jennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum. Butterfield steps
text: from the shadows. His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's
text: hand. BLOOD SPURTS.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Fuck!
text: She retreats, staunching her bleeding hand.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
text: Nix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his
text: fingers against Swann's temples. Working, working, like a
text: psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: You want to know what the world
dialog: really looks like?
text: Swann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold.
text: And now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin
text: of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Want to see flesh with a god's
dialog: eyes?
text: Swann SCREAMS as Nix's mind-hold seizes him.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
text: Quaid levels his gun at Butterfield, who is guarding the
text: Sanctum door. Jennifer is at Quaid's side.
speaker_heading: SWANN (V.O.)
dialog: Aah!
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: Get away from the door!
text: Butterfield shakes his head. Quaid FIRES. The bullet.
text: strikes the wall beside Butterfield's head. He retreats,
text: growling like a rabid animal. Quaid kicks the Sanctum door
text: open, and enters.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: Swann?
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (to Quaid)
dialog: Here he is.
text: Swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his
text: eyes blood-red.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Take a look, Swann! These are your
dialog: friends.
text: On Swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at Quaid and
dialog: Jennifer.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (V.O.)
dialog: What have you done to him?
speaker_heading: SWANN'S P.O.V.
text: of Quaid and Jennifer. To Swann's eyes, their faces seem to
text: be MORPHING. Their humanity is MELTING AWAY. What's left is
text: like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes: PRIMEVAL MUCK.
speaker_heading: QUAID (V.O.)
dialog: Swann. It's okay.
text: Quaid reaches for Swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his
text: head violently.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Don't touch me. He's got... got
dialog: into my head.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: You want to be like that, Swann?
dialog: Mud and shit?
text: Swann turns away from Quaid and Jennifer in disgust.
speaker_heading: SWANN'S P.O.V.
text: of Nix, his arms outstretched in welcome. His face has an
text: aura of pulsing light.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Come here. Share the power.
text: ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom. The trigger is
dialog: pulled.
text: The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest.
text: ON SWANN, staring at Nix.
text: SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies.
text: Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses
text: something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features. A NIGHTMARE
text: FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its
dialog: forehead.
text: Swann covers his eyes.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (raging, terrifying)
dialog: Swann! Swann!
text: Nix staggers, letting out an ungodly HOWL, and drops to his
text: knees, clutching the WOUND. As he falls, he reveals the
text: ashen Girl, who is still holding Swann's smoking GUN.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (a roar)
dialog: Help me!
text: Swann shakes his head, ridding himself of Nix's mind-
dialog: control.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Jesus-
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE SANCTUM - DAY
text: Pinon stands guard, his gun pointed on several cultists.
speaker_heading: 1ST CULTIST
dialog: (with distressing
dialog: confidence)
dialog: You can't kill him.
speaker_heading: 2ND CULTIST
dialog: He'll just rise up again!
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
text: On Nix, doing just that: rising up. Right hand clamped to
text: his bloody chest, left hand reaching for Swann.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Help me!
text: Quaid FIRES at him again. Strikes his shoulder. And again.
text: Strikes his leg. Nix collapses to the ground,
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Quickly!
text: They have come prepared for this. Swann now takes from his
text: jacket the three strange pieces of METALWORK. There are
text: SCREWS in then all.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (seeing)
dialog: Swann? What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Binding you.
text: He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES. It fits like an
text: eyeless mask. Nix thrashes and SCREAMS. Swann lays his
text: hands on the side of the mask, and  LIKE MAGIC -- his touch
text: makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into
text: Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND. BLOOD runs
text: from the screw-holes.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Fuck you, Swann! Fuck you!
text: Now the second piece, over his MOUTH.
speaker_heading: NIX
speaker_heading: Sw
text: He's silenced. The piece screws itself into-his head, like
text: the first. And now comes the third and final piece: over
text: the nose and into the ears. Again, it screws itself into
dialog: place.
text: Swann has done all he can. He retreats from Nix's body, as
text: it continues to convulse. We go from face to ashen face, as
text: each man and woman watches and waits. Why won't he die?
text: And now, at last the violence of Nix's death-throes
text: diminishes. Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the
text: ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Is it finished?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: It's finished.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY
text: The Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix
text: had upon them has disappeared. Then they start to retreat,
dialog: their confidence and courage gone.
text: Pimm steps into the Sanctum.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY
text: The five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's
text: body. Swann has his arm around the Girl.
speaker_heading: PIMM
dialog: Dead?
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: Dead.
speaker_heading: PIMM
dialog: What now?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: We bury him so deep no one will
dialog: ever find him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NIX'S .HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - DUSK
text: The wind has died away. It's eerily calm. Butterfield
text: dashes towards camera, then halts.
text: HE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE
text: into the back of Murray Pimm's bus.
text: ON Butterfield. He watches, with a feral look on his face.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY
text: The city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and
text: gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking
dialog: some fantastical metropolis. This, for all its smog and
text: congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments.
text: ON SCREEN, the words: "LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER"
scene_heading: EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DAY
text: The facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs
text: a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but
dialog: it has a certain charm.
scene_heading: INT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY
text: A large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a
text: host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby.
text: At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands
text: HARRY D'AMOUR. He is having difficulty getting the pretty
text: but vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: BLONDE GIRL
dialog: How'd you spell that again?
speaker_heading: HARRY
scene_heading: D.A.M.O.U.R. D'Amour. Harry
dialog: D'Amour.
speaker_heading: BLONDE GIRL
dialog: D'Amour.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: BLONDE GIRL
dialog: Isn't that French for something?
text: ON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Mister D'Amour?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Blonde)
dialog: Yeah. It's French.
speaker_heading: BLONDE GIRL
dialog: For love, right?
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Mister D'Amour?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Blonde)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: BLONDE GIRL
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: That's so cool.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Mister D'Amour?
text: Harry turns. He's wearing a washed-out Grateful Dead t-
text: shirt, an Italian cut linen suit, and glasses. He's
text: handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: You haven't paid the cab. He won't
dialog: give us your bags 'til you pay him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Thirty-five bucks.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Tell him he can keep them. The
text: Bellboy looks puzzled.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just kidding.
text: Harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten-dollar
dialog: bills.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I've got my life in there.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: On the suit-case, which is now on the bed. Harry flings it
text: open. Inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection
text: of items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet. A GUN. A
text: CRUCIFIX. A STATUE of Shiva, the Hindu Lord of creation and
dialog: destruction.
text: ON HARRY, as he heads into the bathroom. Turns on the
text: shower. Starts to undress.
scene_heading: EXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DUSK
text: Harry, his hair still wet from his shower, steps out into the
text: sun. Squints. Puts on sunglasses.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hello, L.A.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You bet.
scene_heading: EXT. MELROSE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a
text: classy restaurant. It's RAINING.
text: ON TAPERT, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty
text: WOMAN opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window.
text: Tapert makes a joke (unheard). The woman laughs.
text: ON HARRY, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape
dialog: recorder.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nine-eighteen p.m. Tapert's either
dialog: got a great sense of humour or he's
text: paying her to laugh.
dialog: (looks at hamburger in
dialog: disgust)
dialog: Jesus.
text: On Tapert, as he rises from the table.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (into tape recorder)
text: He's finished.
text: Tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street. Harry
text: tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car.
scene_heading: EXT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT
text: Harry pulls the parking ticket off the windshield, screws it
text: up and gets in.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S CAR - MELROSE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (into tape)
text: Nine twenty-six p.m. He's off
dialog: again.
text: He turns the key in the ignition.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - SILVERLAKE - NIGHT
text: In neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window. It
scene_heading: reads: TAROT CARD AND CRYSTAL READINGS - $15 SPECIAL
text: ON TAPERT, as he hurries across the street, and through the
text: door beside the store window.
text: WE PAN OFF the door as Harry's car comes to a halt on the far
text: side of the street.
text: Harry gets out of the car. Stares at the sign in the window,
dialog: puzzled.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Superstitious?
text: He starts across the street. Suddenly:
speaker_heading: TAPERT (V.O.)
dialog: Oh my God!
text: Tapert emerges, his face white with terror. He stumbles to
text: his car, and he's away. Harry freezes, caught between the
text: need to follow Tapert and sheer curiosity. He gives in to the
text: latter, and steps inside.
scene_heading: INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: An illuminated ARROW points up the stairs. Harry ascends,
text: past faded PHOTOGRAPHS of Caspar Quaid with famous faces.
text: At the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. Harry
text: halts, and takes out his GUN.
text: There's a strange RUMBLING SOUND approaching from round the
text: corner. Harry chances a look. There's a short length of
text: passageway, leading to an open door. From the threshold a
text: CRYSTAL BALL rolls towards Harry, BLOOD- SMEARED. This is
text: the source of the rumbling. Harry stops the ball before it
text: falls down the stairs.
text: Dead silence. After a beat, Harry creeps towards the open
text: door. He pushes it open. Inside, chaos. The fake antique
text: FURNITURE is splintered, the ASTRAL CHARTS slashed.
scene_heading: INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
text: There are two offices. In the front, a Waiting Room, into
text: which Harry now steps. Beyond it, through a door that stands
text: narrowly ajar, the Fortune Telling Room.
text: From out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN.
speaker_heading: QUAID (V.O.)
dialog: Ahh. . .
text: Harry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for
text: his gun. Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the
dialog: shadows.
text: His name is RAY MILLER. He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth
text: sharpened, eyes wild. Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle
text: of his forehead. He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and
text: goes for his throat.
text: Harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST
text: and SMASHES it on Miller's skull.
text: Miller reels back. Harry makes a dash for the door to the
dialog: Fortune Telling Room.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Fuckhead.
scene_heading: INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT
text: A mysterious, candle-lit space. In the middle of the room, a
text: table. At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been
text: tortured close to death. Several small SCALPELS protrude
text: from his chest and neck. His life is ebbing away. On the
text: table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED.
text: Harry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room.

dialog: What the fuck!?
text: Harry picks up the PHONE. It's dead. Miller charges at the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shit!
text: Harry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it.
text: As he does so, the candles FLICKER. Harry looks up. A
text: FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid. He's in his
text: late twenties: an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long
text: hair is drawn back into a pony-tail. His mismatched eyes -
text: one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield.
text: His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Butterfield)
dialog: Don't touch him."
text: Butterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek. Quaid sobs
dialog: in pain.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: What are you going to do about it?
text: Miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
text: other side. His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock
text: out. Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: Ever watched a man die? If you
dialog: watch very closely, you can
text: sometimes see the soul escaping.
dialog: And if you're very quick, you can
dialog: catch it.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: Please... Butterfield... I wasn't
dialog: there. Ask Pimm.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's
dialog: disappeared. They knew the Puritan
dialog: was coming home.
text: As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the
text: door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other
text: side. It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being
text: pitched across the room. He looks around for some means of
text: defense. There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the
text: table. Behind it a WINDOW.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: So do you. You've seen the future.
dialog: Haven't you?
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: And are you afraid?
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: Yes.
text: Suddenly, Harry steps aside. The door's flung open. Miller
text: CHARGES in. Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him
text: against the drape. The window CRACKS; the drape comes down
text: around Miller. Amber STREETLIGHT floods in.
text: Butterfield is momentarily distracted. Harry STRIKES the
text: scalpel from his hands.
text: Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the
text: folds of the drapes. Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's
text: belly. Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window,
text: which SHATTERS. Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT.
text: Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already
text: making his escape. Harry starts after him.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: Don't leave me.
text: He turns back. TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry
text: goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the
dialog: stairs.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You need an ambulance.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: (in pain)
dialog: Too late. Why are you here? Did
dialog: you cone... up here for a reading?
text: Quaid takes hold of Harry's hand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: NO ... I...
text: Quaid stares at Harry's HAND. Fascinated, he momentarily
text: forgets his pain. He traces the lines with bloody fingers.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: My God.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: You've taken some strange
dialog: journeys in your life.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah. You could say that.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: You're drawn to the dark side, over
dialog: and over. And it's drawn to you.
dialog: (looks at Harry)
dialog: You don't like that.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not much.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: You can't change it. You have to
dialog: walk...
dialog: (coughs)
dialog: ...walk the line between Heaven and
dialog: Hell. It's your destiny. Accept
dialog: it.
text: Harry takes his hand from Quaid's grip. Quaid winces in
dialog: pain.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hold on.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: I'm not afraid to die. There's
dialog: something terrible... coming
dialog: home...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: The Puritan?
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who is he?
text: Quaid shudders, and dies.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (softly; sadly)
dialog: Shit.
text: He looks away, down at the CARDS. All have been turned over
text: but ONE. He turns it. The card is the Ten of Swords which
text: pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by
text: all ten swords. An image of death and desolation.
scene_heading: EXT. QUAID'S OFFICES - ALLEY BEHIND BUILDING - NIGHT
text: The flashing LIGHTS of two patrol cars illuminate the scene.
text: DETECTIVE EDDISON, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut
text: blond hair, heads along the alley with Harry. He's midway
text: through taking Harry's statement. There are already two
text: OFFICERS examining the drapes. We can't yet see the body.
speaker_heading: EDDISON
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: What were you doing up there?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm a private detective. I was
dialog: hired to follow somebody for a few
dialog: days. A guy called Tapert.
dialog: Insurance fraud.
speaker_heading: EDDISON
dialog: (writing)
dialog: Tapert. So, now I've got Tapert,
dialog: Butterfield.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Tapert's got nothing to do with
dialog: this. He came here to get his palm
dialog: read.
speaker_heading: EDDISON
dialog: What makes you so sure?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I got a file on him two inches
dialog: thick. He's a petty fraudster.
dialog: This is something else. Ever heard
dialog: of someone called the Puritan?
speaker_heading: EDDISON
dialog: New one on me.
dialog: (to Officer)
dialog: Okay. Let's see him.
text: OFFICER #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. Broken
text: GLASS drops from the folds, but that's all. Miller has gone.
speaker_heading: EDDISON
dialog: Where the fuck is he?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He got up and walked.
speaker_heading: EDDISON
dialog: (looking up at window)
dialog: After that fall?. He must have

text: WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, as he stares down at the drape.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't think he'd have given a
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUTTERFIELD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The rooms are spartan. Nothing on the walls. Nothing on the
text: floors. Very little furniture.
text: Butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his
text: long hair. There is something feminine about him now: his
text: voice a whisper, his stare distracted. If we didn't guess it
dialog: already, we're in the presence of a madman.
text: Miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of GLASS
text: out of his torso. It hurts, but he's enjoying himself.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know
dialog: that name?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I know him. I saw him.
text: He stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass,
text: sighing with pleasure.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: I saw him on T.V. Some kid got
dialog: possessed and he saved the little
dialog: bastard's life.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: He's a priest?
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: No. He's just a guy who's got a
dialog: nose for this shit.
text: (a beat. A smirk)
dialog: Like you.
text: A long beat of silence. Butterfield combs. Miller digs for
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: I don't want him getting in the
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: He won't.
dialog: Another silence.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: We've all of us waited too long to

speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: What do you mean, "all of us?"
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: You didn't think it was just going

speaker_heading: DOROTHEA

speaker_heading: SWANN (V.O.)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen. You are
text: standing on the threshold of a
dialog: miracle...
text: A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the
dialog: stage.
dialog: The vortex BLAZES --
text: And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor
text: of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor
text: toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE.
text: Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR
text: miraculously appears in his grasp. He descends on the
text: dragon. It's a classic image: St. Michael smiting the
text: Devil. Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon.
text: The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS. Then the head cracks
text: open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily
text: dressed DANCERS, male and female. Swann throws down the
text: spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears.
text: A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience. Swann's plain white
text: tunic falls away from him as he descends. By the time his
text: feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO.
text: The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a
text: crescendo. The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance. In the
text: sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: My friends ... come with me...into
dialog: the Great Beyond.
text: A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt.
text: The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly.
text: ON HARRY and Dorothea.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He's good.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: You haven't seen anything yet.
scene_heading: INT. WILTERN THEATRE - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: The doors SQUEAK as a gust of WIND blows through them.
text: Butterfield stands in the lobby, listening to the muted
text: SOUNDS of MUSIC and APPLAUSE. Then he offers his ticket to
text: the TICKET-COLLECTOR and steps inside.
scene_heading: INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT
text: A new musical motif hangs in the air: MUSIC announcing
dialog: danger.
text: The AUDIENCE watches intently, nervously.
text: ON HARRY and DOROTHEA.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: This is the new illusion.
text: ON STAGE, Swann is bound to a spinning WHEEL, while the
text: DANCERS, dressed like Boschian DEMONS, cavort around him,
text: somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow FLAME.
text: It's a scene from Daniels Inferno. Above him. a dozen
text: glittering SWORDS - six feet long - are descending. He
text: struggles to free himself. The MUSIC gets more exciting as
text: the wheel spins faster and faster.
text: Suddenly, a sword DROPS. It falls between Swann's
text: outstretched legs, skewering the wheel. Then ANOTHER, close
text: to his head.
text: ON HARRY. He's tense. Excited.
text: BACK TO STAGE. Swann is free I He throws off the last
text: shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the
text: wheel. There's a theatrical BLAZE of white-hot SPARKS.
text: The wheel slows. He starts to step off it, as another of the
text: the swords DROPS.
text: The AUDIENCE GASPS. Swann smiles, and TRIPS.
text: As he FALLS, the sword runs through the middle of his back,
text: carrying him down to the still-spinning wheel, and pinning
text: him there. Some of the DANCERS continue to cavort. Some
dialog: stop.
text: More GASPS from the audience.
dialog: ON HARRY, having a --
text: FLASHBACK: Harry's hand turns over the final tar of card.
text: The scene on the stage is that image coming to life.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: There's something wrong...
text: ON Swann, as a second sword FALLS, skewering his thigh, and a
text: third, running through his buttock, and a fourth and fifth,
text: until TEN SWORDS have entered his body.
text: ON THE AUDIENCE, not certain whether this is a trick or not.
text: The MUSIC has stopped. In the silence, somebody GIGGLES
text: nervously. A couple of PEOPLE break into APPLAUSE, but it
text: dies away in a matter of moments.
scene_heading: ON DOROTHEA AND HARRY
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: No. . .
text: ON THE STAGE, Swann raises his head and looks out at his
text: wife, his eyes already glassy with imminent death. He
text: reaches out towards her, and then sags on the wheel, dead.
text: There are GASPS now from the audience. Murmurs of disgust;
text: sobs of horror.
scene_heading: 1ST AUDIENCE MEMBER
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: 2ND AUDIENCE MEMBER
dialog: It's a trick.
scene_heading: 3RD AUDIENCE MEMBER
dialog: Somebody help him.
text: The curtains start to close.
text: ON Dorothea, tears of shock filling her eyes.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: I've got to get to him!
text: The AUDIENCE is rising now, as the horror of what they've
text: seen sinks in. There is panic. A few people have fainted.
text: One or two are even praying.
text: Harry carves out a path down to the stage for Dorothea
text: against the flood of the exiting crowd.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Out of the way! Out of the way!
text: He helps Dorothea onto the stage, and lifts the curtain so
text: she can duck beneath it.
scene_heading: INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT
text: Chaos. PEOPLE running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing
text: watching. Valentin is already at the body, with the STAGE
text: MANAGER at his side.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: (to Stage Manager)
dialog: Get then out of here, for God's
dialog: sake --
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: You heard him! It's not a fucking
dialog: show!
text: He starts to physically push the crowd back. Harry grabs his
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: STAGE MANAGER
dialog: Who are you?
text: Harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the STAGE
text: MANAGER out of Dorothea's way. She goes to Swann's body,
text: which has been removed from the wheel.
scene_heading: INT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
text: The audience is clearing now. But Butterfield is coming
text: towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he
dialog: enraged? Or puzzled? Or both?
speaker_heading: MILLER
speaker_heading: Psst!
text: Miller stands at an open door, leading below the stage.
text: Butterfield enters.
scene_heading: INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT
text: Dorothea kneels at Swann's side. A few yards from her, Harry
text: examines the mechanism of the wheel.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Swann...
text: A DOCTOR appears.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I'm a doctor. Let me through.
text: The Doctor checks Swann's body.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (to Dorothea)
dialog: I'm sorry...
text: Harry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device.
text: He's suspicious. He slips round to the back of the
text: mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the
text: cable as he goes.
scene_heading: WILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT
text: It's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are
dialog: used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the
text: beginning. From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted
text: and echoing.
text: The cable ends in bare wires. Whatever was here has been
dialog: taken.
text: A NOISE, behind Harry. He swings round. Sees a shadowy
text: FIGURE ducking away.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hey!
text: He gives chase. Loses the man in the shadows. Stops and
dialog: listens for movement.
text: Suddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of
text: wood and smashes it into Harry's face!
text: Harry reels back. Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his
text: nose. Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Got you, fucker!
text: Harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed. And now, out of
text: the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Who did this, D'Amour? Who killed
dialog: Swann?
text: Harry is barely holding on to consciousness.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You did.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Didn't you?
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Why would I do that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Beats me.
text: Butterfield is a foot from Harry now.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: You don't have a clue what you're
dialog: into, do you?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Deep shit?
text: Butterfield hits him.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Who did this?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I told you --
text: Butterfield hits him again.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Who did this?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (raises his hand)
dialog: All right. It was...
text: Butterfield comes a little closer.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (feigning a near collapse)
dialog: ... it was...
text: Butterfield leans in. And Harry grabs him by the balls --
text: literally -- rising as he does so.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Aah!
text: Harry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground
text: in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from
text: Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun.
text: He FIRES once, missing Harry by inches. Harry catches hold
text: of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who
text: TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon. The GUN GOES
text: OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW
speaker_heading: MECHANISM.
text: Miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the
text: dragon's steel teeth. He has Harry in his sights.
text: -- something CREAKS. He looks up. The dragon's jaw is
text: closing, FAST. He starts to scramble to his feet. Too late!
text: The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body. Sudden death.
text: Harry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the
text: shadows. Then he's gone. Harry looks down at Miller's
text: BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Deep shit...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - EDDISON'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Harry sits at Eddison's desk, looking exhausted and bruised.
text: Eddison has just finished taking his statement.
speaker_heading: EDDISON
dialog: And this Butterfield guy--
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: --vanished.
speaker_heading: EDDISON
dialog: (frustrated sigh)
dialog: Another fucking magician. Jesus.
text: Harry looks past Eddison and sees an ashen, tearful Dorothea
text: being taken into another office.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are you finished with me?
speaker_heading: EDDISON
dialog: For now. Are you planning to go
dialog: back to New York?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (watching Dorothea)
dialog: No. Not yet...
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - OTHER OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall. Harry enters.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are they treating you okay?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I heard what happened. It looks
dialog: like somebody murdered him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm sorry I got into this too late.
dialog: But if you want me to stick around,
dialog: maybe dig where the cops don't
dialog: look...
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I don't know where you'd start.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well... how about some of the other
dialog: illusionists?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: They won't tell you anything.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I can be very persuasive.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Yes. I think you probably can.
dialog: (another beat)
dialog: We'd need to talk about your fee.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Forget the fee. If I find
dialog: Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about
dialog: money. If I don't...
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: ...my gamble. Either way... I
dialog: get to spend some time... here.
text: The way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean L.A., it
text: means near -Dorothea. And by the tiny smile on her face,
dialog: it's also plain she knows it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAGIC SHOP - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY
text: Noon. Bright sun. Busy street. Harry, now wearing a
text: bandage on his cut face, enters.
scene_heading: INT. MAGIC SHOP - DAY
text: A wonderland for illusionists. Books, props, masks, tricks,
text: etc. Two or three CUSTOMERS browse. Harry glances at them
text: all, then targets a MAN in late middle age, who is browsing
text: through books, one-handed. His other hand constantly
text: manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen
text: ways. He doesn't even look at his hand. His name is WALTER
speaker_heading: WILDER.
text: Harry stands beside him. Scans the shelf.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Where'd you learn that?
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (points)
dialog: That.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: At birth. I don't know you --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Harry D'Amour.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: I know all the kids coming up. Got
dialog: to stay ahead of the game. But I
dialog: don't know you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm in from New York. I came to
dialog: see Swann.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: What a tragedy. It was just a
dialog: matter of time, of course, but it's
dialog: not good for the business.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Was he taking a lot of risks?
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: You don't know the half of it. I'm
dialog: Walter Wilder, by the way.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not the Walter Wilder?
text: Walter beams.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: The one and only.
text: He hands Harry a card.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: Want to try?
text: Harry tries to emulate Wilder's card manipulation through the
dialog: rest of this conversation.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: You know Vinovich?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (not a clue)
dialog: Sure. Vivovich.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: He knew Swann way back. He says
dialog: there were a lot of drugs, a lot of
dialog: crazy shit.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'd love to... you know... hang
dialog: with some of you guys.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: People are pretty cagey. Who do
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: For an introduction.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well... nobody.
text: Wilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to
text: manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: (magnanimously)
dialog: You do now.
scene_heading: EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK
text: The castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm.
text: Harry and Walter wander towards the front door. Harry is
text: knotting a newly-bought tie.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I only wear ties for funerals.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: You don't get in without one. It's
dialog: like a gentlemen's club for
dialog: illusionists. Except most of us
dialog: aren't gentlemen.
scene_heading: INT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT
text: The interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with
dialog: illusionists' posters.
text: Walter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms
text: where illusionists are performing close-up magic for
text: audiences of well-heeled patrons. Walter nods and waves to
text: half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the
text: stairs and towards the bar.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are they all in the business?
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: It's not a business. Harry. It's a
dialog: vocation.
text: Wilder points to a locked door.
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: That's what they call the
dialog: Repository. Every magic secret
dialog: known to man's locked up in that
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Have you been in?
speaker_heading: WILDER
dialog: No. There's only three keys.
dialog: Vinovich has got one, of
dialog: course.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's a little crazy, by the way.
dialog: And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise,
dialog: he's a real charmer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: INT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT
text: Later. A drunken VINOVICH is holding court. He's in his
text: 40's: a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and
text: fake) middle-European accent. At the table - besides Harry
dialog: and Walter - are: Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend
text: LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and
text: two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown,
text: overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin,
text: waspish fellow in a spangly suit: the AMAZING QUENTIN.
text: In the conversation that follows we go back to Harry
text: repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: It's more than entertainment. We're
text: opening people's heads up. Putting
dialog: miracles back into their boring
dialog: little lives.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: But they're fake miracles.
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: Houdini believed he had spirit
dialog: guides.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You believe that?
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: I think we walk a narrow path,
dialog: between... between...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Heaven and Hell?
text: Vinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether
text: he's being sarcastic or not.
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
text: Trickery and divinity.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Are you saying that sometimes
dialog: the miracles are real?
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: No. I'm saying they were always
dialog: fake. The saints, the messiahs,
dialog: they were just illusionists.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So could you walk on water?
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: (deadly serious)
dialog: I could reproduce any miracle
dialog: that's ever been performed, with a
dialog: little preparation.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What about Swann's miracles?
text: The smug smile on Vinovich's face dies. Furtive glances are
text: exchanged around the table. Only Billy Who makes a tiny
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: They weren't worth a damn.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (goading)
dialog: I heard he was the best.
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: If he was so good why's he so dead?
text: Vinovich begins to look suspicious.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You tell me. No? I thought you'd
dialog: maybe have a theory.
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: Oh, I've got plenty.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'd like to hear them.
text: Vinovich rises.
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: I'm not saying another word.
dialog: (to Wilder)
dialog: You damn fool. He's a
dialog: journalist.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just tell me about Swann. Or are
dialog: you too scared?
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: He was a freak. Everything he did
dialog: was tainted.
text: Harry rises. Looks straight at Vinovich, unintimidated.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: With what?
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: Evil. He was evil.
dialog: (to Laura)
dialog: Come on.
text: She rises.
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: (to the rest)
dialog: Say nothing to this man if you wish
dialog: to keep my company.
text: He stalks away. Harry calls after him, across a now-
text: silenced bar.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Great accent, by the way. Is it
dialog: Brooklyn?
speaker_heading: VINOVICH
dialog: (pure Brooklyn)
dialog: Fuck you.
scene_heading: EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Harry heads to the car.
speaker_heading: BILLY (V.O.)
dialog: Harry!
text: Harry turns. Billy approaches, glancing behind him to see
text: that he's not being watched.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I gotta be careful. If Vinovich
dialog: sees me talking to you. He's an
dialog: asshole, but he's a powerful
dialog: asshole.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: They go together.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (lowered voice)
dialog: I've heard a name. Someone they
text: talk about in whispers.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Nix.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nix?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Like in nothing. Nobody. Nix.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I think maybe he taught Swann.
dialog: (hands Harry a card)
dialog: This is me. See ya around.
text: Billy hurries away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Harry lies on his bed, dozing. The CAMERA CREEPS IN on him.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA (V.O.)
dialog: ... I want somebody who can find
dialog: out what Philip saw in those damn
dialog: cards...
text: Harry frowns in his semi-doze.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Ever watched a man die?
text: The image darkens, and fades up a beat later on Quaid.
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: Please... I wasn't there... Ask
dialog: Pimm.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's
dialog: disappeared...
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Harry is still asleep.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - QUAID'S ROOM
speaker_heading: QUAID
dialog: I'm not afraid to die. There's
dialog: something terrible... coming
dialog: home...
text: A long silence.
text: SUDDENLY, a telephone RINGS.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: HARRY sits up, shocked awake.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shit!
text: He picks up the receiver.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This is D'Amour.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: She sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing
text: else, drinking a SCOTCH, talking on the phone. The primary
text: source of illumination is the massive T.V. set in the wall
text: opposite the bed.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Harry... I know it's late.
scene_heading: INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION
text: There should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange.
text: Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by
text: the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and
dialog: touch them.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's okay.
text: As he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title
text: page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: How did it go today?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I went up to the Magic Castle. You
dialog: were right. He didn't have a lot
dialog: of fans up there.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Valentin, on the kitchen PHONE, is listening in.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA (V.O.)
dialog: They were jealous of him.
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Why? Because he had you?
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INTERCUTTING: HARRY - DOROTHEA - VALENTIN
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: He... didn't have me.. I told you-
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You didn't marry him for love.
scene_heading: DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM
text: She's a little uncomfortable now.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So why did you marry him?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: That's my business. Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just curious.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Back to business. Ever heard of a
dialog: man called Nix?
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Dorothea?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Yes... I'm here. And no. I don't
dialog: know the name.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What about Jennifer Desiderio?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: It doesn't ring a bell. I have to
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay. I'll keep digging.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (uneasy)
dialog: Yes. You do that.
text: She puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch.
text: She's shaking. She gets up. Paces the room. Then she picks
text: up the phone again.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: On the pad beside the bed, Jennifer's name, surrounded by
text: Harry's doodles. The phone RINGS.
text: CUT WIDE: The room is empty.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: The Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry
text: heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of
text: Quaid's Waiting Room.
text: It has been locked and taped by the police. Harry has come
text: prepared. He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the
dialog: locks.
scene_heading: INT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT
text: Harry enters, FLASHLIGHT on. He crosses the Waiting Room and
text: enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died. On the
text: TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS,
text: Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the
text: blood-spattered table:
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
dialog: If you watch very closely, you can
text: sometimes see the soul escaping.
text: Harry is spooked. He starts to search the room, opening
text: cabinets and drawers. Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac
text: are stashed everywhere. Boxes of crystals, religious
text: statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.
text: He pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged
text: in a niche at the base of the drawer. He pulls the drawer
text: out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it.
text: Using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart. It has a
dialog: false bottom.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yes...
text: In the secret compartment, some papers and an address book.
text: He flicks to "D."
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Desiderio...
text: There it is. Jennifer Desiderio, and an address. He pockets
text: the book. Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out
text: his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing --
dialog: -- Valentin!
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: What the fuck are you doing here?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Looking for you. I tried the
dialog: hotel.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why'd you come here?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: You're a detective, with no clues.
dialog: Where else are you going to look?
dialog: I'm going to keep this brief.
dialog: (he takes out an envelope)
dialog: Here's thirty thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: A ticket home,
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You didn't hire me. She did.
dialog: If she wants me off the job, I
dialog: want to hear it from her.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: She doesn't want to see you. She's
dialog: had enough pain. Enough churning
dialog: over the past. She wants it all
dialog: left alone.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Left alone? Somebody's been
dialog: murdered.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Yes. It's regrettable
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Fuck regrettable! I want to know
dialog: why.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What for? You need to stay busy?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (a confession)
dialog: I like to know why things happen.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Why people die?
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Give it up, D'Amour. Go home.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No.
text: Harry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Don't try and see her, D'Amour.
dialog: Just leave her alone. Let her
dialog: heal.
text: He glances back at Valentin.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Lock up, will you?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM, PASADENA - DAY
text: ON THE ADDRESS BOOK, in Harry's hands.
text: Harry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a
text: building, the sign on which reads, "St. Luke's Sanitorium".
scene_heading: INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY
text: The place is bland and functional throughout, the walls
text: decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings.
text: Nothing disturbing. Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER -
text: black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse.
speaker_heading: TOFFLER
dialog: Jennifer's only ever had one
dialog: visitor.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A Mister Quaid?
speaker_heading: TOFFLER
dialog: Right. And he's dead, isn't he? I
dialog: saw it on the news. Jennifer
dialog: doesn't know. And frankly, this
dialog: isn't the best tine for her to be
dialog: told.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I won't say anything.
scene_heading: INT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY
text: Toffler excorts Harry through -the place. There are
text: distressing scenes on every side. Nothing melodramatic no
text: screaming, no fits. Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair.
text: Blank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms.
speaker_heading: TOFFLER
dialog: Jennifer's been with us four years.
text: She was coming on nicely.
dialog: But just the last month or so,
dialog: she's worse than ever.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What's her problem?
speaker_heading: TOFFLER
text: She has no real grip on reality.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (a joke)
dialog: Does anybody?
speaker_heading: TOFFLER
dialog: (deadly serious)
dialog: Oh yes. We have to agree what's
dialog: real and what's not. That's what
dialog: holds us together.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And what does Jennifer think's
dialog: real?
text: They've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting
text: outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us.
speaker_heading: TOFFLER
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming
dialog: for her.
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Jennifer?
text: Jennifer turns. She looks terrible.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY
text: Harry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the
text: Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout
text: the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which
text: steadily gets louder as they walk.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Have we met before?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Only I forget. They give me pills,
dialog: you know, to keep me... even...
dialog: and... I forget things,
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, you didn't forget me. I just
dialog: came because I wanted to know if
dialog: you knew a man called Butterfield.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Maybe... I... don't...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What about Philip Swann?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I knew Swann.
dialog: (sudden vehemence)
dialog: He's a fucking liar.
text: A WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Why's that?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: He said he knew how to protect us.
dialog: But he didn't know anything. He
dialog: made us think it was over and done
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What is?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (tears nearing)
dialog: I don't want to think about it. If
dialog: I think about it he'll hear me.
dialog: He'll find me.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Swann?
text: Ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,
text: laying pipes. The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but
dialog: we're aware of it.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I told you. I don't --
text: She stops. Looks ahead of her. Her face is suddenly ashen
text: and clammy. Harry follows her gaze to:
text: The hole. Somebody is in it, digging. Earth emerges in
text: shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: God no! Oh God no!
text: She backs away from the hole. The Nurse grabs hold of her.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Calm down!
text: She delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE. The Nurse is flung
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: He's not going to get me!
text: She races down towards the street. Harry goes after her.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: He's not! He's not!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who's not?
text: He catches up with her.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Nix! Nix!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Is he the Puritan?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yes! Yes!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And he's dead?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: No. He's coming back. He's
dialog: digging his way out!
text: The Nurse appears behind Harry.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I'll take care of her now.
text: Jennifer struggles in Harry's grip.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!
text: The Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away
text: instantly, racing towards the street.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Jennifer!
text: She scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the
text: top. There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of
text: metalwork and glass. Harry gets to the wall before the
text: Nurse. Hoists himself up onto it. Looks down.
scene_heading: HARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET
text: Jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the
text: wheels of a car. The DRIVER is out, and yelling
text: incoherently.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Jesus.
text: He slips back down the wall, and leans against it.
text: He looks towards the hole. The Workman has stopped digging.
text: His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his
text: head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
text: a grave. Harry closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (very quietly)
dialog: Jesus.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES - DUSK
text: The sun is setting, the city giving way to night.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK
text: Harry's on the phone.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I want to speak to Dorothea.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN (V.O.)
dialog: I'm afraid she's not in.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: When will she be in?
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT
text: Valentin on the phone in the study.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Who is it?
text: Valentin puts the phone down.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Crank call. I'll get the number
dialog: changed.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: No word from D'Amour?
text: Valentin shakes his head.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: It's better he's gone. He would
dialog: have done more harm than good.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Harm to whom? Me? I don't think,
dialog: so. Try him again at the hotel.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I left three messages already.
text: Dorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion. She turns
text: and leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: ON BILLY WHO'S CARD, in Harry's hand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Billy? It's Harry. Suppose I
dialog: wanted to get into the repository
dialog: at the Magic Castle?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MAGIC CASTLE - SKYLIGHT ROOM - NIGHT
text: THE PLACE IS EERIE BY NIGHT: ALL MASKS AND SHADOWS.
text: PAN UP TO THE SKYLIGHT. HARRY IS CUTTING AWAY A PANE OF
text: GLASS. BILLY'S BEHIND HIM. THE PANE STARTS TO FALL. WITH
text: LIGHTNING REFLEXES, BILLY REACHES THROUGH AND CATCHES IT.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You've done this before.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I've had my moments.
scene_heading: INT. MAGIC CASTLE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE REPOSITORY - NIGHT
text: Harry's manipulating the lock.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'm sure they'll have this place
text: rigged.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: It'll be something hokey.
text: CLICK! The door opens.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Houdini'd been proud of you.
scene_heading: INT. MAGIC CASTLE - REPOSITORY - NIGHT
text: Undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and
text: posters in every direction.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Whoa...
text: On the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS. In glass cases, the tools
text: of the great magicians: KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an
text: IRON MAIDEN. Billy is in awe. He wanders around wide-eyed
text: while Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they
dialog: investigate.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You heard right.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You ever been married?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah. She was killed in a car
text: crash. Her lawyer was driving. She
dialog: was filing for divorce.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: My life was too weird for her.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: I love weird.
text: Harry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Billy? This was on Miller's
dialog: forehead. Any idea what it is?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Nope.
text: Harry presses it. The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What did I tell you? So fucking
dialog: hokey.
text: Inside, there is a small shelf. On it, FILES and PAPERS.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What have we got here?
text: Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess. And --
text: two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm!
text: Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from
text: skewering Billy's flesh and bone! He keeps them open, his
text: sinews straining.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Grab the files!
text: Billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he
text: steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a
speaker_heading: CLANG!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Jesus!
text: He slams the files down. He's trembling.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I could have lost my fucking hands.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That would have kept you out of the
dialog: Magic Circle.
dialog: (he studies the files)
dialog: Which was presumably the idea.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: These are about Nix.
text: Harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You go through these. Go on!
text: Reluctantly, Billy does so. Harry picks up a faded
text: PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil
text: painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun.
text: There are other CULTISTS standing around. And in the DOORWAY
text: -- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for
dialog: that) - is NIX.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Wait a minute...
text: He stares at the boy's face. The eyes are clearly different
dialog: colours.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's Butterfield...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (points to nan in)
dialog: doorway)
dialog: And who's that?
text: ON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence.
text: ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: At a guess? The Puritan. Nix.
text: Billy picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty. It shows
text: a horror we recognize: a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH
text: of another man's HEAD.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Take a look at this.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (looking at it)
dialog: A Nix specialty?
text: Billy is getting subtly spooked now. He puts the etching
text: down and starts to go through others in the series. We
text: glimpse them as he does so. In one, a MAN regurgitates a
text: serpentine form made of FLAME. In another, a MAN stares at
text: his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH. There is no bone
text: beneath. Only a form of solid blackness. In a third, we see
text: a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating
scene_heading: DARKNESS.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I don't know any of these tricks...
text: Harry studies the etchings.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (a slow burn)
dialog: Maybe they're not tricks.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (mystified)
dialog: I mean, there's no instructions--
dialog: (realizes what Harry said)
dialog: What do you mean, they're not
dialog: tricks?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What did Vinovich say? Something
dialog: about walking a path between --
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Trickery and divinity. Yeah, he
dialog: says that all the time.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's because he knew. He'd seen
dialog: these files and knew.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Knew what?
text: Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the
text: book-stacks. Billy frowns. Harry puts his fingers to his
text: lips. Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away.
text: Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion.
text: Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks. A
text: figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.
text: Harry takes out his gun.
text: Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry
text: goes after the apparition.
text: The TRACK is completely silent.
text: Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy! It looks up,
text: its face that of a psychotic: burning eyes, manic smile.
text: It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who
text: backs away.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Harry!
text: Books tumble on top of Billy as he stumbles against the
dialog: shelves.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Where the fuck are you?
text: Harry appears, and puts his gun to the PSYCHO'S head.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay. Hold it right there.
text: The gun goes through the Psycho's skull, as though it's made
dialog: of smoke.
text: Harry waves his hands through it. It's completely ethereal.
text: But it's still terrorizing Billy.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (in mortal terror)
dialog: Get it off me!
text: Harry glances around. Sees a LIGHT flickering between some
text: books. FIRES at it. The light goes out. The "Psycho"
text: vanishes. Billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hokey enough for you?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I'm out of here, man! Are you
dialog: coming?
text: Harry picks up a handful of papers from the Nix file.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm coming.
text: Billy is already out of the room. For a moment. Harry pauses
text: to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked
dialog: gates.
dialog: As he does so --
text: -- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the
text: "Psycho" appears --ROARING - at Harry's shoulder.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Ah, shaddup!
text: He FIRES at the projector a second time.
dialog: On the GUN SHOT --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAGIC CASTLE - NIGHT
text: Billy and Harry are parting.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Thanks, Billy.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hey, anytime.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Actually, no. This was enough.
text: They shake, and part.
scene_heading: EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
text: Harry waits on the doorstep. Valentin opens the door.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I can't let you in.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (stepping in)
dialog: Yeah, I know.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: You want more money, is that it?
text: Harry pushes him aside.
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT
text: Harry starts to go through the house, opening doors.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Dorothea?
text: He sees candle-light through a partially open door. Starts
text: towards it.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Leave her alone --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shut up!
text: He pushes open the door.
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT
text: The room is a museum of Swarm's career. Posters, and
text: memorabilia everywhere. And in the middle of the room,
text: Swann's sealed CASKET, surrounded by flowers and candles.
text: Dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: This is the way he wanted it... no
dialog: autopsy, no embalming. Nobody
text: meddling with his body...
text: Harry approaches, slowly.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Flesh is a trap. That's what he
dialog: used to say. Flesh is a trap and
dialog: magic sets us free.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Why did you come back?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I didn't leave. I was just digging
dialog: around.
text: Dorothea looks up at him.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (uneasy)
dialog: What did you find?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Jennifer Desiderio, for one.
text: (he watches her for a
dialog: response)
text: She threw herself in front of a car
dialog: this afternoon.
text: Dorothea can't disguise her distress.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Oh Christ.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Why don't you tell me the truth?
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-
text: Dorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the
text: PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nix ran some kind of cult, right?
dialog: Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: It was more than that, I think.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He was the real thing, right?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Stuff?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: He could get into people's heads.
dialog: Make them see things. Terrible
dialog: things. And he could levitate.
text: Juggle fire.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He taught all this to Swann?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Some or it.
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT
text: Valentin is listening at the door.
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT-
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So Swann was performing magic. not
dialog: illusions?
dialog: (Dorothea nods)
dialog: And what? You thought he should be
dialog: using it to cure cancer, not making
dialog: millions.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I told you --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Too much fame. Yeah, I guess
dialog: that'd turn anybody's head.
dialog: Including yours.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You said you weren't with him for
dialog: love.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I wasn't.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What then?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I was grateful to him. I owed him
dialog: my life. And he loved me. He
dialog: couldn't always show it, but he
dialog: felt it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He thought Nix was coming back,
dialog: didn't he?
text: Dorothea is pouring herself another drink. The glass slips
text: from her hand. It SHATTERS. Harry goes to help her. They
text: stoop together, very close. The sexual attraction is almost
text: palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Shit!
text: They are very close to each other.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (reassuring)
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: No it isn't. You can't help me.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: I'm here, aren't I?
text: He kisses her. She kisses him back, hard.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nothing's going to happen to you.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (seductive)
dialog: Nothing?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Nothing you don't want.
text: They kiss again, passionately.
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Valentin breaks into the shadows, as Harry and Dorothea cross
text: the darkened lobby and head upstairs. Then Valentin crosses
text: to the phone and dials.
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: A room of illusions. Walls lined with mirrors, and warm,
text: flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and
text: Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor.
text: It is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Valentin opens the front door. There's a wind blowing. The
text: palms churn against the night sky...
speaker_heading: INTERCUT
text: Roiling, wind-filled pains with the glistening, urgent bodies
dialog: of Harry and Dorothea.
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Harry cradles Dorothea in post-coital languor.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I was so afraid.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Don't be. Nix can't hurt you now.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm sure.
dialog: (kisses her)
text: He's dead.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I know. I'm the one who shot
dialog: him.
text: ON HARRY. He's startled, to say the least.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I was twelve. Nix took me hostage,
dialog: to get Swann to come to him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: And they all came...
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Quaid and Jennifer--
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: And Pimm and Swann. Only Nix was
dialog: ready for them.
text: There's a NOISE downstairs.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's okay.
text: Harry slips out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - STAIRS - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which
text: is all he wears). He has his gun.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Valentin?
text: Dorothea appears behind him.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Harry? Wait!
text: Harry's at the bottom of the stairs now. Across the hall, in
text: a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE. We can make out no detail
dialog: of clothing or face.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What the hell-?
text: Suddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry. A BLAST of
text: ENERGY bursts against Harry's face. As it breaks against his
text: skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's
dialog: skull.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (in pain)
dialog: Aah!
text: Harry FIRES at the figure. The shadows fold up around the
text: Stranger like an origami puzzle. He's gone.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: It's him! It's Nix!
text: Harry goes out into the passageway.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Valentin! Get some lights on!
text: As if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE
text: erupts behind Harry. He swings round to see the Stranger
text: "unfolding" out of the shadows again, defying physics and
text: physiology to do so. The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent
text: writhing on the ground. It comes at Harry. Harry FIRES at
text: it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's
text: leg. He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a
text: door, and flings it open. He's in --
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT
text: The FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand.
text: Harry drops the GUN. Looks up to see the Stranger in the
text: doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on. But then,
text: he hesitates. Harry glances round, and sees that the
text: Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at
text: the CASKET.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Somebody you know?
text: Dorothea appears behind the Stranger. Sees Harry, burned and
text: sweating, cornered against the casket.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Oh my God!
text: The Stranger looks round. Harry snatches up the GUN,
text: supporting his burned hand with -his good hand. Levels the
text: gun at the Stranger. The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Which goes first? My face or
dialog: your heart?
text: The Stranger draws a deep breath. The Fire-Serpent withers
dialog: and dies.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Who in God's name are you?
text: She reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone
text: into darkness. The WIND blows through the house, masking his
dialog: exit.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Find Valentin! Find him! Get him
dialog: in here!
text: Dorothea disappears. Harry takes one of the candle-holders
text: and jams it under the casket lid. Wood splinters. He starts
text: to force off the lid.
text: Valentin and Dorothea enter.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What are you doing? This is
dialog: sacrilege.
text: He starts towards Harry. Dorothea goes after him and catches
text: hold of his arm. Her expression is a mingling of fascination
text: and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
dialog: pulls.
text: Inside, Swann's corpse.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Are you satisfied now?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No.
text: Harry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger
text: into the corpse's mouth.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: It's all right. It's not
dialog: hurting...
text: He now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of
text: his lower jaw. It cracks --
text: -- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ...plaster doesn't bleed.
text: He tosses the jaw to Valentin.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Dorothea)
dialog: It looks like you're not a widow
dialog: after all.

text: Harry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea
text: binds Harry's hand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You rigged the illusion to fail,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You paid off the doctor. You set
dialog: up the fake body. Yes?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And then... because I was
dialog: getting too close to something --
dialog: (at Dorothea)
dialog: --or someone, you called Swann
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I tried to pay you off.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Was that Swann's idea?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: No. It was mine. I didn't want
dialog: any more bloodshed. That's why we
dialog: went to all this trouble, so
dialog: there'd be no one for Nix to come
dialog: after.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nix is dead and buried, for
dialog: fuck's sake.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Haven't you seen enough to know
dialog: that doesn't matter?
text: ON HARRY. He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe
text: Nix's resurrection is plausible.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I want to see Swann face to face.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Why don't you leave this alone? Let
dialog: everybody think it's over?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: What about me?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Nix was never interested in you.
dialog: It was always Swann.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Dorothea)
dialog: Maybe Valentin's right. We should
dialog: let it alone.
text: A BELL starts to TOLL-
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (con't.)
dialog: He went to all that trouble to be
dialog: dead. Maybe we should let him stay
dialog: that way.
text: The TOLLING carries over into
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY
text: WE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by
text: MOURNERS. The graveside service has just ended, and the
text: Mourners are beginning to disperse. Dorothea is there
text: amongst them, of course. So are several faces we recognize:
dialog: Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his
text: Dancers, his Technicians. There are also several members of
text: the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom,
text: to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists.
text: Harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)
text: from the doorway of a mausoleum. His eyes are on Dorothea as
text: she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of
dialog: condolesence.
scene_heading: EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY
text: The standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They
text: are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces.
scene_heading: INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY
text: The stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium
text: in darkness. Swann's equipment - including the partially
text: dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage.
text: Valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann
text: "died." He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage.
scene_heading: EXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY
text: THE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee
text: down into the street.
speaker_heading: 1ST WORKER
dialog: Watch out!
text: On the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet.
dialog: We don't see who.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY
text: Harry catches sight of somebody close to the gates of the
text: cemetery. Dark glasses, a beard, an anonymous black suit.
text: Harry smiles slightly, and slips off between the mausoleums.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - PARKING LOT - DAY
text: The BLACK-COATED MOURNER gets into his car.
text: On Harry, as he gets into his.
scene_heading: INT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY
text: Valentin hears something in the auditorium. Looks up.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Who's there?
text: He reaches into his jacket to draw a GUN. There's a NOISE.
text: He swings round. Too late.
text: Butterfield has a scalpel at his throat. He kicks Valentin
text: to the ground.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: (conversationally)
dialog: I've sometimes thought, if I'd had
dialog: another profession, I would have
dialog: been a surgeon.
text: On Valentin, staring up in terror.
text: Valentin's P.O.V.- of Butterfield, upside down, above him,
text: the scalpel glittering.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: To be able to heal with one little
dialog: cut.
text: On Valentin again, as Butterfield's blade touches his cheek,
text: just beneath his eye.
speaker_heading: VALEMTIN
dialog: No. . .
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Let's say those eyes of yours were
dialog: giving you trouble.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: I could scoop them out.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: So tell me where Nix is buried.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I don't know.
text: Butterfield pushes the blade into Valentin's skin.
text: CUT WIDE, as Valentin thrashes, his face obscured by
text: Butterfield's body.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Wait!
text: On Valentin again. There is a small cut beneath his eye, but
dialog: that's all.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'll tell you.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: You'll do more.than that.
scene_heading: EXT. L.A. STREET - SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY
text: A bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets.
text: Harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with
text: barbed wire. He peers through the bars.
text: Harry's P.O.V. of the STRANGER from the funeral disappearing
text: into the building. He glances back towards the street. We
text: get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat.
text: Harry slides out of sight. Waits until the Stranger has gone
text: inside. Then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed
dialog: wire.
scene_heading: INT. -SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - DAY
text: It's been a hospital. Now the echoing corridors and wards
text: are deserted, littered with reminders of old suffering.
text: Rotting mattresses; spilled boxes of surgical supplies.
text: Harry explores this tiled labyrinth, looking for some sign of
dialog: the Stranger.
text: He enters a shadowy room. Birds fly UP into his face!
text: As he retreats, another SOUND, a little distance from him.
text: GUN in hand, he heads towards it, and steps into
scene_heading: INT. SEMI-DERELICT BUILDING - OPERATING THEATRE - DAY
text: Narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window
text: fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded
text: equipment. Eerie. Disturbing.
text: Harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay
dialog: away.
text: Silence. Harry notices the beard and glasses on the
dialog: operating table.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You had to see who wept for you the
dialog: most.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A lot of people are going to be
dialog: really pissed off when they
dialog: discover you're still alive.
speaker_heading: SWANN (V.O.)
dialog: They'll never find out.
text: Harry looks up.
text: Svanrt is hovering in the air above him. The veins in his
text: temples bulge and throb. This trick requires a lot of
dialog: concentration.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Look, Ma, no wires.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: You shouldn't have followed me,
dialog: D'Amour.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How the fuck do you do that?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Now I'm going to have to kill you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don't think so. You need me
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Why? So you can fuck my wife?
text: Swann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Be careful. Funerals make me
dialog: trigger-happy.
text: Swann stops, inches from the ground.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know, it's such a fucking
dialog: waste. You can do shit most of us
dialog: can only dream about, and you go
dialog: around pretending it's some trick.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Illusionists get. Las Vegas
dialog: contracts, D'Amour. Magicians get
dialog: burned.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Or murdered, like Nix.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: He deserved it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Maybe he doesn't see it that way.
dialog: Maybe he's digging his
dialog: way out of the hole you put him
dialog: right now. That's what you're
dialog: hiding away from, isn't it?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: I did it for Dorothea.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's
dialog: off her.
text: Harry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now
text: they're face to face. Eye to eye. Swann, for all his
text: posturing, is afraid.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: So Nix won't come looking for her?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: It's me betrayed him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And she shot him I I think that'd
dialog: piss me off if I were Nix.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: (despairing)
dialog: I don't know what else to do.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Help me.
text: On Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Listen. If he's back from the
text: dead, then he is some kind of god.
dialog: And he'll find you, wherever the
dialog: fuck you are.
dialog: And if he's just another phony
dialog: Messiah, then you can stage the
dialog: greatest come-back in history.
dialog: ON Swann. This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.
scene_heading: EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles
text: are already gathered. The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out.
text: SNAKES seethe out of the open car door.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON
text: We MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of
text: several CULTISTS as we go. They all have looks of barely
text: suppressed ecstasy on their faces.
text: We are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker.
text: A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life. We
text: see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix,
text: floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction.
text: Norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath,
text: Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever. Norman
dialog: grins.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A small, garishly-lit liquor store. Harry's car pulls into
text: the lot. Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into
text: the store. Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him.
scene_heading: INT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Swann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap
dialog: brandy.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Is this the best brandy you've
dialog: got?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: If that's what's on the shelves.
text: Swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Can you change a thousand for me?
speaker_heading: CASHIER
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: You're shittin' me.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Can we go?
text: Swann starts to COUGH. A QUARTER falls from his mouth.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh Jeez.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Will that do? No?
text: Swann coughs again. Puts his hand to his mouth. A DELUGE of
text: QUARTERS runs between his fingers.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: That better?
text: The Cashier gapes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - GROUNDS - DUSK
text: The house could not look more reassuringly calm. A SWAN
text: struts beside the pool. A long, HUSHED MOMENT...
scene_heading: SHOCK CUT TO:
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA'S DREAM
text: A BABOON SHRIEKS, its mouth filling the frame.
text: CUT WIDE, to reveal the Baboon, racing around Nix's Sanctum,
text: crazed.
text: Hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a
text: shadowy figure. Is it Nix? We can't quite see. Black BLOOD
text: runs from the figure and splashes on the ground.
text: NOW WE SEE DOROTHEA, being pulled by the Cultists towards the
text: falling gouts of dark fluid --
dialog: -- she struggles, SOBBING --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: She tosses around on the bed
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA'S DREAM
text: -- Dorothea has a GUN in her hand. The Cultists shake it
text: from her grip, and pull her directly under the BLOOD -- as it
text: SPLASHES on her upturned face --
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: A SOUND. Dorothea wakes, distressed by the dream. She gets
text: up and goes out onto --
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - LANDING - DUSK
text: Looks down the stairs.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Who's there?
text: Silence. Then, Valentin speaks behind her. She jumps.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: BLOOD runs from his cut face.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Jesus. Valentin. What did you do
dialog: to your face?
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD (V.O.)
dialog: It was me.
text: She turns. He's on her in a heartbeat, pressing her back
text: against the wail.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Guess who we're going to see?
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S CAR - DUSK
text: Harry drives. Swann takes a throatful of brandy. Then he
text: stares at Harry.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: You think I'm an asshole.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Didn't know you read minds.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: (a warning)
dialog: I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour.
dialog: But you know that.
dialog: (an apology)
dialog: So I like playing games with
dialog: people. Gives them something to
dialog: wonder about...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Is that all?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: I distract them from their banality
text: for a few minutes. It's like a
dialog: public service. It doesn't mean
dialog: much in the end. They're all going
dialog: to die.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And you're not?
text: Silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Oh, I was going to discover the
dialog: secret of the universe. That's why
dialog: I liked Nix. He promised me all
dialog: these explanations.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And he didn't have them?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: He had something. He showed me how
dialog: to bend the rules. A little
text: levitation. A few fireworks.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Is that all?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: No.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: At the end... when we had him
dialog: cornered, he got into my head. He
dialog: showed me what we really look like,
text: when the veneer's gone. Jelly.
dialog: Shit...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And you believed him?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: I saw it with my own fucking eyes!
dialog: See, that's his best trick. No
dialog: illusions. Just the truth.
dialog: (he looks at Harry)
dialog: Are you ready for that?
text: Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Hey!
text: Harry drinks.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Thought not.
scene_heading: EXT. SWANN'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: PAN DOWN from the palms to Harry's car, outside the front
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT
text: Harry puts his head in the study, the library, the bedroom.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Dorothea?
text: Now he's on the landing. Swann's below.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: She's not here.
text: Harry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Did she know where Nix was buried?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who else did? Did Valentin?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Jesus!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Butterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of
dialog: stars.
scene_heading: INT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT
text: Valentin drives. Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back.
text: Dorothea is handcuffed.
text: He has a bag open at his feet. One by one he takes out a
text: series of extraordinary instruments. Dorothea looks on,
text: confounded.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Like the look of these? I made
dialog: them myself, to set him free.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Why did you wait so long?
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: I didn't have the skill to
dialog: resurrect him. I had to teach
dialog: myself. And that took time.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: And you think he'll be in a fit
dialog: state to resurrect, after thirteen
dialog: years?
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: If he was just a man like me, then
dialog: no. But he's not.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: What is he?
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Maybe he'll show you.
text: ON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house.
text: Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES.
text: There is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house.
text: It has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity.
text: We DRIFT towards the front door.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Now we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room.
text: Inside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle. They are all
text: CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that
text: blazes in the centre of the circle. They hack
text: indiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their
text: eyes wild. BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked
text: ears and scalps.
text: And still the CHANT BUILDS, and BUILDS...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: He will come! He will come! He
dialog: will come!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT
text: Wide. A few rocks, and emptiness.
text: The headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness,
text: illuminating the dig. Valentin is in the grave, digging.
text: ON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole,
text: watching the work. Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN (V.0.)
dialog: Not yet.
text: Butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly
text: reaches out for Valentin, hauling him close.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: If you've lied to me to me --
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I swear... this is the place Swann
dialog: told me about. The rocks...
text: On Dorothea, who uses Butterfield's distraction to take a few
text: steps back towards the open car door.
text: Dorothea's P.O.V. of Butterfield, back to her, interrogating
text: Valentin.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Five more minutes. Hear me? And
dialog: you'd better not --
text: A SOUND behind him. Butterfield wheels round. On the ground
text: beside the open car door, the instruments.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: What the fuck are you playing at?
text: He goes to pick them up. Dorothea steps from behind the
text: door, with the sharpest in her hand. She slashes at him.
text: Opens a WOUND across his arm.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Aah!
text: He comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her
text: hand, and slamming her against the car. He hits her. Once.
dialog: Twice. Then --
speaker_heading: VALENTIN (V.O.)
dialog: Butterfield!
text: Butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the
text: flashlight and trains the beam on Valentin.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: (blinded)
text: In the corner...
text: The beam goes to the corner of the grave.
text: A mummified HAND is sticking out of one of the walls.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: (to Valentin)
dialog: Keep away from it.
text: Butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand.
text: The TRACK is silent, but for Butterfield's shallow breath.
text: He reaches out to touch Nix^s fingers...
dialog: Closer...
dialog: Closer...
text: He touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
speaker_heading: ROAR!
text: He jumps back as Nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the
text: mask rolls into view.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Oh Christ! Oh Christ!
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: (reverentially)
dialog: It's him... it's him.
text: On Dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT
text: The car is static; the engine still running.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: They got here before us.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Looks that way.
scene_heading: EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT
text: Harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave.
scene_heading: HARRY'S MOVING P.O.V. OF THE GRAVE
text: Harry reaches the grave's-edge. It's totally dark. He peers
text: in. On his heel, as the ground CRUMBLES beneath his weight.
text: Harry slides into the grave.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shit!
text: He's in darkness now. He gets to his feet, and starts to try
text: and scramble out.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Swann? Swann!
dialog: Silence.
text: Suddenly, a hand is laid on his shoulder! Harry swings
text: round. It's Valentin. He has been badly cut up.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: D'Amour --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shit...
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Help me.
text: He collapses into Harry's arms.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Swann!
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Indecision is written all over Swann's face: to help or not
dialog: to help?
speaker_heading: HARRY (V.O.)
dialog: Swann!
text: He decides. Gets out.
scene_heading: EXT. NIX'S GRAVE - MIGHT
text: Swann goes to the graveside, terrified.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Give me a hand. I got Valentin.
text: Together, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and
text: lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.
speaker_heading: VALENTIM
dialog: He's got Dorothea.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: And Nix?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Him too.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We've got to get you to a hospital.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Don't bother.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shut up. We've lost enough lives
dialog: already.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I'm sorry, D'Amour...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: ... Looks like you're going...
dialog: to lose... one more.
text: Valentin dies.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (despairing)
dialog: ... no...
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: He's better off this way.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Nobody's better off this wav!
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: You don't get it, do you? We're
dialog: shit. D'Amour.
text: He puts his foot beneath Valentin's body. It rolls back into
text: Nix's grave.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: That's where we're all going.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: In my time, and nobody else's.
text: ON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann
text: getting into the car. The doors SLAM. The CAR LIGHTS
text: retreat. The grave is left to DARKNESS.
scene_heading: EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The house is silent now.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT
text: We TRACK through the house. The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of
text: them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum.
text: ON THE SANCTUM DOOR. Butterfield emerges. He is wearing
text: WHITE now.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Do you wish him to be amongst us?
speaker_heading: CULTISTS
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Will you come to him on your
dialog: knees?
speaker_heading: CULTISTS
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Be ready.
text: Now we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands.
text: With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the
text: bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up
text: MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor
text: sharp pieces of GLASS.
text: ON Butterfield, smiling. He steps back into the Sanctum.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
text: HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the
text: BODY of Nix. It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL.
text: Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs. Beside its
text: head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out.
text: ON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as
text: she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed
text: into Nix's face. He works with surgical precision.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Listen. You've got everything you
dialog: want. You don't need me. ..
text: A piece of the mask comes away from the cheek. A subtle
text: POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely.
text: We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on
text: occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these
text: signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: No, but he will. After what you
dialog: did to him.
text: He pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: He'll want vengeance. Simple PS
dialog: that.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT
text: The bottle-breaking has ceased. The Cultists stand,
text: breathless with anticipation.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
text: On Nix's emaciated mouth. The lips TWITCH.
text: On Dorothea. The DUST moves around her.
text: And Nix DRAWS BREATH.
text: On Butterfield, TEARS in his eyes.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Oh my Lord. He's coming home...
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
text: The whisper runs through the congregation:
speaker_heading: CULTISTS
dialog: He's coming home... he/s coming
dialog: home...
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
text: ON Dorothea, eyes wide.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Christ in Heaven.
text: ON Nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils.
text: His withered flesh starts to REHYDRATE; his veins start to
speaker_heading: THROB.
text: Butterfield is watching the process in amazement. Nix's HANDS
text: move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is
text: still screwed over his eyes.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: He's with us...
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

text: Unnoticed by Butterfield, who has his eyes on Nix, Dorothea
text: gets to her feet and creeps away to the door. Very quiet
speaker_heading: TRACK.
text: Suddenly, the snake-handling Cultist steps into view, snakes
text: coiled around his face and fingers!
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Oh God!
text: Butterfield looks up.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Hold her!
text: On Nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face. It
text: comes away with a moist, WRENCHING SOUND. At last, we see
text: his eyes.
speaker_heading: NIX'S P.O.V.
text: The candle-lights blaze, BLINDING his sensitive eyes.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (fury to agony)
dialog: Aaarrrgh!
text: He gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over
text: all the lights but two. Then he strikes Butterfield to the
text: ground, and slams his foot on Butterfield's neck, knocking
text: him unconscious. It's a terrifying, almost demoniacal
text: display of instant physical superiority. Throughout, he
text: literally ROARS in rage.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
text: The Cultists SCREAM in sympathy, letting out years of
text: repressed frustration. Many of them are dancing on the
text: shards of glass now, crazed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT NEAR NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Harry's car is parked a quarter mile from Nix's house. He is
text: getting out. Swann stays put.
text: The SOUND of SCREAMING is carried towards them on the wind.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (spooked)
dialog: Jesus... what the hell's going on
dialog: in there?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: At a guess... they just resurrected
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Fuck.
text: Harry starts towards the house. After a beat, Swann gets out
text: of the car and follows.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT
text: On Butterfield, as Nix removes his foot. Butterfield is out
dialog: for the count.
text: On Nix, as he stops screaming. His face is grotesquely
text: disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted.
text: The SCREAMING of the Cultists is dying away.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Children...
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
text: The Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Will you suffer to come unto me?
text: One by one, the Cultists fall to their knees. We never see
text: flesh pierced by broken glass. But we HEAR IT, and see the
text: agony on the Cultist's faces. They start to sob.
text: Then, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: I've come back to share the wisdom
dialog: of the grave. Will you hear it?
speaker_heading: CULTISTS
dialog: Yes... yes...
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Follow me then.
text: He steps out of the doorway. The Cultists let out sobs of
text: adoration. Nix locks at Dorothea.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Do I know you, child?
text: He reaches for her. Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea
text: keeps her self-possession; but only just.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Oh yes... I do, don't I? No gun
dialog: this time, child?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Where's Swann?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I don't know where he is.
text: Nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: He'll come. We've got unfinished
dialog: business, he and I.
text: Then he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation
text: Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the
text: wounds he's receiving.
text: The Cultists follow.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Nix strides into the middle of the room.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (whispered to Dorothea)
dialog: Something terrible's going to
dialog: happen. But if you hold on to me,
dialog: very tight, you may live a little
dialog: longer.
text: The Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (to Cultists)
dialog: Are you ready for my wisdom?
speaker_heading: CULTISTS
dialog: Tell us... tell us...
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
text: Harry pushes open the window, and climbs in. Swann follows.
text: He is frozen by the memory of what happened here.
text: ON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that
text: terrible event. Nix's SCREAMS. The GUN-SHOTS. The sound of
text: the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: (in terrified awe)
dialog: This is where we killed him.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (looking at table)
dialog: You didn't try hard enough.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: I can't... I can't go any
dialog: further...
text: Harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked
text: grip. He crosses to the door.
text: Suddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and
text: catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground.
text: He has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand. He STABS at
text: Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Here is my wisdom.
text: He stamps on the ground. CRACKS spread from his foot in all
text: directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of
dialog: power.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: Show us. Puritan.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Yes, show us!
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Show us! Show us!
text: With a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath
text: Nix and Dorothea. Nix HOVERS over it. It's utterly dark;
text: perhaps bottomless.
dialog: Dorothea SCREAMS!
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT
text: Hearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the
text: passageway. Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the
text: ground and stabs at Harry a second time. But Swann catches
text: hold of his arm.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: Whatever he's doing to her, stop
dialog: him!
dialog: And Harry's up and away --
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
text: -- he dashes over the glass --
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: On Nix, Dorothea clasped close to him. He REVOLVES as he
text: floats over the chasm below then.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (to unseen Cultists)
dialog: You see, I escaped the grave. So I
dialog: have to give something to the grave
dialog: in return.
text: On the Cultists, listening to their lord with love in their
dialog: eyes.
text: A SLIT OPENS in the middle of Nix's forehead, above the
text: bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
text: the library), and from it comes a WAVE OF DARKNESS. As Nix
text: REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the
dialog: Cultists.
text: At first they don't realize what's going on. They think this
dialog: is some kind of bizarre blessing.
text: Then the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What's happening?
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: I have to give something back. So
dialog: I'm giving you.
text: They're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground.
text: They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry
text: for them. They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: Why? Why?
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: You're not worthy. None of you.
dialog: Only Swann was worthy. You just
text: waited like lambs.
text: Harry appears in the doorway. Nix, still swinging round, has
text: his back to Harry.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Well I'm not your shepherd.
text: Harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him. The ground
text: is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have
text: disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up
text: out of the dirt. The scene has a surreal beauty to it
text: despite its horror. SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid
text: ground. TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix
text: and Dorothea, GUN levelled. So far, he has avoided Nix's
dialog: gaze.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT
text: Butterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle.
text: They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was
text: resurrected. It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann
text: is stunned. Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
text: and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of
dialog: time.
text: The BLADE catches him in the arm, however.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Aah!
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Go on, bleed.
text: (he slashes at Swann
dialog: again)
dialog: Go on! Go on!
text: Butterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a
text: wall. He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across
text: the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face!
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: No!
text: He falls backwards, his face ON FIRE. Swann doesn't wait to
text: watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD
text: running from his wound.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Harry is staring up at Dorothea as he very gingerly crosses
text: the still-sticky ground. He's a yard from the edge of the
dialog: pit now.
text: Nix swings round.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: You're not Swann. Who are you?
dialog: (a beat) )
dialog: Oh... I know what you want. He lets
text: Dorothea slip from his arms.
text: Harry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of
text: Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss. His GUN
text: goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door
text: leading to the passageway.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Oh God!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hang on!
text: Nix reaches down to torment Harry. But before he can make
dialog: contact
speaker_heading: SWANN (V.O.)
dialog: Nix!
text: Nix looks up.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: There you are.
text: Suddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He
text: steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone
text: suddenly conversational.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: I've had a lot of time to think
dialog: about you. Where I went wrong...
text: With Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the
dialog: chasm.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: I should have been honest with you,
dialog: right from the start. I wasn't
dialog: born to show people the error of
dialog: their ways. I was born to murder
dialog: the world.
text: ON HARRY, as he leads Dorothea to the door. Harry glances
text: back into the room.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: You could still help me do that.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Why would I want to?
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Because you've got nothing else to
dialog: live for.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Not true.
speaker_heading: NIX
text: The woman has a new love in her
dialog: life. Your friends are dead.
dialog: Nobody's left to save you, but me
text: He lays his hands on Swann. Draws him into an embrace.
text: ON HARRY and Dorothea.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Dorothea)
dialog: I've got to help him.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: You can't.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nix has got to have a weak spot.
dialog: Everybody's got a fucking weak
dialog: spot.
text: A NOISE. He turns, and suddenly --
text: Butterfield is there! His face is horribly burned, but he's
text: still very much alive.
speaker_heading: BUTTERFIELD
dialog: Bastard!
text: He launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the
text: BROKEN GLASS. A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the
dialog: Passageway.
text: Nix has Swann in a bear-hug.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Will you help me?
text: A beat. Then Swann nods.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Yes.
text: Nix lets him go.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: You know I'll kill you when we're
dialog: done. I have to.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: But until then... it's you and
dialog: me... the way it always was.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Yes.
text: Dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.
text: Swann's eyes flicker towards her. Nix turns.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Wait... you still feel something
dialog: for that bitch?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Liar!
text: Nix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall,
text: pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Will! You! Never! Learn!?
text: With each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in
text: Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,
text: they have the force of terrible blows. One to the ribs.
text: They CRACK. One to the face. It BLEEDS. One to the legs,
text: one to the arms. They all BREAK. Then Nix turns towards
dialog: Dorothea.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy.
dialog: I'll show you!
text: He moves towards Dorothea. Swann falls to the ground,
dialog: broken.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Harry!
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
text: The fight between Butterfield and Harry continues.
speaker_heading: SWANN (V.O.)
dialog: Harry! Stop him!
text: Harry looks up. Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and
text: running off into the darkness.
text: Butterfield comes at Harry again. Harry's got no more time
text: for this creep. He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe,
text: and Butterfield lands face down in the glass. We don't see
dialog: the impact. HEARING it's enough.
text: Harry looks down at the body. Then --
speaker_heading: NIX (V.O.)
dialog: Where is she?
text: Harry turns.
text: Nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's
text: body as he comes at Harry!
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Where did she go?
text: Nix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the
text: fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He
text: struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful.
text: Nix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's
text: temples. As before, there's no blood.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: You've got Swann's disease. You
dialog: think a little courage, a little
dialog: love, and it'll all be all right.
dialog: Wrong!
dialog: His fingers slide all the way in!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh God!
text: Harry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes
text: are BLOOD-RED. Nix is a few yards behind him.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Tell me where she is... and I'll
dialog: make it go away...
text: Harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.
speaker_heading: HARRY'S P.O.V.
text: The apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move! A face
text: SCREAMS! FIRE blossoms!
text: ON HARRY, verging on insanity.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh God... oh God...
speaker_heading: HARRY'S P.O.V.
text: Harry sees a WOMAN, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of
text: some glistening, barely visible OBSCENITY. We can't see her
text: face. Only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
dialog: devourer.
speaker_heading: ON HARRY
text: as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted.
text: Reaching out for the image.
speaker_heading: HARRY'S P.O.V.
text: The Woman reaches for Harry.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Help me.
speaker_heading: ON HARRY
text: as he touches the wall.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Dorothea!
text: He starts to SCRATCH out the plaster on which the image is
dialog: painted.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Dorothea! Dorothea!
speaker_heading: HARRY'S P.O.V.
text: Darkness swallows the image of the woman. She is still
text: screaming when she disappears.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: ON SWANN, dragging his broken body to the door.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ON HARRY
text: literally beating his head against the wall!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No! No! No!
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA (V.O.)
dialog: Harry...
text: Harry stops. Dare he believe this is truly her voice?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: It's not real, Harry-
text: Harry turns around. Dorothea is there.
speaker_heading: HARRY'S P.O.V.
text: For a moment, he sees Dorothea as she is.
text: ON HARRY, relief flooding his face. Then --
speaker_heading: HARRY'S P.O.V.
text: -- the image MORPHS. Dorothea's beauty is replaced by
text: primeval muck.
text: ON HARRY, appalled. Dorothea grabs hold of him.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Harry. Listen to me. Whatever's
dialog: good between us, believe it.
text: Harry's face is deathly white, and pouring SWEAT. He's
text: fighting the delirium. Or doing his best.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ... oh... God...
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: I'm here, Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ...yes?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Yes.
text: Nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind Harry.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (to Dorothea)
dialog: There you are, child.
text: Harry starts to look round.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Don't look.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I... have... to.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: Come on, child. I want Swann to
dialog: see you die.
text: Harry turns and looks at Nix.
speaker_heading: HARRY'S P.O.V.
text: Nix's face darkens as it MORPHS. And the flesh in the middle
text: of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: (to Harry)
dialog: What are you looking at?
text: ON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room
text: and now slips inside.
text: ON HARRY, staring up at Nix.
text: ON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room. In her
text: hand, Harry's GUN. Harry looks round at her.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (points to his brow)
dialog: There... there!
text: ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea.
text: ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN. She FIRES.
text: The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD. He sinks to his knees,
text: BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE
dialog: used to be.
text: ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters. He leans against the
text: wall, shaking.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm okay. I'm okay.
text: Harry opens his eyes. Looks up at her.
speaker_heading: HARRY'S P.O.V.
text: The last of the MORPHING fades. He sees Dorothea as she
text: actually is. Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they
dialog: embrace.
text: Suddenly, a ROAR from Nix. They look towards him --
dialog: -- it isn't over.
text: One last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he
text: kneels in the GLASS. His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS
text: up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his
dialog: forehead --
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: One... last... illusion...
text: -- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of
text: the bullet wound.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Oh my God.
text: Harry and Dorothea start to get up...
text: Nix is no longer human. He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS,
text: stripped of features. He opens his mouth, the only visible
text: element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an
dialog: utterly inhuman SHRIEK!
speaker_heading: SWANN (V.O.)
dialog: ... D'Amour...
text: Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room.
text: Swann is on the threshold.
text: Nix RISES now. He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk
text: somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form.
text: He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into
dialog: the Meditation Room.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: The pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is
text: backed towards it by Nix.
text: When Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human. It is
scene_heading: DEMONIACAL.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: I am the purest of the pure. I am
dialog: the darkest of the dark...
text: Harry is at the door now, starting towards Nix.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Harry. You can't kill him.
text: Harry crouches beside Swann.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (whispers)
text: He did something with the ground.
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Can you do it?
speaker_heading: SWANN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Try.
text: ON DOROTHEA. She's a couple of yards from the pit now.
speaker_heading: NIX (V.O.)
dialog: I'm beyond Heaven. I'm beyond
dialog: Hell.
text: Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs.
text: Nix topples.
text: ON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground. Closes his eyes.
text: A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's
dialog: broken fingers --
text: -- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like
text: corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces
dialog: resurfacing --
text: Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over
text: the edge of the pit.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (to Dorothea)
dialog: Get out of here!
text: The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging
text: around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit. So's
dialog: Harry, of course.
text: Nix tries to get up, but he's too late. The corpses weigh
text: him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper
text: hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.
speaker_heading: NIX
dialog: No! No! No!
text: He's at the edge of the pit.
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA (V.O.)
dialog: Harry!
text: Harry looks round. Dorothea's behind him, risking the
text: flowing ground to offer him a hand.
text: Nix starts to fall into the pit. At the last minute, he
dialog: reaches for Harry, as --
text: -- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea.
text: Together they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies.
text: They look back to see
text: NIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING.
text: At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head. He's dead. She
text: closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT
dialog: What we are about to witness is the longest fall-to-his-
dialog: death by any villain in the history of cinema...
text: Nix is falling through rock. Still SCREAMING. He CRASHES
text: against a layer of stone, which his body smashes to
text: smithereens. And as he falls --
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Is it finished?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I think so.
text: No it's not. Nix keeps falling, breaking through another
text: layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the
dialog: earth.
text: And now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below. He's
text: approaching MAGMA.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Come on...
text: She puts her arms around him. Kisses him, sobbing with
dialog: relief.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT
text: Nix hits a layer of molten rock, and, SCREAMING, he
text: disappears. A BURST of dark, roiling ENERGY erupts from the
text: spot where he sank, and starts up the pit --
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: The room TREMBLES. There's a ROAR in the earth.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What the fuck?
speaker_heading: DOROTHEA
dialog: Harry-?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Out! Out!
text: They race for the front door --
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT

dialog: a breath-taking rate
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DESERT - DAWN
text: Harry and Dorothea stumble to the car. They look back at the

scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - DAWN
text: The SUNLIGHT creeps through the rooms as the DUST settles.
scene_heading: INT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAWN
