speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. DAISY'S BEDROOM - DAY / AUGUST 1948
text: A precise, orderly room. Comfortable and well maintained, but
text: not. fancy or trendy. Venetian blinds are drawn against the
text: hot August sun. The room seems to be in repose. Suddenly the
text: face of DAISY WERTHAN appears, looking directly at us. She
text: straightens the straw hat on her head. We realize we have
text: been looking at a mirror image of the room.
text: Daisy is seventy-two years old and apparently in excellent
text: health. She wears a summer street dress, low-heeled white
dialog: shoes and appropriate summer jewelry -- no makeup.
text: She does not dwell on her mirror image, once the hat is
text: adjusted. She reaches into a bureau drawer, takes out a pair
text: of white gloves, gets her pocket book from the closet and
text: walks purposefully out of the room.
text: A SERIES OF SHOTS
text: A. Daisy in the upstairs hall.
text: B. Daisy walking down the carpeted steps.
text: c. Daisy in the downstairs hall, which contains a commode
text: with a 1930's telephone on it and various objets d'art.
text: D. Daisy in the dining room, drapes closed against the hot
dialog: sunlight.
text: E. Daisy through the swinging door in the pantry.
text: She moves briskly through the silent rooms. This is a woman
text: who is never idle. Everything about her suggests energy and
text: purpose. What we see of her house tells us that she is in
text: comfortable circumstances. Bookshelves are evident in many of
text: the rooms. The furniture is overstuffed and/or mahogany.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN - DAY
text: A spacious, black-and-white tiled kitchen -- pre-W.W.I in
text: dimension. The only sign of the times is a fairly modern gas
dialog: range. ‘
text: IDELLA, black and close to Daisy's age, stands at the sink,
text: under the window, polishing silver with an old toothbrush.
text: She does not look up, or in any way acknowledge Daisy's
text: entrance into the kitchen.
text: Daisy removes a shopping list from a cabinet drawer.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I'm gone to the market, Idelia.
speaker_heading: IDELLA
dialog: Mmmmmm .
text: Daisy heads out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BACK YARD - DAY
text: Bright hot sunlight, the yard shimmering in the morning heat.
text: We can SEE the outside of the house now -- Georgian, built in
text: the teens, comfortable, but not pretentious. Green canvas
text: awnings protect the house from the sun.
text: DAISY walks to the garage, a separate building, built for two
text: cars, but only holding one -- a shiny new 1948 Packard. She
text: climbs into the car.
text: A SERIES OF SHOTS
text: A. Daisy's gloved hand turns on the ignition.
text: B. Her POV. Shifting the automatic gear into reverse.
text: Cc. Her high-heeled foot pushing the accelerator.
text: D. On the car, backing out of the garage and into the
dialog: turnaround.
text: E. On Daisy, gloved hands both clutching the wheel, back
text: straight, not touching the seat.
text: F. On the gear indicator, still in reverse.
text: G. On Daisy's foot, gunning the accelerator.
text: I. On the car, shooting backwards over an embankment,
text: seemingly suspended in the air for a moment before it lands on
text: the roof of the garage next door (down the hill) causing the
text: garage to collapse, which, in turn, lands on the free-standing
text: toolshed just adjacent to it, which also falls into pieces,
text: seattering garden tools, etc., in all directions. The NOISE
text: is deafening.
text: J. On Idella, looking out of the kitchen window in horror.
speaker_heading: IDELLA
dialog: Sweet Jesus!
text: H. On a nursemaid and a toddler, coming out of the house next
dialog: door.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GARAGE - SAME TIME
text: Daisy's severely damaged car sits in (on) what's left of the
text: garage. All is still.
speaker_heading: ON DAISY
text: Still in the car, still clutching the wheel with gloved hands.
text: Her hat is crooked and her glasses are askew, but otherwise
text: she is unhurt. She tests the door handle. It works. She
text: pushes the door open, extracts her purse from the car and gets
dialog: out.
scene_heading: EXT. THE NEIGHBOR'S GARAGE - DAY
text: What's left of Daisy's car rises in the air, ghost-like.
text: PULL BACK reveals that the car is being hoisted by a tow truck
text: and a gigantic chain and pulley operation. What's left of the
text: garage collapses like pick-up sticks.
text: BOOLIE WERTHAN, Daisy's son, age 40, stands with a policeman
text: and insurance agent in the yard. He wears a good summer
text: business suit. A sizable part of the neighborhood, black
text: servants, children, yard men, etc., stand silently at a
text: respectful distance watching the proceedings.
speaker_heading: ON BOOLIE
text: He looks up the hill towards his mother's house.
scene_heading: BOOLIE'S POV - DAISY'S HOUSE
text: Daisy is watching from her bedroom window, but moves quickly
text: out of the way when Boolie catches her eyes.
text: ON THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD AGAIN
text: The pulley operation sets the remains of the car at rest. The
text: reverberations of this knock down what's left of the toolshed.
text: ON THE CROWD, watching silently.
scene_heading: INT. DAISY'S KITCHEN ~ SAME DAY
text: Idella is sitting on a stool, eating fried chicken and potato
text: salad at the kitchen counter. Boolie is seated at the kitchen
text: table, finishing off a plate of same. Each has a glass of ice
text: tea and a paper napkin, but Idella's plate is a cracked
text: remnant of an old pattern, her fork is from the dime store,
text: and her tea is in a small mason jar. Boolie is eating off of
text: Daisy's everyday china and silver. Daisy is not in the room,
text: but a THUMPING and CLUMPING 0.S. indicate that she is within
dialog: earshot. .
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Mama!
speaker_heading: DAISY (0.S.)
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Mama!
speaker_heading: DAISY (0.S.)
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: It's a miracle you're not laying
dialog: in Emory Hospital -- or decked out
text: at the funeral parlor.
text: He rises from the table, and heads for
speaker_heading: TRE PANTRY
text: Daisy is in the pantry closet, having changed out of her
text: street clothes into a house dress. She is kneeling on the
text: floor by a large pickle crock, removing the lid, the rock that
text: holds down a plate, which, in turn, holds down the pickles in
text: their brine. She maneuvers the crock out of the closet and
text: toward the pantry sink, waving away Boolie's efforts to help
dialog: her.
text: Once at the sink, she begins the operation of spearing pickles
text: that are already lined up by the sink and then ladling brine
text: into the jars and screwing on the jar tops. This operation
text: keeps her busy during the following scene. She spears the
text: first pickle out of the crock and hands it to Boolie, who
text: takes a bite.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: The cucumbers are pretty this
dialog: summer.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Look at you! You didn't even
dialog: break your glasses.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: It was the car's fault.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Mama, you had the car in the
dialog: wrong gear.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I did not.
dialog: (calls to Idella)
dialog: Idella! You want a pickle with
dialog: your lunch?
speaker_heading: IDELLA (0.S.)
dialog: Not me.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Well, I'm putting up a jar for you
dialog: to take home to William, you hear?
speaker_heading: IDELLA (0.S.)
dialog: Yassum. Thank you. He love your
text: pickles.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: That's because he has more sense
dialog: than you do.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: You had the car in reverse instead
text: of drive. The police report shows
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You should have let me keep my
dialog: LaSalle. It never ‘would have
dialog: behaved this way.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Mama, cars don't behave. They are
dialog: behaved upon. The fact is you,
dialog: all by yourself, demolished that
dialog: Packard.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Think what you want. I know the
dialog: truth.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: The truth is you just cost the
dialog: insurance company twenty-seven
dialog: hundred dollars. You are a
dialog: terrible risk. Nobody is going
dialog: to issue you a policy after this.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You're just saying that to be
dialog: hateful.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Okay. Yes. Yes I am. I'm making
dialog: it all up. Every insurance company
dialog: in America is lined up out there in
text: the driveway, waving their fountain
text: pens and falling all over themselves
dialog: to get you to sign on.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I love having you here for lunch,
dialog: son, but if you're going to stand
dialog: in my pantry and lie like a rug,
dialog: well, I think it's time for you
dialog: to go somewhere else.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Okay. I'd better get back to the
dialog: office. Florine'll be having a fit
dialog: if I don't come home on time tonight.
speaker_heading: DAISY .
dialog: That's right. I forgot. Y'all are
dialog: having dinner with the Ansleys
dialog: tonight! I'm sure Florine bought
dialog: another new dress. This is her
dialog: idea of heaven on earth, isn't it?
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: What? .
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Socializing with Episcopalians.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE .
dialog: You're a doodle, Mama. I'11 stop
dialog: by tomorrow evening.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: How do you know I'll be here?
dialog: I'm certainly not dependent on
dialog: you for company.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Fine. I'll call first. But you
dialog: know that we have got some real
dialog: serious talking to do.
speaker_heading: : DAISY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Mama}!
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (singing to end
dialog: discussion)
text: After the ball is over
dialog: After the break of morn
text: After the dancers leaving
text: After the stars are gone
dialog: Many a heart is aching
dialog: If you could read them all --
text: As soon as she starts singing, Daisy, having finished her
text: pickle business, turns on her heels and walks out of the
text: pantry. We HEAR her SINGING continue and FADE as she climbs
text: the stairs and eventually shuts the door to her room.
text: Boolie, having lost this round, picks up the largest mason jar
dialog: of pickles to take home.
dialog: ON HIS FACE: How do I handle this?
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Daisy, wearing a light summer dressing gown, raises the
text: blinds. Sunlight floods the room and she looks out of the
dialog: window.
scene_heading: EXT. GARAGE - SAME TIME - DAISY'S POV
text: The garage stands empty, except for an old hand lawn mower and
text: a few gardening tools at one side.
scene_heading: INT. THE BEDROOM - SAME TIME
text: Daisy looks grim.
scene_heading: INT. THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - LATER THAT DAY
text: Daisy, now dressed, is on the phone.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Well, I need you now! I have to be
dialog: at the beauty shop in half an hour!
dialog: -.. No, I most certainly did not
dialog: know you had to call a minimum of
dialog: two hours ahead. I don't know why
dialog: you call yourself a taxicab company
dialog: if you can't provide taxicabs!
text: ON IDELLA, standing in the dining room doorway with a dusting
text: rag in her hand, listening.
speaker_heading: IDELLA
dialog: You call yo' son down at the plant,
dialog: he sen’ somebody to carry you.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: That won't be necessary. I'll
dialog: cancel the appointment and fix
dialog: my own hair.
speaker_heading: IDELLA
dialog: Sometimes I think you ain't got
dialog: the sense God gave a lemon!
text: Daisy glares at her, but Idella, with inalienable right on her
text: side, returns the glare with a calm nod of her head and goes
dialog: off about her business.
scene_heading: EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
scene_heading: INT. THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - SAME TIME
text: Boolie enters from the kitchen. He is wearing brand new
text: pressed jeans with the cuffs rolled up and a plaid short-
text: Sleeved shirt and a bandanna around his neck. It looks wrong
text: on him.
text: FLORINE, his wife, enters behind him. She is in her middle
text: thirties, dark-haired, slim, very fashionable, carefully made
text: up. ‘Right now she is wearing a full denim skirt down to her
dialog: ankles (I think they called them circle skirts) and a plaid
text: blouse exactly matching Boolie's shirt. She is also wearing
text: gold jewelry that doesn't quite go with this outfit.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: (calling upstairs)
dialog: Mama? You there?
speaker_heading: FLORINE
dialog: (also calling up)
dialog: Hey, Mother Werthan! It's just us!
text: ON DAISY, appearing at the landing, a book in her hand.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Why didn't you call?
speaker_heading: FLORINE
dialog: We can't stay.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (sizing up the outfits)
dialog: So I gather.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
text: The Millers are giving a hayride
dialog: for their anniversary.
speaker_heading: FLORINE
dialog: I had these made. Doesn’t your
dialog: baby look cute?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: That's not exactly the word I'd
dialog: pick.
text: Boolie takes the book out of her hand.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: I've been wanting to read this.
text: He looks through it.
speaker_heading: : BOOLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's due back tomorrow. Want me
dialog: to take it for you?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: No thank you. I will go to the
text: library on the streetcar.
text: Boolie, getting angry, starts to say something, but Florine
text: puts a hand on his arm to calm him.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Go on now. You don't want to
dialog: _ keep the horses waiting.
text: ON BOOLIE, exasperated.

text: book, walks down the driveway towards the street.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - MID-MORNING
text: Daisy, a young black maid, and a couple of others are waiting
text: at the bus stop. A City of Atlanta bus pulls up to the stop.
text: A couple of passengers emerge from the rear door. The waiting
text: passengers enter the bus, Daisy first, in deference to her
dialog: age, sex, and color.
scene_heading: INT. CITY BUS - SAME TIME
text: Daisy puts in correct fare, squeezes into a seat between a fat
text: country woman and a high school girl.
dialog: 10.
text: The black maid, the last one aboard, goes to the back of the
text: bus, where there are black people standing and no seats. The
text: front of the bus has seats available.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - SAME TIME
text: The bus rattles off down the avenue.
scene_heading: EXT. CARNEGIE LIBRARY BRANCH - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT
text: A one-story brick building on a residential shopping street.
text: Sign in front reads "Atlanta Public Library, Highland Avenue
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: The checkout desk. The young LIBRARIAN is stamping Daisy's
dialog: books.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: I've got that Revolutionary War
dialog: book you were asking about, Miz
dialog: Werthan. I put it aside for you.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: You're a sweet thing, Miss Jensen.
text: The Librarian reaches under the counter and pulls out the
text: book. It is enormous, more than a thousand pages.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: Everybody's just crazy about it!
text: Daisy eyes it dubiously as Librarian stamps it for her. -
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Well, thank you very much.
text: She turns from the desk and heads out the door, carrying the
text: huge book in the cradle of her arm.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIGGLY WIGGLY / PRODUCE SECTION - DAY

speaker_heading: PRODUCE MAN
dialog: How about a nice watermelon?
text: Daisy shakes her head "no," puts the paper sack of peaches
text: into her cart, which already contains one bar of soap, one
text: lamb chop, and a can of peas. She walks toward the checkout
dialog: counter.
scene_heading: EXIT. THE BUS STOP - DAY
text: Across the street from where Daisy started out. The bus rolls

scene_heading: EXT. THE WERTHAN COMPANY - DAY
text: A smallish turn-of-the-century brick factory built near the -
text: railroad tracks. A company truck is backed up to a loading
text: platform. Several black men are involved in loading large
text: cartons of printed material into the truck. A sleek, late-
text: model sedan is parked in the space marked "Reserved for Mr.
text: Werthan." A couple of less fancy cars are parked in other
text: reserved spots. A mid-week, mid-morning, business-as-usual
dialog: ay. .
scene_heading: INT. BOOLIE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME
text: Somebody (Florine) has tried to furnish this office well. It
text: contains a good leather couch, a couple of English-hunt-club-
text: type engravings and an expensive mahogany desk. A large Vogue-
text: magazine~-style photograph of Florine in a fancy hat is placed
text: prominently. Also there are company picnic photographs,
text: Boolie's Yale diploma, a Bacharach-type photograph of his
dialog: father, etc. All of the above does not quite hide the fact
text: that this room is part of an old factory. The walls are
text: patchy, the windows are old, and the venetian blinds are
text: grubby and sagging.
dialog: 12.
text: Boolie is at the desk and on the phone. During his phone
text: conversation a SHARP BELL is HEARD O.S. It RINGS
text: intermittently. He looks up, annoyed, then concerned, but
text: continues doing his business.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Well, I.W., you know as well as
dialog: I do that The Werthan Company isn't
dialog: the only printing company in Atlanta.
dialog: If you want to get other bids... oh,
dialog: you did. Well... that's what Ideal
dialog: bid, huh?... Okay. You ever do
dialog: business with Ideal before?
text: MISS MCCLATCHEY, his secretary, all business and about 30,
text: appears at the door. She seems distressed. He raises his
text: hand, palm up, telling her to wait.

speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Can you have lunch with me

speaker_heading: MISS MCCLATCHEY
dialog: Oscar's stuck in the freight

speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Damn that thing!
text: He gets up, leaves his office. She follows.
text: A SERIES OF SHOTS
text: A. A CORRIDOR. Boolie, followed by McClatchey, hurries down
text: a corridor. Glass-partitioned cubbyhole offices (3 or 4) with
text: men in shirtsleeves at desks, on phones, etc.
text: B. END OF THE CORRIDOR. Boolie opens a large metal double
text: door and they proceed to
text: C. THE FACTORY. An enormous room, full of printing presses

text: stacking material onto hand trucks, etc. The room is lit
text: mostly by the skylighted roof. Boolie and McClatchey hurry
dialog: through to
dialog: 13.
text: D. THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR. It is about four feet above the
text: ground. The old corrugated tin door is open and we SEE a pair

dialog: One! Did you tell them it's an
dialog: emergency? :
speaker_heading: MISS MCCLATCHEY
dialog: You don't have to holler at me, Mr.
dialog: Werthan. I didn't break the elevator.
text: A small crowd of workers has gathered behind Boolie. This is
dialog: an event.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: You got that stuff for Davison Paxon
dialog: in there, Oscar?
speaker_heading: OSCAR (0.S.)
text: Wrapped and ready to go.

dialog: yesterday. Call Bell back!
text: McClatchey goes off to the phone.

text: Boolie turns to look and so does the CAMERA. We SEE a

text: frayed old white-on-white shirt and a sad-looking tie.
text: Clearly somebody down on his luck.
speaker_heading: THE OLD MAN

text: A LOUD THUMP, A WHIRR OF MOTOR, and OSCAR, a black man in his
text: forties, dressed in a porter's uniform, appears at ground
text: level in the elevator, stacks of printed material behind him.
text: A light round of APPLAUSE, workers immediately start packing
text: the material onto hand trucks and moving it out.

text: And I right behind her, Idella.
scene_heading: INT. THE TEMPLE - SAME DAY
dialog: We are in the large sanctuary of the Temple, the Atlanta
dialog: Reform Jewish Congregation. The building was designed in the
text: twenties, and somehow this sanctuary carries a ‘sense of the
text: Bible as interpreted by C.B. DeMille. The room has a very
text: large chandelier, lots of large windows, and is decorated with
text: white walls and gold relief work. The Arc for the Torah
text: itself is all gold relief work. The whole place gives off a
text: scent of well-being and not too much religious warmth. .
text: We are approaching the end of the Saturday morning service.
text: The RABBI, who prefers to call himself DR. WEIL, is conducting
text: the service in a morning coat. There are no yarmulkes or any
text: other Jewish paraphernalia in sight.
dialog: The sanctuary is sparsely populated this (and every) Saturday
text: morning. In the front couple of rows sit the Confirmation
text: Class, some thirty or so tenth-graders who have to appear
dialog: every Saturday in order to get confirmed at the end of the
dialog: year.
text: They are standard issue high school sophomores, dressed well
dialog: and appropriately for a religious service. None of them seem
dialog: very interested in the service. Some look just plain bored,
text: others are miles away, and still others (girls) are passing
text: notes and/or giggling.
text: Most of the rest of the room is empty. There are a few
text: worshippers in pairs or alone scattered throughout.
dialog: 36.
text: The last few rows are more populated. Here are the older
text: members of the congregation, mostly widows, some older men,
text: and a few grown sons/daughters. Daisy is in the next to the
text: last row, sitting very straight in the pew, her back not
text: touching the seat.

scene_heading: EXT. THE TEMPLE - SAME TIME
text: The front elevator of the building. It is a clear autumn day.
text: Daisy, Miriam and Beulah come out of the building. Daisy is

text: her face.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT OF THE TEMPLE - SAME TIME - DAISY'S POV
text: Her car, Hoke standing politely by the passenger door in the
text: rear, is directly in front of the building. A couple of other
text: chauffeur-driven sedans are behind it.
text: Daisy scurries down the steps as fast as she can. She waves
text: goodbye to her friends, gets in the car, sitting up very
text: straight and making sure she slams the door for herself.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I can get myself in. Just go.
dialog: Hurry up out of here!
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Yassum.
text: Hoke, confused, scurries around to the driver's seat and sets

text: The car moves down the driveway and into Saturday traffic.

speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: What that?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: That I'm trying to pretend I'm rich.
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: You is rich, Miz Daisy!
speaker_heading: . DAISY
dialog: No I'm not. And nobody can ever say
dialog: I put on airs. On Forsyth Street we
dialog: only had meat once a week. We made a
dialog: meal off of grits and gravy. I taught

dialog: School. I did without plenty of times,

scene_heading: INT. DAISY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Pitch black dark. Suddenly an electric light snaps on. We
text: are in Daisy's DINING ROOM. It is very early in the morning.
text: Daisy is wearing her winter bathrobe and warm slippers. She
text: is concerned. We SEE her go through the drawers of her
text: buffet. She isn't finding what she's looking for. We FOLLOW
speaker_heading: DAISY into
scene_heading: THE PANTRY CLOSET
text: where she pulls an overhead light string. The pantry is a
text: walk-in closet. There are numerous cans and preserved goods
text: on the shelves. Daisy looks at the cans, suddenly pushes one

scene_heading: THE BREAKFAST ROOM

speaker_heading: FLORINE
dialog: Guess who?
speaker_heading: BOOLIE

dialog: My Lord!

speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Good morning, Mama. What's the :

speaker_heading: FLORINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Coffee, Gaynell!
scene_heading: INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Daisy, still in her bathrobe, paces back and forth, looking

text: the door.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: I didn't expect to find you in one
dialog: piece.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I wanted you to be here when he comes.
dialog: I wanted you to hear it for yourself.
speaker_heading: BOOLTE
dialog: Hear what? What is going on?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: He's stealing from me.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Hoke? Are you sure?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I don't make empty accusations. I

speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: What proof?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: This!
text: She triumphantly pulls an empty can of salmon out of her robe
dialog: pocket.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)
dialog: I caught him red-handed! I found
text: this hidden in the garbage pail
text: under some coffee grounds.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: You mean he stole a can of salmon?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Here it is! Oh, I knew. I knew
dialog: something was funny. They all take
dialog: things, you know. So I counted.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: You counted?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: The silverware first and then the
dialog: linen dinner napkins and then I went
text: into the pantry. I turned on the
dialog: light and the first thing that caught
text: my eye was a hole behind the corned
dialog: beef. And I knew right away. There
dialog: were only eight cans of salmon. I
dialog: had nine. Three for a dollar on sale.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Very clever, Mama. You made me miss
dialog: my breakfast and be late for a
text: meeting at the bank for a thirty-three
dialog: cent can of salmon.
text: He jams his hand into his pocket and pulls out some bills.
speaker_heading: BOOLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. You want thirty-three cents?
dialog: Here's a dollar! Here's ten dollars!
text: Buy a pantry full of salmon.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Why, Boolie! The idea! Waving money

speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: One can of salmon?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Well, it was mine! I bought it and I
dialog: put it there and he went into my

speaker_heading: DAISY (CONT'D)
dialog: They want something so they just take

dialog: it! I don't like living this way! I
dialog: have no privacy!
speaker_heading: BOOLIE

speaker_heading: DAISY

speaker_heading: BOOLIE

scene_heading: INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE DEN - DAY - APRIL
text: It is Saturday afternoon. Daisy sits in a comfortable chair.
text: She is listening to a period console RADIO which sits on a
text: nearby table. It's the Saturday broadcast of the Met. The
text: sextet from "Lucia di Lammermoor" is BLASTING forth and Daisy
text: hums along happily as she does a bit of crewel work. Hoke,
text: passing in the hall, stands a minute in the open door frame,
text: smiling at what he sees.
scene_heading: EXT. CREST CEMETERY - DAY - MAY, 1951
text: A full, fuzzy-green, warm morning. Although this is a
dialog: cemetery, it is not depressing -- not today, anyway, in the
text: bright sunlight. The red-clay Georgia soil looks particularly
dialog: soft.
text: Daisy's car is parked off to the side of one of the narrow
text: roadways. The car is not quite so new now, but still well-
text: kept. Hoke is carefully buffing the front grillwork with his
dialog: trusty old chamois cloth. We can SEE the Georgia license
dialog: plate which reads 1951, so a couple of years have passed since
text: the last scene.
dialog: 45.
text: Twenty feet or so from him, Daisy is kneeling by a well-tended
text: grave. The headstone reads "WERTHAN." The small stone at the
text: foot on one side reads "Sigmund Werthan" with his dates. The
text: other side is unused. Daisy is digging with her trowel,
text: planting verbena. Hoke ambles over.
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: I jess thinkin', Miz Daisy. We bin

speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Boolie's always pestering me to let

dialog: Perpetual care they call it.
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Well, doan you do it. It right to
dialog: have somebody from the family looking
dialog: after you.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I'll certainly never have that.

dialog: before I'm cold.
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Go on ‘way from here!
speaker_heading: DAISY _
dialog: Hoke, run on back to the car and get
dialog: that pot of azaleas for me and set it
text: on Leo Bauer's grave.
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Miz Rose Bauer's husband?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: That's right. She asked me to bring

dialog: good about coming. And I believe

speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Yassum. Where the grave at?
speaker_heading: HOKE'S POV -
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I'm not exactly sure. But I know
dialog: it's over that way on the other side
dialog: of the weeping cherry. You'll see
text: the headstone. Bauer.
text: a veritable sea of look-alike headstones.
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Yassum.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Nothin' the matter.
text: He goes back to the car and gets the azaleas. Daisy goes on
text: with her digging.
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Miz Daisy...
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I told you, it's over on the other
text: side of the weeping cherry. It says
text: Bauer on the headstone.
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Now, how do that look?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: I'm talkin' 'bout I cain' read.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: I cain' read.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: That's ridiculous. Anybody can read.
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Nome. Not me.
speaker_heading: DAISY

speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: My ABC's? Yassum, pretty good. I
dialog: jes' cain' read.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Stop saying that. It's making me mad.
dialog: If you know your letters then you can
dialog: read. You just don't know you can
dialog: read. I taught some of the stupidest
dialog: children God ever put on the face of
dialog: this earth and all of them could read
text: enough to find a name on a tombstone.
dialog: The name is Bauer. Buh buh buh buh
dialog: buh Bauer. What does that buh letter
dialog: sound like?
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Soun' like a B.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Of course. Buh Bauer. Er er er er
dialog: er. BauER. That's the last part.
dialog: What letter sounds like er?
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: An R?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: So the first letter is a --
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: B.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: And the last letter is an --
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: R.
speaker_heading: DAISY
scene_heading: B-R.. B-R. B-R. Buh-err. Buh-err.
dialog: It even sounds like Bauer, doesn't it?
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Sho' do, Miz Daisy. Thass it?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: That's it. Now go on over there like
dialog: I told you in the first place and
dialog: look for a headstone with a B at the
text: beginning and an R at the end and
dialog: that will be Bauer. :
speaker_heading: HOKE .
dialog: We ain' gon' worry ‘bout what come in
dialog: the middle?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Not right now. This will be enough
dialog: for you to find it. Go on now.
speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: Yassum.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: And don't come back here telling me
dialog: you can't do it. Because you can.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CEMETERY - SAME TIME
text: We FOLLOW HOKE on his walk past the weeping cherry tree,
text: carrying the potted azalea in front of him. He is cautious,
text: but excited. The headstones loom in front of him, somehow
text: suddenly menacing. But he proceeds. And, sure enough, there
dialog: it is -- BAUER. . .
text: He silently mouths the Buh and the Er and places the azaleas
text: gently in front of the headstone. A big moment for him.
text: Then, walking quickly, he heads back to where Daisy is
text: finishing up her digging and collecting her things.
speaker_heading: HOKE

dialog: Honey! Boolie! I need you!
speaker_heading: BOOLIE

speaker_heading: KITCHEN
text: An early fifties dream of a kitchen, newly appointed. Every

speaker_heading: KATIE BELL
dialog: I tole her.
speaker_heading: FLORINE
dialog: But you didn't write it down! I don't

speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Florine! Florine!
speaker_heading: FLORINE (0.S.)
dialog: In here.

scene_heading: A SECOND BEDROOM
dialog: At least it was intended to be a bedroom because it is good-
text: sized. This room is Florine's clothes closet. Racks of
text: clothes are everywhere like a fancy dress store; shoes, hats,

scene_heading: INT. AUBURN AVENUE BAPTIST CHURCH / THE SANCTUARY - DAY
text: This is a fairly small church, humble in contrast to Daisy's
dialog: Temple we have seen earlier. The sanctuary is about half-
text: filled at the moment. A funeral is in progress.
scene_heading: A BLACK CHOIR MEMBER - A TEEN-AGED GIRL, with a particularly
text: strong voice, is singing "What a Friend we Have in Jesus."
text: She wears a choir robe. She is standing with the rest of the
text: choir, but this is the solo part of the service.
text: A MINISTER, also black and also robed, stands nearby, just
text: behind a simple coffin.
text: A SHOT OF THE SANCTUARY reveals that the entire population is
text: black, except for three white people in the rear -- Daisy,
text: Boolie and Florine. Hoke is sitting in the pew with them, on
text: the aisle, next to Boolie. Everyone in the congregation holds
text: a printed program of events.
text: ON THE THREE WHITE FACES, a part of the service, but not a
text: part. Florine wears a stylish suit, Daisy has on a black hat
text: with a veil. She looks straight ahead at the singer, her face
text: showing no emotion. Only Hoke's face expresses his feelings,
text: as the four watch the solemn proceedings.
scene_heading: INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE KITCHEN - DAY - JULY, SAME YEAR
text: For the first time, the kitchen looks a bit out of date, a bit
text: shabby. The linoleum is clean, but a little chipped and
text: scruffy. An electric fry pan sits on one of the counters,
text: . Clearly a concession to Boolie because it is shiny new and
dialog: ebviously never used. -
text: Daisy is frying chicken in a large black cast iron skillet.
text: The cut-up chicken is on the counter as is the paper bag full
text: of flour. She shakes the chicken in the bag, then places it
text: in the hot oil skillet.
text: Hoke appears behind her, watching critically. Eventually he

speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: You fixin' to ruin it.

scene_heading: EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE YARD - DAY
text: Some time later. Daisy, wearing gardening gloves, is standing

scene_heading: INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE FRONT HALL - IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
dialog: No furniture or decoration has changed here since we first saw
text: it, but everything is older. Daisy is on her knees rummaging
text: through the lowest commode drawer. Outside the storm is
text: visible. The hall is dark. Daisy finds what she is looking
text: for, a stumpy old white candle. She shuts the drawer, gets
text: up, and we FOLLOW HER through
text: THE DARK PANTRY into
speaker_heading: THE KITCHEN
text: somewhat lighter because of the windows. She lights the
text: candle with kitchen matches, drips wax onto a saucer, and
text: firms the candle in place. She heads back towards the living
dialog: room.
dialog: 81.
text: She walks through the dark HALL. We FOLLOW HER into
speaker_heading: THE LIVING ROOM
text: Only a little brighter, evidence of ice storm outside. The
text: room seems more cluttered, less organized than it was in 1948.
text: And the darkness of the morning only accentuates the somewhat
text: shabby aura.
text: Daisy goes to sit in her armchair. The current National
text: Geographic is on the table. She picks it up and tries to
text: read, but is unsuccessful in the poor light.
text: Suddenly she HEARS the BACK DOOR open and close. FOOTSTEPS.
text: She half-rises out of the chair in alarm.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: HOKE (0.S.)
dialog: Mornin', Miz Daisy.
speaker_heading: DAISY

speaker_heading: HOKE
dialog: I learn to drive on ice when I

speaker_heading: HOKE (0.S.)

dialog: A mess?
text: This is an old routine between them and not without affection.

speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: How in the hell did he manage that?
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: He's very handy. I'm fine. I don't

speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Hello?
dialog: (to Florine)
dialog: I must have the wrong number. I

speaker_heading: DAISY

speaker_heading: BOOLIE

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: A traffic jam is in progress. Cars standing still, HORNS

text: One of the cars in the stalled lane is Daisy's. It's a car we
dialog: haven't seen before -- a Cadillac sedan (circa 1960). All of
text: Daisy's cars, subsequent to the first Cadillac, are virtually
dialog: the same -- all "Cadillac blue" -- but, of course, Boolie
dialog: trades them in every two or three years -- a matter of equity.
text: At the moment Daisy is alone in her car, fanning herself with

dialog: I see. The Werthan Company will go

speaker_heading: BOOLIE
dialog: Not exactly. But a lot of men I do
dialog: business with wouldn't like it. They
dialog: might snicker a little and call me
dialog: Martin Luther Werthan behind my back --
dialog: something like that. And I'd begin to
dialog: notice that my banking business wasn't
dialog: being handled by the top dogs. Maybe
dialog: I wouldn't hear about certain lunch
dialog: meetings at the Commerce Club. And
dialog: Jack Raphael, over at Ideal Press, he's
dialog: a New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew
dialog: and the really smart Jews come from New
dialog: York, don't they? So some of the boys
dialog: might start throwing business to Jack
text: instead of old Martin Luther Werthan.
dialog: I don't know. Maybe it wouldn't happen,
