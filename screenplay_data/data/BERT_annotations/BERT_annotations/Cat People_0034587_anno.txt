dialog: THE CAT PEOPE by DeWitt Bodeen
dialog: brought to you by The Val Lewton Screenplay Collection
speaker_heading: THE CAT PEOPLE
dialog: Original Screen Play
dialog: by DeWitt Bodeen
text: The RKO trademark FADES OFF, leaving a black screen, in the
text: center of which are two slits of pale light. These move
text: closer until we see that they are a pair of cat's eyes. Over
text: these mysteriously blinking lights the title is SUPERIMPOSED.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
text: A misty OUT-OF-FOCUS SHOT of a black panther pacing behind
text: cage bars. Over this come the production credits. A pale
text: fog rises over the shot of the black panther, and over it
dialog: Is SUPERIMPOSED the following quotation:
text: EVEN AS FOG CONTINUES TO LIE IN THE VALLEYS, SO DOES ANCIENT
text: SIN CLING TO THE LOW PLACES, THE DEPRESSIONS IN THE WORLD
scene_heading: CONSCIOUSNESS.
speaker_heading: SIGMUND FREUD
scene_heading: EXT. ZOO PROMENADE - PARK - AFTERNOON
text: As the last word of the quotation FADES from the screen, the
text: fog clears, the caged leopard comes into full focus, and we
text: see that it is an actual leopard behind actual bars. Over
text: the scene is the wheezy music of the Triumphal March from
text: "Aida," as played on a hand, organ. This is playing in the
text: distance, and we do not see the organ-grinder until later.
text: The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show a young artist sitting before
text: the cage on a campstool with a drawing portfolio in her hand.
text: She is presumably sketching the panther, although her drawing
text: is not shown, and we do not see the features of the girl's
text: face. The girl picks up the drawing and holds it off,
text: weighing its values. It evidently does not meet with her
text: approval, for she wads the drawing Into a ball and turns to
text: look for a place to throw the waste paper. We see her face.
text: It is heart-shaped, demure, even a little naive. She is
text: small, young,and very beautiful. In one hand the wad of
text: waste paper is poised, ready to throw into a container.
text: INSERT WASTEPAPER BASKET as Irena sees it.
text: It is a rather fancy container in the shape of a tree
dialog: trunk.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (then continuing in the
dialog: same tone)
dialog: "Sometimes whoever seeks abroad
dialog: may find Thee sitting careless on
dialog: a granary floor, Thy hair soft
dialog: lifted...
text: (ponders, as if trying to
dialog: remember) Thy hair soft
dialog: lifted..."
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (snapping her compact
dialog: shut)
dialog: Reminds me. I have a date with the
dialog: hairdresser.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: What a way to spend a Saturday
dialog: afternoon!
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: The business girl's holiday
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You should've minded your mother
dialog: and eaten more bread crusts. You'd
dialog: have curly hair now.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Thank you for lunch. See you at
dialog: the office Monday.
text: She starts off down the promenade. She walks briskly in one
text: direction, while Oliver turns the other way, ambling toward
text: the leopard cage. Along the promenade a file of Saturday
text: afternoon idlers goes by. Oliver moves up to the cages and
text: pauses at the guard rail before the leopard cage. Near him
text: sits Irena, busily sketching. Oliver looks at her, but she
text: does not look up at him. She gets up and moves a few steps,
text: her eyes intent on the movements of the panther, which is
text: walking about In its cage. Oliver politely steps aside so
text: that she can get a better vantage point. She does not even
text: notice him. She frowns at her drawing, wads the paper into a
text: ball, and turns to throw it into the container. Oliver steps
text: before her, smiling and extending his hand. She looks at him
text: a moment, then smiles and drops the wad of paper into his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Thank you.
text: With an easy aim, Oliver tosses it neatly into the container
text: and turns to her with a shrug, as if to say how easy it was.
text: But Irena has picked up another drawing upon which she has
text: worked and is now studying it. The music of the organ-grinder
text: grows constantly louder as the scene progresses.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You won't believe this, and
dialog: you've probably heard it a dozen
dialog: times before...but I've never
dialog: known any artists.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: I'm not an artist, really... not a
dialog: real artist...just a sketch artist
dialog: for fashion drawings.
text: She has picked up the drawing and is holding it in her hand
text: with its back toward Oliver, who extends his hand.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: May I see it?
text: Irena smiles but shakes her head as she tears the drawing
text: about two-thirds of the way through, dropping it face down
text: upon the pavement.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Oh, no. It's not good. If I let you
dialog: see it, you might not want to know
dialog: any artists...ever.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (SMILING AT HER)
dialog: I'm afraid it would have to be
dialog: pretty bad to do that. Besides,
dialog: look... (pointing to a drawing she
text: had dropped, quoting in a mocking
dialog: tone)
dialog: "Let no one say, and say it to
dialog: your shame..."
text: Irena laughs and starts to pick up the paper, but a gust of
text: wind blows it down the promenade. She turns to Oliver and
text: shrugs her shoulders. She starts to fold up her campstool.
text: Oliver comes forward to offer his assistance. At the same
text: time the organ-grinder passes between them and the camera,
text: playing "Aida" on his hand organ. Oliver asks Irena if he may
text: help her, but the music is so loud she cannot hear him. He
text: assists Irena in gathering up her things. He takes the
text: campstool, and Irena carries her artist's portfolio. They
text: start toward the avenue together.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the torn drawing as a little wind, carrying
text: with it some autumn leaves, picks up the paper again and
text: blows it over and over up the promenade. The torn half of
text: the drawing falls over into place, so we see what Irena had
text: been drawing. It is a smart fashion sketch of the type seen
text: in Vogue or Harper's Bazaar, but the face of the model is the
text: blunt mask of a black panther, and the hands protruding from
text: the sleeves are tipped with feline talons. The CAMERA HOLDS
text: on the drawing.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON
text: TWO SHOT of Irena and Oliver as they walk down a side street.
text: Irena is looking straight ahead of her, amused. Oliver is
text: doing his best to get acquainted.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Irena Dubrovna -- is that a Russian
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: No...I am from Serbia.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I see. Would you mind spelling it?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: You want to know how to spell my
dialog: name? Are you going to write me a
dialog: letter?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I'd like to write you a letter.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: What about?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I would say in this letter... "Dear
dialog: Miss...Dubrovna," I would say,
dialog: "will you have tea with me?"
text: Irena shakes her head with a little smile. Oliver is
text: undaunted.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well, in that case, I'd just have
dialog: to write you another letter, I'd
dialog: say...
text: But again, with the same teasing smile, she shakes her
text: head. She suddenly stops and TURNS to Oliver.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Here is my house.
text: Oliver starts to give her the campstool he is carrying, She
text: lays a soft, gloved hand on his coat sleeve and smiles
text: charmingly.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Perhaps, Mr. Reed, you would like
dialog: to have tea in my apartment.
text: Oliver looks at her quizzically, realizing that she had meant
dialog: to ask him all the time, that he needn't have tried so hard
text: to wangle a date. He grins.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Oh, Miss Dubrovna, you make life so
dialog: simple!
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - IRENA'S APARTMENT HOUSE
speaker_heading: AFTERNOON
text: MED. SHOT of Irena and Oliver as they enter the building
text: from the street. It is the ornate, elaborate interior of a
text: brownstone mansion converted into an apartment house. They
text: walk the few steps of the short hallway to the stairs.
text: Oliver looks at the enormous staircase.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (POINTING)
dialog: I never cease to marvel at what
text: lies behind a brownstone front.
text: They start up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE IRENA'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
text: MED. SHOT. Irena has inserted the key in the lock of her
text: door. She turns it, but before she opens the door, she looks
text: up at Oliver.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: But you looked at me in such a
dialog: funny way.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: I've never had anyone here. You're
dialog: the first friend I've met in
dialog: America. I know lots of people in
dialog: business...editors, secretaries,
dialog: other sketch artists...you know.
dialog: But you might be my first real
dialog: friend. That's why I looked at
dialog: you.
dialog: (pauses)
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Irena swings the door wide open. Through the doorway a
text: little bit of the room can be seen. Prominently displayed
text: is an odd equestrian statuette.
text: It is the figure of a man in armor, carved out of gray
text: stone. The man wears a regal chaplet on his head and is
text: mounted on a magnificent horse. Around the base of the
text: statue is a circle of flames, while the rider holds high
text: above his head a sword upon which is impaled the figure of
text: a writhing cat. Irena takes a step into the room and stands
text: waiting for Oliver to follow her, then turns to look back
text: at him. He has become aware of the perfume in the room.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: Mm. Nice.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: That's Lalage.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Lalage?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: The perfume I use. I like it,
dialog: perhaps too well. Maybe I use too
dialog: much of it, living alone like this.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Oh, I like it all right. It's hard
dialog: to describe...not like
dialog: flowers...it's like something warm
dialog: and living.
text: As he goes on into the room, she closes the door.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE IN
scene_heading: INT. IRENA'S LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT
text: MED. CLOSE SHOT of statuette. The figure is silhouetted
text: against a window dim with twilight. As the CAMERA HOLDS on
text: the statuette, a light appears in a bay window across the
text: street, bringing the figures of horse, king, and cat into
text: dramatic focus. Over the shot we hear Irena's voice humming
dialog: "Berceuses du Chat" by Stravinsky.
text: The CAMERA PANS to show Irena and Oliver seated together on a
text: couch near the window. Because of the dim light in the room
text: they can barely be seen. Oliver is listening to her sing. She
text: ends her song, and they sit quietly for a moment. Suddenly,
text: as sometimes happens, there is a lull in the traffic outside.
text: In this momentary stillness, this stillness in which a great
text: city seems to catch its breath, Oliver hears the sound of
text: distant roaring, muffled and yet full of savage
text: reverberation.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (looking toward Irena)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: It's the lions in the zoo. One can
dialog: hear them here often. Many people
dialog: in this building complain. The
text: roaring keeps them awake.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: And you don't mind it?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: No. To me it's the way the sound
dialog: of the sea is to others, natural
dialog: and soothing. I like it.
text: She looks out the window, then turns back to Oliver.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
text: Some nights there is another sound.
text: The panther. It screams... like a
dialog: woman. I don't like that.
text: Oliver strikes a match to light his cigarette. He looks at
text: Irena's face in the dancing match light. She smiles at him.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: I hadn't realized how dark it was
dialog: getting.
text: She rises and goes over to a lamp. She speaks in a sighing
dialog: breath of ecstasy.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: I like the dark. It is friendly.
text: She turns on the lamp. Now, in the light, we see her
text: apartment â a nicely proportioned living room with a little
text: fireplace set under a neat Georgian mantel. Doors at either
text: end of the room lead off into small bedrooms. Behind a
text: fantastic three-part screen on which is painted the long,
text: sleek figure of a black leopard against a background of
text: jungle foliage, is concealed the two-burner stove, tiny sink,
text: and old-fashioned icebox which make up the kitchenette. In
text: the other corner, under the wide window, are a drawing board
text: and a desk, littered with crayons, brushes, bottles of
text: discolored water, and papers. On one side of the wall, in
text: neat frames, hang three of Grandville's amusing studies of
text: cats dressed as humans. Over the mantel hangs a beautiful
text: reproduction of Goya's sinister portrait of Don Manuel Osorio
text: do Zunlga and the cats. In front of Oliver, on the coffee
text: table, are the remnants of their tea. Irena comes down to
text: pick the tray up to take it into the kitchenette. Oliver
text: starts to help her, but she stops him.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: No, no. Sit still, please.
text: She begins to dump the ash trays and collect the saucers and
text: cups. Oliver smokes contentedly. Irena carries the tray
text: behind the screen. Oliver snuffs out the cigarette and picks
text: the statue up, holding it for a moment in his hand.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
text: (coming out from behind
dialog: screen; eagerly)
dialog: Are you admiring my statue?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (who does not like it at
dialog: all)
dialog: Not exactly. Who's it supposed to
dialog: be?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: King John.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: King John? The Magna Carta and
dialog: stuff?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Oh, no. King John of Serbia. He
dialog: was a fine king. He drove the
dialog: Mamelukes out of Serbia and freed
dialog: the people.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: But why have this around?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Perhaps you have in your room a
dialog: picture of George Washington or
dialog: Abraham Lincoln?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (still unconvinced)
dialog: Aren't there some better statues of
dialog: him -- some without that cat thing?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Yes. There are beautiful statues
dialog: of King John. There is one in
text: Belgrade, where his face shines
dialog: with goodness. But this statue
dialog: reminds me of my home, the little
dialog: village where I was born. This is
text: the statue that stands in the
dialog: square.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: But what does it mean? Why is he
dialog: spearing that cat?
text: Irena turns, her back to the fireplace mantel. In her hand
text: is the statue of King John. Above her, to one side, the three
text: cats in the Goya portrait glare from the shadowed background.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: It's not really a cat. It's
dialog: meant to represent the evil ways
dialog: into which my village once had
dialog: fallen. You see, the Mamelukes
dialog: came to Serbia long, long ago,
dialog: and they made the people slaves.
dialog: But my village was too little,
text: too far away in the mountains.
dialog: They left it alone. For five
dialog: hundred years my little village
dialog: was cut off from the Mother
dialog: Church. At first the people were
dialog: good and worshipped God in a true
dialog: Christian way. But, little by
dialog: little, the people changed. When
dialog: King John drove out the Mamelukes
dialog: and came to our village he found
dialog: dreadful things. The people bowed
dialog: down to Satan and said their
text: Masses to him. They had become
dialog: witches and were evil. King John
dialog: put some of them to the sword and
dialog: burned some of them in fires.
text: (pauses, drops her voice
dialog: a little)
dialog: But some --the wisest and the
dialog: most wicked -- escaped into the
dialog: mountains.
dialog: (looks at Oliver) )
dialog: Now, do you understand?
text: Oliver comes over beside her near the mantel.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I still don't see what it has to do
dialog: with you.
text: Irena looks down at the statue of King John. There is a
text: haunting look of memory in her eyes.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Those who escaped â the wicked ones
dialog: -- their legend haunts the village
dialog: where I was born. The past
dialog: remains...
text: She breaks off suddenly, conscious that she has spoken too
text: much and too frankly. A little ormolu clock on the mantel
text: strikes the hour. It is six. It is obvious that Irena
text: welcomes the interruption and she glances down at her own
text: wrist watch. Oliver takes the hint. He starts toward the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
text: (as he picks up his
dialog: things)
dialog: Boys who come to tea can't expect
dialog: to stay to dinner.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE IRENA'S APARTMENT & STAIRWAY - TWILIGHT
text: Irena has followed Oliver out and stands in the doorway
text: Oliver turns to look at her.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: When am I going to see you again?
dialog: Tomorrow?
text: Irena nods with a smile, Oliver continues to the head of the
text: stairs and turns back.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: What time tomorrow?
text: Irena shrugs her shoulders.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: Dinner?
text: Irena nods and smiles at him.
text: SHOT of stairway as Oliver comes down the stairs. He reaches
text: a landing, turns, and looks up, Irena is looking down at him
text: from the bannister. They both smile. He continues down the
text: stairs. At the very bottom he looks up again. Irena is still
text: standing watching him. He smiles up at her and exits.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: INT. DRAFTING OFFICE - MORNING
dialog: WIDE VIEW. The Consolidated Ship and Barge Construction
text: Company has a handsome drafting office. Severe and modern,
text: it is nevertheless a room that immediately suggests
text: shipbuilding. A wide doorway opens in from the hall, in the
text: f.g. are three draftsmen's tables, glass-topped and lighted
text: from beneath. Behind them are several tables for other
text: workers. There are a number of rows of filing cabinets, and
text: at one side is a water cooler. The back wall of the office
text: is unadorned, wide, and slightly curving. At the moment, a
text: group of office workers are just starting to paste up the
text: sectional plans of a ship, entitled "PROJECT NO. 457," on
text: this wall. The ship's bow can be seen taking form in
dialog: detailed constructional profile.
text: Two of the three draftsmen's tables in the f.g. are now
text: occupied. Oliver sits working at one of them.
text: The center one is unoccupied. At the other one, a tall,
text: lean Englishman works. This is James Carver. At the back
text: wall, Alice Moore is supervising two workers, who are doing
text: the actual pasting. She holds in her hands a small sheet of
dialog: paper with the detailed mathematical measurements of the
dialog: project,
text: Beside her, Commodore Judson, head of the Consolidated Ship
text: and Barge Construction Company, stands watching the beginning
text: of the project with genuine delight. He is a bald, bearded
text: gentleman and would look like an amiable tramp rather than
dialog: the head of a successful shipbuilding company, if it were not
text: for the seamanlike neatness of his clothes.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (motioning to one of the
dialog: men at the wall)
text: A little more to the left, Harry.
dialog: Easy...just a hair...
text: She lifts her hand to indicate that it's in position.
speaker_heading: COMMODORE
dialog: By George! This is going to bo
dialog: our best yet. Wait till she rides
dialog: into Tokyo Bay.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: She's got what it takes all right,
dialog: Commodore.
text: Alice turns and goes to the desk between Oliver and Jim
text: Carver. She picks up a sheet of paper from the desk and is
text: just about to return to the wall, when she is stopped by
text: the sound of a cat's mewing. She listens. The mew is
text: repeated. Carver raises his head and also listens. Alice
text: takes a look at the floor under and around her desk,
text: Oliver is still bending over his work, Alice looks
text: suspiciously and questioningly at Carver, Carver replies by
text: throwing his hands out to show that he doesn't know,and
text: then pointing to himself and shaking his head to announce
text: that the mew is not coming from him. The mewing continues
dialog: during this, which is one reason Carver and Alice do not
text: speak. They are listening. Alice and Carver both turn and
dialog: look at Oliver, He knows very well that they are looking at
text: him, and his pose is one of elaborate innocence. There is a
text: light cardboard box on his desk.
text: The CAMERA FOCUSES on it as the lid of the box rises, and
text: the head of a very small Siamese kitten pokes out, Alice
text: hurries to Oliver's desk, uttering a cross between a coo
text: and a cry of pleased surprise.
speaker_heading: ALICE (cont'd)
dialog: A-a-ah!
text: She picks up the kitten and cuddles it against her cheek.
speaker_heading: ALICE (cont'd)
dialog: It's a darling! Where'd you got
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Bought it.
text: The Commodore has joined them.
speaker_heading: COMMODORE
dialog: You're not going to start keeping
dialog: cats, are you?
dialog: (scratching kitten's head)
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: No, Commodore, I just got it for a
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: CARVER
text: We arrive at the inescapable
dialog: conclusion that our Oliver
dialog: (he is addressing the
dialog: assembled multitude)
dialog: has a girl.
speaker_heading: COMMODORE
dialog: A brilliant deduction.
text: He takes Carver's arm and draws him away/
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: A girl friend?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (almost as if correcting her)
text: A girl.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Anybody I know?
text: Oliver takes the kitten and puts it back into the box. It
text: makes vain efforts to scramble out past his restraining
dialog: hand,
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Not yet, but I know you'll like
dialog: her.
text: Alice watches him try to got the cover of the box over the
text: protesting kitten.
speaker_heading: ALICE (SPEAKING LIGHTLY)
dialog: If you like her, she's okay with
dialog: me.
text: CAMERA PANS DOWN to CLOSE SHOT of kitten, and as the lid of
dialog: the box hides It from view, we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE IRENA'S APARTMENT - NOON
text: MED. SHOT. Oliver, with the boxed kitten under one arm, is
text: ringing the bell to Irena's apartment. After a moment, she
text: opens the door. She is wearing a paint-stained smock and has
text: obviously boon interrupted in her work. She smiles at Oliver,
text: and he bends down to put the box on the floor.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Look, Irena. I brought you a
dialog: present.
text: He takes the kitten out of the box and sets it on the floor.
text: Irena stoops down beside it. Seeing her, the kitten draws
text: back, arching itself. Oliver, puzzled, looks from the cat to
text: Irena. She leans forward, smiling, trying to coax the kitten
text: to come to her. The kitten snarls and spits viciously at her.
text: Oliver scoops it up in his hands.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: Why, you little devil!
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (as she rises to her feet)
dialog: It's all right. It's just that
dialog: cats don't seem to like me.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: But this is only a kitten. It's
dialog: very friendly. When I had it in the
dialog: office, Alice â the girl who works
dialog: in our department â it played with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (smiling uncomfortably)
dialog: Cats just don't like me.
text: Oliver has stuffed the kitten back into its box and put the
text: lid over it. He is obviously disappointed. Irena puts her
text: hand on Oliver's arm.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: (Brightly)
dialog: I know what we can do. You got it
dialog: at a pet store, didn't you?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Good. We could exchange it for some
dialog: other pet?
text: She looks up at him. He nods.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: I'll get my hat and coat.
text: She turns to go back into the apartment for her coat and hat.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. PET STORE - DAY
text: All is tranquil in Miss Plunkett's Pet Shoppe. Outside it
text: is raining, a soft autumn rain. Miss Plunkett sits nodding.
text: Most of the birds and animals are sleeping. Above Miss
text: Plunkett, in a circular stand, a brilliant macaw swings. It
text: looks very much like Miss Plunkett, and, like her, is
text: peacefully nodding in sleep. A little bell tinkles, and
text: there is the sound of the door opening and closing. Miss
text: Plunkett sleeps right on. We see that Irena and Oliver have
text: entered the shop. Immediately there is a transformation.
text: The birds begin to call back and forth to one another,
text: their calls growing excited, shrill. The monkeys, awakened,
text: clamber excitedly in their cages, whimpering and chattering
text: madly. The puppies begin to bark, the cats to meow. In a
text: moment the sound has grown to sheer cacophony. The macaw,
text: too, has awakened, and is screeching its head off. Miss
text: Plunkett snaps out of her stolen rest and looks about her,
text: blinking curiously. Her lips form the words of amazement,
dialog: "Landie, dearie me!" but there is so much noise now that
text: nothing she says can be heard. She looks up to see what
dialog: may have startled the animals into such noisy activity;
text: MED. SHOT of Irena and Oliver, as they stand, perplexed by
text: all the commotion. Oliver is closing an umbrella. Miss
text: Plunkett comes into the scene. She tries to yell to the
text: animals to bo quiet. The noise is too much for her. Oliver
text: tries to explain to Miss Plunkett that he wants to exchange
text: the kitten, which he holds in the box in his hands, for a
text: canary, but he cannot make himself heard. She only shakes
text: her head and tries to say something at which Oliver shakes
text: his head. Irena touches Oliver's arm, indicating that it
text: might bo better to go outside. Oliver points outdoors to
text: Miss Plunkett. She nods and follows them out onto the
dialog: street.
scene_heading: EXT. PET STORE - DAY
text: MED. SHOT. The three emerge from the store, Miss Plunkett
text: closing the door behind her. All three stand under the
text: umbrella. In the loud, shrieking voice she has been using,
text: Miss Plunkett starts to speak.
speaker_heading: MISS PLUNKETT
dialog: I can't imagine...
text: She realizes she doesn't have to talk so loudly now, and,
text: with an embarrassed laugh, begins again in her natural voice.
speaker_heading: MISS PLUNKETT (cont'd)
dialog: Landie, dearie me! I can't
dialog: imagine what got into them... all
dialog: that caterwauling. The last time
dialog: they did that was when an alley
dialog: cat got in and ate up one of my
dialog: nice rice finches.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: All I want is to exchange this
dialog: kitten for a bird.
speaker_heading: MISS PLUNKETT
dialog: Why, of course. I have some lovely

speaker_heading: MISS PLUNKETT
dialog: Animals are ever so psychic. There

dialog: girl...I've nothing against
dialog: her...but you should just see what
text: happens when she puts her foot
dialog: inside this place.
dialog: The cats particularly. They seem to

dialog: landie, dearie me, you can't fool a
dialog: cat. In some ways they seem to know
dialog: who's not right â if you know what
dialog: I mean.
dialog: (she has the bird in her
text: hand and holds it up
dialog: with pleasure)
dialog: Here we are! Isn't he a ducky
dialog: little angel!
text: Oliver takes the bird and holds it up for Irena to see.

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: This is it.
scene_heading: EXT. PET STORE - DAY
text: MED. SHOT of Irena. The little bell tinkles over the door as

text: comes over to Irena. She exchanges the umbrella for the bird
dialog: cage.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (giving her the cage)
dialog: What do you think of it?

speaker_heading: IRENA

dialog: He will like me very much. You

speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: INT. DRAFTING OFFICE - DAY
text: MED. SHOT. In the b.g. the ship plans on the wall can be

text: Obviously some time has elapsed.
text: Oliver and Alice are sitting back to back, both of them doing
text: particularly exacting pieces of mathematical measuring.
dialog: Oliver raises up to call out:
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Slide rule.
text: Alice makes no motion. He turns to her more definitely,
text: calling out again, louder this time:
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: Let me borrow your slide rule, will
dialog: you?
text: But Alice is in the midst of a difficult problem, and she
text: goes on with it. Oliver turns around to her, places one arm
text: around her, and whispers in her ear after the fashion of
dialog: Charles Boyer.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: Mademoiselle, you are so beautiful
dialog: - so charming. So gracious a lady
dialog: will surely pass me her slide rule,
dialog: no?
text: Alice succumbs. She looks up at him and gives him the slide
text: rule. Then she gulps.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: I have to wash the taste of that
dialog: out of my mouth.
text: She goes over to the water cooler. Oliver follows her,
text: Alice looks up to see Jim Carver approaching.
speaker_heading: ALICE (cont'd)
dialog: Look who's coming.
text: Oliver winks at her, Jim reaches the two at the water
text: cooler. Alice has a paper cup full of water in one hand.
text: She takes out a coin with the other hand.
speaker_heading: ALICE (cont'd)
dialog: Doc, I'll bet there's one thing you
dialog: can't do..
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (demonstrating with belt
dialog: on her dress)
dialog: I'll bet you a dollar you can't
dialog: hold a quarter on your forehead
dialog: like this, pull out your belt,
dialog: lower your head, and let the
dialog: quarter fall bingo into your
dialog: trousers.
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: (taking the quarter;
dialog: with confidence)
dialog: A mere matter of precision.
text: He balances the quarter on his forehead, throwing his head
text: back to do so. He holds out the front of his trousers. Oliver
text: takes a box of paper clips from a near-by desk and empties
text: them into Carver's trousers. They all laugh. Carver laughs
text: with them. At this moment the Commodore comes down from the
text: mezzanine. There is instant silence.
speaker_heading: COMMODORE
dialog: Who wants to go out on my boat
dialog: Sunday?
text: Everyone ad libs enthusiastic acceptance except Oliver.
text: Carver, forgetting the paper clips, joins in and moves a
text: little more than he should; a deluge of clips falls around
text: his ankles. The Commodore looks at him, then back to
dialog: Oliver.
speaker_heading: COMMODORE (cont'd)
dialog: Don't you want to go, Ollie?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: The fact is, sir, I've got an
dialog: engagement for Sunday.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Your boat seems to have
dialog: competition, Commodore.
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: You should meet the competition.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Have you met her, Doc?
speaker_heading: CARVER
dialog: I saw her one day with Ollie.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (looking at Oliver)
dialog: Ollie's always saying he'll take me
text: to see her, but he never does.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: As a matter of fact, Alice, I was
dialog: going to take you around next
dialog: Sunday, but since the Commodore...
speaker_heading: COMMODORE (QUICKLY)
dialog: I withdraw my invitation to you
dialog: two.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: We'll take a rain check, Commodore,
dialog: (looks at Oliver)
speaker_heading: COMMODORE
dialog: (turning to go)
dialog: I'll expect the rest of you.
text: He starts toward the door. Carver moves to get out of his
text: way. There is a veritable deluge of clips. The Commodore

speaker_heading: COMMODORE (cont'd)

scene_heading: INT. IRENA'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: Alice, Irena, and Oliver are walking Into the room. It is
text: obvious that Alice and Oliver have just arrived and been met

dialog: Alice's.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: I think, Alice, I shall like you
dialog: very much. We shall be good
dialog: friends, you and I.
text: Alice is a little embarrassed by Irena's warmth of manner.
text: She looks about the apartment.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Ollie tells me you like to draw
dialog: cats. I tried to draw a cat once --
text: looked more like a mouse.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Cats are harder to draw than the
dialog: human hand...a good cat portrait is
dialog: almost impossible. Look up
dialog: there...
dialog: (pointing to the mantel
dialog: picture)
dialog: Even Goya couldn't do it...not
dialog: really well. That's why I like
dialog: It...because it's hard.'
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (with a laugh)
dialog: Because it's hard? You're a glutton
dialog: for punishment.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: No, it's not just because it's
dialog: hard. In a way, I felt I had to
dialog: draw them. Didn't you draw
dialog: boats?
speaker_heading: ALICE (NODDING)
dialog: Sure. I spent half my study periods
text: drawing boats. The Marblehead
dialog: tomboy â that was me.. My poor
dialog: mother wept every time I brought
text: home a report card.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: And I drew cats. The other children
dialog: in my village had cats, and they
dialog: could hug them and play with them.
dialog: But cats don't like me. They won't
dialog: let me cuddle or caress them. So
dialog: instead of playing with them, I
dialog: drew them. They're the one subject
dialog: still too hard for me. You
dialog: understand, don't you?
text: Without waiting for an answer, she rises and picks up a sheaf
text: of drawings from nor desk. She spreads them out before
dialog: Alice.
speaker_heading: IRENA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: Look, Fashion drawings bore mo.
dialog: The only way I can do them is this
dialog: way.
text: Alice picks up one of the drawings and looks at it,
speaker_heading: IRENA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: Of course, when I got the gown the
dialog: way I want it, I rub out the cat's
text: face and sketch in a regular face.
text: Alice nods and puts the drawing back with the others. Oliver,
text: looking at Alice, is afraid that she has not been
text: sufficiently Impressed. He feels called upon to defend
dialog: Irena's work and to change the subject.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I think it's right clever. How
dialog: about my mixing a cocktail?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: I have them all mixed.
text: She hurries off behind the screen. Alice looks up at
text: Oliver, He is beaming with pride. She smiles at him,
text: holding up her finger, ring-joined, in a little gesture of
text: silent approval. The canary beings to sing. Alice rises
text: and goes over to the canary's cage. Oliver joins her beside
dialog: the cage.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: This is what the kitten turned
dialog: into.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Much easier for a working girl to
dialog: keep.
dialog: (as the bird hits an
dialog: especially high note)
dialog: Listen to her, will you? Little old
dialog: Jenny Lind herself.
text: The bird suddenly stops singing. Alice and Oliver look at
dialog: one another.
speaker_heading: IRENA'S VOICE
dialog: (coming over scene)
dialog: Was the bird singing?
dialog: They turn.
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: Yes. It gave out with an aria.
text: Irena comes toward them. She holds a small tray upon which
text: is a martini whirler, three glasses, and a small plateful of
text: hors d'oeuvres. She places the cocktail things upon a small
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: It's never sung before. This is
dialog: the first time.
text: She comes up to the cage, trying to coax the bird into song
text: with little cooing and whistling noises. The bird mopes on
text: its perch as far away from her as the cage will allow.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: The naughty bird. For me he will
dialog: never sing.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Probably a prima donna.
text: Turning toward the coffee table, Irena speaks suddenly, as if
dialog: with a desire to change the subject.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Shall we have our martinis?
text: Oliver bends down, gets the glasses, and hands them around.
text: Just as they lift their glasses, the eerie scream of the
text: panther sounds. Oliver and Alice look up.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: It's the panther --
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (lifting his glass)
dialog: Here's luck to all of us...May we

text: CAMERA DRAWS BACK to Include CLOSE SHOT of Irena near the
text: phonograph as she turns down the music so that it Is only
text: background music. She is wearing an attractive hostess gown.
text: She goes over to the sofa where Oliver is stretched out and
text: sits beside him. Irena's fingers begin to stroke his brows
text: regularly. She smiles down at him.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Better now?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Much better. Those under-lit
dialog: tables we work at...we had to use
dialog: them all day today... they give a
dialog: man a rotten headache.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: What about Alice? Doesn't she mind
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I suppose so, but she never lets
dialog: anything bother her. She says the
dialog: best cure for anything is swimming.
text: (his voice begins to get
dialog: sleepy)
dialog: She only lives at that women's club
dialog: because there's a pool there.
text: Irena continues to caress his brow. His head sinks down into
text: the pillows. He closes his eyes. An outside sound distracts
text: Irena, and she looks up.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the window from Irena's viewpoint. It has
text: begun to rain, and a blast of wind has spangled the window
text: with raindrops.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Irena as she smiles contentedly and looks down
text: at Oliver. He has fallen asleep and is breathing easily. He
text: moves gently, and one hand extends over the edge of the sofa.
text: Irena lets herself slide from the sofa to the floor. She
text: nestles against the sofa, cuddles her cheek against the back
text: of Oliver's outstretched hand, and rubs her face back and
text: forth, almost like a cat that pets itself against its

scene_heading: INT. IRENA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: Irena
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: IRENA

speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: I was watching you.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: And that was fun?
text: Irena makes a little purring murmur of assent. There is a

speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: Do you love me, Irena?

speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: I thought so. And you know that I
dialog: love you, don't you?

speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: I've never kissed you.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: You know, that's funny,
text: Irena withdraws gently from him and moves back a bit into
text: the shadows away from him.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: When people in America know each
dialog: other as well as we do â when
dialog: they're in love â or oven think
dialog: they're in love, they've usually
dialog: kissed long ago.
text: Irena slips further away from him into the shadows. He leans
text: toward her.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: Well...?
text: He can see only the dim outline of her shoulders, the white
text: blur of her face.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (suddenly taut,
text: anguished, as if the
dialog: words were being pulled
dialog: from her throat)
dialog: I love you, Oliver.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
text: (sitting up, alarmed by
dialog: her intensity)
dialog: For heaven's sake, Irena, what's
dialog: wrong?
text: Without answering, Irena suddenly lays her cheek against his
text: knee and beings to sob. Perplexed, Oliver looks down at her
text: and puts a hand on her head. She turns her head but does not
text: look at him. Her voice has a wild, strained quality, echoing
text: some strange agony.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: I've lived in dread of this moment,
dialog: Oliver. I've not wanted to love
dialog: you. I kept myself away from
dialog: people...I stayed alone...I never
dialog: wanted this to happen.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: But you just told me you loved me.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: I do. I do.
text: Oliver puts his hands under her elbows and tries to draw her

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Then there's only one thing to do.
dialog: Come up here and be kissed.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (withdrawing from his
dialog: hands)
dialog: No. I can't, Oliver, I've fled
dialog: from the past, from things
dialog: you could never know or
dialog: understand...evil things...
dialog: evil...
text: She breaks out again, sobbing. He looks down at her, worried.
text: Her sobs lessen, and Oliver begins to speak very quietly,
text: very calmly.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Irena, you've told me something
dialog: of the past...of King John, and
dialog: the witches in the village, and
dialog: the cat people who are descended
dialog: from them. Fairy tales, Irena,
dialog: fairy tales you heard in
dialog: childhood...nothing more than
dialog: that. They've nothing to do with
dialog: you, really.
dialog: You're Irena...you're here In
dialog: America...you're so normal you're
dialog: even in love with me...Oliver
dialog: Reed...a good, plain Americano.

speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: Yes, you're so normal that you're

dialog: bars.
text: CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show Irena at her desk. She has just
text: finished working on a sketch. Now she gets up, stretching
text: and turning. Her eyes fall on the bird in its cage, and she
text: crosses over to it, the CAMERA MOVING with her. The bird
text: huddles on its perch, frightened, Irena tries to encourage it
text: to sing. She whistles a few notes. Still no response. She
text: opens the small door of the cage, and puts her hand inside to
text: take hold of the canary. The bird flutters wildly. Before
text: she can get hold of it, it falls to the cage floor and lies
text: there. Irena picks it up tenderly and holds it in her hands.
text: The bird is dead. Irena is serious and concerned as she puts
text: the bird down on a table, opens a drawer, and takes out an
text: empty bonbon box. Very carefully she places the dead bird in
text: the box, and ties it up with a bit of ribbon. She puts on

text: A policeman has rounded a corner of the path, and is coming

dialog: if under the compulsion of some thought or desire outside
text: herself, she hurriedly takes the box, tears off the lid, and
text: throws the dead body of the canary into the cage.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the panther, as daintily, with little paw pats,

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It died.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: It died of fright when I tried to
dialog: take it In my hand.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: All right. The bird was afraid of
dialog: you -- that's nothing. I had a

dialog: grew up to be quite a nice fellow.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Oliver, when I went past the

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I've tried to make you realize all

text: Irena half turns. The statuette of King John is on the table

speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: Not that sort of help. There's

text: the darkness comes a male voice, a very persuasive, insistent
dialog: voice.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: the cats...the cats...you were

speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (eyes still closed as

dialog: walk in the day, and the tread of
text: their foot whispers in my brain.
dialog: I have no peace...for they are in
dialog: me...
text: She pauses, and a little grimace of pain goes over her
text: features. From her closed eyes two tears course slowly down
text: her cheeks. From the darkness the voice continues to urge
dialog: her on.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: In me... in me...
text: There is no response. The man gets up, so that we see him in
text: silhouette. He crosses the room and draws the curtains,
text: letting in the brilliant sunlight. Irena lies with eyes
text: closed, breathing with the shallow, regular breath of sleep,
text: undisturbed by the harsh light.
text: TWO SHOT of Irena and Dr. Louis Judd. He stands for a moment
text: watching her. Judd is a harshly ugly man of early middle
text: ago. There is an arrogance in his bearing which makes some
text: women see him as the suave, continental man, perfectly sure
text: of his success with any woman. His consulting room is clean,
text: antiseptic, and sparsely furnished with a couch, a chair, and
text: a gooseneck lamp on a stand. Irena is lying on the couch.
text: Judd, standing beside her, makes a few notations on a pad.
text: Then he lightly pats her cheek to wake her. She comes from
dialog: sleep very quietly.
speaker_heading: JUDD (cont'd)
dialog: You are very tired.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (smiling uncertainly)
dialog: No...not very.

dialog: her)
dialog: It's only that I remember nothing.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: But It 1s my duty to remember,
dialog: (patting the notebook in his hand)
dialog: I have it all here. Most
dialog: Interesting. You told me of your
dialog: village, and the people, and
dialog: their strange beliefs.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (anxiously)
dialog: Is that all I told you?
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: You told me tales of blood,
text: violence...mangled bodies in dark
dialog: forests...men torn to death by
dialog: woman half witch, half panther.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: I am so ashamed. It must seem so
text: childish.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: And the cat woman of your
dialog: village...you told me of them,
dialog: too...woman who In jealousy or
dialog: anger, or out of their own
dialog: corrupt passions, could change
text: into great cats, like panthers.
dialog: And if one of those woman were to
dialog: fall in love...and if her lover
dialog: were to kiss her...take her into
dialog: his embrace, she would be driven
text: by her own evil to kill him.
speaker_heading: JUDD (cont'd)
dialog: (pausing, coming closer
dialog: to her)
dialog: That's what you believe and what
dialog: you fear, isn't it?
text: Irena nods her head but does not raise her eyes.
speaker_heading: JUDD (cont'd)
dialog: Frankly, there is no need to be
dialog: ashamed. This is only what we call
dialog: a psychological block...a thing
dialog: which stands between you and what
dialog: you really desire.
text: Irena looks at him. He looks at his watch, crosses to the
text: desk and puts away his notebook with an air of finality.
speaker_heading: JUDD (cont'd)
dialog: Those things are very simple to
dialog: psychiatrists. You told me of your
dialog: childhood. Perhaps we'll find this
dialog: trouble stems from some early
dialog: experience. You said you didn't
dialog: know your father...that he had died
dialog: in some mysterious accident in the
dialog: forest before your birth...and
dialog: because of that the children teased
dialog: you and called your mother a
dialog: witch...a cat woman. These
dialog: childhood tragedies are inclined to
dialog: corrode the soul, to leave a canker
dialog: in the mind, but we will try to
dialog: repair the damage.

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Sorry. I seem to have put my big

dialog: drew aside from her. As for the
dialog: children who teased you...who would
dialog: explain his absence to them?
dialog: Naturally, they could only go by
dialog: old wives' tales of cat women and
dialog: violence,

dialog: at Irena)
dialog: I'm right, am I not?
text: Irena pauses thoughtfully for a moment.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: But what of my mother's death?
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: Her death? You didn't tell me.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (still quietly)
dialog: I held her hand when she died. That
dialog: hand...even as I held it... turned
dialog: to the black paw of a panther. I
dialog: felt the coarse hair, the sharp
dialog: talons, the pads...I felt them... I
dialog: saw her lying, black... I saw that.
text: She pauses and looks at Judd, who is frowning at her; she
text: speaks, almost with a note of triumph,
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: What little pastoral, Doctor... do
dialog: you have to explain that?
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: You were a child?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: I was thirteen when my mother died.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: Why did she die?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: There was an epidemic in the
dialog: village.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: And you were sick, feverish,
dialog: delirious, when your mother died?
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: No. I was called from school. I
dialog: can remember it so clearly. I came
text: through the fields. The meadow
text: larks were singing, and the sun was
dialog: shining. I carried the knapsack of
dialog: school books in my hand. I
dialog: remember I could not believe that
dialog: on such a day anyone could die. I
dialog: was not delirious.
speaker_heading: JUDD
text: There is a delirium in great
dialog: grief. There are the illusions of
dialog: bereavement.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: The priest would not come into our
dialog: house when he saw what was on the
dialog: bed. Was his also an illusion of
dialog: grief?
text: Dr. Judd has no answer to make for a moment. He flicks a leaf
text: from the path with his cane, then smiles at her.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: There is always an explanation for
dialog: every phenomenon. We shall find the
dialog: reasonable explanation for this
dialog: one.

text: TWO SHOT of Oliver and Alice. They are at a plotting table,
text: Oliver is holding a slide rule in his hand, and is calling
text: out numbers as she moves the batten. He looks at the number
text: on the hairline, and calls It off to Alice.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
text: Toward the sheer line...sixty-two
dialog: degrees --
text: Alice moves the batten with which she is plotting the curve
text: of a bulkhead to the measurement Oliver has given her. It
text: takes a sharp, awkward bend. She looks up at Oliver and
text: points at the batten.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Hey!
text: Oliver looks at the batten, grins ruefully and apologizes!
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I'm sorry. Must have given you the
dialog: wrong figure. Let me try again.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (coming round the table to
dialog: him)
dialog: Wait. Let's have a cigarette
dialog: first.
text: They go toward the water cooler, as he fishes through his
text: pockets for a package of cigarettes. Alice takes a cigarette,
text: taps it on her nail, and smiles at him.
speaker_heading: ALICE (cont'd)
dialog: That's the third wrong figure
dialog: you've given me this morning.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Getting careless in my old ago.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Something's on your mind. Anything
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: No.
text: They have reached the water cooler. She lights her
text: cigarette, and accepts the cup of water he hands to her. He
text: draws another cup for himself. She grins at him, as she
text: waves away the first strong puff of smoke from her cigarette.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: Must be marriage.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: In a way, it is. I'm worried about
dialog: Irena.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I thought she was going to Dr.
dialog: Judd.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: That's what I thought. But I
dialog: bumped Into Judd this morning,
dialog: and she hasn't been there since
dialog: the first visit.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: But you told me she seemed anxious
dialog: to be cured.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Apparently not.
text: Alice crumples up the paper cup and drops It into the waste
dialog: basket.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I'm sorry, Oliver. It must make you
dialog: very unhappy.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (thoughtfully, simply)
dialog: You know...it's a funny thing...
dialog: I've never been unhappy before.
dialog: Things have always gone swell for
dialog: me. I had a grand time as a
dialog: kid...lots of fun at school... at
dialog: the office here with you, and the
dialog: Commodore, and Doc. That's why I
dialog: don't know what to do about all
dialog: this. I've just never been unhappy.
text: Alice looks at him. Suddenly she begins to cry. Oliver looks
text: at her in astonishment, takes a quick glance to see that the
text: other workers in the office have not noticed, and quickly
text: leads her around behind the filing cabinets.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: (drawing out the word)
dialog: Hey --
dialog: (pulling out his
dialog: handkerchief)
dialog: Wait a minute!
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (blowing her nose)
dialog: I can't help it. I just can't help
dialog: it.
dialog: (looking up at him)
dialog: I can't bear to see you unhappy. I
dialog: love you too darn much, and I don't
dialog: care if you do know it. I love you.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: I didn't' know it.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Of course, you didn't. What do you
dialog: think I'd do...drag my blooding
text: heart across the drafting tables?
dialog: It just had to come out now. It's
dialog: been too hard to love you...to see
dialog: you in love with Irena...and to
dialog: see you unhappy.
text: They stand looking at each other. Alice gives a final blow
text: to her nose, hands the handkerchief back to Oliver, and
text: manages a grin.
speaker_heading: ALICE (cont'd)
dialog: Forgot it. There's Irena... you're
text: in love with her.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: I don't know. All this trouble has
dialog: made me think -- I don't know what
dialog: love really is. I don't oven know
dialog: whether I'm in love with Irena.
text: Alice looks at him very thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (simply, sincerely)
dialog: I know what love is. It's
dialog: understanding. It's you and
dialog: me...and let the rest of the world
dialog: go by. It's just the two of us,
dialog: living our lives
dialog: together..happily...proudly. No
dialog: self-torture...no doubt. It's
dialog: enduring and it's everlasting.
dialog: Nothing can change it. Nothing can
dialog: change us. That's what I think
dialog: love is.
text: Oliver looks over at the water bubbles rising in the cooler.
text: He looks intently at them, almost as if counting them as they
text: rise, burbling to the surface. He speaks without looking at
text: Alice, his eyes on the bubbles rising in the water cooler.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I don't feel that way about Irena.
dialog: It's a different feeling. I'm
text: drawn to her. There's a warmth from
dialog: her that pulls at me...I have to
dialog: watch her when she's in the room. I
text: have to touch her when she's near.
dialog: But I don't really know her. In
dialog: many ways were strangers.
text: He turns and looks at Alice. She reaches out and takes his
text: hand. They stand together like two people on a street corner
text: shaking hands.
speaker_heading: ALICE (SIMPLY)
dialog: You and I...we'11 never be
dialog: strangers.
text: He smiles at her and she returns his smile.

scene_heading: INT. IRENA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Irena is in the window alcove, busily engaged in washing her
text: paint brushes. She twirls them between her palms to get the
text: water out of them. Oliver is in his easy chair. He holds a
text: magazine in his hands, but he is not reading. Suddenly he
text: puts the magazine down.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Irena.
text: Irena turns toward him, but continues to twirl the brush
text: she has In her hands.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: (rising and coming
dialog: toward her)
dialog: Irena, I'm worried. What's
dialog: happening to us?
text: Irena looks up at him as she stops twirling her brush. She
dialog: speaks very simply, as if this explained and adjusted all
dialog: difficulties.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: I love you, Oliver.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I know -- but people can love,
text: and people can still drift apart.
dialog: And that's what I feel is happening
dialog: to us. We don't talk together
dialog: openly â you are not frank with
dialog: me...
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I have never lied to you.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I ran into Dr. Judd today.
text: Irena looks at him and then down at the brush in her hand.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: You haven't been back to see him.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: He cannot help me.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You won't lot him help you. You
dialog: won't let me help you. You won't
dialog: even help yourself. It's what I
dialog: said to Alice this afternoon â
text: At the mention of Alice, Irena has repeated the name softly,
text: furiously, the while a look of concentrated fury has come to
text: her face. The rest of Oliver's speech has been lost to her
text: through her own anger.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: You're content to go on as we
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: IRENA
text: (softly, but savagely sibilant)
dialog: Alice!
text: Oliver looks at her. He sees her anger, realizes that she is
text: just about to burst forth savagely. He makes a gesture of
dialog: resignation.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (restraining himself)
dialog: I promised you we'd never quarrel.
dialog: Let's calm down a bit.
dialog: (starts toward the door)
dialog: I'll go down to the office â I've
dialog: got some work to do.
text: At the door he picks up his hat and coat and goes out,
text: closing the door quietly behind him. No sooner has the door
text: closed than Irena jumps to her feet, paces quickly toward
text: it, then back again.
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Oliver comes up in front of the office building that houses
dialog: the Consolidated Ship and Barge Construction Company. A
text: plaque on an entrance cornerstone bears the name of the
text: company. There has been snow, followed by thaw, so that the
text: streets are wet. Oliver stands on the wet street, watching
text: the revolving door slowly move around with abrupt jerks. No
text: one, however, is in any of the door compartments. Then as
text: the door comes around, we see that in one of the
text: compartments, on her hands and knees, scrubbing the floor, is
text: a thin charwoman, Mrs. Agnew, her blowsy hair falling down
text: over her face. As she gets around in front of Oliver, she
text: looks up, brushing the hair out of her eyes. A lighted
text: cigarette, with a long ash dangles from one corner of her
text: mouth. She picks up her bucket and scrubbing brush and
text: starts to move out of Oliver's way.
speaker_heading: MRS. AGNEW
dialog: You want to go up to the office,
dialog: Mr. Reed?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: No, I think I'll go around the
dialog: corner to Sally Lunn's and get a
dialog: cup of coffee before I got to work.
dialog: (starting off down the
dialog: street)
dialog: I'll be back.
text: Mrs. Agnew nods. The long ash of her cigarette falls down the
text: front of her dress. She brushes off the ashes with ladylike
text: strokes, as if it were a usual occurrence,
scene_heading: INT. SALLY LUNN'S TEAROOM - NIGHT
text: Oliver comes into the tearoom. It is a typical quaint
text: tearoom of the type seen in Manhattan side streets. A Negro
text: waitress, Minnie, dressed in a stylized soubrette costume
dialog: (something like the kind worn by the Brown Derby waitresses)
text: turns around as Oliver enters.
speaker_heading: MINNIE
text: (with a broad smile as he
dialog: sits down)
dialog: Maybe you'd like some nice chicken
dialog: gumbo, Mr. Reed.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: No, thanks, Minnie. How about some
dialog: apple pie and a cup of coffee?
speaker_heading: MINNIE
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Yes'r, Mr. Reed.

dialog: order)
dialog: My goodness, don't nobody like

scene_heading: INT. DRAFTING OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Alice is working alone late at night. She has just hung up
text: the last T-square on the back wall. Now she turns out the
text: light above her desk, leaving the room illuminated by a
text: single light near the door. On her under-lit drafting
text: table, taking full advantage of the warmth, his forepaws
text: snuggled under his chin, is the most decorous sort of
text: office cat. He looks like a bookkeeper. Alice is putting on
text: her hat when the telephone rings. She picks up the phone.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (Into phone)
dialog: Hello.
dialog: (no response)
dialog: Hello.
dialog: (still no response)
scene_heading: INT. IRENA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Irena has the telephone in her hand, and over the phone we
text: hear Alice's voice.
speaker_heading: ALICE'S VOICE
dialog: Hello -- Hello â
text: Irena quietly hangs up the phone.
scene_heading: INT. DRAFTING OFFICE - NIGHT
text: There is a faint click from the other end of the wire, as of
text: a receiver being put softly back onto the cradle. Alice,
text: disgusted, slams her own receiver into place.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (addressing the cat)
dialog: John Paul Jones, don't you hate
dialog: people who do that?
text: She grabs her coat and starts putting it on. She turns out
text: the last remaining light and starts to leave the office. At
text: the door she pauses and calls through to the cat.
speaker_heading: ALICE (cont'd)
dialog: Good night, John Paul.
dialog: (closes door)
scene_heading: EXT. A ROOFTOP OPPOSITE IRENA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Along the rooftop of the building opposite Irena's apartment
text: glide a couple of mangy alley oats. They lead into the
text: scene. Seeing Irena's lighted window, they seat themselves on
text: the parapet side and look down into the lighted square of the
text: window. Through it Irena can be seen on her knees, her hands
text: folded in prayer. Her lips are moving.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING
text: :fI*bm^;:VohlMv;th6?ae^h^1M'V/Â¦::,iV^ cat in line; a little
text: further to one side than the other. From this vantage point
text: we can see down into Irena's apartment. We now see the
text: object of Irena's adoration and her plea: the statue of
text: King John of Serbia. Suddenly, Irena rises swiftly to her
text: feet, and with a quick, violent movement she sweeps the
text: statue to the floor. The cats, frightened, scamper away
text: over the rooftops.
text: The CAMERA MOVES toward the window, as we see Irena catch up
text: her hat and coat and leave.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Alice comes out of the elevator. Mrs. Agnew is in the lobby
text: and has risen to a sitting position on her knees. She has

speaker_heading: MRS. AGNEW
dialog: Said he was going around the corner

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (starting off)
dialog: I'll see if I can catch him, Good

text: Alice enters the tearoom and stands beside Oliver. She

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Could you squeeze the coffee pot

dialog: You're very swell.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (lightly)

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: As SHOT through the plate glass window of the florist shop,
text: with a grouping of tiger lilies in the f.g. Irena stands in
text: an alcove-entrance, watching Oliver and Alice as they go by.
text: TWO SHOT - Oliver and Alice. Alice stops, shivers, and draws

dialog: Cold?
speaker_heading: ALICE

scene_heading: EXT. TRANSVERSE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: Alice and Oliver pause at the entrance to the transverse,
text: which stretches away from them, Its darkness punctuated with
text: pools of widely spaced street lights. Alice looks up the
text: street and turns to Oliver.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Don't you want me to walk you home?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I'm a big girl now, and I'm not
dialog: afraid.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well, good night.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Good night.
text: They shake hands. Oliver turns and starts off across the
text: street, Alice waves good night to him as he reaches the other
text: side; then she draws a deep breath of the cold, crisp night
text: air, and turning, starts toward the transverse walk.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK WALL - NIGHT
text: Irena steps out from the shadows around the park wall. She
text: draws up her fur collar over the lower part of her face and
text: turns toward the transverse walk. On the sound track the
text: music for "Berceuses du Chat" begins in an eerie, minor key.
scene_heading: EXT. TRANSVERSE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: Irena pauses at the entrance to the transverse. Ahead of her,
text: walking briskly about one hundred feet in advance is Alice.
text: There are no other pedestrians on the narrow transverse walk.
text: The street and sidewalk are glistening wet and reflect the
text: pools of light from the street lamps. The melting snow drips
text: down the stone walls. Irena turns into the transverse and
text: starts to walk after Alice.
scene_heading: EXT. TRANSVERSE. WALK - NIGHT
text: SHOT of Alice, as she walks along. On one side of her are the
text: high, rock walls of the transverse; on the other is the
dialog: street.
text: SHOT of Irena, as she, too, walks along.
text: MED. SHOT - street lamp on transverse. It throws a circular
text: pool of light, Alice emerges from the darkness, crosses the
text: area of light, and continues on into the darkness. The soft
text: click of her heels fades into the distance. Even as the sound
text: of her steps fades, the sound of Irena's steps comes into the
text: scene. Irena comes from the darkness, crosses the area of
text: light, and continues oh after Alice into the darkness.
text: CLOSEUP of Alice's feet as they walk along, the heels
text: clicking on the wet pavement.
text: CLOSEUP of Irena's feet as they walk along, her heels
text: likewise clicking on the pavement.
text: MED. SHOT of a lighted area, as Alice again walks through a
text: circle of light. She walks directly through and into the
text: darkness beyond, her footsteps clicking on the pavement. As
text: her footsteps fade, we would logically hear Irena's steps
text: coming onto the scene. But we do not. There is nothing, only
text: the sound of Alice's heels fading into the distance. The
text: music of the "Berceuses du Chat" rises and fades.
text: SHOT of Alice as she walks along, the CAMERA TRUCKING with
text: her. There is the sound of her feet on the pavement. She
text: stops in a pool of street light, frowning, sensing the
text: presence of something behind her. She glances over her
text: shoulder, then looks around. The music is growing louder.
text: LONG SHOT of the glistening wet transverse walk, as Alice
text: sees it -- a dark, deserted walk, fading off to a perspective
text: line. It is lighted by regularly spaced street lamps.
text: SHOT of Alice, as she peers more closely into the darkness.
text: She is troubled. The silence is ominous. She frowns
text: apprehensively, turns, and starts to walk on a little faster.
text: She turns her head slightly, but does not dare look behind
text: her. She increases her pace and walks very rapidly through
text: the next area of light and on into the darkness. The sound
text: of her own steps is loud, and she begins to run. She reaches
text: the next pool of light, stops stock still, panic-stricken,
text: afraid to move. Outside the circle of light is only blackness
text: and silence, Alice's frightened eyes poor into the darkness.
text: She shrinks against the lamp post. Sheer terror crosses her
text: face. Suddenly there is a roaring sound that fills the sound
text: track, completely drowning the loud music. A pattern of light
text: cuts across Alice's face. She throws up one arm, almost as if
text: to defend herself. There is a hissing, screeching sound.
text: SHOT of a transverse bus, as with a hiss of air brakes it
text: stops directly alongside Alice. She grasps the platform rail
text: to steady herself. The doors open.
dialog: BUS DRIVER Climb on, sister.
text: Alice steps up. A snarl sounds in the darkness, looks behind
text: her. Her eyes are carried upward.
text: The wet shrubbery at the top of wall stirs, settling, as if
text: something had only that moment passed through it.
text: Alice is looking back over her shoulder, fascinated by what
text: she has seen. She is standing just within the bus, but the
text: driver cannot close the door.

dialog: Are you ridin' with me, or

speaker_heading: BUS DRIVER
dialog: You look as if you'd seen a
dialog: ghost.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Did you see it?
text: The driver looks at her in amazement. Abashed, Alice drops
text: a coin in the box and moves on. The driver shakes his head
dialog: morosely, as if crazy women were the cause of all
text: misfortune in this world, and pulls the gear that operates
dialog: the door.
scene_heading: EXT. SHORE OF PARK LAKE - NIGHT
text: The waterfowl are nesting on the shallow, reed-fringed shores
text: of the lake. Their heads are tucked in under their wings.
text: Suddenly, one of the fowl, the leader, comes to life, and
text: starts to cluck.
text: CLOSE SHOT - the tall reeds swaying, moving unnaturally, as
text: If something wore stealing quietly behind them.
text: All the birds have wakened now, and silently are swimming out
text: to the safety of the deeper water in the middle of the lake.
scene_heading: EXT. ARCHED BRIDGE OVER BRIDLE PATH - PARK - NIGHT
text: A mounted policeman, in glistening raincoat and cape, sits
text: quietly on his horse. A cone of lamplight illuminates him.
text: Overhead, from the bridge, a dark shadow glides. There is the
text: deadened sound or padded paws on the stonework of the bridge.
text: The horse, sensing the presence and hearing the sound, rears
text: suddenly and plunges. The policeman struggles to rein in the
text: maddened animal.
text: The policeman gets the horse in hand, although it continues
text: to snort and start nervously. He bends down from the saddle
text: to pat the horse's lathered neck.

scene_heading: EXT. SHEEPFOLD - PARK - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. SHEEP CARETAKER'S HUT - PARK - NIGHT

text: The bodies of three more slain lambs lying on the earth, are

scene_heading: EXT. PARK ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: Irena is standing under a street lamp. She seems dazed and
text: bewildered. She is dabbing at her lips with her

text: chain armor with ragged grave cerements for cloak and tabard.
text: He is unearthly tall and, as he walks forward, it is as if a

text: horseback as King John of Serbia. The face under the crowned
text: helmet is in darkness. When he comes up close, this darkness
text: is divided and reveals the face of Dr. Judd. Suddenly, and
text: with a savage movement, this knightly figure draws his sword.
text: It comes flashing from the scabbard and instantly changes, to
text: an enormous Yale key on a ring. The key grows constantly
text: larger, blotting out everything else from the screen. Over

dialog: You are very clever and, perhaps
dialog: you enjoy this little game you are
dialog: having with me. But, in the end, I
dialog: will discover your secret.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: Dr. Judd, believe me...I beg you
dialog: to believe,me. I have no secrets.
dialog: I have told you everything. I
dialog: have not lied to you. I need your
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: I cannot help you when you refuse
dialog: to confide in me. But I can warn
dialog: you. These hallucinations approach
dialog: insanity â this nonsense about Miss
dialog: Moore- in the park and at the
dialog: swimming pool â it is a
dialog: deterioration of the mind â the
dialog: escape into fantasy â and it is
dialog: dangerous â
text: He leans forward and shakes his forefinger before her face.
speaker_heading: JUDD (cont'd)
dialog: At this moment I could go before n
dialog: board and have you put away for
dialog: observation.
text: (his voice drops to a
dialog: confidential tone)
dialog: You are that close to real
dialog: insanity.
text: For a moment they face each other, and frightened.
dialog: Irena is shaken
speaker_heading: JUDD (cont'd)
dialog: I cannot help you. You can only
dialog: help yourself. You keep going back
dialog: to the mad legends of your
dialog: birthplace. Forget them. You
dialog: surround yourself with cat objects
dialog: â pictures â get rid of them. Lead
dialog: a normal life.
text: He rises, puts his arm about her shoulder, and starts leading
text: her toward the door. At the door Irena looks up at him.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (Softly)
dialog: For the first time you have been
dialog: kind to me.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: It is because you interest me.
text: As Irena walks out, he stands at the door watching her.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: INT. IRENA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Oliver and Irena are sitting at a little table drawn up
text: before the fireplace. They have finished dinner. Only the
text: empty dessert plates and the empty demitasse cups remain. The
text: fire is burning bright, but low. Above the mantle is an empty
text: space. The Goya has been removed. Later, as the CAMERA
dialog: SHIFTS, we will notice that the Grandville drawings and the
text: panther screen have also been taken away. Oliver is looking
text: down at his empty coffee cup, lost in thought. Irena is
text: watching him.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Oliver?
text: Oliver does not look up.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: I've been to Dr. Judd.
text: Oliver looks up Irena looks first at him, then at the empty
text: space where the Goya had hung. He follows her gaze and
text: notices that it is no longer there. They look at each other.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: I am no longer afraid.
text: Oliver looks at her very thoughtfully; then he rises and
text: starts around the table toward her. She rises expectantly,
text: almost as if preparing herself for his kiss. She stands
text: smiling. A step away from her he stops.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Listen, Irena -- I had hoped -
dialog: things have changed.
text: Irena still smiles at him, but there is more inquiry than
text: invitation in her smile. Oliver finds the words he wants to
text: say and says them with blunt simplicity.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: I don't love you, Irena. I love
dialog: Alice. I've always loved her, but I
dialog: didn't know it. I had to learn
dialog: maybe through this marriage of ours
dialog: -- what love was. I didn't want to
dialog: tell you this. But now, you see, I
dialog: have to. It's too late.
text: CLOSEUP of Irena. Oliver's words.
text: She has tears in her eyes as she echoes
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Too late ---
dialog: Irena and Oliver.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It's no one's fault...neither
dialog: yours, nor mine. I'm sorry we've
dialog: caused each other unhappiness...
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (looking tip at him)
dialog: You gave me happiness.
text: She sinks down on the edge of the sofa. Oliver faces her. It
dialog: is obvious that he is trying to be very practical and matter
dialog: of-fact. He takes this attitude from a sense of kindness.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: There seems only one decent thing
dialog: for me to do -- I'll give you a
dialog: divorce. Believe me, it is better
dialog: this way.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Better? Better for whom?
text: (she pauses, averts her
dialog: face and then says
dialog: brokenly)
dialog: I am being loft alone.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Oliver. Her words have affected him greatly.
text: He tries to say something but Is struck by the futility of
dialog: anything he can say and does not speak. (Note to director:
dialog: If necessary to get over this thought, you might lot him
text: start and swallow the word "Irena" as if he were going to say
dialog: more.)
text: Irena. She looks at him. As she looks, her mood changes;
text: anger comes to her face and it is almost as if with this
text: flood of anger, her grasp on reality and sanity relaxed.
text: Although her voice lowers, it gains in intensity. (Note to
dialog: director: There are a great many "s" sounds in the following
dialog: speech and, if possible, they should be emphasized so that we
text: can almost hear the spitting of a cat in her voice. The words
text: between should be held in low key. The facial expression is
text: tense and presages the immobility of her face in the coming
dialog: scene with Judd.)
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: Speak. You can't speak --
dialog: there's nothing you can say.
dialog: There's only silence. But I
dialog: love silence â I love loneliness
dialog: -
text: Irena and Oliver. He kneels down beside her alarmed by
text: her tone and very concerned. Irena turns away from him
text: hiding her face In the back of the sofa. Her two hands
text: rest on the back, stiffly, claw-like.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: (in the same low voice but
text: growing more incoherent
dialog: as she goes on)
dialog: I don't care. I am not a woman. I
dialog: can feel fierce pleasures a woman
dialog: never knows.
text: She grows completely incoherent, pouring forth torrentially
text: the meaningless words.
speaker_heading: IRENA (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: In me --- they are in me ---
dialog: their warmth --â their strengthâ
dialog: their softness -- lonely â dark â
text: silent â silent.
text: Oliver bends close to her and shakes her shoulder.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Irena â you're talking, like an
dialog: insane woman.
text: Irena fights for self-control. We can see her fingers dig
text: deep into the upholstery. Then her voice comes, throaty and
text: vibrant with attempted control.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: Please --- please go.
text: Oliver looks at her, concerned, reluctant.
speaker_heading: IRENA (cont'd)
dialog: I want you to go â go â please,
dialog: go.
text: Oliver gets up hesitantly and goes toward the door. He looks
text: back, sees her tensely quiet on the sofa, picks up his hat
text: and coat, looks again, his face showing worry and concern.
text: Finally he leaves, closing the door softly behind him.
text: Irena's two hands rip downward, the nails slashing the thin
text: fabric of the sofa covering.
text: Oliver is dialing a number. There is a tense look of urgency
text: on his face. He gets a response.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Dr. Louis Judd, please.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: INT. SALLY LUNN'S TEAROOM - DAY
text: We open the scene with a CLOSE SHOT of the kitchen door as it
text: opens outward into the restaurant. It is held open for a
text: moment as Minnie, the waitress, gets her tray through. On the
text: back of the door, a placard reads:
text: PUSH THE CHICKEN GUMBO TODAY
dialog: Sally Lunn, Manager
text: Through this door Minnie comes, bearing a tray on which is a
text: piece of apple pie, a dish of Bavarian cream, another of
text: Roquefort cheese, and three cups of coffee.
text: CAMERA PANS with her as she proceeds across the restaurant
text: with mincing steps. She is followed by a large, sinuous black
text: cat. Minnie comes up to a booth in which Alice, Oliver and
text: Dr. Judd are seated.
speaker_heading: MINNIE
dialog: Bavarian cream?
text: Oliver indicates Alice's place.
speaker_heading: MINNIE (cont'd)
dialog: Roquefort?
text: Oliver indicates Dr. Judd.
speaker_heading: MINNIE (cont'd)
dialog: And you get the apple.
text: She serves the three cups of coffee and retires with the cat,
text: tail aloft and proudly waving, pacing behind her. Judd
text: resumes a conversation that has obviously been interrupted by
dialog: the waitress.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: I have pointed out two
dialog: alternatives, Mr. Reed. Either have
dialog: her put away for observation and
dialog: restraint or have your marriage
dialog: annulled.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: It's tough for Oliver either way,
dialog: Doctor.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: As a psychiatrist I should
dialog: recommend that you have her put
dialog: away.
text: He looks first into Oliver's face and then into Alice's.
speaker_heading: JUDD (cont'd)
dialog: As your friend, however, I have
dialog: much more reasonable advice to
dialog: offer. I think you should have your
dialog: marriage annulled. In this way you
dialog: are free of responsibility. You two
dialog: could marry.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: And if Irena is sent away?
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: The law is very explicit. One
dialog: cannot divorce an insane person.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: If she's not well, I am going to
dialog: take care of her.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (looking at Oliver)
dialog: It's the only right thing.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: As you will. I shall have the
dialog: commitment papers drawn up and

dialog: tonight at her apartment. Let's say
dialog: 6 o'clock?
text: Oliver and Alice nod agreement.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
scene_heading: INT. IRENA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The ormolu clock on the mantel indicates that it Is now 7:30.
text: It rings, the half hour. The apartment is as we first saw it;
text: all the pictures are back; the screen is up. Alice has just
text: taken a record off the phonograph. Now she puts on another
text: one. It is the Berceuse. Oliver stops the machine and takes
text: off the record with an apologetic smile.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Let's not play that.
dialog: (looking at his watch)
dialog: I don't think Irena's coming.
dialog: We've waited an hour and a half.
dialog: I don't think she Intends to

text: SHOT of Judd as he rises and picks up his coat, hat, and
dialog: gloves.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: Perhaps it Is useless to wait.
text: He looks at his walking stick.

speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: How stupid! I left my walking stick

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I'll get it for you.
speaker_heading: JUDD
dialog: (stopping Oliver)
dialog: No, no. It is my fault. Give me the

dialog: goes in.

scene_heading: INT. DRAFTING OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Alice and Oliver have turned on the light in the office.
text: Oliver is sitting down at the desk, a thoughtful look on his

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Don't worry, Ollie. It'll come out
dialog: all right. It must.

speaker_heading: ALICE (cont'd)

speaker_heading: ALICE (cont'd)
dialog: They hung up.
text: She puts the receiver back on the cradle and pushes the
text: phone aside. Suddenly she remembers another evening when
dialog: the telephone had rung..,
speaker_heading: ALICE (cont'd)
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: That's funny.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: It happened once before like
dialog: that. The telephone rang. I
dialog: answered. There was someone on
dialog: the other end of the line; I
text: could almost hear them listening.
dialog: And then there was a little
text: click, as they put up the
dialog: receiver. That was the night I
dialog: was followed on the transverse...

dialog: takes his sleeve)
dialog: Oliver...
speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: OLIVER

text: Oliver turns out the light, and together they start toward
text: the door, the CAMERA MOVING with them. Oliver turns out the
text: under-lit table lights. Halfway across the room Alice stops,
text: her fingers clenching in Oliver's sleeve. There is n soft,
text: metallic click as of a door closing. They look In the
dialog: direction of the sound.
text: SHOT of the door. It is closed.
text: TWO SHOT - Alice and Oliver.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (turning to him)

text: then he turns to look at Alice.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
text: It's locked.
text: Alice seizes his arm. In the darkness, to one side of them,
text: there Is a sound like a snarl. Instinctively Oliver and
text: Alice step backward, away from the sound in the dark.
text: The CAMERA MOVES with them. They bump into a desk, grope
dialog: their way around It.
text: From the darkness following them, there is a whisper of
text: light, padded feet â a delicate tick, tick of claws scraping
text: the floor. Alice bumps Into the glassy coldness of the water
text: cooler, gasps in fright, arid pushes it away from her. There
text: is a crash, the sound, of glass breaking, and then the
text: throaty gurgle of water spilling out onto the floor.
text: It is silent then. Alice and Oliver are creeping back down
text: between a row of filing cabinets. Now there comes again,
text: pursuing them, the whispering tread of soft paws. Alice and
text: Oliver are against the further wall now. Alice is pushed
text: behind Oliver, her back against the wall. Panic-stricken,
text: she begins to whimper with restrained hysteria. Her nerves
text: are cracking up. Oliver tightens his hold on her wrist. A
text: cold sweat breaks out on his forehead. He reaches in his
text: pocket, and pulls out a book of matches. He lights one.
text: It throws a faint glow around them. Shadows flicker across
text: their faces. Behind them the match light dimly reveals the
text: letters "Project No. 457." They peer into the darkness.
text: SHOT of the dark, shadowy room.
text: Alice is sobbing with fright, trying to restrain her fear, so
dialog: that the sobs, when they come, are the more terrifying to
text: hear. Oliver calls into the darkness.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: Irena...Irena...
dialog: (the match light begins
dialog: to flicker)
dialog: Irena...
text: The match light dies. He lights another and pushes the book

text: and in the eerie light, a shadow is thrown on the wall above
text: and to one side of him. He leans forward tensely. He speaks
text: with deep feeling, the name of God in tones of reverent
dialog: supplication.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (cont'd)
dialog: Irena...I beg you, leave us In

text: CLOSEUP of Irena. This is as immobile, as expressionless a

text: stairwell. It is followed by hideous noises, bestial
text: snarls and growls, the crash of overturned furniture. Alice
text: and Oliver look at each other; then they start running up
text: the stairs. As they reach the first landing, the sounds of
text: snarling and struggle grow louder. There comes one
text: piercing, human shriek of agony and then quick silence.
text: Again Oliver and Alice pause and look at each other, then
text: continue on up the stairs.
text: SHOT of the stairs a flight above Oliver and Alice. There is
text: a shadow on the stairs, moving, black, and stealthily agile.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY - IRENA'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: TWO SHOT - Oliver and Alice. They are running up the second
dialog: flight of stairs.
text: SHOT of the stairs above them. We can see the shadow now more
text: clearly. It is Irena. She is coming down the stairs. Her
text: fur coat is only half on. One arm is in the sleeve; the
text: other side of the wrap is draped about her shoulders, pulled
text: across her breast as if she were holding it to hide some
text: hurt. She sees Alice and Oliver below her and moves
text: stealthily back into the deeper shadows of the stairway.
text: Alice and Oliver are passing an angle of the stairway where
text: Irena stands. Neither of them sees her.
text: CLOSEUP of Irena as she watches them go by. Her eyes are on
dialog: Oliver.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE IRENA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Alice and Oliver come up the stairs. On the stairway, coming
text: down from another floor, are two old ladies in faded dressing
text: robes. Other tenants have congregated about the open door of
dialog: the apartment.
scene_heading: INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - IRENA'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Irena is on the first floor. She is looking up.
speaker_heading: IRENA
dialog: (calling softly)
dialog: Oliver!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE IRENA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: TWO SHOT - Alice and Oliver. Oliver does not hear his name
text: but sensing Irena's presence, he stops, hesitating.
scene_heading: FIRST OLD LADY'S VOICE
dialog: Mr. Reed! Oh, Mr. Reed!
text: Oliver turns in the direction of her voice.
scene_heading: INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - IRENA'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: SHOOTING DOWN the stairwell from the upper floor, we see
text: Irena make a gesture of farewell to Oliver and turn away
text: toward the street door.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE IRENA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Oliver and Alice join the two old ladies and go through, the
text: doorway of Irena's apartment.
scene_heading: INT. IRENA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: As Alice and Oliver step into the apartment, Alice gets one
text: look at the room and turns away. Oliver takes her in his
text: arms, trying to hide the room from her. Over the scene is the
text: sound of the phonograph record still revolving with a
text: monotonous, grinding sound.
text: REVERSE SHOT of the apartment as Alice and Oliver see it. The
text: room bears the signs of a terrific struggle. Furniture is
text: overturned, ornaments smashed, the draperies and pictures
text: torn down. Judd's body is hidden by a chair. Only his legs,
text: one pants leg torn, can be seen. O.S. is the sound of the
dialog: record revolving. '
text: The two old ladies push into the room. They seem quite
text: pleased at all the excitement.
speaker_heading: FIRST OLD LADY
dialog: (to Oliver)
dialog: You needn't worry, Mr. Reed, Sue
dialog: Ellen and I phoned the police
dialog: Just as soon as we heard the
dialog: racket.
text: Oliver speaks almost automatically as he starts to look in
dialog: the other rooms.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Thank you.
text: The second old lady stoops and starts to pick something
text: up. The first old lady stops her.
speaker_heading: FIRST OLD LADY
dialog: Sue-Ellen! You know better than
dialog: that. You're not supposed to
dialog: touch anything until the police
dialog: get here.
speaker_heading: SUE-ELLEN
dialog: But it's all blood.
text: She points down.
text: INSERT THE BROKEN SWORD CANE in Judd's hand.
text: BACK TO SCENE. Alice and Oliver have joined the two old
text: ladies and are looking down at the broken sword.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: We've got to help her.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (thoughtfully)
dialog: She never lied to us.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (taking his arm)
dialog: Come on.
text: They slip out of the room together.
scene_heading: EXT. IRENA'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Alice and Oliver come down the steps, and they start to run
text: through the foggy night.
scene_heading: EXT. ZOO PROMENADE - PARK - NIGHT
text: Irena starts down the promenade. A white ground fog lies
text: heavily upon the earth. She pauses for a moment.
scene_heading: EXT. PANTHER CAGE - PARK- NIGHT
text: Irena comes up to the cage of the black panther. The panther
text: rises and looks at her.
scene_heading: INT. PANTHER CAGE - PARK - NIGHT
text: REVERSE SHOT - as the panther in the f.g. looks out between
dialog: the bars at Irena.
scene_heading: EXT. PANTHER CAGE - PARK - NIGHT
text: Irena opens the gate, reaches in her purse and finds the key.
text: She goes up to the lock in the cage and fits the key in the
text: lock, turning it. She pauses a moment and then swings open
text: the cage door.
text: CLOSEUP of the panther, doorway.
text: It is crouched, in the open
text: REVERSE SHOT of Irena. She is standing facing the panther.
text: Her head is up; her arms hang at her side, her hands spread
text: out. Her eyes are wide open.
text: MED. SHOT of Irena and the panther. The beast snarls once and
text: leaps forward. With one sweep of a heavy paw the animal hurls
text: Irena to the ground. Free, he bounds off into the darkness.
text: CLOSE SHOT of Irena. There is a little smile on her lips. Her
text: coat has fallen back from a naked shoulder. A piece of the
text: broken blade of Judd's dagger protrudes from a bloodless
text: wound in the shoulder. A thin trickle of blood flows from the
text: corner of her mouth. She scrabbles with her fingers against
text: the hard pavement. Then her fingers relax. She is dead.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK WALL - NIGHT
text: The panther leaps up on the wall and pauses, then leaps,
text: down, bounding across the avenue.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - PARK - NIGHT
text: SHOT of a taxicab speeding along through the fog, with
text: headlights glaring. Suddenly there is a scream of brakes, an
text: impact, a startling scream. The cab pulls to a stop, almost
text: beside the avenue, and the driver gets out. A policeman joins
text: him. They start running back.
text: CLOSE SHOT of the dead panther of the policeman's flashlight.
dialog: We see it in the beam
scene_heading: EXT. PANTHER CAGE - PARK - NIGHT
text: Oliver and Alice come to a little space before the cage. They
text: see a black object lying on the pavement. Quietly and
text: cautiously they cross over to it. Oliver bends down to
text: examine it. Under Irena's fur coat is a black leopard's body,
text: the leg and paw in the same attitude her arm and hand had
text: taken, and the broken blade that had once protruded from
text: Irena's gleaming shoulder is now rooted in the black fur of
dialog: the panther.
text: Oliver looks up at Alice, then gets to his feet, takes her
text: arm, and they start to the walk. Some few foot away, they
text: turn back to look again at the body.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (softly )
dialog: Poor Irena.
text: They turn off and walk away, arm in arm. They are lost to
text: view in the foggy luminosity under a street lamp.
speaker_heading: THE END
