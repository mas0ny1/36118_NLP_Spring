dialog: Rats in the Basement
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: In the pitch darkness of an old shivery east coast cellar, the audience sits amongst SILENCE. Then... Rising from the THEATRE'S REAR SPEAKERS...faint tiny claws, many, moving as one, scuttle; seemingly in the roof of the THEATRE. CHEWING. SCRATCHING. TEARING.
text: An elderly woman, shrill and startling, calls out in the
dialog: dark.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: Willard!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There are rats in the basement!
text: The scuttling stops. Silence. Beat; another, then...a metal doorknob, distinctive to a classic antiquated house, CLACKS and echoes. O.S., A door slowly squeaks open.
text: From an upstairs room, a rhomboidal patch of light creeps across the TOP RIGHT OF FRAME. Within the light holds the hesitant shadow of an average sized man at the summit of a flight of stairs, descending into a cold, dark cellar.
text: O.S., a light switch FLIPS. A FLASH! An exaggerated POP! The light bulb blows in the f.g., a fuse-box CRACKLES, sprays tiny blue sparks, then returns to darkness.
text: The shadow FLIPS the light switch with anxious futility. The basement remains dark.
text: The shadow SIGHS, shrinks, before the man DESCENDS an OS set of stairs; the risers bare. The aged wood creaks. Eerie as Arriving at a landing, he enters frame. Remaining in silhouette, yet backlit by the light spilling into the cellar from the upper room. Although face obscured by darkness, his posture reflects a dread as he continues down the stairs.
text: Upon reaching the cement floor, CAMERA CREEPS BACK. The light is dim, yet enough to reveal a fuse-box beside wooden storage shelves lining the walls. With a hand against the stone wall as a guide in the darkness, the figure moves to the fuse-box.
text: Opening the fuse-box door releases residual snaking blue smoke. He twists the fuses; taps on them. Nothing. Closing the fuse-box, he notices the wires have been chewed.
text: With cautious loathing, the man blindly continues to the shelves and rummages through the supplies.
text: His hands find a shoe box labeled FUSES and begins sliding it off the shelf. Until...he petrifies. CAMERA SWEEPS into the shoebox lid REVEALING half a dozen tapered rat droppings.
text: Aghast, the figure quickly pulls his hands away, trembling in the gray light. He holds. Still shaking, the hands quickly remove a toilet plunger from a shelf. CAMERA FOLLOWS the improvised weapon as it RISES several shelves. Chewed holes replace the Quaker's eyes on a tube of oatmeal giving the
text: pilgrim's smile the appearance of a madman. The toilet plunger pokes around, discovering chewed holes in boxes of Jello and Jiffy-Pop. Even candles and canned food have been gnawed.
text: Tense, the plunger pulls away knocking items off the shelf. A reflective glint rolls INTO FRAME. The bulb end of a cheap flashlight is grabbed by the man and hurriedly lit.
text: As the small light flares...SCUTTLING. The man spins toward the SOUND...
speaker_heading: IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM
text: A glimpse, yet...an unmistakable glimpse...of several rat tails dashing through a hole in a mesh screen; disappearing beneath the house.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN on WILLARD STILES, 30's. Under-lit by the trembling flashlight, still in his short sleeve white collar shirt and cheap tie work clothes. CAMERA CONTINUES...MOVING CLOSE on his puppy like eyes; locked on the mesh screen across the room. CAMERA CONTINUES until these eyes FILL THE FRAME; these eyes...afraid.
scene_heading: INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE - NIGHT - CLOSE-2-SHOT
text: A line drawing of a mouse, ears and tail, sits in the center of a red circle and slash; in the chief of the d-CON herald.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Agonizes over a laminated placard chained to the store shelf.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - PLACARD
dialog: d-CON Guide to Rodent Control...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Sighs, reaches out and holds the guide...
scene_heading: WILLARD'S POV - d-CON GUIDE TO RODENT CONTROL
text: His finger searches through questions on the far right. "What type of rodents do you have?" "Mice", "Rats". "Where will product be used?" "High traffic areas (Kitchen, Family Room, etc.) "Low Traffic Areas (Attics, Garages, basements, etc...)
dialog: The finger pauses upon... "Do you want proof you caught the rodents?" *Yes, I want proof. *No, I do not want to see or come in contact with a dead mouse/rat."
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Perspiration beads on his forehead.
scene_heading: D-CON GUIDE TO RODENT CONTROL (FILLING THE FRAME)
dialog: Willard's trembling finger settles beneath... "No, I do not want to see or come in contact with a dead mouse/rat..."
text: The finger moves across the guide to the recommended d-CON product which is "Mouse-Prufe II".
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Searches the shelves with his eyes.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - DUANE READE SHELVES
text: CAMERA PASSES OVER several sickening options. A package of an electronic pest repeller illustrates spiders, moths and rats fleeing from concentric circles of ultra sound.
dialog: The Giant Destroyer is powdered sodium nitrate; "The Effective Gas Killer! Kills Gophers, Moles, Woodchucks, Rats, Skunks & Ground Squirrels!"
text: Zep Commerical offers "Pest Glue Traps"; squares of cardboard with dabs of adhesive. "Traps Crickets, Spiders, Scorpions, Cockroaches and Larger Pests!"
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Frustration increasing; rummaging the shelves. He holds...
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - STORE SHELVES
text: The store marker indicates the location of "Mouse Prufe II." The area, however, is empty. The store is sold out.
speaker_heading: WIDE OVERHEAD ANGLE
text: Bright fluorescent lights glare upon Willard standing before the pest control section; an aisle amongst several aisles. While he is motionless, other customers move amongst the aisles like lab rats in a maze...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - OLD BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - NIGHT
text: Dead LEAVES blow across a cracked sidewalk. A pair of worn wing-tip shoes enter frame. CAMERA FOLLOWS the shoes adjusting to reveal Willard proceeding along the way.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS Willard, passing nineteenth century brownstone houses. Several are under renovation; caged by scaffolding. Others are for sale, marked by high-end realtor signs.
text: CAMERA MOVES AHEAD OF WILLARD until pausing on a corroded bronze plaque marked "STILES". CAMERA PAUSES as Willard, carrying a Duane Reade bag, starts up the steps.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a three-story brownstone suggesting hints of a proud past, turned pathetically decrepit, dark, and sad. The first and second level windows are barred. High above, centered, sits a yellow stained glass Dormer window beneath a Mansard roof.
scene_heading: INT. WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The whistling wind GUSTS as Willard enters, holding a bag of large wood Victor rat traps. Several real estate agency business cards and solicitations are attached with rubber bands to the doorknob. Willard removes and tosses the calling cards atop a stack of mail atop a desk-table.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - TABLE
dialog: The new solicitations fall up several dozen previous offers.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT - EXTREMELY CLOSE
text: Metal coils strain as a thick copper bow is pulled back.
speaker_heading: A LOCKING BAR
text: Is placed over the bow and engaged on the curved portion of the bait pedal, dabbed with peanut butter. SUDDENLY! the locking bar slips out of place. The bow releases! SMACK!
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Drops the rat trap, clutching the knuckle of his index
text: finger. Faintly splattered with peanut butter, he sucks on his throbbing knuckle.
text: Angry, he picks up the trap intending to heave it against the wall. His eyes however, flash upwards; considerate of not waking someone in the house, upstairs.
text: Holding the trap, he takes a closer look. Pulling the bow, he feels the tension. Releasing it, he imagines the death blow. SNAP! He pulls back the bow; releasing it. SNAP!
text: Willard appears repulsed by the medieval device. And yet... He considers the power over another life which lies in his hands. He pulls back the bow; releases it. SNAP!
text: As he continues, hypnotized by the rat trap, CAMERA PULLS AWAY, as if to leave Willard alone in the cellar. SNAP! Several successfully set rat traps encircle him. He pulls back the bow; releases it. SNAP!
text: CAMERA NOW SHIFTS...PANNING. ACROSS THE CELLAR to the small hole in the wire mesh, leading beneath the house. Willard is not alone.
text: AS CAMERA PUSHES IN, THROUGH THE DARKNESS and HOWLING WIND OUTSIDE,.. two quarter-sized opalescent circles reflect light in a manner unique to animal eyes. OS, SNAP! The flashlight spill creates the illusion of mean, furrowed brows. Whiskers
dialog: extend six inches in each direction from the snout.
text: CAMERA CREEPS towards an enormous greasy eighteen inch black Norwegian rat; watching Willard.
dialog: This is BEN. SNAP!
dialog: Awful Mother, Awful Name
scene_heading: INT. PARLOR - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Two stuffed pheasant silhouettes frame the f.g., Positioned high upon a bookshelf, OS, a CLOCK peals. Across the dim room of dark wood, Willard appears and starts up a staircase.
text: The clock CHIMES. He checks his Timex wristwatch, then sighs with frustration. As he starts down the stairs, CAMERA MOVES RIGHT, as if along the wall; black figures of stuffed animals pass between Willard and CAMERA.
text: Reaching the fireplace mantle, CAMERA HOLDS as if settling upon the mantle. CAMERA is always a touch above eye level on Willard. Looming above him is an ornately handled funeral urn.
text: He checks his watch, reaches to the mantle, and resets the clock. After winding several revolutions, he wipes at the layers of dust, leading the urn. He freezes! Sad and pining.
speaker_heading: REVERSE - LOWER ANGLE
text: Like a fading omnipresent memory, a portrait of a pin
text: stripped suited captain of industry yet also a kindly father in his early fifties hangs above the urn in the dim light. An engraving identifies the urn as the ashes of "Alfred Benjamin Stiles. Loving husband and father. 1944-1995."
speaker_heading: RETURN - WILLARD - HIGHER ANGLE
text: CAMERA MATCHES THE MOVE on Willard's expression, lost in fond but pained memories of his father...
scene_heading: INT. 2ND STORY LANDING - HALLWAY - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Willard's shadow stretches across a wall as he moves up the stairs. Willard turns off the downstairs light and continues along the hallway. Outside, the cold WIND CONTINUES HOWLING.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: Willard.
text: Willard holds before a bedroom, door ajar. CAMERA CREEPS INTO HIM; eyes reluctantly turning toward the room.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - HIS MOTHER'S BEDROOM
text: A slash of autumn light cuts across a pair of elderly female eyes, reflecting an iridescent gray; eerie, like an animal. The encircling skin is pale. The lids, lined a dying pink.
text: Although at the core the woman's voice is a loving mother. The edges are shrill and nagging.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Holding in the hallway, dry and well mannered.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I'm going to bed.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: It's late!
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Yes. I'm going to bed. Good night, mother.
text: He begins moving off, then freezes upon...
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: What were you doing down there, so late?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You said there were rats.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: Did you see them?!
text: Pause. A smile spreads over Willard which his mother can read as reassuring, however, he's enjoying lying to her.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: There are no rats.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: There are!
dialog: (catches her breath)
dialog: All our neighbors moving away and all these new people remodeling the houses are stirring up rats.
text: The smile quickly fades.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Have you been to the basement?
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, you know I can't. But I know they're there. I smell them! All my life I could smell mice.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Smell mice.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: And hear them! Don't you hear them down there?!
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: It's just the wind. There are no rats.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: (a tubercular sigh)
dialog: Come in here.
text: CAMERA INCHES, AGAIN... CLOSE to Willard. His expression reflecting neither disgust or hate...just...reluctance.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: Come in here!
text: Willard CLEARS FRAME, moving toward his mother's bedroom...
scene_heading: INT. MRS. STILES' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Mrs. Stiles wears a mousy light brown fleece nightgown beneath a down comforter and still suffers chills. She is propped against pillows, three deep; the cases blotted with dried yellow and gray fluidal stains.
text: Willard enters and stands at her bedside. Although she takes his hand, his mother never looks at him while she talks; closing her eyes or busying herself, but never looking into his eyes and truly seeing him.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: I'm sorry I've been such a bad mother to you...
text: Willard moves to her with sincerity and warmth, carefully removing the pillows behind her and fluffing them.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You've been... You are...a wonderful mother.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: It's my fault your life was wasted.
text: Holding a pillow at each end, he is about to return it to its original position, yet the comment freezes him. For a beat...he's in a tempting position to suffocate her. Yet, he carefully eases her forward, places the pillow behind her, and gently returning his mother to a comfortable position.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: Willard...
text: Conflicted, unable to see her so ill and yet anxious to leave the room, he forces a warm smile, as if "yes, mother?"
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: What an awful name. Willard.
dialog: (sigh)
dialog: If you had a stronger name, Frank Martin wouldn't push you around.
text: Willard holds, hurt, aware his mother is not daffy or Alzheimer's demented, rather, unwittingly mean.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: Or maybe you'd've found a girlfriend if you'd had a more handsome name. Mark or Kyle.
dialog: Clark.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: From now on, Willard, you're name's Clark.
text: Mrs. Stiles settles back and closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: Good night, Clark.
text: As Willard holds in the darkness, stoic, yet wanting to cry...
scene_heading: INT. WILLARD'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: In a queen sized bed, natural shadows created by barred windows fall across Willard, awake. The wind has died. It is QUIET.
text: Then...from within the ceiling...a PIT-A-PAT is first HEARD in the REAR SPEAKERS Of the theatre. Claws scuttle. CLICK CLICK CLICK. Seemingly moving from rear to forward speakers, as if over the audience.
text: CAMERA CREEPS FORWARD, toward Willard, frozen with anxiety by the tiny scratching claws. As CAMERA REACHES Willard, a beat of silence. Then snap! O.S., in the basement, a rat trap is set off. SNAP! Another. SNAP! SNAP! SNAP!
text: As Willard slams his eyes shut.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - MORNING
text: CLICK! A flashlight beam cuts the darkness. Willard holds at the top of the landing. CAMERA SWEEPS UP the beam revealing Willard's baffled and distraught expression:
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - CELLAR
text: The dozen traps have all been tripped, however, every one is empty. There is not a dead rat in sight.
dialog: He Wants to See You
speaker_heading: EXT. FACTORY - DAY
text: An old brick and iron decorative arch extends over the walkway to a factory; designated "Martin-Stiles Iron Works." A sub-sign clarifies: "Industrial & Commercial Fences."
text: On the large sign, "Martin" has clearly been added in recent years and maintained, as has Manufacturing", while "Stiles" has been allowed to oxidize and drips green.
text: Late, Willard, with a hand-me-down leather accordion briefcase under his arm hustles beneath the archway. An old decorative iron fence frames the factory grounds.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - FACTORY - MORNING
text: Willard sighs with dread while checking his cheap watch. Approaching the factory office, he notes...
speaker_heading: A PARKING SPACE
text: A mid-nineties Cadillac is parked in the power spot. A sign on the brick wall declares: RESERVED - MR. MARTIN
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - ELEVATOR - MORNING
dialog: The building was erected during the first world war.
text: Perfunctory pastiche renovations have created a sampling of lifeless 20th Century office building decor.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS the patch of yellowing plastic fluorescent lights leading along a hallway of gray and red speckled linoleum floors and wood paneled walls.
text: The greasy elevator arrives. A metal door opens before a second wire mesh door can be opened. Willard hustles out and dashes into the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - MORNING
text: Willard passes through a doorway leading to a shared office with several gray metal desks. Cathryn responds to his awkward charm with a pained, yet sincere smile. She quickly assesses he is being bullied.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: Yeah. It seems no one told Mr. Stiles I would be here.
speaker_heading: MS. LEACH
dialog: (mocking him)
dialog: Well, Willard...maybe that's why he wants to see you.
text: Ms. Leach fires her thumb blindly over her shoulder toward a closed door. CAMERA INCHES IN on Willard tensing with intense dread and suppressed anger as his eyes flash toward...
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - THE CLOSED DOOR
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Well above his eye-line, nearly looking down on him, CAMERA LEADS WILLARD toward the door. Cathryn watches him, feeling somehow responsible for his call to the principal's office.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - OFFICE DOOR
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN... The name FRANK MARTIN growing larger. Willard's hand knocks. After a power pause...
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. MR. MARTIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: The door opens revealing FRANK MARTIN, early 60's, eyes down, working at a large desk placed in the power position. Cuff links, suspenders and televangelist hair, Mr. Martin believes he is the top of the pyramid. At a conference of true CEOs, however, he'd be avoided like the plague. An old economy, fold school, embarrassment.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Ventures an arm length into the room, clutching the doorknob, while awaiting acknowledgement.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Keeps working, making Willard hang...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Averts his eyes, then quietly attempts a retreat.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
dialog: Who's that at your desk, Willard?
text: Caught, Willard looks up.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
text: Eyes still on his work, gestures pointedly for Willard to take a seat in one of the leather chairs across his desk.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Willard moves like a condemned man trying to maintain a morsel of dignity. He sits. Martin maddeningly busies himself as a means of intimidation...
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Who's that at your desk, I said.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I...I don't know her.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: No? You're the reason she's here.
text: Increasingly flustered and angry, Willard can only manage to shake his head and shrug. Mr. Martin shakes his head in disgust, mocking his employee.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: You are at least a week behind processing the purchase orders. Aren't you?
text: Willard averts his eyes, ashamed and guilty.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: At least a week...
text: Martin stands, paces, raising his voice, eyes fiery. His
dialog: venom appears derived from more than tardy purchase orders.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: That means... My sales people. The guys out on the floor, inventory, shipping. EVERYTHING comes to a dead stop. Because you allowed purchase orders to bottleneck on your desk.
text: Willard appears driven to the brink of tears. He would never let them fall in front of Mr. Martin. He takes his beating.
text: Martin studies him, yet looks through Willard. Then with a sadistic passive-aggressive transition, moves to the desk and sits before Willard, assuming a friend of the family tone.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Your family name is still on this factory, Willard. Martin - Stiles - Iron Works. Your father built this company. If nothing else, son, that should make you want to be proud of your work.
text: Willard submissively looks up to his boss.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: My mother's been sick.
text: Martin sits in the other chair beside Willard, placing a hand of false comfort on the employee's arm.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: And that's why you've fallen behind?
text: Willard nods. Out of intense disdain, Willard is unable to look at Mr. Martin.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Willard, I'm an old friend of the family. I've known your mother since before you were born. She should be comfortable.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And you, young man, shouldn't carry that kind of burden.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your father was like a father to me and I promised him I would always take care of you and your mother. That as long as she was alive...you'd have a job here.
text: CAMERA CRANES DOWN TO WILLARD'S FEET. Out of Mr. Martin's view. Willard angrily digs his shoe tip into the carpet.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: With a false sagacity.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
dialog: And in keeping with that promise, I have to advise you to find your mother a good rest care facility.
speaker_heading: WILLARD - ABOVE EYE LEVEL
text: His eyes aimed down, anywhere but directly at his boss...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: We can't afford that.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Martin rises and returns to his desk while making a suggestion; delivered as if it were an off the cuff idea.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Why not sell your house?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'd buy it from you! I mean...what are friends for?
dialog: Willard stands, a bit shaky.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Martin, I'll catch up. I'll stay late.
text: Martin burns, aware Willard is politely disrespecting him.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: And pay you more in overtime than it costs me for a temp?
text: Willard backs away and cautiously turns toward the door.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Goddamn right you'll catch up!
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - MORNING
text: Willard opens the door. Mr. Martin, face red, shouts in the b.g. For all the employees to hear.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: What you'll never understand...
text: Willard holds the doorway, his eyes having caught --
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
text: Averts her sympathetic eyes.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Is that business is a rat race and promise or no promise...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Continues toward his desk, leaving Mr. Martin framed in his office doorway.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: I will not get eaten by all those other rats...because of you!
dialog: Stuck Like Glue
scene_heading: INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE - NIGHT - GLUE TRAPS
text: Willard's hand removes a cellophane package holding four cardboard rectangles dabbed with industrial glue.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Having stopped after his hard day at work and holding a package of new plug fuses, he studies the glue trap package.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - GLUE TRAP PACKAGE
dialog: Disposable; just throw everything away! "Your hands never touch the pest or glue!"
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Like a rat, CAMERA CREEPS EERILY ACROSS THE FLOOR, assembling several dozen 4X6 cardboard squares strategically placed throughout the basement. CAMERA CONTINUES toward a flashlight beam aimed in an open fuse-box. Willard screws a new plug fuse into the box. The overhead lights flash until sparks snap from the fuse box. The lights BLOW!
text: Once again, left to the flashlight beam, Willard jumps back and while fanning the blue smoke billowing from the fuse box.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: FUCK ME! Can't I do anything!?
scene_heading: INT. WILLARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Willard is asleep. It's not a fit sleep. His tense fingers clench the covers while his teeth GRIND. CAMERA HOLDS. In the silence... In the darkness...
text: Suddenly O.S., in the basement, a horrific nonhuman SHRIEK of shreds the silence.
text: CAMERA SNEAKS IN on Willard awakened and disoriented, frightened by the high pitched squeals of a rat. REEK! REEK! REEK! REEK! REEK!
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
speaker_heading: CLARK! CLARK! CLARK!
text: Willard throws down the covers and jumps out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Eyes wide in a cold sweat, Willard races down the hall toward the stairway. Passing his mother's bedroom, CAMERA CATCHES a glimpse of her sitting upright in bed, trembling with fear.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: What is it?! What is it?!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: The volume of squeals intensifies as Willard runs toward the cellar door. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he whisks the door open unto a dark abyss. The squeals become blaring. REEK! REEK!
text: Out of habit, he clicks the light switch, but it doesn't work. Having placed a flashlight on the top step, he grabs it, CLICKS it on and whips the beam down the stairs.
speaker_heading: IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM
text: Nothing but cold cement. The shrieking continues...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Eyes wincing at the horrific sound, yet desperate to find it a source, searches with the flashlight...
text: Suddenly, movement. A small two weeks old white rat with red eyes is caught in the glue trap. However, only the hind legs are stuck and immobilized. The front legs remain free. Desperately scuttling across the floor like an amputee panhandler gone mad on his wheeled cart.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: His head and eyes dart, watching the young rat. The pest situation, his mother, his work seems to boil over. Enough.
text: He marches into the cellar, grabbing the first lethal tool he finds, a garden hand cultivator with three pointed prongs. As he turns and searches for the rat on the floor...
text: A second PLEA cuts through the white rats' SHRIEKS.
speaker_heading: IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM
text: The light pans up to the hole in the wire mesh. An older, larger white rat, surrounded by a half-dozen young rats looks directly at Willard.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Senses this is the mother of the trapped rat. The mother rat expresses a submissive posture to Willard; ears back and head down, eyes toward him...
text: Willard instinctively senses the mother's plea for mercy.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: While the young rat REEK! REEK! REEKS!, darting in and out of FRAME on the floor, Willard returns to the shelf holding rusted garden tools. HE sets down the hand cultivator, quickly places a pair of work gloves on his hands and turns toward the small white rat.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - YOUNG WHITE RAT
text: Darts across the floor, trying to escape the light and the gargantuan figure chasing him.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Holding the flaslight, in his favorite pajamas and bare feet, grabs the rat with his free, glove3d hand.

dialog: Highlighted in a blue rectangle "In case of accidental contact with adhesive, apply vegetable oil..."
speaker_heading: THE YOUNG WHITE RAT
text: Gooey vegetable oil pours over the rodent's hind legs, held in Willard's gloved hand. The rat squirms, but doesn't squeal.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Willard, still in his pajamas, is rattled and flustered. He sets down the jar of oil and attempts to pull the rat from the glue trap. The white rat softly squeals.
scene_heading: INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Mrs. Stiles, supported by her walker and perspiring, leans her ear toward the door.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You shouldn't be out of bed. You're feverish.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: I get afraid, Clark. Your father was in that bathroom late. That night.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I know. I'll never do what Father did.
text: She looks to her shoulder, puzzled.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: What is that on your hand?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Soap. Back to bed, Mother.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: It's cooking oil!
dialog: (scolding)
dialog: Willard, you're too old for that! When will you find yourself a girl!
text: CAMERA HOLDS in the hallway for the amount of time it takes Willard to quickly return his mother to bed. After a beat, he reappears, closes the door and returns to the bathroom.
dialog: A Friend in Socrates
scene_heading: INT. 2ND FLOOR BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: A DRAWER is pulled open. The towel is unraveled and the young, white rat shakes its head. Cute, actually.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Nearly smiles, holding the towel in his hands. He moves to the sink and quietly turns on the warm water. Grabbing a bar of soap, he cups some water and begins rinsing the white rat.
dialog: It lets him.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You seem pretty wise, except for getting caught in the trap.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You should be called Socrates.
text: The rat SQUEAKS, as if approving of the name. Moved by another creature displaying fondness towards him.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: CAMERA BEGINS INCHING BACK while holding the rat in his hand, Willard opens a drawer, rummages, and produces a plastic comb. As he begins gently grooming the rat's fur...
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: A flashlight CLICKS. The beam appears directly on the mother rat behind the torn wire mesh, however she does not run away even while human FOOTSTEPS APPROACH...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Holding the young, white rat, moves to the opening in the wall and holds before the mother rat and her offspring. Willard raises the white rat and sets it before the mother. The large white rat squeaks while rubbing her head over Socrates.
text: Fascinated, Willard studies the homecoming. Then, as if wishing to contribute, Willard crosses to the storage shelves. He opens a can of Planter's peanuts.
text: Sprinkling some in his hand while returning to the mesh screen, Willard lays peanuts on the opening's frame.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Food.
text: The mother pauses, rears on her hind legs and squeaks. Willard smiles, nods...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Food!
text: After mother CHIRPS, her litter begins eating the peanuts, holding the kernels between their paws.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: CAMERA INCHES ON TO HIM, unafraid and fascinated.
speaker_heading: OPENING IN BASEMENT WALL
text: After a series of squeaks from the mother, the family suddenly, hastily, hustles off with their peanuts.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Is saddened by the sudden departure, and moves to the opening and shines the light inside but the family is gone. CAMERA RETREATS FROM WILLARD, as he once again feels nothing but loneliness in the dark, cold basement.
text: He returns the peanut can to the storage shelf and starts towards the stairs. O.S., a soft squeak. Willard turns...
speaker_heading: OPENING IN BASEMENT WALL
dialog: Socrates. Alone. Looks at Willard.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Eyes pathetically welling with tears.
scene_heading: INT. WILLARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Socrates is asleep on the bed, curled up against the swell of Willard's back. Willard softly strokes the rat's fur and whispers, as if commenting on his earlier statement in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I'd never let anyone hurt you, Socrates, I promise.
text: Willard closes his eyes and settles into the bed. His hands are not tense. He does not grind his teeth.
speaker_heading: OVERHEAD ANGLE
text: As if crawling along the ceiling, CAMERA PULLS AWAY across the silent room. Eerie, elongated shadows of the barred windows intertwine with bare tree branches outside, flickering upon the floor.
text: High upon the shelves, still only partially discernible in the shadows, CAMERA HOLDS on an unsettling voyeur.
text: Ben, the foot and a half long black Norwegian rat, sits atop the shelves. Witness to Willard's promise to Socrates.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
dialog: A Successful Man's Car
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - FACTORY - MORNING
text: In the cold morning, Ms. Leach struggles to place a cover on a new silver Mercedes S55 AMG parked in Mr. Martin's spot. Workers en route to the foundry drool with envy.
text: Hustling to the front door, Willard eyes the car with hate.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - MORNING
text: The decrepit elevator rises caged in a thick wire mesh.
scene_heading: INT. FACTORY ELEVATOR - MORNING
text: Alone in the elevator, he closes his eyes tight, trembling with disgust and anger. The elevator jolts to a stop. The interior metal door opens.
text: Willard blindly begins opening the second wire mesh door, however it suddenly WHIPS closed with a slam!
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
text: Stands angrily outside the elevator in the hallway. With a flick of his hand he latches the wire door closed, trapping Willard like a rat in a cage.
text: Willard tries to open the door, but it's locked. He pathetically eyes Mr. Martin who glares sadistically.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Like my new S55?
text: Willard, now perspiring, trapped and so humiliated as to become incapacitated to a response. Besides, he doesn't know what is meant by "S55". Martin clarifies.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: You like my new...Mercedes-Benz? I saw you admiring it.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Um, yes, Mr. Martin. It's very...
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: Know why I have that car, Willard?
text: Willard is about to offer a desperate answer, however, Mr. Martin isn't really interested.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: For you. I own that 350 horsepower engine for you, Willard. For your job. For your fellow employees.
text: Making matters worse, Willard's fellow employees begin leaning out the office door to see what's going on.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Buyers feel a sense of security when they see proof that they're dealing with a successful man. So, when they see me pull up in that Mercedes AMG Class, they'll buy from us over some slob with a Jaguar S-Type.
text: Slightly hyper-ventilating, Willard tugs at the door.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: And do you know how I'm able to shell out ninety grand for that edge over our competitors?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Because I'm a successful man! Because I get to work ON TIME! And when I get to work, I don't look like a drowned rat in short sleeve shirts and cheap ties.
dialog: Mr. Martin steps closer to his prisoner...
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Because I get the job done! Because I never made my boss carry a temp for eight weeks!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I made it because I never caused my boss such grief!
text: With these last words, upon reflex, Willard's eyes flash hatefully to Martin who reads this and, in turn, reflexively, guiltily and defensively hisses.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Why do I waste my time? You'll never even own a car.
text: And without unlocking the wire mesh door, Mr. Martin turns and starts toward the office at the end of the hall. The nosey employees scurry like rats back into the office.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Weakened, he tugs at the door. It's locked and as CAMERA RECEDES into the empty hallway, he appears like a helpless animal in a cage.
text: After several beats, HEELS CLACK, O.S., on the floor. Cathryn ENTERS, heading toward the elevator.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: You okay?
text: If he answered, he'd burst into tears. She opens the door, he nods thankfully, and begins walking quickly to his office.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - EVENING
text: It's dark outside. Willard's working. Besides Ms. Leach, the employees have left for the day. Cathryn, however, remains. O.S., a door opens.
text: CAMERA INCHES INTO WILLARD, his eyes peering up beneath his brows.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - MR. MARTIN'S OFFICE
text: Sharp leather briefcase in hand, Mr. Martin turns off his office lights and starts out, shooting a mean look at --
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Submitting, averts his eyes.
speaker_heading: OFFICE
text: Mr. Martin exits. Ms. Leach eyes the door and waits a couple beats before turning off her desk lamp and grabbing her coat.
speaker_heading: MS. LEACH
dialog: Don't stay too late, Cathryn.
text: Ms. Leach forces a smile at Cathryn while ignoring Willard. In turn, Cathryn forces a nod, embarrassed for Willard. Once Leach exits, Cathryn turns to Willard who continues working.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: Should I order some food?
text: Willard looks up, guilty, then returns to his busy work. Shy, not annoyed with her.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I'll finish. You shouldn't have your night ruined over this.
dialog: (trying to joke)
dialog: I don't have a life, so nothing gets ruined.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: What makes you think I have a life?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Really. I'll finish. Take off and put on your time card that you stayed two more hours.
text: He smiles, forcing a mischievous laugh. She returns the smile while sadly eyeing him.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: One way to get back at him, huh?
dialog: He nods, shrugs.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: That man is accumulating some serious Karmic shit. I hate to think what creature he's comin' back as to pay it off. A worm, or a pig...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Maybe...a rat?
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: Nah. The Jains, in India, they believe rats are reincarnated in the next life as holy men.
text: Willard considers. She misinterprets his silence as discomfort and offers an explanation to her knowing this.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: Did some soul searching after my husband left me.
text: Willard nods, awkward. He doesn't know how to talk about such things. She studies him.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: You could use some soul searching, Willard. Why are you here?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (proud)
dialog: Well, Mr. Martin can't fire me. My father sold the company to Mr. Martin under the contractual
dialog: stipulation that I'd always have a job here.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: No, no. Why are you here? Me, I'm broke. Why don't you quit?
dialog: Willard shifts uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: My father would be very hurt.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: He's not alive.
text: Willard sadly shakes his head, "no". Then looks up, trying awkwardly to lighten and change the subject.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Maybe he's been reincarnated.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: No doubt.
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Can I ask how he died?
dialog: Willard pauses, emotional.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: What do people come back as if...if they killed themselves?
text: Cathryn eyes him sympathetically and avoids answering, as the answer is not what Willard needs to hear right now.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: Fuck this place. Let's go drink.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Oh...oh...can you imagine how he'd be if I don't get this done? No, thanks. You go.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: Then I have to drink alone. Or with my cats.
dialog: (laughs, clarifies)
dialog: I've got cats. I swear, I'm going to end up like those old ladies with, you know, hundreds of cats in her house. Ever read about one of those nutballs?
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Nothin' worse than bein' lonely.
text: Willard agrees with a nod. He's tempted, but shakes his head. With a sigh, she stands and puts on her coat. Willard stands an awkward gentlemen.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: I'm not hitting on you, Willard. Just feels like we could both use a friend.
text: He floats toward the window as she gathers her purse and looks to him one more time.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: We'd both feel better if I just did this. I won't be too long.
text: Cathryn forces a smile and starts out. Leaving him alone in the large office. Willard averts his eyes, regretting. He looks out the window and holds.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: Having stored the automobile's cover in the trunk, Mr. Martin gets in his beautiful car and shuts the door.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - WILLARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Willard moves to his desk, opens a drawer and removes a keychain.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - FACTORY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Willard moves through a box cluttered hallway, an area in which employees stash stuff everyone knows will never be dealt with again. Willard pushes aside some stacked boxes and REVEALS a door. He fishes for a key on the ring.
scene_heading: INT. STOREROOM - NIGHT - CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS
text: A cardboard Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer smiles from a box storing tinsel, Christmas lights, and "Happy Holidays" banners. Dusty boxes of invoices and records are piled beside janitorial supplies.
text: A single rear fluorescent panel is lit in the rear of the room. Willard enters, closes the door, and begins searching the storeroom, as if looking for someone.
text: CAMERA MOVES along an aisle of shelves, between Willard and CAMERA, until a silhouette of a rat ENTERS FRAME. The rat squeaks. Willard releases a relieved and welcoming smile.
text: Willard moves to Socrates, now much larger at ten weeks old.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Had a bad day, Socrates.
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN as Socrates climbs up Willard's arm and nuzzles in his neck while Willard scratches Socrates' head.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - ELEVATOR - LATER
text: O.S., a CLACK, as Willard, holding an accordion briefcase, shuts out the office lights and moves into the dark lonely hallway toward the elevator.
dialog: Tear It!
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - LATER
text: CLICK! A flashlight beam SHINES. It's quiet in the basement until Willard, happy to see the rats, moves down the stairs.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Food!
text: Then, O.S., the approaching scuttle of dozens of rats, having multiplied from the original family of half-a-dozen.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Food! Sorry we're late...
text: Willard places Socrates on a bench while moving to a large coffee can filled with pet store bought soybean rat pellets. Willard playfully disperses them on the floor.
text: THE HOLE IN THE BASEMENT WALL
text: THREE DOZEN RATS swarm over each other and climb down a thick piece of rope to the floor.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Scratches the head of the large white rat.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Hi, Ma.
text: He happily feeds the other rats, placing food on the floor.
speaker_heading: INT. BASEMENT - LATER
text: The three dozen rats play on the floor by the light of the flashlight. Willard has fabricated a rat playground. Some push ropes. Others race on a wheel. CAMERA PUSHES through them, playing over the basement floor.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Sits on a box, head down, still in his work clothes. He holds a rolled up newspaper and absently taps it against his shin; not for any reason other than something to do while thinking.
speaker_heading: SOCRATES
text: Begins playfully tearing at the paper...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Smiles, playing, and moves the paper out of reach.
speaker_heading: SOCRATES
text: Stands on its hind legs, clawing, trying to reach the paper.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Lowers the paper to Socrates. With a playful tone.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Tear it. Come on. Tear it.
speaker_heading: SOCRATES
text: Is joined by another. Both gnaw at the paper.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (O.S.)
dialog: Good. Tear it. Teach 'em, Socrates. They listen to you...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Lifts the paper, holds...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Tear it...
dialog: Willard lowers the paper...
speaker_heading: THE TWO RATS
text: Socrates SQUEAKS as if reiterating Willard's command. The rats tear at the roll of newsprint. A third rat joins the others. After a beat, Willard lifts the paper.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Waits, holds, then...as if an idea occurs to him, he speaks in a tone of menace.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Tear it.
speaker_heading: THE THREE RATS
text: Learning quickly, begins tearing at the newspaper.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Studies the rats, Socrates squeaking at the others. Then, as Willard considers:
text: O.S., a thick, meaty tear. The sound is out of place amongst the rats. Willard pauses, listens. Again, a TEAR and HEAVY GNAWING. Willard slowly raises the flashlight and pans it in the direction of the sound.
speaker_heading: IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM
text: Across the dark basement revealing an old tire leaning against the wall. The light TILTS DOWN to find BEN, a foot and a half long and easily five pounds. Like a small dog. Ben's teeth sink into the tire and shred away a slice of rubber.
speaker_heading: WILLARD - REVERSE ANGLE
dialog: He's shocked by Ben's size. And power.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Jesus, you're big. Big Ben.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: ALONG THE GROUND, CAMERA MOVES TOWARD BEN. Unaffected by the light, Willard's presence or the other rats.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Absently nods as answering Ben's question. Socrates runs up Willard's shoulder.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Do you know him, Socrates?
dialog: Socrates squeaks.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Well, Ben. Any friend of Socrates is a friend of mine.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Tears a chunk of rubber from the tire, then coolly seems to look over its should to Willard, suggesting "Get the idea?".
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: As if he's understanding...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Ben, this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
speaker_heading: INT. BASEMENT - LATER
text: Lead by Socrates, the three-dozen rats have been broken into four teams, each violently gnawing on bicycle tires and the car tire. Socrates moves like a drill instructor, snapping at those which are not attacking the rubber.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Away from the others, coolly watches his idea being
dialog: implemented in the first stage.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Snaps his fingers, in command.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Tear it.
dialog: (snaps fingers)
speaker_heading: TEAR IT UP!
speaker_heading: INT. BASEMENT - LATER
text: Two worn carrying bags ENTER FRAME held at the handles by Willard dressed in different clothes than in the last scene.
text: The bags, seemingly floating across the basement. In the b.g., seventy-five rats now live in the basement. Swarming on shelves, work benches and stairs.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Still.
text: He continues encircling the basement, holding each bag.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Still...
text: Not a sound emits from either bag. He sets each bag down and kneels over them, pleased. He opens one bag, then the other. After a beat, he SNAPS his fingers.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Out.
dialog: Lead by Socrates, a dozen rats flood from each bag.
speaker_heading: INT. BASEMENT - LATER
text: A flashlight beam flares INTO FRAME. CAMERA FOLLOWS as Willard, holding the flashlight, moves across the basement tossing soybean rat pellets to the hundred rats. Willard's wardrobe is different than the last scene. Time has passed.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Good work. Good work tonight.
text: Willard scans the basement, making a calling "kissing" sound.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Socrates. Upstairs. Bed.
text: Ben moves up the stairs toward the door.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No, not Ben. BED. Only Socrates sleeps in bed.
text: Ben continues up the stairs. With the ire of a pet owner whose animal will not listen, Willard takes an aggressive step toward Ben.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: BEN! I SAID, "NO!"
dialog: O.S., Socrates SQUEAKS. Willard searches for the sound...
scene_heading: LOW ANGLE - ACROSS THE BASEMENT
text: Willard swings the flashlight toward two rats, silhouetted in the f.g. One rat lies motionless, arms and claws curled while the other nudges the body.
text: Willard approaches, setting the light on a table, angled down, creating macabre light overhead. Willard kneels, studying the dead white rat. Socrates runs to Willard and climbs in his lap.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (a whisper)
dialog: No. Oh, Ma, no.
text: Willard reaches out and holds the limp body. Finding a box of black plastic Hefty trash bags, he pulls the last bag and carefully, respectfully, wraps Socrates' mother in the black plastic. He sets her on the floor.
text: Tears well as Willard looks to Socrates and scratches his head, comforting. CAMERA BEGINS RISING as Willard begins softly crying, holding Socrates against his cheek.
text: CAMERA CONTINUES, the flashlight spotlighting the intimate sadness of Willard and Socrates while a hundred active rats swarm across the basement floor.
dialog: Like a Man...on a Mission
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - MORNING
text: CAMERA MOVES with Willard, hustling urgently toward his desk. His fellow employees tense; subtly urging him on.
text: As he passes Mr. Martin's office, however, the door BANGS OPEN and the boss storms out. Passing Ms. Leach's desk, Mr. Martin extends his arm. She hands off a report in his hands.
text: Willard continues to his desk as Martin descends. Cathryn tenses. As Willard sits, Mr. Martin reaches Willard's desk and angrily throws the notebook down with a startling THUD!
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: One week! You've been late so many hours it equals an entire week!
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Martin...
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: I want that week back.
text: Willard reacts, puzzled, not understanding.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: I've consulted counsel and I may not be able to release you, but it is within my rights to administer fiscal disciplinary reprimands.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Martin. I know you must be tired of the excuse, but what can I do? My mother is sick.
text: Mr. Martin leans in over Willard.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: If you really cared for your mother, you'd show up to work on time. Because now you're out a week's pay.
text: Unlike his previous weak reactions, Willard turns inward. To a dark place. Mr. Martin heads back toward his office.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: And if you don't like it, quit! Be a man for once instead of the fucking mouse you are!
text: He storms to his office and slams the door!
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: CAMERA ABOVE HIS EYE-LINE AND PUSHING IN. Willard smiles to himself at the irony of Mr. Martin's last comment. Willard looks to his Rolodex and begins turning the knob.
speaker_heading: ROLODEX
dialog: Names flip past until settling upon "Martin, Frank. Wife - Barbara. 263 Adams. Irvington, N.Y., 10533."
text: As the card is yanked from the file...
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: With a tug, Willard opens the carrying bags, placed on their sides, his shadowy smile mischievous rather than sinister.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: In.
text: Lead by Socrates, two dozen rats begin filing into the bags.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Starts toward the bags. Willard's hand appears before him, halting him.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (O.S.)

dialog: Willard keeps Ben from entering the bags.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You're too big. There won't be room for anyone else.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Holds, appears angry O.S. Willard CLOSES THE BAGS with a snap, stands and crosses before Ben.
speaker_heading: BASEMENT STAIRS
text: Willard holds the bag handle in each hand, dressed for cold weather. Leather gloves, a worn long black overcoat and logo less baseball cap. He sets the bags on the landing, then reaches up to turn the doorknob. He opens the door; the kitchen, above, is dark.
text: Willard turns back to retrieve the bags. Then, as he turns, back to exit the basement, the flashlight catches his mother! Willard is too startled, and nearly drops the bags. Under lit by the flashlight, she appears frightening.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Willard hurriedly continues up the stairs, quickly shutting the door with his foot. He commands to the "luggage".
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Still!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: The door closes. He places the bags on the table.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: Still what? What does that mean?
speaker_heading: WILLARD

speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Still.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: There! You said it in front of my face but I don't know what it means. "Still". What are you saying? Why are you so mean to me?
text: Suddenly, she gasps. Willard tenses.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: Clark! I smell rats!
text: She tries to open the basement door. Willard takes his mother firmly by the arm. Picks up her walker and begins leading her out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Upstairs, Mother.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: Don't order me around! What are you up to? What's in those bags?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Business records Father kept.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: No! Father's records are in his upstairs office!
text: While Willard and his mother exit the kitchen, CAMERA HOLDS on the bags. Then CREEPS IN...
speaker_heading: WILLARD (O.S.)
dialog: The bags were downstairs. I'm taking them to the office.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: At this hour?!
speaker_heading: WILLARD (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Martin needs them for an early meeting.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES (O.S.)
dialog: That man! He doesn't appreciate or respect you!
speaker_heading: WILLARD (O.S.)
dialog: He will. He may not know it... But he will.

speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Takes a nervous breath and readies to approach the house. Suddenly, appearing behind him at his left blind side is a Brinks Neighborhood patrol car, ENTERING FRAME. The officer's attention is on Willard. The patrol car's RADIO is low. The officer is heard, but is indiscernible as he reports...
text: Willard nervously picks up his pace. The patrol car remains in his blind side. Willard sneaks a peek up the street.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - MARTIN'S HOUSE
dialog: Nears...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Wants to check over his shoulder, but cannot. Suddenly, yellow siren lights flash over him. Willard tenses, freezes as CAMERA SWEEPS in on him.

text: around Willard, from front to back. Willard looks up.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - PATROL CAR

text: Willard appears as if he's about to pass the house until finally, he dashes up the driveway.
speaker_heading: THE GARAGE DOOR

speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Turns to the second bag. Upon opening it, however, he's shocked as...BEN sticks his head out. He is the only rat in the bag. Willard appears angry and somewhat afraid.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Ben?! How'd you?...I told you to stay!
text: Ignoring Willard, Ben climbs out and moves to the other rats. Although annoyed with Ben, this is not the time to reprimand him. Willard sees the rats have torn several holes into the weather strip and door.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Tires...
text: He snaps his fingers.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Tear it.
text: Socrates leads the first team of rats, pouring out of the bag.
speaker_heading: HOLD IN THE WEATHER STRIP
dialog: If a rat can get its head through a hole the size of a
text: quarter, it can squeeze its entire body through the hole. The cuts in the weather strip are much larger than a quarter. The rats squeeze through and enter the garage.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Ben holds, continuing CHEWING. His head is bigger than the holes created by the other rats.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You won't fit.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Pushes his way through the opening in the base of the garage. Showing impressive strength, Ben "crashes" through.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Notes Ben's strength. Willard then leans his head close to the garage door. Inside, he can hear FAINT GNAWING.
scene_heading: INT. MR. MARTIN'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Ben moves to a tire and takes it on single-handed. The other tires are already being chewed - four rats to a tire.
scene_heading: EXT. GARAGE DOOR - MR. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Willard listens to the slight sound of TEARING and chewing.
scene_heading: INT. MR. MARTIN'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: A TIRE is aggressively gnawed by a team of rats.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Rips a strip of rubber.
speaker_heading: EXT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: Willard listens...HISS! Then another HISS!
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: The covered S55 Mercedes sinks as the rats chew around the rush of air. A TIRE POPS!
speaker_heading: EXT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Willard suppresses his giggle. He puts his hand to the garage door and SNAPS his fingers.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (a stage whisper)
dialog: Stop!
dialog: Then, inside the house...
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell's that?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: In!
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
dialog: Sounds like air or something.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: IN!
speaker_heading: WEATHER STRIP TO GARAGE
text: Socrates is the first to return. Rats hurriedly file out of the garage.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: As rats run toward the front door, a tire POPS! The car sinks causing the alarm to go off.
speaker_heading: EXT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Willard quickly gathers rats and puts them into the bag. A light turns on in the house.
speaker_heading: MRS. MARTIN (O.S.)
dialog: Someone in the garage?
text: Secures a bag O.S., in the garage, a door opens. A light turns on...
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
dialog: What the fuck!?
text: Ben hustles up and climbs into the bag. Frightened, Willard quickly closes the bag.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
dialog: My tires've been slashed. Call Brinks.
text: Just as Willard is about to make a dash toward the front yard, the garage door motors ENGAGE! The garage door begins opening. The car alarm stops.
text: Willard desperately cuts toward the side of the garage toward the back yard just as Mr. Martin appears and steps out of the garage, looking out into the front yard.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Willard moves as fast as he can without making much noise. CAMERA SUDDENLY DROPS DOWN to the ground revealing an area along the side of the house of landscaped gravel. As Willard runs on the crushed stones, CRUNCH! CRUNCH!...
text: Mr. Martin turns to the rear of the house. As he rounds the corner, he's struck by a strong beam of light -- Martin shields his eyes as he looks to --
speaker_heading: A BRINKS PATROL CAR
text: A patrolman aims the light from inside the car.
scene_heading: EXT. MR. MARTIN'S BACK YARD - NIGHT
text: The beam of light spills into the side of the garage.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
dialog: Someone just slashed my tires. They gotta be around here.
text: With that...Willard bolts across the backyard. CAMERA LEADS HIM as he tries to run with the bags. In the darkness, he runs into a chain-linked fence bordering the neighbor's yard.
speaker_heading: EXT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: The patrolman shines the light around the neighborhood.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: I'll check the back.
scene_heading: EXT. MR. MARTIN'S BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Willard hurriedly lifts a bag over the fence and drops it on the ground. As he lowers the second bag.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Martin moves along to the back yard.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Willard climbs the fence and drops into the neighbor's yard. He quickly picks up the bags and runs for his life.
scene_heading: EXT. MARTIN'S NEIGHBOR'S BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
text: As Willard charges across the neighbor's yard, a dog barks. This is not booming Rommel-like bark. It's the YAP of a Maltese or Jack Russel. Lights turn on inside the house.
text: The small YAPPING dog appears out of the darkness SNAPS at Willard's heels. Willard continues, searching for a path toward the front yard. He plows through some shrubs...
scene_heading: EXT. MARTIN'S NEIGHBOR'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS
text: Willard barrels through the bushes and hustles toward the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: SIDEWALK
text: Sweating and winded, Willard appears on the sidewalk, returning to a quick walk in order to avoid attracting any further attention. He checks behind for any signs of the Brinks patrol, however, they're not yet in sight.
dialog: This street is QUIET. Willard eases, until --
speaker_heading: THE YAPPING LITTLE DOG
text: Charges out of the front yard and runs toward Willard.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Picks up his pace. In a moment, the dog is at his heels barking and trying to get at the bags. Willard pushes the dog aside with his leg.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Go.
text: The dog continues barking, leaping to get at the bags. Willard nudges the dog with his foot.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Get away.
text: The dog, however, is a tenacious little tyke. Willard's eyes are crazed with a fury of which he did not seem capable.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: YOU WANNA SEE IN THE BAG, MOTHERFUCKER?!
text: He reaches down and grabs the dog. The bag is opened revealing a DOZEN RATS. The dog is tossed inside the bag and zipped shut.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
speaker_heading: TEAR IT UP!
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Willard resumes his walk up the pretty street. The bags begin knocking. He struggles to hold them. The dog's tough YAPPING has turned into muffled YELPS.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Pauses. Guilty. He sets the bags down and opens the one holding the rats and dog. The small lap dog springs out of the bag and hauls ass back toward its house.
speaker_heading: WIDE - THE STREET
text: Willard, a macabre form carrying the bags, continues up the street. He turns to the right and vanishes down another block. Up the road, on an intersecting street, a Brinks patrol car appears, slows, and not seeing anyone on the street, continues. As the neighborhood returns to SILENCE.
dialog: Mr. Martin's Loss of Control
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - FACTORY - MORNING
text: Willard enters, moving at a defiantly easy pace.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN'S PARKING SPOT
dialog: Vacant.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Smiles, pleased with himself as he strides toward the door.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - MORNING
text: The clock over the door indicates it is 9:20. Willard enters the bullpen with guarded anticipation. The employees are abuzz, gossiping, and rebellious; when the cat's away...
speaker_heading: GEORGE FOXX
dialog: Know what a set of those tires run?
speaker_heading: MS. LEACH
dialog: Insurance'll cover it.
speaker_heading: JANICE MANTIS
dialog: Insurance won't cover how pissed off he's gonna be.
text: En route to his desk, Willard can't help but grin.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: What's goin' on?
speaker_heading: JANICE MANTIS
text: Someone broke into Martin's garage last night, slashed his tires and peed on the floor.
text: Willard's pleased, he hadn't thought of that bonus. Reaching his desk, he flashes a somewhat flirtatious but definitely confident grin at Cathryn.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Mornin', Cat. You look very nice today.
text: She's caught off-guard. But charmed. She smiles a thanks.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Someone peed on his floor?
speaker_heading: GEORGE FOXX
dialog: Know what happened? When Martin saw his tires...
text: Mr. Martin storms in. Foxx is seated with his back, so he doesn't see...
speaker_heading: GEORGE FOXX
dialog: He pissed his pants, then blamed it on the guy who did it!
text: Foxx laughs but doesn't understand why the others turn dreadfully silent. He looks back to see the embarrassed and angry Mr. Martin. Foxx instantly turns obsequious.
speaker_heading: GEORGE FOXX
dialog: Good morning, Mr. Martin. Is everything okay?
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: You think it's so fuckin' funny? How do you like the thought of some sick fuck breaking into your house?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: He works to suppress his euphoria over Martin's agitation.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Scaring the shit out of your wife? Losing half a night's sleep dealing with the cops...
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN - WILLARD'S POV
text: Mr. Martin's look begins railing toward all the employees.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: And knowing that sick fuck is going to have control over you and your family's peace of mind for god knows how long?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: CAMERA HOLDS on Willard, pleased. In fact, at this point, having always SHOT WILLARD above eye level, now slowly, eerily, DROPS BELOW EYE LEVEL. It underlies his NEW SENSE OF CONFIDENCE AND POWER.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: How'd you like it, Foxx?
speaker_heading: WIDER - THE OFFICE
text: Mr. Martin holds, but of course, it is an intensely rhetorical question. Mr. Foxx nods with overstated sympathy and returns to the work at his desk.
speaker_heading: GEORGE FOXX
dialog: No, sir.
dialog: The employees follow much the same example and return to work while Mr. Martin eyes them like a street fighter whose just kicked some ass and postures "Anyone else want some?"
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: I didn't think so.
text: Mr. Martin returns to his office and slams the door.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Smiles with a newfound confidence. The CAMERA DROPS INTO HIS COAT POCKET. Willard's hand inside, stroking Socrates.
dialog: All Good Things...
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A flat wood crate is empty. A bag of store bought, soy rat pellets are poured into the box.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (O.S.)
dialog: Food.
text: Rats...swarming, writhing over one another. Charge the box. Hundreds and hundreds now live in the basement.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Willard looks over the numbers and sighs.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: We're running out of room.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: The dim glow of the flashlight seeps beneath the cellar door. Suddenly, the front legs of Mrs. Stiles' aluminum walker creep in.
text: Mrs. Stiles' breaths are heavy and strained. Her critical condition is clear before she's revealed by the craning camera. Although sweating and gray, she's determined to place her ear to the door and eavesdrop.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (O.S.)
dialog: I can't feed you anymore. I can't afford it.
text: Believing her son is rehearsing a speech to her, Mrs. Stiles tenses. Afraid.
speaker_heading: WILLARD (O.S.)
dialog: You have to find a new place to live. You'll be more comfortable somewhere else.
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: I wish they could, but...things can't last forever. All good things must come to an end.
text: Mrs. Stiles slightly trembles with shock and heartbreak as she pulls away from the door.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
dialog: As Willard looks about the rats.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Follow Ben. He'll find a place for you. He'll take care of you. Won't you, Ben?
dialog: (looking at Ben)
dialog: You're the leader...after Socrates.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - BEN
text: Is enthroned atop the storage shelves, above the other rats. Staring at Willard, Ben appears as if he feels he's the leader now...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Socrates climbs up Willard's arm to his shoulder. Willard reaches up and scratches his head. Willard turns his back on Ben and with a whispered tone to Socrates...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You're not going anywhere, Socrates. You'll always be with me.
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: I hate everyone but you.
text: Willard lovingly scratches Socrates while the hundreds of other rats swarm at his feet.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Let's go to bed.
text: He takes flashlight and moves to the stairs, passing Ben.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Goodnight, Ben.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Still, motionless, not pleased.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: The flashlight spill beneath the door intensifies as it reaches the door. As the door opens, Willard catches Ben making a break for it.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No! Ben...how many times do I have to tell you. Only Socrates is allowed upstairs.
text: Willard shuts the door.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS WILLARD, moving through the dark room, playfully kissing Socrates on the head.
text: As Willard makes a U-Turn around the span of an open foyer arch toward the stairs, Mrs. Stiles is REVEALED, collapsed on the stairway in a state of semi-consciousness.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Horrified.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Mother...
text: He rushes toward her...
speaker_heading: SOCRATES
text: Willard places him on the stairway newel post cap. The rat begins running up the banister.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
text: Hearing her son, she tries lifting herself to her feet, reaching for the banister.
speaker_heading: SOCRATES
text: Her hand just misses him.
scene_heading: STAIRWAY - WILLARD & MRS. STILES
text: The son gently places hands on her. She jerks away.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: Don't touch me! You're getting rid of me!
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (sincere)
dialog: No, Mother, I love you.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: I heard you! "All good things must come to an end!"
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I love you more than anything.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: You don't love me! You won't feed me! I hate you! I hate you!
text: She begins violently coughing. Alarmed, he rushes to her, holds her. She struggles to get free, causing him heartbreak.
text: Suddenly, Mrs. Stiles unintentionally HACKS a tablespoon of blood into her son's face. He fights back frightened tears, hands trembling as he holds his mother.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You need to go to the hospital.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
dialog: No! You wanna lock me up! You wanna kill me! You wanna kill me!
text: Willard shuts his eyes; covers his head with his arms, trying to block it out. Her screams sound like a scared animal.
speaker_heading: TOP OF THE STAIRCASE
text: Socrates is a black silhouette in the f.g., sitting atop the upper newel post cap, helplessly watching his friend Willard try to comfort his screaming mother.
scene_heading: INT. 2ND STORY LANDING - HALLWAY - WILLARD'S HOUSE - LATER
text: Through the ajar door, Mrs. Stiles can be seen asleep in her bed. Her BREATHING is strained. Willard's hands ENTER FRAME and gently dab her head with a cool wash cloth. He lifts the blankets to her chin.
dialog: Ben, the Defiant Leader
scene_heading: INT. WILLARD'S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Numb with sadness, Willard climbs into bed and turns off the light. Laying his head back, he stares at the ceiling while fighting tears.
speaker_heading: SIDE EDGE OF BED
text: The covers RUSTLE. Socrates appears over the bed's horizon and rushes toward Willard. The white rat nuzzles Willard's chin. Pulling the rat close, Willard closes his eyes and feels the comfort of his friend.
text: Then...the covers tucked under Willard's arms jerk toward the foot of the bed. Willard opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: FOOT OF THE BED - WILLARD'S POV
text: The covers jerk again. BEN APPEARS, using the covers to pull himself up. He holds at the foot of the bed.
speaker_heading: WILLARD & SOCRATES
dialog: Willard tenses.
speaker_heading: SOCRATES
text: Squeaks, as if pleading with Ben to get off.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Remains. He's staying.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: What if Mother sees you?
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Doesn't care. Remains still. Challenging.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Considers this. Then suddenly whisks off the covers, grabs Ben by the nape of his neck. The large rat HISSES and struggles as Willard carries him out.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: CAMERA IS LOW ANGLE, looking up the first set of stairs, swarming with rats. Willard gently tosses Ben on the stairs, quickly grabs the edge of the door.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Down, Ben. You stay down!
dialog: As Willard quickly shuts the door --
scene_heading: INT. MRS. STILES' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The door slam causes her eyes to open. She holds in the darkness, puzzled and afraid.
scene_heading: INT. WILLARD'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Willard's asleep. Socrates curled up against his back. The alarm clock RINGS. Willard awakens and turns off the alarm. As he reaches back to pet Socrates, Willard freezes. Eyes toward the foot of the bed:
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Holds at the foot of the bed, in the same spot he claimed last night.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Glares back.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Glares back.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: On angry impulse, viciously kicks Ben, who's violently knocked to the floor.
text: Ben scuttles out the door and into the hallway. Willard follows after him.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: As Willard appears at the end of the hall, he catches a glimpse of Ben darting down the banister. Willard starts after him, yet pauses at his mother's room. He softly moves to close her door, then pauses.
scene_heading: INT. MRS. STILES' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: She's not there.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: A half-dozen rats crawl about the base of the stairs. Upon seeing them, Willard quickly hustles down the steps.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Mother!
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: The cellar door is open. Rats climb out from the basement. Willard appears, shocked.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV
text: Over 150 rats are everywhere: on the table, the counters, in the cupboards, eating anything they can find.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Turns to the basement door, anticipating what he'll find...
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: On the first landing, a fading flashlight beam shines aimless from beneath a pack of swarming rats.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Puzzled, steps closer. He freezes.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV
text: The flashlight is gripped in his mother's stiff dead hand, scaly pink rat tails flop across the fingers. The rats do not know death. She is just another object.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Shudders. His breaths rapid and deep.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: No! NO!
text: He snaps his trembling fingers.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
speaker_heading: DOWN! DOWN!
text: The rats obey the command and begin moving down the stairs. Socrates assists, herding the others toward the cellar.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
text: Positioned as if having fallen forward, her opened eyes reflect the expression of frozen shock. REVEALED as the rats climb off her.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Holds atop a cupboard staring down at Willard.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Looks up, increasingly impatient with Ben.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You think you're funny? You think you're smart?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Socrates. He's smart. He knows they have to take mother away.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And if they see you...they'll take me away. Then come back for you.
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Appears to consider. He lifts his head, then moves off into the shadows.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: His expression reflects growing detest as Ben crawls over his feet, into the basement, past his mother's feet.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - AFTERNOON
text: Reminiscent of Soctrates' mother, Mrs. Stiles' dead body lies inside a black plastic body bag. A PULLED STRAP secures her to a coroner's gurney.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Willard signs paperwork on a clipboard and returns it to a deputy medical examiner who absently tosses the clipboard atop the body bag.
text: With a startling CLACK, the gurney is raised and wheeled out of the house. Willard slowly shuts the door.
text: The house is quiet and lonely. Emotionally numb, Willard wanders to the stairs and must sit. The stretched shadows of the barred windows reach Willard, causing him to appear like a prisoner or a caged rat.
text: After a beat, Socrates crawls into Willard's lap. The white rat nuzzles against Willard, comforting him.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I love her...and I'll miss her. I already miss her. She was my mother.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But, if you ever died, Socrates...
dialog: He cannot bear to complete the thought.

dialog: Death and Bankruptcy
scene_heading: INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY
text: Mrs. Stiles rests in modest casket. O.S., "Peace in the Valley" plays on a programmed organ. Willard approaches the coffin. Eyes red and swollen from crying, he leans over and kisses her.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: At least you're with father again.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: My friend would like to say goodbye.
text: Willard cautiously checks over his shoulder. He's the only person at the service. He removes Socrates from his coat pocket and holds him out toward the head of the casket.
speaker_heading: MRS. STILES
text: Socrates brushes his nose against her dead face.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Holding the rat to his mother, is about to cry again.
speaker_heading: WIDER - CASKET
text: Willard's back is to us. From this angle, Socrates can't be seen. Cathryn steps INTO FRAME, her back also to CAMERA.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
text: Holds a beat, taking sad notice of the empty room.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Remains unaware of her.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S HANDS
text: Strokes his mother's face, and then the rat's...
speaker_heading: CATHRYN (O.S.)
dialog: Willard?
text: Startled, he thinks quickly, places Socrates inside the casket. Willard eyes over his shoulder, then back to the coffin.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: In.
speaker_heading: SOCRATES
text: Waddles deep into the casket, disappearing into the dark toward Mrs. Stiles' feet.
speaker_heading: WILLARD & CATHRYN
text: He turns just as she carefully approaches the casket.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: Are you alright? I didn't mean to upset you.
text: With residual startle, he shakes his head and guides her away from the coffin and to the chairs. They sit.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: You didn't have to come here.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: We didn't hear from you and I wanted to make sure you're okay. To let you know...you have a friend.
text: Willard is caught off guard and sincerely touched. His eyes begin to well, bringing tears to his eyes. She reaches out and softly caresses his face.
text: This may be the first time he's ever been touched in such a way. As he begins to close his eyes and cherish the moment, his eyes freeze. Never fully closing.
speaker_heading: WILLARD'S POV - MR. MARTIN
text: Enters, appearing annoyed and put upon. He moves to the casket.
speaker_heading: WILLARD & CATHRYN
text: As Willard hatefully looks off, Cathryn turns to see Mr. Martin. Sparing them further hassle, she pulls her hand away.
speaker_heading: CASKET
text: Mrs. Stiles rests in the f.g., just beneath the closed half of the casket lid hides Socrates. Martin ENTERS FRAME, takes a perfunctory look and moves off.
speaker_heading: FUNERAL HOME
text: Willard and Cathryn avert their eyes as Martin approaches. Dismissive, he eyes Willard, then, somewhat lasciviously, eyes Cathryn.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Shouldn't you be working?
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: (defiantly)
dialog: Lunch hour.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: (with a laugh)
dialog: Hell of a way to spend it, huh?
text: He looks to Willard, who doesn't look back.
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: She's better off, Willard.
dialog: (a dig at Willard)
dialog: She's with your dad.
text: Willard doesn't acknowledge this in any manner. Behind Mr. Martin, a man, JOSEPH GARTER, Mr. Martin's age, suit and tie enters and moves to the casket paying a brief moment of respect. The man looks toward Willard while...
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: What now? Gonna sell the house?
dialog: Willard shrugs, then with false altruism...
speaker_heading: MR. MARTIN
dialog: Give it some thought. Take the rest of the day off.
text: He pats Willard on the leg, shoots Cathryn a jilted look and moves out of the funeral parlor. Cathryn places a sympathetic hand on Willard's back, however, before any words are exchanged about Mr. Martin's behavior, they're approached by Mr. Garter.
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: Willard Stiles?
text: Willard looks up, nods.
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: I'm Joseph Garter, I'm an attorney with Montgomery & Glick, the trustees of your mother's estate.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've been trying to reach you, but...you don't answer the phone.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I hope you take no offense by my finding you. Here. We are all saddened by your loss.
dialog: (beat; to Cathryn)
dialog: May I have a moment with Willard?
text: Cathryn reacts, flustered by the situation.
speaker_heading: CATHRYN
dialog: Can I come over after work? Check up on you?
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I'll be okay. Thanks, Cat.
text: She gives him an awkward hug, then moves off while Mr. Garter turns a chair around to face Willard.
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: Willard, I'm afraid I have some news... I don't know if you're aware of or prepared for.
dialog: Willard reacts, puzzled.
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: Your parents had been living off an account they had originally set up for your future. It was intended to be yours upon their passing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: However, your father's death left debts that even Mr. Martin's buy out didn't completely relieve.
dialog: Willard tenses.
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
text: In fact, there remains pending litigation on some unsettled debts.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: I still have the house?
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: Your mother refinanced the house after your father's death, so, in fact, we still owe...
dialog: Willard's devastated.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: We? It's my house.
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: Of course, you grew up there. It's your home, but it is the bank's house.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: It's my house.
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: There's no need for a single man to live in such a large house. Sell it.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Why do I have to pay for what things my parents did?
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: The money will help you start over.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Start over?! I'm almost done!
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: Willard, you have no choice. As the executor...
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Then why...why'd you come here?! Why do you even bother telling me?! Do you get off on telling me I have no control over my own life?! I have no money. No home. And it's not my fault!
text: Mr. Garter stands and reaches for his business card.
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: This is not the time or place. Think about it. Then please, you have to contact me.
text: Willard snaps the card out of Mr. Garter's hand.
speaker_heading: MR. GARTER
dialog: I understand, Willard, however, this is the only way you can take control of your own life.
text: Willard sighs, settles. Mr. Garter takes a beat, assured that Willard has composed, then moves out of the room. Willard stands and moves toward his mother's casket.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
dialog: Socrates.
text: Socrates appears from behind the bottom lid and scuttles to Willard who picks him up and holds the rat against his cheek. As Willard looks to his mother, he notes movement O.S.
speaker_heading: THROUGH STAINED GLASS WINDOW

speaker_heading: WILLARD

text: Hesitating, he removes a Swiss Army knife from the package and opens the blade. Along the edge is a line of brown stained blood. Willard untucks his shirt and rubs the blade. The blood is gone.

text: Stirs, awakens, lazily opens one eye. He sees:
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Motionless, yet taunting.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Waits a beat, then, slowly and carefully extends his arm and reaches beneath the pillow. Willard reacts, puzzled. He digs deeper beneath the pillows, but apparently can't find the swagger stick. His eyes move toward the right side of the bed. Willard reacts, afraid...
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Just above the bed is the swagger stick. Chewed to slivers. Recognizable only by the metal tips. Willard looks to:
speaker_heading: BEN
text: Stoic and yet an air of satisfied retaliation.
speaker_heading: WILLARD
text: Climbs out of bed. Unable to keep the peace, Socrates squeaks, head moving back and forth from Willard to Ben. Willard moves to the closet and looks inside.

speaker_heading: OFFICE
text: Willard is intensely confused, as if the contents are inconceivable. Let alone incomprehensible. He looks to Cathryn, desk buttressed against his. She reacts to his bewilderment. Unable to speak and certain there is some mistake, he hands the letter to
