scene_heading: INT. HONG KONG - SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - DAY
text: Twenty boys, aged 7 to 12, sit at spartan desks, bibles raised. FATHER
text: O'NEAL walks amongst them. A career Jesuit with razor eyes and thin lips. An
dialog: awful man.
speaker_heading: FATHER 0'NEAL
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: Sumeria.
dialog: And what happened to him Francis?
dialog: FRANCIS, 12, is the eldest and largest boy.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: Jesus' disciples came and performed

dialog: miracles he offered disciple Peter
dialog: gold for the powers of God.
speaker_heading: FATHER 0'NEAL
dialog: What did disciple Peter say to that?
dialog: Michael Quinn?
dialog: Father O'Neal stands before the youngest, littlest boy, who, unlike the others,
dialog: exhibits no fear in his huge, intelligent eyes. Father O'Neal hates this boy.
text: The boy, MICHAEL QUINN, doesn't respond.
text: Father O'Neal snatches his bible, revealing a SECOND BOOK hidden behind it.
dialog: It's a dime store pulp adventure with a gaudy cover entitled "THE KNIGHTS
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR."
speaker_heading: FATHER 0'NEAL
dialog: Answer the question Michael.
text: The little boy stares up at him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL QUINN
dialog: That's not my name.
text: Father O'Neal yanks the boy from the chair. Drags him by the arm across the
dialog: room and out into the corridor.
text: THE OTHER BOYS wait two seconds, then they spring up and run, en masse,
text: to the door. Grouped in the threshold, straining for a good view, they watch
dialog: as --
text: FATHER O'NEIL pulls Michael Quinn into an office down the corridor. The door
dialog: has a stained-glass window.
text: It begins. We see it in SILHOUETTE: Father O'Neal with a CANE SWITCH in
text: his hand, the boy beneath him. Down the switch comes. Again. And again.
dialog: The boy YELPS. And again and again and again... and now he SCREAMS...
text: THE BOYS HUDDLED IN THE DOORWAY begin to wince. With every repeated,
dialog: merciless descent of the switch...
scene_heading: INT. SAINT IGNATIUS ORPHANAGE - EATING HALL - NIGHT
text: THE BOYS sit at benches. Michael Quinn stares stoically ahead. The back of
text: his shirt is striped with blood.
dialog: FATHER YIN, 50's, a Chinese Jesuit, grim in black frock and white collar,
text: paces amongst the benches. Father O'Neal watches from the side.
speaker_heading: FATHER YIN
dialog: Why one child is born into a good

dialog: is but part of God's design. All of
dialog: you are unwanted, put here because
dialog: of the sins of your unwedded

speaker_heading: FATHER YIN
dialog: Who is that, boy?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL QUINN
dialog: Father Michael Quinn.
speaker_heading: FATHER YIN
dialog: Yes. A great man. You ungrateful
dialog: little cur, you will sit here
dialog: without food until you appreciate
dialog: your namesake.
dialog: (to the other boys)
dialog: All of you will sit with him. Put
dialog: lunch away, Mr. Fong.
text: MR. FONG, the orphanage cook, wheels a FOOD CART into the kitchen and

text: A HUNDRED BOYS staring at Michael Quinn.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
text: Again, Father Yin stands before Michael Quinn. The boys are seated for their

speaker_heading: FATHER YIN
dialog: What is your name, boy?
text: Silence. Michael Quinn stares straight ahead.
speaker_heading: FATHER YIN
dialog: Put supper away, Mr. Fong.
text: MR. FONG wheels the FOOD CART into the kitchen and locks the door. Again,
dialog: a hundred boys stare at Michael Quinn.
scene_heading: INT . ORPHANAGE BUNKROOM - NIGHT
text: A long, narrow room with bunkbeds. The boys aren't sleeping. They're
text: grouped around Michael Quinn's bunk. One boy has his hand clamped to

scene_heading: INT. ORPHANAGE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BUNKROOM - NIGHT
dialog: Fathers O'Neal and Yin watch through the door.
speaker_heading: FATHER YIN
dialog: Spareth the rod, spoileth the child.
scene_heading: INT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING
text: Father Yin grits his teeth, staring down at Michael Quinn, whose face is
dialog: welted. Nothing has changed.
speaker_heading: FATHER YIN
dialog: Put breakfast away, Mr. Fong.
dialog: 
text: Again, the FOOD CART goes into the kitchen. The Fathers and Mr. Fong exit.
text: The boys rise, moving toward Michael Quinn. They're going to kick the living
dialog: shit out of him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL QUINN
dialog: Stop. You'll have your breakfast.
text: Michael Quinn walks to the locked kitchen door.
dialog: The other boys, curious, follow.
text: Michael Quinn kneels before the door, examining the lock. He looks around.
text: On a counter next to the door are EATING UTENSILS. Michael Quinn picks up
text: A FORK. He bends the fork's tines. Inserts it in the lock.
text: He fishes around for a second. Nothing happens. He pulls the fork out,
text: rebends it, and inserts it in the lock again. And CLICK.. ..the lock pops.
text: Michael Quinn turns and smiles. The boys flood inside.
text: The hungry boys go for the food cart, scooping up eggs and sausage. They're
text: ravenous. Francis, mouth full of sausage, beams at Michael Quinn.
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: They should've named you Simon, like
dialog: Simon Magus the sorcerer.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL QUINN
dialog: No. Simon. . . .

dialog: Father O'Neal and Father Yin enter quickly.
text: The boys back away from the food cart.
speaker_heading: FATHER YIN
dialog: Who.. . who did this...?
dialog: The boys look at Michael Quinn. Then Francis speaks:
speaker_heading: FRANCIS
dialog: I did father.
dialog: And another boy, James:
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: I did father. .
dialog: And another and another: "I did father." They all say it. And the littlest

speaker_heading: SPEAKER (o.s.)
dialog: In I917 Lenin stood here and

dialog: years in our history.
text: THE SPEAKER stands on a platform behind a cluster of microphones, his
text: image projected on a huge screen (like the Sony screen in Times Square)
dialog: above and behind him.
text: He is MICHAEL ROMANOV, coal-haired, fierce, ardent, eyes glinting like onyx,
dialog: voice cutting the night air.
speaker_heading: ROMANOV
dialog: In 1987 Gorbachev stood here and
dialog: promised a new age. The result? An
dialog: end to communism. Democracy. A
dialog: free economy. And what else?
dialog: Chaos.
speaker_heading: (crowd CHEERS)
dialog: The economy run by criminals, the
dialog: government run by charlatans. And
dialog: they are in league together!
dialog: Thieves! Traitors!
speaker_heading: (louder CHEERS)
dialog: Men and women of St. Petersburg,
dialog: citizens of Russia, the salt of this

speaker_heading: (deafening CHEERS)
dialog: Join me then in the song of our
dialog: forefathers.
dialog: Romanov begins to sing, ably, the first verse of "Mother Russia"

text: THE CROWD joins him. The Ploshchad rings with the voices of half a million
dialog: Russians...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - NIKKO HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
dialog: We're 12 stories up, outside the city's Nikko hotel.
text: The rally across town is a distant glow.
dialog: We hear the singing crowd.
text: TWO HANDS appear, gripping the nooks of the exterior architecture. A MAN
text: IN BLACK climbs up, securing a sling to the window frame in which to sit. A
text: bulky BACKPACK hangs from shoulder straps.
text: He produces a diamond cutter; begins carving a man-sized aperture in the
dialog: window. Below, in the foyer 
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM
text: -- A JAPANESE SECURITY MAN sits at his guard station, watching C.N.N.
text: NEWS on a small television. Wolf Blitzer is reporting live from the rally.
speaker_heading: WOLF BLITZER
dialog: (on t.v.)
dialog: An extraordinary allegation,
dialog: Bernard, that Russia's present
dialog: leadership, including President
dialog: Victor Karpov, is connected with the
dialog: country's underworld.
text: Inside the foyer ballroom, Japanese businessmen are hosting a reception. The
dialog: Nikko Hotel's core is hollow, like the Hilton in New York; thus, the ballroom's
dialog: "ceiling" is 12 stories up.
text: CHAMPAGNE SERVERS are passing out glasses. A grey-haired Japanese
text: businessman, HIRO MYAKI, clinks his glass. The guests pay attention.
dialog: During this we focus on a CHAMPAGNE SERVER moving toward the lobby
dialog: elevators with a full tray.
speaker_heading: HIRO MYAKI

scene_heading: EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - EXTERIOR WALL
text: ...the Man In Black kicks at the cut section of window, pushing it into the

scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE
text: The Man In Black catches hold of a steel girder and dangles, and,
dialog: miraculously --
dialog: THE PIECE OF WINDOW doesn't fall.
text: It's stuck to his feet with suction cups.
text: The Man In Black moves, hand over hand, toward the mezzanine balcony, the
dialog: window stuck to his feet.
speaker_heading: IN THE LOBBY BELOW
text: Everybody's beaming, toasting, congratulating, etc., totally oblivious to THE
text: MAN IN BLACK, 12 stories up, inching hand-over-hand across the roof
dialog: superstructure.
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE OVER MEZZANINE
dialog: The Man In Black has reached the mezzanine.
text: TWO JAPANESE SECURITY GUARDS, armed with automatic rifles, walk their
text: shift directly below him. They pass a wall mounted television, also carrying
dialog: the NEWS:
speaker_heading: WOLF BLITZER
dialog: (on t.v.)
dialog: One thing's certain, Bernard:
dialog: Michael Romanov, age 32, French born
dialog: and Oxford educated, descendent of
dialog: the last czar, is a political force
dialog: to be reckoned with.
text: The guards move down the mezzanine; one jokes, the other laughs. They
dialog: disappear around a corner.
text: The Man in Black hangs from the girder with one hand; with the other he
text: yanks the piece of window off his foot-mounted suction cups.
text: He drops to the mezzanine. He rests the glass against the wall. He peers over
text: the balustrade at the party below. Satisfied, he removes his hood, ENDING TITLES.
dialog: This is SIMON TEMPLAR. A hard, self-reliant, crafty man. You should treat him
dialog: as such or be very sorry you ever met him. It is unfortunate that a man of
dialog: Templar's various talents can be so lacking. How?
dialog: His journey has been through a tough world and he has come fast. This one
text: gives no quarter. Ever. Though his outward self glows with life, he is dead inside.
dialog: Templar, focused utterly, steals inside a corridor.
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR
text: A long corridor with a door at the end, on which is engraved: MYAKI
text: CORPORATION. At the entrance, secured in a niche, is a BRONZE BUST OF
speaker_heading: HIRO MYAKI.
text: Templar stops cold. A RUG (an oriental runner) extends the length of the
dialog: corridor.
text: Templar kneels, lifting an edge of the rug.
speaker_heading: Revealing ANTI -THEFT PRESSURE SENSORS.
text: Templar produces a DARTGUN (the size of a flare gun, silenced, with a spool
text: of steel cable attached to the top). He aims down the corridor and fires.
text: A STEEL DART explodes from the barrel, spooling out the cable, and imbeds
text: above the door at corridor's end.
text: Templar yanks the other end of cable from the spool. He looks around for
dialog: something to secure it.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Sorry about this.
text: He ties the cable around Myaki's bronze neck.
text: He hangs from the cable, testing it. It will hold.
text: He pulls out an aluminum contraption with small wheels and two handle grips.
dialog: It's A GLIDER for the cable.
text: He attaches the glider to the cable, grips the handles, and glides the length of
dialog: the corridor.
scene_heading: THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR - OVER THE DOOR
text: Templar bumps up against the door. He pulls his knees up and over the
text: handles of the glider, then flops over backwards, hanging upside down.
text: HIS FACE is now right next to the door handle, over which is an ELECTRONIC
dialog: LOCK (opened by punching a code).
dialog: Templar pulls out a BLACK BOX. It's a really small, really powerful computer
dialog: and its job is to run through every possible number combination in about a
text: minute and a half. Templar wires the computer to the lock with two needlelike
speaker_heading: ELECTRODE PROBES.
text: He activates the system. The little computer starts running through
text: combinations of numbers. He waits, hanging upside down. Meanwhile--
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE - ELEVATOR LOBBY
text: The Japanese guards are smoking by the elevator, joking, laughing. One of
dialog: these guys is a riot...
text: The elevator opens. The CHAMPAGNE SERVER comes out, tray in hand.
speaker_heading: CHAMPAGNE SERVER
dialog: Compliments of Mr. Myaki.
speaker_heading: JAPANESE GUARDS
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Ahh!
text: Beaming, they each take a glass. They clink and drink.
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR
dialog: The computer BEEPS. It's finished.
text: Templar turns the door handle; pushes open the door.
text: He pulls himself up. Hangs from his hands again.
text: He swings his legs back and forth, getting momentum up.
text: He releases from the glider and lunges inside.
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES
text: A grand boardroom with Japanese furniture and art.
text: At the end of a fifty-foot mahogany table is a PAINTING OF HIRO MYAKI.
dialog: Templar walks over to it.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Sorry again.
text: He RIPS the painting off the wall and heaves it aside.
dialog: And here, where the painting was, is A SAFE.
text: Templar unshoulders his backpack. He pulls out a 40-pound CARLSBAD &
dialog: RINKER industrial diamond-tipped drill, as big as a jackhammer. No finesse
dialog: here, people.
dialog: No, there's no time for high-tech. He's going to drill right through the bitch,
text: right through four inches of tungsten steel. He starts setting up the drill.
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE LOBBY
text: Two CHAMPAGNE GLASSES lie shattered on the floor, and next to that mess
text: lie the JAPANESE GUARDS, now unconscious. The champagne server's
dialog: gone...
speaker_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE
text: ...because he's here, moving quickly toward the Myaki Corporation's office,
dialog: and he's not a champagne server, but a thief and a killer, a blonde Russian
speaker_heading: named ILYA.
text: Ilya stops just outside the interior corridor. With the GUARD'S KEYRING, he
text: shuts off the anti-theft mats and moves around the corner into the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR
text: Ilya stops short. His eyes spark.
dialog: He sees Templar's cable and glider.
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MYAKI CORPORATION OFFICES
text: Templar, wearing goggles, leans into the drill as THE BIT CHEWS into the
text: tungsten lock. This is a violent exercise. SINEWS OF METAL spit out like
dialog: shrapnel.
text: He's through the lock in seconds. Templar heaves the drill aside; it lands with
text: a THUD on the beautiful mahogany table. He opens the safe.
text: INSIDE THE SAFE is one object: A SMALL BOX, the size of a cufflink keeper.
text: Templar grabs it and opens it.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE LITTLE BOX is a tiny MICRO-CHIP.
text: Templar closes the box and pockets it.
speaker_heading: ILYA (v.o.)
dialog: Don't move.
text: Templar freezes. His eyes twitch.
dialog: This wasn't in the plan...
speaker_heading: ILYA (v.o.)
dialog: Turn around. Slowly.
text: Templar faces Ilya. Ilya has a silenced handgun.
speaker_heading: ILYA
dialog: On your knees.
dialog: (Templar sinks to his knees)
dialog: Give me the box. Slowly.
text: Templar pulls out the box. Tosses it to Ilya.
text: Ilya raises the handgun at Templar's head. Smiles.
dialog: Try something: throw an extension cord on the ground. I guarantee it will
dialog: land coiled in several places.
text: Ilya happens to be standing inside one of the coils of the drill's extension
dialog: cord.
dialog: And this is not lost on Templar.
text: Templar, on his knees, grabs the cord and yanks it; the coil tightens around
text: Ilya's ankles. His legs fly from under him and he goes down, the gun
text: clattering across the floor.
text: Ilya tries to get to his feet.
dialog: Templar floors him with a right cross.
text: Templar grabs the box and his backpack and sprints across the room. Ilya
text: gains his feet and grabs his gun; sprints after Templar.
speaker_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE
text: Templar runs to the balustrade and climbs atop it.
text: He jumps, clutching the ceiling girder above.
dialog: He's going out the way he came in.
text: Suddenly ILYA'S HANDS are around his ankles.
text: Templar falls. He's going 12 stories to his death.
text: No. His fingers clutch the outside of the balustrade. Templar dangles there,
text: looking up at the sadistic face of Ilya. And suddenly below --
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM
text: -- A JAPANESE WOMAN, looking up, pointing at the man dangling from the
text: balustrade above, SCREAMS. And now everybody looks up.
speaker_heading: HIRO MYAKI
dialog: Sound the alarm! Call the police!
speaker_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - MEZZANINE
text: Ilya and Templar. Ilya calmly compresses his foot against Templar's left
dialog: knuckles.
speaker_heading: ILYA
dialog: The box please.
text: Templar, grimacing, reaches with his right hand and pulls the box from his
text: pocket. Hands it slowly to Ilya, who reaches over the balustrade for it...
text: TEMPLAR stuffs the box in his teeth and grabs Ilya's hand, jerking him over
dialog: the balustrade.
dialog: Ilya falls 12 stories to his death.
text: No he doesn't. He falls one story and miraculously catches the balustrade
dialog: there.
text: Templar clambers up again, atop the balustrade.
text: He jumps to the ceiling girder.
text: Hand over hand, swinging like an acrobat, Templar's across the girder in
dialog: seconds.
text: He releases from the girder to the window frame.
text: There's one further problem. BULLETS. Ricocheting all around him. Fired by --
dialog: ILYA, one floor down.
text: Templar reaches over his shoulder. Pulls a GUN from his backpack. To return
dialog: fire? No, it's the DART GUN.
text: Templar aims the dart gun out the aperture he cut in the window and fires.
speaker_heading: EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - 12TH FLOOR
text: A STEEL DART launches from the window, flies fifty yards, and imbeds in the
text: STAIRCASE BULKHEAD OF THE BUILDING ADJACENT TO THE NIKKO.
scene_heading: INT. NIKKO HOTEL - CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE
text: Templar ties the cable to the ceiling girder.
text: He pulls out his black hood and drapes it over the taught cable. He grabs both
dialog: ends of the hood.
dialog: And he jumps.
scene_heading: EXT. NIKKO HOTEL/ADJACENT BUILDING
text: Templar flies through space, across the cable, the hood acting as a makeshift
dialog: glider.
text: He lands on the roof of the adjacent building.
dialog: Templar looks around. SIRENS ARE WAILING.
text: He runs across rooftops, disappearing into the St. Petersburg night.
scene_heading: INT . NIKKO HOTEL - GRAND FOYER BALLROOM
dialog: Total chaos. Women screaming, everybody running around. Ilya comes
dialog: through the panicked crowd.
text: Ten ST. PETERSBURG POLICEMEN enter.
speaker_heading: ILYA
dialog: I tried to stop him! He went out
dialog: the window!
text: Five policemen go for the elevators. Five more exit quickly. Ilya follows.
speaker_heading: EXT. NIKKO HOTEL - ENTRANCE
text: The befuddled police race off, looking skyward at the top floors of the
dialog: building.
text: Ilya curses silently. And peels away from the cops and commotion, off into
dialog: the night.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: INT. A BRITISH-AIR 747 - MORNING

speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Newspaper sir?
text: SIMON TEMPLAR sits there, dressed as usual without much heed to fashion.
dialog: Note this, reader: Templar is not a super-spy, super-hero, or super-rake. He

speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: (Cockney)
dialog: Wow, are those gorgeous or what...
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: You have an eye for beauty. Of course - you see it every time you

speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Why thank-you, Mr...

dialog: The plane has landed.
text: PASSENGERS are filing out past the Stewardess.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Goodbye, goodbye, enjoy your stay in London, etc.
text: Templar moves past the Stewardess, carrying TWO CARRY-ON BAGS. He
text: winks at her. She winks back, and fingers one of the RUSSIAN LOCKETS, now
dialog: around her neck.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Good-bye, Mr. Templar.
text: As Templar moves off, she smiles to herself and CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LONDON - HEATHROW AIRPORT
text: Templar walks briskly away from customs.
text: A MAN IN TRENCHCOAT falls in behind Templar.
text: TWO MEN appear in front of Templar, blocking his path; the man behind

speaker_heading: INSPECTOR MACDUFF
dialog: How's the weather in St. Petersburg?
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Cold.
speaker_heading: INSPECTOR MACDUFF
dialog: Let's warm things up for you.

scene_heading: INT. HEATHROW CUSTOMS - INTERROGATION ROOM
text: A spartan room, a table and two chairs. MacDuff ransacks TEMPLAR'S BAGS
dialog: while, across the room --

speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: He's clean.

dialog: Yes. Very.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: It's for protection.

dialog: Templar's passport)
dialog: What's your nationality this week,

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: I forget.
speaker_heading: MACDUFF
dialog: (looks at passport)
dialog: Issued by the Principality
dialog: of.. . Yemen? You're bloody joking.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR

speaker_heading: MACDUFF
dialog: Shut it.

dialog: you didn't fence it in Russia. Where is it?
text: The door opens. Teal enters, tossing several X-RAY PHOTOGRAPHS on the
text: table before MacDuff. Two are of Templar's bags, two are of his body.
speaker_heading: TEAL
dialog: (Cockney)
dialog: All negative. He didn't swallow it.
dialog: An embarrassing pause.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: You've got three options: charge me,
dialog: or release me.
speaker_heading: MACDUFF
dialog: What's the third.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: You can kiss my ass.
text: A dreadful pause. MacDuff smiles.
text: He turns away, then turns back and viciously backhands Templar across the
dialog: face; Templar's head jerks. The blow would knock most men out.
dialog: Now Templar smiles. Like a serpant. And says calmly:
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: I'm a busy man. Make up your mind.
text: MacDuff stares at Templar, gritting his teeth.
text: Templar rises. Begins collecting his things.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LONDON RESTAURANT - EVENING
text: A quaint place off Piccadilly. The STEWARDESS (from Templar's flight) gulps a

speaker_heading: STEWARDESS

speaker_heading: STEWARDESS

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Back there. Leave your locket.
dialog: I'll polish it for you.
text: She smiles crookedly; hands over the locket.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Are you a dearheart or what...
text: She blows Templar a kiss and lurches off to the bathroom. Templar watches
dialog: her a moment.
text: When she's gone he puts the locket on the table.
text: He pries open the back of it with a pen-knife.
text: INSERT - THE LOCKET - there is a compartment in which sits THE STOLEN
text: MICRO-CHIP. Templar plucks out the chip and drops it into an envelope.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE - FOLLOWING THE STEWARDESS
text: as she returns to the table. She sits down. Looks around. Templar's gone. The
text: locket's gone. The waitress appears.
speaker_heading: STEWARDESS
dialog: Maam, where's the gent who was
dialog: sitting 'ere?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: He left, luv. Said you'd take care

text: She sinks down, confused, blinking, near tears. CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LONDON - MUSGRAVE HOTEL
text: A small, plush, discrete residential hotel in the heart of Mayfair (Regent Street, Grovesnor Sq. or equivalent). TEMPLAR approaches the front desk with his carry-on bags. CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON and the HOTEL MANAGER are behind the desk.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON
dialog: Mr. Templar! Good to see you sir.
dialog: Your room key - south penthouse as
dialog: usual. Your suits are up from storage,

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Thanks Harry. Oh, and Harry...

dialog: .. . ship this by overnight courier to that address.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON
dialog: Very good sir.
text: JIMMY, a young Bellman, takes Ternplar's bags. Templar doesn't let go. An
dialog: uncomfortable pause.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON
dialog: Jimmy, Mr. Templar carries his own bags.
text: Templar steps past Jimmy into the elevator.
speaker_heading: JIMMY THE BELLMAN
dialog: What's with the bags, gov'nuh?
speaker_heading: HOTEL MANAGER
dialog: They're all he ever brings. The
dialog: man's bills are paid by a bank in

text: The phone RINGS. Templar eyes it skeptically. He picks it up.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Yes.
dialog: A voice with an Eastern European accent:
speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: It depends.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: A meeting. Midnight, Blackfriars

dialog: beyond.
dialog: Templar enters from Victoria Embankment.
text: TWO FIGURES emerge from the fog. Templar approaches.
text: One is a huge dim-wit with greasy hair, as tall and wide as a bookcase. His
dialog: name, aptly, is ZERO.
text: The other is middle-aged and strongly built. A high forehead; clipped, irongrey
text: hair; square jaw and aquiline nose; deep-set, ruthless, unblinking eyes.
dialog: This is GREGOR TRETIAK. To characterize him as the John Gotti of Russia is to
dialog: demean him. He is vastly more powerful.
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: Interesting.
dialog: (sizes up Templar)
dialog: You are not a big man. But men like
dialog: you never are. It is my pleasure,
dialog: Simon Templar. My name is...
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: I know who you are. Tell me what
dialog: you want, or I keep walking.
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: Suppose I don't want anything.
dialog: Suppose I want to kill you.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Suppose there's a high-powered rifle
dialog: trained at your head.
text: As Tretiak's eyes dart about, Templar raises his hand, waving, signaling to
dialog: someone below the bridge --
scene_heading: BELOW THE BRIDGE - ON THE VICTORIA EMBANKMENT
dialog: -- that someone is CONCIERGE HARRY WINSTON, in a cloth cap and rain
text: mack now, and yes, he has a 30.6 scoped rifle trained at Tretiak's head.
text: BACK TO THE BRIDGE Tretiak's jaw muscles twitch. He smiles thinly.
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: Rumour has not lied about you, Mr.
dialog: Templar. Last night something was
dialog: stolen in St. Petersburg. My city.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: You talk about the place as if you
dialog: own it.
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: (sinisterly)
dialog: I do, Mr. Templar. May I ask who hired you?
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: You can ask. I won't answer.
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: What you stole I wanted very badly.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ilya.
text: Ilya emerges from the shadows.
dialog: Locks eyes with Templar. The thief from the Nikko!
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: What is the saying - if you can't
dialog: beat them, why not join them?
dialog: An American phrase, no? Or are you
dialog: British? Australian?
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: I'm nothing. Except bored.
dialog: Get to the point.
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Of course. An American scientist
dialog: has worked ten years to develop a
dialog: certain technology. I am informed
dialog: that the technology will be made
dialog: public at the annual nuclear science
dialog: symposium in Washington D.C. I
dialog: would like the plans and
dialog: specifications for this technology. Before the symposium.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: What are we talking about?
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: A nuclear fusion generator. We have
dialog: a man on the inside.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Why can't he steal it?
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: He's tried. The scientist trusts no
dialog: one and keeps no hard records of the
dialog: technology in the lab.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Nuclear fusion. They say it's
dialog: mankind's only hope after all the
dialog: oil's gone. This guy's actually done it?
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: She.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Come again?
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: She, Mr. Templar. The scientist is a woman.
dialog: (hands over a dossier)
dialog: Her dossier. All the information

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: My fee is fifteen million U.S.

speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: Templar, one question.

speaker_heading: TRETIAK

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Hello again. These aren't ripe.
dialog: How are the apples?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Excellent. They're in season.

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: I wonder why He didn't want us to eat these.
text: A pause. She looks at him, puzzled.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: God. In the Garden of Eden.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Oh right. Sorry, little slow today.
dialog: Bad headache.
dialog: (looks at the apple)
dialog: Uhm, actually, I don't know.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Why wasn't it: "No bananas." Or:
dialog: "Avoid, at all cost, kumquats."
dialog: Wonder what God had against apples.
text: She gives him a funny look and turns away.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Sorry. Can't help you.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: How about William Tell? You really
dialog: think he shot one of these off his
dialog: brother's head with an arrow?
text: Jillian turns around again. A pause.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Do I know you?
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Unlikely. I just moved to New York.
text: She stares at him. This is a very strange man.
text: Intriguing yes, but also possibly a lunatic. She decides to take the dismissive

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Well uhhm, sir, to answer your apple
dialog: questions, one, I don't know what
dialog: God's problem was. Two, William

speaker_heading: VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette)
dialog: Nuclear fusion occurs when pairs of

speaker_heading: BACK TO SCENE - JILLIAN

text: At this, Templar stares at the tape cassette.
speaker_heading: VIJAY SINGH (v.o., cassette)

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Try room temperature, idiot.

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Not a one.
dialog: They walk toward the mansion.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Well, that's a start. Here's the

dialog: children because one has to have sex
dialog: to do that and, well, let's not

dialog: want to be a cheerleader, or drink
dialog: 'till she pukes every weekend, or
dialog: talk endlessly on the phone every

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: College?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Try earning double p.h.d.'s

dialog: and having a social life.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Can I ask a personal question?
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: What's your I.Q.?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: That's personal? My I.Q.?
dialog: Let's just say it's high.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Very high.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Yes, very high. As high as yours.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: You don't honestly mean that.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Oh, you're a smart one, shoemaker.
dialog: It's in the eyes. I can always tell.
text: They stare at each other. Neither averts eyes.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: I just don't often get
dialog: the opportunity. It feels nice.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: For me, too.
dialog: (and he means this:)
dialog: You're very pretty.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Stop it. Flattery will get you...
dialog: someplace. I don't know where yet.
text: She smiles. The waiter arrives with the check; gives it to Templar. Jillian picks
text: up her purse and takes her wallet out. Templar sees her doing this...
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: No no no, absolutely not.
dialog: Put that away.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: It's not for us. It's for the couple over there.
dialog: (points at the couple across the room)
dialog: Waiter, put their bill on my card please.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Maam? Are you sure?
text: Jillian nods. The waiter takes Jillian's card, exits.
dialog: Jillian smiles at Templar. [Due to his mean origins and evolution, Templar has witnessed approximately three charitable acts in his whole life, and this was
dialog: the third.] Thus does Simon Templar smile uneasily back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - JILLIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Neat, modest, non-descript. Jillian and Templar enter. Jillian walks across the

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: I'll make the booze.
dialog: Turn on the news. I want to catch up on that
dialog: Russia thing.
text: Templar turns on the T.V. His eyes rove around, casing the place.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN (o.s.)
dialog: What do you want, Michael?
dialog: I've got everything.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Scotch please. No ice.

text: A PHOTO OF IVAN GRACHA, 50's, short, beady-eyed, sinister, appears on the

text: JILLIAN pokes her head out of the bar.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: What brand?
speaker_heading: BERNARD SHAW (o.s.)
dialog: ...allegedly the most powerful of

text: JILLIAN walks over to Templar. They watch together.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: It very well might. Oban.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: What? .
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: My brand of scotch.
dialog: Oban. Have any?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: No, but there's a liquor store

text: She grabs her coat, heads for the door.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Wait. Don't be ridiculous.
text: She stops. Looks at him.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: I want to be ridiculous.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Michael, I haven't had anybody

dialog: happen to like you. I want to do
dialog: this right. Okay?
dialog: (he smiles; nods)
dialog: I'll be back in ten minutes.
dialog: (points at fireplace)
dialog: Build a fire.
text: She winks at him and exits.
text: Templar walks to the window and stands there, waiting.
dialog: We hear Jillian's car start, see the headlights.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: You're making this too
dialog: easy, dear.
text: He pulls from his pocket a BLACK CASE, flips it open, turns it on. On a
text: miniature computer screen is a detailed map of WESTCHESTER COUNTY. Two
dialog: locations are pulsing: 1) Jillian's house and 2) a moving object, transmitted
dialog: from a homing device, which we now see 
speaker_heading: INT. JILLIAN' S CAR - DRIVING
text: -- it's in JILLIAN'S SHOE as she stamps on the brake at a stoplight and waits
dialog: and we CUT BACK to the house...
scene_heading: INT. JILLIAN' SHOUSE - BACK HALLWAY
text: TEMPLAR moves down the hall opening doors, looking for Jillian's lab. He
text: moves quickly, ruthlessly.
text: He comes to a heavily locked FIRE DOOR. He unpockets a set of burglar's
dialog: tools.
dialog: For Templar, these locks are a joke. He opens them with alarming speed. He
text: pushes open the door, revealing a DESCENDING STAIRCASE. He descends.
scene_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BASMENT
text: Templar finds a lightswitch and flips it on.
dialog: His eyes widen. Here we find --
text: JILLIAN'S LABORATORY. A POOL OF WATER (the size of a small swimming
text: pool) is surrounded by HUNDREDS OF TEST TUBES of various shapes and
dialog: sizes containing chemicals.
text: Templar moves through, eyes scanning everything.
text: He sees JILLIAN'S COMPUTER. Walks over to it.
text: He unpockets the HOMING SYSTEM and sets it on the desk.
text: The PULSING LIGHT is still moving; Jillian hasn't yet reached the liquor store.
text: He turns on Jillian's monitor and hard drive. The COMPUTER SCREEN blinks
dialog: on. We see a MENU:
dialog: A.) Personal finances
dialog: B.) Income tax
dialog: C.) Things to do
dialog: D.) Addresses
dialog: E.) Research
dialog: Templar positions the cursor on "E.) Research" and hits "enter." The modem
dialog: engages; this appears:
scene_heading: ******* WELCOME TO THE INTERNET *******
speaker_heading: PLEASE WAIT
dialog: Then this appears: RETRIEVAL CODE: _____________________
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Smart girl. Send your data into
dialog: cyberspace and only you can retrieve
dialog: it. Because only you have the code.
dialog: He unpockets the 3 1/4 disk containing the data from Jillian's life and pushes
text: it into the disk drive. He types a command; a new screen appears:
speaker_heading: DATA ENTRY SYSTEM
dialog: Press any key to begin
dialog: Templar hits a key and the old screen reappears:
scene_heading: ******* WELCOME TO THE INTERNET *******
speaker_heading: PLEASE WAIT
dialog: RETRIEVAL CODE: ______________________
dialog: But now, in the space next to "Retrieval Code," Templar's data appears. word

dialog: -- "Bulldogs"
speaker_heading: -- Computer: ACCESS DENIED
text: It's incredibly fast, a new word appearing every second, as the system tries to
dialog: crack Jillian's code. But the computer denies access to each word.
text: The HOMING DEVICE suddenly BEEPS. The pulsing light has stopped,
text: indicating Jillian is at the liquor store.
text: Templar grimly turns back to the computer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WESTCHESTER LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
dialog: The clerk, WALTER, hands Jillian her change.

scene_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S LABORATORY - NIGHT

dialog: ACCESS DENIED. "Celtics." ACCESS DENIED. On and on...each is met with
speaker_heading: ACCESS DENIED.
scene_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S STATION WAGON - DRIVING - NIGHT
text: Jillian, driving, turns on the radio. She hums along.
speaker_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S LABORATORY
text: Templar stares at the HOMING DEVICE; the pulse is getting closer; it's do or
dialog: die now...
text: Templar's system suddenly stops. It has run through every word. Each has
dialog: met with failure.
text: TEMPLAR frowns. He yanks the system disk from the disk drive. He begins
dialog: pacing...
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Okay, think. Think.
dialog: Templar suddenly gets an idea.
text: He sits and types: "Tokamak." ACCESS DENIED Templar stares at the screen
dialog: in frustration.
text: He looks at the HOMING DEVICE; the pulsing light is getting really close.
dialog: Templar concentrates with every brain cell.
dialog: We can feel him think. He's remembering something.
speaker_heading: MEMORY FLASHBACK
dialog: We're in Jillian's car again, when they first met.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Try room temperature, idiot.
dialog: The Tokamak's got it all backwards.
speaker_heading: BACK TO THE LABORATORY
dialog: Templar grabs a pencil and notepad and spells out:
dialog: TOKAMAK. Under this he spells it backwards: KAMAKOT.
dialog: He turns to the computer and types: "KAMAKOT" And instantly this flashes:
speaker_heading: ACCESS GRANTED.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Open sesame.
dialog: The retrieval begins: A DOCUMENT appears on the screen:
scene_heading: THE GENERATION OF ENERGY FROM COLD NUCLEAR FUSION
speaker_heading: Submitted by: DR. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS
text: Templar scrolls through the document; we see a dizzying display of graphs,
dialog: tables, plans, specifications, etc.
text: Templar pulls out the disk containing Jillian's data and shoves a fresh disk
text: into the disk drive. He begins copying Jillian's research from harddrive to disk.
dialog: He looks at the HOMING DEVICE. Christ, she's almost back.. .and indeed --
speaker_heading: EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE
text: -- Jillian's car comes wheeling into the driveway.
scene_heading: INT. JILLIAN' S LABORATORY - NIGHT
text: The document is copied. Templar grabs the copied disk from the disk drive
text: and rips the slip of paper from the notepad. He flicks off the computer and
text: sprints across the lab, then up the stairs.
speaker_heading: EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE
dialog: Jillian reaches for the doorknob and enters --
speaker_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE
text: She comes in. TEMPLAR, relaxed, lounges on the couch, flipping through some magazines.
dialog: He smiles:
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: That was quick.
text: She walks past him to the bar alcove.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Now Mr. Michael Quinn, let's have
dialog: that scotch. Hey, what happened
dialog: to the fire?
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: I thought we'd create our own.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Down boy.
text: He gets up; goes to the fireplace; grabs some logs and lays them across the
dialog: andirons and we --
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: THE LOGS, now gently burning. Cole Porter is playing.
text: CAMERA PANS past Jillian's shoes on the carpet, past the Oban Scotch on the
dialog: coffee table, now half empty, to --
text: -- the couch, where Jillian and Templar are locked in a heavy kiss. Jillian stops.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Whoah whoah whoah, time to put
dialog: on the brakes. Those lips oughtta be
dialog: licensed buddy...
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Sorry. I wasn't trying to...
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: I know you weren't but if we keep
dialog: going I'm gonna be the one who gets us
dialog: both in trouble. Whew!
dialog: (fans herself)
dialog: Haven't felt like that for awhile.
dialog: (she brushes a lock of hair from his eyes)
dialog: Am I going to see you again?
text: A pause. Perhaps, just perhaps, for the first time in his black life Templar's having a hard time lying...
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Michael?
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: (smiles at her)
dialog: How about breakfast?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: It's a date. I'll walk you
dialog: out, shoemaker.
speaker_heading: EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: In the threshold they kiss again.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Good-night.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN

dialog: On the Nevsky Prospect, St. Petersburg's equivalent of the Champs-Elysees 
text: MICHAEL ROMANOV stands on a raised platform outside the gates of a
text: PALATIAL MANSION taking up a whole city block. TEN THOUSAND
text: SUPPORTERS surround him. Many carry large, slogan-filled banners.
text: Four THUGGISH-LOOKING MEN stand guard inside the mansion's compound,

dialog: Bridge).
speaker_heading: MICHAEL ROMANOV
dialog: Where is Russia's capital? Moscow? The Kremlin? No, Russia's capital is...
dialog: (points at mansion)
speaker_heading: THROUGH THOSE GATES!
speaker_heading: (crowd CHEERS)
dialog: A den of thieves!
text: A LIMOUSINE pulls through the crowd, which reluctantly parts. The guards
dialog: within the compound open the gates.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL ROMANOV
dialog: And here - the Prince of Thieves!
text: GREGOR TRETIAK sits in the back of the limousine, silently glaring at
text: Romanov. The limousine rolls inside the compound, the gates CLANGING
dialog: shut.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL ROMANOV
dialog: Every citizen in St. Petersburg
dialog: knows what that man does, yet the
dialog: police don't arrest him. They
dialog: protect him! How can this be?
dialog: Maybe we should ask our elected
dialog: whores in Moscow!
text: The CROWD CHEERS WILDLY and starts hurling rocks, bottles, etc, through
dialog: the gate at --
text: -- TRETIAK, emerging from the limousine. Tretiak's guards surround him;
text: they move quickly up the mansion's marble steps, dodging the thrown debris.
text: SIRENS WAIL. Four large police vans roar up, the back doors flinging open.
text: ST. PETERSBURG POLICE, in riot gear, deploy from the vans.
text: The police push into the crowd, wielding riot shields and batons. A melee
dialog: breaks out, Romanov supporters versus the police.
scene_heading: INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - EVENING
text: Tretiak and his men move past A GUARD STATION manned by TWO GUARDS
text: watching six SURVEILLANCE MONITORS (showing, at all times, certain areas of. the compound).
dialog: This is a former nobleman's residence; a 20 foot diameter CRYSTAL
text: CHANDELIER hangs from the domed roof fifty feet above. A spectacular
text: staircase ascends to a mezzanine, with offices (formerly bed chambers) off it.
text: Tretiak approaches a man in a lab coat, ZUBOV, wearing a grim, anxious
dialog: expression. Zubov chainsmokes constantly.
speaker_heading: ZUBOV
dialog: There's a problem.
dialog: Tretiak follows Zubov down stairs into --
scene_heading: INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - BASEMENT LABORATORY
text: -- a large room with TECHNICIANS hunched over computers.
text: Tretiak follows Zubov to a large bank of computers.
speaker_heading: ZUBOV
dialog: (indicates computer)
dialog: This is the data your thief sent us.
text: Tretiak looks at Zubov's COMPUTER SCREEN.
dialog: INSERT - THE COMPUTER SCREEN. Again we see:

speaker_heading: DR. JILLIAN ST. THOMAS
speaker_heading: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Cold fusion?
speaker_heading: ZUBOV
text: Yes. Fusion at room temperature. Regarded as an impossibility by the scientific community. A myth.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Then I read this.
text: Zubov begins scrolling through the document; again we see the displav of graphs. tables. plans. Specs.. etc.
speaker_heading: ZUBOV
dialog: She first proves why hot fusion - the tokamak - is impractical. You must heat the hydrogen gases so high, more energy is wasted than created. Here she goes into the benefits of cold fusion.
dialog: (scrolls more pages)
dialog: The hydrogen isotopes needed.
dialog: (scrolls more pages)
dialog: The physical plant. She even estimates its cost. Extraordinary.
dialog: (scrolls more pages)
dialog: The next pages are the critical part, what no one in fifty years has discovered.
dialog: (looks up at Tretiak)
dialog: The combination of chemicals in which atoms will fuse at room temperature.
text: Tretiak leans toward the screen, waiting.
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: Well? Let's see.
speaker_heading: ZUBOV
dialog: Tretiak - I think from reading
dialog: this that the woman's done it.
dialog: She may have found a source of
dialog: unlimited energy.
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: What do you mean
dialog: may have. Show me.
speaker_heading: ZUBOV
dialog: I said there was a problem.
text: Zubov hits the "scroll" key. The next page appears; we see the heading at the top of the page: THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION
dialog: But there's something wrong with the rest of the page.
dialog: Terribly wrong. We know this because of 
dialog: TRETIAK'S EXPRESSION, and it's not too happy.
speaker_heading: TRETIAK
dialog: Where's the rest of it?
speaker_heading: ZUBOV
dialog: It's in her head.

scene_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
text: JILLIAN, humming the Cole Porter song from the previous evening, fills a basket with breakfast for two: eggs, bagels, etc. Sunlight streams in. Birds chirping.
text: She wears jeans and her jacket with the atomic diagram embroidered on the back. She grabs flowers from a vase; tosses them in the basket. Smiles.
scene_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
text: She enters with the basket. Looks at the disheveled couch and the bottle of Oban. She hums the Cole Porter song, stabs her feet in THE SHOES TEMPLAR GAVE HER and goes to the front door.
speaker_heading: EXT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT
dialog: Jillian comes out, running into --

speaker_heading: YURI
dialog: Good morning, boss.

text: The huge estate, as before. Jillian's station wagon pulls into the circular driveway. Jillian gets out with the breakfast basket. Moves up the flagstoned walk.
text: Suddenly the front door opens. A WOMAN, mid-30's, pretty and well-dressed, comes out and locks the door.
text: JILLIAN watches her. The woman comes down the walk.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: May I help you?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you have an appointment?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: To see the house.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: The man who lives here...
dialog: who owns the house...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What man. The estate is rented
dialog: for weddings and corporate events.
dialog: Are you. ..interested...?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: No. No.
text: The rental agent gives Jillian a funny look and gets in her car. Drives off. Jillian stares at the house, thunderstruck. Then she sharply inhales:
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Oh my god. ...
dialog: Jillian gets in her car.

dialog: (calls down the hall)
dialog: Yuri!
text: She unpockets her keyring, her hands trembling uncontrollably.
scene_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LABORATORY - MORNING
text: Jillian races down the stairs and across the lab to her computer. She moves in a panic, as if in a living nightmare. She turns the computer on. She types in the code word, "kamakot," and her research paper appears on the screen. In the lower right corner it reads: LAST ENTERED: 10:23 p.m.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: No.. . ..
text: She sees something on the desk. The NOTEPAD on which Templar wrote his notes. The page is indented with Templar's pen marks; the words "tokamak" and "kamakot" are clearly visible.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: No, this can't be happening. Yuri!

speaker_heading: WOMAN (o.s.)
dialog: Is that a good system?
text: A WOMAN, 40's, dowdy and serious in an accountant-like way, has sat down across from Templar. Points at Templar's computer.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WOMAN ACCOUNTANT (o.s.)
dialog: Going to Europe?

dialog: Uhmm, I'm going for coffee.
dialog: Like some? It's really no trouble. ...
dialog: Okay lady, anything to get rid of you:
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Sure. Black please.
text: She smiles and walks off to the coffee counter, passing A BUSINESSMAN, who sits down with a steaming cup of coffee and starts reading the WALL STREET JOURNAL.
text: Templar eyes the man, then looks back at his computer.
text: He begins typing. The phone modem engages. 
dialog: Templar types: LION CONTACTING BEAR. IS BEAR HOME?

text: The Woman Accountant rises, picks up her bag.
speaker_heading: WOMAN ACCOUNTANT
dialog: Well, that's me. So long.
text: She smiles. Templar sort of smiles back. She walks off to catch her flight. THE BUSINESSMAN next to Templar, hidden behind his newspaper, sets his coffee cup down next to Templar's.
text: The Businessman flips a page, engrossed in an article.
text: He reaches back for his coffee, but takes Templar's cup.
text: He drinks from the cup.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Excuse me, that's my. . . .
text: The Businessman's newspaper is shaking. Violently. It falls to the table. The Businessman's face is flushed. He twitches. He pitches over. His head THUDS on the table.
text: Templar feels the Businessman's carotid artery. He's dead. Templar picks up his coffee and smells it. Templar's eyes dart to the lounge. The Lady Accountant is gone. Nobody in the lounge has noticed what's happened. Templar hurriedly collects his things.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: AN AIRPORT TAXI stops at the curb. Templar gets out, paying the cabbie. The taxi pulls away.

speaker_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Templar enters. No one is here. He moves through the living room into the back corridor, glancing into the kitchen, where we see that --

scene_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - LABORATORY - DAY
text: Templar comes down; he walks to the computer.
text: He looks at the document on the screen. He begins scrolling, going to the end
dialog: this time.
dialog: We see the graphs, tables, plans, specs., etc. Then the critical page appears:
speaker_heading: THE CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT FOR COLD FUSION
text: And under that. . . .. A NINTENDO GAME. Little spaceships are flying around chasing other little spaceships! TEMPLAR stares at it, stunned: what he sent the Russians is essentially worthless. Templar shuts off the monitor. The screen blackens. The black screen reflects light. It reflects A PERSON coming down the stairs. A person with a gun...
text: Templar dives away as THREE BULLETS blow the computer monitor to shards.
dialog: THE WOMAN FROM THE J.F.K. LOUNGE, not an accountant but an assassin,
dialog: draws a bead on --
text: TEMPLAR, who scrambles across the room ducking under lab tables as
text: BULLETS shatter bottles, beakers, test tubes; glass fills the air.
text: TEMPLAR stands up, his 9mm leveled at the woman.
dialog: The woman's gun is leveled at Templar. -
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: That's a Reuger nine shot.
dialog: I counted nine.
speaker_heading: FEMALE ASSASSIN
dialog: What if you're wrong.
text: The tension boils. Templar was right: her hand flashes to the gun, ejecting the spent clip. She tries to ram in a fresh clip but she's not fast enough...
text: TEMPLAR'S across the room in half a second. He presses his gun to her
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: When were you hired and for what?
dialog: I'm not in a very good mood...
text: Templar cocks the hammer. This gets her attention.
speaker_heading: FEMALE ASSASSIN
dialog: Okay. Take it easy. I was hired a week ago to take you and the woman out, and detonate the house. It was empty when I got here.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Who's your employer?
speaker_heading: FEMALE ASSASSIN
dialog: I don't ask names.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Did they have accents? Russian?
dialog: (she nods; he lowers his gun)
dialog: I'm paying you out of your contract.
dialog: Don't ask questions. What's your price?
speaker_heading: FEMALE ASSASSIN
dialog: Fifty thousand for you, fifty
dialog: for her, fifty for the house.
text: Templar pulls out his wallet, from which he unfolds three pieces of negotiable paper. Hands them to her. She examines them.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR

speaker_heading: FEMALE ASSASSIN

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR

speaker_heading: INT. JILLIAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM
text: Templar enters, looking around, thinking. He looks in the bathroom. He looks in the closet. On the floor are Jillian's footwear: sneakers, pumps, cowboy boots, etc.
dialog: Right, Templar, the shoes...
text: TEMPLAR pulls out his HOMING DEVICE and clicks it on.
speaker_heading: INSERT - HOMING DEVICE SCREEN
text: Like before, an electronic rendering of WESTCHESTER COUNTY. But no
text: pulsing light. Templar enters commands, adjusting the screen, widening it to GREATER NEW YORK. Somewhere in Queens, fairly close to the Atlantic Ocean, we see a PULSING LIGHT. But it's fixed, inert.
text: The pulsing light begins to move east, quickly.
text: Templar watches it. The pulse is moving too quickly for an automobile. And it's heading for the ocean. And it goes in the ocean!

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR

speaker_heading: BROOKS BROTHERS MAN

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR

text: Suddenly JILLIAN'S EYES are open; her hands are free and she's throwing off

text: She pushes; the wheelchair bursts forward.
text: YURI gets to his feet; the wheelchair slams against his shins. Jillian WHIPS
text: the detached armrest across Yuri's head. Yuri falls backward, dazed.
text: Jillian rolls to the emergency door, one hand yanking open the door, the other
text: grabbing a PARACHUTE from the shelf. Wind howls through the cabin.
text: Jillian gets the parachute on. Her ankles are still bound to the footrests. To
dialog: hell with it, she'll lose the wheelchair in mid-air. She pushes forward as --

text: JILLIAN yanks the rip-cord; a plume of silk spills out and Jillian and the chair
text: SLINGSHOT UP, decelerating from 120 m.p.h. to 20 m.p.h. in two seconds.
dialog: Yuri can't take the "G" force; his hands rip away from the chair. He

scene_heading: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS

dialog: Look!
dialog: Other pedestrians stop. They, too, look up at --
dialog: A PARACHUTIST (Jillian of course) descending into the heart of the city!
text: And down she comes, landing hard in the middle of an intersection. TAXIS

text: JILLIAN gets to her feet, wild-eyed and frantic, tangled in cord and parachute
dialog: silk. She looks around at --
text: CROWDS OF PEDESTRIANS staring at her.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Help me. I'm American. Police!
text: A ST. PETERSBURG POLICE CRUISER comes through the intersection to a

dialog: approaches Jillian.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - PETER AND PAUL FORTRESS CITY PARK
text: Across the Neva River from Jillian is a city park with a HUGE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF PETER THE GREAT. Under the statue, two OLD RUSSIAN GEEZERS are playing chess, smoking

text: Templar dangles 15 feet off the ground. He looks at the GEEZERS directly below. Hello there.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Sorry about this.
text: He shrugs off the parachute pack and falls, landing on the chess board,

text: Templar gets to his feet, gaining his bearings, looking for Jillian. He takes off running.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE SEDAN, DRIVING - CONTINUOUS - DAY

speaker_heading: YOUNG RUSSIAN COP
dialog: Yes. Some.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: What was that?
scene_heading: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREETS - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. TROITSKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

text: The Older Cop leans in the window.
speaker_heading: OLDER COP

dialog: Is this her?
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: (Russian)
dialog: Yes sir Sergeant Ravik.
text: The plainclothesman emerges from behind the Older Cop.
text: In one shocking, effortless motion, he places a silenced handgun to the Young
text: Cop's head and squeezes the trigger. Blood spatters the windshield.
text: JILLIAN gasps in horror at the plainclothesman. It is...ILYA.
text: The Older Cop opens the door, shoving the Young Cop's corpse to the
text: passenger side. Ilya gets in back next to Jillian, pressing the HANDGUN into her ribs. The cruiser ROARS off into St. Petersburg traffic.
scene_heading: EXT. AT THE FOOT OF TROITSKY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
text: TEMPLAR looks around. He sees A MOTORCYCLE STAND filled with MOTORCYCLES. Runs to it. Chooses a big, powerful, Honda street machine.
text: He pulls out his burglar's tools; jams one in the ignition. He has it running in seconds. He throws it in gear and ROARS off.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREETS - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: Templar blasts through traffic on the Honda. He's on a street parallel to Jillian's.
text: AT AN INTERSECTION Templar looks to his right, where he can see, one block over on the parallel street --
text: THE POLICE CRUISER moving through traffic. Templar guns the motorcycle. The engine WHINES. He races ahead,
text: accelerating through the gears. AT THE NEXT INTERSECTION - TEMPLAR throws the cycle into a skidding, hair-raising turn. He's going 'round the block to cut off the sedan.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG INTERSECTION - DAY
text: The police cruiser moves through the intersection. Suddenly TEMPLAR'S MOTORCYCLE, Templar-less, veers into the path of the cruiser. The cruiser hits it head on. The motorcycle rides up the cruiser's hood and smashes through the front windshield. The cruiser careens out of control. It fishtails twice and crashes into A STREETLIGHT POLE.
scene_heading: INT. THE POLICE CRUISER - DAY
text: UP FRONT, the Older Cop is unconscious; he's taken the full brunt of the motorcycle through the windshield.
text: IN THE BACK, Ilya is groggy, semi-conscious. JILLIAN is reeling also; there's a gash on her forehead. The BACK PASSENGER DOOR jerks open. TEMPLAR lunges inside. Ilya raises his gun but he's weak, disoriented. Templar yanks it from his hand and pistol whips him. This has all happened so fast. Jillian looks at Ilya then at Templar...
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: What...? WHO...?
dialog: And Templar yanks Jillian out.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS - DAY
text: The intersection is chaos: PEDESTRIANS running up, surrounding the police cruiser, vehicles stopping, etc.

scene_heading: INT. RUSSIAN ARMY SUPPLY TRUCK - DAY
text: The driver's side door opens. In comes Jillian, then Templar. Templar shoves Jillian across the front seat and gets in, behind the wheel. He floors it.
text: They accelerate into traffic. Templar looks at Jillian. She's trembling, staring
dialog: catatonically straight ahead.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Who are you. Tell me who you
dialog: are and what the hell is going on.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: I was hired to steal your research,
dialog: but you know that by now. You left the critical
dialog: data off the disk.
dialog: Where is it? memorized, right?
dialog: (she doesn't answer)
dialog: That's a bad cut. Here.
text: He hands her his HANDKERCHIEF. She swats it away.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Look, you're in big trouble.
dialog: The guy who hired me will do anything
dialog: to get your research. Once he has it, you're a
dialog: corpse. Give me the missing data and I'll get
dialog: you out of here. You can trust me.
text: She stares at him in disbelief.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Trust you?
dialog: (chews the word)
dialog: Trust you...?
text: She grabs the door handle and yanks it open. Templar grabs her arm, pulling her back. They wrestle back and forth...
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Damn it, don't be stupid...!
text: She picks up the CORPORAL'S STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE, sitting in a holder
text: on the console between them, and throws it in Templar's face.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
speaker_heading: ARGGH!
text: Templar recoils, blinded, releasing Jillian. He jerks the steering wheel to the side and stomps on the brakes. JILLIAN lunges out before the supply truck fully stops. She hits the pavement running. She hurries off, blending into the crowded sidewalk.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - STREETS
text: Templar gets out, cursing, wiping the hot liquid from his eyes. He looks around. Runs off in Jillian's direction, abandoning the supply truck.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - LOMONOSOVA AVENUE
text: Templar, running, out of breath, rounds a corner onto Lomonosova Avenue, in the city's shopping district. It's jammed with PEDESTRIANS, SHOPPERS, MERCHANTS, etc. Templar moves through the crowd, eyes scanning left and right. There's no sign of Jillian.
dialog: Then he sees her.
text: Just a glimpse. 50 yards ahead. Moving through the crowded sidewalk toward the FONTANKA (the largest and most beautiful of the city's grand canals).
scene_heading: EXT. LOMONOSOVA AVENUE - FONTANKA CANAL BRIDGE - SUNSET
text: Templar runs over the Fontanka Canal Bridge. Nothing. He comes back the
dialog: other way. Nothing.
text: He stops in the middle of the bridge, exhausted, out of breath. Below him,
text: passing under the bridge, all types of WATER CONVEYANCES (skiffs, barges,
dialog: dinghies, etc) are navigating the canal.
text: And emerging from underneath the bridge, seated in the back of a WATER
dialog: TAXI,...is Jillian. Templar races off the bridge.
scene_heading: EXT. FONTANKA CANAL - EMBANKMENT PROMENADE - SUNSET
text: Templar sprints down the sidewalk promenade next to the canal. The water
text: taxi is 50 yards past the bridge.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN sees him coming.
text: TEMPLAR closes the gap. 30 yards. 20 yards. Now 10. Now he's running
text: alongside the taxi, staring at Jillian.
text: And she stares back at him, stony, expressionless.
text: The canal is wider now, and the water taxi accelerates, pulling away from the
dialog: slower skiffs.
text: Templar slows to a jog. He stops, lungs heaving. The sun is setting to the
dialog: west.
text: The water taxi speeds off into the setting sun, leaving Templar with this
text: image of Jillian: eyes unblinking, staring at him with pure, unadulterated
dialog: hatred.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: GRACHA
dialog: We feud because we hate each other.
speaker_heading: TRETIAK

speaker_heading: GRACHA

scene_heading: INT. TRAIN TO MOSCOW - NIGHT

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Remy. Be at Moscow Airport
dialog: at eight a.m., fueled and ready to go.
text: Templar clicks off the phone and pockets it. Then he pockets the gun, its

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: We're going to sit here and not

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: How about: love thy neighbor.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: The man who said that was

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Were you raised by wolves?
dialog: Who were your parents, Lucretia

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Friends? I thought you trusted

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: I don't. Give it to me.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: The knife you just took.
text: Jillian sighs. Pulls the serving knife out of her sleeve and hands it over. When

text: THE GERMAN BUSINESSMAN has woken up. He's yawning, opening up a
text: stack of business correspondence sitting on the armrest of his chair with a
speaker_heading: LETTER OPENER.
text: JILLIAN continues down the aisle, sweating it out. If the guy discovers that

dialog: Each step is a mile.
dialog: Finally Jillian and Templar come to their berth. The German Businessman is
text: reading a letter. The letter opener is sitting on the stack of unopened letters.
dialog: Jillian "accidentally" knocks the stack of letters and letter opener off the

dialog: They're drawing closer to the waiting Mercedes...
speaker_heading: JILLIAN

speaker_heading: WHITEHEAD
dialog: Hah hah, I bet you did. I'm a baseball

dialog: The Buffalo Bills lost four Super Bowls, Whitehead.

text: JILLIAN sprints across the circular drive for Templar's car, Whitehead after
text: her. The men by the waiting Mercedes converge on Jillian from the side.
text: TEMPLAR throws open the passenger side door for Jillian.
text: The men coming from the Mercedes open fire on Templar, blowing in the

speaker_heading: JILLIAN'S almost there...

text: She tries to shut the door; WHITEHEAD gets hold of it.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN SCREAMS at Templar.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Go!
text: Templar floors it. The car SQUEALS away from the curb. Whitehead runs

text: The car accelerates. Whitehead sprints but can't keep up. His feet leave the

text: Whitehead pulls his gun from his shoulder holster and aims across Jillian's
dialog: body at Templar. His finger
text: squeezes the trigger as Jillian shoves his hand up.
text: BULLETS blow holes in the roof of the car.
text: JILLIAN hits Whitehead, hard, in the head.

speaker_heading: JILLIAN

text: Jillian cringes, expecting the worst. Templar throws the steering wheel and --
scene_heading: EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION - DAY
text: -- The sedan swerves, clearing the BLIND MAN by two inches, skidding wildly
dialog: through the intersection.
scene_heading: INT. TEMPLAR'S STOLEN SEDAN - DAY
text: Templar fights the wheel but he's losing...
dialog: The skid can't be corrected. Jillian SCREAMS.
scene_heading: EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION - DAY
text: The sedan slides sideways, hits the curb and flips over, spinning like a top
dialog: across the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHITEHEAD'S MERCEDES - DAY
text: The Mercedes moves through traffic. Whitehead and the other men look

text: Across the intersection is the OVERTURNED SEDAN on the sidewalk,
speaker_heading: surrounded by gawking PEDESTRIANS.
scene_heading: EXT. MOSCOW - INTERSECTION
text: The Mercedes pulls up. Whitehead and his men get out. They warily approach

text: Whitehead and his men surround the car. They kneel, guns trained
dialog: inside...Templar and Jillian are gone.
dialog: Whitehead barks at his men.
speaker_heading: WHITEHEAD
dialog: Fifteen block radius.
dialog: Go house to house.
text: Whitehead looks around at the surrounding buildings. We FOCUS on one of

text: and mesh wire, in the process of renovation. CAMERA pushes in on the
dialog: church's HUGE ONION SHAPED TURRET. . . . .
scene_heading: INT. MOSCOW - RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH
text: and we're in the turret's interior: round, with stained glass windows, a desk
text: and chair. A trap door leading to the vestibule below BANGS OPEN.
text: JILLIAN comes up, followed by Templar, his gun in hand.
dialog: They're cut and bruised, exhausted.
text: Jillian slumps against the wall, shivering.
text: Templar puts his equipment on the desk and goes to each of the windows.
dialog: From this elevation he can see the entire city.
text: TEMPLAR'S FIRST POV - RED SQUARE, a mile across town, where a thousand
dialog: Muscovites are listening to a pro Michael Romanov speech.
dialog: Shifting from Red Square to the city outskirts, we see MOSCOW
text: INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, where Remy waits.
text: TEMPLAR'S SECOND POV - THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY is just a few blocks
text: away - we see the American flag flying from the roof stanchion.
text: In the intersections around the embassy, Tretiak's men stand by their
text: vehicles, watching. Every point of access to the embassy is sealed.
text: We see WHITEHEAD. A Mercedes pulls up to him. ILYA gets out.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: The embassy's surrounded.
speaker_heading: BACK TO SCENE - JILLIAN
text: is staring at Templar's computer. The modem is engaging. JILLIAN sits up,
dialog: staring at the screen.
dialog: Jillian reads an ELECTRONIC MESSAGE which appears:
speaker_heading: BEAR CONTACTING LION.
speaker_heading: GIVE HER TO ME.
scene_heading: IN RETURN, 20 MILLION AND SAFE PASSAGE.
dialog: IF YOU REFUSE YOU WILL DIE.
text: Jillian's eyes grow wide with terror.
text: Templar looks out a third window.
dialog: TEMPLAR'S THIRD POV - Tretiak's men are going building to building in a
dialog: fifteen block radius sweep, closing in on the church.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: The airport's out. They're drawing a
dialog: noose around us. We don't have much time.
text: TEMPLAR turns away from the window. He sees Jillian looking at his computer. He walks over to it and reads the message. Jillian gets slowly to her feet, watching Templar. JILLIAN's mouth quivers as Templar types: LION CONSIDERING OFFER. Templar looks at Jillian. She stares back. A long moment. Neither moves.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: What are you going to do? Tell me. I deserve at least that.
dialog: (desperate now)
dialog: I'll die. If you take their offer, they'll kill me.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: And if I don't, they'll kill me.
dialog: Interesting situation I'd say.
text: Jillian sinks to the chair, her voice shaking.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Oh god. It's over, it's all over... You're not human. You're an animal.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: I'm a businessman. I perform services for profit. And spare me the lecture. You didn't spend ten years in that mildewed basement for the good of humanity, you did it to get rich. Richer than anyone on earth. Richer than God.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll make you an offer - pay me my fifteen million out of your royalties - should come to about one month's. . .
text: Pause. She slowly looks up at him.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: You fool. Don't you understand?
dialog: (her voice cracks; she begins to softly cry)
dialog: It wasn't about money, it wasn't about becoming rich...
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: If you don't own the patent rights, who does?
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: A foundation in my name. The royalties
dialog: were going to go to scientific research,
dialog: curing cancer, .. .christ how can you understand this...
text: She lowers her head, weeping openly.
text: CAMERA PUSHES in on Templar, staring at her. Even the darkest of men have a seed of goodness. Here, for the first time, does it flower in Simon Templar.
dialog: But we don't know this. Templar betrays nothing.
text: He picks up his homing device and clicks it on.
dialog: He types in this command: MOSCOW.
text: The device beeps; THE MOSCOW STREET GRID appears.
speaker_heading: He types a new command: SUBTERRANEAN DATA.
text: Moscow's SUBTERRANEAN GRID appears superimposed over the street grid;
text: we see the guts of the city; the Moscow subway, water and gas mains, etc. In a corner of the screen is a TABLE OF SCHEDULES.
dialog: Templar analyzes the information on the screen.
text: He quickly rises; goes to Jillian, pulling off his belt.
text: He pulls her up. She stands limply, still weeping, no longer resisting. He's
dialog: bigger and stronger, there's no use. Templar gathers Jillian's wrists together
dialog: and ties them with the belt.
dialog: He pulls her to the trapdoor and CUT TO:
speaker_heading: EXT. MOSCOW - SIDEWALK
text: Several pedestrians walk by. Templar walks Jillian quickly to a MANHOLE
text: COVER. He kneels and hoists the cover off. He points into the hole.
text: Jillian, her wrists bound, steps down uneasily, her feet finding the top rung of
text: a STEEL LADDER. She descends into the manhole. Templar follows.
scene_heading: INT. MOSCOW - SUBTERRANEAN SEWER SYSTEM - DAY
text: Jillian and Templar come down the ladder, dropping to the steel-gridded
dialog: walkway over the Moscow sewer.
text: Templar pulls Jillian twenty feet down the walkway.
text: At this point in the wall there is a HATCH with a compression HATCHWHEEL,
text: the turning of which opens the hatch, like on a submarine.
text: Within the hatch we hear RUSHING WATER.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: That's a municipal water main.
dialog: In one hour you're going in there.
text: Templar pulls out a SWITCHBLADE. Clicks it on.
text: Jillian, shivering with terror, stares at the blade...
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Listen. They shut it down twice a
dialog: day for five minutes to clean the filters.
text: Once at noon, once at midnight. Noon is in one hour.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: How do you know all this?
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Part of my job. Now ask the logical question...
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: .. . where does it go?
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Very good. Under the United States Embassy.
dialog: There's an exit hatch into the embassy
dialog: courtyard. That's where we're going.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: We...?
text: Templar lowers his gun. He lowers the blade to her wrists and cuts the belt.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: You heard me.
text: A long pause. They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Then what happens?
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Let's get to the embassy,
dialog: then we'll talk about it.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Templar - about that night at my house
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Don't talk about it, okay?

speaker_heading: MOSCOW POLICE SERGEANT
dialog: Disperse. Disperse!
dialog: On come the Romanov supporters. Rocks start flying. The Romanov
text: supporters push into the line of police. The police push back with shields and truncheons. A melee breaks out. The Romanov supporters surge past the police. It is a wild, uncontrolled, chaotic scene.
scene_heading: EXT. MOSCOW - THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - DAY
text: ROMANOV SUPPORTERS flood past the embassy gates, chased by Moscow
text: Policemen. Fights rage allover the street. A full-fledged riot is breaking out. OVERTURNED CARS are burning. LOOTERS run through the streets with stolen goods. We hear the sporadic CRACKLE of small arms fire.

text: INSERT - TEMPLAR'S WRISTWATCH - it is exactly 12 noon.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Right on time.
text: The water subsides to a trickle. Templar grips the hatchwheel and turns it. Opens the hatch. Residual water spills out onto the walkway. Templar pulls himself into the water main. He extends his hand to Jillian. Jillian looks uncertainly inside.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Four blocks. Right under Tretiak's men
dialog: and up into the embassy compound. You can do this.
text: She grabs Templar's hand. He pulls her up and inside --
scene_heading: INT. MOSCOW - MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - DAY
text: -- a four foot diamater pipe. Templar pulls out a PENLIGHT, switches it on and
text: sticks it between his teeth. On hands and kneess Templar and Jillian move off
dialog: through the water main.
scene_heading: INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - EXIT HATCH UNDER STREET
text: Templar and Jillian crawl up. Templar shines his penlight at the ceiling; AN

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: It doesn't seem like we've gone far enough.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: We haven't, up there's the street in

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: There it is.

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Oh my god...
text: The EXIT HATCH has no hatchwheel. It's sealed.

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: We. ...we've got to go back.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR

dialog: Not enough time.

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: What about Tretiak's men
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Better than drowning.
text: They scramble off. We hear WHOOSHING WATER coming down the pipe.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: The water's back on!
dialog: Back they go, crawling as fast as they can.
scene_heading: INT. MUNICIPAL WATER MAIN - EXIT HATCH UNDER STREET
text: Templar and Jillian reach the exit hatch under the street. Templar grips the
dialog: hatchwheel as --
text: THE WATER ROARS through the pipe, hitting Jillian flush, blowing her
text: backward; she desperately clings to Templar's shoulders as he spins the
text: hatchwheel. The water rises mercilessly. There's a foot of air, then six inches, then just three, then none at all, and they're under water... TEMPLAR desperately turns the hatchwheel, spinning it one last time and WHOOOSH, the hatch door blows open 
scene_heading: INT. MOSCOW - MANHOLE BELOW THE STREET
text: - - and SMASHES against A ONE FOOT DIAMETER PIPE running along the wall
text: of the service manhole, CRACKING a fissure in it. PRESSURIZED GAS blows
text: out of the pipe. TEMPLAR pulls himself up. He reaches down and pulls Jillian up. Templar kicks the exit hatchdoor closed and spins the hatchwheel shut.
text: JILLIAN looks at the GAS spewing from the cracked pipe.
text: She sniffs the air. Templar looks at the pipe. A warning is printed in five
speaker_heading: languages: GAS - DANGEROUS.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: City gas line.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: We can't stay here,
dialog: we'll asphyxiate.
text: Templar and Jillian clamber up the steel runged ladder to the manhole cover.
text: Templar pushes up the manhole cover, popping his head out, looking around. HIS EYES widen with alarm ---
text: A POLICE VAN is rolling straight for his head. He ducks and closes the
text: manhole cover as the VAN RUMBLES over it.
text: Templar listens. Above, the van has stopped.
text: Templar pushes up the manhole cover. The VAN has stopped directly over the
dialog: manhole.
scene_heading: EXT. MOSCOW - STREET IN FRONT OF THE U. S. EMBASSY
text: Templar slithers out. Pulls up Jillian. They're under the van now.
text: The van's rear door opens; TEN MEN jump down to the pavement. We see
text: their BLACK BOOTS; they are MOSCOW POLICE, arriving to arrest the looters.
text: Templar and Jillian crawl toward the van's rear.
text: Templar looks toward THE U.S. EMBASSY. It's 100 yards away, but looks like
dialog: 100 miles.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Both of us will never make it.
dialog: But one of us can.
dialog: (draws his gun)
dialog: Give me ten seconds, then
dialog: break for the embassy and
dialog: don't stop running until you're
dialog: at the gates. It's a hundred yards,

speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: What are you going to...
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: That's my business.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Wait...

text: A long, tense pause.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: The world can do without Simon
dialog: Templar. It can't do without you.
dialog: (smiles grimly)
dialog: See you around sometime.
text: He takes a deep breath and logrolls out. ABOVE THE VAN - TEMPLAR gets to his feet in the street, gun drawn. He
text: races from the van, heading in a direction away from the embassy.
text: ACROSS THE STREET - ILYA double takes, seeing Templar sprinting from the
dialog: van.
speaker_heading: ILYA
dialog: Kill him!
text: Ilya, Whitehead and Tretiak's men sprint down the street after Templar, firing

speaker_heading: COLONEL CROSBY
dialog: What the hell is going on.

speaker_heading: UNDER THE VAN - JILLIAN

dialog: his breath.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR
dialog: Go. Faster.. . .
text: ILYA, firing on Templar, sees Jillian. He spins, running in a new direction. He's
text: going to get Jillian before she can reach the embassy. JILLIAN, sprinting, screams to the embassy marines.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Open the gate!
text: IN THE EMBASSY COURTYARD - COLONEL CROSBY turns to his second in command, a Lieutenant JONES.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CROSBY
dialog: Do it.
text: Lieutenant Jones and a MARINE PRIVATE push open the embassy gates.
text: COLONEL CROSBY watches Jillian helplessly. There's nothing he can do. Not until she reaches the embassy. On Jillian comes, legs pumping, feet pounding the pavement. ILYA is right behind her. She can feel his breath he's so close. Twenty yards. Fifteen yards. Ten...
text: BEHIND THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR dodges bullets, corning thick and heavy now, and watches in terror as ---
text: ILYA, with a desperate reach, collars Jillian. She shrugs off her jacket, leaving Ilya with the jacket but no Jillian. Jillian lunges through the embassy gates...
text: ... and is instantly surrounded by U.S. Marines. Jillian looks up at Colonel Crosby, panting.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: I'm an American citizen.
speaker_heading: COLONEL CROSBY
dialog: You have our full protection ma'am.
dialog: (looks at Ilya)
dialog: Back away from the gate.
text: Ilya's black eyes stare at Colonel Crosby. He backs away from the gate. He turns and sees 
text: AT THE OVERTURNED CAR - TEMPLAR, out of bullets with his hands raised,
text: surrounded by Tretiak's men behind the overturned automobile. Ilya, fuming, walks across the street to Templar. AT THE OVERTURNED CAR - ILYA walks up to Templar. With the calm efficiency of a hangman, Ilya puts his hand on Templar's shoulder and forces him down, down to his knees. He sticks his gun to Templar's head.
text: He's going to execute Templar right there, behind the overturned car in the street.
text: IN THE EMBASSY COURTYARD - JILLIAN, watching, frantically turns to Colonel Crosby.
speaker_heading: JILLIAN
dialog: Do something!
speaker_heading: COLONEL CROSBY
dialog: That's Russian soil out there, ma'am.

speaker_heading: TEMPLAR (Russian)
dialog: Wait. A cigarette. It's customary.
text: Ilya looks at Templar. Looks at his men.

text: All of TRETIAK'S MEN laugh in Templar's face.
text: Ilya takes out a cigarette. Hands it to Templar.
dialog: Lights it for him.
speaker_heading: TEMPLAR (Russian)
dialog: Thank-you.
dialog: And Ilya and Tretiak's men continue to laugh.
dialog: They won't be for long...
dialog: Because Templar is looking at A GRATE above the municipal lines below. And
text: TRETIAK'S MEN are sniffing the air, wondering why it smells like rotten
dialog: eggs...
text: Templar flicks the cigarette into the grate and dives away as --
text: THE ENTIRE STREET IN FRONT OF THE U. S. EMBASSY blows sky high as THE
speaker_heading: GAS MAIN ignites .
text: Ilya, Whitehead, and the other men are blown off their feet. Some are killed.
dialog: Asphalt and dirt rain down, followed by --

text: The police van SCREECHS up next to the Lear. Templar races from the van to
dialog: the jet, dodging BULLETS fired from --
text: TRETIAK'S MEN, firing from sedans entering the square.
text: The Lear jet accelerates straight for the oncoming sedans, lifting off, almost

scene_heading: INT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Ilya emerges from the basement stairwell and races for the front door.
text: Templar comes up; sprints after Ilya.
text: Ilya, with Templar hotly behind, gets to the front door, flings it open, and...
text: freezes. And Ilya and Templar are suddenly staring down the barrel of --
text: A RUSSIAN TANK. Just sitting there in the mansion courtyard. Russian
dialog: soldiers behind it.
text: Ilya and Templar duck. The tank FIRES. The MISSILE PROJECTILE explodes

dialog: Templar's heads...
dialog: ... wings across the interior of the mansion...
text: .. . and SLAMS into the rear wall of the mansion, exploding, blowing the wall
text: down, revealing ANOTHER TANK at the mansion's rear, lumbering toward it.

dialog: gash, dazing him.
dialog: There's no place to go. Except up.

dialog: tri-pod...
speaker_heading: ON THE STAIRCASE - TEMPLAR AND ILYA

text: Templar repeats Ilya's actions: climbs atop the balustrade and jumps to the
text: lip of the crater. As he pulls himself up... ILYA appears.
text: He compresses his foot against Templar's knuckles.
dialog: Templar grimaces. There's no way out this time.

scene_heading: EXT. TRETIAK' S HEADQUARTERS / NEVSKY PROSPECT - NIGHT

dialog: No one's surrendering. It's a fight to the death...
scene_heading: EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ROOF - NIGHT
text: Templar and Ilya, on the mansion's roof. The view is mind-boggling: the
text: nighttime St. Petersburg skyline looming in the background and, below, three
dialog: Russian tanks firing shell after shell into the mansion.
text: Across the exploding, crumbling rooftop, Ilya and Templar go. A TANK SHELL
dialog: explodes in front of Ilya.
text: Ilya falls, concussed by the shell. Templar dives upon him, wrenching the
dialog: COMPUTER DISK from Ilya's pocket.
text: Ilya slams his forearm into Templar's head. The disk flies from Templar's
text: hand, scuttles across the roof shingles, falling through a crater...
text: ... it flutters to the mansion floor, 50 feet down.
dialog: They get to their feet, circling each other. Their footing is not trustworthy, like
dialog: ice in Spring.
dialog: Tank shells SLAM into the mansion's upper architecture and roof. A shell hits
text: the mansion's east wall, detaching the DRAIN PIPE running up it.
text: Ilya draws a SWITCHBLADE. Backing Templar up.
text: Templar's at the very edge of the building.
dialog: There's no place to go.
text: Templar's feet are unsteady. Because the cornice of the building is crumbling
dialog: beneath him. ...
text: And Templar falls. He looks over his shoulder, his wrists turning, hands
dialog: opening, and...
dialog: ... Templar catches the detached DRAINPIPE.
text: The drainpipe sags under Templar's weight, bending... And it stops. Templar
text: hangs there, bobbing up and down above the alley between the mansion and
text: the adjacent building, fifty feet below.
dialog: Ilya turns back.
dialog: He's going after the disk.
text: Ilya jumps through the crater to the mezzanine and races down the
dialog: staircase...while in the basement...
scene_heading: INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT
text: Another whole shelf of chemicals falls, smashing. The chemicals continue to
dialog: mix...
scene_heading: EXT. TRETIAK'S HEADQUARTERS - ROOF

dialog: looks down into the flames and demolition below...
scene_heading: INT. TRETIAK's MANSION - STAIRCASE/FOYER - NIGHT
text: Ilya races reaches the foyer. The building is imploding, chunks of stone falling
dialog: all around him.
dialog: Ilya's eyes are wild. He wants that disk...
dialog: Ilya gets to it.
text: Clutches it. It's finally in his hands.
dialog: He goes for the staircase. ...
scene_heading: INT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - ZUBOV'S LAB - NIGHT
text: The chemicals are steaming now, in a froth, becoming more and more and
dialog: more volatile...
scene_heading: EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: Templar, dangling from the drainpipe, looks wildly around for an escape. If he
dialog: could just get to that adjacent building...
dialog: It's too far. And his hands are slipping...
dialog: Then, from the mansion's basement, the very guts of the building, the
dialog: chemicals in the lab detonate and --
speaker_heading: THE MANSION EXPLODES FROM WITHIN.
scene_heading: INT. TRETIAK' S MANS ION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
text: Ilya's eyes bulge in terror as the staircase collapses under him. Ilya falls,
text: engulfed in flame, still clutching the cold fusion disk.
scene_heading: EXT. TRETIAK'S MANSION - NIGHT
text: The drainpipe fully detaches from the collapsing mansion wall. It falls away
dialog: from the mansion, with Templar still holding on...
text: Templar releases from the drainpipe and catches the lip of the roof cornice of
dialog: the adjacent building.
text: Templar pulls himself up and looks back at...
text: TRETIAK'S MANSION. The entire building comes apart at the seams. It
