speaker_heading: CAMERON (cont'd) (o.s.)
dialog: no wanting to be fisited. And yet
dialog: this house...this house and the
dialog: Island are for all time linked
dialog: most tragically together...
text: The voice fades as a jeep, vintage World War II, comes
text: down the road, slowing down and finally stopping in front
text: of the house. The CAMERA closes in and by the time the
text: back door opens and a man, an American officer in battle
text: dress, gets out of the car, we are in MEDIUM CLOSE-UP.
text: The man turns and faces the house as if confronting it.
text: His eyes narrow speculatively as he slowly, Geliberately,
text: takes in the dark decay of the place, the ‘FOR SALE' sign,
text: itself now old and forlornly awry on its base.
text: At last the man moves across the weedy stretch of lawn,
text: mounts the steps, starts to knock, changes his mind and
text: tries the door. It opens easily, and he steps into the
text: house, closing the door gently behind him.
text: He finds himself in a small entrance hall. On either side
text: of him are closed-off rooms. Before him is a staircase
text: curving gracefully upward. A pale light dimly penetrates
text: the dirty fanlight above the door, making it possible for
text: the man...and for us...to make out the gracious lines of
dialog: the architecture. Even now, in this sorry stete, one can
dialog: imagine how inviting, how warm, this small manor house
dialog: must once have been.
text: Without haste, the man takes in the sight, the ambiance.
text: But, though unhurried, he wastes no time, for his interest,
text: his focus of attention, seems to be on the staircase and
text: on the unseen floor above.
text: Slowly, he begins to mount the stairs. At the top, he
text: discovers a door, open upon a dark and deeply silent room.
text: Quietly, he enters. All of this room's past, which can be
text: taken away, has gone. Such light as there is...no more
text: than enough to make shadows...comes from the only window,
text: which is at the back and incompletely shrouded in sacking.
text: Also toward the back of the room is another door.- It is
text: closed. As his eyes adjust to the dark, they circle the
text: room, taking in the peeling wallpaper, the desolated,
text: deserted sadness of it all, until finally his eyes came to
dialog: rest upon the only furnishings in the room... if two up-
dialog: ended packing cases and a chair may be called furnishings.

text: On top of one of the cases is an unlighted candle ina
text: holder, and beside it is a chair, the back of which is
text: turned toward the man. These objects seem only to add
text: to the impression of empty desertion. And then, in the
text: dark, the man becomes slowly conscious of the faintest,
text: “almost indiscernible movement. It is in the chair. He
text: freezes. There is a moment of utterly suspended animation.
text: Then he speaks, his voice hardly a whisper.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Who's there?
text: THE CAMERA closes in tight on the chair, as from its
text: depth the movement takes shape and turns to face the man.
text: In the chair is a woman, old, gaunt, narrow-eyed...as
text: frightened by the man as he has been by her. Only when
text: her old gimlet eyes observe the obviously corporeal
text: Rature of the intruder, does she let out her breath.
text: Hostilely, she regards him.

text: When the haze lifts we are looking at the room as it was
dialog: some forty-five years ago on the serene afternoon that

dialog: them. It is furnished, as we have already heard, with the
text: blue curtains, the sofa on which KENNETH had his first
text: swimming lessons, the Peacocks on the wil, and the apple
text: tree is in full blossom at the Open window. One of the
text: tree's branches has even stepped into the room.
text: MR. MORLAND and the local clergyman, MR. AMY, are chatting
text: importantly about sane matter of no importance, while MRS.
text: MORLAND is on her sofa at the other side of the room. She
text: is knitting and she comes into the conversation occasionally
text: with a cough or a click of her needles. This is her
dialog: tactful way of telling her husband not to be so assertive to
text: his guest. All three people are slightly over forty years
dialog: of age. They are People who have found life to be, on the
text: whole, an easy and hapoy adventure. The squire is only a
dialog: @mall squire of very moderate means who passes life Pleasant-
dialog: ly and not unprofitably in being a J.P. and will discuss for
dialog: days or months the advisability of putting @pew roof on a
text: tenant's cowshed. Eventually, without his knowing it, his
text: wife will make up his mind for him. Even she does not know
text: she has done it. MRS. MORLAND is a delightful woman with
text: rather shrewder sense than her husband, and she has a joke
dialog: that has kept her merry through all her married life, viz.
text: her husband. She adores him, however, and they are an
text: extremely happy sociable couple. MR. AMY is even more
text: sociable than MR, MORLAND; he is reputed to know everyone
text: in the county, and has several times fallen off his horse
text: because he will salute all passers-by. On his visits to
dialog: London he usually returns depressed use there are so
dialog: many people in the streets to whom he may not give a° friendly
dialog: bow. He likes to read a book if he knows the residence of
dialog: &@ relative of the author, and at a Play it is far more to
text: him to learn that the actress has three children, one of
text: them down with measles, than to follow her histrionic genius.
dialog: He and his host have the pleasant habit of print-collecting,
text: and a very common scene between them is that which now
