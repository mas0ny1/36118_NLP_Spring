speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: A distant whistle, then softly, CH...CH...CH... A train
text: approaching... Over the black screen, in white letters:
dialog: Life is like a train.
text: Life, like a train, travels up hills and down valleys,
text: Life, like a train, sometimes gets off track,
text: The train, like life, keeps its own schedule,
text: The train, like life, has a final destination.
dialog: Life is like a train,
text: Only the train departs and returns,
dialog: But life, oh life, it never comes back.
dialog: Unknown
text: The train sounds fade as--—
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL CROSSING, SIMI VALLEY - DAY
text: A decrepit brown Lincoln drives over ballast - track gravel -
text: that has spilled from the track to the asphalt road below.
text: The car stops right in front of the crossing signal. It’s
text: green. Run-down apartment buildings create a depressing
text: backdrop behind the car. The air is so hot, it ripples.
scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN - DAY
text: LAURA DANNER, 27, neglected, oily hair, doughy skin, shuts
text: the engine. Next to her, DAVEY DANNER, 9, cradles a
text: scratched, black toy locomotive in his lap. Laura, drowsy,
text: leans her head against the seat. Her speech is slurred.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What day is it?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Tuesday. I told you.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: And the date.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: August eighth.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: We'll wait, Davey. We’ll wait here
dialog: until it comes and then...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Did you know the Coast Starlight
dialog: goes all the way to Seattle?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (praying; eyes closed)
dialog: O God, you are my God, I wait for
dialog: You from the dawn...
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: There’s two engineers on every
text: passenger train. They change teams
dialog: every twelve. hours.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: ..-My soul thirsts for You, my body
dialog: longs for You... Pray with me,
dialog: Davey.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I already prayed.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: .--My lips will praise You for Your
dialog: mercy is better than life itself.
text: The crossing light goes from green to a flashing red.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s here!
text: She starts the car.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Wait, Mom. Don’t go! It’s coming.
text: She presses on the gas and hurls the Lincoln forward, past
text: the signal, up the embankment, onto some gravel and then the
text: tracks. They bounce as the car’s tires jump the rail, then
text: the ties and then the rail again. She stops the car.
scene_heading: EXT. RAIL CROSSING - DAY
text: The Lincoln sits with its front wheels over the far side of
text: the tracks. Its rear tires slightly touch the near rail.
scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN - DAY
text: Laura locks the doors, takes the keys out of the ignition.
text: Wide-eyed, Davey watches as she hurls the keys out the
text: window. She turns to him.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Time to rest now.
scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION - COAST STARLIGHT - DAY
text: Blue letters on silver cars: COAST STARLIGHT. The shiny,
text: Majestic train is almost ready to depart.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - HALLWAY - DAY
text: TOM STARK, 44, and N.B. GARCIA, a massive man, graying hair,
text: hurry down a marble corridor - rough men who talk tough, walk
text: gruffly and live hard.
dialog: N.B.
dialog: How you holding up, Tom? Doing
dialog: alright?
text: The long corridor is adorned with black and white pictures
text: depicting trains and passengers in the 30's and 40’s.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: My train’s running in ten minutes.
dialog: N.B.
dialog: No telling with that messed-up
dialog: disease. My mother-in-law, God
dialog: rest her soul, was only 63--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Megan's 38.
dialog: N.B.
dialog: Take time off. I got you covered.
text: VINCE, 50’s, another engineer, barrels toward them holding a
text: stack of papers: train orders.
dialog: N.B.
dialog: (to Vince)
text: About time, Hoghead.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Car trouble. Sorry, Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What do I care?
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: I got your train today. It’s all
text: set with the boys upstairs.
text: Tom studies him hard, then turns to N.B.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No. I want to work.
text: He pushes a door open, exiting to--
scene_heading: EXT. COAST STARLIGHT - PLATFORM - DAY
text: PASSENGERS board the train, passing a sign that reads:
scene_heading: UNION STATION - LOS ANGELES
text: An ELDERLY COUPLE waves goodbye to their SON and
text: GRANDCHILDREN. A STEWARD, in an Amtrak uniform, points a
text: WOMAN to her car. Tom heads to the locomotive with N.B.
text: Vince follows close behind.
dialog: N.B.
dialog: Can I say this as your friend and
dialog: not your boss? You're not dealing
dialog: with it.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I’m dealing with it my way.
dialog: N.B.
dialog: Listen. I'’1l give you all the
dialog: streaks you can handle, but you
dialog: keep running away from her, you’1l
dialog: regret it forever.
text: Tom climbs into the locomotive. N.B. shakes his head and
text: turns to Vince.
dialog: N.B.
dialog: Give him the orders.
text: Vince hands Tom the paperwork.
scene_heading: EXT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY
text: A two-story suburban home. MEGAN STARK, 38, pale, short
text: blonde hair, exceedingly thin, pounds the hard soil with a
text: trowel. A palette of mixed-color impatiens sits nearby. She
text: chooses the pink ones, entombs them in the dirt.
text: A car pulls in the driveway. Megan smiles and rises. A
text: sharp pain cuts through her lower back. She GASPS, falling
text: to her knees on the dirt.
text: SUSAN GARCIA, plump, in a nurse’s scrubs, exits the car
text: holding a large copper pot. Seeing that Megan is down, she
text: puts the pot on the driveway and rushes toward her.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What do you think you’re doing?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
text: Planting flowers.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: To work in your condition...Really,
dialog: it’s insane.
text: She helps her up. They walk toward the house.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Where's Tom? I thought he was
dialog: keeping an eye on you.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Sometimes I feel like he can’t
dialog: stand to be around me.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (uncomfortable with
dialog: intimate subject)
dialog: My soup!
text: She hurries down the black asphalt driveway to retrieve the
text: copper pot. Megan, pensive, watches as Susan bends down to--
scene_heading: EXT. DINER, SAN FRANCISCO - DUSK
text: A_black asphalt road. It cuts a dizzyingly precipitous
text: incline. A 50’s style building sits at the top of the hill.
scene_heading: INT. DINER, SAN FRANCISCO - DUSK
text: YOUNG MEGAN, 22, adorable in a pink waitress outfit and a
text: ponytail, and LEE, also 20's, waitress, watch YOUNG TOM, 28,
text: from behind the counter: Shy and stiff, he sits at one booth,
text: reading a very heavy textbook. He looks up at Megan - meets
text: her eyes - and quickly returns to his book.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: What does he want?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Babe, he’s been coming here twice a
dialog: day, every day, for two weeks.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEE (cont'd)
dialog: Trust me. It’s not for the
dialog: pancakes.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: You think...? Oh.
text: She saunters to Tom’s table with a pen and pad. He looks at
text: her, smiles. She takes the book away from him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: May I?
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: (reading book title)
dialog: “The Railroad: What It Is, What It
dialog: Does.” Straight forward. I like
dialog: that in a man.
text: She gives the book back, looks at him expectantly. He can’t
dialog: think of anything to say, but:
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: Coffee please.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: Haven’t you had enough for one day?
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: You’re working a double.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: On Wednesdays.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: Right.
text: She smiles. Tongue-tied, he opens his book and furtively
text: watches her as she joins Lee behind the counter. She pours
text: his coffee. The girls giggle, whispering. Megan turns -
text: catches him staring again. She approaches with his cup,
text: places it on the table and waits. He doesn’t say anything,
text: just grins. She sighs.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: You keep staring, but you won’t
dialog: talk to me.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: I can’t help it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: The staring or the talking part?
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: Both.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: You're infuriating.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: I don’t know if I should slap you
dialog: or kiss you. Repeat after me. I...
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: I?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: Would like...
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: Would like--
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: To take you out sometime...
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: To take you...You’d go out with me?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: Now that you’ve asked so nicely,
dialog: why not?
text: He smiles widely. She laughs.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: It has the easy, comfortable feeling a room gets when its
dialog: occupants have lived with each other for a length of time,
text: and yet the sparse furnishings make it seem transitory.
text: Megan, holding a glass of water, lies on the bed. Susan,
text: sitting by her, sips a bowl of her own homemade soup.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (offering soup)
dialog: Sure you don’t want some?
text: Megan shakes her head, reaches for a pill bottle and takes
text: out a capsule. She swallows it with some water. An open
text: catalogue sits on the night stand, showing a baby grand
text: piano. Megan puts her glass down next to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Beautiful, isn’t it?
text: Susan glances at the catalogue.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: The piano?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I ordered it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're kidding.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I’‘m going to learn how to play.
dialog: I've always wanted to learn.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, Megan. Megan! You have to
dialog: rest. Take it easy.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: “Do not go gentle into that good
text: night...Rage, rage, rage against
dialog: the dying of the light.”
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Is that what you’re doing? Raging?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: It’s a Dylan Thomas poem. Did I
dialog: ever tell you I was an English
dialog: major?
text: The phone rings on the night stand. Megan ignores it. It
text: rings again, making Susan anxious.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Should I get it?
text: She puts the soup down and hurries to the phone.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Stark residence...No, it’s not, may
dialog: I say who’s calling...Oh...Is he
dialog: alright?...Yes...Yes...thank you.
text: Shaken, she puts down the phone. Megan, puzzled, studies her.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Tom had an accident.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - ENGINE CAR #1 - DAY
text: Dark. The noise emanating from the enormous, shiny 16-
text: cylinder, 4200 horsepower engine is deafening. A small door,
text: leading out of the car, opens. Daylight floods the engine. A
text: BRAKEMAN peers inside.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST STARLIGHT - ENGINE CAR #1 - DAY
text: The Brakeman walks along the engine cars - there are three of
dialog: them - for one final check up.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - ENGINE CAR #2 - DAY
text: Another massive 16-cylinder engine roars.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - ENGINE CAR #3 - DAY
text: The last gargantuan engine is ready. The Brakeman shuts the
text: engine car’s door.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - LOCOMOTIVE - DAY
text: The roar from the three engines comes in waves. The
text: locomotive is surprisingly small. Two GE desktop consoles
text: occupy most of the space in the car. Each console has an
text: elaborate instrument panel.
text: Tom studies the train orders, fills out paperwork. OTIS
text: PETALAS, manning the other side of the console, is a lean,
text: glass-wearing man in his 30's.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What the hell’s today?
speaker_heading: oTiIs
dialog: Tuesday. August eighth. Sure you
dialog: should be driving, Tom?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Don’t you start with me too.
text: He scribbles the date, then signs the orders. Otis raises his
text: hands in surrender and picks up a black phone - a radio.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: This is the Coast Starlight, and we
dialog: are setting up and running...Wanda,
dialog: your favorite train is leaving...
speaker_heading: WANDA (V.O.)
text: About time, Coast Starlight.
speaker_heading: oTiIs
dialog: Come on. Don’t give us a hard time
dialog: over five little minutes...
text: Tom smiles.
speaker_heading: oTrs
dialog: ++-You know you want me.
speaker_heading: WANDA (V.O.)
dialog: Like I want hemorrhoids. Over and
dialog: out, Romeo.
text: Otis puts down the radio. Tom laughs.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Romeo?!
speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: Oh, yeah. Love on a train - ain't
dialog: nothin’ like it.
text: Tom looks out into the already hot sun.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - FIRST CLASS COMPARTMENT - MOVING - DAWN
text: Pale sunrays paint the old-fashioned sleeper compartment
text: silver. Young Megan, reclines on the narrow bunk. Young Tom,
text: undoes her blouse. His fingers study her curves. She moans.
text: He hikes up her skirt, whispering in her ear...
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: Megan...
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: Yes, Tom.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: How do you feel about trains now?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MEGAN
dialog: I love them...
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: YOUNG TOM
dialog: I love you.
text: She pulls him toward her. They move together to the rhythm
dialog: of the train.
scene_heading: INT. FOSTER HOME, SIMI VALLEY - BEDROOM - DAY
text: A Degas print, “The Dancers,” hangs on one wall next to pink
text: ballet shoes. A _girl’s room complete with pink curtains, a
text: pink bedspread and a vanity. Davey stares out the open
text: window through a dirty screen, watching--
scene_heading: EXT. FOSTER HOME - DAY
text: JUDY NEASY, very heavy, curly hair, efficient manner, and
text: RENEE, a nervous, wiry social worker. The women walk toward
text: the street, past a neglected front yard.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: You will be gentle with him... I
dialog: think he suffers from PTSD.
dialog: (off Judy’s clueless look)
dialog: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: These kids don’t need pity, they
dialog: require structure and discipline.
dialog: That’s my gift to them.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: It's just that his mother--
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Stop. You already told me. Separate
dialog: yourself from your job, Renee.
dialog: They‘re not your children.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Of course. You’re right. I know
dialog: you are.
text: They arrive at a van with a red decal parked curb side:
scene_heading: VENTURA CHILDREN & FAMILY SERVICES
text: Renee turns to the bedroom window, sees Davey. She waves.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST STARLIGHT - LOCOMOTIVE - MOVING - DAY
text: The long, massive train barrels out of downtown Los Angeles.
text: Piles of brick, lumber and coils of sheet steel are stacked
dialog: out back by their respective warehouses -- The private parts
text: of American Industry, only visible from the train.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - COACH - MOVING - DAY
text: HOWIE PUGH, the conductor, now with a headset, grins...
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: Romeo...
text: He checks his watch, removes the headset and gets on the
text: intercom. PASSENGERS settle in reclining seats.
speaker_heading: HOWIE (V.0.)
dialog: Welcome to the Coast Starlight.
dialog: We're happy to have you on board.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - COACH - MOVING - DAY
text: Another packed car. An ELDERLY COUPLE holds hands. A WOMAN
text: leafs through a fashion magazine. Her teenage DAUGHTER puts
text: on lipstick, using a small compact.
speaker_heading: HOWIE (V.O)
dialog: Tom Stark, our #1 Engineer, and
dialog: Otis Petalas, the #2 Engineer will
dialog: take you all the way to Oakland...
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - LOCOMOTIVE - MOVING ~ DAY
text: Tom watches as the train speed increases on his display
text: screen - in green letters it climbs from 5 to 10 MPH. Otis
text: tapes the train orders to the locomotive’s back wall/divider.
speaker_heading: HOWIE (V.0.)
dialog: ..-For those of you continuing to
dialog: Seattle, lean back, relax and enjoy
dialog: the ride...
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Tom, deeply sad, watches as Megan, in T-shirt and jeans, goes
text: to the closet. She takes out a nightgown.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: There's going to be a hearing. I
dialog: have to be here to find out when.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Good. An official excuse.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It's not an excuse. If I’m absent
dialog: at the hearing, I’ll lose my job.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You’re like sand, Tom. The harder
dialog: I try to hold you, the quicker you
text: slip through my fingers.
dialog: She exits to--
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Megan takes off her T-shirt, tosses it in the laundry bin.
text: She opens her bra. A white sponge falls to the tile floor.
text: She picks it up and puts it on the counter. She studies her
text: image in the mirror. A mastectomy scars her left side. In
text: comparison, her remaining breast is supple and young.
text: She turns on the water. She grabs a washcloth, wets it and
text: rubs her face, her arms, her breast. She scrubs harder and
text: harder as if trying to scrub away her illness.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Tom studies the light filtering into the room from under the
text: bathroom door. He hears the water running, then muffled sobs.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Tom enters, sees Megan crouched on the floor, crying. He
text: kneels by her side and pulls her tightly to him.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - LOCOMOTIVE ~ MOVING - DAY
text: The back door, connecting to the train, opens. Tom and Otis
text: turn. Howie, the conductor, enters with a tray of doughnuts
text: and coffee. He puts it down on a side table. The ride is so
text: smooth, the coffee doesn’t even stir.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: (to Otis)
dialog: Breakfast, Lover Boy.
text: Tom grins. Otis frowns.
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: (doing a feminine voice)
dialog: Romeo, oh, Romeo, my asshole’s
dialog: itchin’ - Could it be love?...
speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: Shut your trap, Jerk. Were you
dialog: eavesdropping on my radio again?
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: Darn! I forgot my preparation H...
text: He sends Otis an air kiss and leaves. Tom takes a doughnut.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: I’m gonna file a complaint. I’m
dialog: nailing that nosy bastard.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Relax. You still taking classes?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Sure I am.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Accounting 101?
speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: Intermediate Accounting III. If
dialog: you were smart, you’d be going too.
dialog: Trains. It’s a dying business.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - OFFICE - DAY
text: DR. OFFENBERGER, 50’s, glasses, sits opposite Megan. She’s
text: in scrubs. Framed certificates hang on the wall behind her.
text: The doctor takes a pause before speaking.
scene_heading: DR. OFFENBERGER
dialog: I can’t answer that.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I won't hold you to it. Give me
dialog: your best guess.
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: DR. OFFENBERGER
dialog: You sure you want to know?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Please, Doctor.
text: He meets her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. FOSTER HOME - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Davey roughly wipes away tears from his eyes and looks around
text: the pink bedroom. He takes down the Degas print that hangs
text: on one wall next to pink ballet shoes. He stares at it a
dialog: brief moment, then CRASH!
text: He pounds the print with his fist as hard as he can. The
text: glass breaks, cutting his hand. Blood trickles over the
text: paper dancers. The pain is almost a relief. He chooses one
text: large shard and uses it to cut the window's screen. He
text: removes the pink pillowcase, wrapping it around his hand to
text: stop the bleeding. With his good hand, he grabs his train
text: from the bed and crawls out the window.
scene_heading: EXT. TAPO CANYON ROAD, SIMI VALLEY - DAY
text: Davey runs by this main thoroughfare, typical of Simi Valley
text: precisely laid-out, spiritually bereft streets. An
text: ambulance, sirens blasting, barrels down the street. He’s so
dialog: lonely, it hurts.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST STARLIGHT - DAY
text: Desert. The train is approaching a wide curve on the tracks.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - COACH - MOVING - DAY
text: Howie gets on the intercom...
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - SIGHTSEER LOUNGE - MOVING - DAY
text: PASSENGERS enjoy this second level lounge, surrounded by

speaker_heading: HOWIE (V.O.)
dialog: Hello Train Riders...
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - LOCOMOTIVE - MOVING - DAY
text: Tom puts the dynamic brake in reverse to slow down the train
dialog: because of the turn.
speaker_heading: HOWIE (V.O.)
dialog: ...We’re approaching beautiful Simi
text: Valley on schedule.
text: Otis watches as the train speed gradually decreases on Tom's
text: display screen - it drops from 65 to 58 MPH.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTER FOR INTUITIVE MEDICINE - GARDEN - DAY
text: A pond spurts water into the blue sky. Trees and rose bushes
text: with white blooms surround this secluded, pastoral
dialog: consultation area.
text: Megan, in the cotton dress, is on a garden chair next to Tom.
text: She flips through a brochure: “CENTER FOR INTUITIVE MEDICINE”
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I tried to plant flowers yesterday.
dialog: I didn’t do a very good job. We
dialog: should water the yard more often.
dialog: The dirt out there is so hard.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: This is a good place, you'll see.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: See what, Tom?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Chemo and hospitals are not our
dialog: only options.
text: SHEILA, 30's, an attractive woman wearing a sharp pantsuit,
text: approaches and sits with them. She offers Megan her hands.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Megan? I’m Sheila, it’s a pleasure
dialog: to meet you. Peace and love.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Hi, Tom.
dialog: (to Megan)
dialog: Tom thinks we can help you.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: SHEILA (cont'd)
dialog: He was very convincing on the
dialog: phone. Did you browse through our
dialog: brochure?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
text: Briefly.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: We're a center for alternative
dialog: approaches to treat or ameliorate
dialog: disease. We offer applied
dialog: kinesiology, cupping, and even
dialog: electromagnetic therapy.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Can you cure me?
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: We're one of the best centers in
dialog: the country.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You didn’t answer my question.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: Tom tells us you’re a nurse. As a
dialog: professional from the medical
dialog: field, you know there are no
dialog: guarantees. However, we can try to
dialog: rejuvenate your system, teach you a
dialog: number of relaxation techniques.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I don’t want to relax. I want to
dialog: live.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: For Christ's sake Megan, will you
dialog: just listen to her?
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: That's alright, Tom. Of course you
dialog: want to live, Megan, but—-
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: And I intend to spend the rest of
dialog: my life doing exactly what I want.
dialog: Electromagnetic therapy is not on
dialog: my list.
text: She rises and leaves. Tom, upset, looks at Sheila.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: SHEILA
dialog: (smiling patiently)
dialog: Give her time. She‘ll come around.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST STARLIGHT - LOCOMOTIVE - MOVING - DAY
text: The engine enters the curve. The long train follows. Cars
text: barrel over the turn in the road.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - SIGHTSEER LOUNGE — MOVING - DAY
text: PASSENGERS doze off. A TEENAGER rocks with his Walkman. A
text: FATHER and his CHILD watch the front portion of the train, as
text: it negotiates the curve. Squalid apartment buildings go by.
speaker_heading: CHILD
dialog: Where are the trees and deer?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: We'll see lots of trees after we
dialog: cross the desert.
speaker_heading: CHILD
dialog: What’s that? Over there...
text: The child points ahead. There’s something on the tracks.
scene_heading: INT. LINCOLN - DAY
text: Laura holds onto Davey, trying to subdue him with the last

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No, Mom! No!
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Shh...Shh... It‘1ll be over soon.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Let go!
text: He tries to pull up the lock on his door, but it won’t budge.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I wish you would stay with me...
text: He reaches to her side and presses the “unlock” button. A
text: CLICK sounds. The locks pop open.
dialog: 19.
text: Wriggling himself free of his mother’s grasp, he opens the
text: car door, grabs his train and jumps out onto the tracks.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - LOCOMOTIVE - MOVING - DAY
text: Otis pours himself a glass of milk. Tom finishes his

speaker_heading: TOM
text: Object on the tracks.
text: Otis squints. The Lincoln is a blur on the tracks ahead.
speaker_heading: oTIs
dialog: Jesus Christ.

speaker_heading: DAVEY

scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN - DAY
text: Gray plumes of smoke billow into the hazy afternoon air. The

text: might. He grabs the rail and swings onto the ladder at the
text: back of the car.
text: He clings to the narrow iron ladder, panting and laughing,
text: high on endorphins and youth. The train, as if rebelling
text: against his intrusion, moves faster. But the boy climbs and

text: Renee, the wiry social worker, escorting Davey to a parked
text: van with the red decal: “VENTURA CHILDREN & FAMILY SERVICES.”
text: The boy suddenly looks up and clashes into Tom’s eyes. He
text: stares, transfixed. Then, he screams across the way--
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: YOU DIDN'T STOP!
text: Tom looks away, out into the distance.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE, FRESNO CALIFORNIA - DAY
text: Fairly dark in spite of the bright day outside. The door
text: opens. Little Tom, 9, barrels in with a tattered school bag.
text: AUNT ROSE and UNCLE ADAM rise from the dilapidated couch.
dialog: They’re ordinary Fresno farmers and look it, except that Aunt
text: Rose’s eyes are red and puffy.
speaker_heading: LITTLE TOM
dialog: Aunt Rose!
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: AUNT ROSE
dialog: Oh, Tom...
text: She goes to him and holds him tight, sobbing. Uncle Adam
text: holds his hat in hands, uncomfortable with this blatant
dialog: display of emotions.
speaker_heading: LITTLE TOM
dialog: Why are you crying?
text: She's too distraught to answer. He notices a frayed suitcase
text: at Uncle Adam's feet.
speaker_heading: LITTLE TOM
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: UNCLE ADAM
dialog: There was a fire at the factory
dialog: Tom, and your mother, well, she...
speaker_heading: LITTLE TOM
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: UNCLE ADAM
dialog: You'll be living with us now. Come
dialog: on, Son. Rose. We need to be on
dialog: our way.
text: He picks up Tom’s suitcase and goes to the door. The boy
text: looks around, stunned.
speaker_heading: LITTLE TOM
dialog: Mom?
text: He runs to the kitchen. Aunt Rose rises in tears. Little
text: Tom comes back in.
speaker_heading: AUNT ROSE
dialog: She’s gone, Tom.
speaker_heading: LITTLE TOM
speaker_heading: MOM!
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN STATION, SIMI VALLEY - NIGHT
text: A sign reads:
scene_heading: WELCOME TO SIMI VALLEY
text: Clean and lit, almost homey. PASSENGERS, on waiting-area
text: benches, eat, read and talk. Nearby, Davey, clutching his
text: train, scans the fair chart. One entry on it informs:
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: “SIMI VALLEY TO LOS ANGELES: $10.00 ONE WAY. $20.00 ROUND
speaker_heading: TRIP.”
text: It might as well be a million. His gaze wanders aimlessly
text: around the station when he spots his answer: SHARON, a
text: pierced, tattooed teenage girl sleeping against a duffel bag
text: on one bench. She sticks out like a stain on a Sunday suit.
text: He moseys over and plumps down next to her, or more exactly
text: next to her army-style boots. He furtively glances over.
text: The girl is sound asleep. A wallet sticks out from her back
text: pocket, attached to her jeans with a silver chain. He inches
text: his way toward her wallet. He checks the terrain. No one
text: notices. No one cares. He gently yanks the chain, pulls out
text: the wallet and opens it.
text: SMACK! Sharon hits his hand, very awake.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Way too slow. That's your problem.
text: Alarmed, he tries to hightail it, when the girl grabs his
text: shirt, planting him firmly on the bench.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I was only gonna borrow it.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (glib)
dialog: Sure, you were gonna give it back.
dialog: Think the cops will buy your story?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Please don’t call them.
dialog: (taking out the quarter
dialog: from his pocket)
dialog: Take it. That’s all I have.
text: She glances at the quarter in his hand, unimpressed and lets
text: him go. She pulls out a cigarette. He’s too scared to move.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Want one?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You can't smoke here.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Look who's talking. Tony Soprano
dialog: of Simi Valley.
dialog: 40.
text: She lights the cigarette and finds a bag of Twinkies in her
text: backpack. She puts it on the bench between them. He slowly
text: reaches for it. She notices the deep cut in his right hand:
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What happened to your hand?
text: He takes a Twinkie, nearly swallowing it whole.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: If you give me ten dollars, I'1l
dialog: send them back when I get to Los
dialog: Angeles.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: What are you going there for?
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: Come on. It’s a secret? Level
dialog: with me. You a runaway?
dialog: (he nods)
dialog: Mother or father?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Foster home.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: No shit. Join the frickin’ club.
text: She rises, tosses the cigarette on the floor and squashes it
text: with her boot. She traverses the short distance to the ticket
text: window. Davey watches her while eating the other Twinkie.
text: Sharon returns to the bench, holding a ticket. She hands it
text: to him. He takes it, speechless.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: You welcome. It’s good karma.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well? The last train leaves in
dialog: five minutes.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I‘1l pay you back.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Tell you what. Send it to my
text: sister. She's in a foster home too.
text: She takes out a pen from her bag.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Give me that ticket.
dialog: 41.
text: He does -- reluctantly. She scribbles an address on it and
text: gives it back, much to Davey’s relief.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Good luck.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, SIMI VALLEY - DAY
text: Megan, in a summery cotton dress, gets out of the car and
text: inspects the barely-readable address on this miserable-
text: looking building, ironically named:
scene_heading: SIMI VALLEY ROYALE
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
text: Megan studies the rusty mail boxes. She finds what she
dialog: wants: “Danner. 202.”
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING ~ HALLWAY - DAY
text: Megan carefully advances down the dreary hallway. She gets
text: to 202. It’s just a door with grease spots and yellow police
dialog: tape. What was she expecting to find anyway?
text: Spent, she leans against the door; it narrowly opens.
text: Someone forgot to lock up. She pushes the door in, exposing
text: the squalid, filthy living room - only years of neglect can
text: do this. She takes in the ruin of Laura and Davey’s life.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN (0.S.)
dialog: (British accent)
dialog: I fancy they’re long gone.
text: Startled, Megan turns. Mrs. Brown, the oddly formal British
text: woman, frowns at her.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: The officers. They collected their
text: evidence and left.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You knew them?
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: Laura and Davey? I suppose so.
dialog: You look a bit pale, deary.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I could sit for a moment.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: Lovely. I‘11 fix us a cupper.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOUSE ~ LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Tom opens the door. It’s Otis.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Hey, Tom. Sorry to disturb you at
dialog: home. Can we talk?
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY
text: Tom installs a piece of track. Otis, surprised, checks out
dialog: the model tracks.
speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: I had no idea you were into model
dialog: trains.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Something wrong with that, Romeo?
speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: No, and I don’t need anybody's shit
dialog: right now.
text: Tom puts the tracks down. He goes to the door.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Let’s get out of here.
scene_heading: EXT. MONUMENT PARK, SIMI VALLEY - NIGHT
text: Davey climbs up a slope speckled with tall weeds. Something
text: moves behind him. He freezes, then quickly turns. Every
text: tree and bush is ominous and sinister.
text: A_lonely bird lands on a branch nearby. It watches him. He
text: stares back.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: (scaring the bird)
speaker_heading: AHHH!
text: It doesn’t move. He bends, picks up a small rock from the
text: ground and throws it at the bird.
dialog: 43.
text: He misses by an inch, but the stubborn thing won't budge or
text: even flutter. A shiver runs down his spine. He looks
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Mom?
text: The bird flies away. He shakes his head, dismissive, and
text: continues up the incline. He settles on one spot and
text: carefully sits, unraveling the pink pillowcase wrapped around
text: his hand. He flinches. The cloth has stuck to a deep, open
text: wound; it now removes pieces of his skin as it comes undone.
scene_heading: INT. MRS. BROWN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: It’s a bit like a doll’s house with doilies and whatnots
text: occupying every available corner. Megan, uneasy, is perched
text: on the sofa. Mrs. Brown enters with a teapot and cups. She
text: sits, puts a cup in front of Megan and takes one for herself.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: We'll let it brew a while.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You're very kind.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: I've lived next door to Laura for
dialog: five years. We were no bosom
dialog: buddies, but you live next to
dialog: someone for that long, you get to
dialog: know them in an intimate way.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: She ever mention suicide to you?
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: You ARE a nosy one. Poking!
dialog: Snooping! How did you find us?
dialog: Who sent you!
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Laura is listed. Call information
dialog: if you don’t believe me.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: Oh, dear...dear...dear...
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: Trying times, indeed. Cookies?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: No, thanks. Really.
dialog: 
dialog: 44,
text: But Mrs. Brown is already up and on her way to the kitchen.
text: Megan is impatient...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (calling toward kitchen)
dialog: You were saying, about Laura...
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN (0.S.)
dialog: I looked after her son here and
dialog: there. Bless her.
text: Mrs. Brown returns, munching on butter cookies. She sets the
text: plate on the table. Megan smiles cordially.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: Couldn't help but notice all the
text: men coming and going out of her
dialog: apartment. Of course, no one’s
dialog: been around in ages, but they used
text: to flock to her like hungry birds.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: They stopped coming?
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
text: She had a breakdown. A nerves
dialog: disease. Monstrous, isn’t it? The
dialog: tricks our mind plays on us... Tea?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You think she wanted to die, then?
text: Mrs. Brown pours imaginary tea from the pot. First in
text: Megan’s cup, then in hers. Megan watches her, baffled.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: Hard to say, isn’t it? Maybe she
dialog: did. Maybe she didn’t.
dialog: (sipping imaginary tea)
dialog: Quite good. Don’t be shy. Try it.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My cup is empty.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: Nonsense. Don’t be scared, Love.
dialog: I made it me-self.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (rising)
dialog: I should go.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: You haven‘t had your tea!
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: ("sipping” her tea...)
dialog: Mmmm... Very good.
speaker_heading: MRS. BROWN
dialog: Lovely.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - NIGHT
text: Davey looks up at a large sign:
scene_heading: WELCOME TO UNION STATION, LOS ANGELES
text: A cavernous marble hall with tall ornate ceilings, black
text: marble floors and fabulous chandeliers. Davey furtively
text: passes a tall ticket counter. The two CLERKS inside are busy
text: talking. He continues down to one door: “Authorized
dialog: Personnel Only.”
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Davey makes his way down the marble hallway carefully
text: examining the pictures that adorn the wall: Union Station in
text: the 30‘s and 40’s. N.B. comes out of one office with an
text: ENGINEER. Davey hugs the wall.
speaker_heading: ENGINEER
dialog: Tough break. Tom loves his train.
text: They go into another office without noticing him. The door
text: closes behind them. Davey continues down to the--
scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT
text: Davey, holding his train, is face-to-face with a real, live
text: docked train. He runs his fingers along one car. He sees the
text: ladder in the back and places his toy engine on the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST STARLIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Davey gets to the end of the ladder. He looks down at the
text: tangle of wires and steel connecting his car to the next one.
text: He steps off the ladder and onto the roof, careful not to put
text: too much pressure on his injured right hand.
dialog: 46.
text: Slowly, he straightens himself and takes a few steps. It’s
text: scary. From his vantage point he can see the gigantic station
text: building and more trains. Docked trains, resting like beached
text: whales on their track.
text: He continues to walk. Faster and faster. He stumbles, loses
text: his balance and almost slips off of the car. Determined, he
text: straightens up and looks ahead. He runs. He gets to the end
text: of the car - jumps.
text: He just makes it, landing hard on the adjacent car’s roof,
text: his body slamming against the cold, hard metal. Victorious,
text: he rises and looks up at the dark sky.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I’m not scared of you! Do you hear
dialog: me? I’M NOT SCARED!
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY
text: Tom and Megan in the cotton dress.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What do you want? What do you want
dialog: me to do?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: What happened to us?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What are you talking about.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You heard me.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Meggie...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Don’t “Meggie” me. I’m not some
dialog: fragile thing!
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What do you want from me!
speaker_heading: MEGAN
text: I WANT TO KNOW WHY WE NEVER HAD
dialog: CHILDREN! !
text: He pulls over to the curb. They sit there a moment, treading
text: on dangerous ground now.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We didn’t find the right time.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You kept moving us around. Fourteen
dialog: homes in fifteen years of marriage.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: That's what trainmen do. They move
dialog: with the trains.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Not all of them! It’s not a rule.
dialog: It’s what we did. Who could have a
dialog: child like that?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You got sick.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You're blaming me?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I‘'m not blaming anyone. It just
dialog: happened that way.
text: She absorbs his words, swallowing the lump in her throat.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I thought I had all this time. To
text: be a woman, a nurse, a mother.
dialog: Then I found out I didn’t. Things
dialog: that weren’t urgent before suddenly
dialog: took on a whole new meaning.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I was never sure I’d make a good
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I’m not afraid to die but to think
dialog: I haven't lived, that terrifies me.
scene_heading: EXT. COAST STARLIGHT - PLATFORM - DAY
text: PASSENGERS board the train, passing a sign that reads:
scene_heading: UNION STATION - LOS ANGELES
text: Vince, the engineer, heads to the locomotive.
dialog: 48.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - BATHROOM - DAY
text: Davey, washing his face and hair in the small sink, tries to
text: make himself presentable. He's careful with his right hand
text: that has the nasty, deep cut. His clothes are filthy.
scene_heading: INT. COAST STARLIGHT - COACH CAR - DAY
text: Howie, in conductor's uniform, goes by. Davey exits the

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You the conductor?
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I’m looking for my Uncle Tom.
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: Never heard of him.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: He drives this train.
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: You mean, Tom Stark? I didn’t know
dialog: he had relatives.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: He has a sister. I want to

speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: Sorry, Kid. Tom’s off duty because

speaker_heading: HOWIE

scene_heading: INT. BAR - DUSK
text: A working man’s joint. Country music plays in the b.g. TRUCK
text: DRIVERS wash down the road at the bar. Tom and Otis are at
text: one table. ROSANNA, cheap highlights and expensive cleavage,
text: serves Otis a coffee and puts a beer in front of Tom.
speaker_heading: ROSANNA
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We're good.
text: She gives Tom a sultry smile and leaves.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I think she likes you.

speaker_heading: OTIS

speaker_heading: oTis

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: OTIS

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You do that now and you‘ll make it

speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: But we did, Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We didn’t have a choice, damn it.
speaker_heading: oTiIs
dialog: We didn’t?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: If we had put the train on
dialog: emergency, the wheels would have
dialog: flattened. We would have derailed.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: We'll never know for sure.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No. We won't. It was a judgment
dialog: call, and I made it.
dialog: (trying a different tact)
dialog: Look, you don’t have it so bad.
dialog: You’re good at what you do. You're

speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: And the guys hate me for it.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Screw them.
dialog: (to BARTENDER; re: beer)
dialog: Can I get another?
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: We killed a human being - a person.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It was a suicide!
speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: The homeless man was my first one -

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Why don’t we talk about something
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: TOM (cont'd) .
dialog: Tell me, what's it like being a
dialog: bachelor nowadays? You pick up the
dialog: girls in accounting class?
speaker_heading: oTiIs
dialog: It was right before the end of the
dialog: shift. We had a smooth ride for
dialog: ten hours. I was looking at the
dialog: clock and thinking that we were
dialog: making good time, might even be
text: fifteen minutes early coming into
text: LA. Then I see him. Standing on
text: the tracks, gazing up at the sky,
text: clear as day in the spotlight, and
dialog: we blow the horn and ring the bell,
text: but he ignores us.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: They turn us into executioners.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: You know what he did right before
dialog: we hit him? He smiled at us.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: He had a death wish. Some people
dialog: do. Other people don’t want to die
dialog: and they die anyway.
text: This wasn’t easy to say. He drinks. Otis pauses, then:
text: He rises.
speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: I‘ll wait until the hearing’s done.
dialog: I'll give N.B. my notice then.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Fine. Do that.
dialog: Otis does too.
speaker_heading: OTIS
dialog: Don’t be an asshole.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I have no need for a quitter.
text: He throws some money on the table.
speaker_heading: oTis
dialog: Everything in your life is dying
dialog: and you just can’t deal with it.
text: Tom punches him. Hard. Otis falls to the floor. His
text: glasses break.
dialog: 52.
text: He springs up and tries to hit Tom, but misses. Tom punches
text: him in the stomach. Otis doubles over. Tom is ready to
text: pounce on him when the very LA Bartender runs over with a
dialog: golf club.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Get out! Now!
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - NIGHT
text: A strip mall. Otis gets into his car. Tom is blinded by rage.

scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY
text: Tom, face distorted in rage and sorrow, rises from the floor
text: and looks at his railroad. Shiny model trains sit on
text: miniature tracks. He sends his fist into the tracks.
text: CRASH!! Bits of plastic and metal go everywhere. A plastic
text: “passenger” plunges to the floor.
text: He turns to another section. CRASH!! The “mountain scenery”
text: behind the tracks breaks in two. A yellow WESTERN PACIFIC
text: model train tumbles down. Methodically he goes around the
text: tracks breaking section after section. He stops to study the
text: destruction. The chaos that is his life.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

text: margined by his broken railroad. She puts her suitcase down
text: and takes in the ruin around them. He rises.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I was scared of losing you because
dialog: everyone I cared about left me.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: It’s too late, Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I thought if I didn’t get
dialog: comfortable, if I kept us on the
dialog: move and didn’t settle down it
dialog: wouldn’t be so hard if you left me
dialog: too.
text: She goes to him and gives him a hug. Then:
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Walk me to the door?
text: He nods, choked-up, and takes her suitcase. They walk out.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Megan and Tom enter. He stops.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I can’t let you go.
speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Tom?
text: Mad with anger and grief, Davey unleashes a barrage of
text: punches on Tom.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You didn’t stop!

speaker_heading: MEGAN

text: Tom manages to pin Davey against the wall.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You had time! You didn’t stop!
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Tom! Let him go.
text: He does. Tom and Davey, at a stand off, glare at each other.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Why are you angry with Tom?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: He killed my mother!
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: She killed herself.
speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: DAVEY

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It doesn’t say.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (pointing to book)
dialog: Right here. If you can picture a
dialog: train going very fast--
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You mean if it runs over 50 MPH.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Right. And the engineer decides to
dialog: use the emergency brake instead of
dialog: slowing it down, then--
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: There’s a 60% chance the train will
dialog: derail. That’s what it says?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: But that’s not for sure.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It was a chance I couldn’t take.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Because your tail was on the turn?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: And I had three hundred passengers.
text: The train was packed.
text: Davey pauses, conflicted between his love for trains and his
dialog: rage for Tom.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It almost always is.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It’s a popular route.
text: Megan joins them at the table with an alcohol rub and a
text: bandage. She cleans Davey’s wound expertly. He winces.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: It will only hurt for a second.
text: She quickly fans it with her hand to soothe his pain.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: What do they call you?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Davey.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: That’s a nice name.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: How did you find me?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I went on the train.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What train?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Who’s taking care of you now?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No one.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Don’t you have any family?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: They put me in a foster home.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (to Megan)
dialog: We should call the police.
text: A KNOCK. They exchange tense glances.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: If they're not here already. Shit!
text: He rises. Davey looks at Megan, alarmed.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Don’t go anywhere. It'll be okay.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Megan and Tom, confused, stare at two husky WORKMEN. A

speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: Megan Stark?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: We have your piano.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: My...piano?
dialog: (giddy with relief)
dialog: Of course! My piano!
text: He hands her an invoice. She happily takes it.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: Where do you want it?
text: She points to a corner by some moving boxes.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: There. Thank you.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What piano?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I ordered it a few days ago.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh.

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: What are we going to do?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Get him out of here.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Let him stay.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Just for one day.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: They’1l fire me. I can’t have
text: contact with a victim's family.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Did you see his clothes? Did you
dialog: see his face? His mother just died.
speaker_heading: TOM
text: Someone must be looking for him.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Tom, if he’s leaving now, I'm going
dialog: with him.
text: She returns to the kitchen, leaving him to watch the workmen
text: as they uncover a black, baby grand piano.
speaker_heading: WORKMAN
dialog: Congratulations. It’s a nice one.
scene_heading: INT. FOSTER HOME, SIMI VALLEY - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Judy enters. Davey’s not around. She goes to the closet.
speaker_heading: JUDY
dialog: Ready to say you're sorry?
text: She opens the closet door. He's not there. Now she notices
text: the shattered glass. The open window... She hurries out.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Davey tries to eat his eggs politely, yet he’s so hungry he
text: can’t chew fast enough. Megan, sitting opposite him, smiles.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: More?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No, thank you.
text: Having scrubbed the plate clean, he rises, taking his dishes
text: to the sink. He opens the faucet. She watches him, surprised.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Washing my dishes.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: DAVEY

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: It’'s okay. Really.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
text: Tom, edgy, leafs through the newspaper on the couch. Megan

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Do you play, Davey?
text: He shakes his head “no.” Tom stares at him. Megan takes
text: Davey out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - BATHROOM
text: Davey soaks in a bubble bath. His train is on the floor next
text: to him. Megan opens the door slightly.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: How are you doing in there?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Good, ma‘’am.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Call me Megan.
text: She puts some clothes on the floor and closes the door. He
text: takes a sponge and scrubs himself.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOUSE - TOM’S OFFICE - DAY
text: It's really the storage room. A few boxes are stacked on the
text: desk. Others are scattered throughout. Megan covers the
text: futon with colorful sheets. Tom peers in the doorway.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
text: Taking a bath. He's so polite.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Strange kid. Too grown-up.
text: She pushes some boxes out of the way. He helps her.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You can’t imagine how he was
dialog: raised.
dialog: (off Tom's puzzled look)
dialog: I went to see his home yesterday.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Whose home?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
text: Davey and Laura's. In Simi Valley.
text: She goes into one box, takes out pictures of Tom with steam
text: engines and freight trains. He stares at her in disbelief.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Why would you do that?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: To find out if she really wanted to
dialog: die.
speaker_heading: TOM
text: She put her car on the tracks,
dialog: didn’t she? Goddamnit, Megan!
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: It was important to me. A woman
dialog: died, and you seemed to only care
dialog: about your suspension... Tom, you
dialog: should have seen their home. It
dialog: was awful. Terrible.
text: She places the train photos on the empty bookcase. He takes
text: one and studies it in a gesture of reconciliation.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Where’d you find them?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: They've been here. I think he’1l
dialog: like them.
text: Davey enters in one of Tom’s T-shirts. He holds his train
text: and stands there, awkward. Megan smiles. Without the layer
text: of dirt, Davey is a handsome boy.
scene_heading: INT. DEPT. OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES - OFFICE - DAY
text: The wiry social worker is at her messy desk, on the phone.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: ++-I‘1l notify the police,
dialog: Judy...Thanks.
text: Aggravated, she slams the phone, digs in her drawer, takes
text: out a cigarette and lights it. She inhales, then:
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Crap.
text: Since the desk doesn’t have an inch to spare, files are
text: stacked on the worn carpet. She bends to the floor and finds
text: a folder there: DAVID DANNER.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY
text: Megan puts Davey’s clothes in the washer and starts it. She
text: picks up his sad, torn sneakers, wipes them clean.
scene_heading: INT. TOM’S OFFICE - DAY
text: The room is neater now. Davey studies a train photo just
text: like Tom did. Megan enters with a mug of hot chocolate.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: We better put you in bed.
text: Reluctantly, he goes to the futon.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: No one sleeps in the daytime unless
dialog: they’re sick.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
text: Tom sleeps during the day.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: He does?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: If you don’t fall asleep, we‘ll
dialog: think of something to do.
text: He gets in bed, sitting up. She gives him the hot chocolate.
text: He sips from it.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You're not gonna make me pray?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: My mom liked me to pray a lot.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: You can if you want to.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Not right now.
text: She caresses his hair.
speaker_heading: MEGAN

text: another box.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I guess we're staying a while.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I think we will.
text: His eyes drift to her packed suitcase. It still sits by the

text: She watches, as he carries her suitcase up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. SIMI VALLEY POLICE DEPARTMENT - DUSK
text: Spacious, clean, well-funded. POLICE OFFICERS chat, drink

dialog: Alright. She’s a disciplinarian.
dialog: But I got him on such short notice,
dialog: and I thought that after...well,
text: after living with a psychotic
dialog: mother, discipline might be good
dialog: for him.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'm sure you meant well.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Do you have a picture?
text: Renee opens her folder, takes out a school photo of Davey and
text: hands it to Christian.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: We'll circulate it to our patrol
dialog: units.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: You will find him, won't you?
dialog: 64.
text: Christian and Ann exchange glances.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Maybe you could start with train

dialog: holding this little toy train--
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Renee. May I call you Renee?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Yes. Please.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: In 2004 alone, over one hundred
dialog: thousand children were reported
dialog: missing in California. Most of
dialog: them were runaways.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I’m a social worker. You think I
dialog: don’t know the statistics?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Then you should realize chances are
dialog: we'll never find him. Never.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: It’s starting to look like home. Megan, taking a break from

text: touching the keys.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I don’t want to wake him.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You won‘t.

speaker_heading: MEGAN

scene_heading: EXT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOME - TOM’S OFFICE - DAWN
text: Megan sleeps on a chair opposite Davey - she’s obviously been

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Good morning.

scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOME - GARAGE - DAY
text: Tom works on the tracks. Megan watches him.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I wish we could keep him.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You promised - one day.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: He needs us.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We would be breaking the law. Isn’t
dialog: it like kidnapping or something?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: So?! They won’t reinstate me if
dialog: they find out he was here even for
dialog: one day.
dialog: (different tact)

scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

speaker_heading: MEGAN
text: Working on his railroad.
speaker_heading: DAVEY

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: They're broken.
speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: TOM

dialog: (to Megan)
dialog: You ready?
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: That's our number. If you need
dialog: anything, just call me, okay?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I don’t want to go back there.
speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: DAVEY

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Yes.

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What are you afraid of?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Nothing. I don’t want anyone
dialog: seeing you, is all.

text: Megan, at the window, takes a step back. She runs out.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

dialog: Was it a bad dream?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I was pretending.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Pretending what?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: That you’re my mother, and we were
dialog: like a family. I told Tom my mom
dialog: was like you. That she cooked and
dialog: helped me with homework, but she
dialog: didn’t. Not in a long time.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I’m sure she did her best for you.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: She tried real hard.
speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: DAVEY

dialog: me for Christmas when I was six.
dialog: He must have really liked trains.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did your father like trains?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I never knew him.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I didn’t know mine either.
text: Tom takes that in. Davey dips his brush in black and paints

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It's a bird.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Tom watches Megan and Davey play “Chopsticks” together.

text: the bed and takes it. Tom enters from the bathroom, his hair
text: combed back. He strikes a pose at the door. She laughs.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Sexy stuff, huh?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Irresistible.
dialog: 78.
text: He goes to the bed, collects her in his arms.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I want to be your man.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Silly. You are my man.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Will you be my woman?
text: He takes an elongated box from the night stand and hands it
text: to her. She opens it. A delicate necklace lies inside.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Tom! We can't afford this.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Repeat after me: Happy...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Happy.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Anniversary.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Anniversary... The years went by
dialog: so fast, yet certain moments are so
dialog: clear in my mind.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: The first time you talked to me at
dialog: the diner.
text: He gently lays her down. He kisses her, passionately.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Our first train ride. You remember?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Every detail. I love you so much,
dialog: my Meggie.
text: He unbuttons her blouse. They kiss. His fingers study her

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: (reading)
dialog: “,..instincts long dead became

dialog: (to Megan)
dialog: What are, “instincts”?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: A feeling you get in your stomach
dialog: when something is right or wrong.
text: Tom enters with the mail. He goes through the envelopes and
text: opens an official-looking one from the National
dialog: Transportation Safety Board.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: (showing off for Tom)
dialog: “,..The domesticated generations
dialog: fell from him...”
text: But he stops reading, noticing that Megan is studying Tom’s
text: face as he scans the official-looking letter.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I have five days.
text: Upset, he leaves the letter on the table and...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I‘1l be in the garage.
text: He exits. Megan takes the letter, looks it over.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Five days for what?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Tom’s hearing. To decide if he did
dialog: the right thing in the accident.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What if they decide he didn’t do
dialog: the right thing?
speaker_heading: BO.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Then he won’t be an engineer
dialog: anymore. That’s okay. Tom’s
dialog: capable. He can do many things.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: There’s nothing like driving a
dialog: train.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOME - GARAGE - DAY
text: Tom and Davey work on the railroad. The broken tracks have

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: What do you call this one?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: UP 2-4-0.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s real nice.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Davey carefully puts it down and goes back to installing a
text: “mountain” behind the tracks.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I could tell ‘em she wanted to die.
text: Tom turns to him, perplexed.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I could say that at your trial.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It’s a hearing and, no, that’s
dialog: alright.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: You don’t want me to tell ‘em?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It doesn’t matter if your mother
dialog: wanted to die, what matters is if I
dialog: handled the situation correctly.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I forgive you.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Forgive me, for what? She took
dialog: away my options, when she put her
text: car in front of me.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Yes, she did.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It just so happened that she chose
dialog: my train.
speaker_heading: DAVEY

scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - DUSK
text: A sign reads:
scene_heading: WELCOME TO UNION STATION, LOS ANGELES

text: PASSENGERS waiting for their train or loved-ones.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION - REST AREA - DUSK
text: Vending machines, chairs, tables. ENGINEERS, STEWARDS and
text: other TRAIN EMPLOYEES eat, read the paper and gossip. Renee
text: hangs a flyer on the wall. She looks around. Everyone pretty

text: Howie, the conductor, and Vince, the engineer, enter. Howie,
text: brightening up, checks out Renee. He and Vince exchange
text: glances: Fresh meat! They approach.
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: What’s a pretty girl like you doing
dialog: in a train station all alone?
text: She hands them a flyer. Vince takes it, pretending to study
dialog: the photo.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I’m looking for a missing boy.
dialog: Maybe you've seen him?
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: Oh, yeah. We saw him. When’d we
dialog: see him, Howie?
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: (glancing at flyer)
dialog: Oh, he just left...
text: She’s not stupid. She snatches the flyer away from Vince.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Thanks a lot.
speaker_heading: VINCE
dialog: Sure...
text: The smile leaves Howie’s face. He reaches for the flyer.
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: Give me that.
text: He looks closely at Davey’s photo. She watches him.
speaker_heading: HOWIE
dialog: It’s Tom's nephew.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Who's Tom?
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
text: The neighborhood is eerily quiet. Tom and Megan take a walk.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: He said he forgave me for killing
dialog: his mother. It used to be so
dialog: simple. There was the right thing
dialog: to do and the wrong thing to do. I
dialog: mean, we're talking about trains.
dialog: It’s mechanics. There shouldn't be
text: a gray area.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Life is a gray area.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Not always. Some things you know
dialog: with certainty.
text: He looks in her eyes, kisses her.
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN'S HOME - DAVEY’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Megan tucks Davey in.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Good night, sleep tight, don’t let
dialog: Davey out of my sight...
text: She tickles him. He giggles.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: That's my prayer. You like it?
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s good, but you’re supposed to
text: say “amen” at the end.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: (serious; clearing throat)
dialog: Amen.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Megan? I‘ve been meaning to talk
dialog: to you about something.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Shoot.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: This girl bought my train ticket to
dialog: LA, and I promised I’d give her the
dialog: money back. It’s ten dollars.
text: Megan, touched, is speechless. Davey misreads her expression.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: I'll work for it. Clean the yard,
dialog: do the dishes, whatever you need.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I’ll go get it.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Wait.
text: He rises and takes his train. He fishes out the ticket stub
text: from the toy engine, and gives it to Megan. The address
text: Sharon jotted is on the back.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: Send it here. It’s for her sister.
text: She's in a foster home too.
dialog: 84,
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I’ll do it first thing tomorrow.
text: He puts the train back on the bookcase and gets back in bed.
text: She kneels next to him and kisses his forehead.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: (clasping hands in prayer)
dialog: God, dear God, take care of my mom,
dialog: her name is Laura Danner, and she
dialog: sleeps a lot and drinks a lot, but
dialog: she’s really a good woman, and she
dialog: likes You very much. Amen.

dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Nothing. She’s fine.
scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOME - BATHROOM - DAY

scene_heading: INT. TOM & MEGAN’S HOME - BEDROOOM - DAY

speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: There’s someone outside.
dialog: 85.
text: Tom rises, looks out the bedroom window: Renee’s van is

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Tom! Watch your language.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Department of Children and Family

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: RENEE

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No.
text: She notices Jack London's, The Call of the Wild. She picks

speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Great book. Do you have Children,
dialog: Mr. Stark?
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY
text: Davey, panicked, turns to Megan. She’s right behind him.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I forgot my book!
speaker_heading: MEGAN

dialog: Take my hand.
text: He does. She leads him to her bedroom.
speaker_heading: TOM (0.S.)
dialog: It’s my wife's.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM

speaker_heading: RENEE

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Megan and Davey enter. He turns to her:
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: It’s the woman who put me in that

scene_heading: INT. STAIRS
text: Renee heads up the stairs to the second floor. Tom follows.
speaker_heading: RENEE
text: He ran away from his foster home.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What’s it to me?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Mr. Howie Pugh? The train
dialog: conductor? He told me David was on
dialog: the train, looking for you.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: They reach the top of the stairs.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: He claimed to be your nephew.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: My nephew?
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Under the bed!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Renee looks at Davey’s room / Tom's office.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Do you mind?
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Sure I do. This is my home.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I'm sorry. It’s a terrible
dialog: imposition.
text: Nonetheless, she looks inside...
scene_heading: INT. DAVEY’S ROOM
text: Davey is a neat boy, as no clothes are lying around. Renee
text: take a quick inventory from the door: Train pictures, blue

speaker_heading: MEGAN (0.S.)
dialog: Tom? What’s going on?
dialog: She turns to--
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: Megan, in her robe, is at the end of the hall. She closes

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (to Renee)
dialog: My wife. Megan.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Sorry to barge in like this. I'm

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: (re: Davey’s room)
dialog: I couldn’t help notice that the bed
text: in this room is made and the walls
text: are freshly painted.
text: Megan, shivering, leans against the wall. Tom, genuinely
text: alarmed, goes to her. Renee, curious, studies Megan.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Megan nods.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: She's sick.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I have metastatic cancer. In my
dialog: case it means the cancer has spread
dialog: to my bones.
text: Renee is shocked. Megan's short hair, pale skin, thin frame,
dialog: take on a whole new meaning...
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I have trouble sleeping at night.
dialog: And when I do, I go into the spare
dialog: room. I don’t like disturbing my
text: husband. As for the walls, blue
dialog: always cheered me up.
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: You said that already.
speaker_heading: MEGAN

scene_heading: INT. VAN - DAY

speaker_heading: MEGAN

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR #1
dialog: For the record, were you Senior

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: It doesn’t work that way, Davey.
speaker_heading: DAVEY
dialog: But why?

dialog: you saw the car?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I went for the emergency brake.
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR #2
dialog: But you didn’t use it.
speaker_heading: TOM

dialog: not even the emergency mode.
speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR #2
dialog: Your partner thinks the impact
dialog: might have been prevented.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: TOM

speaker_heading: ADMINISTRATOR #2
dialog: If you could do it all over again,
