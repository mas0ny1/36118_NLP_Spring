speaker_heading: "MINORITY REPORT"
dialog: -- Aug 15th 1997 rewrite by Jon Cohen
speaker_heading: DARKNESS
text: And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
dialog: beautifully proportioned FACE.
text: The oval face is female, a woman of indeterminate age, her
text: features as fragile as porcelain. Her eyes are closed in
dialog: sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.
text: Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness. They are
text: male, and they float into position on either side of the
dialog: female. They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,
dialog: and like the female their eyes are closed.
text: The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch. Her features,
text: which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,
text: into the face of a woman in fear. Her eyes open.
text: The male face on her right contorts too. His features warp
text: into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged. His eyes
dialog: open.
text: The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young
text: boy, a boy who is terribly frightened. His eyes open wide.
dialog: As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a
dialog: sudden and unnerving exchange begins ...
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: (frightened woman)
speaker_heading: JOHNNY, PLEASE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE RIGHT
dialog: (mocking man)
dialog: "Johnny, please. Johnny please."
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: You're scaring me.
speaker_heading: MALE LEFT
dialog: (child's voice)
speaker_heading: DADDY, DON'T. DADDY
speaker_heading: MALE RIGHT
dialog: (considering)
dialog: I don't like you any more, Carol.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: (imploring)
dialog: Put the scissors down. You're scaring
dialog: me. Please.
speaker_heading: MALE RIGHT
dialog: Oh, Carol.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Johnny! Stop!
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: MALE RIGHT
dialog: Don't grab at me! Let
speaker_heading: MALE LEFT
dialog: Daddy! No!
text: All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but
dialog: we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a
text: man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream,
text: the whimpering cries of their son.
text: And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three
text: faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state.
text: Their eyes slowly close. They do not move.
dialog: So that when they do move again, it is startling. In abrupt
text: unison, the EYES flash open. Three pairs of eyes stare
dialog: straight at us, accusing.
text: Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one.
speaker_heading: ALL THREE
dialog: Murderer!
text: The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and
dialog: the dark reaches forth, and takes them.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: EXT. SUBURBIA DAY
dialog: Morning in America. Just look at it. America in the
dialog: midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into
dialog: the sun drenched distance. White house upon white house.
text: Emerald lawns, glistening with dew.
text: In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome,
text: long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships.
text: Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on
text: trikes. Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,
text: watching. The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go
dialog: back into their houses.
dialog: Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,
text: boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes. It
dialog: is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are
dialog: safe.
speaker_heading: INT. A HOUSE
dialog: A family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone
text: fireplace, a console TV, a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger,
text: a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of
text: children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 3.
text: A young mother, CAROL, her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a
text: picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly
dialog: at the scene outside.
speaker_heading: CAROL'S POV - A LITTLE GIRL
text: A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk. The ball
text: gets away from her, and rolls into the street.
text: At the same moment, a two-toned CHEVY, lush and huge, rounds
dialog: the corner.
text: The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.
speaker_heading: THE FAMILY ROOM
text: Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry
dialog: out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door. She
dialog: watches. And smiles a little.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CHEVY
text: The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white
text: shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of
dialog: the car.
text: Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel.
dialog: Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in
text: front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him.
text: Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road
text: in front of him, going for her ball.
text: CAROL Watches, her smile in place.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears
dialog: down on her.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CHEVY
text: An alarm suddenly CHIRPS. The car automatically brakes to a
text: halt. The man looks around the edge of his paper to see
dialog: what is happening.
speaker_heading: THE STREET
text: The car has stopped, inches from the girl.
text: The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.
text: She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 4.
text: The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on
text: its own, starts up again. The car rounds a corner, and
dialog: disappears.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE HOUSE
text: Carol turns away from the window. She startles when she
text: sees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her. He is in his
dialog: pajamas. How long has he been there, watching her?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (gruff)
dialog: Why'd you let me sleep so long?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why are you staring at me like that?
text: He takes a step toward her. He stands there, his thick black
text: hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw,
dialog: considering her.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so
dialog: long.
text: He takes another step toward her. She doesn't move a muscle.
text: A little BOY suddenly enters the room. Johnny turns, looks
text: at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife. Then,
text: without a word, he begins to walk out of the room. On his
text: way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which
text: sits beside a sewing machine. It is not the sewing that has
text: caught his attention, but a large pair of garment SCISSORS
text: which lie across a fold of colored cloth.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching. He walks down
text: his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.
text: Carol stands in the doorway, watching him.
text: A SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above. The air fills
text: with the piercing WHINE of an engine. Johnny looks up,
dialog: alarmed.
text: In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban
text: trees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.
dialog: The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone
text: freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable
dialog: drama.
text: Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK
dialog: TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they
dialog: seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat
dialog: Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to
dialog: process them.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 5.
text: Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.
text: More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses. Their
dialog: uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light. Their
text: left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some
dialog: sort of complicated glove.
speaker_heading: CLOSE
speaker_heading: ON - A GLOVE
dialog: The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger
text: ending in an open barrel.
dialog: Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not
dialog: America in the 1950's. It is the neo-past, the retro world
dialog: of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is
dialog: intermeshed with hypertechnology.
dialog: And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he
dialog: makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering
text: behind him. He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out
dialog: of the way.
text: Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a
text: backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a
text: handle grip and an ovoid screen. It is a holographic scanner.
text: He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an
text: IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.
text: The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver
dialog: a dozen times.
dialog: In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three
text: dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning
dialog: like living beings -- has been created. An overwhelming
dialog: police deterrent presence has been established.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE HOUSE
dialog: The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,
dialog: too. It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and
dialog: which are scanned holographs. The juxtaposition of the
text: futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.
speaker_heading: INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET
text: Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his
dialog: wife's dresses.
speaker_heading: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
text: Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands
text: out in front of them, palm out. When the first officer points
text: his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove
speaker_heading: BEEPS softly.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 6.
text: The officer looks at his PALM. A red thermal IMAGE appears
text: on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching
text: man. The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second
dialog: officer.
speaker_heading: THE BEDROOM
dialog: The room is packed with police -- how many are real?
speaker_heading: THE CLOSET
text: Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat. He calls
dialog: out through the door.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I didn't do anything!
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE THE CLOSET
text: Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points
text: his index barrel at the closet door. The effect is deeply
dialog: accusatory.
text: An OFFICER speaks, his VOICE electronically manipulated to
dialog: be as menacing as possible.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1
dialog: Come out of the closet on your hands
dialog: and knees.
text: Nothing happens. Two officers aim their barrels at the
text: perimeter of the door. In repeated, small SONIC BLASTS, the
text: closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing Johnny among
dialog: the dresses.
text: Johnny starts to rise, and BAM, a section of floorboards is
dialog: blasted away beneath his feet.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1
dialog: Hands and knees!
text: Johnny trips among the splintered floorboards, and drops.
text: He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches. He lifts
text: his head and looks up at the officer.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I didn't...
text: Another OFFICER 2 bends down with a DEVICE -- the words
dialog: "IdentiScan" on its side -- and blips a red laser light
text: into each of Johnny's, eyes, reading his irises. The
text: officer nods affirmatively to the other officer.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 2
speaker_heading: POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1
dialog: (to Johnny)
dialog: John Palmer, if you were being
dialog: arrested for any other crime, I would
dialog: now read you your rights.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you are under arrest for the
dialog: future murderer of your wife, Carol
dialog: Palmer. You have no rights.
text: Johnny, on his hands and knees, goes limp.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOUSE -- LATER
text: In the background, Johnny is guided into a Precrime police
text: vehicle as the neighbors look on. Carol and her son stand
text: in the doorway, stunned.
dialog: TWO OFFICERS remove their helmets. The first man is tall,
dialog: sandy-haired, good eyes, deeply blue; This is PAUL ANDERSON,
dialog: late thirties, Director of the Precrime Division, Washington
dialog: D.C.
dialog: The second man is ED WITWER, Anderson's second in command,
dialog: late thirties, big like Anderson, good face, strong in the
dialog: shoulders, short brown hair.
dialog: The two men are deeply comfortable together. They can speak,
dialog: or not. It doesn't matter -- they still communicate. Two
dialog: good cops, good together.
text: They walk side-by-side around the house, dematerializing the
dialog: holographic decoy cops.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Thought we might a had a runner.
text: Anderson seems tired, takes a moment to answer.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Yeah, a runner.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: A little chase -- that'd been good.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Fifty cops on the scene takes the
dialog: chase out of them.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: But only eight of us were real.
dialog: Witwer dematerializes the last decoy.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: We ever get a runner, I'd be too old
dialog: to give chase.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: You'd chase. You'd love it,. Man.
text: They get to the front of the house and watch the Precrime
text: vehicle holding Johnny zoom SOUNDLESSLY away.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I love it more Johnny boy doesn't
dialog: get to murder his wife.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's a beautiful world.
scene_heading: EXT. SAME SCENE -- LATER
dialog: The children play on their trikes. The wives talk among
dialog: themselves. The birds sing, the dogs bark.
text: The little girl bounces her red ball again. She stops a.
dialog: minute, when two pieces of newspaper blow past her,
text: unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape.
scene_heading: INT. A BEDROOM - SUBURBAN VIRGINIA (OUTSIDE WASHINGTON) DAY
text: Decorated in a 1950's style. Anderson lies in bed beside
text: his wife, LISA, a pretty, green-eyed brunette. It is early
text: morning, they are both awake. Her hand caresses his chest.
dialog: Maybe they will make love.
text: Lisa's hand stops suddenly on the center of Anderson's chest.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Jesus, Paul. Your heart's hammering.
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: I excite you that much?
text: He turns to her, and the grim set of his jaw makes her smile
dialog: vanish.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I used to love being a cop.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You're still a cop. I'm a factory
dialog: worker. We don't catch murderers.
dialog: We process them.
dialog: Lisa takes a long breath. She's been down this road before.
dialog: She speaks reassuringly.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You're the best homicide cop in the
dialog: country.
text: ANDERSON snorts disdainfully.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Great -- except there's no such thing
dialog: as homicide. What I do best doesn't
dialog: exist anymore.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: LISA
speaker_heading: PAUL.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're the Director of a perfect
dialog: system. A Cop with a perfect record
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: The Precogs have a perfect record.
dialog: They identify the accused -- I just
dialog: put on my monkey suit and go round
dialog: them up.
text: Lisa hugs him, kisses the back of his neck.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: And then I prosecute them. And they
dialog: go to jail. And lives are saved.
dialog: Thousands of lives.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And that's a cop's dream.
text: Anderson is silent for a time. He sighs, then smiles, and
text: turns to his wife, takes her in his arms.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: No. You're a cop's dream.
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHROOM -- LATER
text: Anderson steps out of the shower, and begins to towel himself
text: dry- He glances out a casement window. He tilts his head,
text: curious, then wipes at the steam on the window.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON'S POV LISA
text: Lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown, talking on a
text: cell phone. She hangs up, moves quickly back into the house.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
text: Cocks his head, then goes back to toweling off.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN -- LATER
text: Checkered linoleum floor. Appliances out of the 1950's.
dialog: Except there are little differences. When Lisa puts a skillet
dialog: of eggs on the stove, the heating element is not an electric
dialog: coil, or gas but a shimmering field of light.
text: Lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket.
text: Anderson wears a gray suit, thin blue tie, white shirt,
text: wingtipped shoes. He doesn't look up from the newspaper as
dialog: he speaks.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Who called?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 10.
text: Lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs. She touches
dialog: her long brown hair.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: No one. I called about my hair.
dialog: Getting it done this afternoon.
dialog: Anderson looks like he's about to say something else, when
text: suddenly someone RAPS on the back screen door. Anderson and
dialog: Lisa both turn and smile.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Come on in, neighbor. Want some
dialog: coffee?
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE THE DOOR
text: FRANK D'IGNAZIO, 65, white-haired, robust, hesitates before
text: coming in. A thin METALLIC ARM with a red laser light arches
text: quickly down from above the doorway, shines into each of his
text: EYES, scanning the irises. The arm lifts out of view, the
speaker_heading: screen door UNLATCHES.
text: Frank enters the kitchen, carrying a basket of tomatoes.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: Brought these for your supper.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Oh, Frank. That's so sweet. Thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: Sweet, nothing. I gotta get rid of
dialog: these things. One plant, and I'm
dialog: invaded by tomatoes. When I was a
dialog: kid ...
text: Anderson laughs, claps his friend and neighbor on the back,
dialog: teases him.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Before all this genetically engineered
dialog: crap ...
text: Frank gives him an ornery look, then a smile.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: Yeah well, it's true. It used to be
dialog: a challenge to grow things. An art.
dialog: Now you put one plant in the ground
dialog: -- then jump the hell out of the
dialog: way.
text: Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Coffee?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: Nah, thanks. Can't stay. You guys
dialog: are rushing off to work anyway.
text: Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You and Ellie come for supper then.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: We'll barbecue.
text: Frank nods and pushes on the screen door.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: You betcha. We'll bring some more
dialog: tomatoes -- a new batch will have
dialog: grown by then.
text: They all laugh, Frank exits, Anderson goes back to his paper.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY -- LATER
text: Anderson waves to Lisa. Her big Studebaker drives off down
text: the tree-lined street and away.
text: Anderson approaches his Chevy. He doesn't take out a key to
text: unlock it. There is no lock. He slides in behind the wheel.
dialog: Doesn't take out a key for the ignition -- there is no
dialog: ignition.
text: A thin METALLIC ARM arches down from the sun visor, scans
text: Anderson's EYES, identifying him. A seat harness wraps around
dialog: him, and the car STARTS.
text: Anderson picks up a folder marked "Precrime" and begins to
text: read through the papers. The Chevy backs out of the driveway
dialog: and takes him to work.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - ALEXANDRIA, VA -- LATER
dialog: A vast spread of corporate and government buildings -- the
dialog: spillover from Washington D.C. across the Potomac River into
dialog: Virginia.
dialog: Beyond the white of Washington is "The Sprawl" -- the massive
dialog: unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts
dialog: of the Capitol. It is impenetrable and uninviting, especially
dialog: to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs.
text: Anderson's Chevy moves in a sea of fifties-type cars.
text: Occasionally, an ultramodern vehicle zips past them. In the
dialog: sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles,
text: holographic billboards, hovercrafts, skim-jet transports.
text: On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to
dialog: flash: "I LIKE MIKE!"
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 12.
text: Then a picture of the smiling President appears. Then the
scene_heading: words: "RE-ELECT PRESIDENT MIKE BILLINGS FOR ANOTHER FOUR
dialog: YEARS! KEEP THE PAST IN OUR FUTURE!"
speaker_heading: INSIDE ANDERSON'S CHEVY
text: Through his windshield, Anderson glances at a holographic
dialog: road sign.
dialog: THE ROAD SIGN reads: "FBI Headquarters 1 mile. CIA
dialog: Headquarters 1.5 miles. PRECRIME Headquarters 2 miles."
text: Anderson goes back to his papers.
speaker_heading: INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS
text: Anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair.
text: He abruptly rises and begins to pace. The room is large,
text: but he paces like a lion confined in a cage.
text: He punches an intercom. A female VOICE responds.
speaker_heading: INTERCOM VOICE
dialog: Yes, Director Anderson?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Where's Ennis Page? Why hasn't he
dialog: delivered this morning's Precog discs?
text: Ed Witwer opens the door to the office., and casually walks
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: INTERCOM VOICE
dialog: I'll find him, sir.
text: Ed shakes his head, smiles.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Bullying the staff again, Director
dialog: Anderson?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Screw you.
text: Anderson turns away and stares out a large window. Witwer
dialog: joins him.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Was that fun for you, yesterday?
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: The Johnny Palmer bust?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: It was okay. We got our man.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 13.
text: Anderson takes a long breath.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: When do we not get our man?
dialog: They turn as Ennis PAGE, 44, a thin, tight little man with
text: burr cut hair, knocks and enters the room. He carries a
speaker_heading: black BRIEFCASE marked:
dialog: "Zone 218 - Washington/Alexandria, VA." The case is cuffed
dialog: to his wrist.
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: Sorry I'm late, sir. Precogs put
dialog: out a heavy national volume this
dialog: morning -- four for our zone.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
speaker_heading: (DISTRACTED)
dialog: Put the case on my desk, Ennis.
text: Page hesitates, doesn't do it. Anderson moves quickly to
dialog: Page.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: What was I thinking.
text: Anderson leans over the BRIEFCASE. A small panel recedes, a
text: red laser scanner clicks on, scans Anderson's eyes, BEEPS
text: affirmatively, then clicks off. The cuff on Page's wrist
dialog: falls open.
text: Now Page puts the case on Anderson's desk. Page hesitates.
dialog: Anderson and Witwer know just what he's going to do. Page
text: reaches down, unable to resist straightening a pile of papers
dialog: strewn on Anderson's desk.
text: Anderson and Witwer exchange knowing smiles. When Page looks
text: up they try to cover, but are not quick enough. He frowns
text: tightly, and heads for the door.
dialog: Anderson calls after him.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Thanks, Ennis.
text: Witwer turns to leave, too.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Now that's a guy who really cares.
text: Witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office.
text: Anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk, and opens
text: the briefcase. Four small bright DISCS sit in rows. He
text: removes one, places it in a VIDEO MONITOR that lifts into
text: view from the center of his desk. He sits back, weary, and
dialog: watches.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: VIDEO SCREEN
text: A young black woman stands in a hallway. She stares at a
text: door, gun in hand. She opens the door, enters a bedroom.
text: She glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping. She
text: lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form.
text: ANDERSON pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new
dialog: disc.
speaker_heading: VIDEO SCREEN
text: A white woman stands at a stove, cooking. A man comes up
text: behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands.
text: He raises the necktie toward her neck
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
text: He's not watching the screen. He is out of his chair now,
dialog: looking out the window.
scene_heading: INT. PRECRIME MAIN LOBBY
dialog: A tour of Precrime is in progress, like the public relations
dialog: tours run by present-day FBI. The TOUR GUIDE, a pretty,
text: smartly uniformed woman in her twenties, leads a group of
dialog: adults and children, all with glowing nametags, through the
dialog: building.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: Welcome to the main headquarters of
dialog: Precrime. Smaller Precrime branches
dialog: are scattered throughout the United
dialog: States.
text: The group follows the guide slowly through the lobby.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)
dialog: Precrime was established in 2030,
dialog: with the harnessing of the remarkable
dialog: talents of the Precognitive mutants.
text: She points cheerfully to a stubby little man, MR. HARRIS.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Harris, can you tell me how many
dialog: Precogs there are?
speaker_heading: MR. HARRIS
dialog: Three. Uh, right?
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: That's exactly right! A lot of people
dialog: assume there are Precogs in every
dialog: branch office.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)
dialog: But there are only three Precogs,
dialog: right here in this building. And
dialog: the information they give us, we
dialog: send out to all the other branches.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And what is that information -what
dialog: do the Precogs do?
text: An eager boy, TIMMY has the answer to that one.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: They protect us.
text: The guide tousles his hair.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: (chipper voice)
dialog: That's right, Timmy. Because of the
dialog: Precogs, you're going to grow up
dialog: murderfree. Isn't that something?
speaker_heading: MR. HARRIS
dialog: They ever wrong? The Precogs ever
dialog: screw up when they predict a murder?
dialog: The guide laughs tolerantly.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: Never, sir. It's an infallible
dialog: system. The Precogs predict a
dialog: homicide, and our Precrime police
dialog: then apprehend that future murderer
dialog: before the event occurs. And right
dialog: next door is the Judicial Center,
dialog: where we prosecute the
dialog: future murderers.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: Can we see the Precogs?

speaker_heading: INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER
dialog: The chamber is an elaborate, hypertech hospital, constructed
dialog: for the maintenance of three beings -- the Precogs. They
dialog: are triplets -- two of the Precogs are male, one is female.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 16.
text: Technicians swarm all over them like worker bees. The bodies
dialog: of the Precogs are being tended to: exercised, cleansed,
dialog: groomed.
text: The head of each Precog is encased in a complex, ornate HELMET
dialog: that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright
text: metallics. The helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces
dialog: seem to flow and shift, like oil on water.
text: A network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of
dialog: light, rise Medusa-like from each helmet, then centralize
text: into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe
dialog: computer.
text: The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas.
dialog: They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces.
text: Their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes
dialog: from murders only they can see. Life for a Precog is an
dialog: endless cycle of death.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON - THE FEMALE PRECOG
dialog: we recognize her fragile and perfect FACE from the opening
text: scene of the movie. She floats in a glowing nutritive bath.
dialog: Like her brothers, she seems to be eternally young, or
dialog: eternally old.
text: The technicians lift her from her bath. She is dried, dressed
text: in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair.
text: Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side
dialog: of her.
dialog: Not once are their helmets removed. What they feed into the
dialog: mainframe is too valuable. It must be gathered twenty-four
dialog: unrelenting hours a day.
speaker_heading: INT. A ROOM
text: Ennis Page sits in a room just off the Precog Chamber. He
text: can see them through a large window. He works a large
dialog: computer console, the gathering point for the information
dialog: the Precogs constantly feed the computer.
dialog: Perhaps every ten seconds, a small DISC is released by the
text: computer, and mechanically gathered, sorted, and placed -under
dialog: Page's watchful eye -- into a black case.
text: ANDERSON is in the room standing quietly behind Page. As
dialog: Director, Anderson is authorized to come and go, but from
dialog: his fussy movements, it's obvious Page sees anyone else in
dialog: the room as an intruder in his special domain.
text: Anderson turns and looks through the window at the Precogs.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: What would they think about if we
dialog: unhooked them?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 17.
text: Page looks up from his work.
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: They don't think, sir. They just
dialog: see.
dialog: Anderson is silent.
speaker_heading: PAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: They're not even alive, really.
text: Anderson contemplates the scene, nods to Page's words, then
text: turns and walks out of the room, as Page looks on.
speaker_heading: INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER
text: The female Precog sits in her chair. Her eyes are open.
text: She faces the window that looks into Page's main frame room.
text: In the window we see Anderson leaving the room.
text: The female Precog's eyes drift closed.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT.COURTROOM - JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY
text: A trial is in progress. The defendant is Johnny Palmer. He
text: sits, ashen, at a table, his DEFENSE ATTORNEY beside him.
dialog: There are no jurors in the Juror BOX. There is a JUDGE, 55,
dialog: and stern. There are a few people in the public seats.
dialog: The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson. She
text: wears a black robe, and addresses the Director of Precrime,
text: Anderson, who sits in the witness stand.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Director Anderson, do you swear that
dialog: the disc you now present to the court
dialog: is the only and authentic disc of
dialog: the future murder of Carol Palmer by
dialog: her husband, John Palmer?
dialog: It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of
text: times. Anderson gives the rote answer as he holds up the
speaker_heading: DISC.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Yes. This is the only and authentic
dialog: disc of the event seen by the
dialog: Precognitive mutants and recorded by
dialog: the Precrime Division. This is the
dialog: immutable evidence of the infallible
dialog: system.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: The murder of Carol Palmer will occur
dialog: ... ?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at
dialog: 10:33 in the morning.
text: Lisa steps back. The judge reaches out and Anderson hands
text: him the disc. The judge inserts it into a special video
text: machine on his desk. Anderson steps down, his ritual part
dialog: in this trial completed.
text: A huge MONITOR comes to life behind the judge. He does not
dialog: turn around to watch -- he has his own monitor.
text: Johnny Palmer watches, eyes wide. We now see, in detail,
dialog: what we previously heard the Precogs act out in the beginning
dialog: of the movie.
speaker_heading: THE MONITOR
text: The Palmer's family room. Johnny reaches into Carol's sewing
text: basket for the scissors. Carol stands defenseless in front
text: of him. Their son cowers in a corner of the room.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Johnny, please --
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: "Johnny, please. Johnny please."
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You're scaring me.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY'S SON
speaker_heading: DADDY, DON'T. DADDY
text: Johnny approaches his wife with deadly menace.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (considering)
dialog: I don't like you any more, Carol.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (imploring)
dialog: Put the scissors down. You're scaring
dialog: me. Please.
text: We cut away from the monitor and stay on JOHNNY PALMER'S FACE
text: as he sits at the defense table. He winces at each terrible exchange.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, Carol.
speaker_heading: CAROL (O.S.)
dialog: Johnny! Stop!
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (O.S.)
dialog: Don't grab at me! Let go...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY'S SON (O.S.)
dialog: Daddy! No!
text: Johnny Palmer cries out as the MONITOR goes blank.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I didn't do it. I'm innocent! It
dialog: didn't happen!
text: The JUDGE hits his gavel.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: How does the defense plead?
text: The defense attorney glances at his watch, then quickly
dialog: rattles off the words to his part of this judicial ritual.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE ATTORNEY
dialog: The defense acknowledges the
dialog: infallibility of the system. We are
dialog: Guilty. We throw ourselves at the
dialog: mercy of the court.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: No! No! The Precogs are wrong! No!
text: The court guards are on him in an instant. They lead him
dialog: out of the courtroom.
scene_heading: INT.A BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY
text: Anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and
text: enters a disheveled room. The fifties interior is drab: a
text: Formica table, bad curtains, a frayed Lazy Boy positioned in
dialog: front of a TV.
text: Ed Witwer is already on the scene. He stands a few feet
text: from the BODY of a man, gunshot wound to the head, a handgun
dialog: on the floor nearby.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: (to Anderson)
dialog: Looks like the old days.
text: Anderson nods to his former partner. Anderson leans over
dialog: the body.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: That would be bad news for an
dialog: infallible system.
text: Witwer is suddenly bored.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: We know it can't be a murder -- the
dialog: Precogs would've seen it. Why do
dialog: you insist on coming to these things?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Keeps the system honest. And besides,
dialog: I like to pretend I'm a cop.
dialog: Anderson turns to an officer.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's got the Coroner?
text: Another OFFICER steps forward with a large blue case.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Right here, sir.
text: The officer places the case beside the corpse, and opens the
text: latches. Inside the case is a large metallic APPARATUS: the
dialog: "Coroner."
text: It comes to auto-life, and begins to unfold itself - It rises
text: crab-like, and steps out of its case.
text: Except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move. His projected
text: image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his
dialog: back. He is the interface, the way the humans communicate
dialog: with the crab apparatus.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Hi DOC.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
dialog: Hello, Director Anderson.
text: The coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down
text: on the floor. It moves slowly, hesitating as it crawls the
dialog: body's back to insert various razor thin probes and core
text: samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: This a homicide, Doc?
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
dialog: I'm presently analyzing neurohormones,
dialog: Assistant Director Witwer. I have
dialog: not concluded my examination.
text: The crab engulfs the back of the head, probes the wound.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm detecting carbonization of skull
dialog: fragments around the entry wound.
dialog: Witwer whispers to Anderson.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Bingo. The guy put the gun to his
dialog: own head.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
dialog: I have not determined that yet,
dialog: Assistant Director.
dialog: Witwer grins.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: You have good ears for a ghost, Doc.
text: The coroner crab steps away from the body.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
dialog: Please rotate the corpse to the
dialog: lateral supine position.
text: Two officers turn the body face-up. The crab inches close
text: to probe the face. Disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids,
dialog: and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment
dialog: the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive.
text: Then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs At last, it
text: comes to a standstill. The holographic Doctor closes his
dialog: eyes as if in thought.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Can you imagine if this was a
dialog: homicide? Who even knows how to
dialog: hunt down a killer any more?
text: Anderson gives him a hard look.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I know how, dammit. You know how.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Easy, partner.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But you know what I'm saying. The
dialog: state legislatures are pushing to
dialog: stop funding for training homicide
dialog: detectives ...
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: God bless the Precogs.
text: The Doctor opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
dialog: This event is a negative homicide.
dialog: A mortal wound was generated by a
dialog: .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to
dialog: the parietal 'portion of the skull
dialog: on June 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm,
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Eastern Standard Time. This event
dialog: is a positive suicide.
text: The holographic doctor begins to shimmer, then disappears
text: back into the coroner crab. The crab crawls back into its
text: case, folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body, and
dialog: shuts down.
dialog: Witwer turns to Anderson.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: It's time to stop coming to these,
dialog: partner.
text: Anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a
dialog: stretcher.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Yeah. You're right.
scene_heading: INT. A BANQUET - WASHINGTON, D.C. -- NIGHT
text: Anderson, in black-tie, with Lisa in a shimmering blue gown
text: at his side, moves through a huge room filled high level
dialog: government officials and politicians.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: A little bit of me dies every time I
dialog: come to one of these things.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: It's only a party, Paul.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I'd never have let them appoint me
dialog: to Precrime if I'd have known this
dialog: was going to be part of it.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You're exactly what Precrime needed.
dialog: An amazing homicide cop and a real
dialog: person in an unreal job.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: 
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: The public loves the
dialog: Precogs. But they give people the
dialog: creeps, too. You're something they
dialog: understandp a regular cop running
dialog: things.
text: Anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed
dialog: banquet hall.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Let's invite all these irregular
dialog: assholes over for a barbecue. Burgers
dialog: and beer - think they'd come?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 23.
text: A barrel-chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair,
text: SENATOR MALCOLM, 58, takes hold of Anderson's elbow from
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: I'd come, Mr. Director. And I'd
dialog: make all the other assholes come
dialog: with me.
text: Lisa reddens, Anderson gives an embarrassed cough. The
text: Senator laughs and claps him on the back.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice job this morning. Another
dialog: negative homicide. The Precogs never
dialog: let us down.
text: Mrs. Malcolm smoothly occupies Lisa, while the Senator eases
dialog: Anderson in the opposite direction
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: I have a dream, Paul.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I know you do, Senator.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: Hundreds of Precogs. Not just
dialog: predicting murders, but predicting
dialog: all crimes. Burglary, arson, assaults
dialog: ...
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: How about jaywalking? Littering?
dialog: Now there's a crime.
text: The Senator smiles through his teeth.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: I don't want a police state, you
dialog: know that. But we have an opportunity
dialog: here, and
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: No sir, we don't have that
dialog: opportunity. There are only three
dialog: Precogs. They're a lucky accident
dialog: of nature. There are no more.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We can make more. Just give me your
dialog: support. Help me increase funding
dialog: for the Precog Engineering Project.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Precogs aren't sheep or pigs. Seeing

speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: There was only one Mozart, and there

speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: Fuck Mozart. The people want to be
dialog: safe. They want that more than they
dialog: want food or love.
text: He gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at us -it's 2040 and we've
dialog: wrapped ourselves up in the 1950's
dialog: like a big security blanket. Why?
dialog: Because we want to feel like they
dialog: felt. Safe.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Senator, a world filled with hundreds
dialog: of Precogs is not my idea of a safe
dialog: place.
dialog: The Senator gives it one last shot.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: Sure could use your help, Paul.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I decline, Senator. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: (icily)

dialog: sea of black-ties and exquisite fifties dresses.
scene_heading: INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD DAY
text: Anderson walks through the lab with a tall, pale man, DR,
dialog: RESFIELD, 60, the head scientist. It is not a place that
dialog: warms Anderson's heart.
dialog: Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting
dialog: and examining protoplasmic tissue masses. Other technicians
dialog: peer through massive microscopes. Still others use robotic
dialog: arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded-glass
dialog: barriers.
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD
dialog: You don't get out here much.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Not my sort of place.
text: Dr. Resfield emits a dry little laugh.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD
dialog: The head of Precrime squeamish?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: When it comes to needles and scalpels,
dialog: yeah.
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD
dialog: I promise we won't use any on you.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: What do you use them on?
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD
dialog: (beat)
dialog: On bits of this and that.
text: Anderson looks at him. The doctor pauses outside a thick
text: door. An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes, and
text: the door opens with an electronic hiss.
text: Anderson looks around the lab. Technicians lower mesh
dialog: cylinders into some sort of chemical VAT. Another technician
text: turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the
dialog: roiling liquid.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: What's happening here?
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD
dialog: We're in an interesting phase.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: What's in the cylinders?
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD
dialog: Neurotissue.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: From ...?
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD
dialog: A fusion of sources. From the
dialog: Precogs' deceased mother. From the
dialog: Precogs themselves.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: A fusion of ... ?
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD
dialog: In lay terms, we mated sperm from
dialog: the brothers with ova from the mother
dialog: and sister to create new growth.
text: The CYLINDERS shudder as the voltage is increased.
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD (CONT'D)
dialog: And then we add mutating variables.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dialog: expression he has already learned enough.
scene_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- DAY
dialog: Anderson sits in his office reviewing Precog discs for
dialog: premurders in the local Washington area. We stay on him as he
text: watches the monitor. He pops the disc, jots down some notes,

scene_heading: EXT. FRANK D'IGNAZIO'S BACKYARD -- LATER
text: Frank is on his hands and knees, working his vegetable garden.
text: He whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich

text: He sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate. He
text: lifts his straw hat in greeting, gives a smile. It's
speaker_heading: ANDERSON.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: What are you doing, playing hooky?
text: Anderson tries to smile. But it won't come. He looks around
dialog: the abundant garden.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: It's great out here, Frank.. You got
dialog: the touch.
text: Frank straightens with a grimace.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: I got the arthritis, is what I got.
text: Anderson reflexively looks up at a high WHINING sound from
text: over head. Frank follows his gaze. A Precrime HOVERCRAFT
text: glides into position overhead.
text: Frank stares, then lowers his eyes to the ground. He takes
dialog: a long sad breath.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah shit, neighbor.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Goddamn Precogs don't miss a beat,

scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: I thought I'd buried it all.
dialog: Thirty-five years -- all those minutes

text: Frank stops pacing. He stares at a kitchen drawer.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: He'd served his time, Frank. I know
dialog: it's not fair. It's way beyond not
dialog: fair ...
text: Frank looks. At Anderson bitterly.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: (yells)
dialog: God damn the Precogs. You know?
dialog: Why couldn't they have been around
dialog: to save my girl?
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Now they're catching me.
text: Frank reaches into the drawer and pulls out a small handgun.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)
dialog: I really shoot the bastard, huh?
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Next Wednesday, at noon.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: Good.
text: Anderson's cop eyes are all over the gun.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: It's not in you, Frank, to kill
dialog: anybody.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGRAZIO
dialog: Tell it to the Precogs. It's set in
dialog: stone now, right?
text: Frank puts the gun on the kitchen counter. Anderson relaxes.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: (almost inaudible)
dialog: I don't want to be a part of this
dialog: world anymore.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I know, Frank.
dialog: Frank gives Anderson a look -- no, friend, you don't know.
text: Then Frank looks hard at the gun on the counter.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So. Tell me, Paul. Do the Precogs
dialog: see everything?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRANK D'IGRAZIO
dialog: Then they won't have seen this.
text: Frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own
text: head. On Anderson's anguished FACE, at the SOUND of the gun
dialog: going off.
scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD -- LATER
text: Anderson stands with his old partner, Witwer, on Frank's
text: front porch. Behind them, through an open door, we see Lisa
dialog: comforting Ellie D'Ignazio in the living room.
text: Anderson is deeply shaken. Witwer tries to talk him through
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: WITWER
speaker_heading: (GENTLY)
dialog: We had to bring him in.
dialog: Anderson doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: He was a future murderer.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: You blame him? The guy killed his

speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. I know. I know.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 29.
text: Anderson turns and watches as they wheel Frank's draped body
text: into the back of an ambulance. Anderson's bitterness erupts.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in
dialog: them absolutely and I hate them
dialog: absolutely. Jesus.
dialog: Witwer listens to him.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: And that goddamn lab trying to grow
dialog: more of them. Put a Precog in every
dialog: home, you know? So we can have more
dialog: Franks - people shooting themselves --
dialog: over who knows what?
text: Witwer kneads Anderson's shoulder, talks to him in soothing
dialog: tones like you'd calm an agitated horse.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Precrime did the job it was supposed
dialog: to do.
text: The two men can hear Ellie sobbing inside the house.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: You know it. And you believe in it.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (BEAT)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: It's not easy. It beats us down.
dialog: Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates
dialog: you right now.
dialog: Anderson turns to Witwer.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: That's why I got into this business
dialog: -- to be hated.
text: Anderson almost manages a small smile. Witwer puts his arm
text: around him. Walks him away from the scene.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: They hated us when we were regular
dialog: cops. Now we're Precrime, and they
dialog: still hate US. It's one of the little
dialog: perks of law enforcement nobody knows

text: ANDERSON looks up, wearily.
scene_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- LATER
text: Anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor, almost
dialog: absently. As we have seen him do before, he swivels his

dialog: the sky above the Washington Monument.
text: The camera stays on Anderson's back as the sound from the

speaker_heading: ANDERSON (O.S.)
dialog: Let's not do this, Ed.
text: Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and

speaker_heading: THE MONITOR

text: slumps, dying, beneath the huge digital clock, which reads:
dialog: 5:20 AM.
speaker_heading: BACK TO SCENE
text: Anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank. His hand
text: goes to his mouth. His body begins to shake. He hugs
dialog: himself, but he can't stop the shaking.
text: The DISC pops out of the side of the monitor. It is a small
text: SOUND, but it has Anderson up and out of his chair as if it
text: were a gunshot, He reaches for the disc but cannot touch it.
text: His legs suddenly weaken, and he drops to one knee beside
text: his desk, like a man in need of prayer.
text: There is a single thought that screams through his brain.
text: It is an almost visible thing, filling the room, blackly.
text: Anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I kill you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh god, I kill you.
text: As Anderson pulls himself up, and tries to reach again for
dialog: the disc ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER
text: In an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie,
text: the three FACES of the Precogs hover in the misty darkness.
text: Their closed eyes open in SUDDEN UNISON. They speak as one.
speaker_heading: ALL THREE
dialog: Murderer!
text: After a long moment, the eyes close again, and the Precogs
dialog: fade into the mists ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE
text: Anderson looks up sharply at the SOUND of a knock on his
text: door. Every normal sound seems grotesquely AMPLIFIED, the
dialog: traffic outside, his own breathing.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 32.
dialog: His senses are on overload.
text: The door begins to open. A stockinged leg is the first thing
dialog: Anderson sees. His secretary, ANGELA.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Sir?
text: She hesitates before fully entering the room, Anderson grabs
text: at the incriminating disc. He sees his EYES reflected in
text: its alloy surface. He pushes the disc deep into his pants
dialog: pocket.
text: Somehow he finds his voice.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Come in. Angela.
text: She looks at him, uncertain. Then she places a small stack
dialog: of papers on his desk.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Need you to sign these. And your
dialog: eleven o'clock starts in five minutes.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: My ... eleven.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Budget coordination with the FBI.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You okay, sir?
text: Anderson runs his hand through his hair, can't think fast
text: enough. He sees her glance at the black Precog disc case.
text: He shuts it, awkwardly, and it auto-locks.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Have Page take this.
text: Angela steps back, disturbed.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: But sir, the procedure
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (SNAPS)
dialog: I make procedure. Call him.
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: I'm not okay, Angela ... you're right.
dialog: My head and stomach. I'm going down to the clinic. Or maybe
dialog: just home.
text: Angela looks relieved at the explanation.
speaker_heading: ANGELA
dialog: Yes sir.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 33.
text: He moves past her. His FINGERS fidget against the hidden
dialog: disc in his pocket.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I'll speak to Witwer, put him in
dialog: charge for the rest of the day.
text: He hesitates at the door, turns to look at his office, and
text: at his view of Washington. Then he is gone.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE WITWER'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Anderson looks in the door Of Witwer's empty office. He
dialog: takes a step inside.
text: Witwer's booming voice sounds from behind him, startling
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Breaking and entering. That'll get
dialog: you five to ten, hard.
text: Witwer immediately scans his old partner's ashen face.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
text: Anderson can hardly bear to meet his friend's eyes. He
text: REACHES into his pocket, as if to lift the disc into the
dialog: light. If he could just do that, show it to Witwer.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Paul?
text: Anderson's hand comes out of his pocket, EMPTY.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Take over for me today?
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: You sick?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Yeah.
text: Witwer makes a show of backing away.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Don't give it to me. You probably
dialog: have that Trans-10 virus going around.
dialog: A stomach thing. I hate stomach
dialog: things.
dialog: Anderson Almost smiles.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Ed.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Yeah?
text: Witwer looks at him. Anderson almost reaches out for him.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Run the place, okay?
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Sure. Right into the ground.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Go on home before I call Infectious
dialog: Control and have them spray you down
dialog: with something.
text: Anderson moves unsteadily down the hallway. Witwer calls
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: You want me to do the discs, or hold
dialog: them for you to review when you get
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Can't let them back up. Do 'em.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Call you later. Take it easy, all
dialog: right?
text: Witwer lifts his hand in farewell, Anderson fixes on that
dialog: last image -- Witwer waving goodbye.
scene_heading: INT. PRECRIME UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- LATER
text: Anderson, sweating now, leans against a thick cement pillar
text: and pulls out a cell phone. He hits a button.
scene_heading: INTERCUT BETWEEN ANDERSON / LISA AT THE JUDICIAL CENTER
text: Lisa sits in a meeting. Her phone CHIRPS softly. She glances
text: at the display, then rises to take it. She goes to a corner
dialog: of the room.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Paul?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Listen to me.
text: Lisa presses her phone close to her ear.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I can hardly hear you.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I'm underground. Weakens the signal
dialog: so it can't be picked up.
text: Alarm moves across her face.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: But we're on Secure
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Listen, dammit! I'm going to murder
dialog: Ed.
dialog: The Precogs picked it up.
dialog: On Lisa -- can she have heard right?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Paul. Paul His crackling voice
text: faintly comes through the phone.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON'S VOICE
dialog: ... home.
text: Lisa's phone goes dead.
speaker_heading: BACK TO ANDERSON
text: Anderson looks down a long row of parked Precrime ground
dialog: transports. They are sleek and menacing, the black shells
text: lumpy with dangerous gadgetry. In the distance, a POLICE
text: OFFICER, holding an armful of equipment, opens the back of
dialog: one of them.
text: He looks up at Anderson's approach. He puts his equipment
dialog: down, and salutes.
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Hello, sir.
dialog: Anderson nods, moves close.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: What's your name, officer?
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Bob, uh, Robert Smythe.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: These the new Python transports?
text: The young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride,
text: is about to speak, when Anderson touches a palm-sized Nova
text: stun gun to the base of his neck.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: (sincerely)
dialog: Sorry, Officer Smythe.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 36.
text: The officer buckles. Anderson catches him, rolls him gently
dialog: into the back of the transport.
text: Then Anderson quickly reaches into the transport, and begins
text: stuffing equipment into a duffel bag: a helmet and black
text: uniform, the weapon-glove, a folded rifle, a holographic
dialog: scanner, and other equipment whose function we can only guess
dialog: at.
text: Anderson looks up at a sound, echoey FOOTSTEPS. They
dialog: approach, then fade away.
text: Anderson places the officer's hands and legs together, then
text: aims a nozzled cylinder at them. He shoots a spray of blue
dialog: BindFoam chemical restraint, sticking the man to the floor
dialog: of the transport in an adhesive glob.
text: Then he leaves the scene, running.
speaker_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S CHEVY
text: Anderson grips the wheel of his Chevy, driving down 1-95.
dialog: The fact that he can't control his car -- that the steering
dialog: wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his
text: direction is guided by satellite -- is maddening now.
text: From inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn
text: and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his
dialog: steering wheel.
text: Anderson slams it with his fist. Through his windshield
text: Anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a
text: passing red and black Ford. His mother sits in the
text: passenger's seat, blithely reading. The boy mimics Anderson,
text: gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs.
text: Anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance,
dialog: at the "Sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to Washington
dialog: D.C. You can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: EXT. POTOMAC PARK
text: Anderson stands on an embankment. He holds the Precog disc
text: in his hand, ready to throw it into the river.
text: He stands like that ... and then slowly lets his hand drop.
dialog: He doesn't do it.
scene_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S HOME - SUBURBS -- LATER
text: Lisa enters the house, in a rush. Every shade is drawn.
text: Paul Anderson sits in an overstuffed chair, absolutely
text: motionless, like a man who has died suddenly.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Don't move.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 37.
text: Lisa doesn't get it. She continues toward him.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop! Moving heats you up, makes it
dialog: easier for them to pick you up on
dialog: their thermals.
text: She looks at him, scared, stops in her tracks. She is
dialog: suddenly suffocating.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: It's a hundred degrees in here.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I turned the furnace all the way up.
dialog: Your hair dryer. The oven. If they
dialog: come, it'll buy me twenty seconds.
dialog: Maybe thirty.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Nobody's coming for you.
text: Anderson stares at her.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: On the phone -- what you said. It's
dialog: impossible.
text: She shakes her head in disbelief. Anderson speaks, choking
dialog: on the words.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: It's not true.
text: Anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair.
text: We see the bright DISC cupped in the palm. He seems about
text: to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet. He keeps staring at
text: her intently. Something is holding him back.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're upset. You've been unhappy.
dialog: There's a lot of pressure on you.
dialog: And then Frank ...
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: One week from today. Tuesday, June
dialog: 25, at five-twenty in the morning.
dialog: I shoot him, Lisa.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You need to take time off.
dialog: Anderson laughs harshly.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: You don't have to worry about that.
text: She steps toward him.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (gently)
dialog: I want to hold you.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: If you love me, stand there. And
dialog: don't move.
text: Tears well in her eyes.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I saw the disc, Lisa. I shoot him.
dialog: In the chest. And he dies. I've
dialog: watched a thousand murders. This
dialog: time I star in one.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Something's wrong. You wouldn't do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: The Precogs are never wrong. They
dialog: emit a single disc. "The immutable
dialog: evidence of the infallible system."
text: The room is terribly hot, his words -- she begins to sway
dialog: unsteadily.
text: Anderson focuses on her. Her face. Her hair ...
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: We'll figure this out. We'll review
dialog: the system.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: There is no review. There's only
dialog: the disc. It Shows My guilt. There's
dialog: no defense.
text: Her long hair. He stares.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You can't run. Please, let's --
text: A SOUND outside. They both turn. A deep silence. The
text: furnace churns out heat. And Anderson looks at Lisa's hair
dialog: ... and finally understands.
text: Slowly, and very carefully, Anderson slides the DISC back
text: into his pocket. He rises from his chair. For the first
text: time he goes to her, reaches out, and touches her hair.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Last week. It was strange. I watched
dialog: from the bathroom window. You went
text: out in the backyard to make a call.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: An appointment, you said. For a
dialog: haircut that afternoon.
text: Lisa's hand jumps to her hair.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't get your hair cut. You
dialog: went to the trouble of calling first
dialog: thing in the morning. It was that
dialog: important ...
text: She reaches for him. He pulls away.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Stop it! Paul, please. You're
dialog: panicking. Everything's going to
dialog: look wrong. You're going to distrust
dialog: everybody and everything now.
text: Lisa implores him.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't distrust me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It was Ed I called.
text: Anderson cocks his head.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Ed. why outside? Why lie about it?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Stop being a cop and listen to me!
text: A booming, electronically altered VOICE suddenly penetrates
dialog: the walls of the house from outside.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Director Anderson! There is no
dialog: escape!
text: Anderson, betrayed, glares at his wife. She's frantic.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Your birthday's tomorrow! We wanted
dialog: to...
text: But be's already on the move, running for the upstairs.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Drop to your hands and knees and
dialog: stay there. Precrime is entering
dialog: your house!
text: Lisa screams, as her front door is sonically BLASTED off its
text: hinges, and a swarm of Precrime officers in mirrored helmets
dialog: hurtle in.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Paul!
text: They move past her and spread through the rooms and up the
dialog: stairs like a disease in fast motion.
speaker_heading: UPSTAIRS
dialog: Helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out,
dialog: scanning rooms for thermal presence.
text: An OFFICER 1 steps out of a small room. He speaks, his voice
dialog: electronically altered.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1
dialog: He's got a hair dryer going. Screwed
dialog: up my reading.
dialog: The others nod.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 2
dialog: We're not picking up shit.
text: They rush into rooms, with increased urgency. We follow
text: OFFICER 1 as he moves counter to the group and down the
dialog: stairs.
text: He hesitates as he moves through the living room, which is
text: awash in personnel. Lisa stands against the wall, pale and
text: shaken. He looks at her for a long beat, then steps over
text: the shattered door and out into the sunlight.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: Everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm.
dialog: But Anderson's house looks like a wasps's nest someone has
text: kicked. Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it,
dialog: engines WHINING. Black Python transports are all over the
text: street out in front, and more keep coming.
dialog: And everywhere on foot, there are Precrime police. OFFICER
dialog: I approaches a Python ground transport. Another officer
text: guards it, weapon out, his head turning right to left. He
text: settles on OFFICER 1's approach and raises his weapon.
text: OFFICER 1 doesn't even break stride. He walks right up to
text: the guard -- and then right through him. A holograph decoy.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1 enters the Python.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE PYTHON
dialog: OFFICER 1 removes his helmet -- it's Anderson. And then
dialog: comes the moment of truth -- have they cancelled his
dialog: IdentiScan access to Precrime vehicles yet?
text: A little scanner arm arches down from the visor, and flashes
text: a red beam into his eyes. Anderson presses his lips together.
text: The Python turns on, and a generated voice greets him.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Paul Anderson 0256 clear.
text: Anderson grips the steering wheel. But his time, since it
dialog: is a law enforcement. Vehicle, the steering actually works.
dialog: Anderson pulls out.
text: FROM ABOVE, as the Python transport slips away from the chaos.
dialog: THEN HIGHER, and we see that the direction the Python is
dialog: headed will take it from the green of the suburbs, through
dialog: the white of Washington, and into the dark of The Sprawl.
scene_heading: INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY
text: Ed Witwer sits alone in an antechamber. He stares at an
text: oversized oak door, then looks down at the floor.
text: He runs both hands through his hair. He is tired, his eyes
dialog: weary, lost.
text: A voice comes over the intercom.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Enter now please, Assistant Director
dialog: Witwer.
text: Witwer pulls himself together, and opens the door.
speaker_heading: INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM
text: Witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table.
text: Powerful men sit at the other end of the table. SWANSON,
text: sharp-boned, the FBI Director. CRONIN, awl-like eyes, the
dialog: CIA Director. Senator Malcolm. Chief Justice POLLARD, whose
text: face reveals nothing. Vice-President ALMER, whose tongue
text: darts across his dry lips unsettlingly. Unpleasant looking
dialog: men in an unpleasant mood.
text: Cronin looks up from a printout he's been reading and stares
dialog: at Witwer.
speaker_heading: CIA CRONIN
dialog: The central question is: Why does
dialog: Anderson want to kill Witwer?
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 42.
text: Cronin holds up the printout.
speaker_heading: CIA CRONIN (CONT'D)
dialog: We checked your finances. His
dialog: finances. Nothing irregular, you
dialog: don't steal from him, he doesn't
dialog: steal from you. You haven't done
dialog: anything that he might have
dialog: discovered, and vice versa.
text: Swanson holds up another sheath of papers.
speaker_heading: FBI SWANSON
dialog: Personnel checks reveal no ambitious
dialog: coups planned by you to topple him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's done nothing to you, or you to
dialog: him.
text: Witwer presses his lips together.
speaker_heading: VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER
dialog: You fucking his wife?
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FBI SWANSON
speaker_heading: HIS MOTHER? HIS BROTHER?
text: Witwer gives him a bad look.
speaker_heading: FBI SWANSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. There we are.
speaker_heading: JUSTICE POLLARD
dialog: So, you are friends, partners, and
dialog: soul mates. Anderson has no motive.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: I can't think of one.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs
dialog: are mistaken?
dialog: Witwer looks away. Jesus, he wants out of this room.
speaker_heading: JUSTICE POLLARD
dialog: You don't believe that, do you?
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: No. The Precogs are infallible.
dialog: Senator Malcolm is impatient with all this.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: You're goddam right. So, gentlemen
dialog: -screw the motive. We got a
dialog: pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty
dialog: little PR problem.
text: The very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on Witwer.
speaker_heading: VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER
dialog: And here is our solution. You are
dialog: now Director Witwer.
text: Witwer shakes his head, starts to protest. Almer silences
text: him with a raised finger.
speaker_heading: VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER (CONT'D)
dialog: Precrime must demonstrate its
dialog: willingness to go after one of its
dialog: own. Total impartiality.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Now look--
dialog: Cronin talks right over him.
speaker_heading: CIA CRONIN
dialog: The public must believe that every
dialog: future murderer is pursued with equal
dialog: vigor.
speaker_heading: FBI SWANSON
dialog: Therefore, Precrime will put in charge
dialog: the man best suited to the job. And
dialog: who would pursue a murderer harder
dialog: ... than his intended victim?
speaker_heading: JUSTICE POLLARD
dialog: You went after Anderson yesterday
dialog: -because it was right, and because
dialog: you believe.
text: Almer speaks with a tight irony.
speaker_heading: VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER
dialog: And your belief will certainly grow
dialog: stronger with each tick of the clock.
text: Witwer looks at the men with thinly-veiled hatred. But he
dialog: does not deny their words.
speaker_heading: JUSTICE POLLARD
dialog: Haw long will it take, Director?
text: Wiltwer takes a long breath, concentrates his mind on the
dialog: task he can't avoid.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: He knows Precrime, of course. And
dialog: the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll
dialog: remember how to work them. It'll
dialog: come back to him fast. He's ... the
dialog: best.
text: Witwer almost smiles. Justice Pollard's not smiling.
speaker_heading: JUSTICE POLLARD
dialog: We're not here to praise Caesar --
dialog: we're here to bury him.
text: Witwer looks at Pollard, then lifts a finger and touches his
dialog: right eye.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: He can't avoid iris identification.
dialog: Every door he opens, every ATM he
dialog: uses, or taxi or transport he boards
dialog: -- he'll get scanned.
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It won't take long to find him.
text: The eyes that look back at Witwer are unblinking.
speaker_heading: EXT. THE SPRAWL NIGHT
dialog: The unzoned city is full of 1950's iconography, but it all
dialog: feels different than it did in the suburbs. Where the burbs
dialog: were Ike, the city is Joseph McCarthy.
dialog: The fat Ramblers and Studebakers have a little grime on them.
dialog: The women's dresses are tighter and more urgent, the men's
dialog: suits have some shine at the elbows. You look over your
dialog: shoulder here, move faster, and smile a lot less.
dialog: And some streets you don't go on at all. Anderson's Python
text: moves down one of them. He stops under a blackened suspension
text: bridge, gets out. He's still in uniform. He holds a duffel
dialog: bag.
text: He starts to walk away from the Python, then hesitates.
text: He's left the door open. He shakes his head at his
text: sloppiness. Goes back and shuts the door. Walks away again.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
text: He's left a small DEVICE on the passenger's seat. Digital
text: numbers shoot by in reverse. Something CLICKS.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE THE CAR
text: Anderson continues walking away. He doesn't look back as
text: the Python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame.
dialog: It's not a gasoline powered vehicle -- so it doesn't explode.
dialog: It just ceases to exist.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS - -- NIGHT LATER
text: Through a smeared window Anderson sees racks of suits and
text: dresses hanging in clear plastic bags. He gets to work on
dialog: the door.
scene_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Lisa lies in her bed, alone in the dark. She listens to an
text: almost inaudible sound, a high WHINE.
speaker_heading: EXT. ANDERSON'S HOUSE
text: A Precrime HOVERCRAFT floats high above her house, a dark
dialog: moon in the low clouds.
scene_heading: EXT. ORANGE DRY CLEANERS -- EARLY MORNING
text: A worker stands in the back of the store puzzling over the
text: clean clothes piled on the floor. It almost looks like a
dialog: nest, like someone slept there
speaker_heading: EXT. SUBWAY LATER
text: Anderson, in a blue suit and fedora, carrying his duffel
text: bag, stands on a subway platform. He takes out a cell phone,
text: dials a number. He looks up at the SOUND of a train.
text: The approaching MagLev train has a lit sign on its front
dialog: car: "33rd Street Express."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS
text: Search and Command room. Witwer moves up and down the aisles,
dialog: past technicians who man computers and holographic tracking
dialog: displays.
text: A Precrime TECHNICIAN 1 suddenly sits upright. Witwer picks
text: him out of the crowd and zeroes in.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: It's Anderson.
text: Witwer grabs a phone, punches a button
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Paul!
dialog: 
text: The technicians scramble to pinpoint Anderson on a

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: EXT. SUBWAY STATION
text: Anderson, holding his phone, is IdentiScanned along with

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS
text: Another TECHNICIAN 2 calls out to Witwer. Witwer covers his

speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN 2
dialog: He's been Scanned. He's on the 33rd
dialog: Street Subway!
text: TECHNICIAN 1 Calls from the other side of the room
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN

dialog: We got him on the Subway, too!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: WITWER

dialog: It was going to be today.

speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell
dialog: of a surprise, though.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm having trouble trusting people,
dialog: Ed, I gotta tell you.
text: At Precrime, they upload a MAP DISPLAY of the Express train's
dialog: route. We see a blue light moving -- the train. And two
dialog: separate red dots along its route.
text: An OFFICER points at the dots, and speaks to Witwer in a low
dialog: voice.

speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Didn't think so. But it has to be
dialog: something, Ed.
text: Witwer looks at the DISPLAY MAP. We see the blue train

dialog: lighted green dots -- Precrime units heading for 20th and
dialog: 33rd.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Paul. Come in.
text: Anderson sees an overhead light come on in the train: "Next
dialog: Stop 20th Street.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: If I come in, it puts me close to
dialog: you. If I get close ... I may kill
dialog: you. I can't risk that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Anyway, they'd force you to lock me
dialog: up. And that'd be it -- I'd never

dialog: Witwer needs to keep him talking
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: You're kinds liking this, in a way,

dialog: -- he's going on to 33rd Street, the last stop.
text: Technician 2 presses his earphone close, listens, then calls
text: over to Witwer. Witwer covers his mouthpiece.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN 2
dialog: We have visual verification -- he's
dialog: still on the train.
dialog: Witwer gives him a thumb's up. We STAY ON Witwer as he
text: listens to Anderson, and watches his train move toward 33rd
speaker_heading: on the MAP.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON'S VOICE
dialog: I want to tell you something, partner.
dialog: You listening?
dialog: Witwer nods. Now the MAP shows all the Precrime units

speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON'S VOICE
dialog: I gotta do this. I have to figure

text: He looks urgently to the phone technician
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN 1
text: He's still on the line.
text: Witwer presses his ear to the phone. He can hear the subway

dialog: -the voices of the Precrime police, the SCREAMS of panicked

speaker_heading: VOICES ON ANDERSON'S PHONE
dialog: Police. Everyone down on your hands

text: Anderson begins to shimmer, then dematerialize ghost-like,
dialog: into nothingness. He was a holographic decoy.
text: What is actually there on the train seat is Anderson's cell
text: phone. Rigged to its mouthpiece is a tiny digital voice
dialog: recorder.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. 20TH STREET SUBWAY
text: Anderson trots up the stairs and safely out onto the streets
dialog: of The Sprawl.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT
dialog: Every city has its underbelly. If you lifted the fat dark
dialog: underbelly of The Sprawl this is where you'd end up.
text: The streets here feel like alleys, clotted and tight. There
dialog: are streetlights, bright ones -- but the light dies at its
dialog: source, never makes it through the sour air down to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: The retro fifties look comes apart here. The people that
dialog: you see -- and you only catch quick glimpses of them, they
dialog: move like rats -- wear black mostly, tight fitting
dialog: tech-fibers.
text: ANDERSON'S caught one of the rats, a thin bald guy in black.
text: Anderson has him pinned up against a wall. They're having
dialog: some kind of exchange -- which consists of the guy answering
dialog: none of Anderson's questions, and Anderson pressing him harder
dialog: against the wall.
text: Finally, the guy does something odd. He lifts a finger and
text: pulls down Anderson's right lower eyelid. Anderson lets
text: him. Then the guy does the same on the left. Has a long
text: look. And then nods. Anderson releases him, and they go
dialog: off together.
scene_heading: EXT. AN APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER
text: An oppressive brick thing on a side street. The facade is
dialog: crumbling. Nothing good happens in a building like this..
text: The guy leads Anderson to the building, then scurries off
dialog: into the night.
speaker_heading: INT. ROOM -- LATER
text: A stained overstuffed chair in the corner, a dreary little
text: kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink.
dialog: But jarringly, in the center of all this, is a make-shift
text: hypertech medical setup: a gleaming operating table, an array
dialog: of lasers, scalpels and surgical equipment, an anesthesia
dialog: console.
text: Anderson sits in a chair facing DOC. DOC is a big man with
text: delicate fingers. He sneezes, then blows his nose hard into
dialog: a handkerchief.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Got a cold.
text: Anderson looks at him uneasily. It's not just DOC -- it's
dialog: the whole setup, the needles and scalpels, the medical thing,
dialog: which Anderson truly does not care for. Doc sneezes again,
text: then looks up at his patient.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry. I could cut open your
dialog: chest, sew a dead cat in there, and
dialog: you'd never get an infection. Not
dialog: with the spectrum antibios I'll be
dialog: shooting into you.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc.
text: Doc chuckles. Then he waits, expectantly.
text: Anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card. A preset cash
text: card. DOC slides it into small console, watches the numbers
text: flash up. He frowns, sighs.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: It's all I could safely move
text: He waits. Doc's not thrilled, but finally, he nods.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Yeah. All right.
text: Time to got down to business. Doc walks over to a large
text: medical cabinet and opens the door. It's full of EYES, and
dialog: parts of eyes -- 611 ! A cryo-jars.
dialog: Anderson tightens.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: You understand what I told you then.
dialog: I can't just give you new irises.
dialog: The Scanners will read the scar
text: tissue. Alarms will go off.
speaker_heading: ANDERSOIN
dialog: I'm a cop, I know
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: I gotta take your eyes out.
dialog: Anderson knows this, too, wishes Doc would shut up ANDERSON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: And put in new ones.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Yeah. I get it, DOC.
text: Anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the
text: operating table. He lies down.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Do me quick before I run out of here.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 53.
text: Anderson lies there, blinking up at the ceiling. He listens
text: to Doc preparing instrument trays. It's a bad sound.
speaker_heading: EXT. THE SPRAWL -- DAY
dialog: The suspension bridge where we saw Anderson vaporize the
dialog: Python transport. Witwer stands watching as a Precrime
text: techno-unit sifts through the white ashes.
text: Witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the
dialog: Potomac. It's a pose a track dog might hold, nose up, testing
dialog: the air for a scent.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY
dialog: We can't see anything at first, because Anderson can't see
dialog: anything either. He's in a deep post-surgical haze. DOC'S
text: voice comes to him. It's warped and ugly.
speaker_heading: DOC'S VOICE
dialog: Don't take the bandages off for twenty
dialog: four hours. You'll go blind if you
dialog: do.
dialog: Anderson makes an affirmative grunt. Now we see his
text: surroundings, even though Anderson still can't. He lies in
text: a grungy bed, his head and eyes swathed in white dressings.
text: Doc stands over him.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You're in a room. I had you moved
dialog: here, a couple miles from my place.
dialog: If they find you, they don't find
dialog: me.
text: Anderson grunts weakly.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: A guy will come in, feed you once.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I juiced up the nano-reconstruction
dialog: around your new eyes, 'cause I know
dialog: you're in a hurry.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: (Fuzzily))
dialog: Nano-re ...construction.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: Organic microrobots that reconstruct
dialog: nerves and blood vessels. It'll
dialog: feel like fleas chewing on your
dialog: eyeballs. Don't scratch.
text: Anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages.
dialog: Doc forces them away.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm giving you a bonus, might come
dialog: in handy. Feel this.
text: Doc takes an air-syringe out of his pocket and touches it to
dialog: Anderson's hand.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a temporary paralytic enzyme.
dialog: Someone spots you, you duck into an
dialog: alley, shoot this under your chin.
text: Doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of Anderson's
dialog: chin. Anderson jumps.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: The enzyme turns your facial muscles
dialog: to mush. You won't look like the
dialog: same man.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: DOC
dialog: You tighten up again in about thirty
dialog: minutes. Hurts like nothing you
dialog: ever felt. It's vicious, but
dialog: effective. I'll put it in your bag.
text: Finally, Doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places
text: it on a dresser beside Anderson's bed.
speaker_heading: DOC (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm setting up a timer. When it
dialog: buzzes tomorrow, take off your
dialog: bandages, and get the hell out of
dialog: here.
text: Anderson, groggy, starts to say something else, but then he
text: hears a door open and close, and Doc is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT
text: The Precrime presence mounts on the streets. A couple of
text: units move past the boarding house, but they don't stop.
scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- DAY
text: Anderson sits in a chair, his dressings like a blindfold.
text: He looks like a hostage. He is sweating. Keeps reaching
dialog: for his dressings to scratch, then forces himself not to.
dialog: He speaks to someone we don't yet see. The guy DOC said
dialog: would come.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess I should eat.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You gonna help feed me?
dialog: Now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent
dialog: to help Anderson. It's the rat guy, the thin bald man
dialog: Anderson had roughed up the day before. The guy has a bowl
text: of hot soup in his hands. He stares contemptuously at
dialog: Anderson.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: So how do we do this, pal?
text: The rat guy doesn't say a word. He simply tips the hot soup
text: and it splatters down into Anderson's lap. Anderson cries
text: out in pain and surprise. The guy walks out of the room.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON- THE TIMER
dialog: Twenty hours gone by. Four more to go.
speaker_heading: EXT. THE SPRAWL
dialog: Precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch,
dialog: looking for leads, looking for anything.
scene_heading: INT. THE BOARDING ROOM
text: The TIMER shows one hour to go. Anderson sits in a chair,
text: squirming miserably. His dressings are wet with sweat, and
text: frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked
dialog: at them.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: He is this close to ripping the dressings off
scene_heading: EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY
text: A Precrime transport stops. Two officers get out. One of
text: them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk, and
text: does a read on the boarding house. The other does a read on
text: a pawn shop and bar next door..
dialog: The OFFICER 1 doing Anderson's boarding house, calls to the
dialog: other officer.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1
dialog: Got 27 warm bodies in this place.
dialog: What should it take, three or four
dialog: Spiders?
speaker_heading: OFFICER 2
dialog: Do four. Speed things up, so we can
dialog: go eat.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 56.
text: The Officer 1 opens the back of the transport, and takes out
text: a box. He removes four round BALLS. They are silver, as
dialog: big as billiard balls.
text: He goes up to the boarding house, gets IdentiScanned, and
text: the front door opens. He rolls the balls down a dark hallway.
text: Then he goes back out to the transport, and leans against
text: it, bored. He holds up an electronic clipboard and waits
dialog: for the data to come in.
speaker_heading: INT. THE BUILDING
text: The BALLS roll about eight feet, then suddenly come to
dialog: autolife as they spin. They open like flowers -- flowers
dialog: with legs.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON : A BALL
text: A fist-sized Spider takes shape. On its head is an IdentiScan
text: lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna.
speaker_heading: INT. A ROOM
text: An OLD WOMAN sits at a card table eating a bowl of something
text: unidentifiable. She looks up with annoyance as she sees a
text: spider scuttling across the floor toward her. It makes a
text: CLICKING sound on the floor as it comes. She's poor, living
dialog: in The Sprawl -- she knows the drill. She continues to eat
text: as the SPIDER crawls up the leg of the card table. She barely
text: watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: It's nice to have a little company
text: She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her
text: am and inches up, then moves across her shoulder. It grips
text: her cheek lightly, as the IdentiScan antenna reads her eyes.
text: Then it leaps off her and onto the floor and CLICKS away
dialog: across the linoleum.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE
text: The Precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column
text: with his laser pen, and waits for the next one.
speaker_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM
text: Anderson sits in his chair. He cocks his head, listening.
text: His body tenses. Something feels wrong.
text: The TIMER shows ten minutes to go. Blindfolded for a day
dialog: and a night, Anderson has no idea how much time he has left.
dialog: Three seconds, four hours?
text: A flattened SPIDER squeezes under his door. Anderson tenses
text: as it CLICKS across the floor toward him.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 57.
dialog: He knows that sound.
text: Anderson stumbles up and out of his chair. He starts to
text: grab at his dressings, remembers Doc's warning, and stops
text: himself. The SPIDER waits for him to settle, then CLICKS
dialog: toward him again.
text: Anderson moves around the room, avoiding the Spider. He is
text: dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard. The Spider
text: comes faster. Anderson crashes into a table, brings it down.
dialog: Falls across the bed.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE
text: The Officer 1 squints at his clipboard. One of the Spiders
text: is taking too long. He adjusts his thermal scanner, and
text: sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room.
text: The other Officer 2 finishes reading the pawn shop and the
text: barroom, then wanders over to Officer 1. They both watch the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1
dialog: Stinking drunk.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 2
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Or a guy who doesn't want to get
dialog: read.
speaker_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM
dialog: Anderson forces himself to sit still, because he knows the
text: consequences. The Spider advances, starts up his leg.
text: The TIMER has not buzzed. Anderson can't touch his dressings.
text: The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face. It
text: WHIRS and HUMS trying to adjust its antenna against the
dialog: dressings.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE
text: The officers eye the thermal scanner, as they reach for their
text: mirrored helmets, getting ready to go in.
speaker_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM
text: The Spider crawls all over Anderson's head, trying to get
dialog: past the dressings for a read.
text: Anderson has no choice. None. He starts to lift at his
text: dressing. The Spider senses his cooperation, freezes in
dialog: place.
text: Anderson wants to scream. He unwraps his head, tugs the eye
text: pads away from his eyes. He rips them off. The Spider sits
text: on his shoulder, waiting.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 58.
text: Anderson's eyes are tightly closed. He opens them
speaker_heading: ANDERSON'S POV - BLINDING LIGHT
dialog: Light brighter than a magnesium burn, brighter than a nuclear
dialog: flashpoint. Light to buckle the knees and push the brain
dialog: beyond endurance.
text: And though all this the faraway sound of a BUZZER going off.
text: The TIMER has finally sounded. Anderson's open eyes are
text: streaming with tears, but he has survived the moment.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON'S POV - THE ROOM
dialog: It comes into slow focus The Spider, all business, reads his
text: eyes. Then, as if nothing unusual has occurred, it jumps
text: off his shoulder, and crosses the floor. It flattens, scoots
text: under the door, and is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE
dialog: The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read. They
dialog: pull off their helmets.
speaker_heading: OFFICER 1
dialog: Let's eat.
dialog: They start putting their equipment back into the transport.
speaker_heading: INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM
text: Anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror. His new eyes
dialog: are tender and bloodshot. And they are not blue, like the
dialog: ones he was born with, but a deep brown. Anderson is exactly
dialog: the same, and utterly different.
text: He grabs his duffel bag, and gets the hell out of there.
scene_heading: INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTER'S -- DAY
text: Lisa, looking drawn and scared, sits in Witwer's office.
dialog: Witwer isn't looking too well, either.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: They told me to move into Paul's

dialog: Lisa nods.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LISA

dialog: you won't bring him in dead.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Yeah. But if he shoots a cop ...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Which is what he does four days from
dialog: now, isn't it?
text: Witwer's eyes imp involuntarily to a CLOCK on his desk.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: He'd never hurt you.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: I know that. But the other thing I
dialog: know is -- the Precogs are never
dialog: wrong.
dialog: The words are leading them no place good. They stop talking,
dialog: and just sit there.
speaker_heading: INT. THE SPRAWL
text: Anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with
dialog: several people waiting for the N0.6 Turbo Tram.
dialog: The double decker Tram comes. People get off, then the line
text: starts to move forward as people get on.
text: Anderson fidgets. He's last in line. Each person gets
text: IdentiScanned as he boards. Anderson's putting his new eyes
dialog: to the test. If the scan goes wrong, he's positioned himself
dialog: to run.
text: The woman ahead of him, gets scanned, pays her fare.
text: Anderson's turn. Anderson goes up the steps, and a red beam
dialog: reads his eyes.
text: The Tram DRIVER glances at a monitor beside his steering
text: wheel, then nods at him.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington. Plenty
dialog: of seats in the back.
text: Anderson nods, moves casually to the back. But his jaw
text: muscles are flexing hard, working off the tension.
scene_heading: INT. A WEALTHY HOME - SUBBURIAN WASHINGTON -- NIGHT
text: Senator Malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he

dialog: wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos
text: adorning the cherry wood walls.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 60.
dialog: He's feeling cozy and safe, the way rich people can afford
dialog: to. No IdentiScan Spiders would ever be sent under his doors.
dialog: No intrusions of any sort, nothing that a coiffed secretary
dialog: or a loyal wife wouldn't announce before hand.
dialog: Which is why he doesn't immediately understand the small
text: SOUND at ear level, coming from just behind him. It's a
text: metallic CLICK-CLICK. He turns amiably. His eyes instantly
text: widen, and his knees buckle when he sees he's looking into
text: the barrel of ANDERSON'S cocked gun.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Time to upgrade your alarm system,
dialog: Senator.
text: Senator Malcolm tries to regain his composure. His fear
dialog: embarrasses him.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Your work-up of Witwer. The Security
dialog: Panel would've done one.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why do I kill Witwer?
text: The Senator finds his voice.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: There's no motive.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: There's, always a motive.
text: Anderson presses the gun to the Senator's forehead. He slides
text: the barrel tip back and forth across the Senator's sweaty
text: skin. It makes a greasy red mark.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I could've come to anyone on the
dialog: panel. But I picked you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Of all the shits on that panel, I
dialog: like you least of all. So if this
dialog: gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but
dialog: not, you know, devastated.
text: You can almost see a thought dawning on Senator Malcolm.
text: And then, shockingly he spits in Anderson's face, and turns
text: and walks to the other side of the den. His tone is mocking.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM
dialog: What the fuck was I worried about?
dialog: You can't kill me. The Precogs
dialog: would've seen it.
text: Anderson realizes this, too, lowers his gun. The Senator is
text: even laughing now. For a moment Anderson does nothing, then
text: he moves toward the Senator again.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 61.
text: The Senator stands his ground smugly.
speaker_heading: SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)
dialog: Witwer's clean. You're clean.

speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Tell you something about the Precogs,
dialog: Senator. They're great on murder.
dialog: But it's the little things they fail
dialog: to see.
text: Anderson hits the Senator so hard it bounces him across the
text: floor and into the cherry wood panelling. Several of his

speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Little things like that, for instance.
text: Anderson steps over him, and walks out of the room
scene_heading: INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GLASER
dialog: He's found a room -- he's going to
dialog: sit it out.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Yeah, except for holding a gun to
dialog: senator Malcolm's goddman head in
dialog: his own goddman house last night,
dialog: Anderson's sitting it out!

speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GLASER
dialog: Hes beating the scanners
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: No one beats the scanners.
text: Witwer reaches up, wearily, rubbing his face and eyes with
text: his hands. The fingers dragging across his eyes stop. Then
text: his hands drop away, and he looks at his men.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: He's done his eyes
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GLASER
dialog: But the scarring always
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: He went the whole way. The crazy
dialog: bastard had his eyes removed. New
dialog: ones sewn in.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GLASER
dialog: That takes weeks to heal.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: If you're prepared to go blind, a

text: Witwer's eyes flick to a digital CLOCK on the wall. It's
dialog: something he can't help doing now.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: He's going to do what it takes to

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - THE SUBURBS -- DAY
text: A mother places a carton of milk on a table in front of her
text: teenage son. He pours it into his cereal bowl, then puts
text: the carton down in front of him.
text: There's a flexible Vid-Screen on the side of the carton,
dialog: about the size of a playing card. AS the sleepy kid watches,
text: the disposable Vid-Screen sparkles to life.
dialog: Nothing unusual, they always do that. For advertisements,
dialog: lost kids, or in this case crime bulletins.
dialog: A good one. The kid straightens up.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: THE VID-SCREEN
text: A fully rotating mug shot of PAUL ANDERSON fills the screen,
dialog: followed by vital statistics and details of the precrime

text: The kid watches for a while, then gets bored, and pulls the
text: Dexi-Pops cereal box over and starts reading the back of
dialog: that.
scene_heading: INT. A LIVING ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY
text: A big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch, a bowl of popcorn
text: perched on his belly. He stares at a TV monitor that's the
dialog: size of a twin bed.
dialog: TV
text: Anderson's face fills the monitor. The TV image is so big
dialog: that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence.
dialog: It's like God coming to pay a visit -- even if you want to
dialog: avoid Him you can't.
dialog: The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that. He surfs
text: through a zillion channels, but Anderson's visage is
dialog: omnipresent.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SKY - THE SPRAWL -- DAY
text: Anderson's face fills the skies, too. Witwer and Precrime
dialog: have pulled out all the stops.
text: Advertising dirigibles float by with Anderson's image on it.
text: Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air. There
dialog: are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the
dialog: weather, a special type of cloud.
text: People on the streets look up, briefly interested, then go
dialog: about their business.
scene_heading: EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL
dialog: One person who is paying deep attention to all this is
text: Anderson himself. He stands on a street corner, wearing
text: dark glasses and a fedora, staring at a public video kiosk.
speaker_heading: VIDEO KIOSK
text: The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
text: His mouth slowly opens. He steps
text: back against a wall and slides his

dialog: at the Precog DISC in his cupped
text: hand, then quickly puts it away.
text: He stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather
dialog: around excitedly.
text: CROWDS OF PEOPLE look into the sky, in store windows, at

speaker_heading: SPOKESWOMAN (CONT'D)

dialog: All the way through to the fatal moment.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Oh, Ed ...
text: Anderson shoots him. Witwer slumps, dying. The video stops.

scene_heading: INT. BAR - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT
text: Ennis Page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so
dialog: full of cigarette smoke it doesn't seem capable of supporting
dialog: life. But it supports the kind of life Page is interested
dialog: in.
text: An emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool
text: beside Page. He gives one shake of his head, and she slides
text: away again. His eyes cut to a group of females. He waits
dialog: for the next approach.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON: PAGE
text: as a HAND reaches over his shoulder and places a Precog disc
text: on the bar in front of him. Page makes a sound and tries to
dialog: jump away, as if the disc is something lethal. Which it is,
dialog: in a way.
text: Anderson presses him back down on his stool. Sits next to
text: him. Page stares at him, scared. Anderson looks straight
text: ahead as he speaks.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: "Ennis Page engages the services of

speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: "Page is an obsessive-compulsive

text: You can almost see Page's heart slamming in his chest. He
dialog: tries to hide it with tough talk.
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: I fuck whores and I'm orderly, so
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Something's out of order, Ennis.
dialog: Deeply out of order.
text: Page looks unhappily at the disc on the bar PAGE You got a

speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Not A disc. The disc. When I went
dialog: home sick, I stole it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I took it with me, Ennis. I wasn't
dialog: sick, I was running with the evidence.
dialog: (lets that sink in)
dialog: So how is it that Precrime has one,
dialog: too?
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: (utterly baffled)
dialog: You can't make copies
dialog: Anderson waits. Lets Page work through it.
speaker_heading: PAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's the basis of the system. The
dialog: immutable evidence. Copies are
dialog: impossible.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You went home. A little later, I
dialog: came in with a disc for Mr. Witwer
dialog: to review. I wasn't halfway out the
dialog: door when he cried out.
text: Anderson is barely breathing, he's listening so hard.
speaker_heading: PAGE (CONT'D)
dialog: He was in shock. He showed me. It
dialog: was you shooting him. Then all hell
dialog: broke loose. He had to send the
dialog: Precrime units to your house.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Ennis -- you gave out the same disc
dialog: twice. Less than an hour apart.
dialog: The one I stole. And then another
dialog: one. Of the same event.
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: It's impossible. The Precogs can
dialog: only move forward to new events.
dialog: Into the future. They never repeat.
text: Anderson looks around. Patrons are beginning to look over
text: in his direction, eyes lingering. He rises.
dialog: Page seems in a daze. As an obsessive-compulsive niner, the
dialog: concept of an untidy system is disorienting.
text: Anderson starts to say something to the man, then doesn't.
text: On the way out Anderson gets IdentiScanned. An automatic
speaker_heading: DIGITAL VOICE calls out after him.
speaker_heading: DIGITAL VOICE
dialog: Have a nice night, Mr. Symington

text: A YOUNG GUY with a sparse moustache walks up to a payphone.
text: He picks up, the receiver and immediately gets IdentiScanned.
text: A light goes on, he's about to dial.
text: Anderson appears out of nowhere, shoulders him out of the
text: way. The young guy drops the receiver and stumbles back
text: onto the sidewalk. Anderson grabs the hanging receiver.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GUY
dialog: Hey! Hey, you can't...
text: He reaches for Anderson, then thinks better of it. Anderson

speaker_heading: INTERCUT ANDERSON/LISAS OFFICE

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Paul.
text: Lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Your phone will be bugged. So we

dialog: is enough.
text: Lisa nods, as if he's right there. He is right there, for
dialog: her. This is all she's got.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: When Precrime stormed the house, I
dialog: thought you'd called them. Betrayed
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: LISA

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Of course, I forgive you.

speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: All these people I need to forgive
dialog: me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you think Frank forgave me? All
dialog: I could do for him was send him
dialog: gardenias.
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: I love you.
text: Lisa almost cries out when he hangs up. She flattens herself
text: against a wall. She stays like that for a long moment,
text: pulling the sound of her husband's voice, his words, deep
dialog: inside of herself.
dialog: And then she gets a look, as one of those words registers
dialog: profoundly.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (whispers to herself)
dialog: Frank hated gardenias.
scene_heading: EXT. EAST END CEMETERY - ARLINGTON -- LATER
dialog: A public cemetery along the Potomac. There's not much land
text: left for new graves. A funeral is taking place. A lot of
text: mourners in dark 1950's suits and dresses. The service is
dialog: nearing its end.
text: Frank D'Ignazio's newly dug grave is nearby. Lisa stands
text: there, looking at the temporary marker, and the flowers and
text: wreaths piled up against it.
text: Two rows over, they are lowering the casket into the ground.
text: High in the sky, a PRECRIME HOVERCRAFT, everpresent in Lisa's
text: life, floats in the low clouds with a barely audible WHINE.
text: Lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers.
text: Her hand drifts near a white GARDENIA WREATH. There is a
text: small envelope tucked beneath a blossom. She takes it.
text: Then she rises and begins to walk back to her car.
text: The funeral is over, and the mass of mourners, many wearing
text: dark glasses, fan out toward a long line of cars.
text: One of the MOURNERS brushes past Lisa. She looks up and he
text: tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over
dialog: them at her.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 69.
dialog: It's Anderson. Isn't it? She looks into his eyes. And
text: it's jarring, the blue eyes gone, that they're brown now.
dialog: But it's him, he's there, and she wants to reach out for
dialog: him. Knows she can't.
dialog: He's already moving on. He's risked everything for a look.
text: He slips into the black sea of mourners, she goes to her car
dialog: -neither of them ever breaking stride.
dialog: The Precrime craft hovers, unaware
speaker_heading: INT. LISA'S CAR
text: Lisa opens the envelope as her car drives her down the
dialog: Alexandria-Washington ConnectWay.
text: A Precog DISC falls into her hand. Her mouth opens -- she's
dialog: never held one before.
dialog: And there is a NOTE with it It READS:
dialog: "The Precogs generated duplicate discs. This is the first.
dialog: Precrime has the second. Duplicates. Why?"
scene_heading: EXT. A CONVENIENCE STORE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY
text: Anderson has to eat bad food quickly, and on the run. He
text: gathers up a wrapped sandwich, a bag of donuts, something to
dialog: drink.
text: He waits in line. He doesn't like to be in a line, waiting.
text: The woman ahead of him argues about change. He presses his
dialog: lips together.
text: And then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera
text: DOME attached to the ceiling. It gives him a fish eye
dialog: reflected VIEW of what's happening behind him.
text: Precrime police are happening behind him. He doesn't stop
text: to ponder, as two Python transports zoom up outside the store.
text: Anderson vaults the counter, knocking the customer and the
dialog: clerk to the floor.
speaker_heading: INT. BACK ROOM
text: Anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can. He hears the
dialog: mechanically altered COMMANDS of a Precrime officer calling
dialog: from the store.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Paul Anderson. Drop to your hands
dialog: and knees!
text: Anderson crashes out into an alley, and clambers up a fence.
text: SONIC BLASTS shatter the air around him. Chunks of brick
text: fly off the walls on both sides. But he is full of
dialog: adrenaline, and there is no stopping him.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. A TURBOTRAM - THE SPRAWL -- LATER
text: A different part of the city. Anderson hunkers low in the
dialog: back seat of a tram.
text: He looks up, as the DRIVER swears
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: What the hell --
text: Anderson stands up, looks down the aisle, through the
dialog: windshield. Precrime transports are heading straight at the
dialog: tram, going the wrong way on a one way avenue.
dialog: They've even taken radio control of the P.A. system on the
dialog: tram.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Paul Anderson. Drop to your hands
dialog: and knees!
dialog: Anderson can't believe it -- how are they suddenly pinpointing
dialog: him? The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare
dialog: at him, terrified.
text: Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit
text: doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street.
text: He rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into
text: his bag for a glove. He pulls the weapon onto his right
text: hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament.
dialog: Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the
text: street. He looks up. He is surrounded by skyscrapers and
text: buildings -- he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban
dialog: canyon.
dialog: People freeze against the sides of buildings, run into
dialog: doorways where they can. Passengers in trans and taxis or
text: cars stay there, pressed against their windows watching.
text: Nothing moves, except the Python transports, closing in.
dialog: The lead officer speaks, with that menacing electronically
speaker_heading: altered VOICE.
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lower your weapon, or we will
dialog: neutralize your threat potential.
dialog: The Precrime police are out of the transports now, advancing
text: at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men.
text: Anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building
dialog: closest to him.
scene_heading: ANDERSON'S POV - A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT
text: The large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 71.
text: Anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward
text: it, his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement.
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do not move!
text: Anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the
dialog: building, right beside the high pressure hydrant.
text: He stops, looks up, looks down, looks at the police advancing.
text: It is a moment for prayer. Anderson doesn't have a moment.
text: He spreads his feet and fires a massive SONIC BLAST down at
dialog: the sidewalk. The effect on the underground water main is
dialog: immediate.
text: A GEYSER of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up
dialog: from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen
text: feet into the air right alongside the building.
text: The stunned police officers try to take aim, but Anderson's
dialog: bouncing at the top of the geyser. And they can't fire,
dialog: anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement
dialog: from every window in the building.
text: All this in a time span of seconds. The world spins crazily
text: for ANDERSON, but he manages to grip hold of a metal support
text: beam holding the building's sign, one story up.
dialog: The police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of
text: water from the water main break obscures his moves.
text: He pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along
text: it toward a second story window. The office building gawkers
text: lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to
text: sparkling dust and leaps inside.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING
dialog: The building covers almost an entire city block. Anderson,
text: dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting
text: through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way.
text: He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field,
dialog: jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever
dialog: he must to get to his goal.
text: And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the
text: avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime
dialog: ambushed him.
text: He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream
text: of traffic. It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers.
text: Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of
text: the bus. It is a bone-jarring landing. He loses
dialog: consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof,
text: and slides off it onto the pavement.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 72.
text: He lies there, trying to rouse himself. Traffic brakes to a
dialog: stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in
dialog: the road. No one wants to touch him. A single car horn
dialog: SOUNDS, and then a chorus of them.
text: Anderson rouses, struggles to his feet, and takes off in a
dialog: limping run.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION LATER
text: Anderson, out of breath and in pain, leans against a post at
text: the far end of the passenger platform. There are tracks on
dialog: either side of him, one marked "Uptown" and the other
dialog: "Downtown. "
text: He feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that
text: the Downtown train is coming in. And on his left, too, the
text: Uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view.
dialog: Which MagLev train will lead him to safety? Which one won't
text: they pinpoint? He runs up to a teenage KID who has his arm
text: around his girlfriend. They step back, startled. He's got
text: a flat top hair cut, she wears a pleated skirt and saddle
dialog: shoes.
dialog: The trains pull in.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Pick one for me!
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THEY TRY TO WALK AWAY
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Point to the train I should take.
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I don't know.
text: The girl lifts a nervous finger and points. The Uptown. He
text: runs to board it, as they run in the opposite direction to
dialog: the Downtown.
speaker_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR
text: He sits at the back of the half empty train watching the
dialog: dark rush by. A train chosen arbitrarily -- it's impossible
dialog: they could find him.
text: A station Stop. He starts to get off, is actually on the
text: platform, then steps back onto the train.
text: The rushing dark again. When the MagLev eases to a halt at
dialog: the next station he gets off this time.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: INT. STATION
text: He walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people.
text: He eases back and lets them go up first.
speaker_heading: THE STAIRS
text: Precrime officers crouch around the bend, silently snatching
text: people out of the way as they come into view. They wait
dialog: -but Anderson does not come. And he does not come.
text: On signal, the Precrime officers rush down the stairs.
speaker_heading: DOORWAY ABOVE THE STAIRS
text: ANDERSON hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling,
text: adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive BindFoam.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON'S POV - THE OFFICERS
text: as they run below him down the stairs. They go out of sight,
text: he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for
dialog: him.
text: The strain of hanging by one arm is killing him. He reaches
text: up. With a laser knife, and cuts away at his coat sleeve,
text: releasing himself from the glob. He drops to the stairs,
text: and instantly slips up them.
text: He surprises a helmeted OFFICER, just around the bend. He
text: slams HIM against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds
dialog: the laser knife against his throat.
text: The OFFICER 1s clearly terrified. He speaks hoarsely through
dialog: Anderson's choking grip.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Don't kill me! Jesus. Please.
text: Anderson looks at the panicked officer. Anderson closes his
text: eyes trying to put it together. He opens them.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: But the Precogs would've predicted
dialog: me killing you. You'd know whether
dialog: I do or not.
text: The officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy.
text: Anderson suddenly gets it. He tightens his grip on the man.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: They shut down the system. Haven't
dialog: they? They've shut down the Precogs.
dialog: The officer nods.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: They're off homicides. They're
dialog: redirecting them to help us locate
dialog: you.
dialog: Which is how they knew where he'd be every time.
text: Anderson chops quickly at the base of the man's skull,
dialog: knocking him out. And then he runs, because what else can
dialog: he do?
scene_heading: INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY
text: Lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door, labeled:

dialog: hall, other courtrooms are in use, but not this one. She
text: enters the dark and vacant Courtroom 17.
speaker_heading: INT. COURTROOM 17
text: Lisa sits at the judge's bench in the empty courtroom. The
dialog: lights are dim.
text: She takes a small, battery-powered tv out of her briefcase.
dialog: She turns it on.
dialog: TV
dialog: The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and

dialog: hotline number: "1-800-PRECRIME." Then- "Call Now! Call
dialog: Now!
speaker_heading: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: Now Lisa takes out the Precog disc Anderson gave to her -the
dialog: first disc.
text: She places it in the specialized monitor on the judge's bench.
text: The tv and the judge's monitor sit side by side. The tv
dialog: plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the
text: judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc.
text: She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from
dialog: one version to the other. They seem absolutely identical.
text: When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again.
text: Lisa stares, watching her husband murder his best friend,
dialog: endlessly.
scene_heading: EXT. A GAS STATION - ALEXANDRIA -- DAY
text: A gas station right out of the fifties. An attendant in a

text: In the background, Anderson walks toward a men's room.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: INT. THE MEN'S ROOM
text: Anderson looks at himself in the mirror. He reaches out and
text: touches one reflected eye, which is a deep brown. It is
text: still startling to him, the color of his eyes.
text: Then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air
text: syringe Doc gave to him. He looks at it nervously. It is
text: filled with 5 cc's of an opaque green liquid.
text: He touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin.
text: He closes his eyes. Then he screws up his courage, and hits
text: the plunger. The liquid is pneumatically delivered with a
dialog: searing HISS.
text: Anderson screams out in agony, slams back against the wall
text: of the bathroom. His hands reach up for his face -- which
text: looks like it's boiling from within.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON'S FACE
text: The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker. The muscle tone
text: around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old
dialog: man's. That is the effect -- like he is aging fifty years.
text: His forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop. Healthy
text: pink is replaced by bloodless gray.
dialog: AND MOTHER OF GOD DOES IT HURT
speaker_heading: EXT. THE MEN'S ROOM
text: The ATTENDANT knocks nervously on the door
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: You all right in there?
text: When the door opens, an unhealthy looking old guy with a

text: Anderson nods, and walks past the attendant, who watches
text: after him uncertainly as he wanders off.
scene_heading: INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER
dialog: The perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around

dialog: There are ten people in the group, and the physically

text: Anderson moves up close to her, a little too close. He
text: whispers to her, embarrassed. She gives him a professional
text: smile, and points in the distance past the elevators.
text: Anderson nods, and heads off. She calls after him.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll wait right here for you, sir!
speaker_heading: INT. A STAIRWELL
text: Anderson runs down a back stairwell to a lower floor.
scene_heading: INT. A BASEMENT CORRIDOR
dialog: Anderson stands outside a door marked: "Housekeeping." Above
dialog: the doorway is an IdentiScan device.
text: Anderson reaches into his coat and carefully removes a small
dialog: cryo-jar.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON: THE CRYO-JAR
dialog: Imbedded in the clear gelatinous coolant are two eyeballs
dialog: -the irises a luminous blue.
scene_heading: INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The operations room in Precrime. The technicians sit at
dialog: their computers and holographic tracking displays.
text: Witwer paces among them. His eyes keep flicking to the
text: digital clock on the wall. Then they cut back to the men
dialog: and machines that are telling him nothing. Witwer does not
dialog: look well at all, When a TECHNICIAN leans close to his
text: computer monitor,Witwer almost leaps across the room to get
text: to him. He looks over the man's shoulder.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Must be a glitch ...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Anderson just got IdentiScanned.
text: Witwer grips the back of the technician's chair. The
dialog: technician types the data through again.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's him -- he's been scanned.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Where is he?
text: The technician looks up at Witwer.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: But he's had his eyes done. Right?
dialog: Sir? Tries to think it through.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: He had to have.
text: The technician's computer flashes the next piece of
dialog: information. When he speaks, it's the last thing Witwer
dialog: wants to hear.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Jesus Christ, sir. He's in the
dialog: basement of this building.
text: All eyes turn to Witwer. The unspoken question hangs in the
dialog: air. Anderson's come to murder Witwer?
speaker_heading: INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS
dialog: Throughout the building, every available Precrime Officer
text: begins to receive orders to mobilize toward the basement.
speaker_heading: INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER
text: Four officers stand guard in the chamber. They listen to
text: the orders coming in on their earpieces. Three of the guards
text: rush out of the room, one stays behind.
dialog: The three Precogs sit in their oversized chairs, the female
text: in the middle, the males on either side of her. Their eyes
dialog: are open ... and they are deeply alert.
text: Two technicians tend to the Precogs. At the back of the
text: chamber, through a large window, we see Ennis Page sitting
dialog: at the huge mainframe.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND
text: A ring of Precrime officers three men deep stand guard around
dialog: Witwer. Witwer looks like he wants to kill them all.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: This is ridiculous.
dialog: Lieutenant Glaser replies forcefully
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GLASER
dialog: Standing orders from the Security
dialog: Panel, sir.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: If he wants to get to me, he'll get
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GLASER
dialog: No, he won't, sir.
text: Witwer looks at the confident young officer almost pityingly.
text: Then his eyes flick to the wall clock.
speaker_heading: INT. THE BASEMENT
dialog: Armed Precrime officers clog the corridors, conducting
dialog: defensive searches of one room after another. All they are
dialog: coming up with so far are some very startled housekeepers.
speaker_heading: INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER
dialog: In the chamber are one guard, two technicians, and three
dialog: Precogs. And all of them are left in sudden darkness, as
dialog: the power is cut.
speaker_heading: INT. SEARCH AND COMMAND
dialog: The officers around Witwer reach for their maglite
dialog: flashlights. The Search and Command room suddenly looks
dialog: exceedingly vulnerable.
text: A technician calls out from the darkness
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Don't worry, air -emergency generators
dialog: will kick on in five seconds.
text: The green glow from a roomful of wristwatches makes the room
text: seem alive with fireflies. Five seconds go by. Then ten
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Explanation, please!
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Uh, sir. It seems ... he got the
dialog: generators, too.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 79.
text: There is a long moment of silence. And then Witwer begins
dialog: to laugh.
speaker_heading: INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER
text: The room is utterly dark and silent. The silence is broken
text: by the SOUND of something rolling across the floor. Somebody
dialog: speaks, probably the guard.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Shit.
text: An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts.
dialog: And leaping through the light is ANDERSON. The temporarily
text: blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees.
dialog: Anderson stun guns them quickly.
text: The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor.
dialog: We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features
dialog: are returning to normal.
text: He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs. It is the
dialog: equipment he is after.
text: Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in
dialog: horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the
dialog: Precog helmets to the mainframe.
text: Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing
text: it out and knocking Page unconscious. Then he reaches into
text: the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of
dialog: blasts.
dialog: Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a
text: PRESENCE behind him. Perhaps it is because the movement is
dialog: so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection.
text: A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes
dialog: hold of his hand.
text: Anderson whirls around, weapon out. And there before him,
text: is the FEMALE Precog. He looks at her, then beyond her to
dialog: the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in
dialog: their chairs.
text: Her helmet is off. She is young, but her close-cropped hair
dialog: is silver white. And when she speaks, her voice is like the
dialog: wind whispering through time.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Save us, Anderson.
dialog: Anderson can feel the seconds ticking away, his carefully
dialog: planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I have to get out of here.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 80.
text: She grips his hand.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Save us.
dialog: It is beyond pitiful, this frail little woman, pleading.
dialog: And her eyes, she won't let him go. She is beginning to
text: weaken, to sway on her feet.
text: A sudden realization floods over Anderson.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: You let me get here, didn't you?
dialog: You stopped giving them information,
dialog: so they couldn't track me.
text: The Precog female is fading fast. She tries to reach out
dialog: for him and her legs give way.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Save --
dialog: And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls?
dialog: What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the
dialog: fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom.
speaker_heading: INT. TUDICIAL CENTER
text: Lisa has been staring at the judge's monitor and the tv screen
dialog: for over an hour. The two versions of Anderson murdering
dialog: Witwer play over and over.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (wearily, to herself)
dialog: Help me, Paul.
text: She hits freeze-frame on the judge's monitor, at a moment
dialog: during his confrontation with Witwer when Anderson's FACE
dialog: fills the screen.
text: Lisa looks with deep urgency into her husband's eyes.
dialog: And it is his EYES, finally, that tell her everything. Lisa's
text: hand rises to her open mouth.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: They're blue.
text: She keeps the image on freeze-frame, and turns and looks at
dialog: the tv, which shows Precrime's disc over and over, the 1-800
text: number scrolling along the bottom.
text: When the same close-up of Anderson flashes onto the tv screen,
text: she leans close to it and squints.
text: Anderson stares right back at her. And for the first time,
dialog: Lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical. His
dialog: eyes...
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: And now they're brown.
text: For the first time in days she allows herself a small smile.
speaker_heading: INT. PRECOG CHAMBER
dialog: Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters. Witwer
text: walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber. EMT teams
dialog: work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson
dialog: has left in his wake.
dialog: Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs, the
text: brothers. Their eyes are closed and they are limp. Their
text: lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other.
text: Lieutenant Glaser is with him, but when Witwer speaks it is
dialog: almost to himself.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Why didn't the Precogs know he was
dialog: coming to do this?
text: The Lieutenant has no reply. Witwer runs both hands through
dialog: his hair. It has begun to wear him down, the ticking of the
dialog: clock ...
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: The next time he shows up it'll be
dialog: to kill me.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GLASER
dialog: We won't let that happen, sir.
text: Witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him, then gives the
dialog: Lieutenant a withering look.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: You won't, huh?
text: When the Lieutenant tries to speak to him, Witwer walks away
dialog: and goes over to the technicians working on the Precogs. He
dialog: stares at the Precogs.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: (to a technician)
dialog: When can we get these things
dialog: operational?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: They're a hive mind, sir. It takes
dialog: three for their predictive abilities
dialog: to be fully operational.
dialog: Which Witwer does not want to hear. Witwer leans very close
dialog: to the technician.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: These two are all I have to find the
dialog: man who is about to murder me. Hook
dialog: them up, and flood them with whatever
dialog: kind of fucking chemicals you have
dialog: to. They are a machine, and I need
dialog: that machine at my disposal.
text: The Precogs's lips stop for a microsecond, and then begin
dialog: their silent movements again.
scene_heading: INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE - ALEXANDRIA -- NIGHT
text: Ennis Page is a man unglued. He sits on a tidy little sofa,
text: in a tidy 1950's style living room. But his movements have
text: become untidy. He puts a very tiny pill on his tongue.
text: When he drinks from a glass of water, it dribbles down his
dialog: chin onto his shirt. Not like Ennis, at all.
text: When his doorbell RINGS, he slowly looks up, then looks down
text: at the floor again. He doesn't answer it. It RINGS some
dialog: more.
dialog: And then Lisa is standing there before him
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis. I
dialog: could just walk in here.
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: I forgot. To turn it on.
text: She sits down beside him.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You don't look surprised to see me.
text: She glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside
dialog: him, three gone.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: I need your help.
text: Unexpectedly, tears well up in Ennis's eyes.
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: He took one of my babies.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: He's desperate, Ennis. He had to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We have to help him.
text: Lisa holds the Precog disc in front of his eyes. He closes
dialog: them against the sight, as if it were an evil talisman.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a fake Ennis.
text: Ennis's eyes open again.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the first disc. You delivered
dialog: it to Director Anderson. He reviewed
dialog: it. And then he stole it, and went
dialog: on the run.
text: Ennis tries to think through his fear and haze. His words
dialog: slur.
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: I delivered ... a fake .. to him?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: But he thought it was real, and ran
dialog: with it.
dialog: The pills, his tidy world coming apart -- Ennis is losing
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: An hour later, you delivered a second
dialog: disc of the same event. Witwer
dialog: reviewed it. It was real. (Beat)
dialog: How do I know this?
dialog: Ennis just wants her to go away. He wants it all to go away.
text: Tears stream down his face.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: Director Anderson had his eyes
dialog: changed. They were blue. Now he
dialog: has brown ones.
text: Ennis is sliding away. Lisa takes hold of him. Makes him
text: listen, dammit. She points to the disc in her hand.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: This disc, the fake one, shows a
dialog: blueeyed Anderson murdering Witwer
dialog: two days from now. He doesn't have
dialog: blue eyes anymore. The person who
dialog: faked this disc had no idea he would
dialog: change his eyes.
dialog: Lisa shakes him.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen! But the second disc has to
dialog: be real, because he has brown eyes
dialog: when he murders Witwer.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Somebody tried to frame him with a
dialog: fake. And somehow it all became real.
dialog: Why, Ennis? How could this happen?
text: Ennis gives her a look that's on the other side of
dialog: comprehension.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: You handle the discs. How did a
dialog: fake one get delivered?
text: Ennis's eyes roll back into his head.
dialog: PAGE Coffee ...
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: You want-- ?
speaker_heading: PAGE
dialog: He spilled coffee everywhere ...
dialog: Everywhere ...
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What coffee? What are you -- ?
text: But Ennis sags unconscious. She shakes him hard, even slaps
text: him, but Ennis is out. She lets him drop down on the sofa.
text: From outside the house, somewhere high in the clouds, comes
dialog: the WHINE of a hovercraft.
text: Lisa looks once more at Ennis, then gets out of there
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT
text: A small, dreary room, invisible with insignificance. Which
dialog: is just the kind of room you want if you've stolen a Precog.
text: The female Precog lies on a cot. Anderson sits on a metal
dialog: folding chair watching her.
text: Her eyes slowly open and look at him
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: My brothers aren't here.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: You didn't even look around. You
dialog: knew.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We can sense each other. You must
dialog: save
text: Anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Stop. I saved You. It was the best
dialog: I could do.
text: She turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall.
text: There is a fading pink cabbage rose. She traces the outline
dialog: of it with her thin finger.
text: She turns back to him.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Thank you, Anderson.
text: It is deeply eerie for him, chatting with a Precog.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: What am I going to do with you?
text: Her eyes grow very serious.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Name me, Anderson.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Give me a name. I've never had one.
text: Anderson rises, moves around the small room. He is shamed,
dialog: embarrassed.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Listen.
text: She turns to the wall.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen to me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Listen to me ... Rose.
text: It is heartrendingly touching, the smile she gives him when
text: she faces him again.
speaker_heading: FEMALE
dialog: Rose.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Rose. They shifted your precognition
dialog: so you would locate me.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yes. And it hurt us, physically.
dialog: Did you know that? The helmets, the
dialog: controls. It hurts.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: (guiltily)
dialog: I didn't know.
dialog: For a long moment he can't say anything. But there are things
dialog: he needs to understand ...
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: When they shifted you to find me,
dialog: you didn't reveal everything. That
dialog: I was going to break into Precrime.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: We saw our chance. You would need
dialog: to shut us down, you would have to
dialog: come. We wanted you to come.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: You used me -- to save you.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I have been used all my life,
dialog: Anderson.
dialog: Anderson can't meet her eyes.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: No one cared that we were human.
dialog: From a human mother. Taken at birth.
dialog: Hooked to machines.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We have been alive, Anderson.
dialog: Enslaved, for the greater good.
dialog: Her words are unbearable, for both of them. She traces the
text: outline of the wallpaper rose again.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: But now I have a name. And I know
dialog: the man who has named - me will not
dialog: allow me to be enslaved again.
text: Anderson looks at her, then goes to the window, carefully
dialog: watches the street below.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Rose. What's going to happen to us?
dialog: Can you see that?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I'm weak. And away from my brothers.
dialog: I see glimpses and hints of things
dialog: nearby. But it's all ... scattered.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm tired of the future, Anderson.
text: She lies on the bed, watching as Anderson comes back to her.
text: He sits carefully on the side of her bed.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 87.
text: Then be reaches out, and gently touches her cheek
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: You didn't know I was going to do
dialog: that, did you?
dialog: She is almost too overwhelmed to speak
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: No. Oh, Anderson. It was lovely.
dialog: And now it is Anderson who is overwhelmed
scene_heading: INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE DAWN
dialog: If he were not already dead, it would've killed Ennis Page
dialog: to see the state of his living room. Precrime officers
text: everywhere. Blood on the rug. A gun beside the sofa.
text: Witwer stands in the corner of the room witching the Coroner
text: crab walk Page's body. It WHIRS and CLICKS as it probes and
dialog: takes samples from various sites.
text: The holographic doctor waits patiently as the Coroner crab
dialog: makes its determinations.
dialog: Lieutenant Glaser talks quietly to Witwer
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GLASER
dialog: Who else could it've been?
text: The crab probes the ragged hole in Page's head
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONT'D)
dialog: He grabbed a Precog so he could commit
dialog: an undetected murder.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Page worshipped the system. He fell
dialog: apart. Shot himself.
text: The Lieutenant rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT GLASER
dialog: Anderson.
text: Witwer doesn't say anything. He just stares at the body The
text: crab finishes. The holographic doctor unfolds his arms and
text: turns his head to Witwer. He is only a computer interface,
dialog: but even so, it seems as if there is surprise in his
dialog: digitalized voice.
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
dialog: Director Witwer. This event is a
dialog: positive homicide.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: A mortal wound was generated by a

dialog: left occipital portion of the anterior
dialog: skull, on June 16th, 2040, at 1:24
dialog: am, Eastern Standard Time. A Phase
dialog: Two Investigation is in order.
dialog: No one says anything as the holographic doctor dematerializes
text: and the Coroner crab walks across the floor and puts itself
dialog: back in its box.
text: At last, someone moves. It is Witwer. He lifts his arm,
text: pulls back his shirtsleeve, and stares long and hard at his
dialog: watch.
scene_heading: INT. WITWER'S OFFICE -- DAY LATER
text: Lisa sits biting her lip as Witwer watches two monitors play
text: the two versions of Anderson's murder of Witwer. Lisa points.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: There.
text: She reaches down and freezes on a close-up of Anderson on
dialog: the two monitors.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON - THE MONITORS
text: On the left monitor Anderson has blue eyes, on the right he

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: The one on the left, the first disc
dialog: -it's a fake. He doesn't have blue
dialog: eyes anymore.
dialog: Witwer stares for a long time.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: A fake.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But the Precogs predict the infallible
dialog: truth. They don't emit fake discs.
dialog: And now Lisa smiles. She has set her lawyerly mind to the
dialog: solution. It is her moment
dialog: .
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Exactly. You can't tamper with the
dialog: Precogs, induce them to make fakes
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But that doesn't mean someone couldn't
dialog: have made a fake disc on their own
dialog: and inserted it into the delivery
dialog: system.
dialog: The simplicity of it is inconceivable. Witwer speaks
dialog: carefully, trying to process it
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake
dialog: disc in with that day's real ones...
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (excited)
dialog: We're all programmed to believe
dialog: anything we see on a Precog disc.
dialog: The system has never been wrong ...
text: Witwer stares at the proof before him. -- the different
text: colored eyes of Anderson. He ejects both discs and holds
dialog: them in his hands.
speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to call off the hunt. He
dialog: was set up.
text: Witwer looks at the two discs he is holding
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: It's gone too far, Lisa She shakes
dialog: her head, shocked at his response
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: He was set up! You both were. If
dialog: Paul kills you, you're both out of
dialog: the picture.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Who wants us out? Of what picture?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing! And
dialog: then we can investigate Witwer's

dialog: again.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Ennis Page was murdered last night.
dialog: The blood drains from Lisa's face
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything points to Paul.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: He's not a murderer.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: I think he is. A murderer ... and a
dialog: future murderer.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Lisa. What does it matter that the
dialog: first disc is a fake ... if the second
dialog: one's real?
text: Witwer's hands close tight on the discs. Lisa stands there,
text: motionless. Then she turns, and leaves his office, abruptly.
text: He watches her go.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY
text: Rose sits in a chair near the window. She is chewing lightly
text: on a cracker. Her face shows wonder -- at the cracker's
text: texture and taste. She holds it up and admires its shape.
dialog: Anderson's mood is less wondrous
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Rose. Listen to me. I'm going to
dialog: leave you here. I have to keep
dialog: moving.
speaker_heading: ROSE'S SMILE ABRUPTLY VANISHES
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: No. You must save my brothers.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: It's impossible. There's no time.
dialog: I've done what I can do!
text: Rose waits for him to finish. She looks out the window at
dialog: the street scene.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Come here, Anderson.
dialog: He does, reluctantly.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you see that boy in the blue hat
dialog: walking with his mother?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: In sixty seconds he will walk beneath

scene_heading: ANDERSON'S POV - THE BOY AND THE WORKERS
text: Two men struggle to lift a large window in place. Way below
text: the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk
text: holding his mother's hand.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: They'll drop the window, killing
dialog: him. It is impossible to save him.
text: Anderson turns to her, shocked And then he runs for the door,
text: hurls it open, and disappears down the hall.
text: Rose listens to his FOOTSTEPS crashing down the stairs
text: EXT. THE STREET.
text: Even as Anderson rushes out of the boarding house, the WORKERS
dialog: have lost their grip on the window.
text: The little BOY in the blue hat and his MOTHER walk unwittingly
text: toward disaster. They do not appear to hear the MEN'S cries.
text: The WINDOW falls end over end above the boy's head. The
text: sunlight sparks off of the glass, so that from a distance it
text: looks like a star falling from the sky.
text: A WOMAN across the street sees what is happening, and cries
dialog: out.
dialog: But what Anderson does is run. He runs faster and harder
dialog: than humanly possible. He does not care if he is recognized
text: or hit by a passing taxi. He is going to get to that boy.
dialog: He has to get to that boy ...
text: ANDERSON rams the BOY from behind just as the corner of the
text: window frame kisses the boy's blue hat. He knocks the boy
text: to safety as glass and metal SMASH into the sidewalk.
text: The mother does not even have time to scream. She is on the
dialog: ground, stunned, But Anderson has saved the boy.
text: He rolls away, and gets to his feet. Before anyone can put
dialog: together what has happened, Anderson has ducked into an alley,
dialog: and is gone.
speaker_heading: INT. THE ROOM - LATER
text: Anderson enters the room again, out of breath, some small
text: cuts on his face and hands. He stands across the room staring
dialog: at Rose.
text: Rose considers him. When she speaks her voice is near and
dialog: distant at the same time. For Anderson, it is as if the
text: words are coming from a place inside his own head.

dialog: But unlike before, large bore needles have been placed in

dialog: Witwer has his back to all this. He stands with Dr. Resfield,

speaker_heading: ANDERSON

scene_heading: INT. CITY STREET ALEXANDRIA

text: payphones, video kiosks ... oblivious. People push past
dialog: her.
text: On a street corner, as she waits at a red light, the payphone
text: beside her begins to RING. If she hears it, she gives no
text: indication. A KID reaches for it, listens, hangs up.
text: She walks on. Stores. Restaurants. An art gallery. As

speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: ANDERSON'S VOICE

scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY STATION
text: Lisa starts up the stairs. She looks at her watch, then
dialog: makes herself pause a few moments, to keep within Anderson's
text: time frame. She starts up again.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (V.O.)
dialog: As you come around the bend, cry out
dialog: and turn around and slap the
dialog: officer...
text: Lisa does this, and the officer reels back, surprised. At the
text: same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into
text: view, and see this happening. Lisa starts to run. When the

speaker_heading: ANDERSON (V.O.)
dialog: Stay on Ninth street. Underneath

dialog: out to him.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Two hundred dollars if you don't

dialog: It's The Sprawl -- stranger things have happened. He grabs

scene_heading: EXT. NINTH STREET LATER
text: Lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky.
text: It is dense with holographic billboards, skim-jets,
dialog: dirigibles. Somewhere in all that is a Precrime hovercraft.
dialog: And the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (V.O.)
dialog: The hovercraft will try to drop

dialog: Precrime loses you. You'll have to

speaker_heading: EXT. THE SPRAWL
text: Lisa walks hurriedly down a side street. She stands out in
dialog: her white dress -- a spot of vulnerable color in world of
dialog: black.
text: Too vulnerable to pass up. A MAN in a gray overcoat slides
text: out from between two buildings in front of her. He is not
text: coy about his intent. He comes straight at her, all business.
text: Lisa freezes in place. She looks at her watch. The man
text: grabs her by the shoulder. When she starts to scream, he
text: claps his hand over her mouth, hard.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your
dialog: teeth out.
text: Her eyes look around frantically. He starts to drag her
dialog: backwards into the dark.
text: ANDERSON leaps into view, and slams the man's head into a
text: light post. It takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens
text: his grip on Lisa. His legs at last collapse under him.
text: Anderson scoops Lisa off the ground. She hugs him hard.
text: Then pulls back from him. She gives him a look.
speaker_heading: LISA

scene_heading: INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- LATER
text: Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson
dialog: together.
text: Lisa needs to touch him. She keeps a hand on his arm, brushes
text: back a loose look of his hair. Rose is mesmerized by her
dialog: actions. She drinks in everything, every bit of life.
text: Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation. They speak to
dialog: each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room.
dialog: Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Two discs. One fake. One real.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I don't think there were supposed to
dialog: be two. Whoever planned it, wasn't
dialog: counting on two.
text: They are silent for a long time. Rose watches them work it
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: An infallible system. Every disc
dialog: ever generated has been true ...
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Somebody wants you out of the way --
dialog: so they make a fake disc. Who ever
dialog: doubts the discs?
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I never doubted it. I saw it. And
dialog: believed it, absolutely. I was
dialog: certain I was going to murder Witwer.
text: Anderson is shaking. Lisa wraps her arms around him. His
text: voice is a stunned whisper.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: I saw the fake, and believed so much
dialog: in the system, that I saw myself as
dialog: a murderer.
dialog: (beats)
dialog: And the Precogs picked up those
dialog: thoughts ...
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: And generated the second disc. The
dialog: real one.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: A self-fulfilling prophesy. I
dialog: believed it was true. And that made
dialog: it true.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

text: Anderson and Lisa turn and look at Rose. She lies curled on

speaker_heading: ROSE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: ANDERSON

dialog: Straight ahead ...
text: Rose stares stright ahead ...
speaker_heading: MEMORY HIT
text: Rose sits in her chair in the Precog Chamber. Her brothers

dialog: technicians tend to them.
text: Rose's eyes are open. She sees everything in the room. The
text: technicians, the machines ... and across the room a large
text: window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe
dialog: computer.
dialog: Rose watches through the window ...
dialog: As the computer emits discs, Page gathers them
speaker_heading: ROSE (V.O.)
dialog: Ed Witwer entered Page's office.
text: Witwer carries a mug of coffee.
text: Ennis Page goes red in the face, stares at the coffee. Speaks
dialog: to Witwer, angrily, pointing to the coffee. We can't hear
dialog: the words.
speaker_heading: ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Page was so upset at the sight of
dialog: the coffee.
text: Witwer goes to put the coffee down on a small table. It
dialog: tips, and spills.
text: Page looks like his head will explode. He pulls a neatly
text: folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops
text: to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the
text: coffee stain on his spotless rug.
speaker_heading: ROSE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket,
dialog: reached over Page and put it in one
dialog: of the open cases.

dialog: the Precog Chamber, but the only one watching him is Rose --
dialog: and what does she matter?

speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't understand what I'd seen.

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: The perfect system -brought down by

speaker_heading: ANDERSON

dialog: of the Precog system.
text: Lieutenant Glaser has his orders. He begins to approach.
text: And as he does, Witwer swivels his chair around, and lifts

scene_heading: EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD -- LATER
text: Witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete
text: building that houses the lab. The lights are out in all the
dialog: windows except the back section of the second floor. There,
dialog: the lights burn brightly.
text: Witwer sees Precrime officers posted at intervals around it.
text: He smiles as if he knows something they don't. He looks at
text: his watch. It is a cool night, but his face is slick with
dialog: sweat.
text: He walks to the entrance of the building. An OFFICER 1s
dialog: startled to see him.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Things quiet?
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Sir. Should you ... be here?
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: There's been a development. A body's
dialog: been found in the Sprawl.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Anderson's?
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: They're checking it out. I need to

speaker_heading: INT. THE LAB
text: Dr. Resfield looks up as Witwer strides into the lab, carrying
dialog: a tv under his arm. Witwer is the last person he wants to
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Borrowed this from the technicians'
dialog: lounge. You don't think they'll
dialog: mind, do you?
speaker_heading: DR.RESFIELD
dialog: You shouldn't be here, Director.
text: Dr. Resfield's eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall,

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: No, no. This is exactly where I
dialog: should be.
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD
dialog: You're under a lot of strain,
dialog: Director.
dialog: Witwer finds what he's looking for -- the continuous loop of
dialog: his murder by Anderson. "Call Now! Call Now!"
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: And tv's so good for that -- soothes
dialog: the mind.
text: Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a
text: bright smile. The scientist looks like he wants to run out
dialog: of the room.
text: Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the
text: Precogs. Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjusting
text: IV's and turning dials on the Precogs's organic helmets.
text: The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial.
dialog: But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too
dialog: weak for that.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: Bring me up to speed, Doc.
speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD

speaker_heading: WITWER

speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD

speaker_heading: DR. RESFIELD

scene_heading: INT. BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL
text: Rose looks like she's on fire. Anderson wets another towel,
text: wrings it over the sink. Lisa takes it, and wipes down Rose's
dialog: face and arms .
text: Rose's lips are moving soundlessly. Her eyes are shut tight.
text: She begins to writhe in bed.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Jesus Christ.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Come on, Rose.
text: ANDERSON LOOKS AT HIS WATCH
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: One hour. We hold it together for

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: She won't last an hour.
text: It suddenly looks much worse than that. Rose's body contorts

dialog: her.
text: Anderson reaches for her, wraps her in his arms, trying to
dialog: hold and comfort her.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Rose!
text: She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: He's killed him, Anderson!
text: Rose stiffens into a seizure posture, then her body goes
text: slack. Anderson eases her back on the bed. He stares at
dialog: her, stricken.
dialog: Her voice barely leaves her now
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't save my brother.
text: Anderson reels at her words.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Did he kill both of them, Rose?
dialog: Rose!
text: Rose manages to speak, one last time. Her whispered words
dialog: damn him.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Does it matter, Anderson?
text: Anderson rises. Looks down at Rose.
text: It matters. He starts to move, quickly.
text: Lisa takes hold of his arm.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: If you leave this room...
dialog: Anderson kisses her.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Then I'm a cop, just trying to do
dialog: hisjob.
text: He reaches for his duffel bag.
text: When the door closes behind him, Rose turns her head slightly
text: and looks. And then her eyes drift closed, as she goes to a
dialog: place deep within her own mind.
scene_heading: EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL - MOMENTS LATER
text: He passes by several cars on the street. But they're all
dialog: auto-drive, they won't do him any good.
text: So he smashes a store window within forty-five seconds a
text: city police transport zooms up, lights flashing. Two city
text: officers leap out of the transport. They approach the
dialog: smashed-in store window, weapons drawn. Which is a mistake.
text: Anderson rises into view behind them, and sonically blasts a
text: small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on.
text: As they trip and fall, he is already spraying them down with
dialog: BindFoam.
dialog: Their second mistake is they left the engine running to power
text: the bank of Nits -Tracker lights on the car's hood and roof.
text: Anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets
text: of The Sprawl, a beacon of light in the darkness.
speaker_heading: INT. THE LAB
text: The DIGITAL CLOCK races through time. Witwer reaches his

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dialog: And when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on
text: the floor in front of his chair is one of the Precog brothers.
text: A small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of
dialog: his skull.
text: The other Precog sits very still in his chair. He is still
dialog: connected to everything -- his helmet is in place, the TVs
text: drip into him. His eyes are open, and when Witwer moves,
dialog: the Precog's eyes follow him.
text: Witwer can feel them on him. He turns around.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Is he coming? No? Yes? Maybe?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think yes.

speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: Infallibly, immutably yes.

scene_heading: EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB

text: The officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right.
text: Then he looks hard. He grips his weapon tight, and swings
dialog: left. No one there, either.
text: ANDERSON drops him hard, from behind. The officer crumples
dialog: onto the cement.
text: But Anderson's not done with him. Anderson lifts him up,
text: struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance.
text: Anderson holds him upright in place. The man's head lolls
dialog: backward. Which is. Perfect for what Anderson needs to do.
text: Anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes.
text: He pulls up on the eyelids.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 108.
text: An IdentiScan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's
text: eyes. Access granted, the doors HISS open. Anderson enters
text: the building, dragging the officer with him.
speaker_heading: INT. THE LAB
text: Anderson enters the lab. The very building sickens him.
text: What he sees sickens him even more.
text: The remaining Precog sits strapped into his chair. Witwer
text: sits beside him in the other Precog chair, the dead brother
text: at his feet. Witwer wears the dead Precog's helmet. His
text: hand is in his lap, holding a gun.
text: He grins when Anderson appears. He takes off the helmet,
text: drops it on the floor.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: I figured, since I can see the future,
dialog: too, maybe I could get a little disc
dialog: action going.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just kidding.
text: Anderson stares at his old partner. Then he looks up at the
dialog: digital clock. Five-seventeen AM. Witwer looks too, then
dialog: turns back to Anderson.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: You find you been doing that a lot
dialog: this week? Looking at clocks?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Three minutes to go.
dialog: Anderson turns to the tv.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: There's never anything good on, you
dialog: know?
dialog: Now Witwer smiles.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: There. That's the old Paul.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: You're not the old Ed. You've lost
dialog: it.
text: Witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: You lost it. You went weak in the
dialog: knees, partner.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: I'm not your partner.
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 109.
text: Witwer looks at him sadly.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: The air went out of you when Frank
dialog: D'Ignazio killed himself.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: He was guilty. I accepted that.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: No you didn't. The doubts were
dialog: creeping in on you. The lab trying
dialog: to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm
dialog: pressuring you to expand ...
text: Witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining Precog
dialog: brother's cheek.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: Belief is the basis of the system.
dialog: It was your job to be the ultimate
dialog: believer.
text: Witwer is breathing hard. He lifts a hand and wipes the
dialog: sweat from his face.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: And when Frank died, you faltered.
dialog: I'm a cop, I see into the hearts of
dialog: men.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And the thing about you is, you
dialog: wouldn't have just walked away.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Never been my style.
text: Witwer gives him the flicker of a smile
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Precrime needs to grow. You would
dialog: have stood in its way. The Security
dialog: Panel wouldn't have understood that.
dialog: What you're capable of. What a
dialog: bulldog you are.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look what you've been doing to us
dialog: all week. Amazing. You're the best.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: So you took matters into your own hands.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: I understood the threat. I understood
speaker_heading: YOU
dialog: Anderson looks at the dead Precog
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: You killed a Precog. You ended the
dialog: system you wanted to protect.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Wrong. This lab will make more.
dialog: Believe it, Paul.
text: They look at the CLOCK. Five-nineteen.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Knowing the exact moment of your
dialog: death -it's made you crazy, Ed.
text: Witwer looks at the tv. The TV REALITY is almost in synch
dialog: with what is happening in the room.
text: Witwer lifts his gun -- and then realizes something is
dialog: terribly wrong.
text: Anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the
dialog: disc -- except there is a major difference.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: You sonofabitch!
dialog: Anderson lifts up both hands
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn't bring your gun!
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: That's right. No gun.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: You see?! That's exactly what I'm
dialog: talking about. You don't Believe!
text: Anderson just looks at Witwer, raging at him.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: The system is infallible.
dialog: ANDERSON Doesn't Seem to be Witwer reaches behind him and
text: pulls a second gun from out of his belt.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess that's why I've always carried
dialog: two.
text: He tosses the gun to Anderson. It clatters at Anderson's
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: You can't have it both ways. You
dialog: don't want to die. That's why you
dialog: lured me here -- to kill me first.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But it you don't diet the system is
dialog: flawed, and you couldn't live with
dialog: that.
dialog: Witwer SHOOTS him once, in the right thigh. Anderson cries
text: out, falls to the concrete floor.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Pick it up
text: Anderson speaks through his teeth ANDERSON It doesn't happen.
text: Witwer looks frantically at the tv, at the clock.
text: He reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back IV
text: feeding into the Precog's main line. A thick, yellow fluid
text: begins to flow toward the Precog's jugular vein.
speaker_heading: WITWER (CONT'D)
dialog: You're killing him, partner.
dialog: And what choice, finally, does Anderson have? He reaches
dialog: for the gun.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON
dialog: Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains
dialog: his gun on Anderson. Anderson trains
dialog: his gun on Witwer.
speaker_heading: ANDERSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Ed ...
text: Witwer lowers his gun. And stands there between Anderson
dialog: and the doomed Precog.
text: The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precog's jugular.
text: Anderson shoots Witwer, once in the heart. Witwer is thrown
text: back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock.
text: Anderson drags himself to the Precog, and rips the yellow IV
text: out of the main line. The yellow drips onto the floor,
dialog: mingling with Witwer's red.
text: Anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him. Witwer
text: whispers something, and Anderson leans close to hear him.
speaker_heading: WITWER
dialog: Now do you believe?
text: Anderson pulls away from Witwer, and lets him take his last
dialog: breaths alone.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: DARKNESS
text: And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
dialog: beautifully proportioned FACE.
text: It is Rose's face. The camera pulls back and we see that
text: she is lying on a grassy hillside. Her brother is lying
dialog: beside her.
text: They are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with
dialog: stars.
text: Rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to
dialog: her brother.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: James. Can you guess what I'm
dialog: thinking?
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: (beat)
dialog: NO.
text: James smiles. And then, after a long moment, so does Rose.
speaker_heading: THE END
