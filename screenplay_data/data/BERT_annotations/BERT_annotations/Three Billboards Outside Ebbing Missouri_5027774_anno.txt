scene_heading: EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - DAY 1
text: MILDRED HAYES, a woman in her early 50's, driving along a
text: country road, passes an old billboard, roadside. Whatever
text: advert was on it is long since faded and torn. MILDRED drives
text: on, to a second billboard a few hundred feet along the road.
text: She notices this one a little more, though its old adverts
text: are equally ramshackle. She slows to a stop.
text: After looking up at the billboard a while, she slowly
text: reverses and stops at the first, then at all three,
text: stretching away to the quiet horizon.
text: Makes a mental note of “EBBING BILLBOARD ADVERTISING”, then
text: drives on again, leaving the three old billboards alone like
text: tombstones on the dusty road.
scene_heading: INT. WELBY’S OFFICE - EBBING ADVERTISING - DAY 2
text: RED WELBY’s office, window looking onto MAIN STREET and the
text: town's POLICE STATION. RED, a cool-looking young guy,
text: pretends to read a Penguin Classic as he observes the office
text: hottie, PAMELA, pass in a cute dress. MILDRED strides on in.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: You Red Welby?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Yes, ma'am. How may I..
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: They said those three billboards out on
dialog: Drinkwater Road, you're in charge of
dialog: renting them out, that right?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: I didn’t know we had any billboards out
dialog: on... Where is Drinkwater Road?
speaker_heading: MILDRED
text: Road out past the Sizemore turn-off no-
text: one uses since the highway got put in.
text: RED checks a file. MILDRED observes a beetle on its back on
text: the windowsill, trying to right itself.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: You're right. Got three billboards out
dialog: there. Nobody's put nothing up out
dialog: there since... 1986. That was
dialog: ‘Huggies’.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: How much to rent out all three of ‘em
dialog: the year?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: The year? You wanna pay for three
text: billboards on a road no-one goes down
dialog: unless they got lost or they’re
dialog: retards, for a year?
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Quick, ain’t ya, Welby?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: Well... since what I say goes these
dialog: days down at the Ebbing Advertising
dialog: Desk, I’m gonna strike you a real good
dialog: deal’on those billboards, now, what was
dialog: it you said your name was, Mrs...?
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: What's the law on what ya can and can’t
dialog: say on a billboard? I assume it’s ya
dialog: can’t say nothing defamatory, and ya
dialog: can’t say, ‘Fuck’ ‘Piss’ or ‘Cunt’.
dialog: That right?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Or... Anus.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Well I think I'll be alright then.
dialog: Here’s five thousand for the first
dialog: month. I assume that'll cover it.
text: She plonks down five thousand dollars cash.
speaker_heading: MILDRED (CONT'D)
dialog: And here’s what the billboards oughta
dialog: say.
text: She hands him three index cards, then moves to the window. He
text: reads the first, the second, the third. Stunned.
speaker_heading: MILDRED (CONT'D)
dialog: Why don’t ya draw up a little contract
dialog: betwixt us while you're at it, make
dialog: sure no-one rents them billboards out.
dialog: from under me?
text: Welby looks up at her sadly.
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: I guess you're Angela Hayes’ mother.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: That’s right, I’m Angela Hayes’ mother.
text: MILDRED, at window, gently sets the beetle back upright. It
text: waddles off happily. Behind it, the U.S flag flutters above
text: the police station, as a couple of laughing COPS enter it.
speaker_heading: MILDRED (CONT'D)
dialog: Name's Mildred. How long before you've
dialog: got ‘em put up?
speaker_heading: RED
dialog: (checking calendar)
dialog: Oh, shall we say by... Easter Sunday?
text: MILDRED stares out at the police station.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: That'd be perfect.
scene_heading: EXT. COP CAR DRIVING BILLBOARD ROAD - NIGHT 3
text: OFFICER DIXON, 35, drives up the billboard road and
text: approaches, FROM BEHIND, the THIRD billboard. Two LATINO
text: WORKMEN work on it, buckets and squeegees. As he passes he
text: looks up at the posters on it, double-takes, SCREECHES to a
dialog: halt.
text: The billboard reads, in large, stark letters “HOW COME, CHIEF
scene_heading: WILLOUGHBY?”.
speaker_heading: DIXON

speaker_heading: LATINO

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Listen, I better start getting some
dialog: straight answers outta you Mexican sons
dialog: of bitches...
text: The 2ND LATINO has pointed to the distant SECOND billboard,
text: making an odd little gesture, and DIXON looks over...
speaker_heading: DIXON’S POV:
dialog: 4.
text: The back of the second billboard, and the BLACK

dialog: DIXON sighs,

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: I dunno, do ya?
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Yeah. Yeah, I do.
text: on the ground, looks at him with disdain. DIXON
text: a vicious edge between them.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: I could arrest you right now, if I
dialog: wanted to.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: For... emptying out your bucket there.
dialog: It’s against the... being bad against
dialog: the environment laws.
speaker_heading: JEROME
dialog: Well, before you do that, Officer
dialog: Dixon, why don’t you go have yourself a
text: look at that first billboard over
dialog: there, and then we can have ourself a
dialog: talk about the motherfucking
dialog: environment. How about that?
dialog: 
text: DIXON looks at the distant FIRST BILLBOARD, standing all
text: alone, back to us, the dark sky behind it. DIXON sighs,
text: starts his car, pulls away.
text: We go with him, staying on his face, as he comes to the FIRST
text: BILLBOARD and slowly stops in front of it. His face falls.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Fuck me.
text: He takes out his cellphone, and presses “WILLOUGHBY (HOME)”.

speaker_heading: RED

scene_heading: WILLOUGHBY, DESK SERGEANT and DIXON.
speaker_heading: DIXON

speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: No crime has been committed here.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Defamation of character ain’t a crime?
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: It isn’t defamation if she’s simply
text: asking a question.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: What are you, an idiot?
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: Don’t call me an idiot, Dixon.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: I didn’t call you an idiot. I asked if
dialog: you was an idiot. It was a question.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY

speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY

speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT

speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Well, my daughter, Angela, she got

dialog: seven months ago, on this self-same
dialog: stretch o’ road here, unfortunately,
dialog: and, to me... I mean, to me, it seems
dialog: like the local police department is too
dialog: busy goin’ round torturing black folks

scene_heading: EXT. MILDRED’S GARDEN - DAY 18
text: MILDRED sitting on a creaky swing-set, WILLOUGHBY with hat in

speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: I'd do anything to catch the guy who

dialog: arrested, and when the DNA don’t match
dialog: any other crime nationwide, and when
dialog: there wasn’t a single eyewitness from
dialog: the time she left your house to the

dialog: there ain’t too much more that we can
dialog: do, except...
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Could pull blood from every man and boy
dialog: in this town, over the age of eight.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: There's civil rights laws prevents
dialog: that, Mrs Hayes, and what if he was
dialog: just passing thru town...
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Pull blood from ever’ man in the
dialog: country, then.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: And what if he was just passing thru
dialog: the country?
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: If it was me, I'd start up a database,
dialog: every male baby what’s born, stick ‘em
dialog: on it, cross-reference it, and as soon
dialog: as they done something wrong, make a
dialog: hundred percent certain it was a
dialog: correct match, then kill ‘em.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Yeah, well, there’s definitely civil
dialog: rights laws prevents that.
text: He sits on the swing beside her, the billboards stretching
text: out down the hill in front of them.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m doing everything I can to track him
dialog: down, Mrs Hayes. I don’t think those
dialog: billboards is very fair.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: The time it’s took you to come out here
text: whining like a bitch, Willoughby, some
dialog: other poor girl's probably being
dialog: butchered right now, but it’s good

speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: There's something else, Mildred.

speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: I know it.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Huh?

speaker_heading: MILDRED

speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: They kill ‘em! Which, it might surprise

speaker_heading: RED
dialog: I’m not sure if they do kill faggots

speaker_heading: RED

speaker_heading: DIXON

speaker_heading: MILDRED

scene_heading: FATHER MONTGOMERY
dialog: I know it’s been hard for you, Mildred,
dialog: this past year. We all do. The whole

dialog: town also knows what kind of a man

speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Took a poll, did ya, Father?
scene_heading: FATHER MONTGOMERY
dialog: If you hadn't stopped coming to church,

dialog: about this.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: ¥/know what I was thinking about,

text: running with ‘em, and down the block
dialog: from you one night, unbeknownst to you,

dialog: Bloods, shoot up a place, or stab a

dialog: nothing about it, even though you
dialog: may’ve just been standing on a

dialog: those new laws said you are still
dialog: culpable. You are still culpable, by
dialog: the very act of joining those Crips, or
dialog: those Bloods, in the first place. Which
dialog: got me thinking, Father, that whole
dialog: type of situation is kinda similar to
dialog: you Church boys, ain’t it? You've got
dialog: your colors, you've got your clubhouse,
dialog: you're, for want of a better word, a
dialog: gang. And if you're upstairs smoking a
text: pipe and reading a bible while one of
dialog: your fellow gang members is downstairs
dialog: fucking an altar boy then, Father, just
dialog: like the Crips, and just like the
dialog: Bloods, you're culpable. Cos you joined
dialog: the gang, man. And I don’t care if you
dialog: never did shit or never saw shit or
dialog: never heard shit. You joined the gang.
dialog: You’re culpable. And when a person is
dialog: culpable to altar-boy-fucking, or any-
dialog: kinda-boy-fucking, I know you guys
dialog: didn’t really narrow it down, then they
dialog: kinda forfeit the right to come into my
dialog: house and say a word about me, or my

dialog: and how much I’ve always loved you.
dialog: This one just covers tonight, and, more
dialog: importantly, today. Tonight I have gone
dialog: out to the horses to end it. I cannot
dialog: say sorry for the act itself, although
dialog: I know that for a short time you will
dialog: be angry at me or even hate me for it.
dialog: Please don’t. This is not a case of “I
dialog: came in this world alone, and I’m going
dialog: out of it alone” or anything dumb like
dialog: that. I did not come in this world
dialog: alone, my mom was there, and I am not.
dialog: going out of it alone, cos you are
text: there, drunk on the couch, making Oscar
dialog: Wilde’ cock jokes. No. This is a case,
dialog: in some senses, of bravery. Not the
dialog: bravery of facing a bullet down; the
dialog: next few months of pain would be far
dialog: harder than that small flash. No, it’s
dialog: the bravery of weighing up the next few
dialog: months of still being with you, still
dialog: waking up with you, of playing with the
dialog: kids, against the next few months of
dialog: seeing in your eyes how much my pain is
dialog: killing you; how my weakened body as it
dialog: ebbs away and you tend to it are your
dialog: final and lasting memories of me. I
dialog: won't have that. Your final memories of
dialog: me will be us at the riverside, and
dialog: that dumb fishing game (which I think
dialog: they cheated at), and me inside of you,
dialog: and you on top of me, and barely a
text: fleeting thought of the darkness yet to
dialog: come. That was the best, Anne. A whole
dialog: day of not thinking about it. Dwell on
dialog: this day, baby, cos it was the best day

speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE
dialog: Hard of reading, no, no. That’s good,

dialog: “hard of hearing”, but it’s actually
dialog: it's “hard of reading’, it’s like a

speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE
dialog: Uh, I've been sent down to uh, take

speaker_heading: DIXON

speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: I can’t find my badge. No, seriously.

speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE

speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: You know me?
scene_heading: CROP-HAIRED GUY

scene_heading: CROP-HAIRED GUY

speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: What the Hell was it you come in here
dialog: for?
scene_heading: CROP-HAIRED GUY
dialog: What did I come in here for? Well,
dialog: maybe I’m a good friend of
dialog: Willoughby’s, how about that?
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Are you?
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: CROP-HAIRED GUY
dialog: Or, y'know... maybe I was a friend of

dialog: that?
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Were you?
speaker_heading: CROP-HAIRED MAN
dialog: or, uh, y'know, maybe I was the guy who

speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Were you?
scene_heading: CROP-HAIRED GUY

speaker_heading: CROP-HAIRED GUY (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: MILDRED

scene_heading: CROP-HAIRED GUY

speaker_heading: ANNE

speaker_heading: MILDRED

speaker_heading: ANNE

speaker_heading: MILDRED

speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: My husband left this for you before he

speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: I’m sorry, Mrs Willoughby...
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Are you? Are you really?
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Of course...
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: Surely it’s the perfect ending for you,
dialog: isn’t it? It’s proof that they've been
dialog: successful, these billboards of yours,
dialog: isn’t it, a dead policeman? It’s
dialog: quantifiable now.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Are you blaming this on me?
speaker_heading: ANNE
dialog: No, I’m not blaming this on you. I just
dialog: came to give you the letter. Now, my
text: two little girls are out in the car, so
dialog: I'd better not stay and chat. I’m not
dialog: sure what we’re going to do for the
dialog: rest of the day. It’s hard to know what

text: MILDRED rests her head on the glass door a second, the broken

text: starts reading, as dusk falls on the street outside.
speaker_heading: WILLOUGHBY
dialog: Dear Mildred, Dead Man Willoughby here.
dialog: Firstly I wanted to apologise for dying

dialog: thing is wrapped up thru sheer
dialog: stupidity. I hope that might be true
dialog: for Angela, I really do. Second, I
dialog: gotta admit, Mildred, the billboards
dialog: were a great fucking idea. They were
text: like a chess move. And although they
dialog: had absolutely nothing to do with my
dialog: dying, I’m sure that everyone in town
dialog: will assume that they did, which is
dialog: why, for Willoughby’s counter-move, I
dialog: decided to pay the next month’s rent on
dialog: ‘em. I thought it’d be funny, you
dialog: having to defend ‘em a whole nuther
dialog: month after they’ve stuck me in the

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: You're shitting me. Is Welby okay?

text: Billboard Road and suddenly sees...
speaker_heading: MILDRED (CONT'D)
dialog: You're shitting me!
text: ...ALL THREE OF THE BILLBOARDS ARE ON FIRE. MILDRED speeds
dialog: towards them...
scene_heading: EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - NIGHT 72
text: We speed towards the fiery billboards; the third totally

speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Go get the one from the house!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Shouldn’t I call the fire department?
speaker_heading: MILDRED

dialog: (quietly)

dialog: scumbags.
text: ...and finally gets the first billboard out, then sprints all
dialog: the way to the second, starts in on that. It’s harder this
text: time - the flames already halfway up.
text: She gets an idea, concentrates all her efforts on the left
text: side post alone and, as it starts going out, she starts
text: climbing up it, putting out the fire bit by bit as she goes.
dialog: 73
dialog: 58.
text: Finally, all the left hand post is out and, though her hands
text: are burnt, she gets to the top of the billboard and starts
text: walking along it, spraying down along its length.
text: This starts to work, flames edging back, until tsss tsss, the
text: extinguisher runs out of stuff. She tosses it violently at
text: the flames and stays standing there, staring at them, as the
text: flames slowly start to rise towards her again.
text: Suddenly, ROBBIE pulls up, jumps out of the car and starts in
text: on the flames below her.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: What the hell are you doing, Mom?!
text: The flames start to come under control as MILDRED climbs
text: back down. ROBBIE has the second billboard out by the time

text: starts marching off towards it...
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Come on...
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Leave it, Ma. It’s too late.
text: MILDRED storms back and tries to grab the extinguisher off

text: terribly, but she keeps trying.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Mom, leave it, please!
text: PAUSE. MILDRED makes one final effort. This time ROBBIE lets

scene_heading: EXT. BILLBOARD ROAD - NIGHT 73

text: Across the street, MILDRED comes out of the WELBY building

dialog: he might be the guy. I got his DNA. I
dialog: got a lot of it, actually. They’re
dialog: making the checks as we speak.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: He's in jail?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: No, but he ain’t gonna be hard to find.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Why do you think he’s the guy?
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: I heard him talking about something
dialog: that he did to a girl in the middle of
dialog: last year. I couldn’t hear all of it,
dialog: but it sounded a lot like what happened
dialog: to Angela. Then he beat the crap outta
dialog: me. But cos of that I got a bunch of
dialog: his DNA. So I wanted to let you know
dialog: sooner rather than later. I didn’t want
dialog: you to give up hope, y'know?
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: I’ve been trying not to.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Well, all you can do is try, as my
dialog: Momma says. Not so much about hope as
dialog: about... well, I didn’t used to be very
dialog: good at English at school, so it was
dialog: more “All you can do is try... to not
dialog: be so crap at English.” Cos you need
dialog: English, really, if you wanna be a cop.
dialog: If you wanna be anything, really.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: unless you live in Mexico or something.
dialog: But who wants that?
text: He gets up to go.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: Hey Dixon?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Thanks.
text: He smiles, and she watches him drive away, out past the
text: billboards. She sits there a while, thinking.

speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE
dialog: You did good, Jason. You did real good.
dialog: But he wasn’t the guy.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE
dialog: There was no match to the DNA, no
dialog: matches to any other crimes of this
dialog: nature, to any crimes at all, in fact.
dialog: And his record is clean. Maybe he was
dialog: just bragging.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: He wasn’t just bragging.
speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE
dialog: Well, that’s as may be. But at the time
dialog: of Angela’s death he wasn’t even in the
dialog: country.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Where was he?
speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE
dialog: But I’ve seen his records of entry and
dialog: exit to the States, and I’ve spoken to
dialog: his Commanding Officer. He wasn’t in
dialog: the country, Dixon. He ain’t our guy.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: He might not be our guy, but he still
dialog: done something shitty.
speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE
dialog: Not in Missouri he didn’t.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Where was he?
speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE
dialog: That's classified information.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: Come on, man.

dialog: 129
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE
dialog: If the guy’s got a Commanding Officer,
dialog: and if the guy got back to the country
dialog: nine months ago, and if the country
dialog: where he was is classified, which
dialog: country do you think he was in?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I’ll give you a clue. It was sandy.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: That doesn’t really narrow it down.
speaker_heading: ABERCROMBIE
dialog: All you need to know is, he didn’t do
dialog: nothing to Angela Hayes. So we’re gonna
dialog: keep looking. Alright?
text: Pause. DIXON takes out his badge, shows it to ABERCROMBIE.
speaker_heading: DIXON
dialog: I found my badge after all.
text: DIXON looks at it a few seconds, then slides it across the
text: table to ABERCROMBIE, and leaves.

speaker_heading: MILDRED

speaker_heading: DIXON (0.S.)
dialog: He, um, he wasn’t even in the country
dialog: when it happened. So, whatever he did,
dialog: he didn’t do it round here.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I’m sorry I got your hopes up.
speaker_heading: MILDRED
dialog: It's alright. At least I had a day of
