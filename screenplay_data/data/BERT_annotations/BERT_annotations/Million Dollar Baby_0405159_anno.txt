scene_heading: INT. L.A. BOXING ARENA -- NIGHT
text: BIG WILLIE LITTLE sits sweating on his stool in the corner
dialog: of the ring. He's African-American, a heavyweight, and he's
text: cut bad under the right eye. His CUT MAN jabs coagulant
text: into the wound; looks up to the manager standing over him.
speaker_heading: CUT MAN
dialog: I can't stop it.
text: The manager, FRANKIE DUNN, pushes him aside.
speaker_heading: FRANKIE
dialog: Get outta the building, you useless
dialog: tit.
text: Frankie drops to one knee and we see his face. It's a face
dialog: that could only have been cast by generations of potato-
text: eaters, the kind of face that survives famines and frustrates
dialog: invaders. Look deep into his eyes and you can see this man
text: has been knocked to his knees, but he's always come up before
text: the count. Always will. Frankie picks up the kit and goes
text: to work on Big Willie. We're mesmerized by Frankie's hands.
text: It's like watching a top surgeon going for a world speed
dialog: record.
speaker_heading: SCRAP V.O.
dialog: When I met him he was already the
dialog: best cut man in the business. Started
dialog: training and managing in the 66's,
dialog: but he never lost his gift.
text: Frankie cleans and flushes the wound with an adrenaline
text: solution, uses his thumbs to work the blood away from the
text: gash and packs it with a coagulant-rich salve.
speaker_heading: BIG WILLIE

speaker_heading: SCRAP V.O. (CONT'D)
dialog: Cut's too wide, too close to the
dialog: bone, maybe you got a severed vein...
text: Big Willie, unwilling to follow Frankie's instructions, keeps
