speaker_heading: TONI ERDMANN
dialog: Written by Maren Ade
scene_heading: EXT. - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY
text: A house with a wild garden ona tranquil suburban street. It sits there quietly; The
text: only movement appears to come from behind a window. We hear a delivery truck
text: pull up. Its sliding door opens and closes. A MAILMAN walks into shot carrying a
text: package and searches for the doorbell. He finds it amongst some ivy and rings.
text: WINFRIED, a man in his mid-60s with wavy gray hair, an unkempt beard and a pair
text: of colorful reading glasses, opens the door.
speaker_heading: MAILMAN
dialog: Good morning. Package.
text: The mailman starts typing something on a modern electronic signature device.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Wait a moment... No idea what my brother’s been
dialog: ordering again.
text: Winfried steps a couple of meters into the house and calls to someone. The mailman
dialog: waits professionally.
speaker_heading: WINERIED (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: Toni?! Did you order something?
text: He returns to the mailman.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: My brother just got released from prison. He
dialog: does whatever he wants.
speaker_heading: MAILMAN
dialog: Oh dear.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: He was locked up for mail bombs. Yesterday, he
dialog: ate a whole can of dog food. OK, just a moment,
dialog: please.
text: Winfried disappears again, leaving the mailman standing there. He diligently carries
text: on holding the package.
speaker_heading: WINERIED (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: (suddenly shouting)
dialog: Toni, get your ass out of the hammock right now!
speaker_heading: TONI(0.S.)
dialog: I’m still having breakfast.
speaker_heading: WINERIED (0.S.)
dialog: Keep this up and I’ll throw you out. Did you
dialog: order something from Orion again?
speaker_heading: TONI(0.S.)
dialog: No, I didn’t. Don’t be so mean to me.
text: Aman appears. Apart from a few distinctive teeth, he looks uncannily similar to
text: Winfried. He’s wearing a black bathrobe and dark sunglasses. He voice has changed
text: and he mumbles when he speaks. The mailman quickly hands him the package.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: What my brother said about me isn’t true. I’ve
dialog: never ordered any erotic products.
text: The mailman holds the device out so Toni can sign it.
speaker_heading: MAILMAN
dialog: I don’t care what’s in it.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: It’s better that way.
text: Toni signs using capital letters. A pair of handcuffs dangles from his wrist and the
text: mailman notices them with bemusement. He briefly puts his ear to the package.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks. Now I’m really looking forward to
text: defusing it.
text: In the background, by the garden fence, LUKAS appears: He’s a pale teenager (16)
text: with tight-fitting black jeans and drooping shoulders. Winfried quickly takes off his
text: sunglasses and removes a set of false teeth from his mouth and sticks them in his
text: pocket. He can’t help but laugh.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Hey, Lukas...
text: Winfried looks at the mailman, who also laughs with bewilderment. It’s not clear
text: whether Winfried’s act might have convinced him for a moment, after all. Lukas still
text: stands some distance away, unsure whether he’s allowed to come closer.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: (to mailman)
dialog: No offense meant. They were both me. It was
dialog: obvious, right?
text: Winfried fishes out a five-euro bill and gives the mailman a quick pat on the
text: shoulder. An electronic beeping sound emanates from Winfried’s body.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t worry. That’s just my blood pressure
dialog: monitor.
text: Winfried finally takes the package from the mailman.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: You're the bravest one yet.
dialog: (to Lukas)
dialog: I'll be right there...
text: The mailman leaves and Winfried also disappears.
scene_heading: INT. - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - GARDEN - DAY
text: In the living room, Winfried hastily takes off his bathrobe. Several plastic objects
text: and cables are attached to his body. They look like an explosive belt. He buttons his
text: shirt and puts down the package. The device on his body is still beeping. An old dog
text: (WILLI) hauls himself up off the floor and lies down again at a safe distance. The
text: dog’s breathing is labored and fluid rattles in his lungs.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Come in...
text: Lukas enters the living room. Winfried opens the package and pulls out a new spray
text: gun attachment for his garden hose.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: Our lesson is tomorrow, right?
speaker_heading: LUKAS
dialog: Yes, but I, | wanted to tell you that, um... Well, I
dialog: want to quit taking piano lessons.
text: For a moment, neither speaks.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: LUKAS
dialog: I just don’t have enough time anymore.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: We saw this coming a bit, right?
speaker_heading: LUKAS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: And what do I do with the piano now? I bought it
dialog: just for you.
text: Lukas freezes for a moment.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: Just kidding. But you have to tell your mother.
dialog: I’m not doing it.
text: Lukas nods. The dog can be heard wheezing in the garden.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: That's just the dog.
text: Winfried walks into the garden to fetch his beer. He bends down to Willi again. He
text: quickly takes a plate of sausage from the table and places it front of the dog. Willi
text: turns his head away. Winfried grabs his beer and walks back to Lukas.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you drink beer already?
speaker_heading: LUKAS
dialog: Ah, yeah, sure.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: My internet’s acting up. That ball was there
dialog: again.
text: Lukas bends over the laptop on the table.
speaker_heading: LUKAS
dialog: Yeah, it’s frozen.
scene_heading: INT. - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Winfried and Lukas still sit in the living room in front of the laptop, sharing a beer.
text: Winfried’s face is painted white with dark circles around his eyes that break out into
text: jagged points. Face paints lie on the table. On the computer screen we see pictures of
dialog: people painted like the death.
speaker_heading: LUKAS
dialog: I'd put some blood there, too.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: OK.
text: Winfried looks into a small hand mirror and applies a little more blood to the corner
text: of his mouth.
speaker_heading: LUKAS
dialog: That looks cool. Like the Joker.
text: Winfried looks into his little hand mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. - OUTSIDE WINFRIED’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Lukas leaves Winfried’s house carrying a dog pillow and a grocery bag. He pauses
text: and waits for Winfried. Winfried emerges from the house with Willi in his arms, his
text: face painted like a zombie: large black circles around his eyes, a black “grin” around
text: his mouth and a smear of fake blood. He closes the front door and follows Lukas
text: down the walkway. In the distance, an elderly couple walks towards Winfried and
text: looks at him with bemusement.
scene_heading: EXT. - ANNEGRET’S HOUSE - GARDEN - TERRACE - DAY
text: Winfried walks through a landscaped garden. He slowly pulls Willi up some steps
text: while also lugging the basket and shopping bags. Inside the house, ANNEGRET, a
text: very old woman, sits in her living room in front of the TV. Winfried gives a warning
text: knock on the glass veranda doors and holds a “Frau im Spiegel - Woman in the
text: Mirror” magazine in front of his face. Its cover depicts German TV host Thomas
text: Gottschalk. Winfried slowly lowers the magazine. Annegret, his mother, is not at all
text: shocked to see his painted face. She slowly pushes her walking frame to the door.
scene_heading: INT. - ANNEGRET’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Annegret greets Willi, who drags himself inside with great effort and lies down ona
dialog: Persian rug.
speaker_heading: ANNEGRET
dialog: Why don’t you put him to sleep? He’s only
dialog: suffering.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I’m not putting you to sleep, either.
text: Annegret deliberately ignores Winfried’s costume. She begins imperiously
text: examining the groceries and checking them against her shopping list. It takes her a
text: long time to do anything, but she doesn’t want help. We hear the sound of a radio
text: coming from the bedroom.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: Is Mrs. Radica still here?
text: Annegret doesn’t answer. She sullenly inspects a couple of ready-made tartes
dialog: flambées.
speaker_heading: WINERIED (CONT'D)
dialog: I brought you these tartes flambées. They’re
dialog: really good. You just have to warm them up.
speaker_heading: ANNEGRET
dialog: You eat these?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: ANNEGRET
dialog: Then take them with you.
text: Winfried’s gaze drifts to the table which Annegret has already set for two people.
speaker_heading: ANNEGRET (CONT’D)
dialog: Now sit down.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Ihave to go soon.
text: Winfried quickly sits down on the edge of a corner bench and puts a slice of sausage
text: onto a piece of bread.
speaker_heading: ANNEGRET
dialog: The Dombrechts are cutting your hedges
dialog: tomorrow. You're blocking all their sun.
text: Winfried has to stifle his anger.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: That's fine. My new hose attachment has a range
dialog: of 30 meters, so I’ll be able to shoot right into
dialog: their living room.
speaker_heading: ANNEGRET
dialog: There’s no need to joke about it.
text: Winfried’s blood pressure monitor beeps quietly and inflates on his upper arm.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I’m glad that thing’s taking a measurement now.
dialog: It ascertains which topics upset me most. Then
dialog: Dombrowski can tell me precisely what I need to
dialog: eliminate from my life.
speaker_heading: ANNEGRET
dialog: You'll soon be rid of me.
text: Winfried takes another bite of his sandwich and looks at her.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I might bring Ines tomorrow. Apparently she’s
dialog: traveling through.
speaker_heading: ANNEGRET
dialog: Oh, she’s here...?
text: Winfried’s mother’s face briefly brightens up at the good news.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Yeah. I have to go.
text: Annegret shrugs. Winfried peels himself out of the corner. He walks into a back
text: room, past the bathroom which MRS. RADICA, a domestic maid of Eastern European
text: appearance, is cleaning.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't be frightened...
speaker_heading: MRS. RADICA
dialog: Oh, my...
text: Mrs. Radica laughs. Winfried gives her a friendly handshake. Annegret follows him
text: with her walking frame so she can keep an eye on what he’s doing. Winfried takes a
text: hat from a closet.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Can I borrow this?
text: Annegret shrugs in agreement.
speaker_heading: ANNEGRET
dialog: And what's with the getup?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: So you are interested, after all? I’ve taken on a
dialog: side job in an old people’s home. 50 euros per
text: death. Most of them won't fight back.
text: Annegret shakes her head. Winfried leans down towards Willi, who has hauled
text: himself after him.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: Thanks for taking him. I’ll just pick him up later...
scene_heading: INT. - SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: Winfried waits with a large group of JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS in the
text: entrance area of a school. They’re standing outside a door leading to the auditorium.
text: The children all have their faces painted like Death and they’re making an effort to
text: stand quietly. Winfried has a guitar slung around him. A COLLEAGUE is helping him
text: look after the children. She laughs quietly.
speaker_heading: COLLEAGUE
text: It is a little macabre.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: We can’t change it now...
text: From the auditorium, someone can be indistinctly heard bringing their speech to a
text: close, then the large audience applauds. The students prematurely push forward
text: into a darkened backstage area. A few of them are carrying instruments. They
text: collide with the art club as it leaves the stage with a huge, long artwork that requires
text: several students to carry it. A crush ensues. One of the “young Deaths” gets pushed
text: over and fights back.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: Slowly, slowly... Arne, get up.
text: From outside, we hear as the music club’s performance is announced.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: OK guys, now focus. Everyone’s sad...
text: The students let their shoulders droop and amble very sadly onto the stage.
text: Winfried checks that every last student is there. A few members of the audience
text: burst out laughing. Winfried is the last person to take to the stage. He gives a
text: command and the students make a voodoo-like racket, then chant...
speaker_heading: STUDENTS
dialog: (chanting in unison)
dialog: We're dead sad that you're leaving, Mr.
dialog: Dudinger!
text: In the packed auditorium, people laugh bemusedly. A MANN in the front row, clearly
text: the person being bid farewell, isn’t sure how to take it. Winfried gives another
text: command and starts playing a tune on his guitar. A few students join in on their
text: instruments. The students start singing an adapted version of Hannes Wader’s song,
text: “Day to Day”. We look into their faces, which are full of concentration.
scene_heading: INT. - SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Winfried walks hurriedly through the empty high school holding his school key in
text: his hand.
scene_heading: INT. - WINFRIED’S CAR - STREET BY RENATE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Winfried has parked his VW Passat in front of a fancy new-build house in a hillside
text: location. He glances into the mirror and looks for a tissue, but he can’t find one. He
text: puts on his hat and gets out of the car.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. - RENATE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Winfried fishes a bottle of red wine from a canvas grocery bag. With his colorful
text: reading glasses hanging around his neck, he’s now only a half-Death. At the front
text: door, he hitches up his pants and takes a breath. He plucks up the courage to ring
text: the bell. RENATE (60) opens the door.
speaker_heading: RENAT
dialog: My God... what's this?
dialog: m
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Sorry. I have an upset stomach.
text: She lets him in. GERHARD appears in the background, alarmed by Renate’s scream.
speaker_heading: GERHARD
dialog: What are you up to? I was about to get my gun.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Do you have a gun?
speaker_heading: GERHARD
dialog: Of course I have a gun.
speaker_heading: RENAT
dialog: Were you dressed like that at school?
dialog: m
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: No, I’m working part-time at the old people’s
dialog: home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERHARD
dialog: Interesting.
text: Winfried greets the other guests: OLIVER, mid-30s, clearly Gerhard’s son, his
text: pregnant girlfriend BABETTE, whom Winfried hasn’t met before, and BARBEL, an
text: old friend of Renate’s. Winfried whips out his false teeth from his jacket pocket and
text: puts them in his mouth.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Hello, Barbel.
text: Barbel laughs.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Winfried, hi...
text: Winfried puts the teeth away again.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Congratulations. I’m pleased you're going to be
dialog: parents. When is it due?
speaker_heading: BABETTE
dialog: Not until October.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (murmuring)
dialog: Stick together.
speaker_heading: GERHARD
dialog: Red, white or beer?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Whatever you're having... Isn’t she here yet?
text: Winfried looks around for Ines.
speaker_heading: RENAT
text: Still on the phone.
dialog: m
text: Winfried sits down ona chair while he waits.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (to Renate)
dialog: Her flight was OK?
speaker_heading: RENAT
dialog: Yeah, she was tired.
dialog: m
text: Renate goes to fetch another plate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GERHARD
dialog: But apparently things went really well in
dialog: Shanghai.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Isn’t she in Bucharest anymore?
speaker_heading: GERHARD
dialog: Sure, but she had meetings there. She wants to
dialog: go there next.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Oh, right...
speaker_heading: GERHARD
dialog: Yes, it all went really well. They’re opening a new
dialog: branch there. So she was meeting managers from
dialog: Siemens. New clients and executives, too.
text: Renate returns and puts a plate down in front of Winfried.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Oh, right.
speaker_heading: GERHARD
dialog: It’s incredible the heavyweights she’s in the ring
dialog: with.
text: Winfried notices some gifts lying on the table.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Whose birthday is it?
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: We decided to celebrate early.
text: Winfried sits back in surprise.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED CONRADI
dialog: Oh, come on! You should’ve let me know that.
text: A woman (INES) approaches the patio door, talking on her cellphone. She rolls her
text: eyes by way of apology for the phone call. She is wearing a crisp shirt and blazer.
text: Winfried briefly reaches towards Gerhard’s neck and pretends to strangle him. Ines
dialog: smiles.
speaker_heading: BARBEL
dialog: And in Bucharest, what... what’s she doing there?
speaker_heading: GERHARD
dialog: She’s in the oil business.
text: Barbel nods knowingly but doesn’t dare ask any more questions.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: She’s only advising an oil company. She’s still a
dialog: business consultant.
speaker_heading: BARBEL
dialog: Oh, right.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Ihave to write that down now, too.
text: Ines has finished her phone call and enters the room. She comes over to say hello to
dialog: Winfried.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: You guys talking business again? Hello, Dad...
text: They hug awkwardly because of Winfried’s face-paint. Winfried rubs her neck.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Hello... spaghetti. How’s it going?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Really good, actually.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I didn’t know you were celebrating your birthday
dialog: already. I have a meeting in Bucharest next week,
dialog: so I'll bring you your present then.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Sure, please do that. Any time. Just ring my bell...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Yeah, you might be surprised.
text: They sit down.
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: (to Ines)
dialog: Everything cleared up?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yeah, it was nothing.
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: (to Ines)
dialog: There’s something all over the back of your
dialog: blazer.
text: Winfried looks at his hand. He had white face paint on it when he rubbed her neck.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Oh, no...
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: Take it off right away... There’s still time to wash
dialog: it out!
speaker_heading: BARBEL
dialog: Gall soap.
text: Renate tries to take off Ines’ blazer.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Mon, leave it. | have a whole suitcase full of
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I’m sorry about that.
speaker_heading: INES
text: It’s just a tiny spot.
text: Winfried’s blood pressure monitor starts to inflate.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Just my blood pressure monitor.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Nothing. Routine.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: And am I supposed to get your outfit?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: We were joking around with the school band.
dialog: Saying goodbye to our principal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: That doesn’t explain anything, but whatever.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I'll wash this stuff off now.
text: Winfried leaves.
scene_heading: INT. - RENATE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Winfried exits the bathroom, now without his face paint. He’s just finishing a phone
text: call. He still looks ill, however, because he hasn’t been able to wash off all of the
text: paint. He spots Renate in the kitchen and walks over to her.
scene_heading: INT. - RENATE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Winfried leans on the countertop next to Renate.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I’m afraid I have to leave soon. Willi’s at my
dialog: mother’s place.
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: And how’s he doing?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Quite good. Sleeps a lot.
text: He pulls a dental retainer box from his jacket pocket, takes out the false teeth and
text: shows them to Renate.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: They’re almost broken again, here. Can you fix
dialog: them again with that professional glue?
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: Sure. You're a private patient, so I’ll do anything.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Yeah, I don’t dare go to the doctor any more.
dialog: Everyone wants to treat me right away.
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: That thing is so annoying when you're sleeping.
dialog: We've had it, too. Is there a specific reason?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Nothing, but they’re giving me a blood thinner
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: RENATE
text: Gerhard takes that, too.
text: She gestures at a pretty pillbox with compartments for each day of the week.
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: You guys should talk sometime.
text: Winfried puts in the false teeth.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Could you make them permanent, too? I find my
dialog: crowns so boring.
text: Renate laughs. She looks into the darkened garden, in which Ines’ outline is visible.
speaker_heading: RENATE
text: All she does is talk on the phone.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: We must've done something wrong.
scene_heading: EXT. - RENATE’S HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY
text: Winfried walks through the garden, searching. He’s put his jacket on again. The
text: garden is empty.
scene_heading: EXT. - IN FRONT OF RENATE’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Winfried walks around the house and spies Ines next to the garages. For a moment,
text: it’s as if she’s hiding from her family. Her shoulders are hunched and she’s smoking.
text: She holds her Blackberry in one hand. Winfried is just a few meters away from her
text: when Renate calls to him from the house.
speaker_heading: RENATE
text: (indistinctly, from far away)
dialog: Come back inside!
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I’m still on the phone!
text: Ines thinks Renate was calling to her. Only then does she see Winfried standing next
text: to her. She reflexively lifts the phone and now that she has it at her ear, she carries
dialog: on acting.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yeah, good. And what else did he say? OK, that’s
dialog: no bad thing.
dialog: (quietly, to Winfried)
dialog: I’m almost done, Dad.
text: Winfried waits. Ines acts out the phone call so convincingly that he suddenly
text: wonders whether there really might be someone on the other end.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: All the same, I'd like to get back in touch
dialog: tomorrow. But I’m glad we talked. Yes, you have
dialog: anice evening, too.
text: She hangs up.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Everything OK?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: A bit of stress... Are you leaving already?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I’m afraid I have to. Do you want to come to
dialog: Grandma’s for breakfast tomorrow?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I’m flying at ten already. Did you tell her I’m
dialog: here?
text: Winfried shakes his head.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: It doesn’t matter, I’ll call Inge. I’ve hired someone
dialog: to bea substitute daughter, anyway.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Aha. And what kind of stuff does she do?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Different things. Sometimes I just want her to
dialog: bake a cake. Sometimes she helps me to cut my
dialog: toenails. The kinds of things daughters normally
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: So she can call you on your birthday, too. Then I
dialog: don’t have to worry about it.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: It was only a joke.
text: Renate approaches the two of them carrying a wrapped up piece of cake and the hat,
text: which Winfried had forgotten. By way of a goodbye, Winfried simply takes Ines’
text: hand firmly in his.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t know if I still have make-up anywhere.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: It’s a shame this was so brief. We'll havea really
text: long Skype soon.
text: Her tone is particularly tender, and it almost sounds like she’s talking to a small
dialog: child.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Right, sure. My Skype’s working again.
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: Yeah, she shouldn’t work so much.
text: Renate pinches Ines’ cheek.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: She’s doing great.
scene_heading: EXT. - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - GARDEN - NIGHT
text: Winfried walks into his garden. He’s fetched a blanket and a bowl of ice cubes. Willi
text: lies on the lawn in the garden. The dog isn’t well. Winfried lies down very close to
text: him ona pillow taken from a chair. It’s a bright, windy night. He pulls the blanket
text: over himself and shuffles even closer to his dog, who is now pretty much only
dialog: exhaling.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: My Willi, don’t be frightened. Don’t be
dialog: frightened. Are you my dear Willi...such a lovely
dialog: Willi.
text: As he speaks, he gives the dog two ice cubes to lick. They clink quietly. Willi tries to
text: stand up but falls to one side. Winfried again shuffles closer to him.
scene_heading: EXT. - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - GARDEN - DAWN
text: The sun is rising when Winfried wakes up on the lawn. Willi is no longer lying next
text: to him. Winfried sits up. He spots Will a few meters away, under a bush. He kneels
text: down next to him and touches him. The dog is dead.
scene_heading: INT. - WINFRIED’S HOUSE - KITCHEN OR LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Winfried has gone into his house. He stands for a moment in the kitchen. He reaches
text: for the coffee filters. He looks out of the window at his dog, as if he’s waiting for Willi
text: to get up again, after all. But the fur under the bush is so motionless that it suddenly
text: seems fake. Only the bush above it moves.
scene_heading: INT. - BUCHAREST OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY
text: Winfried sits in the modern reception area of an office building. He’s wearing
text: sunglasses and holding a newspaper. He peers at the entrance doors. Now and
text: again, businesspeople enter the lobby and employees leave the building. The
text: elevator doors opposite him open, so Winfried lifts up the newspaper. An unknown
text: man in a suit steps out. Winfried lowers his newspaper again. He begins to rip a
text: small hole in the paper. He looks at the modern, illuminated reception desk. Behind
text: it, two female RECEPTIONISTS, with their hair styled in tall up-dos, appear to be
text: talking about him. One of them walks over to him in her high-heeled shoes.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Are you sure you don’t want us to call someone?
text: She speaks English with an Eastern European accent.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: No, thank you.
text: The receptionist nods and walks back to her desk, where she whispers to her
text: colleague. It becomes clear that Winfried has already been sitting here for quite
text: some time: He’s raised the women’s suspicions. Winfried folds up his newspaper. At
text: that moment, a group of businesspeople (including HENNEBERG, DASCALU and
text: ANCA) enters the building. Winfried spots Ines among them. Quick as a flash, he
text: puts in the false teeth, lifts up the newspaper and walks along next to the group,
text: conspicuous in his effort to be inconspicuous. Ines looks straight at him, and, for a
text: moment, she seems to freeze. But then she walks on and continues her conversation
text: with a colleague, who turns around to face her. Winfried watches her, and the group
text: disappears into an elevator beyond a staff-only barrier. Winfried walks onwards,
text: out of the building. Outside, he removes the false teeth and sunglasses. For a
text: moment he stands there, perplexed, unsure whether Ines saw him or not.
scene_heading: EXT. - IN FRONT OF BUCHAREST OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
text: Winfried walks outside, onto the street. New, modern glass buildings contrast with
text: dilapidated blocks from the Ceausescu era.
text: Winfried looks around and is about to continue when, suddenly, a young Romanian
text: woman wearing a business suit stops him.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: (in English)
dialog: Excuse me, I am sorry... Are you Mr. Conradi?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (mixing German and English)
dialog: Ja. Yes.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: Hello, Anca Pavelescu. I am the assistant of Ms.
dialog: Conradi. One minute please...
text: Anca puts her cellphone to her ear and speaks to someone.
speaker_heading: ANCA (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, I got him.
text: She hands the phone to Winfried.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Hello. I’m sorry. Just a flying visit. No, you don’t
dialog: have to come here. I'll book myself into a hotel
dialog: somewhere. Yeah, nothing, no. No, really,
dialog: nothing’s wrong.
text: He listens, and relents.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: OK... fine. Yes, OK. See you later.
text: He hands the phone back to Anca.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: (in English)
dialog: I shall follow you.
text: Anca looks at him in surprise.
scene_heading: EXT. - BUCHAREST OFFICE BUILDING - ROOF TERRACE - DAY
text: Winfried sits with Anca on the office building's modern roof terrace. She has laid out
text: a few tourist brochures and a city map, which she’s marking with crosses.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: And here is the Radisson, also one of the five-star
dialog: hotels in town. The restaurant is excellent. And
dialog: there is also a nice cigar lounge for business
dialog: meetings... or drinks in the evening.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Iam only the father. Just holidays.
dialog: (in German)
dialog: I don’t really look the part.
text: Anca’s cellphone rings. She listens with intense concentration. Winfried looks
text: around at the terrace. A few people in suits are sitting and smoking.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: She asks whether you would like to accompany
dialog: her to a reception of the American embassy this
dialog: evening?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Was that she?
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: (in German)
text: Yes, she’s still in the meeting.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (mixing German and English)
dialog: OK. When she will...
text: For a moment, neither of them knows what to talk about.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: (in German)
dialog: And how is my daughter as a boss?
dialog: (in English)
dialog: As your chief?
text: Anca isn’t sure how to respond.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: Yes, she’s very honest, and she gives me a lot of
dialog: feedback... about my performance.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (stammering in English)
dialog: “Performance?” This means... this describes your
dialog: job?
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Performance means my work in general... in
text: meetings, with the team, dealing with clients.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: And what's most important when dealing with
dialog: clients?
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: That no concept makes sense if the client doesn’t
dialog: want it. It’s an art to tell the client what he
dialog: actually wants.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I’m sure my daughter’s good at that.
scene_heading: INT. - CAR - HOTEL FORECOURT - EVENING
text: Winfried sits on the back seat of a spacious car being driven towards the entrance to
text: a hotel. The driver, BOGDAN, is speaking to someone via a cellphone earpiece.
speaker_heading: BOGDAN
dialog: (into earpiece)
dialog: Weare here.
dialog: (to Winfried)
text: She is coming.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Thank you.
text: He pats Bogdan on the shoulder. Outside, Ines hurries out of the hotel and climbs
text: into the back seat of the car, next to Winfried. She kisses him on both cheeks.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Wow, what a long day, right?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Yeah, well, sure, you have to work.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I've really invaded you here, huh?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: How long were you actually sitting there?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Three hours. I wasn’t even sure you’d recognized
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes, I did, but that was the entire Romanian
dialog: board of Dacoil. How was everything with Anca?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: They were all terribly nice to me.
text: Winfried nods towards Bogdan.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
text: The driver, too.
text: Ines nods and smiles tensely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INES CONRADI
dialog: So listen, concerning this event tonight: It’s a
dialog: business reception given by the American
dialog: Embassy. There'll be speeches, appetizers, small
dialog: talk and that’s it.
text: Ines looks at her cellphone and rejects an incoming call.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Great. Can I go like this?
text: He’s wearing dark-colored jeans, a shirt and walking shoes. Ines tries to gloss over
dialog: the problem.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yeah, that’s OK.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: There’s a great football match today, too. If
dialog: Bogdan drops me somewhere... I'll have a beer.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: But I’ve already arranged this now.
text: Winfried quickly takes his false teeth from his jacket pocket and puts them in his
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I just wasn’t sure whether it’s really OK for you
dialog: and the ambassador...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Are you interested now or not?
text: He takes the teeth out again. She looks at the entrance. Other people are already
text: going inside.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Of course. I think it’s amazing that you're taking
dialog: me with you. I’ve never been inside an embassy
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: That's a hotel.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Oh, right.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Just one last thing: After the reception, if there’s
dialog: achance to have a drink with the CEO,
dialog: Henneberg, our client, I have to go alone, OK? I’m
dialog: fighting right now to get our contract extended.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Yeah, of course. No concept makes sense without
dialog: the client.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: You can say you're my father, but maybe that
dialog: you're tired because you've done so much
dialog: sightseeing, or something.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: But I also don’t mind if you tell them I’m your
dialog: Grandma.
text: Ines and Winfried get out of the car.
scene_heading: INT. - HOTEL LOBBY - STAIRCASE - EVENING
text: Ines and Winfried enter the lobby of a large communist-era hotel. Winfried looks
text: around with interest. Ines walks purposefully to the table where the guest list is and
text: procures two wristbands. Guests hurry up a staircase. Ines realizes that the
text: speeches have already begun. She glances quickly at her phone. Then she and
text: Winfried walk up a grand, communist-era staircase towards a room in which a
text: speech is already being held.
scene_heading: INT. - HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: Ines and Winfried slip into the ballroom, which is full of people. Bar tables are lit in
text: the colors of the U.S. flag. People are clapping, and Ines joins in without knowing
dialog: what was just being said.
speaker_heading: U.S. AMBASSADOR
dialog: But this is still not the answer to this simple and
dialog: serious question: Why Romania? And as an
dialog: ambassador in this country one must have a
dialog: good answer to that. And I have one: Romania
dialog: offers significant opportunities to American
dialog: businesses with products, services, or
dialog: technologies that either meet growing private
dialog: demand or contribute to the country’s
dialog: development priorities.
text: Ines looks around discreetly and, once again, claps along distractedly with everyone
text: else. Most of the guests are businesspeople of various nationalities. The Ambassador
text: says a few words in Romanian and then brings his speech to a close.
speaker_heading: U.S. AMBASSADOR (CONT’D)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, the buffet is open!
scene_heading: INT. - HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: The speech is over, and the guests move towards the buffet. Ines looks around and
text: eyes a group of businesspeople. Winfried looks at a man he thinks he recognizes.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Hey, that guy looks like Tiriac.
text: Ines looks half-heartedly towards the man in question.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yeah, maybe. Could you grab us something from
dialog: the buffet?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: OK.
text: Ines watches as Winfried walks to the buffet. She’s glad to have him occupied. She
text: edges towards the businesspeople (VERMILLARD, DASCALU). She shrewdly waits
text: until an opportunity presents itself, then homes in on Henneberg, a man aged
text: around 60, and shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Our third time today, finally... Good evening.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: Yes, good evening.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: That was a fascinating speech...
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: Yes, we're not where we want to be yet, but
dialog: Romania has really shown great economic
dialog: strength in overcoming the crisis.
text: Henneberg glances at the other people lining up to speak to him.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I looked at our business case again. And I’m
dialog: optimistic that we'll be able to make a well-
dialog: founded statement on Monday.
text: Without really having listened, Henneberg turns and gestures at a pretty, Russian-
text: looking woman (NATALJA) aged around 40.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: Natalja, here is your specialist. I’m sure Ms.
dialog: Conradi can help you.
speaker_heading: NATALJA
dialog: So nice to meet you.
text: Ines doesn’t know what this is about, but nonetheless she’s pleased that she’s been
text: drawn in so quickly.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: She needs to do some shopping tomorrow.
dialog: (to Natalja)
dialog: Ms. Conradi works in Bucharest for... how long?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: It’s been almost a year now. You keep me busy.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: So I guess you can ask her any shopping
dialog: question.
text: The two women shake hands. Henneberg turns away to a new, far more interesting
text: conversational partner - MR. MYERS, an American.
speaker_heading: NATALJA
dialog: I’m sorry for this. | am sure you are busy, but...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, it’s OK.
speaker_heading: NATALJA
dialog: We have this wedding in Moscow this weekend.
dialog: And I still need some presents.
text: Ines is still looking at Henneberg, who has now been accosted by Dascalu.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I don’t do too much shopping here myself, but
dialog: there are several big malls. Plus, there is an area
dialog: with exclusive shops... depends on what you
dialog: need.
speaker_heading: NATALJA
dialog: The mall is OK. I have only two hours tomorrow.
dialog: Ialso need children’s stuff, cosmetics...
text: In the background, Winfried reappears carrying two plates piled with food. He puts
text: them down ona table next to Henneberg.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Why don’t you give me your number, and I'll
dialog: scout for the best place and text you?
text: The two women begin to swap their numbers. The others say goodbye to
text: Henneberg, the executive. He’s used to having people line up to speak to him, so he
text: turns to Winfried, assuming that he’s next.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: Good evening.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Good evening. I’m just the father.
text: Winfried nods towards Ines.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: Isee.
text: The two women are still talking.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (to Natalja)
dialog: I have been to Moscow only once, but I really
dialog: loved it. I was so impressed by the Bolshoi
dialog: Theater.
speaker_heading: NATALJA
dialog: Oh yes, it is a remarkable place.
text: Ines keeps an eye on her father while she continues to listen to Natalja.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: (to Winfried)
dialog: Are you visiting?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Yes. A totally spontaneous decision. I’ve never
dialog: been to Romania before.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: Then you just had a good introduction from the
dialog: Ambassador.
text: Their conversation comes to an amicable halt.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I’m actually here to negotiate with her. She’s
dialog: hardly at home anymore, so I hired someone to
dialog: be a substitute daughter. A really nice young
dialog: woman. Now it’s just the question of who pays
dialog: her.
text: Henneberg can’t help but laugh. Ines is straining to hear what her father’s saying,
text: whilst also trying to politely focus on Natalja.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: That’s a modern solution. And is the other
dialog: daughter better than her?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: The cakes are better, and she cuts my toenails.
text: Again, the executive can’t help but laugh. Winfried gestures towards Natalja.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: But she’s not your daughter, right?
text: Ines freezes. It was obviously a joke. The executive grins and shakes his head, but
text: then firmly says his goodbyes and turns to someone else. Natalja joins him. Winfried
text: and Ines are left by themselves. Winfried gives Ines her plate, which is full of small
text: appetizers. Ines says nothing and, for a moment, she seems despondent.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: He’s the CEO I told you about. He’s a really
dialog: important contact for me.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: OK. Criticism accepted.
dialog: (referring to the food)
dialog: I didn’t know what you like.
text: Awoman (TATJANA) interrupts Ines from behind. She’s passing by, struggling to
text: keep up with a group of Chinese businesspeople.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: I’m freaking out with these Chinese wannabe
dialog: investors. Are you coming on Monday?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes, but text me where...
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: Da Vinci, 9 p.m.
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I don’t know what to talk about.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Just talk about food. That always works.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: Like “What’s your favorite Wan-Tan?” I know
dialog: nothing about Chinese food.
scene_heading: EXT. - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
text: The reception guests are slowly leaving. Winfried arrives carrying his and Ines’
text: jackets. Ines is still looking over at the group surrounding Henneberg (Vermillard,
text: Dascalu, Myers). They’re already making their way towards the exit. She and
text: Winfried also walk towards it. Suddenly, Henneberg is behind them and addresses
dialog: Winfried.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: (in English)
dialog: Want to join us for a drink?
text: He catches himself and switches to German.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going for a drink, if you’d like to join us.
dialog: What was your name again?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Winfried.
text: Henneberg also looks at Ines, but the question seems to be aimed mostly at
text: Winfried. Natalja joins him, and she seems to be keen for Ines to come along, too.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you, that’s terribly nice of you, but I’m too
dialog: tired. I’ve done too much today. Sightseeing.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in English)
dialog: But I'd love to grab a drink. Where are you
dialog: going?
text: Because it’s an international group, she’s switched into English.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: I think your father would like you to join him.
text: Henneberg says it so bluntly that it almost sounds like he’s withdrawing the
dialog: invitation.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (to Winfried)
dialog: Come on, one more drink.
text: The situation becomes uncertain, and the group is waiting.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: No, no, I have to sleep. I walked through the
dialog: whole... Ceausescu palace today.
speaker_heading: DASCALU
dialog: (with a Romanian accent)
dialog: Is it open again to public?
text: Ines greets Dascalu, a Romanian manager aged around 50, with a handshake. The
text: group turns to leave.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (to Winfried)
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Oh right, you want me to come now?
text: Ines nods discreetly.
scene_heading: EXT. - DA VINCI] LAKESIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: A classy restaurant where foreign businesspeople meet and the Romanian upper
text: class flashes its cash. The group sits on a terrace near a swimming pool. A select
text: group of people surrounds Henneberg: Natalja, Winfried and Ines along with three
text: further businesspeople, M. Vermillard, Mr. Myers and Dascalu. They all appear to be
text: managers or business partners of Dacoil. Winfried has a large glass of beer in front
text: of him. The others are more refined, with glasses of wine and champagne.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: Bring your wife next time... and spend a
dialog: weekend. The sea is very close and there are
dialog: good French private schools. Romania is a lot
dialog: better than its reputation. You can have a good
dialog: life here.
text: He’s addressing the French businessman, Vermillard, who will soon take up a post in
dialog: Bucharest.
speaker_heading: VERMILLARD
dialog: I saw some houses today. I am already
dialog: convinced.
text: Natalja is sitting next to Ines.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (to Natalja)
dialog: Where do you live?
speaker_heading: NATALJA
dialog: I live mostly in Frankfurt and France.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: How nice...
speaker_heading: NATALJA
dialog: I really like Frankfurt. I like countries with a
dialog: middle class. They are relaxing me.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in German)
dialog: I totally understand.
text: Ines picks up a piece of octopus carpaccio and tries to give some to Winfried, but he
dialog: refuses.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Try something different for a change.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: You know me.
text: Ines focuses on the conversation.
speaker_heading: MYERS
dialog: But the crazy times are over.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: There is still a lot of potential. I just told Van
dialog: Rompuy, letting Romania in was one of the rare
dialog: EU decisions that was actually good. You just
dialog: have to change the corporate culture.
speaker_heading: VERMILLARD
dialog: (to Henneberg and Dascalu)
dialog: Tell mea bit about the young Romanian manager
dialog: generation?
text: Dascalu is about to respond when Henneberg turns to Ines.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: She is the specialist. She has all the insights.
text: For a moment, Ines is surprised that he’s deferring to her on such a pertinent
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: So, when I started here I was really surprised.
dialog: Almost everyone did a Master's degree abroad,
dialog: speaks several languages. They are all very
dialog: dedicated. I would even say most of them have a
dialog: very international way of thinking. Which is
dialog: great.
text: Ines’ English is so perfect that she could be mistaken for an American. The way in
text: which she speaks is self-confident and to-the-point. Dascalu, the Romanian manager,
text: interrupts her.
speaker_heading: DASCALU
dialog: But they don’t understand Romania any more.
dialog: They are faster than the rest of the country, they
dialog: don’t want to stay here. I don’t believe very much
text: in an international perspective.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I was just trying to say that knowledge is
dialog: international. | totally agree with that, too.
speaker_heading: DASCALU
dialog: Romanian knowledge runs deep. Take a look at
dialog: our oilfields.
text: It’s not clear how ironic he’s being. To be safe, Ines laughs. Winfried is listening
text: distractedly to a mediocre pianist.
speaker_heading: VERMILLARD
dialog: (to Ines)
dialog: What exactly are you doing in Dacoil?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: lama consultant at Morrisons. We are working
dialog: for Dacoil evaluating if it will pay off to outsource
dialog: some services.
text: Dascalu frowns briefly, and Henneberg notices this.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Interesting how you describe your job.
text: His tone is cutting.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in German)
dialog: I’m sorry, please say it in your own words.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: (in English, to the group)
dialog: She is evaluating a way to improve our
dialog: maintenance service. We see outsourcing as the
dialog: last option of many.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I’m sorry, this is what I tried to say.
text: For a moment, the group falls silent.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: But her father had a great business idea for
dialog: Romania. He hired another girl at home to be his
dialog: daughter. Because this one is never there and he
dialog: needs somebody to cut his toenails.
text: Everyone laughs slightly. Ines, too, bravely laughs along. Henneberg checks his
text: watch. Winfried puts the false teeth in his mouth and quietly mutters at Henneberg.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Don't you dare steal my idea.
text: He very quickly puts the teeth away again.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: Sorry, I like to make jokes.
text: Henneberg laughs indulgently, but it’s clear that he’s now dismissed Winfried as a
dialog: total madman.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: (in German)
dialog: No, we’re incredibly proud of her. What she does
dialog: here... and stuff.
text: Ines smiles, trying to rise above the situation. Henneberg gestures at a WAITER to
text: bring him the check. Henneberg stands up and shakes hands with everyone.
text: Now that Henneberg is gone, the rest of the group immediately dissipates. Dascalu
text: follows Henneberg. The Belgian and the Frenchman talk for another minute. The
text: waiter brings Winfried another beer.
scene_heading: EXT. - DA VINCI] LAKESIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Ines and Winfried now sit alone at the otherwise empty table with Winfried’s beer.
text: Ines remains silent for a while trying to cope with her anger.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Why do you do stuff like that when I’ve explicitly
dialog: asked you not to?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I somehow had to make it clear to him that it was
dialog: a joke. What exactly is “outsourcing” again?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: It’s when you transfer work to another company.
dialog: He wants to transfer the maintenance of the oil
dialog: installations to another company.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: So what was wrong with that?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Ijust shouldn’t have let it slip out... He wants us
dialog: to prove that it’s precisely the right thing to do,
dialog: but he doesn’t want it to be his idea - so he can
dialog: pin the responsibility on us if he needs to.
dialog: She doesn’t want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: And... what are you responsible for?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Dad, these processes mean hundreds of
text: employees being transferred and later laid off.
dialog: These kind of decisions are unpopular, so he
dialog: needs to be able to blame someone else. Then
dialog: you can read in the paper again that some
dialog: consulting firm has ruined something.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: It’s incredible the kinds of decisions you're
dialog: involved in making.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Again: I don’t make any decisions. I just do the
dialog: calculations. You know that.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I’m not criticizing you. I just want to understand
dialog: it. What these projects are about...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: How long are you planning to stay?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I took a month off.
text: Ines freezes for a second.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: That was real fear.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT
text: Winfried sits on a freshly-made sofa-bed, digging in his suitcase. He swallows a
text: couple of pills from his new pillbox. The room’s decor is impersonal. Ines steps into
text: the doorway and watches as Winfried takes a bag from his suitcase and tries to
text: smooth out a gift’s crumpled wrapping paper. From it hangs a photo of Willi, which
text: he quickly removes.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: In the living room, Winfried puts a sausage from his local butcher, a bottle of
text: Riesling and a packet of Aachener Printen gingerbread cookies on the table. Ines
text: quickly takes a final look at her laptop, which is also on the table. The living room
text: opens out onto a large roof terrace. The whole place seems sterile and a bit
dialog: American: the kind of luxury you can find anywhere in the world. Only a few objects
dialog: hint at the fact that we’re in Eastern Europe.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Ijust have a massage tomorrow. After that, I’ll
dialog: show you Bucharest.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: OK, but only if it suits you. So, here’s your
dialog: present. If you don’t like it, throw it away.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Thank you... Why didn’t you wait and come on
dialog: my actual birthday?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I don’t know what your plans are.
text: Ines unwraps the gift and pulls out an expensive designer cheese grater.
speaker_heading: IN
speaker_heading: mH
speaker_heading: Ss
dialog: Oh, wow...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: That’s a really good cheese grater. A French one,
dialog: from Designo.
text: Ines puts the grater to one side and folds the wrapping paper.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: I just happened to walk past the store. It always
dialog: annoys me when the parmesan is so hard.
dialog: There’s something in that little roll, too. Buy
dialog: yourself a blazer, or something else...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: You don’t have to give me money. Thank you...
text: She doesn’t open up the roll of bills.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: And who did you leave Willi with?
speaker_heading: WwW
speaker_heading: NFRIED
dialog: Well, Willi... Willi unfortunately died.
text: Ines looks at him confused and

scene_heading: INT. - HOTEL POOL AREA - DAY
text: Winfried waits on a lounger in the chic pool area of a hotel. He’s taken off his shirt

speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Man, that was bad. I walked out. I’m not paying

speaker_heading: SPA MANAGER
dialog: We are sorry for the inconvenience. Who was the

speaker_heading: INES

speaker_heading: SPA MANAGER

speaker_heading: SPA MANAGER
dialog: Can I bring you something to drink?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: At your expense?
speaker_heading: SPA MANAGER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Oh, great, we'll have two glasses of champagne,
text: two freshly squeezed orange juices and two club
dialog: sandwiches.
text: The manager balks at the size of the order, but says nothing. He leaves.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Wasn't that a bit much?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, it’s fine. My company spends so much money

speaker_heading: IN

speaker_heading: IN
speaker_heading: ES (CONT’D)
dialog: One day, I'll explain to you how to ask questions
dialog: if you want to find something out about
dialog: someone.
text: The two flutes of champagne arrive. They briefly clink their glasses together.
text: Winfried puts in the false teeth, flops back on the lounger, and drinks his champagne
text: with gusto. Ines ignores his joke.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Tell me something about you. How’s Grandma
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: That’s a good sign, ma’am. I wasn’t at all sure
dialog: whether you knew your Grandma was still alive.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Dad, I’m tired of your jokes.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Because | don’t find them funny.
text: Ines’ cellphone rings. She looks at the screen and stands up when she sees who's
text: calling. She walks away. The WAITER brings the club sandwiches. Ines hangs up and
text: returns to Winfried.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit, I have to meet Natalja, Henneberg’s wife.
dialog: She’s at this mall. I’m afraid it’s important.
text: She starts to pack her bag. Winfried takes another bite of his sandwich.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s actually way more interesting and Romanian
dialog: than the Ceausescu palace. It’s Europe’s largest
dialog: mall and no one has money to buy anything. It
dialog: won't take long. I’ll show you around afterwards.
scene_heading: INT. - SHOPPING MALL - VIEWING GALLERY - DAY
text: Winfried sits on a stool at a bar table and looks out from a viewing gallery onto an
text: ice rink. A group of children is trying to skate with the help of plastic penguins.
text: Weaving between them are a couple of young professionals who glide elegantly
text: across the ice. A WAITER brings the check. Winfried gulps the dregs of his coffee and
text: picks up his tattered newspaper. He stands up. The mall is a temple to consumption
text: beyond anything found even in the USA: waterfalls tumbling over plastic cliffs, an ice
text: rink, slot machines and stores. These elements come together in an explosion of
text: capitalist futurism. Winfried walks past huge ice cream dispensers. Next to them, a
text: bored woman reads a book.
scene_heading: INT. - SHOPPING MALL - DAY
text: Winfried walks along a row of storefronts, searching. He spots Ines, who’s still
text: talking to Natalja in front of a shoe store. Natalja sees him first. Ines follows her gaze
text: and turns around.
speaker_heading: NATALJA
dialog: I’m so sorry, Mr. Conradi. This is such an awful
dialog: place...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in German)
dialog: You poor thing, you had to wait ages.
text: Ines briefly puts her arm in Winfried’s. A man, Natalja’s DRIVER, silently appears
text: next to them.
speaker_heading: NATALJA
dialog: Ihave to hurry... Thank you Ines, you saved my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, I really enjoyed it.
text: To prove her point, she holds up a shopping bag full of things she’s bought for
text: herself. Natalja kisses Ines on both cheeks and disappears.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Man, was it very terrible?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Are you really a human?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: No, it was great here. I watched some wonderful

speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Do you still want to do something? Go to the

speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Or go home?
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - OPEN-PLAN KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Back in the apartment. Winfried stands the kitchen, where he’s started making
text: spaghetti. He chops an onion and looks at Ines, who’s on her phone on the roof
text: terrace. She comes back inside and sits down in front of her computer. Winfried puts
text: a glass of red wine down next to it.

speaker_heading: INES
dialog: It’s OK... It’s obvious you'd think that. I’m going

dialog: midnight.
text: She disappears into her bedroom.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. - INES’ APARTMENT - KITCHEN - ROOF TERRACE - NIGHT
text: Winfried stands in Ines’ kitchen, cooking. Out on the roof terrace, he sets a table
text: that’s otherwise never used. He puts the salad and spaghetti on the table.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - INES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Winfried opens the door to Ines’ bedroom. Ines is fast asleep. He calls to her, but she
text: doesn’t react. He kneels down next to her and touches her shoulder, but she’s
text: sleeping deeply and soundly. He looks at her sparse possessions. Next to her on the
text: bed is a threadbare little corduroy pillow that he seems to recognize. He closes the
text: door again.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. - INES’ APARTMENT - TERRACE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Winfried stands on the roof terrace. He picks up his camera and takes a photo of the
text: Ceausescu palace, which is visible in the distance. Then he photographs parts of
text: Ines’ apartment. He looks at a pile of books and picks up one that’s lying on top. It’s a
text: best-selling self-help book about charisma. He walks back to the terrace, sits down
text: alone and starts eating and flicking through the book.

speaker_heading: INES

speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: You were so fast asleep.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I thought you wanted to wake me up for dinner.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I tried to.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Shit!
text: She walks past Winfried and out of the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. - INES’ APARTMENT - KITCHEN - ROOF TERRACE - DAY
text: Ines pulls her cellphone from its charger. Winfried follows her uncertainly.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Ihave four missed calls from them! You told me
dialog: you were making something to eat.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I thought you needed the sleep. Or that you'd set
text: an alarm.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Do you know what this could mean for me? I
dialog: have a presentation on Monday that I’ve worked
dialog: on for weeks... I’m not doing this for fun. I can’t
dialog: afford to just stand up someone like him.
text: Ines grabs the charisma book from Winfried and puts it away. She looks frantically
text: at her cellphone. Winfried sits down at the table, which he has lovingly set for
dialog: breakfast.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I just don’t know if you’re always doing as well
dialog: as you Say you are.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Dad, this is going to sound cruel, but... even if I
dialog: wanted to jump out of the window, you and the
dialog: cheese grater wouldn’t be the combination to
dialog: stop me.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: No, of course not.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Do you have any plans in life other than slipping
dialog: fart cushions under people?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I don’t own a fart cushion.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I know men your age who still have ambitions.
dialog: But who cares?
text: Ines slowly sits down at the table. Winfried pours coffee for her.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - DAY
text: Winfried stands in his room, packing his suitcase. Ines comes and hands him a bottle
text: of shampoo he left in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: Anyway, it was still really nice. Now I know the
dialog: kinds of things you do here.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yeah, and let’s fix a date next time. Then I'll have
dialog: time.
text: Ines turns away to fold up the sofa-bed. She shakes it because it’s refusing to fold.
text: Suddenly, she screams in pain and pulls the sofa abruptly upwards. She’s caught her
text: toe in it. Her pain is extreme. She looks at her toe in shock. Right away, a pool of
text: blood forms underneath the toenail. Winfried inspects her foot.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
text: It’s definitely not broken, though.
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: I could pierce it to release the pressure.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, I'll wait first...
text: She stands up and suppresses the pain. Whatever happens, she wants Winfried to
dialog: leave.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - HALLWAY - ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Hobbling, Ines accompanies Winfried to the door, where his suitcase is waiting. He
text: hangs a travel pouch around his neck with his plane ticket inside. Ines presses the
text: elevator “call” button.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: But I can’t leave you here like this.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: It’s not that bad. Well, then... bye.
text: They hug briefly.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Call me if anything’s wrong.
text: Winfried nods. Winfried and Ines stand in silence, waiting for the elevator to arrive.
text: The elevator arrives and Winfried disappears into it.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. - INES’ APARTMENT - HALLWAY - ROOF TERRACE - DAY
text: Ines hobbles onto her roof terrace and looks out over the edge. The building is tall,
text: and her father is visible only as a tiny figure. He looks up and spots her. He stands
text: still for a moment, as if he’s forgotten something. Then he waves at her. She waves
text: back. Suddenly, tears start streaming over her cheeks. Ines starts sobbing and
text: watches tearfully as the taxi disappears around a corner.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: It’s now gotten dark. Ines is wearing pajamas and drinking wine. With the
text: concentration of an actress learning lines, she rehearses and refines her
text: presentation. Her “performance” stands in stark contrast to the image she projects
text: in her pajamas. She tweaks certain words and we notice that she’s honing her
text: intonation. As she murmurs about EU regulations and economic viability, she walks
text: to the refrigerator. She tries to ignore her painful foot. She finds the leftover
text: spaghetti that her father has carefully covered with plastic film. Next to it is the
text: cheese grater. She takes a piece of parmesan, walks back to her laptop and starts to
text: grate the parmesan onto the spaghetti. She coils the spaghetti absent-mindedly
text: around her fork and eats hungrily while she surfs the internet.
scene_heading: EXT. - STREET IN FRONT OF INES’ APARTMENT - DAY
text: Ines waits in front of her apartment block. She’s wearing a suit and typing
text: something on her Blackberry. We hear notification sounds as she sends emails. She
text: takes off her shoe and puts her foot down on the asphalt. A WOMAN sits on the
text: street opposite her, trying to sell two bunches of flowers. A CHILD approaches Ines
text: and offers her a packet of kleenex. She gives the child a bill and explains to him that
text: she won't give him something every day. There’s a honk. Ines slips her shoe back on,
text: hobbles towards a dark-colored sedan car and climbs into the back.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ CAR - JOURNEY FROM APARTMENT TO DACOIL - DAY
text: Ines’ boss GERALD (late 40s) and TIM (late 20s), an athletic-looking young
text: consultant, are already in the car. Ines sits next to Gerald.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Bucuresti...
text: Tim turns around to Ines and smiles at her.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Good morning. Were you on the same flight?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: No, I was in Zurich. And how was it with
dialog: Henneberg?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: A bit annoying, because I had to go shopping
dialog: with his wife for three hours. But we had dinner
dialog: and I put out my feelers. My impression is that
dialog: he’s become more cautious of outsourcing, or
dialog: that he has new opponents... That topic definitely
dialog: caused tension.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: OK, that comes as a surprise.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: So I reworked the presentation, and I think we
dialog: should definitely --
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Use a softer touch?
text: Tim is keen to join in and score points with Gerald. Ines pauses and smiles at him.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Can I finish what I was saying?
text: Tim bites his tongue.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: I think we should go on the offensive. I think he’s
dialog: hoping we'll decide for him, that we'll
dialog: emphatically order it. I think he can’t be an active
dialog: proponent. So I'd like to present three options. A
dialog: full outsourcing in all assets - essentially a
dialog: radical cut. Then our option in the middle which,
text: in contrast, looks realistic and almost harmless.
dialog: And a minimal solution in just one pilot asset
dialog: that changes practically nothing.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: OK. I’m surprised. First of all, | think it’s difficult
dialog: to change the strategy so close to a meeting.
dialog: Where did you eat?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Da Vinci.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Right now, I’m not convinced...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Argument number two is Iliescu: We have to
text: make the point that he’s blocking us. At the end
text: of the day, all the figures from Buzau are flawed.
dialog: For a clear business case, we’d need much more
text: from Illiescu. Every other table is incomplete.
dialog: (to Tim)
dialog: I’m not criticizing you, but we can’t make a clear
dialog: statement anyway, so that’s why we need: three
dialog: options.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: OK.
text: It takes a while until Gerald answer.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Illiescu isn’t an issue for the steering committee.
dialog: We'll put this in a comfort zone. The three
dialog: options are OK if you really feel confident.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Absolutely. The final point is Dascalu. Things are
dialog: still difficult with him. I think we should involve
dialog: him more. Also because of Illiescu. He has the
dialog: best rapport with him. He'll definitely be our
dialog: opponent.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Is that little Anca going to be there today as well?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes, she'll be clicking the PowerPoint.
scene_heading: EXT. - STREET IN FRONT OF DACOIL OFFICES - DAY
text: The car pulls up near Dacoil’s office building. Gerald gets out.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Do you want me to be there?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I think it’s better if I do it alone. Let’s talk about
dialog: that in a minute...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: OK.
text: Ines’ foot is extremely painful when she stands on it.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Everything's OK.
text: Ines nods. They walk towards the office building, adjusting their suits in preparation
text: for a brief moment of performance. Ines makes an effort to walk normally despite
text: the fact that her foot is still very sore.
scene_heading: INT. - DACOIL OFFICES - BATHROOM STALL - DAY
text: Ines kneels on the floor of a toilet stall. In front of her lies an open first aid kit. She
text: takes out a syringe and pokes its needle aggressively into her toenail. With the
text: pressure released, a fountain of blood shoots through the tiny hole. The blood
text: sprays into her face and onto her light-colored blouse. Ines sits up and needs a
text: moment to overcome her queasiness. She reaches for some bathroom tissue and
text: wipes the blood from her face, then grabs her cellphone and dials a number.
scene_heading: INT. - DACOIL OFFICES - BATHROOM - DAY
text: Ines exits the toilet stall. She’s now wearing an unfamiliar blouse with short sleeves
text: and a floral pattern. She pulls her blazer on over it and looks at herself in the mirror.
text: Anca exits another stall. She’s now wearing Ines’ blood-spattered blouse.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: Is it OK?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes. Thank you.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: Iam sorry. It’s not my best.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, it’s just because of the presentation.
dialog: (in German)
dialog: It’s an unusual color.
text: Ines glances at the blood-stained blouse Anca now wears.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: I'll just put my hair over it.
text: Ines looks impatiently at her watch. They seem to be waiting for something.
speaker_heading: ANCA (CONT'D)
text: She is coming.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: (in German)
dialog: I wanted to ask, are you pleased with my work in
dialog: general?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Absolutely, I think you’ve really improved. I just
dialog: think you should try to speak more German.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: I know, but it’s not enough for everyday use.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: One more minor thing: It’s really silly, but I don’t
dialog: like those smilies in emails. | know what you
dialog: mean without them.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: I know. I am a bit addicted.
text: They’re silent for a moment.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: Why don’t we go out, like all together... the
dialog: whole team? To a club, or for dinner.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: It could be nice, just for the team.
text: Ines looks impatiently at her watch.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Thank you. !’ll think about it.
text: The door opens and FLORA, a young consultant wearing very high-heeled shoes and
text: askirt suit, enters the bathroom. She appears to have run there. She takes off her
text: jacket and shows Ines her blouse, which is very girly and exposes her back.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, this one is better.
scene_heading: INT. - DACOIL OFFICES - EXECUTIVE FLOOR - DAY
text: Ines follows INGRID across the tastefully-designed executive floor of the office
text: building. They disappear into a conference room in which Gerald and Dascalu are
text: already waiting. She greets them both.
scene_heading: INT. - DACOIL OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: A modern conference room. Henneberg sits next to Gerald, Dascalu and two further
text: ROMANIAN MANAGERS, all in leather chairs. Ines stands in front of a PowerPoint
text: presentation. The tables on the slides create patterns on her face. She’s alert,
text: keeping an eye on everyone in the room, especially Henneberg. Ingrid sits silently in
text: front of a laptop and loads the next slide for Ines.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: For option one we assume that it will take one
dialog: year for the implementation. The
dialog: implementation cost, internal and external, will
dialog: be around five to six million euros. The
dialog: advantage of a full outsourcing is the contractor
dialog: rates. We will have a strong competition
dialog: resulting in lower rates. That’s why we will end
dialog: with a ten-per-cent cost reduction in the first
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: DASCALU
dialog: I doubt very much that we will have such strong
dialog: cost reduction so quickly. It takes years to
dialog: transfer all our knowledge to the contractors.
text: Gerald nods in agreement towards Dascalu. It seems to be a tactical move.
text: Hennebers is listening very attentively, but lets the others doing the talking.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I totally agree with you. We surely need to go
dialog: further into the details of each scenario.
dialog: (to Ingrid, in German)
dialog: Ingrid, switch to the next slide, please.
text: Ingrid loads a new slide.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Option two will take about ten months with
dialog: significantly higher contractor rates. Option
dialog: three takes eight months with even higher
dialog: contractor rates.
speaker_heading: DASCALU
dialog: There is no way in which you can outsource any
dialog: maintenance services in only ten months. This is
dialog: impossible. This is more than...
dialog: (addressing one of the Dacoil
dialog: managers in Romanian)
dialog: How many employees? What do you think?
speaker_heading: DACOIL MANAGER
text: Approximately two hundred workers.
speaker_heading: DASCALU
dialog: Plus, you have to consider high costs for
dialog: supervision and training from our side too. I
dialog: don’t see them there.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: What I also think what we should put into
dialog: account is that Dacoil didn’t even realize
dialog: international HSSR standards in all assets. So we
dialog: don’t have a business case yet. But a very strong
dialog: trend. You all agreed that the implementation of
dialog: any option will not be done faster than one year,
dialog: which is also in line with HR. So we know that
dialog: the main driver is the contractor rates and I
dialog: know them.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: This is my experience, too.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: So as soon as | have realistic figures of the
dialog: personnel we can guarantee a positive business
dialog: case for option two and even for option one.
text: Dascalu shakes his head slightly.
text: Dascalu nods.
speaker_heading: DASCALU
dialog: Option one is not possible.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: OK, I absolutely agree with Mr. Dascalu that
dialog: there are many open questions. There is a lot
dialog: that needs to be analyzed in more detail. But I
dialog: would like to support Ms. Conradi. From my
dialog: point of view at least option 2 is necessary. The
dialog: big picture will not change and is absolutely in
dialog: line with my experiences from other countries.
dialog: Thank you, Ines.
dialog: (addressing Henneberg)
dialog: So now we need directions, Titus.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: Gents, we really need a waterproof and positive
dialog: business case before we can start anything. What
dialog: you are proposing, speaking of option one, would
dialog: be a heavy change for our operations. Option two
dialog: seems more realistic to me at the moment. That
dialog: also needs to be verified legally. We all know
dialog: how difficult this process will be regarding the
dialog: unions.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Absolutely, Titus.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: We have to think carefully and we need to go
dialog: into more details. But it is a very interesting
dialog: proposal.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: (to Henneberg)
dialog: At the end of this month, we should have all
dialog: calculations done.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Sorry, but I think we cannot promise anything as
dialog: long as the cooperation with Buzau will not work
dialog: better.
text: Gerald is briefly taken aback by Ines’ frank interjection. Ines looks at Dascalu.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: I would like to sit down with you, Mr. Dascalu, to
dialog: discuss how we can work more closely together
dialog: with Mr. Illiescu.
text: Dascalu waits a little too long before answering.
speaker_heading: DASCALU
dialog: I will see what I can do.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: OK, gents, get this solved. I think we are done.
dialog: Thanks a lot.
text: Henneberg stands up and swiftly says goodbye. He was itching to leave, anyway.
text: Gerald and Ines stay behind and Ingrid is also still in the room. The PowerPoint now
text: displays the company’s logo with the slogan “Performance delivered.”
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: I don’t like that you don’t stick to the plan. The
dialog: Iliescu thing wasn’t exactly elegant. The next
dialog: steps are clear. But please inform me if there are
dialog: any more problems.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: OK, I will.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: But otherwise... well done. You’re an animal,
dialog: Ines.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: Can | pull up the screen?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yeah, sure.
scene_heading: INT. - DACOIL OFFICES - KITCHENETTE - DAY
text: Ines walks through a modern, open office. She finds Tim in a little Kitchenette. Tim
text: fumbles with a coffee machine. Ines leans next to him.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Come on, don't be offended. Be happy you
dialog: weren't there.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I’m not offended.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: To quote Gerald: It’s all included in your price.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yes, but Gerald’s prices are different to mine.
dialog: What are you doing tonight?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I’m meeting Steph de Boer and Tatjana.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Women’s group?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yeah, exactly. We talk about gender quotas,
dialog: sexual harassment at work, things like that.
scene_heading: EXT. - DA VINCI LAKESIDE RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Ines gets out of a taxi and walks through a landscaped garden towards a well-lit
text: restaurant. Expensive cars crowd the private parking lot. Guests come and go. The
text: restaurant appears to be popular. Ines has applied heavier make-up and is wearing
text: high-heeled shoes.
scene_heading: INT. - DA VINCI] LAKESIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Ines enters the lakeside restaurant in which she previously had dinner with
text: Henneberg. Two female FRONT OF HOUSE STAFF ask her for her reservation. The
text: restaurant's decor is clearly intended to exude an air of luxury. People sit at tables
text: or wait at the packed bar for their reservations: Foreign businesspeople mix with
text: rich Romanians clad in polo shirts and gold chains with their skinny girlfriends in
text: high heels. Ines spots two women who have already snagged bar stools: Tatjana
text: (38), the Dutchwoman we met at the embassy reception, and STEPH (45), an
dialog: American.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Hello. Sorry I’m late, but I had to get changed
dialog: after work.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: You look great...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Thanks you.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: You work way too much, Ines.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I know, but it’s really busy at the moment. I had a
dialog: big thing today...
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: Wow. How did it go?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: made a last-minute strategy change, but it went
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Did you check out the caterers? I gave her
dialog: Dariu’s number...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (to Tatjana)
dialog: ’m hosting a small party for my birthday. Next
dialog: Saturday. Are you free?
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: How nice...
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Dariu is the best.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (to Tatjana)
dialog: How was the night with the Chinese?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: (to Steph)
dialog: After 30 minutes they were drunk and I sat there
dialog: for five hours, listening to Mandarin. But I sold
dialog: one flat, at least.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: We were just fighting over who had the most
dialog: horrible weekend.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Oh, how was Naples?
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Short version: Naples is even dirtier than
dialog: Bucharest, and you can find much better Italian
text: food here in town. Even the kids were dying to
dialog: get back.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: They should bring us a drink.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Actually, your weekend sounds fun to me. I had
dialog: the most horrible weekend of my entire life.
text: Ines sinks her voice dramatically.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: My father visited me spontaneously, without any
text: warning. Out of nowhere, he was there, waiting
dialog: in my office. Pretending he wanted to bring me
dialog: my birthday present. But actually he was having
dialog: acrisis because his dog died.
text: Steph grimaces.
text: Ines nods.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: And Henneberg was there and wanted me to go
text: out with him and his wife the whole time.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Is Henneberg still in town? I should invite him to
dialog: our relaunch.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: And my father was sitting around making
dialog: spaghetti and trying to talk with me about the
dialog: meaning of life.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: That’s why I like Mondays.
text: Steph, too, has lost interest in Ines’ story.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: How is the new wife?
speaker_heading: INES
text: Very Russian, very skinny, very blond.
text: Ines looks around to make sure no one can hear her.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Better be careful.
text: An older man sitting next to Tatjana has a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket. He
text: adjusts it, then lifts the dripping bottle from the bucket and addresses the women.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Can I offer the ladies a glass of champagne?
text: Ines freezes as she recognizes the man. He has long, dark hair and the false teeth are
text: firmly in place. He just lisps slightly when he speaks. Tatjana looks questioningly at
dialog: her friends.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: Do we want champagne?
text: Tatjana looks at Steph and Ines.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Please, I can’t drink all this alone.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: Sure, why not...?
text: Toni beckons to the BARTENDER and asks for three glasses. Ines, who is standing
text: diagonally behind him, has stopped breathing. He’s wearing a dark blue iridescent
text: suit jacket with a striped pocket square - it used to be his handkerchief. Toni looks
text: at his watch and shakes his head. The teeth give him an outlandishly wild character.
text: There’s clearly something not entirely genuine about him but, overall, his outfit
dialog: somehow works.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I’m waiting for Mr. Tiriac for two hours now.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: lon Tiriac?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Yes. I’m Toni, Toni Erdmann.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: Tatjana... Nice to meet you, Toni.
text: He shakes hands with the women. For the first time, he makes direct eye contact
text: with Ines. Toni takes the chair next to Tatjana. The waiter brings the glasses with
dialog: the champagne.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: Do you work here in Bucharest, Toni?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Yes, and no. I came here because of a famous
dialog: dentist. He made all new. My teeth were too
dialog: small. And always I wanted something more
dialog: wild, more dangerous.
text: It’s clear that he’s inventing most of it on the spot. He smiles. Steph and Tatjana
dialog: aren’t sure whether to take the whole thing seriously.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Who is this crazy dentist?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: The International Dental Design Clinic.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: The doctor is Italian. Not a dentist. More an
dialog: Italian architect.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: So you are just friends with Tiriac?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: We played tennis together in Germany.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: Interesting.
text: Toni looks at his cellphone. Stuck to the back of it is a piece of paper with his own
dialog: phone number.
speaker_heading: TONI
text: But he not answers the phone. He has a crisis
dialog: because his...
dialog: (mixing German and English)
dialog: His Schildkréte died.
text: He looks at Ines. She realizes he heard what she said about him earlier.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: What's a “schillgréde”?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Aturtle.
speaker_heading: TONI
text: He is crying the whole day. The turtle was very
dialog: old. They spent 45 years together.
dialog: (again mixing German and English)
dialog: And then Herzinfarkt.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: Iam sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: For me, it’s just a turtle.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: May | ask what your profession is?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: My what?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in German, catching herself mid-
dialog: sentence and switching from the
dialog: familiar to the formal “you”)
dialog: Dein... Ihr Beruf (your profession).
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I’m a businessman, consultant and coach.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: What's your focus? If you say you’re into
dialog: coaching?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: My focus is life and style.
text: The waiter arrives and speaks to Toni. He points at a nearby table which is set for
text: one. On it is a plate with a large lobster. Winfried’s grocery bag hangs from the back
dialog: of the chair.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Do you want to finish it?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (again mixing German and English)
dialog: Oh yes... my Hummer is waiting.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: Or do you want to sit together?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Oh no, thank you.
text: The waiter points to an available table.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: So, your table is free, too.
text: The women say goodbye to Toni.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Thanks for the champagne.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: So nice meeting you... Toni.
text: They walk to their table. As soon as they’re out of earshot, Tatjana and Steph start
text: rolling their eyes.
speaker_heading: TATJANA (CONT’D)
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: These teeth...
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: And the thing with the turtle.
text: Ines shrugs.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Yeah, but some turtles can get really old.
text: They sit down and reach for the menus. Ines looks distractedly at Toni, who’s
text: inspecting the lobster through his reading glasses. Their eyes meet. He briefly raises
text: his glass of beer.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: (to Steph)
dialog: So who is coming to your relaunch?
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: It’s going to be a bizarre mix of guests. Gabriel
dialog: really invited everybody. New clients, possible
dialog: clients. Friends, supporters, all the people from
dialog: our charity work... He even wanted all the
dialog: drivers to be there.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: That's nice.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: I hope they don’t feel uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: So you rented the whole Players Club?
text: Steph nods. She, too, looks at Toni, who is now trying to suck the meat out of a
text: lobster leg through his teeth.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Oh, God... That’s really disgusting.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: What's disgusting?
speaker_heading: STEPH
text: Just the way he eats. He is definitely not waiting
dialog: for Tiriac.
text: For a moment, Ines seems to be annoyed by the way Steph’s talking about “her
dialog: father”.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: A lot of managers have strange gurus.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Yeah, maybe...
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: You never know...
text: Steph starts typing something on her cellphone. Part of her still wonders whether
text: Toni really might be someone important. Ines watches as an UNKNOWN MAN
text: wearing a suit and a bowtie approaches Toni’s table. Toni looks at his watch and
text: invites him to sit down, but the man wants to leave. Toni struggles with the lobster
text: for another moment, then gestures at the waiter to bring the check. Ines’ and
text: Tatjana’s starters arrive. Toni stands up and raps his knuckles on the women’s table
dialog: (a departing gesture in Germany).
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (mixing English and German)
dialog: Ich muss... My limousine waits.
dialog: (in German)
dialog: It was very nice to meet you.
text: He looks at Ines as he says it. Steph quickly whips out a business card and hands it
text: with professional nonchalance to Toni.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: My husband runs a headhunting company. If
dialog: there is anything we can do for you or Mr. Tiriac,
dialog: we would be happy to.
text: Toni gratefully takes the card. Steph waits for him to reciprocate, but he doesn’t. He
text: leaves. Tatjana laughs at Steph.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: You are really a pro...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Ines stands and picks up her handbag as if she’s going to the bathroom.
scene_heading: EXT. - DA VINCI] RESTAURANT - EXIT AREA - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Ines walks to the restaurant’s busy exit and stands hesitantly in the entrance area. A
text: white stretch limo is parked in the lot. Toni stands next to it, undecided. Ines
text: retreats behind a glass screen and watches as her father looks towards the
text: restaurant. Then he pats the driver on the shoulder and really does climb into the
text: limo. She steps out of the restaurant and watches him leave.
scene_heading: INT. - DA VINCI] LAKESIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Ines walks back to her table. The waiter arrives and brings her a rich chocolate cake
text: decorated with lit sparklers. She turns it down, because she didn’t order it.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: It’s from the man who just left. He told me to
dialog: send his dessert to you.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: It seems like you have an admirer, Ines.
text: Even though she’s being ironic, Tatjana still seems to be irritated that the dessert is
text: intended for Ines. Steph receives an SMS.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Shit, he didn’t give me his card. Gabriel just
dialog: texted.
dialog: (quoting the message)
dialog: “Tiriac! Cool!” He wanted to invite him to the
dialog: party.
text: Suddenly, Ines starts eagerly eating the chocolate cake.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Ines cautiously opens her apartment door, as if there might be someone inside. She
text: looks into all of the rooms. She walks around, unsettled. She dials her father’s
text: number again, but he doesn’t pick up. She carefully opens a closet. The apartment is
text: empty.
scene_heading: INT. - OFFICE BUILDING - MEETING ROOM - DAY
text: It’s early morning. Ines has retreated into a glass-walled meeting room and is
text: Skyping with a middle-aged man who seems to be some kind of COACH. He’s having
text: breakfast on the terrace of some lakeside hotel.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: The speaking went well. It doesn’t need any
dialog: more work. I made good use of the space. I spent
text: time in the room beforehand, too.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: And what about the breathing technique?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I didn’t need it this time. But I would like to do
dialog: some more work on my body language.
dialog: Sometimes I lose control of it...
text: A woman flits across the screen. The coach murmurs to her that he’ll be with her
dialog: shortly.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Do you have an example?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: It tends to be when I’m listening.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: I suspect you're really listening in those
dialog: moments. That’s noble, of course, but maybe you
dialog: need to focus more on your own message. Did
dialog: anything surprise you?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Not in terms of the content... But maybe the
dialog: tone... Dascalu argued very aggressively.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Did it affect you on a personal level?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: It might have done.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Maybe there’s some kind of imbalance with
dialog: regard to your identification. You’re only good
dialog: when you identify yourself. Identification is an
dialog: important tool for you. But it’s a tool that you
dialog: need to be able to set aside.
text: Gerald knocks on the glass door. He gestures at Ines that he’s in a hurry, then enters
text: the room. He knows the man she’s Skyping with and waves briefly at the screen.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Can I grab you for a second?
scene_heading: EXT. - OFFICE BUILDING - ROOF TERRACE - DAY
text: Gerald and Ines walk across the office building’s broad roof terrace. They pass a
text: seating area set in a small, artificially-landscaped garden.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Ihave the feeling the team isn’t so tight anymore.
dialog: Tim thought the same. Think of something to
dialog: boost the team spirit... to prevent a gulf opening
dialog: up between the Romanians and us. They’ve lost
dialog: their morale, somehow.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yeah, I thought so, too. That corresponds with
dialog: my impression. I’m holding a brunch for my
dialog: birthday, anyway, so I’ll invite everyone then.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Very nice, something personal. Good.
text: Gerald walks away from the building, as if he’s purposefully looking for a secluded
dialog: spot.
speaker_heading: GERALD (CONT’D)
dialog: We'll work with the numbers we have and won’t
text: make a fuss about them.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Your idea of building up pressure through
dialog: Dascalu backfired. He and Illiescu won't be
dialog: discussing our project.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: OK. Why not?
speaker_heading: GERALD
text: Dascalu trusts Illiescu and sees no need to act.
dialog: And Henneberg wants to keep Dascalu out of it
dialog: so he can negotiate with the unions.
text: Suddenly, Ines notices as her father, or rather Toni, appears some distance away
text: and walks towards her holding a cup of coffee and a newspaper.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: So on what basis should I continue my work?
dialog: The transport data is all wrong. Many more
dialog: people work there. You can’t cut enough staff
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Everyone agrees with you on that one. The good
dialog: news is: Henneberg wants you to do the radical
dialog: cut.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: But that was totally unfounded. Surely you
text: realized it was all on the verge of speculation.
dialog: Above all, to sell such a big restructuring, now I
dialog: really do need precise figures.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: This will annoy the feminist in you. But, to quote
dialog: Henneberg: “Ms. Conradi has enough charm to
dialog: manage Illiescu by herself.”
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I’m not a feminist, Gerald. Otherwise I wouldn’t
dialog: tolerate guys like you.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: I'll take that as a compliment.
text: Ines watches tensely as Toni comes closer. He holds his cellphone to his ear. He’s
text: wearing the same iridescent jacket.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (quietly, into phone)
dialog: Mom, I’m working here. I can’t talk to you on the
dialog: phone the whole time. Yes, I’m taking my meds.
dialog: And fruit. Yeah, bye.
text: He puts the newspaper down ona bench opposite him and hides something
text: underneath it. Then he sits down on the paper, apparently by chance. Nothing
text: happens. Gerald looks at him with bemusement, but then continues.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: By the way, Henneberg wants to keep you here.
dialog: He really believes in you.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: And what did you say to him?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: That I'd talk to you. But that I think you'll finish
dialog: the project.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: And our deal?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: I know, of course. But we’re talking one year
dialog: max. Then you can start at a whole new level in
dialog: Shanghai or somewhere else.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I’ve heard that a few times before. I can manage
dialog: Bucharest just as well from Shanghai.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: That’s not realistic. This is your partner case.
dialog: Then you can choose where you want to go.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Can we continue this conversation somewhere
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: The alternative would be to hand over to Tim.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Right.
text: In the background, Toni sits down again on the suspicious newspaper, and an
text: unnaturally drawn-out farting noise is heard. Dissatisfied, Toni stands up and does
text: something underneath the newspaper.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: That wasn’t funny, though.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I'll think about it. Now I'd just like a coffee. Can
dialog: we maybe go back inside?
text: Ines is about to leave when Toni addresses her.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (to Ines)
dialog: I was just wondering where we met? What are
dialog: you doing here?
text: With Gerald there, Ines has no choice but to answer.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I work here. We're discussing something. We're
text: about to have a meeting.
text: Ines walks towards the building. Toni walks alongside them.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Ihave to go inside, too. I’m about to havea
text: supervision with Mr. Henneberg.
text: They pause at the entrance to the building.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Ines)
dialog: I hope he’s a bit less stubborn today. He’s
text: unbelievably frightened of the Romanians and
text: worried that his wife spends too much money.
text: Ines tries to laugh. Gerald looks expectantly at her, waiting for her to introduce him
text: to Toni, but she doesn’t.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Marburger.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Erdmann. Do you use hand lotion?
text: Gerald shakes his head, bewildered.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: Then it’s probably me.
dialog: Ines owes Gerald an explanation of who this guy is.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Mr. Erdmann is... a freelance coach.
text: Gerald is still bemused, but it seems to be an explanation.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: So I'll be in touch with you again later, about
dialog: the... workshop.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: (to Ines)
dialog: Aworkshop for us?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes, it’s being considered. The idea was floated...
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (in German-inflected English)
dialog: We see. If you willing?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Willing? You are willing?
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Oh, let’s drop the English. It’s not going so well
dialog: today, after all.
text: Again, Ines tries to take control of the situation.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: That came from Dacoil. It still needs to be
dialog: discussed.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Yes, | invented a program together with Lothar
dialog: Matthaus. Title: “Shoes and Belt should fit
dialog: together”.
text: Ines gives Tonia firm and decisive handshake.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Goodbye.
scene_heading: INT. - OFFICE BUILDING - BY ELEVATOR NEAR ROOF TERRACE - DAY
text: Ines walks so speedily to the elevator that Gerald has to hurry to keep up.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: What kind of a freak is that?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I'll explain when we have more time.
text: The elevator arrives and Gerald steps into it. Ines turns around and takes her
text: cellphone from her bag, as if it’s ringing.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be there in a minute.
scene_heading: EXT. - OFFICE BUILDING - ROOF TERRACE - DAY
text: Ines runs back and looks out onto the roof terrace. Toni is no longer there.
scene_heading: INT. - OFFICE BUILDING - BY ELEVATOR NEAR ROOF TERRACE - DAY
text: Ines runs through a series of corridors, searching. Company employees walk pass
text: her. She spots Toni, stops him just before he gets into an elevator and forces him
text: into a corner. Winfried immediately adopts his Toni pose and quickly puts in his
dialog: false teeth.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Listen, are you insane? Are you trying to ruin me
dialog: or what? Dad, I’m talking to you.
text: Toni looks down and, for a moment, it seems like he might relent, but then he fishes
text: a business card from his jacket. He puts on his sunglasses.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Well, if this is about your father, I’m not the right
dialog: man. But if you want to work on your charisma,
dialog: or if you notice you're talking to no-one on the
dialog: phone, you’re welcome to contact me at any
dialog: time.
text: Before Ines can say anything, he turns around and gestures at a MAN ina suit who’s
text: getting into the elevator.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, there’s my man.
text: Toni greets the man and pats him on the shoulder. From the man’s reaction,
text: however, it’s clear that he has no idea who Toni is. The elevator doors close. Ines
text: looks at the hand-drawn business card. All it says is “T. E. - Toni Erdmann” and his
text: phone number. Employees walk pass her. Ines turns and walks back into the open-
dialog: plan office.
scene_heading: INT. - MARRIOTT HOTEL - STAIRCASE - DAY
text: Ines walks up the stairs in the Marriott Hotel. She’s wearing a tight-fitting dress and
text: has tied her hair up.
scene_heading: INT. - MARRIOTT HOTEL - CORRIDOR AND ENTRANCE TO ROOM - DAY
text: She continues along a broad corridor with a blue carpet. As she walks, she re-applies
text: her lipstick. She stops by a door, tiredly straightens up and knocks. Tim opens the
text: door. He’s shirtless and speaking on his cellphone.
scene_heading: INT. - MARRIOTT HOTEL - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Ines enters the room and puts down her bag. Tim comes over to her, kisses her and
text: pays her a silent compliment as he continues listening to someone on the phone.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: But a two-masted boat is a lot of work. I’m not
dialog: doing that with a five-man crew. You can forget
dialog: Daniel. He has to mix the cocktails. Yeah, send
text: some pics.
text: He finishes the conversation, puts his phone on silent and comes over to Ines, who
text: has flopped down on a couch in the spacious hotel room.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT’D)
dialog: This’ll be such a stupid sailing trip. Ludwig now
text: wants to take a two-masted boat.
text: He takes off one of Ines’ high-heeled shoes and starts massaging her foot. After a
text: brief moment, he guides her foot between his legs.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Oh, so the maid hasn’t come yet?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No. Only Timidri... Romanian lover for you.
text: Ines laughs. He kisses her and, if he had his way, he’d undress her right there and
text: then. There’s a knock at the door and a quiet voice says, “Room service”. Tim goes to
text: the door and opens it. A hotel employee carries in a cake stand and a bottle of white
text: wine. Tim puts the cake stand on the floor next to Ines and uncorks the bottle.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Wow...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Gerald found out about us, by the way.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: He told me not to fuck you too much so you don’t
dialog: lose your bite.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Aha.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: I told him that’s why I fuck you. And today I’m
dialog: going to sleep with you in every corner of this
dialog: room.
text: Tim comes over to Ines and tries to undress her. They kiss, but Ines suddenly isn’t in
dialog: the mood.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT’D)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I'll just watch you first... I’ll try to catch up.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hurry up, then.
text: Tim unfastens his pants and tries to undress Ines. She flops back onto the couch and
text: takes a gulp of her white wine.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I don’t want to lose my bite.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Come on, don't be so serious. I'll fuck you real
dialog: strong. My sperm has superpowers.
text: Ines can’t help but smile at his nonsense.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, my bite is really more important to me. I'd
dialog: rather just watch you.
text: Tim takes her foot and massages his crotch with it. Ines pulls it back. Tim grabs her
text: breasts, kisses her and tries to ignore the fact that she’s not joining in.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to try to hit one of the petit fours. Ill
dialog: eat it afterwards.
text: Ines can’t help but laugh. Tim is irritated, but too aroused to stop. He approaches
text: her again and kisses her, but she remains resolute and won’t let him undress her.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: You're being serious? Yeah, OK.
text: Tim starts pleasuring himself.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT’D)
dialog: And which one, exactly? OK, I’m going to come
dialog: now.
text: Tim drops to his knees in front of her, really does ejaculate over the cake stand and
text: then falls onto his back.
speaker_heading: TIM (CONT’D)
dialog: You're stupid.
text: Ines takes one of the dripping petit fours and bites into it. Tim looks at her in disgust
text: and pulls up his pants. He stands up and disappears into the bathroom. Ines stays
text: there, musing. She digs in her handbag for her cellphone and dials a number.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello Steph, it’s Ines. Sorry to disturb you, but
dialog: I’ve got the number of the Tiriac coach. Yeah, I
dialog: met him again. It’s up to you... but why not? Yes! I
dialog: am already getting dressed. I will text you. See
dialog: you later.
text: Tim returns. He sits down on the hotel bed with his laptop and starts scrolling
text: through Facebook. Ines flops down next to him.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Take a look at Gerald’s lady. What a mama. No
dialog: wonder he’s fucking his way around this place.
dialog: How can he be stupid enough to post photos of
dialog: himself barbecuing?
text: Tim clicks on a photo of Gerald, his wife and their two children. It’s a family
text: barbecue in front of a modern house with the table set, a dog and children’s toys
text: strewn across the garden.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Men can really have a lot of fun.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: How come? You fuck around, too.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yeah, but I don’t have a wife waiting for me
dialog: somewhere... buying these salads, getting my
text: kids dressed and taking our dog to the vet.
text: Tim takes a closer look at the photo and spots the dog. One of its paws is bandaged.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: He just has this house somewhere and he can
dialog: always go there. Look closely... Have you ever
dialog: seen him looking like that here?
speaker_heading: TIM
text: I think he looks frustrated.
text: Gerald’s facial features are like the Mona Lisa’s. It’s difficult to say whether he looks
text: serious or is smiling.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Let’s get going...
scene_heading: EXT. - CLUB - OUTDOOR AREA - NIGHT
text: The outdoor area of a nightclub. A pool is illuminated with kitschy lights and
text: surrounded by curved seating areas, fake palm trees and pseudo-Greek frescoes.
text: The reception is already busy. Aperitifs are being served. Tatjana’s husband’s
text: headhunting company seems to be throwing money around. Ines and Tim greet
text: Tatjana and a couple of people we don’t yet know. In the background, the hosts are
text: being photographed with their guests in front of a curved backdrop. Ines looks
text: around. Suddenly she spots her father or, rather, Toni. He takes a beer from a tray
text: and also looks around. When he spies Ines, he raises his glass to her from afar. From
text: a bar table, he takes a bowl of nuts and empties it into his jacket pocket. Ines pulls
text: herself together and approaches him.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Hello, Mr. Erdmann.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Good evening.
text: Suddenly, both fall silent. Toni gives Ines a couple of nuts from his jacket pocket. She
dialog: takes them.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: So, have you calmed down a bit?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Is Tiriac still coming?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: He said he was, yes. But today was the funeral...
dialog: for Angelina.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: His turtle.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Exactly.
text: Tim looks over at them.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: Am I supposed to do something in particular
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I wanted to give you a bigger audience...
text: Tim strolls over to them with a drink for Ines. He clearly feels obliged to rescue Ines
dialog: from her current conversation.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (to Ines)
dialog: Let’s do it this way: If you say “Rocky”, I’ll hit
dialog: him.
text: Toni shakes hands with Tim.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: Erdmann, pleased to meet you.
text: Toni pulls his hand away as if in pain.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Everything OK?
text: Tim laughs and Toni pats him on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Friends, right?
text: Toni offers Tim a couple of nuts from his jacket pocket, and Tim takes them. From
text: the way Tim positions himself next to Ines and briefly puts his hand on her back,
text: Toni realizes that they have more than a professional relationship.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: And what do your parents do for a living?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: We have a car dealership. BMWs.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: And do you call home now and again?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Ah, yes.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: That’s good. You get another nut for that. Only
dialog: one. I need to save the other one for Mr.
dialog: Marburger.
text: Toni gestures towards Gerald, who appears in the background with two women.
text: Ines stands up straight. One of the women is the receptionist from the office lobby.
text: Tim bemusedly takes a second nut from Toni’s hand.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: You can learn a lot from your parents. For
dialog: example, I learned from my father how to use a
dialog: cheese grater. We pass this down from
dialog: generation to generation.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Is it a special cheese grater?
text: Tim, who is practiced in smalltalk, is trying to take his conversational partner
dialog: seriously.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: No, no, a very ordinary little cheese grater.
dialog: Question is: How you hold the cheese, the speed
dialog: at which you grate.
text: Tim can’t help but laugh.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t believe me, then.
dialog: (to Ines)
dialog: Do you like grating cheese?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Sadly, I don’t have the time.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Yes, you have to be incredibly relaxed to handle a
dialog: cheese grater right. Tense people often have
dialog: difficulties.
text: He mimes a tense hand.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (to Tim)
dialog: Mr. Erdmann is a freelance coach. We met
dialog: through his work with Henneberg.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: OK.
text: Gerald strolls over to them with two young Romanian women. He greets Tim and
dialog: Ines.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: They’re putting on quite a show here...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: No expense spared.
text: Toni greets Gerald as if they know each other, and Tim stares at them. Ines allows
text: the situation to continue. Toni taps the knot in Gerald’s necktie. Suddenly, Ines sees
text: Natalja. She quickly turns to Gerald.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Is Henneberg still here?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Yeah, yeah. We just had dinner.
text: At that moment, Ines spots Henneberg. Accompanied by Steph, he’s moving in their
text: direction while shaking hands with a few guests. Toni follows her gaze and, for a
text: moment, he shrinks back to Winfried size.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Hopefully he won’t drink so much today.
text: Then he sets off, deliberately walking towards Henneberg and patting him on the
text: shoulder as he passes. At first, the executive doesn’t recognize Winfried at all. Toni
text: mutters to him.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m here incognito today.
text: Henneberg reacts confused.
speaker_heading: HENNEBERG
dialog: Oh, right.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: We'll speak tomorrow.
text: He grips Henneberg’s neck. Gerald and Tim watch the interaction closely. As she
text: passes him, Steph speaks to Toni.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: You have to meet my husband.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Yes, I just have to call my mother.
text: Ines takes another glass from a WAITER and turns away to avoid Natalja and
text: Henneberg. Toni walks on and ends up next to two women (ANA and FLAVIA) who
text: are struggling to hold their champagne glasses and eat from their plates. Toni
text: spontaneously takes the plates from them. The women laugh and try to take the
text: plates back. Toni looks at Ines, who’s watching him from a distance. While Toni
text: holds the plates, he exchanges business cards with the women. Toni glances
text: towards Ines again. Tim is bobbing around her, ready to party. Tatjana approaches
dialog: them both.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: Car party?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Absolutely...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in German)
dialog: I’m not sure. I'll come later.
dialog: (in English)
dialog: I will join you in a minute...
text: Ines walks over to Toni, who’s still holding the women’s plates. He gestures
text: encouragingly at some remaining salad.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (to Ines, in German)
dialog: I was just learning a bit about Romanian
dialog: traditions.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Mr. Erdmann, we're going to the club and would
dialog: love you to join us.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: And which embassy do you work at?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (to Ines, in German)
dialog: Translation, please.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (bemused, in German)
dialog: In which embassy you work.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (in German)
dialog: In the German one...
dialog: (to Flavia)
dialog: In the German. I am Ambassador Erdmann... and
dialog: this is my secretary, Ms. Schnuck.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: I work in the parliament. I am something like a
dialog: secretary too.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Romania has a parliament? I didn’t know that.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: Sometimes it feels like this.
text: Ines looks over at Tatjana and Tim, who are leaving the club. Toni stacks the
text: women’s empty plates on top of each other.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Je voudrais... excusé.
text: He pronounces it like “I have to go”. Flavia and her friend Ana nod. Toni gives them
text: one of his business cards and gets one from Flavia in return. Ines has already walked
text: a couple of meters away. Steph passes her and, playing the hostess, touches her
text: shoulder briefly.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: On telephone a causa des oeufs!
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: You just told them you'll call them about the
dialog: eggs.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: That's exactly right.
scene_heading: EXT. - OUTSIDE THE CLUB - NIGHT
text: Toni and Ines leave the poolside area and walk down a set of steps towards a
text: parking lot surrounded by nature. Toni follows a little behind Ines. Ines looks
text: around, looking for something, and Toni follows her without knowing where they’re
text: going. They approach an SUV which is parked at the edge of a small forest. Tatjana
text: and Tim are already waiting there.
scene_heading: EXT. - PARKING LOT OUTSIDE CLUB - NIGHT
text: The distant boom of a bass line competes with the chirping of crickets. The club is
text: like a UFO landed in a wasteland. Where the parking lot ends, dense undergrowth
text: begins. Tatjana has opened the doors to her dark-colored SUV with its light-colored
text: seats and, for a moment, a question hangs in the air: What happens next?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (quietly, to Ines)
dialog: What are you doing with that guy?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I think it’s fun.
text: Toni sits down on the back seat of the car, in the open door. Tatjana silently
text: questions Ines. Ines nods, and Tatjana starts preparing cocaine on a city map. She
text: snorts a line then hands the map to Tim. After Tim has snorted his line, it’s Ines’
text: turn, but she first offers it to Toni. He declines.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Thanks. My heart...
text: Ines quickly snorts her line. Toni looks at the scenery. For a moment, everyone
text: stands around, wrinkling their itchy noses and waiting for the drug to take effect.
text: Tatjana starts putting make-up on. Toni points to some leftover cocaine that Ines
text: has missed. She doesn’t want to scrape it up, so he dips his finger in it briefly and
text: rubs the cocaine into his gums.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (to Tim)
dialog: I told him you’re looking for a coach.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Sure, I have so many problems with my boss, and
dialog: I'd like to become more successful with women.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: You can’t even pay for that.
text: Toni points at an imaginary spot on Tim’s shirt. Tim looks down and, at that
text: moment, Toni taps him on the nose.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Haha.
text: A moment later, Toni does the same thing again, and Tim can only laugh half as
text: much. Ines has now also started applying make-up. Toni reaches into his jacket
text: pocket and pulls out a new little cheese grater and a piece of parmesan. He grates a
text: little cheese onto his head. He shakes himself. Tim laughs bemusedly.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: So, time to go inside, you make-up babes! I’m a
dialog: public official. I don’t want to get arrested here.
text: As Toni walks past Tim, he once again taps his shirt and then his nose. This time, it
text: seems more like an attack.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Enough already!
scene_heading: EXT. - OUTSIDE THE CLUB - NIGHT
text: The group walks back towards the club. Toni walks next to Tim.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (quieter)
dialog: How are your bowel movements at the moment?
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: What does it have to do with you?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I work a lot with bowel movements. It’s like
text: reading tea leaves.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Creamy.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: That’s good. This morning, mine glittered like
dialog: gold.
text: He pats Tim on the shoulder. They walk up some steps covered ina red carpet. The
text: bass gets steadily louder, guiding them into the club - the venue’s indoor section. It
text: becomes clear that the poolside area where the reception was being held was
text: merely the outdoor section.
scene_heading: INT. - CLUB - DISCO - NIGHT
text: The club that now reveals itself is several times larger than the outdoor area. It has
text: an aggressive lightshow, dancers, kitschy decor: It’s the kind of club you only find in
text: Eastern Europe. They're led to a plush seating area next to a runway. A couple of
text: other guests from the reception are already sitting in this VIP area. Tim takes a
text: bottle of vodka from an ice bucket and starts pouring. The dance version of Bob
text: Marley's “No Woman, No Cry” booms from the loudspeakers. The lightshow gets
text: more dramatic and the room goes pitch dark apart from a few laser beams which
text: shoot aggressively through the darkness. Tatjana shrieks and Ines whistles cooly
text: through her fingers. They seem to know what's about to happen. A dwarf climbs out
text: of an oversized cake, carrying a larger-than-life lollipop on his shoulders. He’s
text: followed by a line of dancers whose legs appear even longer in his presence. Tim
text: pulls out his iPhone and starts filming. The dwarf whips the crowd into a frenzy and
text: the new girls start dancing. The old dancers disappear into the cake. Ines pours
text: vodka for Toni as if she’s challenging him.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Everything OK?
text: Toni shrugs and tries to seem unfazed. Gerald arrives at the VIP area with the
text: receptionist and another woman. He makes a “party” gesture towards Ines, and she
text: reciprocates. Her movements are self-conscious. Toni observes her from the side.
text: She’s like a stranger to him. Tim films Ines. She shifts closer to Toni and makes a
text: “victory” sign. Toni copies her. Ines laughs into the camera as if she’s posing with an
text: amusing animal. Everyone starts dancing. Ines looks at Toni. She knows she’s
text: showing her father something that’s new to him. Toni starts to move. For a moment,
text: he seems young and agile. He copies the others’ movements, but the irony falls flat
text: in the midst of the overall excess.
scene_heading: INT. - CLUB - DISCO - NIGHT
text: The VIP lounge has now filled up. Tatjana, Tim and Ines are still bobbing around the
text: champagne bucket. The dancers on the stage make acrobatic movements. The show
text: has become more lavish. A WAITER arrives with a fresh bottle of champagne.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I'll pay for that.
text: The waiter produces an electronic card reader and Toni rummages for his credit
text: card in his tattered leather wallet. Tim starts tearing paper napkins from a holder
text: and throwing them in the air. Tatjana demands that he unbutton his shirt further.
speaker_heading: TATJANA
dialog: It’s unfair. Only women and a Lilliputian.
text: Tim briefly fends her off, then starts to enjoy showing off his six-pack. A new song
text: starts. Toni sits down on one of the sofas and wipes sweat from his forehead with
text: his handkerchief. He watches his daughter. He doesn’t recognize her. Tim has
text: grabbed the champagne bottle and is holding it between his legs while he dances
text: from glass to glass. He comes to Toni, who lets him “pee” into his glass. Tim watches
text: as Toni re-inserts his false teeth and stands up. Toni pulls out the cheese grater and
text: starts to “help” Tim by grating cheese into the champagne. Tatjana pulls her glass
text: away. Ines topples, swaying, onto one of the plush sofas. Only now do we realize
text: how drunk she is: The effect of the cocaine has worn off. Tim dances onwards to
text: Ines, who suddenly seems very distant. Toni grates a little cheese onto her hair. Tim
text: approaches and dances around with the bottle at her mouth. Ines digs in her
text: handbag and takes out two pills. Tim wants her to open her mouth and wash down
text: the pills with champagne. She pushes the neck of the bottle away. The joke’s going
text: down so well that Tim carries on. He starts to mime an orgasm.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: It’s a really expensive vintage.
text: Toni grabs the bottle from his hand.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: That’s enough now.
text: Ines stands up, swaying.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (to Tim)
dialog: I’m going. I have to go to Buzau tomorrow.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Come on, stay here a while longer. It was just a
dialog: joke. Should I come with you?
text: Ines weakly raises her hand in farewell and then swiftly disappears into the crowd.
text: It takes Tonia moment to realize she’s gone.
scene_heading: EXT. - OUTSIDE THE CLUB - NIGHT
text: Toni runs hurriedly out of the club. Outside, several taxis are waiting. Party guests
text: are still coming and going. Toni spots Ines just as she’s getting into a taxi. The driver
text: holds the door open for her. She sways as she gets in. Toni runs towards her, but the
text: taxi pulls away. He, too, hurriedly looks for a taxi. He fishes a small piece of paper
text: from his wallet and gives it to the driver.
scene_heading: INT. - BUCHAREST - TAXI - NIGHT
text: The taxi travels swiftly through night-time Bucharest. Wide, empty avenues are
text: flanked by imposing socialist-era buildings from which huge, illuminated
text: advertising billboards shine. Toni sits in the back seat and looks out of the window.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. - STREET IN FRONT OF WINFRIED’S HOTEL - TAXI - DAWN
text: The taxi pulls up on a broad street in front of a hotel. It’s already getting light. Toni
text: gets out and walks towards the building. A few people are already making their way
text: to work. He takes out the false teeth and puts them in his pocket.
scene_heading: INT. - WINFRIED’S HOTEL - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Winfried stands in a small hotel room. His things are lying on the unused half of a
text: double bed. He stands there for a moment, bewildered, then he leaves the hotel
dialog: again.
scene_heading: EXT. - BUCHAREST STREETS - DAY
text: It’s morning in Bucharest. Winfried walks through the city. He seems uncertain
text: about what he should do. He takes his phone from his pocket and dials a number.
text: No-one picks up. He watches as commuters get onto buses.
scene_heading: EXT. - STREET BY BAKERY - DAY
text: Winfried stops by a bakery which sells its wares through a glass window. He joins
text: the line and points at a couple of soft pretzels. Then he sits down in a doorway and
text: eats. Once again, he takes his phone from his pocket and dials. No-one picks up. An
text: elderly woman passes by and begs at him. Winfried quickly stands up.
scene_heading: EXT. - STREET IN FRONT OF INES’ APARTMENT - DAY
text: Winfried turns onto Ines’ street.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT BLOCK - STAIRWELL - DAY
text: Winfried, now half-Toni, stands with a bag from the bakery in the darkened
text: stairwell in front of Ines’ door. He hesitantly rings the bell. She doesn’t answer. He
text: rings again and listens. He pulls Ines’ apartment key from his pocket and unlocks the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - DAY
text: It’s quiet in the apartment. He peers into Ines’ bedroom - the bed is empty.
text: Suddenly, he hears a noise from the bathroom. He opens the door of a large, built-in
text: closet in the hallway and wedges himself in, still holding the bag from the bakery.
text: Ines exits the bathroom. She’s wearing her work clothes again. She walks past the
text: closet, notices that the door is slightly ajar and tries to close it. Something’s in the
text: way. She opens the closet and screams in mortal terror as she sees there’s a person
text: inside. Toni peels himself out of the closet. He is wearing his teeth but not the wig.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Sorry, I was just checking in on you.
text: Ines gasps for air. She’s speechless. She runs at him and hits him with all her
text: strength. He lets her do it for a moment, then she flees into the kitchen. Ines tries to
text: calm herself down, but Toni follows her. She reaches into a pot and throws the
text: remains of the old, leftover spaghetti at Toni. Suddenly, Toni springs forward, grabs
text: Ines’ wrist and fastens a handcuff to it.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Ms. Conradi, you're under arrest.
text: They’re now chained together. Ines tugs and pulls at her hand, then, very suddenly,
text: she changes tack.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Open them up, please. I have an appointment. I’m
text: about to be picked up.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: It’s too risky.
text: Toni takes his handkerchief from his pants pocket and wipes the sweat from his
text: forehead. He sits down on a chair and Ines has no choice but to go with him. He
text: stalls a little longer, then reaches into his pocket to get the key. He searches but can’t
text: find it. He carries on rummaging in his pockets.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t have the key.
text: Ines stares at him. He looks at the handcuffs and confirms that they really are
dialog: locked.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Open them up right now.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I really can’t find it.
text: Ines looks down at herself. She’s not fully dressed and her hair is wet. She walks
text: away, pulling on the handcuffs. Toni has to hurry to keep up with her and, suddenly,
text: he seems like her captive.
scene_heading: EXT. - STREET IN FRONT OF INES’ APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY
text: Still handcuffed together, Ines and Toni leave the house. Bogdan, the driver, is
dialog: waiting for them.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Bogdan, my father made a stupid joke. We have
dialog: to solve this problem.
text: Bogdan looks at the handcuffs and then nods. Ines gets into the car. Toni refuses.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Iam not her father, but OK. Where are you
dialog: bringing me?
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ CAR - STREET NEAR MARKET - DAY
text: Toni and Ines sit on the back seat of the comfortable S-class car as Bogdan drives
text: them out of the city. Ines tries to ignore Toni. Both are still visibly feeling the effects
text: of the previous night. Even though their hands are so close together, they’re making
text: an effort not to touch. The traffic edges tightly past run-down housing blocks.
scene_heading: EXT. - BUCHAREST MARKET - DAY
text: Ines and Toni follow Bogdan through the darkened halls of a sprawling market. Toni
text: looks around, but Ines forces him to hurry up. At a stand selling household goods, a
text: young ROMANIAN wearing a hoodie comes to their aid. Discreetly and with
text: confident movements, he separates the handcuffs. Toni screams. The Romanian
text: laughs. Bogdan gives him some money.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ CAR - FREEWAY - DAY
text: Using tape from the first-aid kit, Ines sticks the handcuff to her arm so it’s not visible
text: under her blazer. Toni looks out of the window. The car hurtles along a freeway. The
text: landscape is flat and empty. In the distance, an industrial area is visible. Cattle stand
text: under hoardings advertising German companies. Ines closes her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ CAR - RURAL AREA - DAY
text: The landscape has changed. Ines is asleep. It’s a poor, rural region. They drive across
text: a bridge and overtake a horse-drawn cart. Toni looks at it as they pass. The car turns
text: onto an unpaved road. Bogdan turns around towards the back seat.
speaker_heading: BOGDAN
dialog: (to Toni)
dialog: Please wake her up...
text: Ines wakes up immediately and starts applying make-up.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. - INES’ CAR - IN FRONT OF OILFIELD OFFICE - DAY
text: The car passes through a security checkpoint and drives into a fenced-off area. They
text: pull up in front of the main building of an oilfield installation. Ines gets out. Toni
text: stretches, planning to stay in the car. Ines looks tensely at the building.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Come with me. Take that off...
text: Toni puts the toupee in his bag and follows her.
scene_heading: INT. - OILFIELD - LOBBY - ILLIESCU’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Ines and Toni enter an office lobby. Ines greets a SECRETARY.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Good morning. Conradi from Morrisons...
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Please wait a minute...
text: The secretary disappears and a moment later she opens the door to a large office.
text: Ines ushers Toni in ahead of her.
scene_heading: INT. - OILFIELD - ILLIESCU’S OFFICE - DAY
text: The office is spacious and some effort has been made to mask the fact that it’s in the
text: sticks. Toni has no choice but to follow Ines. ILLIESCU, a Romanian manager aged
text: around 50, greets Ines. He’s surprised to see she’s arrived with company. Ines
text: introduces him to Toni.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Mr. Iliescu, Mr. Erdmann.
text: The two men shake hands.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: lam sorry for not getting in touch with you
text: earlier. Mr. Erdmann just joined NWG and as he
text: is on a visit together with Mr. Henneberg he
dialog: wanted to get a personal impression of our
dialog: project...
text: Ines looks at Toni, who has no choice but to nod. The secretary puts a couple of cans
text: of cola down on the table. In his short-sleeved shirt, Illiescu seems more like a labor
text: union type. As an adversary, he’s difficult to read: He and Ines come from different
dialog: worlds.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Erdmann implemented a similar project in
dialog: one of the major Russian oil companies...
text: Toni nods at Illiescu and starts to feel his way into his role. He leans back.
speaker_heading: ILLESICU
dialog: So, please have a seat. How can I help you?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: He just wants to listen... get a feeling for how we
dialog: work together on this project...
text: Ines takes some out some papers and lays them in front of Iliescu.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: So, first of all, | am looking forward that the
dialog: project is going to continue...
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: So amI,soamI...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: And that we will work together much closer than
dialog: we have so far.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: Which is a pleasure...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: As you know, I presented your figures in our last
dialog: steering committee. Unfortunately, a lot of
dialog: questions came up about some of the data you
dialog: provided.
text: She looks at Toni, seeking his agreement. He nods.

speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: I’m surprised to hear that there are problems.
dialog: Mr. Tamaric is in Bucharest today.
text: Every now and again, Illiescu looks at Toni. He is equally unable to read him. Ines’
text: polished self-presentation is also something he doesn’t encounter every day. Toni
text: senses that Illiescu is being put under pressure. The more he grasps the situation,
text: the more uncomfortable he, too, feels.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: It doesn’t matter. | wanted to talk to you
dialog: personally. It’s a complicated business case.
dialog: Because of that we have to decide if you have the
dialog: capacity to work closer with us. Or, if you prefer,
dialog: we can send some of our consultants to work
dialog: here in your office.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: No, I don’t think that is necessary.
text: Ines turns to Toni.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I'd also prefer to try it this way, Mr. Erdmann.
dialog: Mr. Illiescu and I have known each other for
dialog: some time now, and | think we will find a very
dialog: good solution.
text: She’s acting as if it's Toni who’s been piling on the pressure, and she’s now the one
text: defending their collaboration with Illiescu. For a moment, no-one speaks...
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (in German)
dialog: OK. If you think so.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: Just tell me what you need.
text: He looks more closely at the list.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: We particularly need the monthly personnel
dialog: costs in logistics by the end of next week. Plus,
dialog: we should think about doing a new future
dialog: manpower plan.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: Ihave to check... 1 don’t know why you don’t

speaker_heading: INES

speaker_heading: ILLIESCU

speaker_heading: INES

scene_heading: INT. - ILLIESCU’S CAR - VILLAGE STREET NEAR OILFIELD - DAY
text: Toni sits next to Illiescu in his spacious company SUV. The car drives through a
text: village, turns onto an unpaved road and slowly struggles up the hill. The landscape
text: becomes more barren. There are houses, a graveyard and an old orthodox church;
text: Behind them, oil pumps appear. The oilfield extends right to the edge of the village.
scene_heading: INT. - ILLIESCU’S CAR - ROAD TO OILFIELD BOREHOLE - DAY
text: The car drives slowly across the rough terrain. Goats walk around between the oil
text: pumps. Toni looks out of the window.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Same like in Russia.
text: Outside, a chaotic array of oil pumps stretches as far as the eye can see. The drilling
text: seems like an infestation of the otherwise beautiful, hilly landscape. Iliescu makes a
text: detour to take them past a new oil pump.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: This is one of our newest pumps.
text: Toni nods. Illiescu pulls up in front of a small hut. Filthy dogs lie in the shade. Two
text: sunburned SECURITY GUARDS come outside. [Iliescu rolls down his window and
text: shakes hands with them.
speaker_heading: ILLESICU
dialog: (in Romanian)
dialog: Alo, alo! Avem nevoie de casti. Avem ceva
dialog: musafiri de la Bucuresti. (Hello. We need hard
dialog: hats. We have guests from Bucharest.)
text: Hard hats are passed into the car and Illiescu drives onwards towards a borehole.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: This is a part of our maintenance crew. We are
dialog: closing this drilling site...
scene_heading: EXT. - OILFIELD - BOREHOLE - DAY
text: A GROUP OF WORKERS is in the middle of repairing some part of a pump. Ines,
text: Iliescu and Toni get out of the car. A couple of the workers approach them, curious
text: about the visit. They seem to be glad of the change. Illiescu introduces Toni to a
text: WORKER who is clearly in charge of the operation. Again, the word “Bucharest” is
text: mentioned. Toni confidently shakes the man’s hand and straightens his hard hat.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: It’s the last of the drill holes that we will close...
dialog: We use an artificial lift system and hope to finish
dialog: it by the end of the week.
text: Illiescu seems to be seizing the opportunity to demonstrate the quality of their
text: maintenance work to Ines. Toni looks around and walks on towards the borehole.
text: For a moment, he jokingly inspects an old pipe that’s lying around, then he goes
text: back to trying to make a professional impression. Illiescu has followed him to see
text: what he’s so interested in. AWORKER is busy repairing something with his bare
text: hands. His lower arms are completely covered in oil. Toni shakes his head and
text: points at the worker.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: But this is not good.
text: Illiescu notices this right away, and angrily reprimands the worker.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: (in Romanian)
dialog: Unde-ti sunt manusile de protectie?! Asta nue

speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: Atunci sa faca altul, care poate. (Then let

text: The worker defends himself. Toni can’t understand the exchange.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (to Iliescu)
dialog: Please don’t fire him.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: I will, I will.
speaker_heading: TONI

speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: But I will.
dialog: (to the worker, in Romanian)

text: Toni turns to Ines.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Please, can you just tell him not to fire that man
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: That’s up to him. The more he fires, the fewer I

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Come on, that was pretty funny.
text: They look at each other.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (to Iliescu)
dialog: Please, it was just a joke.
speaker_heading: ILLESICU
dialog: But you are right. He knows our security

dialog: always wears gloves. I will take care of it...)
text: Ines watches Toni as he walks towards the car.
scene_heading: EXT. - OILFIELD - GARDEN - OUTSIDE HOUSE - DAY
text: Toni stands still next to the car. He is visibly exhausted. Some distance away, there’s
text: arickety garden fence. He glances at Ines and Illiescu who are standing at the
text: borehole, some distance away. He walks through a broken gate, looking for a place
text: to pee. This part of the property is overgrown. A sudden calm descends. Crickets
text: chirp. Just as Toni’s about to unfasten his pants, he hears a voice and turns around.
text: An ELDERLY MAN walks towards him and greets him in Romanian. Toni lifts his
text: arms apologetically. A TEENAGE BOY appears. The man gestures at Toni to go ahead
text: and pee. Winfried refuses.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: (in Romanian)
dialog: Haideti cu mine... Sunteti de la Dacoil? (Come
dialog: with me... Are you from Dacoil?)
text: Toni doesn’t understand him. The man beckons for Toni to follow him. They walk a
text: short distance further into a beautiful garden. Flowers bloom. A very modest house
text: appears. Parts of it are covered in tarpaulin and renovation work appears to have
text: ground to a halt. The man opens a door and beckons Toni inside. Toni follows him
text: up a small set of wooden steps.
scene_heading: INT. - OILFIELD - HOUSE - VESTIBULE - DAY
text: They’re standing in a small vestibule full of clothes and buckets in which food is
text: stored. Toni is about to walk further into the house when the man points to a toilet.
text: He hands Tonia roll of toilet paper, and Toni realizes what's on offer. On the lid of
text: the toilet is a picture of a tiger. Toni points at it and makes a hissing noise, as if the
text: tiger’s biting him. The man laughs. Toni nods gratefully and the man closes the door
text: behind him. Exhausted, Toni sits down on the toilet lid in the semi-darkness. It has a
text: seat, but it’s really just a pit latrine.
scene_heading: EXT. - OILFIELD - OUTSIDE HOUSE - GARDEN - DAY
text: Toni walks back through the garden to the fence, where the man now stands with
dialog: the boy, Iliescu and Ines.

dialog: Da, au venit pentru o modernizare. (Yes, they're

dialog: (in English, to Ines and Toni)
dialog: I said you are going to modernize everything.
text: The man nods respectfully at Ines and Toni. Toni pulls out his wallet and holds a
text: twenty-euro bill towards the man.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Only euros...
text: The man refuses: He doesn’t want to take the money. Winfried offers it to the
text: teenager, who quickly puts the bill away.
speaker_heading: TEENAGE BOY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: (in Romanian)
dialog: Adu-i niste mere... (Get him a few apples...)
text: The boy disappears. Illiescu turns to leave, but the man starts talking to him. He also

text: Illiescu abruptly tries to end the discussion and again turns to leave. The boy
text: returns with a bag full of apples and gives them to Winfried. One apple falls to the
text: ground and the man puts it in Winfried’s jacket pocket. Winfried laughs gratefully
text: and gives the man a quick, friendly pat on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Don't lose humor.
text: The man looks questioningly at Illiescu.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: Please translate.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU
dialog: Nu va pierdeti umorul... (Don’t lose your sense of
dialog: humor.)
dialog: (in English)
dialog: I translated.
text: When it’s repeated, the sentence suddenly just sounds empty. Ines is irritated by her
text: father’s philanthropy. The old man laughs, briefly revealing his few remaining teeth.
text: They walk back to the car.
speaker_heading: ILLIESCU (CONT’D)
dialog: We give him some money every month but he
text: still complains. He wants a pump on his land. He
dialog: doesn’t understand that we don’t need his
text: ground. This area is mostly empty.
text: Illiescu shrugs, not without regret.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ CAR - RURAL AREA - ROAD TO FREEWAY - DAY
text: Toni and Ines sit in the back seat of her car. They drive through villages that have
dialog: died out.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Don't lose your sense of humor. I couldn’t believe
dialog: you told them not to lose their sense of humor.
dialog: That’s really cruel.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It wasn’t about that. It was a nice encounter.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: He could really have used your teeth.
text: Ines opens the center console and takes out a beer. The car turns back onto the
text: freeway to Bucharest and accelerates.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: How can we modernize that whole place if you
dialog: pee your pants when only one of them is fired?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: With every step you take, I can tell you how
dialog: direct your economic connection is to these
dialog: people. Your pseudo-green attitude won't help
dialog: you there at all.
text: Ines takes a gulp of beer. Toni looks silently out of the window.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Take a short break, please.
text: He closes his eyes and after a moment he starts breathing very calmly. Suddenly,
text: Ines no longer seems sure about what she just said. She rips off the tape she was
text: using to hide the handcuff under her sleeve and leans back. She observes her father:
text: His hand, gently clenched in a fist, encloses the case for his reading glasses. It
text: already has some age spots. Ines slumps down and can no longer keep her eyes
dialog: open.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ CAR - ROAD TO FLAVIA’S HOUSE - DAY
text: The car drives through the outskirts of Bucharest. Apartment blocks alternate with
text: art nouveau buildings. The car turns onto a dark side street. Bogdan looks outside,
text: searching. He turns around to Toni, who’s also awake and looking out of the
text: window. He’s once again wearing the toupee with the long hair.
speaker_heading: BOGDAN
dialog: It’s here.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: OK. Thank you.
text: He gropes for his reading glasses and looks at a business card. Ines is sleeping,
text: slouched on the seat next to him.
speaker_heading: BOGDAN
dialog: Shall I drive her home?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: EXT. - STREET BY FLAVIA’S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE - DAY
text: Toni gets out of the car. He hesitates for a moment, then approaches the apartment
text: block and looks for the correct buzzer. Suddenly, Ines appears next to him.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: What is this place?
text: Toni presses the buzzer. Bogdan joins them and gives Toni the bag of apples, which
text: he'd left behind. A voice emanates from the intercom.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (in Romanian)
dialog: Da, alo? (Yes, hello?)
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Toni... Ambassador Erdmann.
text: There’s a buzz, and Toni pushes the door open. Ines looks at him tiredly. Toni
text: disappears into a darkened hallway. Just before the door swings closed, Ines reaches
text: for it and follows Toni inside.
scene_heading: INT. - FLAVIA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Toni notices that Ines has followed him. She hesitates again by the elevator.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Let’s stop this now, Dad.
text: Nonetheless, she gets into the elevator. The doors close and Toni presses a button.
text: They travel upwards. Exhausted, Toni and Ines look at themselves in a small mirror.
scene_heading: INT. - FLAVIA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - LANDING - APARTMENT - DAY
text: The door to an apartment stands ajar. Noises drift out from within. A CHILD peers
text: around the door and shortly afterwards DORINA, a pretty, elderly woman with curly
text: red hair and a dramatic outfit, appears.
speaker_heading: DORINA
dialog: Buna... (Hello...)
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Hello... Erdmann... Ms. Schnuck, my secretary.
text: The woman beckons them inside. She gestures at a coat rack, but Toni and Ines have
text: nothing to hang up. Toni holds the bag of apples like a gift.
speaker_heading: DORINA
dialog: Flavia!
text: Dorina disappears along a long corridor. Toni and Ines stay behind. The sound of a
text: family gathering reaches them.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Please, let’s go...
text: Flavia, the woman whose plate Toni held at the party, appears at the end of the
text: corridor and walks towards them. Toni gives Ines the bag of apples to hold.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: Oh, hello. You really came...
text: She’s genuinely surprised by the visitors.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Spontaneous decision... Only if we don’t make
dialog: problems?
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: No... Sorry for my sister.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Ms. Schnuck... You already know her. Some
text: apples from the embassy’s garden.
text: Toni gestures at Ines, who has no choice but to offer the apples to Flavia.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: Thank you.
text: Flavia looks at Ines and Toni, trying to work out what’s going on with them.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Please come in...
speaker_heading: TONI

speaker_heading: INES
dialog: He had this vision of how he would paint an

speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: Oh, I see. Please come in.
dialog: Ines requires extra persuasion.
scene_heading: INT - FLAVIA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Flavia leads the strange guests into a packed living room. Numerous family
text: members are lounging with the children ona corner sofa, eating and watching TV.
text: It’s not clear whether it’s a family party or the preparations for such a party. Flavia
text: quickly beckons Ana over. She’s the young woman who was with her at the
text: headhunting company’s party.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: (to Ana)
dialog: You remember Mr. Erdmann from the party.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: Yes, hello...
text: Ana nods in surprise and looks at Tonia little warily. Suddenly, Winfried feels
text: uncomfortable. Ines smiles politely at Ana and again resists the urge to leave.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: Do you want a coffee or a tea?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Oh yes, that would be great.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Just a water.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: We didn’t paint Bukowina eggs. But we can show
dialog: you some...
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: OK.
text: Flavia beckons to her sister, Dorina, the woman who opened the apartment door for
dialog: Ines and Toni.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA

dialog: Dorina, dansul este un amic care lucreaz? la

dialog: Mr. Erdmann. We met at Ana’s company’s party.
dialog: He works in the German embassy and wants to
dialog: know a bit about the Bukowina technique.)
speaker_heading: DORINA
dialog: OK...
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: (to Toni)
dialog: My sister will explain to you.
text: Flavia guides them to a table. On it lie some eggs which have been painted by
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Wow, this is very beautiful.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: No, no, we just did it with the children.
text: Flavia quickly fetches a box from a shelf and takes out a couple of eggs. Ana switches
dialog: ona strange little oven.
speaker_heading: ANA (CONT'D)
dialog: The wax should be hot soon.
text: Flavia comes over with the box. Dorina helps her; They take out a couple of very
text: traditional-looking eggs. No-one really seems to know why the strange guests are
text: specifically interested in the eggs, but Dorina explains in Romanian anyway, before
dialog: Ana translates into English.
speaker_heading: ANA (CONT'D)
dialog: (in English)
dialog: In the first step, you paint a pattern with wax on
dialog: the egg. After that the egg will be put in the color
dialog: bath. So under the wax it stays white.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Translation please, Ms. Schnuck.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in German)
dialog: The first step is to paint the egg with a wax
text: pattern. Then it’s dipped into a dye bath and
text: colored. The bit under the wax remains white.
text: Flavia comes back carrying two aprons.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Shall I help in the kitchen?
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: No, because of the colors. I thought you want to
dialog: try...
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (mixing German and English)
dialog: Yes, gerne...
text: Toni lets them tie the apron around him. Ines politely declines.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: Please... sit down.
text: Flavia points to two chairs. Amongst the children’s eggs, Dorina and Ana find the
text: one remaining white egg.
speaker_heading: ANA
text: There is only one left.
text: Dorina checks the oven, which is now hot. Ines hides her impatience: There’s no way
text: she can escape from the situation without seeming impolite.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: I will bring the coffee.
text: Toni sits down. Dorina demonstrates painting something onto the egg using a
text: pointed tool. Dorina continues in Romanian, handing the tool to Toni while Ana
dialog: translates.
speaker_heading: ANA
dialog: With this tool you put the wax on the egg. It’s
dialog: complicated.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Ms. Schnuck...
text: Ines translates unwillingly.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Now you use it to paint something on the egg.
text: Toni paints a crooked, dripping line of wax onto the egg. Flavia arrives with two
text: cups of coffee and pieces of cake. Toni hands the egg to Ines along with the tool.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: It’s your turn now.
text: Ines reluctantly sits down.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (in German)
dialog: And take a few notes, please.
text: He takes the cake and follows Flavia into the living room.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: And Orthodox Easter is when?
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: On Friday... But we come together before. On
text: Easter everybody is at their own home.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Thank you that we can be here... The cake is
dialog: good.
text: Toni looks at Ines, who’s being shown how to dip the egg in the dye bath. She sits
text: between the two women, exhausted and deep in thought, and lets the Romanian
text: explanations wash over her.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Flavia)
dialog: We just came from the countryside. We visited
text: an oilfield.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: Oh, really?
text: Ines looks at her father and Flavia. The latter is now reprimanding a YOUNG BOY for
text: irksomely hitting the keys of a keyboard. All of a sudden, Ines stands up.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (to Ana)
dialog: Iam sorry. I really have to leave now. It was very
dialog: interesting.
text: She walks over to Toni and Flavia.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)

dialog: Ihave to go... 1 am so sorry.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Can we play a song for you, just to say thank
dialog: you? We always do that.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: OK, why not?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: (in German)
dialog: For once, let’s finish something politely.
text: He sits down at the keyboard and starts playing. He repeats an intro phrase...
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT’D)
dialog: Mes dames et messieurs, mon secretary and I
dialog: want to play a song for you. Over twenty years

text: He looks at Ines. She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: Please give an applause... to the fantastic
dialog: Whitney Schnuck.
text: A few people clap. Toni repeats the intro again and again, as if he’s waiting for her.
dialog: We recognize it as the start of Whitney Houston’s “The Greatest Love of All’. The
text: guests look expectantly at Ines. The pressure builds. Ines looks at Flavia, who gives
text: her a friendly smile. She finds the courage to take a few steps forward. Once again,
text: Toni starts playing “The Greatest Love of All.” She starts to sing.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I believe the children are our future
dialog: Teach them well and let them lead the way

text: Ines deliberately starts warbling in a slightly exaggerated way.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
dialog: Let the children’s laughter remind us how we used
dialog: to be
text: The guests, however, remain serious, and the song becomes too complicated for
text: Ines’ performance to stay ironic. She has to focus on staying in tune and
text: remembering the lyrics. She’s too ambitious to let herself sing badly. She’s seized by
text: her anger towards Toni, and she wants to show him she can do this.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Everybody’s searching for a hero
dialog: People need someone to look up to
dialog: I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs

scene_heading: INT. - FLAVIA’S APARTMENT BLOCK - STAIRWELL - LANDING - DAY
text: Ines has already descended the stairs. For a moment, Toni thinks about going after

speaker_heading: FLAVIA

speaker_heading: TONI (CONT'D)
dialog: You know I am not the German ambassador.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: Yes... | know the German ambassador.
text: Toni can’t help but laugh.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I’m so sorry. All this was fun. I am on holidays.
dialog: Visiting Ms. Schnuck... She is my daughter. I came
dialog: to see howit is here, how she lives, but it was
dialog: very complicated.
speaker_heading: FLAVIA
dialog: I know... family.
text: Flavia nods her head towards the apartment. They look at each other.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT BLOCK - STAIRWELL - APARTMENT - DAY
text: Ines arrives at her apartment door. Three PARTY SERVICE EMPLOYEES have carried
text: everything to the door. Ines lets them in and stands disorientated in her apartment.
text: She watches as two men and a young woman from the party service company put
text: together a round dinner table, hang up floral decorations and methodically load
text: things into her refrigerator. Ines makes an effort to decide where everything should
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: PARTY SERVICE WOMAN
dialog: Please be careful with the flammable liquid, and
dialog: we marked the wasabi sauce. It’s super spicy.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Thank you so much. It looks incredibly good.
speaker_heading: PARTY SERVICE WOMAN
dialog: We will bring the rest tomorrow. And if you have
dialog: any questions, this is our emergency hotline.
dialog: Thank you for choosing Dariu’s Catering.
text: The woman hands Ines a card.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Ines lies motionless in her bed. Her cellphone beeps: She seems to be receiving
text: birthday greetings. She listens to a voice message, and we hear faintly as her mother
text: and Gerhard sing “Happy Birthday” and send her their best wishes. She hangs up
text: before the message is finished.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Ines walks from her bedroom into the kitchen. She’s blow-dried her hair and pinned
text: it up, and she’s wearing a chic, tight-fitting dress. Its zipper isn’t quite closed. She
text: stands perplexed in front of the buffet, then adjusts a couple of items. She gropes for
text: the label that’s still hanging from her dress and rips it off. She takes out a fork,
text: threads its prongs into the zipper on the back of her dress, and pulls it up. She takes
text: a bowl of fruit from the refrigerator and walks into the living room. Everything’s in
text: place for a casual buffet party. The food looks very expensive. She adjusts a few
text: things and then walks back into the hallway. She glances into the mirror in the guest
text: bathroom. She fixes her hair. The overly-tight dress is irritating her.
scene_heading: INT. - APARTMENT - HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Ines takes a pair of shoes from the closet in the hall and puts them on. She has to
text: hitch up her tight dress before she can reach the shoes. Their straps are difficult to
text: fasten. She walks back into the bedroom and looks at some other clothes that are
text: laid out on the bed. She tries to take off the dress, but fails. She can no longer reach
text: the zipper. She pulls the dress upwards, but that only works incrementally. The
text: doorbell rings. Ines struggles to take off the dress. She pulls it aggressively upwards
text: and gradually fights her way out - it envelops her like a straitjacket. The doorbell
text: rings again. She walks into the hallway, hesitates briefly then goes ahead and opens
text: the door. She’s naked apart from a pair of flesh-colored underpants. Steph stands
text: outside and looks at her with bemusement. Ines straightens up, surprised at her
dialog: own courage.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Am I too early?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, no, come in.
text: Steph gives Ines a gift, which she distractedly takes.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Steph walks into the living room. She’s surprised by Ines’ nakedness, but decides to
text: ignore it. Instead, she comments on the buffet.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Wow, this is really nice.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes, I was very happy with Dariu’s. They were
dialog: really nice. I mean, it’s a super small event.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Yes, he is the best.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Do you want...
dialog: (switching to English)
dialog: Ah, do you want to drink? What do you want to
dialog: drink? Crémant or a Sancerre?
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Sancerre...
text: Ines walks tensely to the refrigerator, fetches the Sancerre wine and pours Steph a
dialog: glass.
speaker_heading: STEPH (CONT'D)
dialog: Who is coming?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Basically my team from the office.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Great. New people.
text: Steph is now slowly starting to feel uncomfortable about the nudity. Ines tries to
text: open the gift, but that doesn’t work. She puts it down again. Steph picks up the gift
text: and tries to open it herself. The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: STEPH (CONT'D)
dialog: Iam also a last minute girl. Shall I help you
dialog: choose something? I bet your closet is bursting.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, thank you...
text: She looks out of the window. She waits a little too long before she turns around. The
text: doorbell rings again.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: OK, I open the door, and you get dressed.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, it’s OK.
text: Ines takes off her underpants and walks to the door. Realizing that she’s really going
text: to open it, Steph quickly retreats into the living room. Gerald stands outside. It takes
text: amoment for him to realize, with shock, that Ines is naked. He shrinks back. He’s
text: holding a bottle of champagne.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: Nothing’s wrong, Gerald. I just have nothing on.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: It’s a...a naked party.
text: Ines stands up straight. She’s struggling to stick by her assertion. Gerald laughs
text: nervously and tries to catch a glimpse into the apartment.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Interesting, OK.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: It’s part of the team building. Stupid idea, but I
dialog: couldn’t think of anything better off the top of
dialog: my head.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: (uncertainly)
dialog: I know that kind of thing from college. Isn’t it a
dialog: bit childish?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: You don’t have to join in. Ring the bell if you
dialog: change your mind.
text: Ines reaches into the apartment and hands Gerald a paper bag for his clothes. Then
text: she closes the door and turns to Steph, who’s appeared behind her in the hallway.
text: Ines walks back into the living room and gives Steph a questioning look. She’s trying
text: to hide the fact that she’s not totally convinced, but instead she sticks with her
dialog: assertion.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: What are we going to do with you now?
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: I’m definitely not undressing here.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: lam sorry, but then you have to go.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: You are kidding?
text: Ines shakes her head. Steph pointedly puts down her glass and slowly walks to the
text: door. She appears to be re-considering. Ines follows her, still naked. It almost seems
text: like she’s throwing Steph out. Steph opens the door and, at that moment, Tim steps
text: out of the elevator. Steph takes the stairs and mutters:
speaker_heading: STEPH (CONT'D)
dialog: Have fun, you two.
text: Tim is surprised at first to see Ines naked. He glances bemusedly in Steph’s
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Hey, am I early?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, it’s a naked party.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Gerald had the idea. He knows this kind of thing
dialog: from college. To strengthen the team spirit...
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Haha.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I’m being serious.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: And who’s already here?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No-one.
speaker_heading: TIM
dialog: Yeah, I know for sure they’re all in there, and I'll
dialog: be the only one who walks in naked. Call me
text: when the joke’s over.
text: They look at each other a little too long, then Tim leaves and Ines closes the door.
text: She walks into the bedroom, glances at her clothes once more and flops onto the
text: bed. She lies there quietly for what seems like forever. After a while, the doorbell
text: rings. Ines can’t bring herself to open it. Her cellphone rings. She looks at the caller
text: ID and sees that it’s Anca, but she doesn’t answer. Someone knocks at the door, this
text: time with more urgency. Ines looks through the spyhole and then hurriedly opens
dialog: the door.
scene_heading: INT. - INES’ APARTMENT - DAY
text: Anca, Ines’ assistant, stands naked outside the door, clutching her clothes to her
text: body and smiling shyly.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Hello...
text: She quickly slips into the apartment.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: Happy birthday.
text: She shakes Ines’ hand.
speaker_heading: ANCA (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: But it’s not about sex?
text: Ines shakes her head and, for a moment, she’s truly overwhelmed by her naked
text: guest. Anca is skinny and has a girlish figure.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: No, no.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: OK. So it’s just as a challenge...
text: Ines nods quickly and it dawns on her that she’s still wearing a bathrobe. She takes
text: it off. She beckons Anca into the living room.
speaker_heading: ANCA (CONT'D)
dialog: Am I the first?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes.
text: Anca relaxes a little, but finds it strange that there’s no-one else there. She pulls Ines’
text: blouse and a gift from her bag.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Unfortunately, it didn’t completely wash out.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Oh, thanks. That’s no problem at all.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: Here’s your present.
text: Ines unwraps the present and pulls out a cute little pocket calculator.
speaker_heading: ANCA (CONT'D)
dialog: Because you always ask for mine.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Thank you.
text: For a moment, Ines is moved by the gift.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: (in English)
dialog: Is everything OK?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: At the office you are always so stiff, and now you
dialog: come up with this.
text: Even though Anca’s playing along, she clearly finds the whole thing strange. She
text: looks around the apartment.
speaker_heading: ANCA (CONT'D)
dialog: You like it here?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: That’s good.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: Because | searched so long...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Oh, I didn’t know.
text: The doorbell rings. Anca straightens up nervously. Ines looks at her. Now she really
text: has to hold a naked party. She walks to the door.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: Where is the bathroom?
text: Ines points to the guest bathroom in the hallway. Anca disappears. Ines hesitates for
text: amomentat the door. The bell rings again and she opens up. She gets the fright of
text: her life. A dark, animal-like figure, a KUKERI, stands outside. His whole body is
text: covered in long, dark fur, and his head is like a tall, shaggy tower. In one hand he
text: holds a flowering shrub that’s been ripped from the ground. It’s difficult to say
text: whether he looks creepy or friendly. Ines hides behind the door. The creature
text: hesitates for a moment, then shuffles cumbersomely into the apartment. It’s not
text: until he’s halfway inside that he realizes Ines is naked. He stops and hesitates. He
text: gives her the plant (a bouquet of artificial flowers) and doesn’t know whether to
text: continue into the apartment. Ines isn’t sure who’s inside the costume. Anca
text: cautiously exits the guest bathroom, expecting to see a colleague. She screams and
text: stares at the Kukeri. The Kukeri notices her with surprise. He’s now in the company
text: of two naked women. He makes as if to leave. He seems to find the situation
text: suspicious. He moves towards Anca, who quickly retreats to safety.
speaker_heading: ANCA (CONT'D)
dialog: What is this? Who is under it?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: (in German)
dialog: But not Gerald?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I don’t know. Honest.
text: Anca doesn’t really believe Ines, because it could be another part of the team-
dialog: building exercise.
speaker_heading: INES (CONT'D)
dialog: (in German)
dialog: Are you Gerald?
text: The Kukeri shakes his head uncertainly - as if he, too, is wondering who he is. Ines is
text: also uncertain. The Kukeri’s dark fur creates a sinister impression. The costume is
text: striking. Nothing about it suggests that there’s a person inside. Anca tries to use her
text: handbag to cover herself a little. The doorbell rings again. Anca hides behind a
text: column. Ines has no choice but to walk to the door again and open it. Gerald stands
text: outside wearing an earnest expression. He’s clutching his clothes to his crotch. He’s
text: still wearing his socks and shoes.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Had a beer first.
text: He looks questioningly at Ines.
speaker_heading: GERALD (CONT'D)
dialog: Come in?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Ah, yes.
text: Gerald takes baby steps into the living room. He greets Anca with a nod. For her,
text: Gerald’s nakedness is far more difficult to deal with than her own. Gerald is still
text: hiding his genitals with his clothes. The Kukeri has retreated into a corner right
text: behind Gerald and stands there, motionless. Gerald doesn’t notice him. He looks at
text: Ines, awaiting further instructions.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: (to Ines)
dialog: And now? Totally naked? Or what's this about?
text: Ines nods vaguely. As if carrying out a dare, Gerald puts his clothes to one side. For a
text: moment he just stands there, naked. He still doesn’t notice the Kukeri standing
text: behind him. Suddenly, the Kukeri puts its paw on Gerald’s shoulder from behind.
text: Gerald screams and fends it off. The Kukeri briefly throttles him, then lets him go.
speaker_heading: GERALD (CONT’D)
dialog: Hard-core! Hard-core!
text: He turns around and stares at the monster that attacked him. He gives the Kukeri a
text: friendly pat on the back, as if there’s some coach inside the costume. As far as he’s
text: concerned, the whole thing was clearly pre-planned. Anca laughs with her hand in
text: front of her mouth.
speaker_heading: GERALD (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s awesome... How did you come up with this
dialog: kind of nonsense?
text: He walks to the Kukeri and gropes at it. The Kukeri playfully grabs Gerald’s neck for
dialog: a moment.
speaker_heading: GERALD (CONT’D)
dialog: He can’t take a joke.
text: Gerald walks to Anca and holds up his open hand. She doesn’t understand at first,
text: but then gives him a high-five. He does the same thing with Ines.
speaker_heading: GERALD (CONT’D)
dialog: Where did you get it?
speaker_heading: ANCA
dialog: I think it’s Bulgarian. Something against the evil
dialog: spirits.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Good for the team.
dialog: (in German)
dialog: What a load of nonsense. Awesome.
text: Gerald reaches uncertainly for his underpants and hurriedly pulls them back on.
text: Anca also disappears with relief into the bathroom. Gerald looks at the buffet. The
text: Kukeri sits down weakly for a moment on the edge of the sofa. His head is crooked,
text: giving him a sad appearance. He straightens it with his paws.
speaker_heading: GERALD (CONT’D)
dialog: OK, now I've earned a bite to eat. Wow, you've
dialog: really gone to town.
text: The Kukeri cumbersomely stands up and staggers to the door.
speaker_heading: GERALD (CONT’D)
dialog: Now he’s leaving already...
text: Ines watches him. The door swings closed. Ines looks distractedly at the brunch.
text: Anca exits the bathroom, fully dressed.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yeah, and... this is salmon with lemon remoulade.
dialog: Just serve yourselves. Guys, I have to pay that
dialog: guy quickly.
text: Ines grabs a bathrobe, walks out of the apartment into the darkened hallway and
text: runs down the stairs. Her colleagues, CORNELIU and DARIU, are just arriving. Ines
text: excuses herself and points them towards her apartment.
scene_heading: EXT. - STREET BY INES’ APARTMENT - NEAR UNIRII SQUARE - DAY
text: Ines sees the Kukeri turn a corner and runs after him. She spots him again. Still
text: wearing the full costume, he simply walks on. A couple of PASSERS-BY turn around
text: to look at him. Others pay him no heed. The sun hangs low and bathes the street in
text: warm light. Ines follows the Kukeri in her bathrobe, expecting him to take off his
dialog: head.
scene_heading: EXT. - PARK - UNIRII SQUARE - EVENING
text: The Kukeri crosses a large town square. Huge, illuminated advertising hoardings
text: appear: We're in the middle of the city. The Kukeri stops and stands by a kiosk. He
text: makes as if to remove the head, but then doesn’t. Ines catches up with him. She
text: continues to follow him without him seeing her. Exhausted, the Kukeri briefly sits
text: down ona bench. Two TEENAGERS take a photo of him. A YOUNG GIRL approaches
text: him and strokes his fur. He briefly puts a paw on her head. Then he stands up. The
text: attention is too much for him. He walks away through a few bushes into the center
text: of the park. Ines watches as he moves further away. She can’t stand it anymore.
text: Suddenly, she starts running.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Dad!
text: The Kukeri turns around. Ines sinks into his wiry fur and appears to shrink. The
text: Kukeri returns the embrace and Ines holds onto him as if she never wants to let go
text: again. The Kukeri holds her just as tightly, his head resting heavily on her shoulder.
text: After a while, he lets go of her. They look at each other for a moment. Suddenly, he
text: holds out his arms. Ines screams in shock. The Kukeri chases her for a few steps
text: then doubles back on himself. For a moment, he appears wild and energetic; His fur
text: wafts in the breeze. Then he tiredly raises his hand. Ines turns and walks back
text: towards her apartment. The Kukeri watches her. Her bathrobe lifts in the wind and
text: briefly flashes her bare behind before she disappears. As soon as she’s gone, the
text: Kukeri staggers behind a bush. He grabs at his head, but can’t pull it off. He begins to
text: lurch and slowly falls to his knees. Again, he grabs at his head, but then he lies down
text: and breathes heavily. He really doesn’t seem able to remove the head. For a long
text: while, he stays lying there. Then, seemingly using up his last reserves of strength, he
text: sits up.
scene_heading: EXT. - STREETS AROUND UNIRII SQUARE - EVENING
text: The Kukeri crosses a large intersection. For the first time, we really see something of
text: the city. There are lots of people around, all going their own way. The Kukeri looks
text: like a lonely alien.
scene_heading: EXT. - STREET BY WINFRIED’S HOTEL - NIGHT
text: The Kukeri turns onto a side street and disappears between a currency exchange
text: and an open-fronted florist’s into a small, low-budget hotel called “Ambassador.”
scene_heading: INT. - WINFRIED’S HOTEL - RECEPTION - NIGHT
text: The Kukeri enters the hotel’s reception area. A young CONCIERGE is absent-
text: mindedly watching a soccer match. The Kukeri gestures at his head and mumbles
text: something incomprehensible. The concierge understands what he means, leans over
text: the reception desk and, with a great deal of strength, pulls off the Kukeri’s head.
text: Winfried is pale. His sweat-drenched hair sticks to his scalp. The man puts the head
text: down on the desk and puts Winfried’s room key next to it. Winfried breathes
dialog: heavily.
scene_heading: EXT. - FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY
text: Winfried stands in front of an old building. Through the entrance to a courtyard, a
text: nondescript German street is visible. It’s a clear, somewhat autumnal day in late
text: summer. Winfried is wearing a dark suit and his beard has grown longer. WALTER,
text: aman around the same age as Winfried, waits with his WIFE, who briefly
text: straightens his necktie. IRMA, a woman also around Winfried’s age, is talking in the
text: background to two FUNERAL PARLOR EMPLOYEES.
speaker_heading: UNDERTAKER
dialog: Just let us know when the private part of the
text: ceremony is over.
speaker_heading: IRMA
dialog: Could we use your parking lot afterwards to load
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: UNDERTAKER
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: IRMA
dialog: Thanks. Roberto, could you take my bag for a
dialog: minute?
text: She gives her handbag to ROBERTO, a man of Mediterranean appearance, and walks
text: towards a dolled-up WOMAN who’s approaching her.
speaker_heading: IRMA (CONT'D)
dialog: Winfried, this is the singer.
text: Winfried nods at the singer and takes a few steps in the other direction. At the
text: entrance, we see a taxi pull up. Winfried watches as Ines and Renate get out. They
text: open the trunk and take out a floral arrangement. Winfried walks towards them.
text: Ines approaches her father. They embrace as closely as the flowers allow.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: A serious occasion...
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I’m glad you're here.
text: Winfried takes the flowers from her.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: Okay.
text: Winfried and Ines look at each other for a moment. It’s clearly the first time they’ve
text: seen each other again. Renate joins them and briefly embraces Winfried.
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: My sincere condolences.
text: Renate briefly shakes hands with Walter and his wife. Ines does the same.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
text: The coffin is still open.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: RENATE
dialog: I'll stay here.
text: Ines follows her father, surprised.
scene_heading: INT. - FUNERAL PARLOR/CHAPEL - DAY
text: A chapel is laid out with chairs. It’s modern and quite small. Referring to a booklet,
text: Irma is explaining the order of service to the singer. Winfried puts Ines’ flowers
text: down. He shakes hands with the singer and gestures at her and Irma to leave them
text: alone for a moment. Ines walks to the coffin in which her grandmother lies. Irma is
text: now decorating something at the other end of the room - she’s trying not to bother
text: them, but she is. For a moment, Winfried stays in the background, then he sits down
text: next to Ines and looks at his mother. She looks much smaller and strangely wax-like.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: I’m sorry I didn’t see her again.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: I think she understood that, somehow.
text: They sit there in silence.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: You can touch her if you like.
text: Ines leans forward and touches Annegret’s wrinkled hand. Winfried looks back at
text: Irma, who’s giving them a nagging look.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: We have to go. The line is long - they all still want
dialog: money from her.
text: He stands up and briefly touches his mother’s cheek. Irma turns to the funeral
dialog: parlor employees.
speaker_heading: IRMA
dialog: You can close the coffin now.
text: The employees walk to the coffin lid to close it.
scene_heading: INT. - FUNERAL PARLOR / CHAPEL - DAY
text: Ines sits in the chapel in the front row, next to her mother. Next to them are
text: Winfried’s sister Irma and a man, Walter, who appears to be Winfried’s brother. A
text: young, enthusiastic PASTOR brings his speech to a close. Ines glances furtively at her
text: father. The SINGER and her ACCOMPANIST, step forward. They begin to perform an
text: adapted, highly theatrical version of “Time to Say Goodbye” by Sarah Brightman and
text: Andrea Bocelli. Next to Winfried, Irma starts to sob. Winfrieds listens motionless.
dialog: It's hard to say what he feels.
scene_heading: INT. - ANNEGRET’S HOUSE - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/TERRACE - DAY
text: Ines walks through her grandmother’s house. She peers into the kitchen in which
text: some of her relatives are washing up the cake plates.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Can I help you with anything?
speaker_heading: TABEA
dialog: It’s almost done, thanks.
text: Ines looks out through the terrace window. Outside, Winfried is talking with Walter
text: and BENJAMIN. The men are holding bottles of beer. A couple of GRANDCHILDREN
text: are doing gymnastics on a swing seat and being reprimanded by their MOTHER.
text: Irma stands in front of an open sideboard.
speaker_heading: IRMA
dialog: (to Ines)
dialog: If there’s anything you're attached to, let us
dialog: know. Benjamin’s making a list.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Yes, I’ll think about it.
text: Ines walks outside and joins Winfried and Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And where are you these days? Budapest.
text: She ignores his mistake.
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: Bucharest, but I just finished there. Now I’m
dialog: going to Singapore for two years.
text: She looks at Winfried. It’s news to him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: They have the biggest whiskey bar in the world
dialog: there. What are these companies called?
speaker_heading: INES
dialog: You've probably heard of the new one, McKinsey.
dialog: I used to be with Morrisons.
text: Irma appears at the terrace door.
speaker_heading: IRMA
dialog: Winfried, can you come here?
text: Winfried walks to the door and glances into the living room.
speaker_heading: WINERIED (0.S.)
dialog: Just leave that there for now.
text: Ines looks at him and their eyes meet. Winfried gestures with his head for her to
text: follow him, then disappears.
scene_heading: INT. - ANNEGRET’S HOUSE - CELLAR - GARDEN - DAY
text: Ines follows Winfried without understanding what he’s looking for here. He
text: switches on a light and we see a scene of chaos left undisturbed for several years - a
text: dust-covered workbench, a collection of antlers, old guns, furniture and carpets.
text: Winfried picks something up and puts it down again. He stands there, at a loss. He
text: sits down for a moment.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED
dialog: That song. Irma’s crazy... They were supposed to
dialog: play something by Harry Belafonte. She liked
dialog: him, even though it was negro music to her...
text: He stands up and starts to rummage through the chaos and open up cupboards. He
text: takes out old coats and puts them away again. From under the hood of a hair dryer,
text: he pulls out a steel helmet. Ines watches him. He opens a door that leads to the
dialog: garden.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT'D)
dialog: All the things she kept. No idea whose this is. All
dialog: this stuff is genuine.
text: He gestures at an open cupboard.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
text: Full of hats.
text: He takes out a suitcase which really is full of all kinds of hats. Ines looks at them.
text: Most are unused; Some even still have the price tag. Ines takes out a summer hat
text: with fruit ornaments. She looks at Winfried as if she’s waiting for something from
text: him. It’s the first time they've been alone together since Bucharest. Winfried
text: hesitates for a moment, then plucks up the courage to say something.
speaker_heading: WINFRIED (CONT’D)
dialog: About your question there, in Bucharest, about
dialog: life. The problem is, it’s so often about getting
dialog: things done. And then you still have to do this, or
text: that. And, in the meantime, life just passes by.
dialog: But how are we supposed to hang on to
dialog: moments? Now I sometimes sit there and
dialog: remember how you learned to ride your bike or
dialog: how I once found you at a bus stop. But you only
text: realize that afterwards. In the moment itself, it’s
dialog: not possible.
text: He looks at her, unsure what she thinks about what he’s said. They’re silent for a
text: moment, then Ines reaches out and checks the breast pocket of Winfried’s shirt. She
