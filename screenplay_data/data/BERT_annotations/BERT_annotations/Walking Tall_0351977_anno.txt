dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: So dangerous, so violent, so highly
dialog: trained that he despatched six of the

dialog: of choice a simple piece of cedar. Which
text: in his hand became a devastating force
dialog: with one aim, to hurt people, destroy

dialog:

speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Did he give you any kind of advanced

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CASINO GUARD 2
dialog: We tussled, but he's a big guy. He was
dialog: on a mission. Besides, he seemed to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: So from what you saw, it seemed like
