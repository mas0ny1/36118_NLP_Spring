dialog: Written by

speaker_heading: FADE IN
text: The screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, a stone,
text: emerald green moss. It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some
text: distant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of
text: sunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The
text: whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant
text: rustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous.
text: We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming.
scene_heading: SUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT
dialog: 
text: rockets through the frame scaring us and ...
scene_heading: EXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE
text: running hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He's
text: twenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We'll learn later
dialog: this man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans.
speaker_heading: PROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS
text: flash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the man's skin. A
text: calico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads
text: over a breechcloth. He wears leggings to protect his legs. A long-handled
text: tomahawk is stuffed in his belt.
dialog: CUT TO ...

text: in the hand of another running man. He's heavier, older ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHEST
text: A green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is tattooed over
text: his left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty to forty-five. His head is
dialog: shaved into a scalp-lock. It says: "Come and lift this from me. Take it, if you
dialog: can ..." That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK.
dialog: The French call him "Le Gros Serpent," the Great Snake, because
dialog: "he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly
dialog: blow."
scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK
text: runs, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's running parallel
text: to Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. It's heavily canopied. There's
text: very little brush. The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate
text: motes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes
text: there's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock.
text: These men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into
text: ravines as if they own them. They do.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LONG BLACK HAIR - DAY
text: rocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a
text: wampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A long rifle in which is
text: carved the name "Killdeer" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest.
text: His name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and 	the French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other
dialog: frontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes
text: know him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree
text: branches disturbing nothing. Making no sound.
scene_heading: HAWKEYE'S POV: A PIECE OF TAN
text: two hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in the foliage ...
scene_heading: SUDDENLY HE STOPS
text: Killdeer's at his shoulder ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE'S THUMB
text: cocks the lock holding the piece of flint: click.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: stops dead, holding out his hand ... no sound.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: slips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore musket. Is this
dialog: an ambush?
scene_heading: HAWKEYE'S POV: RACK FOCUS THROUGH THE GUN SIGHT
text: Five feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left,
text: off target. It's a precise, smooth movement. No human quiver.

speaker_heading: THE COCK

text: is a huge elk that leaps at the sound.
speaker_heading: KILLDEER'S MUZZLE
text: CRACKS like lightning.
speaker_heading: AN ELK
text: leaps where the .59 caliber round was programmed to intercept him. On the moment
dialog: of impact ...
speaker_heading: WIDE
text: three men approach the fallen elk and each other. We realize they're hunting
text: together. Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook. His massive war club is flat and
text: angles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother.
text: The two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection.
dialog: Hawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness he's
text: more the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views and candid manner
text: and in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican).
text: As Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk ...]
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: (low Mohican; sub-titled)
dialog: We're sorry to kill you, Brother.
dialog: Forgive us. I do honor to your courage and
dialog: speed, your strength ...

scene_heading: EXTERIOR - INTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - JOHN CAMERON - NIGHT
text: roasts potatoes on a stick in the stone fireplace next to CAPTAIN JACK WINTHROP,
text: an American in very worn quasi-military gear. On a rough table in the tiny cabin
text: ALEXANDRIA, his wife, is kneading bread. Three children climb on their father.
text: He grabs their wild seven year old son, JAMES, who shrieks laughter and dodges
text: away. The cabin has two primitive rooms, waxed paper windows, log walls. O.S. a
text: dog barks. Others pick it up. Cameron &amp; Jack are suddenly alert, reaching for

text: Doorway: Cameron towards the interior ...
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Alexandria! Set three more places.
dialog: (to the fence)
dialog: How is Chingachgook, then?
text: Behind him, emerging from the dark trees are Hawkeye, Uncas, cradling flint
text: locks, blankets and packs over their shoulders, leading a mule laden with skins
text: and the elk carcass. Crossing the splitrail fence ...
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: The Master of Life is good. Another year pass ...
dialog: How is it with you, John?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Gettin' along. Yes, it is.
dialog: (warm)
dialog: Nathaniel.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Hello John. Cleared another quarter, I see.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: (shakes hands with Uncas)
dialog: Yes, I did.
speaker_heading: JAMES CAMERON
text: tears past his father &amp; runs full bore. Just before he's going to collide into
text: Uncas, he leaps into the air and Uncas snatches him with one hand and swings him
text: up onto his shoulders. The kid screams with delight and rides back towards the
text: cabin that way. Alexandria comes to the door.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR CABIN - CHINGACHGOOK - EVENING (LATER)
text: lights &amp; smokes a clay pipe. The scene says: this is a rustic, frontier home and
dialog: these people have known each other &amp; live in dangerous circumstances.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDRIA
dialog: If Uncas is with you, that means he has not
dialog: found a woman and started a family yet.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: Your eyes are too sharp, Alexandria Cameron.
dialog: They see into my heart.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
dialog: Your farm good to you this year, John?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: It was a good year for corn.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
dialog: Mohawk field we saw was 5 mile long on
text: the river. Chief Joseph Brandt's field.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You take much fur?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: That we did. John. But the horicane
dialog: (sic)
text: is near trapped out.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
speaker_heading: UNCAS
dialog: No, Schylerville. With the Dutch for silver.
dialog: French &amp; English want to buy with wampum
dialog: &amp; brandy.
dialog: Pause, then ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: A French &amp; Indian army out of Fort Carillon's
dialog: heading south to war against the English. I'm
dialog: here to raise this county's militia to aid the
dialog: British defense.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We'll see in the morning ...
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: Fathers of England &amp; France, both, take more
dialog: land, furs, than they need. They're cold &amp; full
dialog: of greed ...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Few'd deny that? Where you headin'?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Trap over the fall and winter among the
dialog: Delawares in Can-tuck-ee.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
dialog: So I can find a woman and make Mohican
dialog: children so our father will leave my brother
dialog: &amp; me in peace.
text: Alexandria laughs. So do Hawkeye &amp; Chingachgook.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: A son like me?
text: Uncas grabs James &amp; suspends him upside down.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
dialog: No. You are too strong. Turn me old
dialog: too fast!
text: Hawkeye grabs the kid from Uncas. The kid's laughing &amp; can't stay still.
text: Chingachgook watches, content, smoking his clay pipe.
speaker_heading: ALEXANDRIA
dialog: That's what he's doin' to his mama ...
text: She ruffles his hair and lifts the heavy iron pot off the tibbet. Uncas goes to
text: help her, she shrugs his hand away and carries it to the table herself. The men
text: gather around. There's pan-baked bread, a dish of salt, and the pot has venison
text: and yellow cornmeal in a kind of stew. Everyone waits.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Dear Father, thank you for rewardin' the fruits
dialog: of our labor with plenty. Amen.

scene_heading: EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - MOHAWK BOY &amp; JAMES CAMERON - MORNING
text: slam into other kids as they battle through a Lacrosse game. In the background are
text: sixty men, women and children. It's a community gathering held out of doors.
text: We've entered mid-scene. Captain Jack is standing on a box. Some women and kids
text: mill around some tables and boards laid over barrels. Cooking fires. Smoke.
text: Most but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers,
text: eight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing. Off to the side are
text: an English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's in
text: Albany. A man named HENRI speaks in French. His son, MARTIN, translates.
speaker_heading: HENRI
dialog: (O.S. in French)
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (translates)
dialog: My father says he was driven out of France by
dialog: the black robe priests and he would fight them
dialog: now but he lost his arm and so I will go in his
dialog: place.
dialog: Meanwhile ...
speaker_heading: ONGEWASGONE
text: is an unusually large Mohawk in a blue match coat with a little girl holding his hand. He
text: says something to Chingachgook who nods. Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an
text: outer grouping of the men. Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is
text: tattooed. As Martin finishes, he steps forward.
speaker_heading: ONGEWASGONE
dialog: John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ...
dialog: Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les
dialog: Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les
dialog: Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ...
dialog: These people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot
text: "mechanics" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins &amp; leggings. The
dialog: Mohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been
text: acculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts.
text: Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and
dialog: commercially played France &amp; England against each other very adroitly for over a
dialog: hundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations
dialog: with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of
dialog: co-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA
dialog: mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former
dialog: indentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier
text: hunters and trappers ... working people.
speaker_heading: ONGEWASGONE
dialog: (continues)
dialog: Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais.
dialog: My brothers have asked me to lead them in this
dialog: war so I speak for the Twin River Council.
text: The importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: His Majesty King George II is very grateful for
dialog: your support.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: How far up the valley?
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: To Fort William Henry.
speaker_heading: COLONIAL #1
dialog: ... two days from here.
dialog: Some don't like this.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: It should be enough to remind you France is
dialog: the enemy.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Your enemy ...
text: Heads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (loud)
dialog: I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Really? Do you want them to overrun all
dialog: New York colony?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: First place, you started it with the French over
text: fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on
dialog: their hands ...
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: (ignoring Hawkeye)
dialog: Will you men help us stop the French?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: ... and while they are cooped up in your fort,
dialog: what if the French send war parties to raid
dialog: their homes?
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: What then, Lieutenant?
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: For your own homes, for king, for country, that's
dialog: why you men ought to join this fight!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You do what you want with your own scalp.
dialog: Do not be tellin' us what to do
dialog: with ours.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: (furious; to Hawkeye)
dialog: You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: ... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject
dialog: at all.
text: Light laughter.
speaker_heading: COLONIAL #2
dialog: Nathaniel's right. But if I got to fight, figure I'll
dialog: try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of
dialog: my bean field.
speaker_heading: AD LIBS
dialog: Yes. Yeah. No ...
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I am stayin' on my farm. And any man who goes,
dialog: his family is welcome to fort-up with us 'til he
text: comes back.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to
dialog: fill the county's levy. But only if General Webb
dialog: accepts a few terms I got in mind ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE &amp; UNCAS
text: cross through the people. A few men drift off to their women at the tables.
text: It is apparent two-thirds of the men will join. A couple of jokes, light banter,
dialog: no hostility.
speaker_heading: AD LIBS
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: Webb? what's that, Jack ...?
text: As they cross through they start removing their shirts and weapons.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: You boys marchin' with us? What do you say?
speaker_heading: UNCAS
dialog: We had our say, Ian.
text: They approach the Lacrosse field. Chingachgook stands with Cameron in the
text: background, watching.
speaker_heading: LACROSSE FIELD
text: Uncas joins James. Hawkeye goes on the other side. A couple of young Mohawks and
text: a young blonde farmer shout hallo's and as the bodies crash into each other ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR BRITISH ENCAMPMENT, PARADE GROUND - SIX HUNDRED
scene_heading: 62nd REGIMENT OF FOOT - DAY
text: in two rows. At each command the crack troops respond en masse. Their hands slap
text: the stocks of their brown bess muskets in unison. These men are drilling in preparation
dialog: for war.
text: We witness a state-of-the-art, 18th century, precision killing machine.
scene_heading: REGIMENTAL SGT. MAJOR
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Shoulder arms!
dialog: (slam)
dialog: Order arms! Handle cartridge!
dialog: (men bite the paper)
dialog: Prime!
dialog: (powder dropped in pan)
dialog: Load! Draw ramrods! Ram cartridge! Return ramrod!
dialog: Make ready!
dialog: (muskets at chest height)
dialog: Pre-sent!
dialog: (muskets shouldered)
dialog: Make ready!
dialog: (muskets returned to chests)
dialog: Pre-sent!
dialog: (muskets returned to shoulder)
dialog: Fire!
text: Like a single shot, two hundred fifty black powder muskets fire .65 caliber lead shot at
text: chest height in a scythe of death.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT MAJOR
dialog: Prime! Load!
text: The Dutch roof lines of Albany are in the distance. Nearer, a coach races past.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR ROAD - HORSES GALLOP - DAY
text: Six horses, wide with dumb, mute strain. Foam, manes fly, their hooves pound the
text: yellow road into dust. Military outriders are on the three left side horses.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR COACH - MAJOR DUNCAN HEYWARD - DAY
text: sits erectly in the brilliant scarlet coat of the First Royal Regiment of Foot with gold
text: braid, blue-black facing and blue-black breeches, cavalry boots, spurs, a tricorn, white
text: wig (?) and a gorget (large medallion) around his neck. He's 28-30 and tough. He is
dialog: self-sure, principled reactionary. He believes human society is static &amp; layered into
text: hierarchies of class and they are absolutely impermeable. He opens a simple gold-
text: clasped case &amp; contemplates its contents ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD'S POV: CASE
text: an enameled portrait of a dark-haired young woman.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: as a soldier is militarily first-rate in his milieu: the open battlefields of Europe.
text: Right now, however, he is about to enter the forests of North America. He closes
text: his clasp and glances out the window as we enter Albany and as a facade of
text: buildings &amp; people pass.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR BRITISH HQ, ASSEMBLY ROOM - DOOR - DAY
text: Four Grenadiers come to attention as Heyward enters mid-scene.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: ... if they are not allowed leave to defend their
dialog: families if the French or Hurons attack the
dialog: settlements, no colonial militia is goin' to Fort
dialog: William Henry.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (low)
dialog: You, there. Help my man outside with the baggage.
text: GENERAL JEROME WEBB sees Heyward and nods. Three of Webb's Adjutants are
text: on either side. Three remaining Grenadiers in bearskin-covered mitred caps are at the
text: door. Facing Webb are a half dozen colonial representatives, including Captain Jack
text: Winthrop. Heyward watches Jack ...
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: They will report or be pressed into service!
speaker_heading: LARGE COLONIAL REP
dialog: Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear into
dialog: forest ... time it takes you to blink. Where's that
dialog: leave ya, then?
text: Heyward, preparing to hand over dispatches, is interrupted by the insubordinate tone.
text: Equally wound tightly is the Lieutenant.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: They will be found! Arrested ...
speaker_heading: WEBB
dialog: (cuts in)
dialog: I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence,
dialog: would ever object to his American subjects
dialog: defending their hearth &amp; home, their women &amp; children,
text: if threatened by the "scourge" of attack from savages,
dialog: aroused to such excess by our enemy, the
dialog: ever-perfidious French.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Does that mean they will be granted leave to
dialog: defend their homes if the settlements are
dialog: attacked?
speaker_heading: WEBB
dialog: Of course.
dialog: Heyward's more amazed by what he's just heard from Webb. These Americans,
text: including Jack, are streaming past him on their way out.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You got yourself a colonial militia, General.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir!
text: Webb's pouring gin.
speaker_heading: WEBB
dialog: Duncan. How was your journey?
text: The door closes. Dispatches are passed. They are now alone except for the General's
text: two Adjutants and a shadowy form waiting patiently in a corner. He's MAGUA. In the
text: dim light, he's motionless. Webb slides a glass across to Heyward.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: I didn't experience anything so surprising from
dialog: Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
speaker_heading: WEBB
dialog: And what is that?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
speaker_heading: WEBB
dialog: I know.
dialog: (assuming a co-commiserator)
dialog: One has to give Americans "reasons" and make
dialog: agreements to get them to do anything at all.
dialog: Tiring, isn't it?
dialog: (throws up his hands)
dialog: But that's the way of it here.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (tight)
dialog: I thought British policy is 'Make the
dialog: World ... England', sir.
text: A chill. Majors don't upbraid Generals.
speaker_heading: WEBB
dialog: You will take command of the 62nd Regiment
dialog: of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel
dialog: Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard
dialog: from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to
text: rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them
dialog: to the fort.
speaker_heading: WEBB
dialog: Yes. You may.
dialog: (to Magua, after a glance at Heyward)
dialog: You there. What does Munro call you?
dialog: (to Heyward)
dialog: The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies
dialog: to guide you.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: rises and slowly walks into the light. He is reserved and over six feet tall. His head is
text: shaved into a mohawk. Rings, beads &amp; feathers pierce his ears. A blanket is worn as a
text: shawl over his left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing. A long
text: tomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth.
speaker_heading: WEBB
text: The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's
text: house. A company of the 33rd will accompany
dialog: you and Magua will show you the way.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: By your leave, sir.
dialog: Webb holds Heyward a moment
speaker_heading: WEBB
dialog: (to Adjutants)
dialog: Explain to the Major we care little about toying
dialog: with colonial militia because we have little to
dialog: fear from the French. They have not the nature
text: for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with
dialog: their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would
text: rather make love with their faces than fight.
text: Webb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit. Heyward's stiff, perfunctory smile. He's
text: been made the butt of the joke. He does not share Webb's derisive view of the French.
dialog: Webb doesn't like Heyward's manner. We don't like Webb. Then:
speaker_heading: WEBB
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Dismissed.
text: Heyward stiffly salutes. Webb casually, perfunctorily salutes the younger man in
dialog: return.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (to Magua)
text: Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See
dialog: to it you're there.
text: Beneath Magua's barely deferential manner we sense intelligence &amp; menace. None of 	these Brits see it. We do.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE - DUNCAN HEYWARD - DAY
text: brushed clean, his wig freshly powdered, his tricorn in his hand with a crimson sash and
text: sword and his cavalry boots, walks through the gate after knocking. He enters a small
text: courtyard. Suddenly he hears ...
speaker_heading: CORA
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: Heyward! Duncan Heyward.
text: Heyward looks to the side. An inner light turns on. In this mode, this is a man we could
dialog: like.
speaker_heading: REVERSE: CORA MUNRO
text: enters from the garden. She's vivacious, dark-haired, unconventional in that she's
text: educated, but with conventional values and attitudes. She hugs Duncan to her and
text: then pushes him away to look at him.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: My God it's good to see you.
text: He takes her hand in both of his and kisses it. He is open and lit up.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE, BACK YARD - CORA &amp; HEYWARD - DAY
text: A vegetable plot behind the Poltroon's house is a provincial substitute for a formal
text: garden setting. Heyward and Cora sit on rough wooden chairs. Wind blows. In the
text: background a servant hangs laundry. The white sheets billow. A table holds a tea
text: setting. They're sitting close to each other, talking seriously and quietly. Duncan's
text: jacket is removed. Time's passed. Long pause. Then:
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so
dialog: long apart and after you've traveled so far ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: And by sea!
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: You still have an aversion to the water?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Aversion? No. ... "Hatred" ... "Loathing" ...
text: Cora laughs.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: But it was worth it all to end in a garden by
dialog: your side.
text: She looks askance at him. Then the banter drops.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (difficult)
dialog: Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest
dialog: friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect
dialog: you immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings
dialog: don't go beyond that. Do you see?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis
dialog: for a man and woman to be joined? And all
dialog: else may grow in time ...?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Some say that's the way of it.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: "Some"?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (interrupts)
dialog: Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined,
dialog: we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let
dialog: those whom you trust, your father, help
dialog: settle what's best for you. In view of your
dialog: indecision, why not rely on their advice and
dialog: judgment as well as mine?
text: Cora stares directly at Heyward. Then she looks away. She has no answer. Something
text: subterranean disturbs her about delegating judgment over the fate of her life.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Will you consider that?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (pause; smiles)
dialog: Yes. Yes, I will.
text: She's still unsettled.
speaker_heading: ALICE
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: Duncan!
scene_heading: REVERSE: ALICE MUNRO
text: eighteen years old, white-blonde hair, wide blue eyes. She's effervescent and runs
text: to hug him. Heyward is taken aback by her enthusiasm and laughs.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: My God, you've grown up.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: We leave in the morning?!
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (rises)
dialog: Yes, miss.
speaker_heading: ALICE

speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: climbs onto his white military charger. It's spirited. Cora &amp; Alice are in riding dresses
text: and veils. The veil doesn't completely cover Alice's golden hair and blue eyes and the
text: flush of her complexion. They're riding two sidesaddled Narragansetts. The tight
text: traveling dress reveals that Cora, two or three years older than Alice, is fuller and more

speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Can we rest soon?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Heyward rides to the front of the column to Magua, who's twenty to thirty yards ahead

speaker_heading: HEYWARD

speaker_heading: HEYWARD

speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: (perfect English)
dialog: I understand. This is not good place to stop.

scene_heading: EXTERIOR MOUNTAINS &amp; FOREST - WIDE - DAY
text: Silently entering on either side of us come Chingachgook, followed by Hawkeye and
text: Uncas. Even relaxed, they carry themselves with a degree of alertness. They're
text: eighteenth century Viet Cong moving through the rain forest. The Maxfield
text: Parrish/Hudson Valley of tall trees, ravines and streams is idyllic in front of them. All
text: three cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet.
scene_heading: FRONTAL: CHINGACHGOOK
text: - in a stream - relaxed but attentive, abruptly stops. The others freeze in their tracks.
text: Chingachgook sees and then stoops to examine ...
speaker_heading: ROCK
text: under the water in the stream. It's been turned from its bed. Chingachgook finds
text: another. Uncas, moving up on his flank, climbs the bank and moves off into the trees,
text: searches and then he gestures ... he's found another sign of something.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: has headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing. Rapidly he rejoins Uncas
text: and Hawkeye who've become extremely alert. They move up the bank into the forest
dialog: ninety degrees from their previous path.
scene_heading: TRACKING: HAWKEYE, UNCAS &amp; CHINGACHGOOK

dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: CLOSER - MAGUA'S
text: slid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist. He lets the shaft

text: we didn't see before. Magua turns about face and advances on the column.
text: TRACK WITH Magua.
text: Heyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt. Major Ambrose, marching
text: in advance of the men. Magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row.
text: We see Magua has caught the Redcoat's eye.
speaker_heading: REDCOAT
text: is curious, starts to smile. What does the Huron want to say to him? When Magua is
text: two steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's head at the temple with the

speaker_heading: HEYWARD

speaker_heading: BRITISH
dialog: dead and dying.
speaker_heading: AMBROSE
text: blood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping a Huron; slashes a

scene_heading: HEYWARD &amp; CORA &amp; ALICE
text: ready to die. Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon. He readies ...
speaker_heading: THREE LOUD SHOTS
text: BLOW three of the Hurons sideways, head over heels down the rise.
speaker_heading: REVERSE: THREE MEN
text: barely seen, running diagonally across the fall line of the ravine. In parts, we recognize
text: Nathaniel, recharging Killdeer on full run, and Uncas.
speaker_heading: HURON'S
text: not sure where the shots came from. Suddenly Chingachgook slams him, head first into
text: the ravine with the war club. He didn't even slow down.
speaker_heading: HURON

dialog: Redcoats who fight on ...
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: calmly sees the odds have changed. His attention becomes focused. He commits a very
text: revealing act seen through the blurred foreground action of struggling bodies. We will
text: remember it. He raises his musket and aims at ...
speaker_heading: CORA MUNRO
text: who's unaware she's a target. Why is he singling out a Munro girl to kill?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: sees. Killdeer's at his shoulder ...
scene_heading: TIME SLOWS: MAGUA
text: senses Hawkeye. Moving through liquid, his eyes drift left. The moment is frozen.
text: Their eyes lock, each to the other's. Then ...
speaker_heading: TIME UNFREEZES
text: Magua swings at Hawkeye and FIRES ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: shifts. The .65 caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and he's already squeezing
dialog: Killdeer's trigger as ...
scene_heading: HAWKEYE'S POV OVER BARREL: SMOKE
text: from Magua's musket blast clears. Magua's gone. He almost shape-shifted, it happened

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: lowers Killdeer, impressed.
speaker_heading: CORA
text: glances back at Hawkeye. She doesn't know why he's looking at her.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: pursues two fleeing Hurons up the incline. Two strides gain him the first man, who he
text: hamstrings and runs over to pursue the second up the hill ... as ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: in the confused melee, grabs a found musket and aims it at an Indian. We recognize that
text: he's aiming at Chingachgook pursuing the second Huron up the hill ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: No, Duncan!
text: Duncan ignores her.
scene_heading: HEYWARD'S MUSKET
text: is jerked from his hands.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: ... case your aim is any better'n your judgment.
text: He's drawn his sword, reflexively. Hawkeye flips the musket around one-handed. It's
text: pointed at Heyward's chest. And Hawkeye FIRES, killing an attacking Huron behind
text: Heyward. As Heyward spins ...
scene_heading: CHINGACHGOOK'S WAR CLUB
text: flashes up the hill. It cleaves the second man's back and bowls him over. Chingachgook
text: retrieves his club as his scalping knife slashes down ...
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: scalps the man he killed. Chingachgook dispatches the Huron he hamstrung.
speaker_heading: WIDE
text: Sudden silence. Heyward's motionless. The women are frozen, as terrified of the
text: savages and apparent half-breed rescuers as they were of those who attacked them.
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: Cora, holding her, is stunned but functioning. Moments ago both women were clean
text: and demure. Now their riding dresses are torn, mud-stained, blood-spattered and their
text: baggage is gone.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD'S
text: crossed to his slaughtered soldiers. Moments ago they were a testament to British
text: military power. Now they're dead meat. Ambrose's body is against a tree. In the B.G. 	two of the wounded start to rise ...
speaker_heading: ALICE
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: Stop it!
text: Heyward spins.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: just cut the throat of the second Narraganset. It drops into the brush. Alice attacks
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: We need them to get out of here!
text: Uncas gently restrains her. Cora reaches Alice and grabs her away from the "savage".
dialog: Heyward runs in to protect the women ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (to Nathaniel)
dialog: ... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?!
text: Uncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, scanning the trees.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: ... too easy to track ... they can be heard for
dialog: miles ... find yourself a musket ...
text: Cora's surprised by Uncas' easy English. Hawkeye's scanning the forest.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Heyward)
dialog: Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.
dialog: They'll never make a passage north.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: We were headed ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (appropriating a knife)
dialog: ... Fort William Henry.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: to Hawkeye: let's go ... Then a fast exchange of Delaware. Cora's surprised to see it's
text: Chingachgook's decision. Chingachgook looks at the survivors, gives his assent, starts
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: ... take you as far as the fort.
text: Hawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora &amp; Alice look towards Heyward. He looks at
text: them: the women are totally terrified and do not move.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: If we are goin' to take you, we need to move.
dialog: Fast ... And the fort is well off our course.
dialog: So if you all rather wait for the next Huron
dialog: war party to come by, we'll be on our way.
text: Heyward quickly decides to go. The women follow. Hawkeye starts off after Uncas and
dialog: Chingachgook.
dialog: CUT TO ...

text: Duncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's and Chingachgook's steps ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE'S FEET
text: walking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones. The others
text: follow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: conforms. He's ill at ease not being in command, following the lead of some half-Indian
dialog: frontiersman through a foreign wilderness.]
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: How far is it, scout?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Day and a half
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Where did you get ... the guide?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our
dialog: Mohawk allies.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: He is Huron and nothing else.
dialog: (checking the Munro girls are
dialog: not too close)
dialog: Why would he want to murder the girl?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Dark haired ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on
dialog: her before today.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Of course not!
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And how is it you were nearby?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Fort Edward, then?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: I thought all our colonial scouts were in
dialog: the militia?
text: Off to the side, Uncas smiles at the idea.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn
dialog: militia.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (stops)
dialog: Then you are one of those who would allow
dialog: England to fight alone while she protects
dialog: you from France?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: England does not protect me and does not
dialog: war against France on our account. She uses
dialog: us to war against France on her own account ...
dialog: of greed for land and furs.
speaker_heading: CORA'S
text: appalled.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (turns)
dialog: Clear it up any?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (loud)
dialog: I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (low)
dialog: Do not let gratitude get in the way ...
text: Cora's hand holds back Heyward's sword arm because suddenly Chingachgook looms
text: over him.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: (to Hawkeye)
dialog: Yengeese no good in woods. Make more
dialog: noise, I kill him.
text: Heyward spins. Hawkeye coolly watches Cora. Her attitude is hostile; aligned with
text: Heyward. He turns away. Meanwhile ...
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: stops, alarmed. Something in the air bothers him. Hawkeye smells it, too.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: is already moving out front, low and fast ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - GREEN BRANCHES - DAY
text: After we HOLD, we realize Chingachgook's been there all along. Hawkeye and Uncas
text: join him where the branches meet the ground. Smoke drifts through the trees.
text: Hawkeye sees and dips his head, then looks again ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - WIDE - DAY
text: Burned, smoldering, having fallen in on itself. TRACK LEFT past what was the
text: doorway. A dead child's hand protruding from the ruin. A fragment of a dress. Charred
text: and smoldering wood. John Cameron's body in the wreckage. And then, through the
text: collapsed posts and timbers, Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas have advanced and
dialog: are seeing what we've just seen; and then Cora and Alice.
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: approaches and is frozen in horror. Cora shields her from the sight. Cora is affected but
text: confronts it directly.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
speaker_heading: (O.S.)
dialog: Anything to be done?
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: returns from under one part of the wreckage, ashen, stoic, as they all are. We know the
dialog: degree of their inner pain.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
dialog: All dead ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: bends over a moccasin print that Chingachgook's examining. They look at each other
text: grimly. Heyward joins them.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Who were these people?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (re: print)
dialog: Ottawa!
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Excuse me ...
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: (to Hawkeye)
dialog: Ottawa.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: enters, very careful where he places his feet ... Hawkeye gestures to Heyward to stay
text: where he is: on the periphery with the women.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: Mirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Chingachgook)
dialog: Movin' fast, not able to carry much ...
dialog: this was a war party?
text: Chingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in Mohican. The significance
text: is very ominous to them. We don't know why yet. Chingachgook starts away ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Let us look after them ...
text: He starts approaching the bodies.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: Leave them.
text: Heyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (hasn't moved)
text: Though they are strangers, they are at
dialog: least entitled to a Christian burial!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Let us go, miss.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I will not. I have seen the face of war
dialog: before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on
dialog: women and children. And almost as
dialog: cruel is your indifference.
text: Hawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step back, fearful.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (contained)
dialog: Miss Munro.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: They are not strangers ....
dialog: And they stay as they lay ...!
speaker_heading: CORA
text: realizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She also realizes for the
dialog: first time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and
text: rhythms she doesn't understand. He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a
dialog: moment.
text: WIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE
text: as Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks,
text: walk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward
text: helping Alice and Uncas as rearguard.
text: The ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT
text: moves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and
text: some thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. Chingachgook and the others
text: avoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: mutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the white birch,
text: soundlessly.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: throws Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound
text: and - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora &amp; Alice to rest there.
speaker_heading: ALICE'S HEAD
text: hits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. Heyward is nearby on
dialog: watch.
text: Hawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped
dialog: mound.
dialog: Cora has sought him out.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: doesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking at her.
dialog: They whisper ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Why didn't you bury those people?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would
dialog: see it as a sign of our passing ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: You knew them.
text: Hawkeye looks at her and nods.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (stiffly)
dialog: You were acting for our benefit. And I
dialog: apologize. I misunderstood you.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Well that is to be expected. My father ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Your "father"?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Chingachgook. He warned me about
dialog: people like you.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: He did?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Yes. He said ... "do not try to make them
dialog: understand you."
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Yes. And "do not try to understand them.
dialog: That is because they are a breed apart and
dialog: they make no sense ..."
text: Cora's indignation is cut off because ...
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: moving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy. Uncas
text: disappears around the mound.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT
text: Nothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the
text: white birch.
scene_heading: RED-PAINTED FACE
text: white eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head.
text: Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by
text: others. Wary, silently, they hunt.
scene_heading: DEEPER: MORE OTTAWA
text: Towards the rear are two French Rangers ("Coureurs des Bois") from Le Regiment de
text: la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and
text: breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're
dialog: the 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the
dialog: Ottawa find our people, it's all over.
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: seeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and
text: involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and
text: silences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her,
text: looking towards the advancing Ottawa.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: on his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground.
speaker_heading: OTTAWA &amp; FRENCH
text: are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people. Mist
text: envelops them ...
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: His massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: waiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there. Nathaniel's
text: impressed with her cool. He hands her a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop
text: of moccasined feet ...
speaker_heading: OTTAWA
text: through the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. Then their leader
text: gestures and they start backing out. The French Rangers continue towards the crescent.
text: The Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers
text: something inaudible. The Ottawa chief shakes his head, "Non. Pas possible ..."
dialog: And means it. They retreat.
scene_heading: SEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA
text: tensely monitor the Ottawa retreat.
speaker_heading: UNCAS &amp; ALICE
text: He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, then she looks up,
text: catches his eyes. Then she averts her face.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: sees all of it; doesn't like it.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: The Ottawa are gone.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Why did they turn back?
text: In answer Hawkeye looks behind &amp; above her head.
speaker_heading: CORA
text: turns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted
text: against the night sky in the distance. They have camped on sanctified ground, a burial
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: CORA &amp; HAWKEYE
dialog: She thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the
text: danger &amp; complexity of this place. She hands the pistol back to him. Their hands almost
dialog: touch.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (still pissed off)
dialog: "We're a breed apart and we make no
dialog: sense" ...?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

dialog: In your particular case, miss, I would
dialog: make some allowance ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Thank you so much.
text: Cora is angry. Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her. She settles, looking at him.
text: Her mood changes. Then ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: You called Chingachgook your "father"?
dialog: Where is your real family?
text: Hawkeye's surprised by her question.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: They buried my ma &amp; pa and my sisters.
dialog: And Chingachgook - who found me with
dialog: two French trappers - raised me up as his
dialog: own.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I do not remember them. I was one or two.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: How did you learn English?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: My father sent Uncas &amp; I to Reverend
dialog: Wheelock's school when I was ten. So
dialog: we would know both worlds ... though
dialog: we were told only bother learning readin' &amp;
dialog: arithmetic from yous.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: And what were the consequentialities of
dialog: European culture you didn't bother with?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas
dialog: about the government of men. My father's
dialog: people already know each man is his own
dialog: nation. And only he can have dominion
dialog: over himself. Not kings. No man is better
dialog: than any other man.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: In London those radical ideas could land
dialog: you in Newgate prison.
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: Why were those people living in this
dialog: defenseless place ...?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: 'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable
dialog: to poor people. So after seven years
dialog: indentured service in Virginia, they headed
dialog: out here where they are beholden to none
dialog: and not livin' by another's leave ...
dialog: Their name was Cameron. John &amp; Alexandria.
text: Cora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of stars. She looks at 	Hawkeye; then again up at the night sky.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (continuing; looking up)
dialog: My father's people say ... at the birth of the
dialog: sun and of his brother, the moon, their
dialog: mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth
dialog: her body, from which was to spring all life.
text: And he drew forth from her breast the stars.
text: The stars he threw into the night sky to
text: remind him of her soul.
dialog: (the sky)
dialog: So there is the Camerons' monument ...
dialog: my folks', too, I guess.
speaker_heading: CORA'S
text: pensive. Hawkeye's watching her. Her reaction is enigmatic. After a pause ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (low)
dialog: You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not
dialog: understand what is happening here.
dialog: And it is not as I imagined it would be,
dialog: thinking of it in Boston and London ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Sorry to disappoint you ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (eyes downcast)
dialog: On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ...
dialog: to my blood ...
dialog: (then up into his eyes)
dialog: ... than any imagining could possibly have
dialog: been ...
text: She closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep. Hawkeye is the one left staring
text: into the birch forest, a little surprised. Some of his assumptions about her were
dialog: wrong ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FOREST - WIDE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Deep fog has set in. A hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us. It moves a

text: Hawkeye. They hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the Adirondacks.

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Will we be able to bathe?

speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Thunder ... Papa will arrange something.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: looks over his shoulder, sees something in the far distance, gestures to Hawkeye and
dialog: Chingachgook.
scene_heading: HAWKEYE'S POV: DISTANT HILLS

speaker_heading: HEYWARD

dialog: you desire, Alice ...
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora
dialog: doesn't marry you, I shall.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Alice!
dialog: Heyward laughs. Hawkeye sees them. It bothers us: will these Europeans, including
dialog: Cora, shed their frontier experience?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I can't wait to see Papa ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: And you, Duncan? What are you looking
dialog: forward to?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: Posting to a different continent.
text: He and Alice laugh. Cora does not.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I think it's very important and exciting.
text: Heyward looks at her. She's not kidding.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD
text: helps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to
text: Hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like. His dark
text: thoughts are distracted by a FLASH of light and more ROLLING THUNDER.
scene_heading: WIDE FROM THE FRONT - HAWKEYE
text: drops and pulls Cora to the ground.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Lightning?
text: Hawkeye doesn't answer as he, Chingachgook, Uncas and Heyward make their way to

scene_heading: THEIR POV: FORT WILLIAM HENRY
text: is none of those things. The thunder is the roar of French siege cannon clouded in dense
text: smoke. The flashes of light are mortar bombs exploding and illumination rockets' red
text: glare. Fort William Henry is under a massive siege by a French and Huron army.

scene_heading: WIDE ANGLE FROM THE WATER
text: A new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of the fort. On the north, the
text: fire fight is reflected on the black water of Lake George in our foreground. Then a dark
text: shape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections. We see in silhouette the outline of a
text: birch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE BANK - DEBRIS
text: Behind it, two Canadiens and a Huron alternately snipe at the ramparts.
scene_heading: LOW &amp; WIDE: SNIPERS
text: Behind them is black water. Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook,
text: followed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and
text: the forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron
text: senses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife
text: flashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto
text: the debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side. Uncas jerks
text: him forward by the musket, folds him over and tomahawks him.

speaker_heading: CORA

speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: There was no letter.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: I sent three men to Webb!
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: One called Magua arrived.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: He delivered no such message.
text: Munro's stunned.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does
dialog: not know to send reinforcements!
text: Munro has nowhere for his rage to go. Meanwhile, Alice clings to her father. At 45-55,
text: the British Army has been his life. He blindly believes in its institutions, though officers
dialog: like Webb would disdain his Scots origins.
dialog: From under his fury:
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (flat)
dialog: What happened to you?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (suddenly tired)
dialog: Ambush ... on the George Road. This
dialog: Magua led us into it.

speaker_heading: UNCAS

dialog: Fine, Mr. Phelps. Have you cat gut and a

dialog: (for Uncas)
dialog: And we could use some rum, clothes, and

text: Cora tries to remove Alice from her father, but she clings to him. Munro holds her
text: tighter. Then he whispers something to her. She nods her head. And Cora takes her.
text: They exit.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
text: is moved beyond words by his daughters' presence. There's a break, a pause ...
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (to Heyward over table map)
dialog: What a place for them ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given
dialog: that I've seen of the French engineering from
dialog: the ridge above?
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (perfunctory)
dialog: Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine
dialog: and he has more of them. They keep our heads
text: down while his sappers make thirty yards of
text: trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a
dialog: two hundred yard range, so when they're close
dialog: enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive
text: rounds over our walls and pound us to dust.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: They look to be three hundred yards out.
dialog: You have three days.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Bloody murderers.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: A man, here, can make a run straight through
dialog: to Webb.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: ... not enough time to get to Albany and back
dialog: with reinforcements ...
text: A Sergeant enters, snaps to attention, says something to Beams, exits.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to
dialog: Fort Edward two days ago.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Webb's at Edward?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Only twelve miles away! He could be here day
dialog: after tomorrow.
dialog: (to Hawkeye)
dialog: Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you
dialog: the message.
text: Beams nods. Munro turns back to the map. Hawkeye has something else to say.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: John Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last
dialog: night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And
dialog: it was Ottawa. They're allied to the French.
text: Munro looks at him.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: It was a war party. It means they're on the
text: attack up and down the frontier.
text: Munro turns to look at him for a long beat. Munro doesn't like what his response must
text: be to this news. He turns to Heyward and the map.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (cold)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Hawkeye's dismissed, frozen out.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: Many men here, their homes are in the path.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: That's all, sir.
text: Hawkeye is furious. Chingachgook gestures Hawkeye out. He leaves Munro's quarters
text: almost knocking over an entering Adjutant who backs way up to let Chingachgook
dialog: pass.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Things were done. Nobody was spared ...
speaker_heading: MUNRO
text: Terrible feature of war in the Americas.
dialog: (beat; a mantra)
dialog: Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.

dialog: are not the first and closest to my father's campfire.
text: The Marquis de Montcalm is forty-five, wears a large wampum belt as a sash over his

text: Munro, but a consummate professional soldier. Over the Seneca's shoulder, Montcalm
text: sees and nods to ...
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: entering with four Huron braves. This is not the Magua we saw on the trail. In his scalp
text: lock, now red-stained and cut to a Huron roach, are three blacl plumes. A match-coat
text: blanket drapes his left shoulder.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: (to Seneca Chief)
dialog: For my children and the children of the true
dialog: faith, my friendship and esteem is boundless ...
dialog: I will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow
dialog: I, myself, will sing the war song with you in the
dialog: great council house.
text: The Seneca Chief is satisfied and his people, plus the Jesuit, exit. The look on Magua's
text: face and the wry expression on Montcalm's allows us to understand their relationship is
dialog: based on realpolitik.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your
dialog: English friends?
text: Magua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face Montcalm and sits, European
dialog: style ...
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: (over his shoulder)
dialog: Louis Antoine, join us.
text: LOUIS ANTOINE DE BOUGAINVILLE enters. He wears a functional melange of

speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Hear what le Subtil has to tell us ...
dialog: Bougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty-five, at twenty-six was a
dialog: secretary to the French Ambassador in London, in January 1756 at twenty-seven he
dialog: was elected a member of the British Royal Academy of Science and at age twenty-eight
text: he's aide de camp to the Marquis de Montcalm with the rank of captain. Later in life, he

speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: The Grey Hair will try.
speaker_heading: BOUGAINVILLE
dialog: Four or five, including two women entered the

speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's

speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat

speaker_heading: PHELPS
dialog: First assisted me in Austria when she was
dialog: fourteen. I would say she does ...
text: Her apron is stained. Hawkeye sees this may be her first time in the New World, but it's

dialog: nevertheless falling for Cora.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: She does not shy away from much ...

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Uncas)
dialog: You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro?
text: Uncas laughs, looking from her to Hawkeye. Then he's up and he hurts. Cora starts to
text: tend another wounded man. As they start out, Hawkeye hesitates. Sensing it, Cora
dialog: turns.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Why, I am looking at you, Miss.

text: One Canadien's falling through the trees as the second one's hit by Uncas' shot.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: reaches out his hand. Killdeer with the heavier load is slapped into it. Hawkeye aims.
text: Looks away a second and comes back to the sight in deep concentration. The world
dialog: goes silent ...
scene_heading: HAWKEYE'S POV: COURIER &amp; CANADIEN
text: pursuer are barely visible. Only patches appear momentarily between the trees. They're
text: three hundred yards away: an impossible shot in 1757.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FOREST - THE CANADIEN

scene_heading: EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - HAWKEYE

speaker_heading: JUMP CUT BACK:
speaker_heading: TREES
text: Hawkeye's heavy round rips through. We HEAR the ball cut air. A few leaves flutter ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FOREST - CANADIEN
text: whacked head over heels by the impact.
speaker_heading: COURIER
text: looks over his shoulder. He didn't know the Canadien was there. He stumbles in the

dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - WEST SALLY-PORT
text: The three companies of the 62nd Regiment of Foot file back into the fort in perfect

speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Sergeant Major!
speaker_heading: SERGEANT MAJOR
dialog: Sir!
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT MAJOR
dialog: Atten-hut!
scene_heading: TROOPERS &amp; MILITIA
dialog: have seen no action for three days &amp; nights. Heyward got their blood running and won

dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR MUNRO'S BEDCHAMBER - DOOR - NIGHT
text: a knock and Heyward enters.
speaker_heading: CORA &amp; ALICE
text: Alice is in her father's bed. Cora is collecting and tearing linen into strips for bandaging.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll
dialog: come back another time ...
text: Alice looks at the two of them and rises out of the bed.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Alice ...
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ...
dialog: I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.
dialog: (starts
dialog: for door)
dialog: I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ...
text: She leaves.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ...
speaker_heading: CORA
text: Her nerves are shattered. She's trying
dialog: to be brave.
text: There's a lot going on under Cora's surface. We don't know what it is, but it's
dialog: disconcerting.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Cora, I adore you and, when we come together,
dialog: we will be the happiest couple in England ...
dialog: I am certain of that. More than ever before.
dialog: (softens)
dialog: I believe you must trust the judgment of others
dialog: who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Duncan ...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Duncan, I promised you an answer. You
dialog: have complimented me with your persistence
dialog: and patience ... But the decision I've come
dialog: to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes
dialog: than surrender my own judgment.
text: Heyward is stunned.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: And it's been unfair to you, while I search
dialog: myself for feelings, which, if they were
dialog: there and as strong as they ought to be,
dialog: would've made themselves known long ago ...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan.
dialog: And please take this as my final answer.
dialog: It must be no.
dialog: Heyward' shattered inside.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: I see ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: I am sorry, Duncan ...
text: Heyward nods. He's speechless. He's errect as he leaves the room.
speaker_heading: CLOSE: CORA
text: The tension rushes out of her and she shudders and leans against the quarter-timbered
text: walls for support. Then she collects the linen and starts out.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR FORT, INNER CORRIDOR - CORA
text: moving through the corridor past wounded. Two French mortar bombs explode above
text: one of the casements. We hear shrill screams in the distance and ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE (O.S.)
dialog: ... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. The
text: cabin was attacked by a war party. They are
text: sweeping south down the frontier spreading
dialog: terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos
dialog: all the men are here.
speaker_heading: IAN (O.S.)
dialog: And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of
dialog: Cameron's!
text: Cora, passing the open door to Munro's crowded office, now hesitates.
speaker_heading: CORA'S POV: THE ROOM
text: Hawkeye, Captain Jack Winthrop, Ian, seven or eight other militia spokesmen, Munro,
text: Heyward, two adjutants, one lieutenant of Rangers.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: I must receive proof more conclusive than
dialog: Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our
text: defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken
dialog: together, that's gospel. Your fort will	 stand
dialog: or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements,
dialog: not these colonials' presence.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: That judgment is not more important than their
dialog: right under agreement with Webb to defend their
dialog: farms &amp; families ... Major Heyward was at John
text: Cameron's. He saw what it was.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (looking to Heyward for
dialog: confirmation of his point of view)
dialog: What did you see, Major?
text: Heyward looks around the room. And he catches the doorway ...
speaker_heading: CORA
text: beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
dialog: At the same time ...
speaker_heading: CORA
text: examines him with a cool, level stare.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: looks at Munro. More French rounds detonate O.S. What if Webb gets here and they
dialog: need to launch a counter-attack? They need every man they have. It's his moment of
dialog: decision ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (to Munro)
dialog: I saw nothing that would lead me to the
dialog: conclusion it was other than a raid by savages
text: bent on thievery.
text: Jack Winthrop grabs Nathaniel.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You're a liar!
speaker_heading: CORA'S
text: saddened. Heyward's stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: can't help it. He turns to look at Cora ...
scene_heading: HEYWARD'S POV: DOORWAY
text: She's gone.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: suffused with an inner sadness, turns to Hawkeye.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: And the blood is on your hands!
text: Heyward reaches for his sword.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (to Heyward)
dialog: I'll have none of that!
dialog: (to colonials)
dialog: Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman.
dialog: Not a butcher.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Easy for you to suppose. While it is their
dialog: women and children, not yours, alone in
dialog: their farms!
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: You forget yourself!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: British promises are honored. And the militia
dialog: will not be released. Because I need more
dialog: definite proof than this man's word!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a
dialog: long time before you got here!
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: This interview's over! The militia stays!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (to Munro)
dialog: Does the rule of English law no longer govern?
dialog: Has it been replaced by absolutism?
dialog: This is very dangerous talk.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe
dialog: these people would do better makin' a peace
dialog: with the French!
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: That is sedition! Treason!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: That is the truth!
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (restaining himself)
dialog: I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Major!
dialog: (changes down)
dialog: Some day I think you and I are gonna have
text: a serious disagreement.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (steel)
dialog: Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving
dialog: Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition.
dialog: Anyone leaving will be shot for desertion.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: My decision is final. Get out.
text: Hawkeye and the others are not intimidated. Their rage smolders. The look on
text: Hawkeye's face says this is not over.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FORT, PARADE GROUND - BONFIRE - NIGHT
text: Sparks shower skyward. Impromptu music. Some Celtic proto-bluegrass played on
text: fiddle &amp; drums. It's stirring.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE: SOME WOMEN
text: laundresses, dance from soldier to soldier - English foot and American Rangers. A few
text: people lit by the firelight are solemn. Most are stirred to lift their morale for a while.
speaker_heading: THEIR FACES
text: underlit by the red firelight. They are a disposable people, a diverse plurality stuck in a
text: postage stamp-size fort in an ocean of forest, locked into mortal deadly conflict
dialog: because of the policies of cold and distant European monarchs.
text: A PLACE A LITTLE DISTANT FROM THE FIRE
text: We can barely make out the eyes and faces of a number of men behind logs, crates and
text: new wreckage from the day's bombardment.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (low)
dialog: ... got no kin in the settlements. If I did,
dialog: I'd be long gone.
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: You didn't think it right to be here in the
dialog: first place.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: By my light that's how I saw it then and I
dialog: see it that way now ...
speaker_heading: IAN
dialog: (low)
dialog: But we are under English military authority.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (low)
dialog: I believe if they set aside their law as and when
dialog: they wish, their law no longer has rightful
dialog: authority over us. All they have over us is
dialog: tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.
dialog: No force on earth will keep me here ... Anyone
dialog: caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each
dialog: man make your own decision ... Those who
dialog: are goin', be back here in an hour.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east
dialog: side of the swamp until you clear the French
text: picket line. Head north over the ridge, then
dialog: come about southeast and fork left in Little
dialog: Meadow and you're free of the outpost and
dialog: skirmishers ...
speaker_heading: A COLONIAL
dialog: (grumbles)
dialog: Should've skinned outta this long ago.
speaker_heading: COLONIAL #2
dialog: Got no families, Captain. Figured we'd stay
dialog: and give 'em a hand even though ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Colonial #2)
dialog: I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (in amazement)
dialog: You're not coming with us?
text: Hawkeye shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Got a reason to stay.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That reason wear a blue dress and work
dialog: in the surgery?
dialog: Low laughter
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (dry)
dialog: It does and it is a better lookin' reason
dialog: than you, Jack Winthrop.
dialog: (more laughs)
dialog: Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French
text: outpost by dawn.
text: (sticks out his hand and
dialog: grasps Winthrop's)
dialog: Good luck, Jack.
dialog: The men split up ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
speaker_heading: FIRE - HAWKEYE
text: wanders among the dancers and musicians clustered in groups, lit by the firelight.
text: Someone catches his eye and he moves in that direction ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE'S POV: CORA
text: in the shadows, leaning against the wall, searching ... we sense she's been looking
text: for him. He comes up to her. She turns in surprise.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Somehow she breathes easier because he's there. She's in a white shirt with the sleeves
text: rolled up. Hawkeye leads her away from some of the people.
speaker_heading: CORA &amp; HAWKEYE
text: Hawkeye takes Cora's hand. Cora is awakening to a new spirit, a new wind blowing
text: through a new land, a new self-determination ... She's drawn to this rough yet graceful
text: man with his direct manner. Hawkeye settles against a wall. She leans next to him.
text: Their shoulders touch.
speaker_heading: CORA
text: To her everything about him seems to be somehow right. She's discovered that the
text: passions and outrage that move him, move her ... And her readiness to give herself to
text: what stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: looks at her. She's beautiful in the firelight. Cora's eyes find his and she folds into his
text: arms. His lips find hers and tears stream down her face. She's suffused with an elation
text: she can't explain. In the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid the
text: huddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black earth of the forests of a
dialog: wild continent.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR BARRACKS - LOW &amp; WIDE - DAY

dialog: You! Halt!
speaker_heading: BRITISH SENTRIES
text: their muskets aimed mostly at Hawkeye.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: As you were!!
text: Hawkeye freezes. The others slow down, indecisive ... Hawkeye drops his tomahawk
text: and says something in Mohican to restrain Chingachgook and Uncas. The British in the
text: torchlight with the long muskets and bayonets are an image out of Goya.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Take him!
text: Hawkeye's spun around and while his hands are bound.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: (Mohican; subtitled)
dialog: Why do they make my son prisoner?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (Mohican; subtitled)
dialog: I helped Winthrop and the others leave ...
dialog: This fight is not yours, father. I love
dialog: you and my brother. And you should leave
dialog: this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee ...
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: (Mohican; subtitled)
dialog: What will they do with my white son?
text: One of the guards - scared to death by Chingachgook - nervously fingers his musket.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Get back from him!
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: enters.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

scene_heading: INTERIOR MUNRO'S QUARTERS - CORA - DAY
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: He saved us! We are alive only because
dialog: of him ...
speaker_heading: WIDEN:
text: Heyward, Munro, Cora. We've entered mid-argument. An adjutant comes and goes.
text: Heyward and Munro are sensitive to appearances in front of the adjutant. Cora couldn't
dialog: give a damn.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: The man encouraged the colonials to desert
dialog: in this very room, in my presence. He is
dialog: guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged
dialog: like any other criminal, regardless of what he
dialog: did for my children.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: He knew the consequences. And he stayed.
dialog: Are those the actions of a criminal?
dialog: ... Duncan, do something.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.
dialog: He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: You know he wouldn't send me ...! You
dialog: misrepresented what you saw and caused
dialog: this.
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ...
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Not with enough certainty to outweigh British
dialog: interests in this fort.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: And who empowered these provincials to pass
dialog: judgment upon England's policies in her own
dialog: colonies? To come and go without so much as
dialog: a "by your leave."
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: They do not live their lives "by your leave."
text: ... They hack it out of the wilderness with
text: their own two hands, burying their dead and
text: their children along the way.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (distant)
dialog: You are defending him because you've become
text: infatuated with him.
text: Cora is having her intelligence written off as a hormone attack. She contains her fury.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable
dialog: qualities. But taken as a whole, I was wrong
dialog: to have thought so highly of you.
text: Heyward's shot through the heart.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: But the man is guilty of sedition and subject
dialog: to military justice and beyond pardon.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: "Justice"? If that's "justice" ..., then the
dialog: sooner French guns blow the English army
dialog: out of America, the better it will be for
dialog: these people.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: You do not know what you are saying!
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (explodes)
dialog: Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.
dialog: And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of
dialog: sedition, too!
text: She exits, leaving them there.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR FORT, STOCKADE - NIGHT
text: Heavy timbered door. A sentry. They stand at attention when Cora passes as opposed
text: to barring her entry.
scene_heading: INTERIOR CELL - HAWKEYE
text: comes to the door, grips the bars with his hands and looks at Cora.
text: THROUGH THE BARS TO CORA
text: They are silent for a moment, then ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Sorry ... can't ask you in.
text: Cora's pale smile.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: They're going to hang you.
dialog: (pause; soft)
dialog: Why didn't you leave when you had the
dialog: chance?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Because what I am interested in is right
dialog: here ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: What would you have me do?
text: He touches her hand.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.
dialog: If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If
dialog: that happens, stay close to your father.
dialog: The French will protect the officer class
dialog: among the English.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: No. I will find you.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Do not.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Promise me.
text: Cora drops her forehead to Hawkeye's hands wrapped around the bars. She acquiesces,
text: nods. Then HEAVY SHELLING commences. Cora &amp; Hawkeye look up. Mortar
text: bombs begin striking the fortress. Still dark. The final French bombardment has
dialog: started.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: The whole world's on fire, isn't it?
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: This part of it sure is ...
text: Reaching through the bars set in the thick door, their hands clasp each others. On that
dialog: image ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - VARIOUS CUTS - DAWN (2ND UNIT)
text: French cannoneers in Batteries #1 and #2 fire again and again. They work like precision
dialog: drill teams.
speaker_heading: FRENCH TRENCH
text: ending in Battery #3 is complete and surprisingly close to William Henry's walls. Crews
text: reload the squat and massive newly arrived thirteen inch mortars.
speaker_heading: MORTAR ONE
text: The flash-hole is primed. The burning fuse is jammed into the bomb. The primer charge
text: is lit off and the crew ducks as the crude iron belches red flame and black smoke into
text: the lightening sky. The second mortar ROARS. Then a THIRD.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - ENGLISH CANNON CREW - NIGHT
text: tries to return fire but can't under the heavy French bombardment. The French mortar
text: bomb arcs in and EXPLODES smoke, flame and shrapnel, wiping out most of the
text: crew. The fortress is under the heaviest attack we've seen. Wounded are in shock or
text: terrorized. Another mortar bomb arcs in and explodes part of a building and casement,
text: starting a fire.
text: Another lands in the grounds. People scatter. It doesn't explode. One soldier dashes to
text: rip out the fuse. As his hand is inches away ... EXPLOSION.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR STOCKADE - HAWKEYE - DAWN - LATER
text: protects Cora through the bars as she half sleeps through the muffled roar. Then the
text: thundering stops. Hawkeye seperates himself from her and crosses to the window.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - HAWKEYES POV: CHEVALIER DE LEVIS
text: bows deeply to Major Beams. A French honor guard of five men is behind him. A white
text: scarf is on his sword tip. The fresh destruction of the fort is apparent. Debris smolders.
scene_heading: INTERIOR FORT - STOCKADE - HAWKEYE
text: crosses to an awakened Cora. He touches her face. He's desperate to drill these next
text: words into her brain.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: I don't know. Whatever happens you stay
dialog: with your father. You stay among the officers.
text: Cora looks up at Hawkeye. We feel forboding. O.S. are heard drums ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - MUNRO, HEYWARD, BEAMS - DAY
text: The drums are from Munro's honor guard. They stop.
scene_heading: REVERSE: FRENCH SOLDIERS
text: Marquis de Montcalm, immaculate, backed by his guard of honor in white, grey and
text: medium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental colors and the French flag (gold
text: fleur-de-lis on a field of blue).
speaker_heading: FACES
text: They carried two hundred and forty-five bateaux across a ten mile portage, all their
text: supplies and artillery, and then rowed down the length of Lake George to get here. To 	them, assaulting this fort is the easy part. The drummers of the honor guard play a
text: tattoo behind them.
speaker_heading: INDIAN FACES
text: Huron, Ottawa, Osage, Choctaw, Fox ... hear the drum of the honor guard and wait.
text: They're in war paint. Many tattoos. Split ears. The Osage scalping locks are hennaed
text: red. Canadiens among them are bearded, dirty, half savage ... At their head ...
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: in full war paint, with a coterie of Huron warriors, silent, waiting. Drums.
scene_heading: INTERIOR FORT - ENGLISH TROOPS (TABLEAUX)
text: grim, silent, watchful.
scene_heading: COLONIAL MILITIA &amp; MOHAWK INDIANS IN WAR PAINT (TABLEAUX)
text: watching the parlay from a blown apart battery. Silent.
scene_heading: WIDE: FRENCH &amp; ENGLISH
text: and their honor guards. Montcalm steps forward and sweeps his plumed hat to the

speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant
dialog: antagonist. I am happy to make your
dialog: acquaintance as a friend.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Please accept my compliments for the strong
dialog: and skillful defense of your fortress. Under
dialog: the command of a lesser man it would have
dialog: fallen long ago given the superior numbers and
dialog: material ... mere chance has allowed me to
dialog: array against you ...
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a
dialog: diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: You have already done everything which is
dialog: necessary for the honor of your Prince. I
dialog: will forever bear testimony that your resistance
dialog: has been gallant and was continued as long as
dialog: there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen
dialog: to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to
dialog: consider my terms for your surrender.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: However I may apprise such testimony from
dialog: Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is
text: strong and stands.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may
dialog: be refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to
dialog: us every opportunity to reconnoiter your
dialog: works and I am possibly as well acquainted
dialog: with your weak condition as you are yourselves.
text: Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British
dialog: reinforcements arrive?
speaker_heading: MUNRO
text: Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the
dialog: Hudson and he knows the size and imminence
dialog: of the army of Webb ...?
text: Montcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to Munro.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended
dialog: for you.
text: Munro is puzzled, suspicious.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: (to Bougainville)
dialog: Read the dispatch.
scene_heading: HEYWARD &amp; MUNRO]
speaker_heading: BOUGAINVILLE
speaker_heading: (O.S. - reading)
dialog: "Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have
dialog: no men available to send to your rescue. It is
dialog: impossible. I advise you to seek terms for
dialog: surrender. Signed Webb."
text: Munro is rocked, as if struck by a blow. Bougainville hands Heyward the letter.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (confirming)
dialog: This is the signature of Webb.
dialog: (to Munro)
dialog: And I know the temper of our men. Rather
dialog: than spend the war in a French prison hulk
dialog: in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (to Montcalm)
dialog: You have heard your answer, Monsieur le
dialog: Marquis.
dialog: (salutes)
text: Munro starts off. Montcalm stops him.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Sir.
dialog: (challengingly)
dialog: I am incapable of mistreating brave men.
dialog: I beg you not to sign the death warrant
dialog: of so many until you have listened to my
dialog: terms.
dialog: Munro turns.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Such as ...?
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: My master requires the fort be destroyed.
dialog: But, for you and your comrades, there is
dialog: no privilege that will be denied. None of
dialog: your men will see the inside of a prison
dialog: barge. They're free to go so long as they
dialog: return to England and fight no more on this
text: continent, and the civilian militia return to
dialog: their farms.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Their arms?
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
text: They may leave the fortress fully armed, but
dialog: with no ammunition ... Other than that, ask
dialog: what you wish.
text: Munro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: The honors of war?
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Granted.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: My colors?
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Carry them to England to your King with pride.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Allow me to consult with my officers.
text: As he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that can never get put
text: back together. As the men move away from the French ...
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: I have lived to see two things I never expected.
text: An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And
dialog: a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back
dialog: and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our
dialog: mission is to fight.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (flares)
dialog: Death and honor are sometimes thought to be
dialog: the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
text: Munro looks at the fortress behind him.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Sir!
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (stops him with his eyes)
dialog: The decision is final.
text: A beat. Then Munro turns toward Montcalm. Their eyes meet across the churned,
text: scarred earth of the battlefield.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: I am deeply touched by such unusual and
dialog: unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours
dialog: under the condition that we be given until
dialog: dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and
dialog: women for their march and turn our wounded
dialog: over to your surgeon.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Granted, Monsieur.
text: And Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - CLOAKED MAN - NIGHT
text: passes away from the little city of tents in the direction of the beach and towards
text: William Henry. He seems to head towards a vantage point from which to observe the
text: fort. As he approaches a sentry:
speaker_heading: SENTRY
dialog: Qui vive?
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: France.
speaker_heading: SENTRY
dialog: Le mot d'ordre?
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: La victoire.
speaker_heading: SENTRY
dialog: C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin,
dialog: monsieur!
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
text: The cloak parts. By the light of the moon the man's face is dimly perceived by us and
text: the soldier as General Montcalm. The soldier snaps erect as Montcalm continues
text: walking out beyond the line to a small stand of trees.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE: MONTCALM
text: The moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind Montcalm; from the
text: front of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: Is the hatchet buried between the English
dialog: and my French father?
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men
dialog: become friends.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: My master owns these lands and your father
dialog: has been ordered to drive off the English
dialog: squatters. They have consented to go. So
dialog: now he calls them enemies no longer.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.
text: It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will
dialog: be buried.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: But so many suns have set since Le Renard
dialog: struck the war post. Is he not tired?
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.
text: It is dark and cold. It has set on his people,
text: they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell
dialog: all of their lands to enrich the European masters
dialog: who are always greedy for more than they need.
dialog: (threatening)
dialog: And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have
dialog: been many clouds and many mountains. But now
dialog: he has come to lead his nation.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: That Le Renard has the power to lead his people
dialog: into the light, I know well.
text: Magua grabs the hand of the French commander. Imperceptible surprise in Montcalm's
text: eyes. Magua jams Montcalm's fingers to his chest.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: Does my father know that?
speaker_heading: MAGUA'S CHEST
text: A deep indentation and scar.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: And this?
text: Magua turns his naked back to Montcalm and puts Montcalm's hand on his back ... 	deep ridges of a scar a half inch wide.]
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: My son has been sadly injured. Who did
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: (laughs; sardonic)
text: Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.
dialog: And the sticks left their mark ...
dialog: (pause; for real)
text: Magua's village and lodges were burnt.
dialog: Magua's children were killed by the English.
dialog: Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks
dialog: who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife
dialog: believed he was dead and became the wife of
dialog: another. The Grey Hair was the father of all
dialog: this.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk
dialog: to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.
dialog: And his heart will be whole again on the day
dialog: when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: My son Magua's pain is my pain.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: Does the chief of the Canadas believe the
dialog: English will keep the terms?
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: Munro would. But General Webb will not
text: send their soldiers across the salt lake.
dialog: Having let them go, I fear I will only fight
dialog: the same men again when I move south.
dialog: (pause; shrugs)
dialog: And yet, I cannot break the terms of the
dialog: capitulation and sully the lilies of France ...
text: Long pause, wheels turn. Then:
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: Many things my French father cannot do,
dialog: Magua can.
text: Montcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
dialog: As the English march away, our soldiers
dialog: and the Canadiens will be drawn to the
text: looting of the fort ... except for a small
dialog: guard ...
text: Magua abruptly leaves Montcalm.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR WOODS - MAGUA - NIGHT
text: walking back to the Huron camp. Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been in the woods,
text: waiting for Magua. Now he joins him. They walk in silence. Then ...
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: (in Iroquois; re: Montcalm)
dialog: I wonder at the blindness and pride of the
dialog: white man. He believes only he knows
dialog: how to speak falsely to make other men do
dialog: his bidding.
text: Magua exhales in derision.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - MUNRO - DAY
text: at the end of the column, rides out on his horse. Both sides of the gate are jammed with
text: armed French troops standing at attention. The French colors and honor guard are just
text: outside the gate along with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as
text: is - at the head - Montcalm.
speaker_heading: CLOSER: MUNRO
text: trots past his walking column out the gate. He does not look at the French.
speaker_heading: MONTCALM
text: salutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle.
speaker_heading: CLOSER: MUNRO
text: salutes Montcalm.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: (eyes forward)
dialog: Monsieur, the fort is yours.
scene_heading: MID-COLUMN - ON HEYWARD
text: marching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort. The French troops have
text: thinned out. Repressing shame, his backbone is rigid, his face is straight ahead. The
text: 33rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum. In the B.G. Munro on his horse passes
text: Heyward as he rides towards the front of his column. Heyward does not look at him.
scene_heading: FRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE
text: on the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under
text: the arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is
text: seen approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks down the column,
text: sheilding her eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye.
scene_heading: CORA'S POV: THE COLUMN
dialog: The 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to forty women and a
text: number of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and
text: many Mohawk, walking wounded. The column is still snaking its way out of the fort.
dialog: No Hawkeye.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: straining to see.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS
text: being assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. He stands
text: erect, walking out of the gate. The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior.
text: Hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ...
scene_heading: UNCAS &amp; CHINGACHGOOK
text: on the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own
text: musket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye.
text: Their eyes connect... We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration.
scene_heading: RANK AND FILE FRENCH
text: A few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. It's just talk.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE
text: His eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. The path cuts
text: through the forested hills ahead. He sees ...
scene_heading: HAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA
text: riding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. Only a few scattered and
text: curious Huron and Ottawa. She does not see him.
scene_heading: PROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH &amp; WIDE
text: as it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley. We're
text: shooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both
text: slopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out
text: and don't constitute a threat. They watch the column.
text: SLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a large man
text: wearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked. He
text: is heavily war-painted ...
speaker_heading: FRONTAL - MAGUA
text: and the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right third is painted black. Much
text: silver is in his ears. His tomahawk is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right
text: fist. Magua's attention is all focused to one point.
scene_heading: MAGUA'S LONG &amp; TIGHT POV: MUNRO &amp; CORA &amp; ALICE
text: at the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention.
scene_heading: WIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS &amp; MUNROS
text: Cora turns again to look for Hawkeye.
speaker_heading: CLOSER: CORA
text: doesn't see him, but something else has caught her eye.
speaker_heading: YOUNG HURON
text: running toward the column. Just one man. No musket. He's running and whooping like
text: a dog charging from his master's front yard. Why?
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: the Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a
text: British trooper who falls dead. The single Huron never breaks stride. He simply runs off
dialog: again ...
speaker_heading: CORA
text: horrified, holds Alice tighter.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: has seen it too. And now he sees ...
scene_heading: 62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT
text: fixing bayonets. A large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, facing the Hurons
dialog: and other Indians ...
speaker_heading: TROOPERS
dialog: of the 33rd present arms. Did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition? Locks
dialog: are cocked. There's the answer.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Steady! No one fires!
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FORESTED HILLSIDES - OTHER TRIBES
dialog: are watching what happens.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: scanning them.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (to Sergeant Major)
dialog: Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
speaker_heading: SERGEANT MAJOR
dialog: Yes sir!
text: Drums beat the cadence.
speaker_heading: TROOPERS
text: step over the fallen soldier. Heads turn, they're on edge ...
scene_heading: END OF COLUMN - HAWKEYE, UNCAS &amp; CHINGACHGOOK
text: watching. They exchange looks. This is not good. Chingachgook cocks both Killdeer
text: and his own musket.
scene_heading: HAWKEYE'S POV: FORESTED SLOPES
text: Hold. We start to make out details in the shadow. Tree trunks. We become accustomed
text: to the dimness. Now in the lower light we see deeper in the forest.
speaker_heading: CLOSER
text: Many Huron and Ottawa are hidden in the shadows. They're moving along parallel to
text: the column, stalking it. Waiting ...
speaker_heading: ANOTHER BRAVE
text: racing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the 62nd.
speaker_heading: TWO SOLDIERS
text: look at their sergeant. He nods. They wait until he's within ten feet of the column. Both

scene_heading: EXTERIOR HILLSIDES - HURON &amp; OTTAWA
dialog: saw what happened. But, they hold their ranks.
speaker_heading: MOHAWKS
text: among the British are slipping tomahawks into their hands, surreptitiously. Some are
text: cocking flintlocks.
speaker_heading: MUNRO
text: gallops his horse away from Cora and Alice towards the scene of the last attack. We
text: hear him from the distance ordering ...
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Do not break ranks! I want these ranks
dialog: to hold ...!
text: Cora's frightened.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE'S
text: frustrated. He saw Munro leave Cora. He knows events have a momentum and it's
text: accelerating.
scene_heading: CHINGACHGOOK &amp; UNCAS

speaker_heading: WOMEN

scene_heading: EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA
text: His eyes see Munro.
scene_heading: WIDER &amp; LOWER: MAGUA
text: raises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop. WE NOW SEE ... hundreds have
text: been stalking the column, hidden in the trees, maybe thousands. Then ...
scene_heading: WIDE: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE
text: FIRE from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous and massive
text: ambush of mostly Hurons. They appear from behind every tree and it turns to a ROAR
text: of musket fire, war whoops and screams as ...
speaker_heading: SOLDIERS &amp; CIVILIANS
text: dropping like flies and seemingly thousands of Hurons attack down both slopes.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: is being unshackled by Uncas. The sergeant is rising from the ground where
text: Chingachgook knocked him. Chingachgook throws Hawkeye Killdeer and Hawkeye
text: shrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he races with Uncas for the head of the
dialog: column ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA
text: charging down the hill ... with his coterie of twenty Huron warriors, heading for the
dialog: area in which he saw Munro.
speaker_heading: CORA &amp; ALICE

speaker_heading: SERGEANT MAJOR

speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Fire!
text: As the line of muskets belch smoke and fire ...
scene_heading: WIDE: THE HILLS &amp; PATH
text: We're shooting into the "v" of the valley with Hurons and other tribes pouring down
text: from both sides. (IMPORTANT: the combined musket fire of Hurons, English and

text: views, isolate pockets of combat into surreal tableaux that we'll move in and out of.
speaker_heading: BRITISH TROOPERS
text: using their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets - as the smoke and fog

speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: glides through the scenes, striking and hunting. Some of his coterie of braves near him.
dialog: He sees ...
speaker_heading: BLONDE WOMAN
text: hugging the ground in fear. Magua throws her over. It's not Alice Munro. It's a woman

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: running through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two hundred yards away.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Cora!
text: Chingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with his war club.
speaker_heading: CORA &amp; ALICE
text: running through the chaos and murder and British troopers and Mohawks locked in
text: struggle with Hurons. Cora's dress is torn. She holds Alice to her. There's a pistol in
text: Cora's hand.
speaker_heading: ONE HURON
text: scalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, turns and faces us.
speaker_heading: CORA
text: shoots him in the face.
scene_heading: EXTREMELY CLOSE: ALICE
text: and her eyes take it all in. And her affect starts to flatten. A blankness suffuses her
text: expression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: locked in combat. He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing downstroke and
text: comes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand
dialog: fires Killdeer at ...
speaker_heading: HURON
text: six feet from Uncas and about to shoot him in the back.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: free for a moment, spins. He has no idea of direction any more. Everything is death in
text: strange tableaux. Meanwhile:
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: hollering
speaker_heading: MUNRO
dialog: Cora! Alice!
text: He cuts down a Huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him from the right. An
text: Osage warrior with red scalp-lock leaps on the back of Munro's horse, reaching over to
text: stab down into Munro's neck. The old man's left hand grabs the warrior's knife hand in
text: an iron grip. His right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires
text: backward, point blank, blowing the Osage off the back of his horse.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Just then Munro's mount is shot. His horse rears up, throws Munro and falls on him.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: shouting orders over the deafening noise.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Second rank fire! Six paces back! Prime!
dialog: Load! Third rank! Present!
text: A well-oiled, well-drilled fighting machine, but there are fewer of them. They're getting
text: cut off. They close ranks automatically as a man drops. They're retreating in perfect
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: HURON WARRIOR
text: about to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by Magua.
speaker_heading: CLOSER: MAGUA
text: His eyes drop to what's in front of him. The field goes quiet.
scene_heading: OVER MAGUA'S SHOULDER: MUNRO
text: his lower body is trapped under his dead horse. Magua leans in towards him.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: Grey Hair. I will cut your heart from your
dialog: living chest in front of your eyes. As you die,
dialog: know that I will put under the knife your
dialog: children and wipe your seed from this earth
dialog: forever ...
text: Magua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards Munro ...
speaker_heading: MOHAWK &amp; HURON
text: spin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives. The Huron goes down
text: and then the Mohawk is shot. The Huron who shot him is cut down by a Ranger with
text: tomahawk in one hand and bayonet in the other. Two Mohawks and three Rangers
text: fighting back to back. They become an island swamped by Huron and Ottawa: amidst
text: bodies and ground slippery with blood. As smoke obscures their image.
speaker_heading: CORA &amp; ALICE
text: in a group of civilian militia. Two of the militiamen are shot down. The third engages a
text: Fox warrior. Cora &amp; Alice run.
speaker_heading: MUNRO'S FACE
text: frozen in agony by shock.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: reaching down and up into something, emerges and jams an object we barely see into
text: the air. But his arm and shoulder and half his chest are splashed red with blood.
speaker_heading: LONG SHOT: MAGUA

speaker_heading: REVERSE: HAWKEYE
dialog: saw him and fights his way to attack when ...
speaker_heading: WHITE HORSE
text: crazed, CRASHES through men, knocking Hawkeye over ...
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: protecting Hawkeye, slams his war club into one Huron, breaking his attack, his arm
text: and his skull and swings the other way burying the bladed end into the chest of an

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE'S
text: up, looking wildly ...
text: CAMERA JAMS INTO CLEARING SMOKE:

speaker_heading: CLOSER: HEYWARD
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Six paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two,
dialog: present! Rank two, hold!
text: He grabs a partially loaded musket, the ramrod still in the barrel. They're taking fire.
text: Men are dying. They're being pushed back.
speaker_heading: AN ABNAKI
text: wearing a large cross, attacks Heyward from the side. One-handed, Heyward fires the
text: musket into the man's chest, sending the ramrod through him. Then Heyward's shot in
text: the thigh and a thrown tomahawk hits him in the head and knocks him sideways.
text: Dazed. Barely able to stand. He uses the musket as a cane and ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Rank two, six paces back! Rank one,
dialog: present!
text: Rank two did not retreat six paces. They stand in confusion. Heyward looks to see
dialog: what's wrong.
text: HEYWARD'S POV: THE REMNANTS OF THE 33RD REGIMENT OF FOOT
text: are standing in water. They're up against Lake George. Their backs are to the wall. Last

speaker_heading: TWO FRENCH OFFICERS
text: on horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women. One French officer is shot
text: by a Huron. The other French officer runs through that Huron and shoots the second.
text: Then his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down ...
speaker_heading: JESUIT
text: pleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the legs in one hand. He offers
text: his cross. The Abnaki throws the baby to the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: sees a flash of something yellow. So does Hawkeye. They charge into the swirling
text: chaos of attacking bodies. As we lose sight of them ...
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: on her hands and knees. A massive Ottawa pulls her upright by her hair about to take
text: her life and her scalp. He's struck by a rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases
text: him. He bats her aside and returns to Alice, when suddenly ...
speaker_heading: OTTAWA WARRIOR
text: is spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye. Uncas has Alice and
dialog: Cora ...
text: TWO RANGERS AND A MOHAWK WARRIOR
text: from the earlier group are nearby. They combine with Hawkeye to fight their way out
text: with bayonets and tomahawks.
scene_heading: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO RANGERS, A MOHAWK &amp;
speaker_heading: MUNRO'S DAUGHTERS
text: back through the swirling smoke. There seems to be a lull. Then they're hit from the
text: side by musket fire. One of the Rangers is shot, the other wounded. Hurons attack. The
text: Mohawk supports the wounded Ranger.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: shields Cora as they back up.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: smashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for the man's musket and
text: shoots another. Then he sees ...
scene_heading: SMOKE DRIFTING OVER WATER
text: It's glass-smooth. And the bows are barely visible of three or four Huron war canoes.
scene_heading: THE SHALLOWS - HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK, UNCAS, CORA, ALICE,
dialog: THE RANGER &amp; THE MOHAWK
text: back into the water. They're pursued by Ottawa and Hurons as they fight their way to
dialog: the canoes.
speaker_heading: CORA
text: held up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: something underwater is pulling her down. An Ottawa brave rockets out of the
text: shallows. Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams him back into the water and FIRES.
speaker_heading: WOUNDED RANGER
text: has shoved a large birch canoe at them.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: Suddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face Hawkeye. His hands
text: rest on Hawkeye's shoulders. Hawkeye looks into his face. Tries to hold him up, tries
text: to rescue him. A frozen moment. Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and the man is staring
text: into Hawkeye's as the light goes out ... Hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float
text: away. He moves Cora and Alice towards the canoe ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE - WATER &amp; SWIRLING SMOKE - DAY
text: The bottom of the frame is water like glass. Smoke obscures the background. Fingers
text: tendril towards us. Out of the mist we HEAR small splashing and then the high bow of
text: a war canoe defines itself. It's paddled towards us.
scene_heading: HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK &amp; UNCAS
text: Cora's behind Hawkeye. Alice and the wounded Ranger are near Uncas.
scene_heading: CLOSER: HAWKEYE &amp; CORA

speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: spins.
text: HEYWARD &amp; TWO TROOPERS OF THE 33RD IN A SECOND CANOE
text: have emerged from the smoke ten feet from them. Heyward's aiming a horse pistol at
dialog: Hawkeye.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: is non-plussed. He doesn't stop paddling.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You got nothin' better to do today on
dialog: Lake George than shoot me, Major,
dialog: then go ahead ...
text: Heyward's a hair's breadth from firing. Suddenly they hear the boom of muskets and
dialog: rounds come in.
speaker_heading: WIDE
text: They're being pursued by three boatloads - and then a fourth and fifth - of Huron.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: is indifferent to Huron musket balls. Hawkeye hasn't stopped paddling and pays
dialog: Heyward no heed.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Stop it!!
text: Heyward comes to his senses. His head is gashed. A scarf, as a tourniquet, is tied
text: around his leg. He lowers the gun.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: When you fall into British hands again,
dialog: Nathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged.
speaker_heading: HURON CANOES
text: paddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake.
scene_heading: HAWKEYE &amp; HEYWARD'S CANOES
text: with less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be overtaken.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: looks to Uncas. They both realize the same thing. Hawkeye nods and he, Uncas &amp;
text: Chingachgook begin to paddle furiously. The others match the doubled pace. They're
text: sprinting ahead but the effort is exhausting.
speaker_heading: HURON CANOES
text: maintain their steady pace. Three or four Hurons fire.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE'S CANOE
text: Musket balls ricochet on the water's surface. One rips a hole through the bow.
text: Hawkeye sees one of the Redcoats in Heyward's canoe is giving out ...
speaker_heading: REDCOAT #1
dialog: Can't ... keep it up ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Pull!
text: He renews the attack on the water with the paddle.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD

dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Only chance we got is ...
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: ... to get more distance on 'em and go
dialog: to ground!
text: Heyward digs in. Like firecrackers in the distance, Huron muskets sound. A new hail
text: of musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes. One Redcoat is shot in the back. He falls

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: Pull!!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE CANOE

speaker_heading: CLOSE: HAWKEYE

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Pull ...!
text: More Huron musket balls hit water nearby.
speaker_heading: REDCOAT

scene_heading: HEYWARD &amp; REDCOAT'S POV: LAKE
text: divided by a spit of land. The right fork becomes a river with white water rapids.
scene_heading: HAWKEYE CANOE - HAWKEYE
text: paddling now, too, as they furiously jam for the white water that will shoot them way
dialog: ahead of the Hurons.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: leaps off the stern of Hawkeye's canoe and climbs up the stern of Heyward's and takes
text: control. He roughly gestures to the Redcoat and the Major to stop paddling. He and
text: Hawkeye will pilot the two canoes.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR WHITE WATER - WIDE - DAY
text: The canoes enter the white water and they're so light, they're jet-propelled.
scene_heading: CANOE POV: EIGHT FOOT WAVE
text: racing in the same direction they are. They hit it straight on and it shoots over them and
text: they're drenched by two waves coming from the sides.
scene_heading: HAWKEYE &amp; CHINGACHGOOK
text: paddle like fiends to get momentum and control.
speaker_heading: UNCAS' CANOE
text: Same thing. When they crested the wave Uncas hollers at them to "pull" and they do.
text: As soon as they're through it, Uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe
text: revolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through
dialog: stern-first or the stern becomes the bow, so that Uncas could pilot it a different way
dialog: through a hazard of ...
speaker_heading: EXPOSED ROCKS
text: jutting out of the water.
speaker_heading: WIDE - BOTH CANOES
text: Hawkeye didn't have to turn because Chingachgook, at the bow, uses his paddle to
text: shove the canoe away from jutting rocks. Uncas does the same. Past the jutting rocks,
text: Uncas swings it back around while ...
speaker_heading: WHITE WATER
text: smashes into the camera.
speaker_heading: ALICE &amp; CORA
text: as the canoe roller-coasters and water bursts the bow. Then suddenly it's through and
text: the water is miraculously smooth.
speaker_heading: CANOES
text: The Ranger, the Redcoats and even Heyward feel the exhilaration of the ride. That's
dialog: because they think they're home free.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Here's where it gets tricky ...
text: Heyward turns to look in front of him. He doesn't know what the hell Hawkeye's
dialog: talking about.
scene_heading: HEYWARD'S POV: THE RIVER AHEAD
text: looks glass-smoth. Although there is a distant ROAR of sorts. Then Heyward realizes:
dialog: something's wrong with this picture.
speaker_heading: CLOSER: HEYWARD
text: The look on his face starts to change.
scene_heading: HEYWARD'S POV: TIGHTER
text: The glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls off the end of the world. The
dialog: river just ends ...
scene_heading: BOTH CANOES: HEYWARD, REDCOATS, THE RANGER
text: realize they're heading for the lip of a waterfall. There's a couple of outcroppings of
text: rock in the center at the very edge. We are at Glen Falls.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Don't move ...
speaker_heading: AERIAL SHOT
text: from the other side of the falls. It's a two hundred foot high, death-defying cataract.
text: The canoes - slightly above us - will go right over.
speaker_heading: TWO CANOES
text: At the last moment, Hawkeye &amp; Uncas land both on either side of the larger rock
text: outcropping. It is literally at the lip of the falls.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: grabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe. He loses his grip. The canoe rockets for
dialog: the edge.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: lurches sideways, grabs a tree root. He is the only link of the canoe to earth. The bow,
text: with Heyward, is literally hanging over the edge. Uncas strains and pulls the canoe to
text: the rock. He gestures to Heyward.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: crawls forward and makes the island. Then the two Redcoats. Finally Uncas. The canoe
text: rockets over the falls. Meanwhile ...
text: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND
text: Hawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with driftwood and brush. As
text: they clamber over the high pieces of broken limestone, we see Hawkeye is slipping into
text: a crevice. He motions to Cora. Uncas carries the wounded Ranger. Heyward helps
dialog: Alice ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVES - FISSURE - TWILIGHT
text: The irregular opening of medium blue sky is obscured by the black silhouetted forms of
text: Hawkeye, Cora and then the others entering.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Where do we go from here?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: We don't.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: I don't understand!
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: This is it, as far as we can go ... If we're
dialog: lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have
dialog: come this way and must've beached our
dialog: canoes and headed cross land. If we're
dialog: very lucky, they'll figure we went over
dialog: the falls.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Then what?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Then we take the south rim down the
dialog: mountain and it's 12 miles cross country
dialog: to Fort Edward.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: And if we're unlucky?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: You will have to forego the pleasure of
dialog: hangin' me.
speaker_heading: REVERSE: WIDE
text: Hawkeye helps Cora; Heyward, the Ranger. Chingachgook carries Alice, down the
text: rockface into a cave. We hear a distant ROAR reverberating off the walls.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE: THE WALLS
text: are scooped out, bone-like hollows eroded by tumbling water. At an earlier time the
dialog: formation was part of the falls.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE &amp; CORA
text: reach the irregular floor of the chamber. The ROAR is louder.
scene_heading: WIDEN TO REVEAL
text: a curtain of falling water. They're behind the cataract, probably a third of the way down
text: its height. Light through the water stikes them with a silver luminescence. They're
text: exhausted. The others join them. They almost have to shout to be heard.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: followed by Uncas, takes stock of their supplies. They check their powder. They have
text: almost none. Uncas shares his with Hawkeye. The Redcoat's cartridge case is soaked,
text: the paper cartridges a soggy mess. Heyward has none. The Ranger has two left. In
text: Mohican, Chingachgook decides some things. Hawkeye and Uncas nod. Heyward
text: approaches Hawkeye.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Any powder?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE:
dialog: (crossing to Cora)
dialog: Only one or two loads.
speaker_heading: CORA
text: is soaked to the bones. Hawkeye strips off his buckskin hunting shirt and wrings it out.
text: Cora turns her back, strips off her white blouse and puts on the faster-drying chamois.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Are we safe?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Maybe ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Our father? Did you see my father?
scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSE UP: HAWKEYE
text: The look on his face tells it all
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Tell me!
speaker_heading: TWO SHOT
text: Hawkeye takes Cora away from the group and turns her by her shoulders and whispers
text: to her. We don't hear what he says. Cora drops to her knees and places her hands over
text: her eyes and face like a little girl trying to make something bad go away.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: Leads her to a depression, his arm around her shoulders, her face covered and she cries
text: softly into his shoulder.
scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSE UP: CORA
text: says into Hawkeye's ear, after she looks O.S. ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Say nothing to Alice ...!
text: Hawkeye nods.
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: stands in the chamber not far from the wall of water, fascinated with its shimmer. She's
text: oblivious to all the events and everything going on around her ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: sees Cora &amp; Hawkeye together and turns away.
speaker_heading: GROUP
text: Uncas watches Alice. The wounded Ranger has fallen asleep. The Redcoat is
text: exhausted. Hawkeye &amp; Cora against the wall.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR RIVER BANK - RIVER FALLS ARE IN MIST &amp; RED SKY -
speaker_heading: TWILIGHT
text: A landscape with mist rearlit by the red light of the sun that's already behind the
text: mountains. The blues are turning purple and the greens are turning black and the white
text: highlights of the foaming water are going rose. Reflecting the darkening sky, where the
text: surface isn't broken, the water is fast-moving metal ... SUDDENLY: a shaved head and
text: muscled back stands into the foreground. It moves down the shore away from camera.
text: He's followed by other Huron warriors. They're two hundred yards away from Glen
dialog: Falls island.
speaker_heading: HURON
text: looks at the island of rock &amp; trees and tilts his head curiously ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FOREST ABOVE CANYON &amp; FALLS - GREY WOLF - TWILIGHT
text: watches the Hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls.
scene_heading: OVER HIS SHOULDER: THREE MORE WOLVES
text: join him, moving frenetically, uneasily ... The leader of the pack looks up &amp; howls as
text: his eyes go white reflecting the new moon.
scene_heading: INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - HAWKEYE -NIGHT
text: hears the distant howl. He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling
text: water. Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out there. He exchanges worried glances
dialog: with Uncas &amp; Chingachgook.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: immediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and Chingachgook moves
text: carefully to the first fissure. Hawkeye follows.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: His countenance gives way momentarily. All his experience seems of no avail. He
text: touches the side of Cora's face. Grabs Killdeer and follows Chingachgook.
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: sensing new danger, slips away on her own.
speaker_heading: CORA
text: crosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting delirious. She can't do
text: a thing except hold his hand and think of her father.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE &amp; CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: below the edge, listen &amp; wait, testing the environment with all their senses ...
speaker_heading: NORTH FISSURE - UNCAS
text: against one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky ...
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: looks at the sky through the fissure. She sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight
text: pull her forward. She starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them.
dialog: Suddenly ...
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: yanks her down next to him. He pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the
text: edge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand. There is no sign she
dialog: was seen.
speaker_heading: UNCAS &amp; ALICE
text: He relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent.
text: Languorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up,
text: as if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy. Uncas tries to restrain her.
speaker_heading: ALICE'S
text: eyes slowly open. Oblivion disappears. It's replaced with escalating fear. She holds onto
text: Uncas with desperation. Her fingers claw his shoulders. She buries her face in his
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Uncas ...
text: Her body shudders. Her terror's total. He tries to restrain and calm her. She won't let
text: him. Then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life,
text: she holds him between her thighs. And Uncas is confused, but Alice whispers his name
text: and he responds. He loves her in the half-light.
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems to reach some
text: emotional climax and begins to cry softly, and Uncas stops making love to her and
text: holds her. Then she's flooded with shame. He reaches for her. She jerks away. He
text: reaches for her again and clutches her to him. And she breaks down. Then he turns her
text: face to him, but her expression has completely flattened.
speaker_heading: WIDER ANGLE
text: She's not a lover to Uncas now. She's pitiful &amp; stricken and he comforts her.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR RIVER - MAGUA - NIGHT
text: beaches a canoe on the bank. He and eight braves ease out. His war paint is fresh:
text: green handprints on his chest and black and green on his face. Black plumes are affixed
text: to his scalp-lock and his shawl is over his left shoulder. The right arm carrying his
text: musket is exposed. Many scalps are tied to his tomahawk. He walks towards us
text: approaching the island, two hundred yards away ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE - NIGHT
text: checks his powder horn. Nearly empty. He looks at Chingachgook.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR GLEN FALLS ISLAND, CAVE - CORA - NIGHT
text: with the Ranger, looks up. Hawkeye enters. The look on his face. Then hers. They've
text: been discovered. Now they're backed into a hole in the ground with no powder and no
dialog: way out.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - HAWKEYE &amp; CHINGACHGOOK - NIGHT
text: Chingachgook talks to him in Mohican. Momentarily the anger and frustration is seen
text: on Hawkeye's face. All his experience &amp; craft has been to no avail. He looks at Cora.
text: Back to Chingachgook. Chingachgook states something terse in Mohican. Hawkeye
text: agrees. Heyward's confused. He doesn't know what they're talking about. Cora has
dialog: understood Chingachgook's intent perfectly.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Yes. Go ahead.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: (explodes)
dialog: What the bloody hell plan is this?
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Cora)
dialog: In this there is a chance. If I live, I can
dialog: try to free you. If we don't go, there is
dialog: no powder, there's too many of them.
dialog: Though my heart would keep me here,
dialog: in that there is no chance. None. I can do
dialog: nothing. Do you understand?
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Yes. I want you to go.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Coward! Coward back at the fort.
dialog: Coward here.
text: Hawkeye uses discipline not to kill the man.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: You try. With all you have. To save
dialog: yourself. If the worst happens, and
dialog: only one of us survives, something of
dialog: the other does, too ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR NORTH FISSURE - UNCAS - NIGHT
text: Listens. Hears. Then he inches above cover to see ...
scene_heading: UNCAS' POV: THE RIVER &amp; SIX WAR CANOES
text: of Hurons approach to assault the island carrying torches.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - CORA &amp; HAWKEYE - NIGHT
text: She's holding him. In the rigid language of her body is the struggle to contain her fear.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (very close)
dialog: If they don't kill you, they may take you
dialog: north up into Canada. A warrior may take
dialog: you for a wife.
speaker_heading: CORA
text: turns aside. Hawkeye insists.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (continues)
dialog: Listen. Submit. You hear me? You're
dialog: strong. You stay alive. I will find you ...
dialog: no matter how far, how long it takes ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: (nods, low)
dialog: ... never doubt what you are doing.
speaker_heading: RANGER
text: conscious now, arranges his crushed body to face the direction from which will come
dialog: the attack as ...
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: puts Alice, who's entered, behind him as ... Uncas hits the floor of the cave. Now the
text: first glow from Huron torches starts to light the walls. They're coming ...
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: has their weapons slung over his back. He says something in Mohican. Uncas spins
text: looks at Alice: her expression's vacant.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE'S KNIFE
text: cuts a lock of Cora's hair. He folds it into his shirt. The orange light from Huron
text: torches, now closer, plays on the wall behind her. We hear many Huron approach.
scene_heading: CHINGACHGOOK &amp; UNCAS
text: now run out of the cave and throw themselves into the curtain of water. This is their
dialog: exit.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: engraves her image in his memory one last time and then sprints across the floor
dialog: towards the water ...
text: WHAT HAWKEYE SEES: JAMMING AT THE WATERFALL
dialog: and then through it into ...
scene_heading: SUBJECTIVE CAMERA: UP
text: An awful crushing roar. We explode out the front of a white cataract a third of the way
text: from the top and we fall down away from the world.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR GLEN FALLS - HAWKEYE - NIGHT
text: tumbles down the falls; rolling, tumbling through the white water; then through air;
text: then back into cascading white water again, disappearing ...
scene_heading: THE RIVER BELOW - UNCAS &amp; CHINGACHGOOK'S
text: bodies hit, disappear and don't surface. It looks unsurviveable.
scene_heading: HAWKEYE'S POV: FALLING
text: Sheets of water fall with us. The bottom races towards us at a hundred miles an hour ...
dialog: Just before we hit ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - FLAMING TORCH - NIGHT
text: WIDEN. The cave is filled with Hurons. The Redcoat is dead in the corner. A group of
text: braves moves away from the body of the Ranger.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD'S
text: surrounded. The women are behind him. He slashes at one Huron with his sword and is
text: clubbed down by a giant.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: enters. His blanket, like a shawl, over his left shoulder, black plumes in his hair. He's
dialog: imperturbable.
speaker_heading: MAGUA'S HAND
text: reaches out and touches Cora's hair. Cora is frozen to the spot. His hand drops away
text: from the hated Munros and as Magua turns to go, he says something low in Huron and
text: the two women are jerked towards the fissures. Heyward is dragged by the arms.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR RIVER - WHITE WATER - NIGHT
text: miles from the falls. We see a figure. It's Chingachgook, nearly spent, rolling and
text: tumbling through the fast-moving white water. He submerges, then surfaces again. He
text: appears exhausted by the fall and ride.
scene_heading: CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: WATER
text: rocketing at us, battering and drowning us. We glimpse something downstream ...
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: tries to focus, slammed against rocks, he's striking out towards the right, swimming
text: against the current. He's grabbing for something.
speaker_heading: KILLDEER'S MUZZLE
text: and leather shoulder-strap. Chingachgook's hand grabs it. The current rushing past tries
text: to steal him from Uncas and Hawkeye, who're also beaten, bloodied, exhausted. They
text: pull the older, larger man from the water and ...
speaker_heading: ON THE ROCK
text: all three lie there, almost devoid of energy. Then Hawkeye rises, looks at the others.
text: Chingachgook nods. He's up. Then Uncas, and they're moving off into the calm eddy
text: between the rock they landed on and the shoreline.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FOREST - HURONS - DAY
dialog: move along animal paths.
speaker_heading: CORA &amp; ALICE
text: struggle through the branches of trees. No one helps them. When they fall behind, they
text: are pushed forward.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: badly beaten, bound, staggers ahead to get behind Maqua. Then:
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers
dialog: ... will receive many gifts.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: (as if considering)
dialog: Gifts?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: Three, four oxen ... much wampum.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: Wampum?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: Does Yengeese Major have property
dialog: across salt sea?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.
dialog: Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum,
dialog: many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
text: Magua looks at Heyward derisively. Does this white man think he's an idiot?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Gold could be arranged.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: For Munro children?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: How much gold has the master of the
dialog: Yengeese?
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: The King? The King has mountains of
dialog: gold!
text: Long pause as if Magua and King George II were seriously considering this 	transaction.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: Not enough.
text: Heyward is first realizing with whom he's playing.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
dialog: What is enough?
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: Heart. Give Magua new heart.
text: Magua totally disdains the Englishman and walks away from him, starting up a steeper
text: forested hill.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE, UNCAS &amp; CHINGACHGOOK - TWILIGHT
text: running cross-country after the Huron column. They leap over fallen logs and keep
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: FRONTAL: HAWKEYE
text: breathing hard, his lips are drawn back, sweat stains his buckskins.
speaker_heading: PROFILE: UNCAS
text: runs. Then sees something.
speaker_heading: BENT BRANCH
text: where Cora &amp; Alice were struggling up the animal path.
speaker_heading: REAR SHOT
text: as they race across a stream away from us after the war party and into the night ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FOREST - CORA - NIGHT
text: supporting Alice, is dragged forward by a Huron warrior by a woven rawhide thong
text: tied to her neck.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: is imperturbable.
speaker_heading: HURONS
text: move quickly down into a ravine.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: is shoved forward.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR FOREST - RUNNING FEET - DAY
text: Long, loping strides.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE &amp; UNCAS
text: cover ground like long-distance runners. No noise except their hard, even breathing.
text: They're moving down a clear trail.
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: out on the flank. Running hard.
speaker_heading: CLOSER: HAWKEYE
text: lips are drawn back, determined, flashing through the hard verticals of the forest, now
text: leaps down an embankment into the soft loam and keeps going.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXT. HURON VILLAGE - ORNATE CHAIR - DAY
text: on a rude platform. The entire village is crowded in a large circle. They all wait for
text: someone. They've been waiting a long time. In the perimeter warriors keep Huron at
text: bay for some reason. We see Magua. He stands apart. They wait. Then ...
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SACHEM
text: is led to the dais by three women down the main street between the neat rows of birch
text: bark lodges. Many scalps and trophies from the massacre are in evidence. He sits on the
text: raised platform. He looks to be in his nineties. His dark wrinkled face is contrasted by
text: his long white hair. His robe is painted in hieroglyphical representation of combat. He
text: wears numerous silver &amp; gold medals, gifts of French, English and Dutch governors.
text: Most startling is his face. His dark &amp; lined skin is enhanced by delicate lines of
text: tatooing. He looks up to Magua.
speaker_heading: SACHEM
dialog: (in Huron; subtitled)
dialog: The tomahawks of your young men have
dialog: been very red.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: (in Huron; subtitled)
dialog: Many of the Yengeese are dead, great
dialog: Sachem.
dialog: (sound dissolve to English)
dialog: I have brought three of my prisoners,
dialog: to honor you. Two are the children
dialog: of Munro. Whose scalp hangs on my
dialog: lodge pole. And whose heart I cut from
text: his chest.
text: Now we see Cora on the ground. Defeat &amp; fear are held in place by her determination.
text: Alice looks around, in another place. Heyward's hands are bound between his back with
text: a piece of wood wedged through his elbows.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR DIFFERENT FOREST - WIDE FRONTAL: UNCAS, HAWKEYE &amp;
scene_heading: CHINGACHGOOK - DAY
text: running. Then Uncas drops and the other two follow.
scene_heading: WIDE OVER THEIR SHOULDERS: THE HURON "CASTLE"
text: seen in the distance through the sparse trees. They have dropped at the very periphery
dialog: of the forest where the woods end. (The lay of the land is important for action that
text: follows: the village is built in a meadow. To the left is a cliff face that rises to a rocky
text: promontory. On the right is a path that winds up to the promontory and beyond, across
dialog: the mountains.)
dialog: Hawkeye sees ...
scene_heading: HAWKEYE'S POV: THE VILLAGE, CAPTIVES &amp; HURON CROWD
text: in the center, outside the largest lodge.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: slams the earth with his fists. They didn't intercept them in time. Difficult odds just
dialog: became impossible.
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR HURON VILLAGE - MAGUA - DAY
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: ... the earth was pale. Our tomahawks
dialog: were bright. Now they are dull from war.
dialog: And the Huron rich with the trophies of
dialog: honor ... Magua will sell the English
dialog: officer to Les Francais and the reward is
dialog: my gift to you, wise one ... The women -
dialog: children of the white war chief - will burn
dialog: in our fires so all can share in this.
text: The sachem considers this. Then he looks up and sees something beyond Magua.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: senses the sachem's eye line ...
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: unarmed, walking through the Hurons. A young boy rushes at him. Hawkeye, at the
text: last possible second, dodges. Others catch and restrain the boy. The Hurons are
text: astounded a European would simply walk into their camp.
speaker_heading: CORA
text: sees him enter, doesn't believe he's there.
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Nathaniel!
text: Hawkeye glances at her, doesn't respond. The situation is a stick of dynamite ready to
dialog: go off.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Heyward; low)
dialog: Translate for me, Major. Into French.
dialog: Every word ... as I say it.
text: Magua starts towards Hawkeye, his tomahawk slipping into his hand.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Sachem)
dialog: I come to you unarmed and in peace to
dialog: unstop your ears, wise one. Because the
dialog: Hurons are mislead by the words of the
dialog: wolf who's never spoken the truth.
text: Sachem gestures with his hand to Magua. Magua reluctantly stops advancing on
text: Hawkeye. Heyward's French translation has faded to a murmur. We hear Hawkeye's
dialog: English.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro
dialog: go free and take the fire out of the English
text: anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: (to Sachem)
dialog: Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the
dialog: Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron
dialog: do not fear English anger.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: (to Sachem)
dialog: Wise one, the French fathers made peace
dialog: and swore to their honor not to break the
dialog: friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that
dialog: the French would not be friends, still, to
dialog: the Huron.
text: Sachem reacts.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: It made our French father happy to never
dialog: have to fight the same Yengeese again.
dialog: He told me this without telling me this.
text: Hawkeye realizes this is true.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: So the Huron are the servants of the French?
dialog: To do what the French are shamed to do?
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: No.
dialog: (to Sachem)
dialog: Huron serve no one. The French father
dialog: believes he fooled Magua because he is so
text: proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it
text: is the Huron path that Magua walks down,
dialog: not the French one ... Now, Les Francais,
dialog: also, fear Huron. That is good. When the
dialog: Huron is strong from their fear, we will make
dialog: the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we
dialog: will trade as the white man trades. Take land
dialog: from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk
dialog: &amp; Fox. And make the Huron great. Over

speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: (to Sachem)
text: The red man put down the bow, picked up

dialog: in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers
dialog: foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell
dialog: them for gold to the white man? Would the
dialog: Huron have greed for more land than a man
dialog: can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?
dialog: Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would
dialog: the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the
dialog: animals in the forest for beads &amp; brandy? But
dialog: sell the fur to the white man for gold? ...
dialog: (to Sachem)
dialog: Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les
dialog: Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron
dialog: men who hunt &amp; work the land? Or of dogs?
dialog: ... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make
dialog: himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become
dialog: Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?
dialog: ... Magua's way is false. It is like the white
dialog: sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness
dialog: and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye,
dialog: adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican
dialog: people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go
dialog: free ... I speak the truth.
text: Magua starts to rebut. Sachem holds up his hand and stops him. Nobody talks. Sachem

speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: waits for the decision.
speaker_heading: CORA
text: looks to Alice, then to Hawkeye.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: exchanges a desperate look with Cora and then senses the Sachem is staring at him
dialog: from the perspective of nearly a century of laws &amp; judgments. Then ... to every word.
speaker_heading: SACHEM

dialog: passed. And night enters our future with

dialog: (pause)
dialog: Our council talks since I was a boy:
dialog: What is the Huron to do?

dialog: But Magua would lead Huron down paths
dialog: that make us not Hurons.

speaker_heading: SACHEM

speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
dialog: No! listen.

text: Cora is jerked forward by three Hurons. Magua grabs Alice. Cora strikes at Magua. He
text: knocks her aside. Chaos &amp; confusion. Meanwhile:
speaker_heading: MAGUA
dialog: (French; subtitled)
dialog: This is not the voice of wisdom. I go to
dialog: the Hurons of the Lakes! You are women.
dialog: Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca,
dialog: beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind.
dialog: Slaves, dogs, rabbits, thieves ... I spit on you!
text: Those Hurons who hear, do so in deadly, boding silence. Magua and his fourteen hard
dialog: core braves start out as ...
speaker_heading: SACHEM
text: heard Heyward's translation. He looks at Heyward, then looks at Hawkeye and he nods
dialog: his head.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE
text: sees this. His eyes go to Cora. They've stopped dragging her towards the fire pit.
text: Hawkeye steps forward to surrender. Cora is thrown at him. Cora looks around wildly.
text: Instead of taking Hawkeye, two warriors grab Heyward.
speaker_heading: HEYWARD
text: is immediately hamstrung and his legs collapse. He gasps. He's caught under the arms
text: and dragged forward.
speaker_heading: HAWKEYE

dialog: And my compliments to you ...
speaker_heading: CORA
dialog: Alice?
text: Hawkeye's concentration is on backing out of the Huron mob. Will the Sachem's

scene_heading: HAWKEYE'S POV: HURONS

speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK

text: Uncas' hand jams into a crack in the granite, forms a fist and twists, making a wedge.
text: He swings out, dangling in space by the hand wedged into the rock. His right hand
text: reaches out and up, searching the vertical face for ...
speaker_heading: UNCAS' HAND
text: ... a rock flake. An indentation. Anything ... His fingers find a diagonal crevice and ...
speaker_heading: UNCAS
text: swings out, now hanging by the vertical face above the overhang. His features are
text: distorted with determination. Nothing will stop him. His right hand grabs another rock.
text: His arms snap him up. Then push. He's on the ledge. Moving fast ...
dialog: CUT TO ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - HURONS - DAY

speaker_heading: WIDE ANGLE
text: Two's musket coming up. Uncas swings. FIRES. Before he's fallen, Uncas bayonets
dialog: Three.
speaker_heading: FOURTH
text: FIRES, misses, swings. Uncas slips the swung musket, but it catches his elbow. Uncas'
text: musket falls. Before it hits the ground his tomahawk is out and hacks Four over the
dialog: edge ...
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: running forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on. It's incredibly fast.
speaker_heading: UNCAS'
text: three tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks like silver
text: flashes. Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right and slams Magua with an open
text: hand, closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle ... and Magua throws Uncas.
text: Going with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into his armpit. Uncas'
text: right arm is useless. He scrambles up. Next to the expertise of a mature warrior like
text: Magua, Uncas' raw, young determination may not be enough.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR - MEADOW - CHINGACHGOOK
dialog: freezes.
scene_heading: EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS

text: pools of deep water, calm, open, almost beatific. It stops Magua ...
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: inexplicably, drops his knife hand. He's riveted by her. About him, there's a glimmer of
text: something else. He wears a human face for this one moment. He reaches out with his
dialog: other hand to offer her safety. To bring her back from the edge ...
speaker_heading: ALICE
text: looks down at Uncas, her lover, dead on the rocks below. She turns to Magua with
text: enigmatic calm. Her eyes seem to see into him. She steps off the edge. She falls to her

dialog: on the run ...
scene_heading: EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - MAGUA

speaker_heading: TO CHINGACHGOOK

text: The massive war club crashes into Magua's back.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: stunned, turns to hatchet Chingachgook ...
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: now up and towering - slams his club right into Magua's assault ... destroying it,
dialog: breaking Magua's right arm. And ...
speaker_heading: CHINGACHGOOK
text: ... with his momentum, spins like a shot-putter and the next blow cripples Magua's left
text: side and crushes part of his chest.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER BLOW
text: destroys Magua's collar and shoulder.
speaker_heading: MAGUA
text: amazed. His body is broken and crippled, but he still stands. He looks into the eyes of

dialog: Then our race will be no more, or be not us ...
