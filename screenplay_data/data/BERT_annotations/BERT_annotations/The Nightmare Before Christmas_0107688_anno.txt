dialog: Jack's Lament
dialog: Performed by Danny Elfman
dialog: There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
dialog: For my talents are renowned far and wide
text: When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
dialog: I excel without ever even trying
dialog: With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
dialog: I have seen grown men give out a shriek
text: With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
dialog: I have swept the very bravest off their feet
dialog: Yet year after year, it's the same routine
dialog: And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
dialog: And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
dialog: Have grown so tired of the same old thing
dialog: Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
text: An emptiness began to grow
dialog: There's something out there, far from my home
dialog: A longing that I've never known
dialog: I'm the master of fright, and a demon of light
dialog: And I'll scare you right out of your pants
dialog: To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
dialog: And I'm known throughout England and France
dialog: And since I am dead, I can take off my head
dialog: To recite Shakespearean quotations
dialog: No animal nor man can scream like I can
dialog: With the fury of my recitations
dialog: But who here would ever understand
dialog: That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
dialog: Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
dialog: He'd give it all up if he only could
dialog: Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
dialog: That calls out for something unknown
dialog: The fame and praise come year after year
dialog: Does nothing for these empty tears
dialog: [leaving graveyard and entering forest]

dialog: It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen
dialog: And as hard as I try
dialog: I can't seem to describe
dialog: Like a most improbable dream
dialog: But you must believe when I tell you this
dialog: It's as real as my skull and it does exist

dialog: Let's try it at once
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Everyone, please now, not so fast
dialog: There's something here that you don't quite grasp
dialog: Well, I may as well give them what they want
dialog: And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
dialog: For the ruler of this Christmas land
text: Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
dialog: Least that's what I've come to understand
dialog: And I've also heard it told
dialog: That he's something to behold
text: Like a lobster, huge and red
text: When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
text: Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
dialog: That is, so I've heard it said
dialog: And on a dark, cold night
text: Under full moonlight
text: He flies into a fog
text: Like a vulture in the sky
dialog: And they call him Sandy Claws
dialog: Well, at least they're excited
dialog: But they don't understand
dialog: That special kind of feeling in Christmas land
dialog: Oh, well...

dialog: When I think I've got it, and then at last
text: Through my bony fingers it does slip
text: Like a snowflake in a fiery grip
dialog: Something here I'm not quite getting
dialog: Though I try, I keep forgetting
dialog: Like a memory long since past
text: Here in an instant, gone in a flash
dialog: What does it mean?
dialog: What does it mean?
dialog: In these little bric-a-brac
text: A secret's waiting to be cracked
dialog: These dolls and toys confuse me so

dialog: What does it mean?
dialog: What does it mean?
dialog: What does it mean?
dialog: Hmm...
dialog: I've read these Christmas books so many times
dialog: I know the stories and I know the rhymes
dialog: I know the Christmas carols all by heart
text: My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
dialog: As often as I've read them, something's wrong
dialog: So hard to put my bony finger on
dialog: Or perhaps it's really not as deep
dialog: As I've been led to think
dialog: Am I trying much too hard?
dialog: Of course! I've been too close to see
text: The answer's right in front of me
dialog: Right in front of me
dialog: It's simple really, very clear
text: Like music drifting in the air
text: Invisible, but everywhere
dialog: Just because I cannot see it
dialog: Doesn't mean I can't believe it
dialog: 
dialog: You know, I think this Christmas thing
dialog: It's not as tricky as it seems
dialog: And why should they have all the fun?
dialog: It should belong to anyone
dialog: Not anyone, in fact, but me
dialog: Why, I could make a Christmas tree
dialog: And there's no reason I can find
dialog: I couldn't handle Christmas time
dialog: I bet I could improve it too
dialog: And that's exactly what I'll do
