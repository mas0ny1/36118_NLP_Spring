text: From across Broadway we see a little girl waiting at the
text: curb. She steps off the curb toward us --
text: A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened
text: perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But
text: the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to
text: and fro through the frame.

scene_heading: 4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. 4
text: An 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School,
dialog: one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive

text: The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers.
speaker_heading: MR AARON
dialog: Abrams... Allende...
text: One after the other the students get up to collect their

text: On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her

text: At "Cohen" LISA gets up and heads for the desk.
text: LISA'S POV, closing in slowly on MR AARON who glances up at

speaker_heading: LISA
speaker_heading: (SITTING)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: MR AARON
dialog: Now...I know you had a little help...
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's
dialog: what you mean.
speaker_heading: MR AARON
dialog: I'm just saying I know you had a little
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: A lot of people did.
speaker_heading: MR AARON
dialog: Be that as it may --
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I mean I'll take it over again if you want,
dialog: but like, what would be the point?
dialog: It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need
dialog: to know this stuff in my daily life...
speaker_heading: MR AARON
dialog: Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily
dialog: true. Haven't you ever developed an
dialog: interest in something you didn't initially
dialog: think you were going to develop an interest
dialog: in?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Um, no, not really.

speaker_heading: LISA (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big
dialog: difference-between using a book and like, I
dialog: don't know, using somebody else's mind
dialog: who's like, really good at math? It's not
dialog: like this person did the whole test for me.
speaker_heading: MR AARON
dialog: Oh no?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: No. I did some of it.
text: She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.
speaker_heading: MR AARON

scene_heading: 8 INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 8

text: "STRIKERS" "PINKERTONS" and "PREZ. McKINLEY."
speaker_heading: KLEIN
dialog: .So the President of the United States,
dialog: William B. McKinley, authorized the use of

dialog: they went out there and shot them down!
dialog: Just like they did in Virginia, just like

dialog: What do you think? Did we ever have a good
dialog: President?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Um...I don't know. I guess most of them
dialog: have just been totally corrupt.
speaker_heading: - LEWIS
dialog: Lisa?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a
dialog: big fan of all the Presidents of the United
dialog: States, especially the current one, but I
dialog: still don't think its necessarily all that
dialog: useful to categorize every President as
dialog: universally corrupt, because that just
dialog: seems very general to me. Especially if
dialog: you're going to judge them by the standard
dialog: of -- whatever they're supposed to

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.
speaker_heading: DARREN
dialog: Why would you want to buy a cowboy hat?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Because my Dad is supposed to take me and
dialog: my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to
dialog: go horseback riding, and I don't think it
dialog: would be right to appear on horseback in
dialog: New Mexico without the appropriate
dialog: equestrian paraphernalia, Darren. You

dialog: never thought this through for myself!
dialog: Which I have! Many times!
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous
dialog: assumption on my part. I don't actually
dialog: like the opera that much myself. But I'm

dialog: wrong! (Pause) I'm sorry. I guess I'm a

speaker_heading: LISA

dialog: What Curtis and I think.
speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: JOAN

speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Pretentious?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: I don't mean they didn't really enjoy

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: As you all know, Monica was not a religious
dialog: woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through
dialog: a wedding or a funeral with her knows how
dialog: she felt about formal occasions. So Harry
dialog: and Elise and I, when we were talking about
dialog: this, decided we would just have everyone
dialog: over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk.
dialog: about Monica just talk about her. Maybe
dialog: share some remembrances of her. Some of us
dialog: know each other, some of us don't. But
dialog: we're all here because we loved Monica.

dialog: because we want to pay tribute to her in a
text: way that might conceivably not enrage her.
text: Everyone laughs slightly.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want to tell anyone what to think,
dialog: or how to feel. And I don't want to kid
dialog: myself about the stupid, meaningless way
dialog: she died, because it would really make her
dialog: throw up. But I don't want it to become the
dialog: summation of her life. Because it's not.
dialog: When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can
dialog: you stand it?" And she said. "First of all
dialog: I can't. But I don't want to take away the
dialog: twelve years she did have, and turn them
dialog: all into leukemia. Because they weren't."
dialog: So despite the fact that she got -- ripped
dialog: off, I do think it's important to remember
dialog: that Monica got a lot out of life. She was
dialog: the most fully developed person I
dialog: personally have ever known. She was also
dialog: impossible to get along with, but that's
dialog: another story.
text: Everybody laughs.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOHN

dialog: at...I think what he's getting at here is a
dialog: very dark view of the arbitrary nature of

speaker_heading: DAVID
text: But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher
dialog: purpose that we can't see. He's saying that
dialog: what seems like them killing us for sport
dialog: could just be because our consciousness

dialog: OK, but -- I still don't think that's what

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, like if you say they kill us for their
dialog: sport, when our perception of the gods is
dialog: so meager that we can't even tell what
dialog: they're doing, then how can we be so

dialog: to kill us for their sport?
speaker_heading: JOHN

dialog: I don't know ...Um -- Monica?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: I don't think that's what he's saying at

speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys.
dialog: Anybody? Anybody?
speaker_heading: MONICA
dialog: Yeah...1
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But if the gods' consciousness is so much
dialog: more developed than ours that we seem like

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: David, I think you've made your point.
dialog: But it's not what Shakespeare meant.
dialog: Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Scholarly opinion...:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: And in this particular play what I think

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think he is saying that, because he's
dialog: comparing human consciousness to flies, and
dialog: he's saying that we can't see the truth
dialog: around us because our consciousness is
text: undeveloped.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No David, that's not what Shakespeare
dialog: meant! He says it somewhere else in the
dialog: play, but I don't want to get hung up on

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: She didn't have any relatives, except for

speaker_heading: DAVE
speaker_heading: (ON "EXCEPT")
dialog: -- or -- hang on a minute -- unless you're

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I am the executor of her estate.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: -- which is Emily. I know.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So good.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yes. This is good. Because the executor of
dialog: the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit,
dialog: but the beneficiary has to be a relative.
dialog: So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful
dialog: Death suit you can sue for Pain and
dialog: Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of
dialog: Support or Services.. .And also what's
dialog: called Care, Comfort and Society: --like
dialog: advice, counseling of the parent that the

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You can really sue for that?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Yeah, and that's probably what we would do,
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing?
dialog: The bus driver?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't
dialog: have any money. You basically sue everybody
dialog: and hope something sticks. The person who
dialog: pays will be the MTA's insurance company.

speaker_heading: DAVE EMILY
dialog: It depends: How badly do you think we
dialog: could ever hurt them?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: -- if she was alive, in great pain for an
dialog: extended period of time, they give more

speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: And I gather in a lot .of pain?
speaker_heading: LISA

speaker_heading: DAVE

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I'm sorry, Emily. (To DAVE) Yeah, awake.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: That's OK.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that
dialog: long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a

dialog: after all's said and done, it's not a very
dialog: good case.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Because it's your word against his, and

speaker_heading: LISA

dialog: It's not like I'm trying to get any money

speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That's true-Since she have no financial

speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Impeached for what?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: She can't have her credibility attacked on

speaker_heading: EMILY

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What about --

dialog: -- Emily? What do you think?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I think it sounds like we should do it.
dialog: But I'd like to discuss some of the --
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
speaker_heading: (ON "BUT")
dialog: Hey, if that's the vote...
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Unless you think there's something to be

speaker_heading: DEUTSCH
dialog: I think it would be a big mistake.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL

speaker_heading: DEUTSCH
dialog: OK. Now the only down side to this as it
dialog: stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and
dialog: Lisa to be here is because I know this may
dialog: be a serious wrinkle for you all -- is that
dialog: 
dialog: the bus company will absolutely not discuss
dialog: the removal of the driver.
speaker_heading: LISA &amp; EMILY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: The driver?
speaker_heading: LISA EMILY
dialog: Then forget it. Tell them to What do you mean they
dialog: forget it. won't discuss the removal
dialog: of the driver?

speaker_heading: DEUTSCH
dialog: Please. Ladies. Let me ROB
dialog: finish what I'm saying. Whoa -- hello!
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
text: It's just a blast in our ears.
speaker_heading: EMILY
speaker_heading: (TO LISA)
dialog: Let him finish.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Finish what? Forget it!
speaker_heading: DEUTSCH
speaker_heading: (TO EMILY)
dialog: Thank you. I want you to understand, Lisa,
dialog: I pressed them very very hard on this, but
dialog: they will not discuss disciplining of a
dialog: company employee as part of the settlement
dialog: because it could be seen as an admission of
dialog: guilt on the part of the MTA --
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What does giving us three hundred thousand
dialog: dollars mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEUTSCH
dialog: Settling out of court does not imply an
dialog: admission of guilt. It simply does not
dialog: carry the same stigma. On top of that you
dialog: may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a
dialog: very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right

speaker_heading: DEUTSCH

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: It's the only reason we're here.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Can I jump in here? Russel?
speaker_heading: DEUTSCH
speaker_heading: (TO LISA)
dialog: .but it's really not your decision.
speaker_heading: ROB ABIGAIL
dialog: Hello? Are you still with us? Please!
speaker_heading: LISA
text: It's Emily's decision.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DEUTSCH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: It's not?
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: They're not listening, Robbie.
speaker_heading: DEUTSCH
dialog: It's Abigail's decision because she's the
dialog: next of kin.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: But she didn't even know about it!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: That doesn't matter.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Could we get back in this conversation
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: DEUTSCH
dialog: Yes. I'm sorry. Obviously there's some very
dialog: strong emotions going either way on this --

speaker_heading: 167 CONTINUED: (5) 167
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Listen, Emily? I don't know what you're
dialog: thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we
dialog: should take Russel's recommendation while
dialog: we can. Because if they won't fire the
dialog: guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six
dialog: months or a year from now we're gonna --
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: we're gonna be in a situation where
dialog: we're beggin' them for half this much,
dialog: which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as
dialog: now, and they're still not gonna fire this
dialog: guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and
dialog: the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do
dialog: you see what I mean?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: The entire point of the lawsuit was to get
dialog: the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody
dialog: else -- !
speaker_heading: DEUTSCH
dialog: Lemme just clarify --
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: -- it was not to get you three hundred and
dialog: fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you
dialog: were entitled to, for somebody you didn't
dialog: even like... !
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: This is a distortion --
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: And the only reason you're getting the
dialog: money at all is because I started this
dialog: whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry
dialog: for swearing, but you should be willing to
dialog: trade in all the money for getting this guy
dialog: off the street --
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: For getting him, Abigail!
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Well I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility
dialog: to Monica and I take that responsibility
dialog: very seriously. You are talking about an
dialog: offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we
dialog: don't do something about it right now.

speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (CONT'D)
dialog: And rather than being abused over the
dialog: telephone and cursed at for having the
dialog: courtesy to involve you in these
dialog: discussions, Lisa, I would hope you would
dialog: be guided by our judgement. Unless I'm
dialog: wrong about that.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: None of that matters --
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Unless I'm wrong about that. Just what is
dialog: your interest in this?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Because I'm the one who killed her! I'm
dialog: the one who killed her! But at least I
dialog: know I did it, and that guy has no idea!
dialog: And he's wandering around blaming everybody
dialog: else and all I want is for somebody to let
dialog: him know that what he did was wrong! And
dialog: if they don't fire him and all you want is
dialog: the money and the police won't do anything,
dialog: how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't
dialog: take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you
dialog: could get any money, it was because we
dialog: wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter
dialog: about the money! You wouldn't have gotten
dialog: it before!
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Well it may not matter to you, but where I
dialog: come from three hundred and fifty thousand
dialog: dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my
dialog: mind is a positive result of all this
dialog: tragedy and not just negative. Not just
dialog: getting someone fired for one mistake, no
dialog: matter how bad it was --

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: No...No...Never mind ...I'm sure he's sorry

speaker_heading: MR AARON
dialog: I don't see what difference that makes, if
dialog: he's sorry. And I think whoever it is
dialog: should know about this.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this

speaker_heading: BONNIE
dialog: We're not gonna tell anyone. But you're
