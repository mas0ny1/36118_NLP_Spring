scene_heading: EXT. WORK FARM - NIGHTFALL
text: All we SEE is an ELEVATED SHOT of the distant mountains,
text: rolling landscape and McMURPHY -- one cheek laid-open and
text: crusted over with dried blood, his face and prison work
text: clothes caked with dried sweat and dust -- as he sits on the
text: very top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight.
text: A long moment passes before McMurphy's attention is drawn
text: elsewhere and he looks down.
scene_heading: REVERSE SHOT - McMURPHY'S POV
text: Far below, in the prison yard a MAN is SEEN hurrying acrcss
text: the yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed
text: prison guards, officials, and medics -- a stretcher, an
text: ambulance, a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the
text: base of the water tower. The man is seen talking to the
text: officials, then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look
text: up at McMurphy.
speaker_heading: McMURPHY
text: As he looks down at them, a searchlight is turned on him.
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
dialog: (through bullhorn)
dialog: McMurphy! This is Doctor Shankle,
dialog: from the infirmary. Can you hear
dialog: me?
text: McMurphy doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: SHANKLE (V.O.)
dialog: (through bullhorn)
dialog: Can you hear me, McMurphy?
text: McMurphy doesn't respond. Another searchlight goes on as a
text: SECOND VOICE is PICKED UP on the BULLHORN.
speaker_heading: SECOND VOICE
dialog: (through bullhorn)
dialog: Why don't we blast 'im, for Christ
dialog: sake, he ain't gonna come down...
dialog: you...
text: The BULLHORN is TURNED OFF. A long moment passes as McMurphy
text: continues to squat on the tower and wait. He shivers against
dialog: the coming night when...
speaker_heading: SHANKLE (V.O.)
dialog: (through bullhorn)
dialog: McMurphy!
dialog: I have the warden's promise. If you
dialog: come down, nobody will hurt you!
dialog: You'll be in my custody! I promise!
text: An imperceptible smile appears on McMurphy's face.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S DORM - OREGON STATE HOSPITAL - DAWN
text: Strange HUMMING SOUNDS, CLANKING PIPES and HISSING RADIATORS
text: as we see beds, with patients lying asleep, line two walls.
text: The third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill, with a door that
text: opens on to the day room. The door is open. On the far side
text: of the day room, a long hallway with other doors opening into
text: rooms: the latrine, washroom, tub room, mess hall, seclusion
text: room, psychiatrist's office, visitors' room, etc.
text: Across the day room, a glass enclosed nurses' station where
text: TURKLE, a Negro night attendant, is seen preparing to go off
dialog: duty.
text: The CAMERA PANS the beds in the men's dorm. One man turns,
text: another twists, a third lies as if dead.
text: CAMERA PAN ENDS on BROMDEN, who lies still, eyes wide open,
text: very alert. He reaches down, plucks a stale piece of gum from
text: under the bed frame, puts it in his mouth and starts chewing.
text: A beat, then Bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which
text: binds him to the bed. He slips out of bed and quietly makes
text: his way down the aisle, paying no attention to the other
text: patients, some of who are beginning to stir awake.
text: Ahead, at the end of the hallway, the door opens and three
text: Negro day attendants, WASHINGTON, WARREN and MILLER, dressed
text: in white uniforms, enter and move down the hallway and
text: disappear into a side room.
text: Bromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as
text: Turkle emerges from the side door to the nurses' lounge, goes
text: up the hallway as MISS PILBOW, the day nurse, comes in,
text: passing Turkle on the way out. She crosses to the nurses'
text: station and enters as Bromden reaches the day room.
scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
text: as Bromden makes his way across the day room, past the
text: nurses' station, unnoticed by Miss Pilbow who is busy
text: preparing the day's medication.
text: Bromden is sliding along the hallway wall, when he is
text: suddenly cut off by a mop which THUDS against one side of his
text: neck. A second mop yokes him on the other side. Bromden
text: freezes. Terrified.
speaker_heading: MILLER
dialog: Where you goin', Chief?
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: You goin' t'see the Big White
dialog: Fathuh?
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: He goin' t'see the Big White
dialog: Muthuh...
text: They cackle, legs jiving, as the ammonia stings Bromden's
text: eyes and burns his nose. He tries to twist his head, but
text: Washington jams the mop harder. Bromden freezes, panic
text: spreading across his face.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Haw, look at 'im, big 'nough to eat
dialog: apples off my head an' he mine me
dialog: like a baby...
text: A KEY is HEARD hitting the lock in the main door. Washington
text: very adroitly releases Bromden, hands him the mop, and turns,
text: along with Warren and Miller, to their duties, as BIG NURSE
text: enters the ward.
speaker_heading: THREE ATTENDANTS
dialog: (simultaneously, as Big
dialog: Nurse passes)
dialog: Mornin', Miss Ratched...
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Good morning, boys.
text: She sweeps by and disappears into the nurses' station. The
text: three attendants put their mops and rags aside and start
text: towards the men's dorm, leaving Bromden pressed against the
text: wall, mop in hand.
scene_heading: INT. NURSES' STATION
text: as Big Nurse enters to be greeted by Miss Pilbow, who wears

speaker_heading: MISS PILBOW

speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Mean old Monday, Miss Pilbow, mean

dialog: Everybody up, up, up!
text: The Chronics are physically helped out of bed as the Acutes,
text: who can handle themselves, cross out into the Day Room,
text: rubbing the sleep out of their eyes. Big Nurse steps out of
text: the Nurses' Station. Washington and Warren are hustling the
text: patients toward the washroom.
text: Miller stays behind, stripping Blastic's bed and rolling up

scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

text: Bromden comes drifting by, going in the opposite direction.
text: Big Nurse takes his hand and reaches up and pats his face.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Mister Bromden...
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Mister Washington!
text: Washington comes running.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: Yes, Miss Ratched?
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Mister Washington, why don't we get
dialog: a good head start on the day by
dialog: shaving Mister Bromden and see if

speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: (taking Bromden by the
dialog: hand)
dialog: Yes, Miss Ratched...
scene_heading: INT. WASHROOM - DAY
text: The patients are busy washing and shaving.
text: Warren is assisting a vegetable wash himself as Washington
text: guides Bromden through a cage-like partition... where an
text: antique barber chair stands.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: (calling as he goes)
dialog: Warren!
text: He sits Bromden down and straps his bands and legs in, then
text: plugs the electric shaver in and turns it on and brings the
text: BUZZING instrument towards Bromden's face. Bromden turns
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON (CONT'D)
dialog: (shouting out)
dialog: Get your black ass in here!
text: Warren props the vegetable up against the sink.
speaker_heading: WARREN
dialog: Tha's it... be right back!
text: Warren leaves; the old man starts sliding.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BROMDEN
text: as Warren enters and takes a firm grip on Bromden's head and
text: Washington goes to work on Bromden's face. CAMERA PUSHES INTO
text: EXTREME CLOSEUP of Bromden's fearfully distorted face as the
text: BUZZING SOUND of the electric razor INTENSIFIES until it is
scene_heading: INSUPPORTABLE.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
text: No sound as we SEE Big Nurse watch the last few patients file
text: past the side door to the Nurses' Station where Miss Pilbow
text: hands out little cups with pills. Washington stands by,
text: checking to see each man takes his pills before filling their
text: cups with orange juice.
text: The last patient takes his pills and returns to his place in
text: the Day Room. Miss Pilbow closes the window.
text: Satisfied that all is well, Big Nurse turns on an old 45
text: record player with a stack of records, then she settles down
text: to her work as a SOFT, NOSTALGIC NUMBER from the '40's is
scene_heading: HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW PAN of the Day
dialog: Room.
text: The patients, under the influence of drugs, have settled down
text: for the day. HARDING is playing cards with MARTINI, CHESWICK
text: and BILLY. SEFELT and FREDRICKSON are putting a jigsaw puzzle
text: together in brotherly love. SORENSEN is off by himself,
text: rubbing his hands clean. TABER, pencil in hand, sits
text: pondering over a blank piece of paper. SCANLON paces back and
text: forth. On the Chronics' side of the room, RUCKLY is turning a
text: grimy photograph over in his hands. BANCINI sits wagging his
text: head, mumbling over and over, "Tired, awful tired..." ELLIS
text: stands against the wall, arms outstretched, hands nailed to

text: Bromden is pushing a mop around.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ENTRANCE - STATE HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Staff personnel are SEEN moving in and out of the main
text: entrance where a state penitentiary car is parked. A DEPUTY
text: SHERIFF leans on the fender smoking a cigarette as SECOND
text: DEPUTY SHERIFF comes out of the building and motions down to
text: First Deputy, who crushes his cigarette out, then opens the
text: rear door to the car.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY SHERIFF
dialog: (to an unseen occupant)
dialog: Okay, let's go.
text: A long beat, then McMurphy slowly emerges from the car. He's
text: wearing handcuffs and dressed in faded jeans, flannel work
text: shirt, leather jacket, black motorcycle cap, and heavy black
text: boots. He's been scrubbed clean and has a Band-Aid on his
text: cheek. McMurphy does a couple of knee bends to get the kinks
text: out of his legs as Deputy reaches in the car and takes out a
text: small gym bag containing McMurphy's belongings.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY SHERIFF (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's move it...

scene_heading: INT. MAIN BUILDING - DAY
text: as McMurphy enters the building followed by the Deputies,
text: where Nurse Pilbow, McMurphy's folder in hand, and Washington

text: who hands it to Warren.
speaker_heading: SECOND DEPUTY
dialog: Okay, this is it!
text: McMurphy turns and holds out his hands. As cuffs are removed,
text: McMurphy impulsively takes hold of the Deputy's head and
text: plants a kiss on his forehead.
speaker_heading: SECOND DEPUTY (CONT'D)
dialog: (squirming out of
dialog: McMurphy's grasp)
dialog: Jesus, you're crazy, McMurphy.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

speaker_heading: MISS PILBOW

dialog: (to Nurse Pilbow)
dialog: Ya know, I ain't never been in an

speaker_heading: MISS PILBOW

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WARD - DAY

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Why, I'll betcha there must be a

speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: (to McMurphy)
dialog: Is that so?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay

dialog: head nurse here. You've already met
dialog: Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington
dialog: and Warren.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: Big Nurse and McMurphy stop at the security gate to the men's
text: dorm where Miller opens the gate.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister Miller, this is Mister
dialog: McMurphy, who'll be staying with
dialog: us.
text: Greetings are exchanged as they pass through.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S DORM - DAY
text: as Big Nurse and McMurphy cross down the aisle.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: We do appreciate the way you have
dialog: taken it upon yourself to meet the
dialog: other patients.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Thank you, ma'am...
text: Big Nurse stops at an empty bed where Warren is turning the
dialog: mattress down.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: This is your bed. You may leave
dialog: your things in that cabinet.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yes, ma'am...
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Please use your time to familiarize
dialog: yourself with your new home and if
dialog: there is anything you need to know,
dialog: don't hesitate to ask us.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Now that you mention it, I sure
dialog: would like to call my aunt up in
dialog: Portland and tell 'er where I am so
dialog: she can come visit me.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: All in good time, Mister McMurphy.
dialog: All in good time.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Good. Now if you'll just go along
dialog: with Mister Washington, he'll see
dialog: that you're properly oriented.
text: McMurphy doesn't move.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there anything else?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss
dialog: Ratched. I really am.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
text: They smile, sizing up each other.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking
dialog: for a head nurse.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy.
dialog: Go along.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
dialog: (to Washington)
dialog: Lead the way, Sam.
text: They cross out of the men's dorm.
text: Big Nurse watches them go.
speaker_heading: SPIVEY (V.O.)
dialog: What other work have you done?
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR SPIVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Doctor Spivey is seated behind his desk, on which are several
text: glass-framed photos of Spivey's family, plus a nameplate:
text: JOHN M. SPIVEY, M.D., and McMurphy's papers.
text: McMurphy, freshly showered and wearing hospital-issue
text: clothes, sits facing him.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Hell, Doc, I've been everything
text: from a hoopla man with a two-bit
dialog: carny show to a top mechanic and
dialog: bull goose catskinner for every
dialog: gypo loggin' operation in the
dialog: Northwest till the Army taught me
dialog: what my natural bent was.
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: Oh, what was that?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Poker!
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yeah, but you know how society
text: persecutes a dedicated man.
speaker_heading: SPIVEY (CONT'D)
dialog: In what way?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: They say I'm a habitual hassler.
dialog: Like I fight some. Sheeut. They
dialog: didn't mind so much when I was a
text: dumb logger and got into a hassle.
dialog: That's a hardworkin' feller blowing
dialog: off steam, they say. But if you're
dialog: a gambler, all you have to do is
dialog: spit slantwise and you're a
dialog: goddamned criminal.
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: I see...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: To tell the truth, ever since I
dialog: found my natural callin' I done
dialog: time in so many small-time jails I
dialog: could write a brochure...
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: Yes... Ah, do you know why you're
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Well, ya know, Doc...
dialog: (indicating his papers)
dialog: Doesn't it say so there?
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: (looking over papers)
dialog: Well, according to the Warden at
dialog: Pendleton, you were a disturbing
dialog: influence on others. 'It appears
dialog: that there is a potential in him
dialog: for instigating a revolt among the
dialog: other inmates.'
dialog: (looking up at McMurphy)
dialog: What do you think of that report?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: I don't, Doc...
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: (goes back to papers)
text: Arrested on an assault charge five
dialog: times...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: That's correct, Doc ...
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: (reading from folder)
dialog: The doctor at the prison states:
dialog: 'Don't overlook the possibility
dialog: that this man may be faking
text: psychosis to escape the drudgery of
dialog: the work farm...' What do you say
dialog: to that?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Doc, what can I tell ya?
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: Ah, it seems you have no other
dialog: psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: No, this is my first trip, Doc.
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: (closes folder and sits
dialog: back)
dialog: Well, you're here for a ninety-day
dialog: observation period, Mister
dialog: McMurphy. I'd like you to
dialog: understand you are here on a court
dialog: order and we are responsible to the
dialog: state. So, I'd like your
dialog: cooperation!
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: You bet, Doc!
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: Good. Good.
scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
text: CAMERA is on Big Nurse as she stands, in front of a chair,
text: doing a deep breathing exercise.
text: The patients and staff, standing in front of chairs arranged
text: in a circle, follow suit as best they can. After a couple of
text: exercises Big Nurse sits. The others do the same except
text: Bancini, who remains standing, wagging his head back and
dialog: forth.
speaker_heading: BANCINI
dialog: I'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm
dialog: awful tired...
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: (busy with her papers)
dialog: Somebody please see to Mister

dialog: meeting.

speaker_heading: BILLY
scene_heading: T-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P
dialog: Pete...
speaker_heading: BANCINI
dialog: Awful tired...
text: Billy gently eases Bancini into his chair and sits beside
text: him, patting his skinny knee.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
text: At the close of Friday's meeting,
dialog: we were discussing Mister Harding's
dialog: problem, concerning his wife...
dialog: (reading from logbook)
dialog: Mister Harding stated that his wife
dialog: made him uneasy because she drew
text: stares from men on the street. Is
dialog: that correct, Mister Harding?
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Yes, that's perfectly correct.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: (reading)
dialog: He also thinks he may have given
dialog: her reason to seek sexual attention
dialog: elsewhere, but he didn't say how.
dialog: He has been heard to say to his
dialog: wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever
dialog: want to see you again. You've
dialog: betrayed me.'
dialog: (she closes book)
dialog: So. Does anyone care to touch upon
dialog: this further?
text: Big Nurse waits. A long beat.
text: Harding sits, chewing his nails, tensely waiting, almost
dialog: wanting someone to begin.
text: The patients shift uncomfortably, looking in all directions.
text: McMurphy looks around to see what will follow, when he sees
text: Ellis, nailed to the wall; his pants leg darkens and a puddle
text: of piss forms at his feet. McMurphy looks to see if Big Nurse
dialog: or the Aides have noticed.
text: If they have, no one pays any attention.
text: McMurphy fidgets in his seat, then gets up, crosses to Ellis,
text: unhooks him from the wall, and moves him over a few feet.
text: The other patients are aghast at this move, look at each
text: other quizzically.
text: Big Nurse merely watches.
text: McMurphy crosses back to his chair and sits.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister McMurphy, this ward is a
dialog: democratic community run by the
dialog: patients and their votes, so you
dialog: should feel at ease in your new
dialog: surroundings to the extent you can
dialog: freely discuss emotional problems
text: in front of the patients and staff.
dialog: However, the cardinal rule, and I
dialog: must emphasize this: Everyone keeps
dialog: their seat during the meeting!
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yeah, well, it just pains me
dialog: somethin' awful to see a full
text: growed man sloshing around in his
dialog: own water...
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Yes... We were discussing Mister
dialog: Harding's problem with his wife.
dialog: Now, who will start?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: Billy.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: M-m-m-ma'am?
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Would you like to start?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Mister Sefelt?
text: Sefelt shrugs and sinks into his seat.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister Fredrickson?
text: Fredrickson passes.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister Taber?
text: Taber passes.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister Martini?
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Mister Scanlon?
text: Scanlon looks at the floor.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister Cheswick?
text: Cheswick wags his head 'no.'
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Am I to take it that there isn't a
dialog: man among you who has an opinion
dialog: concerning this matter?
dialog: (no response; she focuses
dialog: in on Harding)
dialog: Mister Harding, you've stated on
dialog: more than one occasion that you
dialog: suspected your wife of seeing other
dialog: men.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: But you have no proof.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: No, Miss Ratched...
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: And yet you suspect her.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Yes, that is correct.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: I can only speculate as to the
dialog: reasons why.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Have you ever speculated, Mister
dialog: Harding, that you are impatient
dialog: with your wife because she does not
dialog: meet your mental requirements?
text: One of the Chronics laughs like a child.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Miss Ratched. Given all the
dialog: conditions of that sublime
dialog: relationship, coupled with the
dialog: subsequent annihilation of all that
dialog: I held to be sacred, mentally,
dialog: physically and emotionally, the
dialog: only thing that I can speculate on,
dialog: at this late date, is how I will
dialog: justify the very existence of my
dialog: life, with or without my dear wife.
speaker_heading: SEFELT
dialog: What's he talkin' about?
speaker_heading: TABER
dialog: Yeah, Harding, why don't you
dialog: knockoff the bullshit and get to
dialog: the point.
text: Several Acutes chime in, "Yeah, get to the point," AD LIB.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: The point is, I will carry on until
dialog: I fully understand what the
dialog: function of that relationship is
dialog: regardless of form or content.
text: Several hands go up.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Yes, Billy?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how
dialog: anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man
dialog: who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
speaker_heading: TABER
dialog: Yeah, Harding, you're so fuckin'
dialog: dumb I can't believe it.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: That's a matter of opinion.
speaker_heading: SEFELT
dialog: Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe
dialog: anyway?
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: Through the ass.
text: Sefelt and Fredrickson snicker into their hands. A few of the
text: others laugh.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: (smarting)
dialog: Is that your sense of humor or are
dialog: you trying to say something?
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: (innocence itself)
dialog: Now what would I be trying to say?
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: I don't know. I don't know, but it
dialog: makes me feel very peculiar when
dialog: you throw in something like that.
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: Peculiar?
speaker_heading: SEFELT
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: TABER
dialog: Yeah, why?
speaker_heading: SCANLON
dialog: Yeah, tell us why.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: I hesitate to go on.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's
dialog: get it all out in the open...
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: I mean, the other day you made an
dialog: allusion to my wife and the
dialog: possible sexual problems we might
dialog: be having. I know that to be the
dialog: case, but the way in which you
dialog: broached it, if that's your idea of
dialog: teaching me something...
speaker_heading: HARDING (CONT'D)
text: (his voice rising as he
dialog: goes on)
dialog: ... or making me aware of a
dialog: condition in my life, then I say,
dialog: categorically speaking, the hell
dialog: with you, Taber!
dialog: I don't have to justify the
dialog: condition of my life to you or any
dialog: of you. No matter what I will carry
dialog: on until I fully understand what
dialog: that function is regardless of the
dialog: form or content. Regardless of the
dialog: fact we must try to understand the
dialog: function of our capacity to obtain,
dialog: to personify the condition, the
dialog: condition of our existence, our
dialog: existence...
speaker_heading: TABER
dialog: You know what, Harding? I think
dialog: you're some kind of morbid asshole
dialog: or something. You've been talking
dialog: about your wife evere since I can
dialog: remember. You know, she's on your
dialog: mind and blah, blah, blah and on
dialog: and on and when are you going to
dialog: wise up and turn her loose!
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: Yeah, wise up, Harding.
speaker_heading: SEFELT
dialog: Yeah, turn her loose!
speaker_heading: ACUTES
dialog: (start pouring it on)
dialog: Yeah, who do you think you are
dialog: anyway?... He thinks he's God
dialog: Almighty... He's a snob... He's a
dialog: schmuck... Dumbbell... Creep...
dialog: Cretin... Idiot... Get rid of
dialog: him... Ship him upstairs...
speaker_heading: RUCKLY
dialog: (chiming in)
dialog: Ffffffuck da wife...
speaker_heading: BANCINI
dialog: (wagging his head)
dialog: Tired... Awful tired...
speaker_heading: ACUTES
dialog: (not letting up)
dialog: Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut
dialog: his nuts off... He doesn't have
dialog: any... Fag... Pervert.
speaker_heading: BANCINI
dialog: (in a strong angry voice)
dialog: I'm tired!
text: Everyone hushes.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Somebody see to Mister Bancini.
text: Two or three Acutes get up and try to soothe Bancini, but he
dialog: isn't to be hushed.
speaker_heading: BANCINI
dialog: Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired...
text: Big Nurse nods to Washington, who goes to Pete, and gives his
text: arm a jerk toward the door. Bancini is unmovable.
text: Big Nurse signals Nurse Pilbow, who heads for the nurses'
dialog: station.
text: Washington senses danger, lets go of Pete's arm, backs away.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: You a good boy, Mistah Bancini...
text: Nurse Pilbow returns, hypodermic needle in hand.
text: Pete turns to his fellow inmates.
speaker_heading: BANCINI
dialog: You see... it's a lotta baloney...
dialog: It's all a lotta baloney...
speaker_heading: NURSE PILBOW
dialog: Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if
dialog: you'll just be calm...
speaker_heading: BANCINI
dialog: That's all it is, just a lotta
dialog: baloney. Ya see, I can't help it,
dialog: can't...
speaker_heading: NURSE PILBOW
dialog: (working her way around
dialog: Bancini)
dialog: Yes, I know, I know...
text: She gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back.
speaker_heading: BANCINI
dialog: ... don't ya see. I was born dead.
dialog: Not you. You wasn't born dead.
dialog: Ahhh, it's been so hard...
dialog: (starts going over,
text: slowly; sighing and
dialog: crying)
dialog: Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful
dialog: tired...
text: McMurphy looks around at the others.
text: Each patient is locked in his own world -- oblivious to
dialog: Bancini's state.
scene_heading: EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY
text: WIDE SHOT of entire court, surrounded by a high fence topped
text: off with barbed wire, as Washington and Warren escort the
text: Acutes -- including Bromden, Ellis, a lobotomy case and
text: several other Chronics -- through the gate onto the court,
text: which is run down, with cracks in its surface and leaves
text: scattered everywhere.
text: Martini, who is carrying the ball, runs ahead, followed by
text: Scanlon, where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic
text: circle, suddenly passes the ball to nothing.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: (as he throws ball)
dialog: Catch it! Catch it!
text: The ball rolls to the corner.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: Martini, there ain't nobody there,
dialog: ya dumb goon! Go get the ball!
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: No!
text: Martini turns away, his feelings hurt. Washington goes after
text: the ball, when Martini goes running after it.
speaker_heading: MARTINI (CONT'D)
dialog: I get it! I get it!
text: But Washington gives Martini a body check and beats him to
dialog: the ball.
text: Martini tries to get the ball from Washington, who is quite
text: agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and
text: Warren start shooting baskets, freezing Martini and Scanlon
dialog: out.
text: The other patients just hang around or walk, as if in a
dialog: prison yard.
text: Cheswick stands in close proximity to McMurphy and Harding,
text: who stand watching the action. McMurphy finally offers a
text: cigarette to Harding, who accepts. They both light up.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Well, say, buddy, is that the usual
dialog: pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py
dialog: shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a
dialog: peckin' party?
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: A pecking party?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: That's right, buddy. And you want
dialog: to know who pecks the first peck?
scene_heading: HARDING AND CHESWICK
dialog: Who? Who?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Ah, come off it! It's that Big
dialog: Nurse, that's who...
text: The other Acutes have gathered around McMurphy and Harding.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: It's as simple as that. You've been
dialog: on our ward six hours and have
dialog: already simplified the work of
dialog: Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in
dialog: one grand analogy: it's a pecking
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or
dialog: Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm
dialog: talkin' about is that crummy
dialog: meeting and what that nurse did to
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Did to me?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Did to you and all the rest of you
dialog: guys.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh
dialog: wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: What did I see 'cept a grown man
dialog: gettin' whipped so bad he can't
dialog: laugh anymore.
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: It's the questions she asks.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Miss Ratched is a competent
dialog: psychiatric nurse, not some, some
dialog: kind of monster pecking out our
dialog: eyes!
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (as calm as blue waters)
dialog: She ain't peckin' at your eyes,
dialog: buddy.
text: McMurphy grabs Harding by his balls and Harding goes up on
text: his toes.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: She's peckin' at your balls, buddy,
dialog: at your ever-lovin' balls.
text: Harding is doubled over.
speaker_heading: SEFELT
dialog: That kind of behavior will get you
dialog: a P.A. rating, my friend.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: P.A. What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: SEFELT
text: Potential assaultive.
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: Which gets you shipped up to
dialog: Disturbed for a nice little zap
dialog: job.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend.
dialog: Five cents' worth of electricity
dialog: and you are out of everybody's
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
speaker_heading: HARDING (CONT'D)
dialog: And if you persist in your ways,
dialog: they can always ship you over to
dialog: Medical Surgery.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: HARDING (CONT'D)
dialog: Lobotomy!
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Lobotomy?
speaker_heading: HARDING (CONT'D)
dialog: (pointing to lobotomy
dialog: case)
dialog: That!
text: McMurphy looks.
scene_heading: SHOT OF A LOBOTOMY CASE
text: A vegetable, complete with two half-dollar scars in his
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: McMURPHY
text: As he absorbs this bit of information the basketball rolls to
text: his feet and he picks it up.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (to Harding)
dialog: Is that your sense of humor or are
dialog: you tryin' to say somethin'?
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Now, what would I be trying to say?
text: Martini and Scanlon rush over and try to get the ball.
speaker_heading: SCANLON
dialog: Gimme the ball!
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: No. Me! Me!
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON (O.S.)
text: Pass the ball, McMurphy.
text: McMurphy crosses to the court, bouncing the ball as he goes.
text: When he reaches the court he holds the ball out to
text: Washington, who reaches for it, but McMurphy snaps it back
text: over his shoulder to Martini.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (turning to Martini)
dialog: Pass it to me, Martini.
text: Martini holds back.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: C'mon, I'll give it back!
text: Martini passes to McMurphy.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Atta boy, Martini.
text: He passes it back to Martini, who laughs and passes it back
text: to McMurphy, who passes it to Scanlon, who passes to
text: McMurphy, who passes to Billy, etc. Bromden just stands
dialog: watching.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (encouraging them)
dialog: Back and forth, that's it. Shoot,
dialog: man, we'll be takin' on the New
dialog: York Knicks before we're through...
text: McMurphy looks to see Big Nurse looking out a window at them.
text: He catches her eye. She turns away.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY (V.O)

text: at the nurses' station talking to Big Nurse.
speaker_heading: SEFELT

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Hit, you say? Well well well and

speaker_heading: SEFELT
dialog: Boogered!
text: McMurphy rakes in Sefelt's cigarettes, adding them to a pile
text: of loose cigarettes, packs of cigarettes, several cartons of
dialog: cigarettes.
text: As Cheswick sits down, depressed:
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: 'Kay, place your bets.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: (holding up a cigarette)
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: That's a dime, Martini.
text: Martini breaks a cigarette in half.
speaker_heading: MARTINI (CONT'D)

dialog: Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
speaker_heading: CHESWICK
dialog: She won't give me any more
dialog: cigarettes!
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: That okay. I'll take your marker.
dialog: How many ya want?
speaker_heading: CHESWICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Lend me twenty.
text: McMurphy counts out twenty cigarettes, marks it down on a
text: piece of paper, and passes the cigarettes to Cheswick, who
dialog: bets all twenty.
text: The Sports have come on TV and McMurphy's attention is
dialog: divided.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (to Big Nurse)
dialog: Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you
dialog: somethin'?
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: (politely)
dialog: Yes, Mister McMurphy?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: How 'bout turning off that music
text: for a while so a man can hear

speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: That music is for everyone, Mister

text: McMurphy leans in, placing his hand on the window.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down

speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: (aware of his physical
dialog: proximity)
dialog: Mister McMurphy, there are old men

text: McMurphy jerks his hand away.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Sorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that...

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Sorry to have bothered you.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
text: McMurphy turns to walk away.
speaker_heading: NURSE PILBOW
dialog: Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (turning back, he examines

dialog: What's the horse pill for, honey?
speaker_heading: NURSE PILBOW
dialog: It's just medication, Mister
dialog: McMurphy, good for you. Now down it
dialog: goes...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Look, miss, I don't like swallowing
dialog: something without knowing what it
dialog: is!
speaker_heading: NURSE PILBOW
dialog: (stepping back a little)
dialog: Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: I'm not upset. All I wanna know,

speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if
dialog: Mister McMurphy does not wish to
dialog: take his medication orally, he
dialog: may...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it
dialog: goes.
text: McMurphy makes a big show of popping the pill in his mouth,
text: holding his paper cup upside down, for all to see, then
text: moving on to Washington, who fills it with orange juice.
text: McMurphy gulps it down, not without some difficulty, then he
text: smiles at all the concerned faces and crosses the room to the

speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Why didn't you tell her to go to

speaker_heading: HARDING

speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: Le's get back to bed, Mistah
dialog: Bromden...
text: Bromden allows himself to be led back to bed. Turkle fumbles
text: around for the security belt, finds it, straps Bromden
text: loosely in bed, then goes off clucking to himself.
text: Bromden reaches under his bed and plucks a stale piece of gum
text: from under the bed frame. He starts chewing it when he sees
text: McMurphy looking at him.
text: Bromden goes right on chewing and looking McMurphy right in
dialog: the eye.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Chief? I wanna ask ya somethin'.
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Oh, does the spearmint lose its
dialog: flavor on the bedpost overnight?
dialog: When you chew it in the morning,
dialog: will it be too hard to bite? This
dialog: question's got me goin', won't

dialog: bedpost overnight?
text: McMurphy holds the last note, reaches over and rustles
text: through his nightstand.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Here ya go, Chief...
text: A small object lands on Bromden's bed. It is a fresh package

speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Now you boys hurry along and wash

dialog: (to McMurphy)
dialog: You too, Mister McMurphy.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Well, say. How 'bout springing a

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY (O.S.)
dialog: What's wrong with you guys?
text: We SEE McMurphy seated with the Acutes, shoveling food down
text: his guillet. The others are barely touching their food.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Why, if I'd have known how soft
dialog: this place was gonna be, I'd have
dialog: arranged for my transfer sooner...
dialog: (holding up his orange
dialog: juice)
dialog: Look at this here, real orange
dialog: juice!
dialog: (slugging it down)
dialog: Hooee, that's good. Why, you
dialog: couldn't pay me to leave this

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: Nobody leaves here till seven

dialog: Mack???
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Sit down, Mister Cheswick!
text: Cheswick sits -- stunned. A beat; then:
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Cheswick)
dialog: You should have thought about that
dialog: before you gambled all your
dialog: cigarettes away. Is that clear?
text: Cheswick sulks in his seat.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister Cheswick, is that clear!
speaker_heading: CHESWICK
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Good...
dialog: (opens her book)
dialog: Now, as I recall, we were making
dialog: quite a bit of headway, last time,
dialog: with Mister Harding's problem. So,
dialog: does anyone care to begin?
text: McMurphy's hand goes up. No one else's does.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, Mister McMurphy.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Right... I've been givin' some
dialog: serious consideration to what you
dialog: told me about the democratic
dialog: something of this therapeutic
dialog: community of ours, an' I got a few
dialog: things I wanna get off my chest,
dialog: before we get back to Harding's
dialog: problem.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Right!
text: McMurphy takes a folded sheet of paper out of his pocket,
text: unfolds it, studies it and begins.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: 'Kay... Item one... I've been
dialog: thinkin' 'bout the age problem we
dialog: got on this ward. You know, the
dialog: young an' old livin' together, an'
dialog: I was thinkin' what a great thing
dialog: it would be if the music was turned
text: up louder. Louder so the old fellas
dialog: could hear better...
text: Doctor Spivey nods with approval.
dialog: Big Nurse doesn't.
text: The Acutes are bewildered.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: But then I got to thinkin', the
text: music is so loud already, it makes
dialog: it difficult for the young fellas
dialog: to hold a decent conversation...
text: Nods and murmurs of approval from the Acutes.
text: Big Nurse can only wait for McMurphy's next move.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Well, I was turnin' this dilemma
dialog: over in my head, when I happened to
dialog: hit on that old tub room out there,
dialog: an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I
dialog: said, that place would make a great
text: second day room. A sort of game
dialog: room for the young fellas. Whadaya
dialog: think, Doc?
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: It is worth considering... Miss
dialog: Ratched?
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: The point is well taken, Doctor,
dialog: but do we have the necessary
dialog: personnel to cover a second day
dialog: room?
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: Well, since it will be largely the
dialog: Chronics who remain here, one aide
dialog: and one nurse should easily be able
dialog: to handle any situation that might
dialog: occur.
dialog: (he turns to the patients)
dialog: What do you think, men, is it
dialog: workable?
speaker_heading: CHESWICK
dialog: Right, Doc. It's workable.
text: Several other Acutes voice in the affirmative.
speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: Fine!
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Good. Good. Yes, yes, I think we
dialog: should give it a trial period. So!
dialog: May we get back to Mister Harding's
dialog: problem...
text: (she sees McMurphy's hand
dialog: up)
dialog: Yes, Mister McMurphy?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: I'm not finished yet.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Go on...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (looking at his list)
dialog: 'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and
dialog: listen carefully to me, you ding-a
text: lings. Tomorrow is the opening game
dialog: of the World Series an' what I want
dialog: is to take a vote on switchin' the
dialog: group meetin' to later on in the

speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Please understand, the schedule has
dialog: been set up for a delicately
dialog: balanced reason that would be
text: thrown into turmoil by a switch of
dialog: routines.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: The hell with the schedule, you can
dialog: get back to the schedule next week
dialog: when the series is over. What I
dialog: want is a vote on it right now!
speaker_heading: CHESWICK
dialog: I second the motion!
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Atta boy, Cheswick!
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Very well! All those in favor,
dialog: please raise your hands.
text: Big Nurse casts a watchful eye over the patients.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (raising his hand)
dialog: Okay, raise your hands.
text: Only Cheswick's goes up.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Come on', what is this crap? Who
dialog: wants to watch the World Series?
text: Martini and Scanlon's hands go up.
text: Several Acutes look at them.
text: Scanlon and Martini's hands go down.
text: McMurphy can't believe his eyes.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: (politely)
dialog: I count only two, including you,
dialog: Mister McMurphy. Certainly not
dialog: enough to change ward policy.
text: McMurphy's hand goes down.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes. Now was there anything else
dialog: you wanted to discuss, Mister
dialog: McMurphy?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: CHESWICK
dialog: No way.
text: McMurphy starts tearing his sheet of paper up into a thousand
dialog: pieces.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: (checking her watch)

text: Harding puts his hands up. No one else does.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, Mister Harding?
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since
dialog: our last meeting I have been
dialog: reflecting, quite seriously, on the
dialog: nature of my problem. Naturally,
dialog: I'm referring to the capacity to
dialog: obtain the necessary results in
dialog: order to obtain... No, no. To
dialog: personify the very existence of

dialog: Yes. The question of...
dialog: Existence... Relationship...
dialog: Function... Confront... Yes,
dialog: confronting us in the moment of
dialog: deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis
dialog: of our souls. Of our souls, which I
dialog: am trying to fully understand the
dialog: problem... the problem. Not to shut
dialog: ourselves off, but somehow...

speaker_heading: SPIVEY
dialog: Yes, that may be so, but in making
dialog: a careful study of your past
dialog: record, along with your behavior
dialog: since you arrived here, my feeling
dialog: is that you are not mentally ill

dialog: Guidance and assistance! That's
dialog: insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.

text: McMurphy starts down the tunnel. The others don't move.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (calling back)
dialog: Come on, you guys, let's stick
dialog: together.
text: The Acutes follow McMurphy. They run down to the intersection
dialog: and turn the corner.
text: No sign of Martini or Scanlon.
text: Somewhere a DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING CLOSED and FOOTSTEPS are
text: HEARD coming their way.
speaker_heading: TABER
dialog: Somebody's coming!
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Shhh!
dialog: (he listens then)

speaker_heading: SEFELT

speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

speaker_heading: ACUTES

dialog: 'Kay, Mack!
text: The band takes off down tbe tunnel, calling out in loud
text: whispers, "Martini! Scanlon! Psst! Where are you?"
text: Down one tunnel and up another -- till they turn a corner and
text: see an open door.
text: They go to the door and peer out. Steps lead up to the
dialog: outside world.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: They must be up there!
speaker_heading: CHESWICK
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: L-L-Let-'s go b-back!

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

text: McMurphy crosses out and up the stairs.
text: The Acutes look at each other. A beat, then:
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY (O.S.)
dialog: Wow! Look at this!
text: The Acutes don't move.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, you guys, come on up here and
dialog: take a gander at this!
text: The Acutes inch their way out the door and up the steps.
scene_heading: EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: H-H-How d-d-do we g-g-get b-back?
text: McMurphy has reached the bus and begins checking it out.
speaker_heading: TABER
dialog: Yeah, take us back to the
dialog: dumbwaiter, Mac.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: I'm not going back in there. I told
dialog: ya this was a one way trip. Now
dialog: stand aside.
text: McMurphy lifts the hood to the bus and begins jumping the
text: wire. The Acutes stand helplessly by as the engine turns over
text: and catches. McMurphy closes the hood and gets on the bus to
text: a chorus of, "Please, Mac, take us back... Please..."
text: McMurphy puts the bus in gear and the bus starts moving. The
text: Acutes start running alongside of the bus calling out for
dialog: McMurphy to take them back.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (shouting to them)
dialog: Get on assholes!
text: They leap on.
scene_heading: EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

scene_heading: EXT. INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. DEPOE BAY - DAWN

scene_heading: DEPOE BAY, SEAMANIS SERVICE, SPORT FISHING, BOATS FOR CHARTER
text: Beyond the boathouse is the dock with several fishing
text: trawlers and beyond that -- the open sea.
text: The door to the bus opens and McMurphy gets out.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
text: (as he steps out of the
dialog: bus)
dialog: This is it!
text: as McMurphy walks directly to the wall, alongside the door,
text: lifts the edge of the siding, comes up with a key, opens the
text: door and enters.
text: A beat, then the lights go on inside the building.
speaker_heading: SHOT OF BUS
text: The Acutes' faces pressed against the windows, looking out.
scene_heading: INT. SEAMAN'S BUILDING - DAWN
text: as McMurphy lifts a cold bottle of beer out of a Coca-Cola
text: cooler, opens it, takes a long pull on the bottle, then
text: crosses to the heater and turns it on.
text: Nearby, a sign reads: ALL EQUIPMENT CAN BE RENTED
text: On the walls are old photographs of people with their prize
dialog: catches. Fishing equipment, tackle and wet weather gear crowd
dialog: the room.
text: There is a counter which McMurphy walks behind and takes a
text: bag of potato chips off a wall rack, full of beer nuts,
dialog: hostess cupcakes, etc.
text: McMurphy eyes the keyboard to the fishing boats. Several keys
dialog: are there.
scene_heading: INSERT - KEYBOARD
text: with the names of the fishing boats: The Lark. Mary Ann.
dialog: Noel. Annabella. The Capri.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING DEPOE BAY - DAWN
text: McMurphy studying the board as the Acutes stick their heads
text: in the door. They're all miserable and cold.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Come on in an' warm up. You can put
dialog: some of that gear on to keep warm.
dialog: An' there's beer an' Coke in the
dialog: cooler an' some food over here...
text: They hesitate.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Come on, don't be shy now, you're
dialog: among friends.
text: The Acutes come in, Bromden bringing up the rear.
text: Martini goes for the candy. Scanlon goes for the Coke. Sefelt
text: and Fredrickson go for the wet weather gear and boots. The
text: others go to the heater. Bromden stands in the middle of the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Why don't one of you boys help ol'
dialog: Chief there get warmed up?
text: Billy goes to Bromden's aid as McMurphy crosses to a window
text: and looks out.
text: McMurphy turns and looks out the window. A long beat.
speaker_heading: CHESWICK
dialog: When do you think we'll be going
dialog: back, Mack?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (looking out the window)
dialog: Come here a minute, Cheswick. You,
dialog: too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys,

dialog: somethin'.
text: The Acutes cross to the window and look out, saying, "What?
dialog: What is it? Whadaya lookin' at? I don't see a thing."
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: Oh, look at the pretty boat.
speaker_heading: ACUTES' POV
text: Nestled against the dock is a trim fishing trawler,
text: beautifully framed in the bay window.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, did you ever see a boat like
dialog: that? Why, I'll bet you could go
dialog: all the way to Hawaii in that boat!
dialog: Tahiti... the Philippines...
dialog: Tibet...
text: CAMERA HOLDS on FULL SHOT of the boat.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: A long beat, then we SEE the Acutes, wearing wet weather
text: gear, complete with boots and squall hats, each man carrying
text: soda pop, food, fishing equipment, etc., being led onto the
text: boat by McMurphy who carries a case of beer.
scene_heading: EXT. FISHING BOAT - DAWN

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT DECK - DAY
text: The sun is up. The engine is dead. The ballgame is HEARD OVER
text: ship's RADIO. The men are scattered over the boat. Taber and
text: McMurphy, beer in hand, are sunning themselves, listening to
text: the ballgame. On the stern Martini and Scanlon are trying to
text: rig up a pole. Fredrickson gives them a hand. Billy has a
text: line out. So does Bromden and Sefelt who is seated nearby,
text: fishing the ocean floor when he suddenly gets a bite and
text: looks over the side, surprised. His line goes straight down
text: into the depths. His glasses fall off into the water. Sefelt
text: sighs and slowly begins reeling his line in.
text: Billy gets a strike and starts fighting the fish.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: H-H-Help!
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Ease up on the star drag, keep the
dialog: tie up, up and work hell outta that
dialog: fella.
text: Martini gets a strike and loses it. Scanlon comes up and
text: starts to take the pole from him.
speaker_heading: SCANLON
dialog: My turn.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: (hanging onto the pole)
dialog: No.
text: They start a tug of war. Fredrickson tries to break it up,
text: when he gets a strike and his line spins out.
text: Billy's fish breaks into the sun in a shower of silver
text: scales, and he gets so excited he lets the end of the pole go
text: down and the line snaps.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Up, I told you! Keep that tip up...
dialog: up! You had you one big silver
dialog: there.
text: Fredrickson lands his salmon in a spray of scales and blood.
text: The fish is flopping all over the deck. Billy grabs the fish
text: and wrestles it down.
dialog: Bromden lands a fish when --
speaker_heading: SEFELT (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, my God! I see something!
text: Everyone rushes over to Sefelt and looks down into the water.
speaker_heading: REVERSE SHOT
text: Deep down in the water a gigantic white form slowly rises out
text: of the depths, becoming solid, alive.
speaker_heading: SCANLON
dialog: Jesus God...
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: We'll never get that on the boat.
text: The fish is now clearly SEEN.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (calling)
dialog: M-M-Mack! M-M-Mack!
text: McMurphy pulls himself up.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: What is it, kid?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: C-C-Come here and l-look at th
dialog: this!
text: McMurphy crosses down and looks over the side.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: He's a big flounder. Could weigh
dialog: two, three hundred. You got to lift
text: him in with a winch.
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: Does that mean we have to cut him
dialog: loose?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Like hell we will! We got the
dialog: muscle standing right here. All we
text: need is a couple gaffin' hooks and
dialog: some rope.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I-I-I'll get them.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: SCANLON
dialog: Me, too.
text: McMurphy turns to Sefelt who is sweating under the strain.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Steady does it, Sefelt!
speaker_heading: SEFELT'S POV
text: The massive fish is closer to the surface.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: All the men are standing by as gaffing hooks and rope are
text: made ready. The fish is gaffed and slowly hauled out of the
dialog: water.
text: McMurphy and Bromden lean over, held by the others, grab the
text: big fish by its gills and, with a heave-ho, the fish is slid
text: in and flopped to the bottom of the boat. The men go
text: sprawling over the big fish. There's a lot of laughter,
text: handshakes and back-slapping going on when --
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (over bull horn)
dialog: All right! Stand to! Stand to!

scene_heading: REVERSE SHOT - ACUTES' POV

dialog: for all to see.

dialog: yourselves?
text: A burst of exuberance as the inmates hold up their fish.
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: (to Sefelt)
dialog: Show her the one you caught, Jim.
text: Sefelt whips the sheet off the big fish.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: My, my...
dialog: No one can find superlatives or gestures big enough to
dialog: describe his catching of the big fish, "brought it in
dialog: himself" AD LIB.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yeah, ya should've come along with
dialog: us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a
dialog: little sun on your cheeks and maybe
dialog: caught a fish or two.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't

speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: No, it was irresponsible!
text: Big Nurse turns to the others, leaving McMurphy dangling.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: (respectfully)
dialog: That's quite a catch, Jim. Whaat
dialog: are you going to do with it?
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: (crossing to McMurphy)
dialog: Gimme a cigarette!
speaker_heading: SEFELT

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
text: (reaches in his pocket; he
dialog: has none)
dialog: I don't have any.
dialog: AD LIBS: "They could use it." "Take a picture first."
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's an excellent idea. Now, why
dialog: don't you boys place your fish on
dialog: the gurney and we'll see to it that
dialog: everyone enjoys a fresh fish
dialog: dinner.
text: The men toss their fish on the gurney as Martini joins the
text: group and starts hitting the others up for a cigarette. All
dialog: he gets for his troubles are a series of "No," "Get lost," "I
dialog: don't have any."
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you, boys. Now if you'll just
dialog: go along with Mister Washington to
text: the showers, supper is in half an
dialog: hour.
text: The inmates start AD LIBBING and laughing, "We're not
text: hungry," as Martini sees Harding light up a cigarette and
text: crosses to him.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: (to Harding)
dialog: Gimme a cigarette!
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: I'm not running a charity ward...
text: Martini snaps the cigarette out of Harding's hand, and takes
text: off with Harding chasing him.
text: Martini dashes around the room, pulling chairs in Harding's
text: way, taking a drag on the cigarette whenever he can.
text: Harding corners Martini, but Martini tosses the cigarette
text: over Harding's head to Scanlon.
text: Scanlon takes off with Harding after him, absolutely livid.
text: Scanlon passes to Billy who passes to Martini. Everyone in
text: the room is getting wired.
text: Martini throws it away as Harding jumps him and nails him to
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: MARTINI
dialog: (holding his hands up;
dialog: empty)
dialog: All gone! All gone! Don't hit!
dialog: Don't hit!
text: Harding starts pounding Martini's head on the floor when
text: Billy and Scanlon jump Harding and start pounding him.
text: Fredrickson picks up the cigarette and stands there watching
text: the fight as he smokes the cigarette as Washington, Warren
text: and Miller move in and start separating the men.
text: McMurphy, watching the fight, sighs, then deliberately
text: crosses toward the Nurses' Station.
scene_heading: INT. NURSES' STATION - MISS PILBOW'S POV - DAY
text: as McMurphy reaches the Nurses' Station and puts his hand
text: through the plate glass window, his fist stopping inches from

text: the SOUND OF THE SHATTERED WINDOW.
scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
text: McMurphy reaches in and picks up his carton of cigarettes.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: I'm sure sorry, ma'am. Gawd, but I

dialog: I didn't even see it...
text: McMurphy turns and crosses back to the day room, opening the
text: carton of cigarettes as he goes.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: You guys want cigarettes! Here's
dialog: the goddamn cigarettes!
text: McMurphy starts tossing packages of cigarettes into the mass
text: of struggling bodies as Washington grabs McMurphy by the arm
text: and tries to wheel him away.
text: McMurphy shakes him off and throws a pack of cigarettes in
text: Washington's face.
text: Washington goes after McMurphy, grabs him, and drives him
text: against the wall, right next to Bromden, who watches as
text: McMurphy shoves Washington away, goes into a crouch and
text: starts circling Washington. Washington dances in and out,
text: chipping away at McMurphy's face until McMurphy drives his
text: fist square into Washington's white, starched chest, drawing
text: him against the wall.
text: McMurphy moves in for the kill.
speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: Warren! Miller!
text: The Acutes have stopped fighting and are watching.

text: Warren, who pulls him back.
text: Washington moves in and goes to work on McMurphy, when

scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY TO DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON
text: as McMurphy, bruised from the fight, and Bromden, handcuffed

scene_heading: INT. DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON

dialog: them.
speaker_heading: AIDE
dialog: (pointing to a bench)
dialog: Wait over there...
text: The three aides go down the hall, leaving McMurphy and
text: Bromden who sit and look at their new surroundings. There is
text: a man sitting next to them.
speaker_heading: McMURPHY'S POV
text: The architecture is the same as the ward we left below, but
text: it is the atmosphere that is different. A heaviness pervades
text: all. Heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other.
text: Others stand shifting from one foot to the other, while
text: others walk up and down the hallway, their locomotive powers
dialog: not unlike that of Parkinson's Disease (caused by too much
dialog: sedation).
text: Suddenly, one patient gets up, speaking very angrily,
text: shouting incoherently at no one; he crosses the hall and
text: enters a side room. An aide goes in after him. A long beat,
text: then the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him
text: back to his seat, talking softly to the man.
text: Further down the hallway, a gurney is wheeled out of the east
text: room with a patient lying on it, out cold; he is wheeled
text: further down the hall to the men's dorms, where he is left to
dialog: sleep it off.
text: Two aides come out of the EST room and head in McMurphy's
text: direction, where one of the aides motions to the patient
text: sitting next to McMurpby.
speaker_heading: AIDE (CONT'D)
dialog: (approaching him very
dialog: gently)
dialog: Come on, Joey... this isn't going
dialog: to hurt you... good for you... make
dialog: you feel better...
text: The patient clings to the bench, terrified, weeping.
text: The aides peel him off the bench and escort him down the hall
text: to the EST room.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: As McMurphy watches the patient go, he takes out a package of
text: gum. Takes a stick for himself and gives Bromden one.
text: McMurphy turns back to his own thoughts.
speaker_heading: BROMDEN
dialog: Thank you.
text: McMurphy looks up. A long beat.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

speaker_heading: BROMDEN

speaker_heading: BROMDEN
dialog: Ca-na-da...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never
dialog: talk! Remember, this is just
dialog: between you an' me. Do ya
dialog: understand?
text: Bromden nods.
speaker_heading: NURSE ITSU (O.S.)

speaker_heading: NURSE ITSU
dialog: Fine, thank you.

dialog: Here, please take these.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

speaker_heading: NURSE ITSU

speaker_heading: NURSE ITSU (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: You comin' in to hold my hand?
speaker_heading: NURSE ITSU
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.
text: Itsu smiles at McMurphy.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yeah...
text: McMurphy gives Bromden one last wave and goes in.
text: Bromden watches the door close behind McMurphy.
scene_heading: INT. EST ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: There are four other aides in there, standing around an empty
dialog: gurney.
text: A DOCTOR is at the head of the gurney, a NURSE alongside of
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (as he enters)
dialog: Hi...
text: McMurphy looks around at the six aides.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: You boys can take a cigarette break
dialog: now...
text: The Nurse smiles at him.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: That's all right, Mister McMurphy,
dialog: just climb on the bed and lie
dialog: down...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Whatever you say, Doc...
text: McMurphy climbs on the bed and lies down.
text: The Doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes
text: McMurphy's pulse, while the Nurse dips her fingers into a jar
dialog: of salve.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (to McMurphy)
dialog: This won't hurt you at all...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Uh, uh...
text: The Nurse starts applying salve to McMurphy's temples.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: What's that for?
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Conductant.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (smiling up at her)
dialog: Surely, goodness and mercy will
dialog: follow this, eh, honey?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (holding a mouthpiece)
dialog: Please, put this in your mouth...
text: McMurphy takes the bit in his teeth. The Doctor moves back to
text: the head of the gurney and places the thongs on McMurphy's
dialog: temples.
text: The Doctor nods to the six aides, who move in and gently
text: place their hands, in a very professional manner, on
text: McMurphy's knees, hips and shoulders. Once set, the Doctor
text: turns to his controls.
speaker_heading: SHOT OF McMURPHY
text: as he looks around, not nearly as scared as he is mystified
text: by the whole process, when suddenly, without warning,
text: McMurphy is hit by the shock. His face is a contorted mask of
text: surprise and pain. His whole body caught in a sudden spasm. A
text: moment of rigidity, then McMurphy passes out and his body
text: relaxes. Another moment, then a series of violent body spasms
text: begin flowing down his body. Now the aides' function is very
text: clear, as they press down, holding McMurphy firmly to the
text: gurney, until the last spasm subsides.
speaker_heading: SLOW FADE OUT

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
text: A Group Meeting is in progress. Doctor Spivey is there.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: (to Sefelt)
dialog: It's been brought to my attention
dialog: that you're giving Mister
dialog: Fredrickson your medication, aren't
dialog: you, Mister Sefelt?
speaker_heading: SEFELT
dialog: It's the Dilantin that makes my
dialog: gums soft!
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Now, Jim, you must be honest with
dialog: yourself.
text: At the end of the hall, the door opens and McMurphy and
text: Bromden enter the visitors' room, accompanied by Washington
text: and Warren. They cross to the security gate, open it and pass
text: into the hallway.
text: Washington and Warren disappear into a room, leaving McMurphy
text: and Bromden, who walk slowly towards the day room.
text: The Group Meeting continues over as Fredrickson raises his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, Mister Fredrickson?
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: I wanna know why the dorm has to be
text: locked in the daytime and on

speaker_heading: CHESWICK
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: Yeah, whadabout our cigarettes?
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Sit down, Mister Cheswick, and wait
dialog: your turn!
text: He sits.
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: If the dorms were left open, you
dialog: would just return to bed after
dialog: breakfast...
speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: So what? Is it a mortal sin? I
dialog: mean, normal people get to sleep
dialog: late on weekends...
speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: With few exceptions, time spent in
dialog: the company of others is
dialog: therapeutic, while every minute
dialog: spent brooding alone only increases
dialog: separation.
speaker_heading: CHESWICK
text: (jumping up as he sees
dialog: McMurphy)
dialog: Mack!
text: Everyone looks at McMurphy and Bromden.
text: Bromden is as he always was, as McMurphy slowly drags himself
text: into the day room. He looks like a zombie as he takes the
text: room in. Then, suddenly, he slaps his thigh.
speaker_heading: McMURPHY
dialog: Hey, hey, you ding-a-lings, you
dialog: creeps, you goons...
text: He enters the room doing a jig. The Acutes' faces light up.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: I got ten thousand watts and hot to
dialog: trot. First woman takes me on is
text: gonna light up like a pinball
dialog: machine an' pay off in silver
dialog: dollars...
text: McMurphy does a full circle of the room, greeting the
text: Chronics. But it's an effort for him. His voice is slower,
text: his footwork slightly out of sync.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Just fine, Billy boy, just fine.
dialog: Full of piss an' vinegar! They
dialog: checked my plugs and cleaned my

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

text: A great sadness suddenly sweeps over McMurphy's face and he
text: breaks off.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Wh-wh-what p-plan, M-Mack!
dialog: No response from McMurphy.
speaker_heading: HARDING
dialog: What's your plan, Mack?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

dialog: (wrapping it up)
dialog: Thank you, boys.
text: The line breaks up. McMurphy crosses to Big Nurse, who sits
text: in the front row.
text: It's the big Saturday game between the Acutes and Aides, as

speaker_heading: ROSE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, pssst! Whadda 'bout me?
text: Turkle turns to help Rose in, but she's not as easy to
text: handle, being a good deal heavier and twice as plastered as
dialog: Candy.
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: Hey, Mac! Gimme a hand, will ya!
text: McMurphy disengages himself from Candy and lends Turkle a
text: hand. Rose is finally hauled into the room.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (giggling; loud)
dialog: Whew! Hiya, boys!
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: Shhh... let's move it away from the
dialog: window...
text: The group shifts a few feet as Turkle closes the window and

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (arms open)
dialog: Come here, sugar...
text: Candy moves into McMurphy's arms as Rose, straightening her
text: dress, turns to see Bromden looming. Rose SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (backing into Turkle)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: (mystified)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: ROSE

text: CANDY points to the patients sleeping in the men's dorm.
speaker_heading: CANDY

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Wow! They're so quiet.
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: They're sleeping, Miss. They're
dialog: sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Are they dangerous when they're

speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies.
dialog: These are nice guys. Nice guys.
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: What's that smell?
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: What smell?
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Smells weird. Smells like

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (to McMurphy)
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (passing the bottle to
dialog: Turkle)
dialog: He's in charge.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Are you a doctor?
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: (passing the bottle to
dialog: Rose)
dialog: Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (drinking and passing the
dialog: bottle to Candy)
dialog: Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'.

dialog: (to McMurphy)
dialog: Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember,
dialog: Chuck.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Well, listen to this. He got mad at
dialog: me one day. Boy, did he get mad at
dialog: me. He took the light bulb, ya
dialog: know. I thought he was going to
dialog: cram it right up me, ya know. But
dialog: he ate it. He ate the whole fucking
text: light bulb.
dialog: (to Turkle)
dialog: Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me!
dialog: Is he crazy?
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: Well, Miss... I would say... I
dialog: would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I thought so.
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: Is he in an asylum?
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: He's dead.
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: Oh, I see. He was a very sick man.
dialog: Very sick.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: That's what I told his mother. And
dialog: she said I was crazy. Her son ate
dialog: the whole fucking light bulb and
dialog: she said I was crazy.
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: I don't know anything about that,
dialog: Miss. I would have to examine you
dialog: first...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You ol' fucker!
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: Well, I'm running a risk by letting
dialog: you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin'
dialog: a risk of gettin' my black ass
dialog: fired. If you understand what I
dialog: mean...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Sure, she understands what you
dialog: mean. She's not dumb. Why do you
dialog: think Rose came to visit us? Rose
dialog: is very interested in hospitals and
dialog: hospital facilities. Aren't you,
dialog: Rose?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: I'll be very glad to show you
dialog: around, Miss...
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle.
dialog: Why don't ya take Rose on a little
dialog: tour of our facilities...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Wait a minute...
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: It's okay, Rose. You can go with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind,
dialog: I'll decide on my own date!
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Shit, Rose! What's there to decide?
dialog: There's only four of us.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at
dialog: least twenty guys in there. Let's

speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: Now, Miss. What do you want with

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: TURKLE

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: TURKLE

dialog: himself.
text: BACK TO McMURPHY and CANDY.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: 'Kay, lets get under way.
text: McMurphy crosses to package of booze, selects another bottle,
text: unscrews the top and takes a long pull, then hands the bottle
dialog: to Bromden.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Down the ol' hatch, Chief.

speaker_heading: McMURPHY

scene_heading: McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE
text: far down the hallway, as Turkle shows Rose one room, then
text: another, and then the seclusion room, into which Turkle
text: playfully lures Rose, who playfully resists, but finally

scene_heading: BACK TO McMURPHY
text: Satisfied, he crosses to the nurses' station, reaches in the
text: open side-door window, opens the door and enters.
scene_heading: INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. MEN'S DORM - NIGHT

dialog: (through loudspeaker; very
text: low, ominous, drawn out)
dialog: Who knows what evil lurks in the
dialog: hearts of men...
text: Ominous LAUGHTER, then the lights go flashing on and off.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY (V.O)
dialog: (through loudspeaker)
dialog: Medication time! Medication time!

scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
text: MUSIC OVER as the patients are queued up at the nurses'

text: McMurphy backing her up, pouring the booze into the cups.
text: Harding takes his cup and moves back into the day room as
text: Ellis automatically downs the booze, gags and goes spinning
text: off across the hallway and is nailed to the wall.
speaker_heading: QUICK CUT TO:
scene_heading: DOWN THE HALL - TURKLE
text: sticks his head out the door to check the scene out. Sees
text: what's happening and comes rushing down the hallway, without
text: his shirt, and zipping up his pants.
scene_heading: INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
text: as Turkle shoves his way to the intercom system and switches
text: off the lights and music.

speaker_heading: TURKLE (CONT'D)
dialog: (pushing)
dialog: Get back in there! In! In! In!
text: As Turkle pushes the last man into the nurses' station, he
text: sees Rose stick her head out of the seclusion room.
speaker_heading: TURKLE (CONT'D)
dialog: (motioning and shouting)
dialog: Stay in there! Stay in there!
text: Rose ducks back into the seclusion room as, simultaneously,
text: Turkle closes the door behind him to the nurses' station as
text: the door to the ward opens and the NIGHT SUPERVISOR, a middle
text: aged woman, enters the ward.
scene_heading: INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
text: as Turkle, shushing the crowd, makes his way to the nurses'
text: lounge and opens the door.
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: (harsh whisper)
dialog: Alla ya goons, get in here!
text: The patients pile into the nurses' lounge, Turkle cramming
text: the last one through the door and closing it. He turns and
text: crosses to the side door and steps out.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: as Turkle steps out of the nurses' station, closing the door
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: NIGHT SUPERVISOR

text: Harding passes by and enters the latrine.
speaker_heading: NIGHT SUPERVISOR
dialog: What are these men doing up
dialog: wandering around?
speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: Ah guess the natives are restless,
dialog: ma'am...
speaker_heading: NIGHT SUPERVISOR
dialog: (getting a whiff of his
dialog: breath)
dialog: You've been drinking on the job

speaker_heading: TURKLE
dialog: Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes,
dialog: ma'am...

dialog: heels.
speaker_heading: NIGHT SUPERVISOR
dialog: I want those men put back to bed,

speaker_heading: TURKLE (CONT'D)
dialog: (calling after her)
text: Night, night.
text: Turkle turns and the smile leaves his face as he hurries down
text: the hallway.
text: O.S. the TOILET FLUSHES as Turkle stops at the seclusion room
text: and sticks his head in.
speaker_heading: TURKLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Be right back, honey...
text: Turkle closes the door, crosses down to the nurses' station,
text: and enters as Harding comes out of the latrine.
scene_heading: INT. NURSES' STATION - NIGHT
text: as Turkle enters, crosses to the nurses' lounge and opens the
text: door to see the patients, silhouetted against the open
text: refrigerator light, moving around, pulling the room apart. It
text: smacks of Dante's Inferno as Turkle snaps on the light and
text: steps into the room.
scene_heading: INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: as Turkle steps into the room and sees the extent of the
text: plundering. The filing cabinet is open. So is the medicine
text: cabinet. Rolls of medical gauze are strewn around, cough
text: syrup and orange juice are flowing.
text: The patients start piling out of the room, carrying their
dialog: plunder.
text: Fredrickson and Sefelt are SEEN sitting on the floor, in
text: front of the open refrigerator, looking through their

speaker_heading: FREDRICKSON
dialog: Christ, they even got my first

speaker_heading: SEFELT
dialog: Lemme see...

dialog: the papers.
speaker_heading: SEFELT (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, they're terrible grades,
dialog: Fred...
text: Turkle stoically takes in the shattered remains of his job,
text: unscrews the top to his bottle of whiskey, and takes the
text: biggest swig of his life as, O.S., Rose is HEARD SCREAMING.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: as Rose, naked as the day she was born, runs screaming down
text: the hall, Ellis loping after her, reaching out his hand.
scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT
text: as the others, who are laying out food, drinking booze and
text: stringing up hospital gauze, turn to see Rose enter the room.
text: She runs behind McMurphy, pressing her body to his, as he
text: gently takes hold of Ellis' outstretched hands.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (to Rose)
dialog: Don't scream, honey...
text: He gently guides Ellis to the wall, with Rose still clinging
text: to his back.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Ellis ain't gonna hurt you... Ellis
dialog: is nice... Nice Ellis... see the
dialog: nice lady...

speaker_heading: CANDY

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Why don't ya go tell 'er...
text: Billy doesn't move.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Go on, son, now's your chance...
text: Billy slowly crosses toward Candy, stopping halfway to look

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: C-C-Candy, wu-wu-will y-y-you mu-mu
dialog: marry me!
speaker_heading: CANDY
dialog: Ah, Billy...
text: Candy rises, kisses Billy on the cheek, and dances with him.
text: McMurphy beams on the twosome, unscrews his whiskey bottle,
text: takes a long pull on the juice, and looks at Bromden.
text: Bromden sits by the window waiting.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - NIGHT

text: them, he puts his arms around them -- as much for support as
dialog: affection.
speaker_heading: MCMURPHY
dialog: Come on, you lovers, it's gettin'
dialog: late...
text: They move toward the hallway.
text: Bromden and Harding are the only two who watch them go.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: WASHINGTON
dialog: Come on, get over there!
text: McMurphy allows himself to be led to the heavy security

dialog: lined up.
text: It is morning and the day room is a mess:
text: A few chairs turned over. Paper cups and empty bottles.
text: Puddles of cough syrup, orange juice and apple juice worked

speaker_heading: BIG NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister Sefelt...
text: Big Nurse's question is cut off as all the patients and

text: Big Nurse turns and starts down the hallway, the laughter
text: trailing after her when, suddenly, the laughter breaks off as

scene_heading: INT. SECLUSION ROOM - EARLY MORNING

scene_heading: INT. NURSES' STATION - MORNING

speaker_heading: OFFICE

speaker_heading: MCMURPHY

dialog: what was McMurphy, for his head is bandaged, and his tongue
text: hangs out of his mouth as he is led across the visitors' room
text: by an ATTENDANT.
text: McMurphy shows Bromden no sign of recognition, which Bromden
text: pays no attention to, thinking McMurphy is putting on the

scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

text: Big Nurse crosses to the side door, opens it, and steps out

speaker_heading: BIG NURSE
dialog: Thank you...
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Yes, ma'am...

speaker_heading: BIG NURSE

text: Bromden can hardly contain himself as he waits for McMurphy
dialog: to go into his act.
text: The Acutes have already absorbed the reality of McMurphy's

speaker_heading: BROMDEN
dialog: (whispering in McMurphy's
dialog: ear)
dialog: When I first came here I was so
dialog: scared of being lost I had to
dialog: holler so they could track me... I
dialog: figured anything was better than
dialog: being lost...
text: On the last word, Bromden places his pillow over McMurphy's
text: face and begins to suffocate him. McMurphy starts thrashing
text: and Bromden lies full length on McMurphy. A long beat, then
text: the thrashing ends. Bromden gets off McMurphy, replaces his
text: pillow, and crosses down the aisle toward the day room.
scene_heading: INT. DAY ROOM - DAYBREAK
