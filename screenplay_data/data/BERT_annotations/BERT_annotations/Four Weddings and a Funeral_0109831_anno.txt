scene_heading: 1, INT. CHARLES'S BEDROOM. CHARLES & SCARLETT 'S HOUSE.DAY. 1.
text: A WEDDING COAT hangs on the door of an old wooden wardrobe.
text: The wardrobe is in a bedroom. The bedroom is white, and tall.
text: There is ornate plaster work on the ceiling, but at ground
text: level, clothes are thrown about on a minimum of furniture.
text: CHARLES is asleep. His alarm clock goes off. His hand sweeps
text: up and switches it off. He stays asleep.
scene_heading: 2. INT. TOM'S B OOM. TOM & FIONA'S HOUSE. DAY. .
text: Another alarm clock is ringing - TOM sits bolt upright in his
text: pyjamas. He is a very high spirited, very affectionate and
text: very stupid aristocrat. He reaches for a shirt and tie, with
text: the tie already tied round the neck, and the shirt three-
text: quarters buttoned - in one movement, he slips them on
text: together, like a late school boy.
scene_heading: 3. INT. KITCHEN. & GARETH'S HOUS DAY. 3.
text: MATTHEW in a very elegant nightgown, making a pot of tea. He
dialog: is 33, clean shaven and very intelligent with a very kind

scene_heading: 5. INT. FIONA'S BEDROOM. & FIONA'S HOUSE. DAY. S.
text: FIONA is tall, attractive, intelligent, aristocratic, 33.
text: Tom's sister and his utter opposite. She holds up two dresses
text: - she puts one in front of her and looks in the mirror - pulls
text: a disapproving face - then holds up the other - pulls a face
dialog: at that too - she doesn't like either of them.
scene_heading: 6 INT. BEDROOM. TT! & GARETH'S HOUSE. Y. 6.
text: MATTHEW is buttoning up his detached collar. He wears wedding
text: trousers, braces, a white shirt. At which moment GARETH
text: passes behind him. He is about 45 - overweight, bearded, with
text: rosy cheeks and disposition. At this moment he is wearing
dialog: absolutely nothing.

text: his bedroom door. Emerging from the door on the opposite side
text: of the corridor is BERNARD, his best friend, also in his
dialog: wedding gear.
text: It is a rather grand, beautifully decorated big house in Eaton
text: Square. TOM knocks on FIONA's bedroom door - she wears a
text: third dress. They're completely ready.

scene_heading: 10. EXT. TTHEW & GAR: 'S HOUSE. DAY. 10.
text: FIONA, TOM and BERNARD pull up in their car outside Matthew
text: and Gareth's charming small brick house where MATTHEW and
text: GARETH are waiting for them. It looks like a little country
text: cottage but in the middle of a London suburban street. GARETH
text: points to his watch, implying they're just a little late. He
text: is now wearing a luscious waistcoat portraying two naked
text: golden cherubs, kissing across the buttons. Now DAVID walks
text: coolly down the street towards them: he's about thirty,
dialog: slender, very good looking.

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Oo, fuck.
text: CHARLES is thirty to thirty five, fairly good-looking, fairly
dialog: ironic.
scene_heading: . -_S 'T'S BEDROOM. C! S_& SCARLETT HOUSE. DAY. 12.
dialog: If you thought Charles's room was untidy, you hadn't seen this
text: one. It is a massive mess, with pink and orange clothing
text: everywhere. A scrawny blonde girl, Charles's friend,
text: SCARLETT, 26, lives there. CHARLES taps her on the shoulder:
text: she is deeply asleep, and, when woken, confused.
text: CHARLES picks up her watch, which is pink and by the bed, and
text: shows it to her. She peeks through sleepy eyes. She's not
dialog: from London and not at all upper class.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Fuck.

speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
scene_heading: i7. EXT. S_& S' "S HOUSE. DAY. 17.
text: CHARLES & SCARLETT charge out of the front door of their
text: house. It is a little run down in a beautiful street.
text: SCARLETT is holding a pink and orange dress, and CHARLES is
text: holding his tail coat and waistcoat. They run round the
dialog: corner, then stop.
speaker_heading: CHARLES ©
dialog: Did you lock the door?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No, did you?
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Fuck it.
dialog: And they run on.

text: CHARLES and SCARLETT are sitting in a seedy looking old
text: Jaguar. The engine chortles - it won't start.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Fuck. We'll have to take your car.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
text: But she only goes 50 miles per hour.
text: CHARLES raises a "want a bet" eyebrow.
scene_heading: 19. T. S' LETT'S CAR. MOTORWAY. DAY. 19.
text: Scarlett's tiny Mini Cooper 'S' is speeding along the motorway
text: at a tremendously illegal speed. It is shaking with the
dialog: effort.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT (V/0O)
dialog: (surprised and delighted)
dialog: Well, fuck me.
scene_heading: 20. SCARLETT'S . MOTORWAY. DAY.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What exit?
text: SCARLETT faffs a little, picking up the map for the first
text: time. They shoot past an exit sign.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It better not be 13.
text: She finds it proudly.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
text: It's exit 13.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Fuck.
text: CHARLES jams on the brake. Reverses 50 yards back up the
text: motorway. Almost dies, then shoots up the sliproad of exit
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: 21. EXT. S' LETT'S MINI. COUNTR' jE. DAY. 21.
text: An idyllic stretch of summer countryside - suddenly the Mini
text: shoots into shot and out.
scene_heading: 22. Tt. WEDD: 1. COUNTRY CHURCH. DAY. 22.
text: It is an idyllic sun-soaked small country church, in
text: Berkshire. Scarlett's mini screeches up, jams on the brakes
text: and skids into a lay-by 100 yards away. CHARLES and SCARLETT
text: leap out of the car, and dress in their formal gear. CHARLES
text: zips up the back of SCARLETT's dress and it catches.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck.
dialog: 
dialog: 5
text: SCARLETT straightens his tie - then holds his shoulder and
text: looks at him.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yes - fuckable.
text: Over her shoulder a large Rolls Royce appears and shoots past
text: them. It is the bridal car. They look at each other. Tiny
dialog: pause.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Bugger.
text: They sprint towards the church. THE BRIDE is just getting out
text: of the car. CHARLES and SCARLETT whip past, with a smile and
text: a friendly wave.
scene_heading: 23. INT. WEDDING 1. UNTRY CHURCH. DAY. 23.
text: The Church is glowing white and be-decked with flowers.
text: CHARLES and SCARLETT survey the weddingly scene of hats and
text: big shoulders. Finally their eyes fall upon their friends,
text: who we've also been following. They head for them. CHARLES
dialog: knows he is late...
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: There is a sort of greatness in your
dialog: lateness.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Thanks. I try.
text: SCARLETT slips in - CHARLES acknowledges them all with a wave
text: and heads on quickly up the aisle to where the groom is
text: standing. His name is ANGUS and he's a little tense. He has
text: a small crafted orange beard.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Christ I'm sorry, Angus.
dialog: Inexcusable. I'll be killing myself
dialog: after the service, of course.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: Doesn't matter - Tom was standing
dialog: by...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Thank you, Ton. You're a saint.
dialog: And..disastrous haircut.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Thanks.
text: TOM gives an enthusiastic thumbs up and heads back down to
dialog: join the friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: As long as you haven't forgotten the
dialog: rings.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Nope.
text: CHARLES pats his pocket confidently. When ANGUS looks away we
text: see a look of concern slip over CHARLES's face - he has just
text: patted an empty pocket.
text: At that moment there is a slam of the heavy church doors -
text: everyone turns around and a GIRL WITH A LARGE BLUE HAT walks
text: in, and down the aisle. She vaguely uses the hat to shield
text: herself against curious eyes.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Tssk. I hate people being late.
text: ANGUS appreciates the effort to relax him and gives Charles a
text: half smile, and at that moment the Wedding March starts.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Here we go...
text: ANGUS turns to look down the aisle at his bride. CHARLES
text: feels his top pocket - no luck there either.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The Bride, LAURA, on the arm of her father, with two little
text: and one fully grown bridesmaid, LYDIA. LAURA looks a little
text: over-fulsome - the row of friends turns as she passes.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Oo, isn't she lovely!!
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Scarlett, you're blind. She looks
text: like a big meringue.
text: ANGUS smiles at CHARLES to share in the joy at his beautiful
text: bride. CHARLES smiles back, slightly nervously.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
text: The Couple as the VICAR starts the service.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: Dear friends - what a joy it is to
dialog: welcome you to our Church on this
dialog: wonderful day for Angus and Laura.
text: CHARLES looks around behind him, trying to find a way out of
text: his dilemma. His eyes land on the GIRL IN THE BLUE HAT. Her
text: hair is lit by a ray of light coming through the stained glass
dialog: 
dialog: 7
text: window. CHARLES can only see part of her face. Then he
dialog: remembers: he's got a more important immediate problem.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: Before we start the wedding service,
dialog: let us sing hymn number 135.
text: They stand - there is a slight wobble on the organ, and a
text: grinding up to tempo as we hear the intro to "Jerusalem".
speaker_heading: GARETH
text: Great grandmother on the organ.
dialog: That's nice.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Quiet.
speaker_heading: cuT INTO:
text: The singing. CHARLES is trying to attract the attention of
text: his friends, all in their row. Finally MATTHEW sees him -
text: CHARLES manages to mime the problem. MATTHEW smacks his head
text: in mock despair. CHARLES does a little plea. He needs help.
text: MATTHEW whispers something in GARETH'S ear. GARETH holds out
text: his hands to reveal no ring. He in turn whispers to FIONA.
text: CUT THROUGH: Four pairs of ring-less hands.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: (Loud whispering)
dialog: Scarlett?
text: SCARLETT gives him a big innocent smile - she is the last
dialog: resort.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: Dearly beloved - we are gathered
dialog: here in the sight of God and in the
dialog: face of this congregation...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (To Angus)
text: Back in a sec...
text: ANGUS looks alarmed as CHARLES walks right to the side of the
text: Church. MATTHEW comes to meet him - they stop at THE BLUE HAT
text: GIRL. MATTHEW does the subtle hand-over, without us seeing
dialog: the rings.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: Therefore if any man can show any
dialog: just cause or impediment why they
dialog: may not be lawfully joined together,
dialog: let them speak now...
text: CHARLES stops for a second - doesn't want to make any noise
dialog: 
dialog: and be mistaken for an objector.
scene_heading: CARRIE - THE BLUE HAT GIRL
dialog: (To her neighbour)
dialog: I suppose the fact he's a terrible
dialog: lay doesn't count?
text: CHARLES hears the comment - now he likes her even more. But
text: he has to concentrate on the matter in hand.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: Do you promise to love him, comfort
dialog: him, honour and keep him in sickness
dialog: and in health, and forsaking all
dialog: others, keep thee only unto him, so
dialog: long as ye both shall live?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: (With total love)
dialog: I do.
text: CHARLES slips in comfortably next to Angus.
dialog: CUT ON: A little later
speaker_heading: . VICAR
dialog: Do you have the ring?
text: THE VICAR moves towards CHARLES, holding open the Bible,
text: CHARLES takes a little step forward and puts the still unseen
text: rings on the book. THE VICAR looks slightly surprised.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: With this ring I thee wed, with my
dialog: body I thee worship and with all ny
dialog: worldly goods I thee endow..
speaker_heading: ANGUS _
dialog: With this ring I thee wed, with ny
dialog: body I thee worship and with all ny
dialog: worldly goods I thee endow..
text: ANGUS slips the ring on to LAURA'S finger. It is a huge piece
text: of pink and purple junk jewellery. ANGUS looks startled.
text: CHARLES plays innocent, and very formal. Then LAURA slips
text: hers onto ANGUS' hand - it is a skull and cross-bones.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A 35 year old man with not much hair.
speaker_heading: . GEORGE
dialog: “If I speak with the tongues of men
dialog: and of angels but have not love, I
dialog: am become a sounding brass, or a
text: clanging cymbal."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Good point.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A couple (CLAUDIA & CRAIG) with an acoustic guitar playing
text: John Denver's classic hit "Annie's Song". It isa sister and
text: her boyfriend filling in while the couple sign the register.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA & CRAIG .
dialog: “you fill up my senses like a night
dialog: in a forest..."
text: GARETH has his head in his hands in despair. A baby starts to
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: (Raising his head)
dialog: oO, bravo.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: This is the sort of song that makes
dialog: you cry, isn't it, Scarlett?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: (In tears)
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The newly-weds leave the Church, the Toccata plays and babies
text: cry in harmony. CHARLES stands at the door as the guests
text: leave. Everyone knows him. CARRIE passes...
speaker_heading: . CHARLES
dialog: Great hat.
speaker_heading: CARRIE _
dialog: Thanks - I bought it specially...
text: She moves on, with a slightly wry smile. She's American. He
dialog: likes her.
scene_heading: 24. EXT. NG _ 1. COUNTRY CHURCH. _D. 24.
text: The wedding photos are being taken. Six quick stills of the
text: family. In the course of the shots a 6 YEAR OLD BOY goes
text: under the skirt of LAURA and emerges smiling. Then is hit.
text: Meanwhile, CHARLES'S friends gather on the sidelines, a real
scene_heading: group, comfortable: MATTHEW, GARETH, FIONA, SCARLETT, TOM,
text: BERNARD, DAVID. As CHARLES approaches he speaks to DAVID in
dialog: sign - DAVID is his brother - and deaf. (NOTE: all underlined
text: lines of dialoque will appear on the screen as subtitles)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Same old stiffs
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes - how did we get stuck with this
dialog: shower _as lifelong friends?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You're lucky, you don't have to talk
dialog: to them. (He turns) Fiona - you're
dialog: looking fucking beautiful - I
dialog: couldn't tell you earlier in
dialog: Church, because of the ‘'fucking'
dialog: bit.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Thank you Charles.
speaker_heading: kkRE
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Splendid, I thought, what did you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: I thought splendid.
speaker_heading: kkek
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Any idea who that girl in the blue
dialog: hat is?
text: They look across at CARRIE who is listening considerately to
dialog: a grandmother.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Name's Carrie.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Pretty.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: American.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Interesting.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Slut.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Used to work at Vogue. Lives in
dialog: America now - only goes out with
dialog: very glamorous people - out of your
dialog: league.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: That's a relief.
text: He sees CARRIE walking away from the Church. She removes her
text: exotic blue hat and casually throws it into a dustbin. She
text: then leans over, slips off her dark blue tights and throws
text: them away too. She walks on - CHARLES watches her go.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Right - reception?
text: They all turn to go.
scene_heading: 25. XT. UNTRY DAY. :
text: The guests are heading down a lane away from the church
text: towards a huge barn. There is a lovely, rural feeling to
text: everything, as though the wedding is a harvest festival.
text: There are pink bows on the sheep they pass. They chat as they
dialog: walk.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Anyone else tread in a cowpat? No -
dialog: thought not - see you in a mo.
dialog: Don't want to blow my chances for
dialog: romance by smelling of dung all the
text: way through the reception.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Do you think I'd hate him as much if
dialog: he wasn't my brother? God. I never
dialog: know what to say in these wretched
dialog: line-ups. .
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: 0, it's a cinch - just say the bride
dialog: looked beautiful and isn't it a
dialog: lovely day.
text: To the side, we see TOM rub his foot violently against a bale
text: of hay. Then another bale gently topples onto him.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: We can't do better than that?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Traditionally, no. Unless you want
dialog: to try "you must be very proud".
dialog: 
dialog: 12
scene_heading: 26. NT. BARN. RECEPTION LINE. DAY. 26.
text: Wife LAURA is hugely gushy, laughy, hugging everyone. Husband
text: ANGUS is smiling, which is unusual for him. Then there are
text: the FOUR PARENTS. At the end stand various sisters, brothers
dialog: and bridesmaids.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: (So sincerely)
dialog: You must be very proud.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (Slightly hay-covered)
dialog: Hello.
text: GARETH and MATTHEW just arriving at the PARENTS' end of the
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Quite superb - it's made Matthew and
dialog: I think quite seriously about the
dialog: possibility of getting married.
scene_heading: FATHER OF THE BRIDE
dialog: Really? And which are the lucky
dialog: young ladies?
text: GARETH is about to explain that isn't exactly what he means
text: when MATTHEW interrupts.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Unfortunately they were busy.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Yes, the life of the air hostess is
dialog: not an easy one.
text: THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE is a little over made-up
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (Whispered to Scarlett)
text: Clothes by Coco Chanel, make-up by
dialog: Caco the Clown.
text: CHARLES now reaches THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE and is as charming
dialog: as possible.
speaker_heading: CHARLES (cont)
dialog: She was very beautiful - although
dialog: perhaps not as lovely as her
dialog: mother...
text: MOTHER blushes happily and introduces him to CLAUDIA, the John
dialog: Denver singer.
dialog: 
dialog: 13
scene_heading: MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
dialog: Why thank you - this is Claudia:
dialog: she's done all the catering.
text: CHARLES shakes the hand of the over-excited Claudia.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Excellent. If it's anything like
dialog: your music, we've really got
dialog: something to look forward to.
text: SCARLETT is just behind.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I thought she looked unbe-fucking-
dialog: lievably pretty didn't you?
scene_heading: MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
dialog: Ah, yes.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I'm surprised your son just didn't
dialog: give her one on the spot, there and
dialog: then.
scene_heading: FATHER OF THE BRIDE
dialog: Well, quite.
dialog: SCARLETT has no real sense of what is the right or the wrong
dialog: thing to say at any given time.
scene_heading: 7. NT. _B; . ‘CEPTION. DAY. 27.
text: The barn is decked out with beams and flowers and ribbons -
text: full of tables, with a long table at the end on a slightly
text: raised dais. Expensive, but with a nice homey feeling to it.
text: The family are upper middle class: there are lots of guests
text: wearing dark suits, not wedding coats - and there are lots of
dialog: flower pattern dresses.
text: Throughout the reception, the background action is full of the
text: business of weddings: pairs of old people standing saying
text: nothing - old person taiking to young person and yawning -
text: people burning fingers on little sausages - children fighting
text: and pulling table cloths and skirts down.
speaker_heading: CUT To:
text: OUR GROUP, in their wedding coats and frocks, ready for the

dialog: i.e not drink?
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Heads it's not one of us 5. Tails
dialog: it's Tom.
text: He spins a coin.
speaker_heading: GARETH (cont)
dialog: It's Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Ah well, can't win'em all.
text: He doesn't sense there might be a trick.
speaker_heading: ' GARETH
dialog: Right - let's mingle. And remember
dialog: - be careful - it's a jungle out
dialog: : there.
text: They all spread out through the party, like 8 errant knights.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: | You ing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I'll hang out looking enigmatic.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Please yourself - I'm a _m wil a

text: CHARLES winds through people looking out for CARRIE - standing
text: on his toes he sees her, grabs a glass, and moves towards her
text: - but at the last moment, another man joins her.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Is that for me?
text: Reaching for the spare glass.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: If you like.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Thanks. I've spotted an ex. I'm

text: CHARLES spies CARRIE, but again she is headed off by another
text: good~looker - she is clearly much feted by men.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Bastard.
text: CHARLES heads for the drinks table to stock up again, by the
text: time he turns, she's alone again. He makes it to her, with a
text: few rushed 'Hellos' on the way.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hello - wine?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: Just as he's searching for what to say, an acquaintance,
text: glimpsed in the Church, slips into shot: he's rather a stiff,
text: 38 going on 60, stockbroker.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hello, Charles.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hello John - this is...sorry, I
dialog: don't know your...
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Carrie.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Delighted, I'm John.
dialog: Tiny pause - who's to talk?
speaker_heading: CHARLES ©
dialog: So tell me John - how's’ your
dialog: gorgeous girlfriend?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: She is no longer my girlfriend.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: O dear - still, don't be too gloomy
dialog: - rumour has it she never stopped
text: shagging old Toby de Lisle, just in
dialog: case you didn't work out.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: She is now my wife.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Excelient. Excellent.
dialog: 
dialog: 16
dialog: CARRIE takes in totally that this is the most embarrassing
text: Moment and leaves them to it, amused.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Excuse me.
text: She leaves them. Tiny pause.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Ahm...any children or anything?
text: CARRIE moves away - she helps herself to a drink. She looks
text: around and there in the corner, sees CHARLES deliberately hit
text: his head against the wall, once.
text: When he stands straight again, an old lady passes his line of
text: vision. He clearly knows her, and smiles politely.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hello, lovely to see you.
speaker_heading: cUT TO:
text: FIONA nearby, talking to an innocent looking fellow, with a
text: pudding basin hair cut.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: The thing I love about weddings is
text: the crying children. They recruit
dialog: each other in creches: "I'll take
dialog: the sermon - could you fuck up the
dialog: vows" What do you do?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: I'm training to be a priest.
speaker_heading: FIONA —
dialog: Good Lord. Do you do weddings?
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Not yet - I will though, of course -
dialog: damn nerve-racking.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Like the first time you have sex.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Well, I suppose so...
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Though less messy, of course...and
dialog: far less call for condoms.

speaker_heading: OLD MAN

speaker_heading: MAN 1

speaker_heading: To OLD MAN
speaker_heading: : OLD: MAN (cont)
dialog: - brain like a small pea,

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: oO, I am sorry.

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen - I'm sorry to
dialog: drag you from your delicious
dialog: desserts: there are just one or two
dialog: little things I feel I should say as
dialog: best man.
text: The guests turn to listen to him.
dialog: Before I start my speech, can I just
dialog: say this - I am, as ever, in
dialog: bewildered awe of any couple who
dialog: make the commitment that Angus and
dialog: Laura have made this morning. True
dialog: love is a very rare and splendid
dialog: thing - and I think we see it here
dialog: today.
text: ANGUS and LAURA are touched.
dialog: This is only the second time I've
dialog: ever been a best man. I hope I did
dialog: the job all right that time - the
dialog: couple in question at least are
dialog: still talking to me. Unfortunately,
dialog: they're not talking to each other -
dialog: the divorce came through a couple of
dialog: months ago.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CARRIE laughing brightly - then back to CHARLES.
speaker_heading: CHARLES (cont)
dialog: But I'm assured it had absolutely
dialog: nothing to do with me. Apparently
dialog: Belinda knew that Anthony had slept
dialog: with her younger sister before I
dialog: mentioned it in the speech. The
dialog: fact that he'd also slept with her
dialog: mother came as a surprise - but I
dialog: think it was incidental to the
dialog: nightmare of violence and
dialog: recrimination which became their two
dialog: week marriage. Anyway - enough of
dialog: that. Angus has asked me to talk a
dialog: little bit about his...romantic
dialog: past.

speaker_heading: ALL

scene_heading: FATHER OF THE BRIDE
dialog: Thank you Charles. Now please,

dialog: dawn. Twist away!
text: CHARLES turns to the OLD MAN.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Catch you for a bop later.
text: He sets off purposefully.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The slightly dodgy Rock'N'Roll band starting 'Semi-detached
dialog: Suburban Mr Jones':
dialog: "So you finally named the day wedding bells will chime. I was
dialog: sorry to hear you say, they're going to be his, not mine"
text: The newly-weds, LAURA and ANGUS, come out and dance. Everyone
text: applauds. She dances rather exotically, he as though this is
dialog: the first time he has ever heard pop music.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Come on Charles - give us a dance -
dialog: no other bugger will.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Try Tom.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Okay.
text: CHARLES is clearly looking for CARRIE - but then there she is
text: on the dance floor with one of her dinner companions.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Damn.
dialog: 
dialog: . / 22
text: SCARLETT starts dancing wildly but enthusiastically with TOM,
dialog: the worst dancer in the world but the keenest.
text: Beside them is GARETH twisting with great vigour with a 50
dialog: year old lady.
text: CHARLES sits down and looks back at CARRIE and her man,
text: dancing quite close. MATTHEW sits down beside him. As they
text: talk, we intercut with the dance floor.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: I remember the first time I saw
dialog: Gareth on the dance floor, I feared
dialog: lives would be lost.
text: GARETH now doing a Saturday Night Fever style dance.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW (cont)
text: But actually he's surprisingly safe.
text: SCARLETT is now dancing very badly indeed. Beside her is a
text: ten year old boy really getting down, then joined by GARETH,
text: doing exactly the same Hi-energy dance. Beside them is
speaker_heading: CARRIE.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Pretty girl, the one you can't keep
dialog: your eyes off. Is it love at first
dialog: sight?
text: CHARLES is slightly thrown by Matthew's perception.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Good lord no - it's the bloke she's
dialog: dancing with - I'm sure I played
dialog: rugby with him at school - trying to
dialog: remember which position he played.
text: GARETH is now doing the bump with a hefty grandmother.
dialog: Bump!
speaker_heading: CHARLES (cont)
dialog: Though, let's say one did take a
dialog: fancy to someone at a wedding: do
dialog: you think there really are people
dialog: who can just go up and say - "Hi -
dialog: I'm Charles - this’ is your lucky
dialog: night"?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: If there are, they're not English.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Quite - 3 weeks is about my

dialog: 23
text: CUT TO: LATER THAT NIGHT
text: LAURA, near an exit - emotionally talking to and hugging some

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: You know I love you, Jean, don't
dialog: you. I love you, I love you, I love
dialog: you and Mike, I don't know you very
dialog: well, but I love you very much, I
dialog: really do.
text: ANGUS remarks to MATTHEW who stands next to him.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: Ignore her - she's drunk. (pause)
dialog: At least I hope_ she's~= drunk.
dialog: (worried pause) Otherwise I'm in

speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: How's it going, Lyds?
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Bloody awful.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: O dear.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: I was promised sex - everyone said
dialog: it - "You be a bridesmaid, you'll
dialog: get sex. You'll be fighting them
dialog: off". But not so much as tongue in
dialog: sight - the amount I paid for this
dialog: dress - and zero. Zilch. Doodle
dialog: squat.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Well, look - I mean, if you
dialog: fancy...or anything, IT could
dialog: always...
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: O don't be ridiculous - I'm not that
dialog: desperate.
text: She gets up and goes.
dialog: ———

speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: No, right, fair enough, good point.
text: General clapping as the couple head out: the bride throws her

text: caught by LYDIA.
scene_heading: 28. EXT. BARN. NIGH' 28.
text: The married couple approach a Rolls Royce with a string of
dialog: cans attached to it - and ‘Just Married' and '3 Months

text: and a big white sheep with a bow on jumps out, accompanied by
text: chickens - a roar of delight.
speaker_heading: -CUT TO:
text: A big cheer as they drive away. CHARLES sees CARRIE walk away

scene_heading: 29. INT. .~ NIGHT. 29.
text: TOM joins CHARLES keenly.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Where are you staying tonight,
dialog: Charles?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Scarlett and I are at some pub - The
dialog: Lucky Boat or something. Aren't we
dialog: all?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Ah-no- slight change of plan - the
dialog: others are in fact coming back to my
dialog: place: I wondered if you'd like to
dialog: join.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Well, no, that sounds lovely - is
dialog: there room for Scarlett too?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: O absolutely. 137 rooms actually.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Tom - are you the richest man in
dialog: England?
dialog: 25
speaker_heading: TOM .
dialog: Oh - no, no. I believe we're about
dialog: 7th. The Queen obviously, and that
dialog: Branson bloke is doing terribly
dialog: well. Well, excellent news - I'll
dialog: go tell Scarlett.
text: As TOM walks away
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (Not hopeful)
dialog: That's unless I get lucky.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (Hopeful)
dialog: Absolutely! !
text: And suddenly, CARRIE is right at his shoulder.
speaker_heading: ' CARRIE
dialog: Hi.
text: CHARLES is taken aback.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: 1 I thought you'd gone.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No - not yet. I was just wondering
dialog: - where you were staying tonight?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Well, I was going to stay at a pub,
dialog: the Happy Boat, or something...
speaker_heading: f CARRIE
dialog: The Lucky Boatman.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: That's right. But now I'm going to
dialog: stay at some friend's house...with
dialog: some friends. Well, I say 'house' —-
dialog: I think 'enormous castle' is a more
dialog: accurate description.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: 0, that's a pity. I'm at the
dialog: Boatman.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
speaker_heading: oO.
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
text: She doesn't give CHARLES quite enough time to recover.
dialog: It's quite a direct invitation.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Well, it was really nice not quite
dialog: meeting you. I'm going now.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: O,no, you mustn't - we could meet
dialog: now ~ the evening's just getting
dialog: going.
text: They survey the fallen-bottle, toppled-chair mess.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I think we both know that's a big
dialog: lie.
text: She walks away.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Fuck.
text: LATER: The camera pans over the proceedings - the sister and
text: her boyfriend are back with 'Stand by Your Man'. Two
text: exhausted hugging couples are still on the dance floor, trying
text: to dance to it. Couples are kissing. Drunk people are
dialog: asleep.
speaker_heading: CLAUDIA AND CRAIG
dialog: "You'll have bad times,

speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: I think the Castle beckons. Ton,
dialog: are you sober?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Absolutely.
text: TOM gives a thumbs up and then trips as they walk out, jackets
text: slung over their shoulders: CHARLES, TOM, GARETH, MATTHEW,
text: DAVID, FIONA picking up an exhausted SCARLETT as they go.
text: They pass a couple kissing passionately. Hold on them: they
text: split: It's LYDIA and BERNARD whom she so recently spurned.

text: The car stops dead.
speaker_heading: CHARLES (cont)
dialog: You know, I think I might just stay
dialog: in that hotel after all.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Why on earth?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'll tell you years from now.
text: ALL of them make a teasing Police siren sound.
speaker_heading: CHARLES (cont)

scene_heading: 32. EXT. CAR. COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT. 32.

text: As the car drives away - they start to shout the chorus of
dialog: ‘Without You'.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Can't liiiiive if living is without
dialog: you
dialog: Can't giiiive, can't give any
dialog: more!!!
text: CHARLES is left totally alone.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Right. Odd decision.
text: He heads back along the road.
scene_heading: 33. EXT. TOWN UARE. NIGHT. 33.
text: A charming town square. The Boatman is a pleasant, large pub
text: hotel, white, with an archway through which cars can drive and
text: park at the back. The name of the Hotel is on big carved gold
text: letters outside. CHARLES enters.
text: The sign shows the lucky boatman getting a blowjob from a
text: mermaid, while his friends are being eaten -by sharks.
scene_heading: 34. INT. RECEPTION. ATMAN. NIGHT 34.
text: It is now about one in the morning. Very quiet. CHARLES sees
text: the bell to ring on the front desk, but just before he does so
text: looks left, and sees a plume of smoke rising from a large
text: leather armchair in the sitting room next door. CHARLES walks
text: towards it.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hello?
text: CARRIE leans over - and looks at him quizzically.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: In the end it turned out there
dialog: wasn't room for all of us.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: You said it was a castle.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes, that's right. Very small
dialog: castle. Tiny. Pocket size. One up,
dialog: one down.
dialog: 29
text: Enter a late night waiter.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: A drink, sir?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'll have a glass of port, thank
dialog: you. You?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I'll have a glass of port too,
dialog: thanks.
text: CHARLES turns to the waiter
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: And another one for the lady.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Sir.
text: WAITER leaves and CHARLES turns back to address CARRIE - but
text: she's disappeared. It's clear why, when GEORGE enters, the
text: confident balding, plump, annoying man who read the lesson in
dialog: Church.
speaker_heading: GEORGE :
dialog: You haven't seen Carrie have you?
speaker_heading: : - CHARLES
dialog: (In a fluster)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Carrie. American girl. Lovely
dialog: legs. Wedding guest. Nice smell.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: i Sorry - no.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Blast. I think I was in there.
text: CARRIE pops up from behind the sofa and pulls a face - he very
dialog: clearly was not ‘in there'.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (cont)
dialog: Look, if you see her, could you tell
dialog: her I've gone to my roon.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Certainly. Dear fellow.
text: WAITER comes in, just as GEORGE is about to leave.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Your port Sir, and one for the...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ...road, excellent.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Actually, I might have one of those.
dialog: Mind if I join you?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Ahm...no, no, go ahead.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: (to the waiter)
dialog: Another port, thanks. And a cigar
dialog: (To Charles) Might as well settle
dialog: in. Let's see if we can get through
dialog: till dawn, shall we, eh?
text: They settle, CHARLES in the chair, GEORGE on the sofa. CARRIE
text: raises from behind the sofa and looks humorously exasperated
speaker_heading: at CHARLES .
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Lovely wedding
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes.
text: CARRIE appears behind GEORGE, crawling towards the door.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I was at school with his brother
dialog: Bufty - tremendous bloke. I was his
dialog: fag. Buggered me senseless, but it
dialog: taught me a thing or two about life.
text: Reaction off CHARLES. Meanwhile CARRIE, on her knees, is
text: almost at the door. The WAITER comes in again. She makes a
text: ‘shush' sign at him, and beckons him to follow her.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Where do you know them from?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: University.
text: He sees CARRIE now talking to the WAITER outside the room.
dialog: 
dialog: 31
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: O splendid, splendid. Yes. Didn't
dialog: go myself...couldn't see the point.
dialog: When you're working the money
dialog: markets, what use are the novels of
dialog: Wordsworth going to be, eh?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Good point. Shakespeare's short
dialog: stories equally pointless.
text: WAITER re-enters formally.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Excuse me, sir - your wife says,
dialog: could you come upstairs at once.
dialog: Room 12 in case you're so drunk you
dialog: can't remember.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: My wife?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: O dear - yes - my wife.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You are drunk if you can't even
dialog: remember you've got a wife!!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes... (does a little drunk mime -
dialog: then, excusing himself) Do you mind,
dialog: if I...? (points upstairs)
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: O no - off you go - best of luck.
dialog: Lucky bachelor me, think I might
dialog: have another search for that Katie
dialog: creature.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Carrie.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That's right. Damn fine filly.
scene_heading: 35. INT. CORRIDOR. THE BOATMAN. NIGHT. 35.

text: CHARLES is slightly nervous.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
scene_heading: NT. ROO!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hello. Sorry about that...
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No, that's fine - he was hard to get
dialog: rid of. (Pause) It's a sad day when
dialog: a girl's got to ask a boy up to her
dialog: bedroom to get any privacy.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes - perhaps we could skulk around
dialog: here and then go back down.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: That's a thought - I don't usually
dialog: skulk a lot, but I suppose I could
dialog: skulk if skulking was required. Do
dialog: you skulk regularly?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No, I don't normally think of myself
dialog: as a skulker.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Okay, so just come in, and skulk for
dialog: a while, and we'll see...
scene_heading: 2. THE BOATMAN. NIGHT.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I noticed the bride and groom didn't
dialog: kiss.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No - it doesn't always happen. "You
dialog: may now kiss the bride" isn't
dialog: actually in the Book of Common
dialog: Prayer.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I always worry that I'd go too far.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: How far do you think too far would
dialog: be?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I dont' know...I think.. (gives him
dialog: a peck on the cheek) that...would be
dialog: all right.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: oO yes - I think so. In fact, it
dialog: might be thought a
dialog: little...dismissive...
dialog: 32
dialog: 36.
dialog: 33
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Maybe. Maybe this... (a kiss on the
dialog: mouth) would be better.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes. You wouldn't want to take it
dialog: any further. I mean...(a long kiss)
dialog: That might be taking it a little
dialog: far. And...
text: This becomes a voice over, as we pan across her bedroom.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ....what about this - do you think
dialog: the vicar would think things had
dialog: slipped a little out of his control?
text: They are naked and making love on the bed.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I think he might...I'd be very
dialog: surprised if we weren't enjoying
dialog: ourselves more than the honeymoon
dialog: couple.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm sure we are.
speaker_heading: . CARRIE
dialog: Why do you think it was called a
dialog: honeymoon?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm not sure - I suppose '‘honey'
dialog: because it's as sweet as honey - and
dialog: ‘moon' because it was the first time
text: a husband saw his wife's bottom.
text: She laughs - for all his early unsureness, she makes hin
text: relaxed, by being so totally relaxed herself.

scene_heading: 8. INT. ROOM 12. THE BOATMAN. DAY. 38.
text: We see the edge of the bed, knee level, CARRIE's legs. Her

text: move round to see CHARLES still fast asleep. He slowly wakes,
text: opens his eyes and looks up. Again, her face is caught in
text: beautiful light.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What's happening?
dialog:

speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Three hours.
speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Just before I go - when are you
dialog: thinking of making the announcement?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What announcement?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: The engagement.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Whose engagement?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Ours. I assumed since we'd slept
dialog: together and everything, weld
dialog: probably get married. What were you
dialog: thinking?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Ah, gosh, look, this sort of thing
dialog: takes a lot of thought, I obviously
dialog: ahm...
text: Then he suddenly sees she's smiling.
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: CHARLES (cont)
dialog: You're joking?
speaker_heading: CHARLES (cont)

speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Wonderful news.
text: Up at the front, the young priest steps forward into position

text: boys follow, unruly as usual, wandering all over the shop.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Why do page boys always look like
dialog: they're on drugs?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: They are - the priest gives them a

text: Five minutes later the couple are walking down the aisle -
text: accompanied by perky organ playing. LYDIA's dress is totally
text: covered in ink from FATHER GERALD's pen.
text: As the newly weds leave the Church, the usual sudden surge of
text: chatter. There is a new bond forged between CHARLES and
dialog: CARRIE because of the disasters during the service. We
dialog: suspect things are going to go very well between them.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I thought you'd gone to America. We
dialog: could've been married by now if
dialog: you'd just rung me.
text: She turns to the man beside her. He's 50 - older - silver

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Excellent - how do you do, Hamish -
dialog: delighted to meet you. What a
dialog: charming surprise to find Carrie
dialog: back in the country.
speaker_heading: HAMISH
dialog: Yes, well, she took some persuading.
dialog: Come on darling, let's not actually

scene_heading: 49. OTEL. ENT: CE HALL. DAY. 49.
text: The Reception takes place in a beautiful large London
text: Ballroom, downstairs in an expensive Hotel. This is a very
text: aristocratic wedding. All men are in full wedding gear,
text: there's a lot of silk and posh voices.
text: At the entrance there is a table where people put their gifts.
text: GEORGE, from the Boatman, approaches the table with a huge
text: present, beautifully wrapped. He puts it down and heads to
dialog: join the line.
text: Next GARETH sweeps in - he puts down a very small unimpressive
text: looking gift. He inspects the other gifts, looks around to
text: check no-one is watching and swaps the card on his with the
text: card on George's present. He smiles happily and heads down
text: the sweeping staircase to the ballroom. .
text: He passes the long queue and simply joins his friends at the
text: front near the beginning of the receiving line. The bride is
text: in her still splattered dress.
speaker_heading: 44
text: Standing at the front of the line is someone '‘liveried', The
text: Master of Ceremonies. He dips his head and has a word with
dialog: every guest, very discreetly...
scene_heading: MASTER OF CEREMONIES
dialog: I think you should know that Lord
dialog: Hibbott is a little deaf, sir.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: oO thank you

speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: (Very loud)
scene_heading: EXCELLENT WEDDING - I WAS IN HEAVEN

speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: (worried) Yes.

speaker_heading: FIONA

scene_heading: 9 YEAR OLD RIGHT HONOURABLE HARRY
dialog: I'm the groom's brother. You?
speaker_heading: LADY JANE

speaker_heading: HON HARRY

speaker_heading: LADY JANE
dialog: oO. I must tell Lydia - she says she
dialog: wants to know everything about
dialog: Bernie.
speaker_heading: curT TO:
text: GARETH, MATTHEW, DAVID, CHARLES. GARETH is sipping
dialog: excellent Champagne.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: ' Ah, that's better. Marriage: it's
dialog: like the Masons isn't it. You can't
dialog: ask to join the club. You just have
dialog: ! to wait till true love knocks on
dialog: your door and gives you the funny
dialog: handshake. Then suddenly, there you
dialog: are, saying 'I do'.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Precisely - it's so random there's
dialog: no point looking in my opinion.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: I'm not sure about 'random'.- I do
dialog: think handsome boys tend to marry
dialog: handsome girls..
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Not a rule, though, is it - Prince
text: Philip's a good-looking man, while
dialog: on the other hand, the Queen...
text: TOM passes by, looking busy about his duties.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Ah Thomas, how's the speech?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Pretty good I think - something for
dialog: everyone - tears, laughter...
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Excellent.
text: TOM does a double thumbs up and heads on.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: If like does marry like, where do I
dialog: fit in then?
dialog: 46
dialog: 
dialog: 47
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Well, I'm better on men than women:
dialog: for instance...him (very pretty boy)
dialog: no chance, whereas him (old man) you
dialog: could probably do hetter.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: And girls...
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Well, let's see. Her (a total
dialog: beauty) I wouldn't get over
dialog: optimistic
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No..
text: But suddenly the pretty woman heads straight towards him
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: oO my God.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Stay calm. I feel a funny handshake
dialog: coming on - I'll make myself scarce,
dialog: look I'm gone.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No, st......

speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: God yes, that's right. Having a
dialog: good time?
speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN
dialog: So so, so far...
text: And over her shoulder is GARETH with a big thumbs up and
text: CHARLES raises his eyebrows - yes there may be something here.
text: GARETH turns and walks through a crowd of chattering upper
dialog: class voices - lots of 'splendid' 'Roderick!' and 'Do you know
text: Geraldine?' He passes the Priest and acknowledges him
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Father: sublime service.
text: Actually FATHER GERALD is talking to SCARLETT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 48
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Yes, you were great.
speaker_heading: FATHER GERALD
dialog: Did you think so? I thought I
dialog: cocked it up a little.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Well, now you say it, you did
dialog: totally - but don't worry - it's
dialog: usually so boring, and I really
dialog: enjoyed it this time.
text: CHARLES and THE PRETTY WOMAN are getting on famously. They
text: take a nibble each as a tray passes by.
speaker_heading: CHARLES :
dialog: .--almost had enough of weddings
dialog: actually. I've been to 7 this year.
speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN
dialog: You must get bored af champagne and
dialog: salmon.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes, catering's always the problen.
dialog: The worst one I went to, the sister
dialog: had done it. Unbelievable - though
dialog: at least one knew who to lie to.
speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It just seems as though it's
dialog: impossible to get it right. I mean
dialog: look at this. Suppose it's meant to
dialog: be asparagus - but it looks and
text: tastes like a dead man's penis.
dialog: Now, tell me, what do you do?
speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN
dialog: I'm a caterer.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Good Lord - so you know what I'm
dialog: talking about. Do you ever do
dialog: weddings?
speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
dialog: 49
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: They should have asked you to do
dialog: this one.
speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN
dialog: They did.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: God - I wish you hadn't turned it
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN
dialog: I didn't.
scene_heading: _LONG PAUSE.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Excellent. Excellent. If you'll
dialog: just excuse me a moment, I think
dialog: this knife should be sharp enough
dialog: for the de-testiculation process.
text: As he moves away, he again is passed by CARRIE and HAMISH.
dialog: curt ON TO:
speaker_heading: GARETH :
dialog: Don't worry - let's have a look -
dialog: I'm sure you'll be sitting next to

text: GARETH who stole the present replies...
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: oO yes. It's months, isn't it,

dialog: Are you a lesbian?
dialog: 
dialog: ~~ wry wer —w
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CHARLES'S table ~ DAVID seems to be relishing the situation.
text: CHARLES is just that little bit tense.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: MRS BEAUMONT
dialog: Well, it's one of the possibilities
dialog: with unmarried women, and a bit more
dialog: interesting than saying - "O dear,
dialog: just haven't met the right chap,
dialog: eh"?
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Good on you, I always assume middle-
dialog: aged people are dull and totally the
dialog: same - it's lovely to meet one who
dialog: isn't.
speaker_heading: MRS BEAUMONT
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: No, truth is, though, I have met the
dialog: right man - unfortunately, he
dialog: doesn't love me - and until I stop
dialog: loving him, no-one else stands a
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: MRS BEAUMONT
dialog: Bad luck.
speaker_heading: FIONA .
dialog: Isn't it? I was a lesbian once, at
dialog: school - but only for an hour and a
dialog: half, so I don’t think it counts.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: So there are 400 different kinds of
dialog: tea and that isn't including all
dialog: these so-called fruit teas. I took

speaker_heading: NIKKI

speaker_heading: VERONICA

speaker_heading: NICKI
dialog: O well, when Charles and I were

dialog: India with ‘Vomiting Veronica' I
dialog: think that was it.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Seriously, I don't remember ever
dialog: mentioning it.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: O come on Charles, I don't think
dialog: I've ever been out with. anyone less

speaker_heading: IRIS (cont)

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I remember this - you couldn't work

text: to accept her advances.
speaker_heading: NICKI
dialog: That's right! Mrs Piggy - Helena was
dialog: Miss Piggy, so her mother was Mrs
dialog: Piggy.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes, I think perhaps...
dialog: 53
text: Everyone can't but notice that he is looking massively

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Don't tell me - I know.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: She asked us all round to dinner.
dialog: Apparently her fiancee is terribly

dialog: How were you?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I seem to be stuck in the wedding
dialog: from hell. The next thing you know,
dialog: I'll bump into Henrietta and the

text: From behind him comes a voice
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Hello, Charles.
text: He turns around, and there is a strained looking girl.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hello, Hen. How are you?
text: PAUSE. Then her face just collapses. She bursts into
dialog: tears...
speaker_heading: CHARLES (cont)
dialog: O Hen..
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA'S FRIEND
dialog: Look, can't you just leave her alone
dialog: - haven't you hurt her enough?
text: And takes her away. CHARLES turns to GARETH.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ‘Excuse me’ - I think I better be

text: As CHARLES walks out, he passes DAVID.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Just saw Henrietta.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You ruined her life, you heartless

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Thanks fo: our s rt.
text: CHARLES then passes SERENA and the camera stays with her.
text: She approaches DAVID, easing up to him as before, via the
text: canapes- She misjudges it and bumps into hin.
speaker_heading: SERENA
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: He waves it away - no matter. She stands opposite hin.
text: Pause. Then she starts to sign, very slowly. The subtitles
dialog: translate.

speaker_heading: SERENA
dialog: Hello, my name is Serena.
text: DAVID laughs sweetly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello, Serena.

text: CHARLES, with the sound of music in the background - he
text: looks along a corridor, then nips into a little room, where
dialog: he can be alone.
scene_heading: 52. - HOTEL. ROOM. NIGHT. 52.
text: It contains just a bed and a dressing table. On the bed is
text: a suit, and a girl's skirt and blouse. He goes to the
text: window, and, peaceful at last, looks out over London.
text: There is a sound - he turns around, and sees the door
text: opening. BERNARD and LYDIA enter the room - they don't see
text: him - but turn and quickly lock the door. It is in fact
text: the room for changing into their going away clothes.
text: CHARLES is a little worried by this.
speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: I'll turn off the light - don't want
dialog: to attract attention.
text: CHARLES nods. The light goes out, in the darkness we hear

speaker_heading: LYDIA

dialog: him.
text: CUT IN: close on them, then pan around - and CHARLES has
text: disappeared. The couple are now almost naked: The camera
text: moves down to under the bed, where we expect CHARLES to be.
text: There seems to be nowhere else in the room where he could
dialog: fit.
text: Finally he emerges from a suitcase, as behind him the
text: couple are having sex. He crawls towards a dressing table,
text: which has little curtains under it. He crawls between them
text: - at last he is protected. He looks at his watch. This
dialog: could be a long haul...

speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: No. 'Fraid not.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I don't know - chaps I fancy think

dialog: I think they're stupid and can't

speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: I see.

speaker_heading: BERNARD
dialog: Still, we better be going back.

speaker_heading: LYDIA

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: That's awfully kind, Hen, but...
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: The thing is, Charlie, I've spoken
dialog: to lots of people about you.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: O God -
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA :
dialog: Everybody agrees - you'll never
dialog: really love anyone, because you
dialog: never let them near you. You're
dialog: sweet to them, and affectionate to
dialog: them... you were even sweet to me
dialog: and you thought I was an idiot.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I did not!
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: You did. I thought U2 was a type of

speaker_heading: . CHARLES
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: But it's like from the beginning of

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Well, sometimes, I admit - I mean,
dialog: take that girl with the big knife.
dialog: 
dialog: 59
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Be serious Charles! You must give

dialog: mustn't think "I mustn't get

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hen, you know me - most of the time
dialog: I don't think at all - I just potter
dialog: along.
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
text: Q Charles (She suddenly puts her

dialog: -beat us with sticks. .
text: CHARLES laughs. During the scene, they are both eating the
text: slice of cake - but neither will finish it. At first this
dialog: is quite reasonable - they each take little pieces with
text: their forks, leaving enough for the other. But finally
text: they're actually dividing the crumbs.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: One really strange thing is thinking
dialog: you'll never sleep with anyone else.
dialog: You don't think you'll ever be
dialog: unfaithful?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No - not once we're married - I've
dialog: told Hamish I'll kill him if he is -
dialog: so I think I better stick by that.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Quite right. Although just before
dialog: he died John Betjeman was asked if
dialog: he had any regrets in life and he
dialog: said he wished he'd slept around
dialog: more.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No - I reckon I've had a fair run at
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: How many is a fair run these days?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: 0, I don't know - more than... one.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Like - how many? I've seen the
dialog: dress - I can take anything now.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Well...
text: At first she's unwilling, but then she gets drawn in,
text: counting them out on her fingers.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (cont)
dialog: Okay - let's see. Right - 1 - not
dialog: easily forgotten. Kind of nice. 2
dialog: - mistake, hairy back. 3 ~ lovely,
dialog: getting into the swing of it now. 4,
dialog: 5, 6, that was my birthday present.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Which birthday?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Sixteen I think.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: We've only reached sixteen?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: That's right: I was brought up in
dialog: the country - endless fooling around
dialog: in barns. Then there was 7 - yummy
dialog: - 8 - yummy yummy - 9 - against a
dialog: fence - really uncomfortable — don't
dialog: try it...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Then 10 - ah, 10 - he was the really
dialog: annoying one we all have, when you
dialog: say, "o no , why didn't I know all
dialog: this stuff before?" - I wasted one
dialog: to nine. 11 - obviously, in the
dialog: circumstances, very disappointing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES mouths
dialog: : 74
speaker_heading: CARRIE (cont)
dialog: 12 - still recovering. 13 - 90, so
dialog: there's even more to it. 14, 15, 16,
dialog: 17 - the University years - lovely,
dialog: intelligent, sensitive boys -
dialog: sexually speaking, a real low patch.
dialog: 18 - he broke my heart. Long years
dialog: of yearning.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: After which came 19 - who I don't
dialog: remember, but my room-mate said we
dialog: definitely did it - 20 - long one -
dialog: 3 years. 21 - my Fatal Attraction.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: He went crazy?
speaker_heading: CARRIE .
dialog: No, he looked like Michael Douglas.
dialog: 22 - that was my first year in
dialog: England ~- I love English guys - 23
dialog: and 24 together, which was
dialog: something...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No, it was a holiday, I was brown,
dialog: they were foreign, sure beat
dialog: conversation, and we're still ages
dialog: before AIDS. 25 - gorgeous - older
dialog: man. 26 - dreadful - older man. 27
dialog: - that was a mistake.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Suddenly at 27 you make a mistake?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: He had a really bad cold - I thought
dialog: it wouldn't matter - it did.
dialog: Actually there are a few nasty ones
dialog: round here - lots of rather grand
dialog: Frenchman I thought were glamorous.
dialog: Very nearly gave up on the whole
dialog: thing. But Spencer changed ny mind,
dialog: that's 28. His father - 29...
dialog: 'HIS FATHER! !'
dialog: 
dialog: 75
speaker_heading: CARRIE (cont)
dialog: Then 30 - he shouted a lot, which I
dialog: found odd, 31 - fine, 32 - lovely.
dialog: And my fiancee - 33.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: So I came after your fiancee
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No, you were 32.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: O thank you.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: So there we have it - something to
dialog: tell my daughters. Now what about
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (panic) Me?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Yes - how many girls have you slept
dialog: with?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: © God, ahm, well, nothing like that
dialog: many. I don't know what the fuck
dialog: I've been doing with my time
dialog: actually. Work probably - that's
dialog: it. Work.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Well, go on.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Ahn, well, lets see -
text: He counts on his fingers - 1,2,3. Pause. 4th finger. Long
dialog: pause.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: o, it must be about twenty.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No, go on, try harder.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (He just can't come up with the
dialog: numbers) Five... six... all right,
dialog: about 15.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: My husband says he's slept with 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 76
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: That's a lie - he's lying. He's a
dialog: filthy liar.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Apparently not. He was very perky
dialog: in his 30's.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Was he? 0, God. I've wasted ny
dialog: life! Here I am, having tea when I
text: should be out scouring the streets.
dialog: Look, do you mind if I pay 'n' run,
dialog: I've got serious shagging to do.
text: She laughs. Both of them just stop talking. CHARLES
text: watches her sipping her tea, and smiles. Something's
text: happened. She has a bite of cake - then looks at him
text: calmly - he snaps out of it.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Sorry - Sorry. (Pause) I wish I'd
dialog: rung you. (She smiles) But then you
dialog: didn't ring me _ either. You
dialog: ruthlessly slept with me twice, and
dialog: then never rang me.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: (gentler) That's another strange
dialog: thing about getting married - you
dialog: look back on all the people you've
dialog: been with, and...you get sentimental
dialog: about them, and you think about
dialog: other decisions you might have made.
text: They look at each other. Pause. She decides to break it.
dialog: -+-Who knows, maybe I should have given
dialog: the guy with the hairy back another chance -
dialog: there are creams.
dialog: They both laugh. These are two people who should be
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I have to go soon.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: O Christ - (looks at his watch) -
dialog: come with me - be my excuse.

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: CHARLES

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I know this is a stupid question -
dialog: particularly in view of our recent
dialog: shopping trip - but I just wondered
dialog: whether you're sure - well, of
dialog: course you're sure, but I just
dialog: wondered whether there's any chance
dialog: - I mean, obviously not, I'm just
dialog: some git who's only slept with 9
dialog: people but I just wondered whether -
dialog: I know I'm going to regret this even
dialog: as I say it, but I really
dialog: feel...ahm...in short, ina slightly
dialog: clearer version - in the words of
dialog: David Cassidy in fact - 'I think I
dialog: love you' and I wonder whether you
dialog: wouldn't by any chance like to...no,
dialog: of course not, that's the answer

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: The thing is...I just feel...you

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I'm getting married in 14 days

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes. I agree. I just wanted to have
dialog: said it -
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Said what?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Well, (absolutely rushes it) would
dialog: you like to marry me...just in case
dialog: you're being forced into this
dialog: marriage by some kind of hideous

dialog: Well, don't look at me: I've asked

dialog: ask.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No, any time.
speaker_heading: GARETH
dialog: Be that as it may - I want to set
dialog: you a challenge - find husbands and
dialog: wives. Weddings are the ideal time
dialog: for it. Matthew and I are in a
dialog: slightly special position, and we
dialog: will try to entertain the Americans
dialog: - but the rest of you - please -
dialog: conjugate! I'd like to go to the

dialog: you were right, Hen - perhaps we

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm sure I could change: right girl,
dialog: right railway station...

dialog: turning up to a wedding - and yet
dialog: here you Americans are. Thank you.

dialog: - 3 times - and I'm really sorry.
dialog: The third point is the important one
dialog: - if my. darling Dad had been here
dialog: today, he would have been speaking
dialog: now - and I know what he would have
dialog: said - "cute dress, babe, but why
dialog: the hell are you marrying the stiff
dialog: in the skirt?"
text: TOM roars with laughter - he's very impressed at her cheek.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (cont)
dialog: And I would have given him the same
dialog: answer I give you - ‘because I love
dialog: him.' As John Lennon, who died the
dialog: same year as ny Dad, said - "Love is
dialog: the answer - and you know that for
dialog: sure". I do know - and I'm sure.
text: They all clap as she sits down. CHARLES can't believe he
dialog: let her go.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: This is the last wedding I'm going
dialog: i to - I mean it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90
text: DAVID quietly pats his brother's shoulder. Now the
text: applause dies down and CARRIE just gets to her feet again.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: oO, final thing - someone here asked
dialog: me to marry them last week - and the
dialog: answer is - ‘yeh, okay, if this
dialog: doesn't work out'.
text: It's an outrageous thing to say, and HAMISH roars with
text: laughter. CHARLES looks at her.
scene_heading: FREDERICK - THE BEST MAN
dialog: Splendid. And now, my Lords, Ladies
dialog: and gents, my dear friend and yours,
dialog: Mr Hamish Banks.
text: CHARLES shakes his head in dismay. HAMISH is
text: confident in his years and social position.
speaker_heading: _ DAVID
dialog: Imean, how old is he? 2,000, 3,000
dialog: years o1d?
speaker_heading: HAMISH
dialog: Anyone involved in Conservative
dialog: politics over the past 20 years has
dialog: got used to being upstaged by a
dialog: woman. But I didn't expect it to
dialog: happen on my wedding day. That
dialog: said, it couldn't have been done by
dialog: a more wonderful woman, one by whom
dialog: I am quite happy to be upstaged for
dialog: the rest of my life.
text: Loud "Bravo!". In the background there is a
text: clatter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: GARETH has stumbled backwards.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: HAMISH (cont'd)
dialog: First, I'd like to extend ny
dialog: compliments to the bridesmaids - and
dialog: of course the excellent page boys -
dialog: they did their duties superbly - and
dialog: obviously I intend to use you all
dialog: every time I get married from now
dialog: on.
text: He looks at CARRIE - he has teased her back.
dialog: laughter.
dialog: smooth,
dialog: slight
dialog: More
dialog: 
dialog: 91
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
text: GARETH. He falls further, pulling a table cloth. A bottle
text: falls and smashes as he tugs it. Then back...
speaker_heading: HAMISH
dialog: O dear, barracking at the back - so
dialog: it is a political speech after all!
text: Most of the audience are still listening to him, and most
text: laugh. CHARLES moves to GARETH. DAVID and TOM are with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: We're going to need a Doctor. Ton.
text: DAVID cradles GARETH's head on his knee. The fuss at the
text: back is now discreet.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: All right - leave it to me.
text: TOM is suddenly another version of himself - responsible,
dialog: caring - this is how he will be with his family, on his
dialog: farn.
dialog: CUT TO: The podium
speaker_heading: HAMISH
dialog: One expects the unexpected at a
dialog: wedding - but I must admit heckling
dialog: comes aS a genuine surprise. But
dialog: you know, these Scottish
text: Nationalists are very determined.
text: Some laughter.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (very quiet and calm)
dialog: Let's move him into the next roon.
text: They begin to move hin.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
text: HAMISH has no idea what's occurred.
speaker_heading: HAMISH
dialog: I'd also like to thank all the

dialog: 92
speaker_heading: HAMISH (cont'd)
dialog: flushed youth today - more I fear
dialog: than can be said for the bridegroom.
text: Everyone laughs.
scene_heading: 80. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT. 80.
text: This is the room they have moved Gareth to. It is huge and
text: empty. There is a sharp contrast between the two rooms -
text: one absolutely packed and full of laughter, the other
text: still, with six small figures alone in a big space. We see
text: GARETH's fabulous waistcoat being unbuttoned. FIONA,
text: DAVID, CHARLES, TOM are there.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Is he going to be all right?
text: THE DOCTOR looks at him, with no hope in his face.
scene_heading: 8 NT. SCOTTIS R USE. Cc: ON. NIGHT. 81.

dialog: ...twice her age, half her brains..
text: Big roar of laughter. Powerful music plays.
scene_heading: 2. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. NIG! 82.
text: In the room next door something has happened. It is like
text: a tableau. FIONA is trying desperately not to cry. TOM is
text: standing with his hands behind his neck. DAVID is holding
text: GARETH'S head. There is a kerfuffle at the door and
text: SCARLETT sprints inelegently into the room, runs towards
text: them and slips across the polished wooden floor, like on
dialog: ice.
scene_heading: 83.INT. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. EPTION. NIGHT. 83.
text: We see CHARLES, his face white, walking through the crowds
text: of people laughing. HAMISH still talking in the
dialog: background...
speaker_heading: HAMISH
dialog: I looked in the mirror this morning
dialog: when I was shaving, and I thought to
dialog: myself - I must learn to shave
text: without looking in the mirror.
dialog: However - if as the years go by I
dialog: can look in the mirror and see my
dialog: beautiful bride behind me - then
dialog: I'll put up with anything...
text: CHARLES sees MATTHEW and walks towards him. Just before he
text: reaches him, he hesitates - it's a hard moment.
dialog: 
dialog: 93
scene_heading: 84. INT. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT. 84.
text: The tableau in the other room.
scene_heading: 85. INT. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. REC: ON. NIGHT. 5.
text: The end of CHARLES'S hesitation. He moves forward, takes
text: MATTHEW's arm, and whispers in his ear.
text: CUT AWAY as we take in MATTHEW's reaction to the news.
scene_heading: 86. EXT. LAKE DISTRICT. DAY. 86.
text: Dramatic shots of the Lake District, in all its ill-
text: tempered winter beauty. After 30 seconds, we see CHARLES'
text: car driving. It turns the corner.
scene_heading: 87. EXT. FUNERA: CH. LAKE DISTRICT. DAY. 87.
text: There, in the middle of the mountains, stands a rough stone
text: chapel. Outside it are parked lots of cars. CHARLES is
text: last again. SCARLETT and he both get out and walk swiftly.
text: SCARLETT is dressed all in black, except for pink shoes.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: So: I' os
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't worry. We told you the wrong
text: time. It starts _in ten minutes.
dialog: You're early.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Thanks. Tom. Good to see you.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Wonderful to see you, Charles, as
dialog: always. Darling Scarlett.
text: SCARLETT's face just creases with sorrow. TOM seems to
text: have changed into a slightly different figure, still
dialog: foolish, but a good member of the community.
scene_heading: 88. INT. FUNERAL CHURCH. LAKE DISTRICT. DAY. 88.
text: They all walk in together. CHARLES sees MATTHEW.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm sorry I'm late.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Not at all - Gareth would have been
dialog: deeply wounded if you'd broken a
dialog: lifetime's tradition.
dialog: 
dialog: , 94
text: CHARLES moves past many faces we recognise: ANGUS, LYDIA,
text: BERNARD, LAURA and more. We also see some older people.
text: University colleagues - and two slightly meek, older
text: people, understood to be Gareth's parents.
text: CHARLES sees that CARRIE is there, in the far corner of the
text: church. She looks plain, un-made up - a beautiful but
text: rather startling contrast to the high flush of her wedding
text: day. But CHARLES sits where TOM gently guides him, next to
text: FIONA. DAVID slips in next to him...
text: Music begins to play. The service begins. The coffin is
text: there, in the middle of the aisle. The music comes to an
text: end. The local PRIEST speaks. .
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Before I begin, I have asked Matthew
dialog: to say a few words.
text: MATTHEW steps forward. He has a few papers.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Gareth used to prefer funerals to
dialog: weddings. He said it was easier to
dialog: get enthusiastic about a ceremony
dialog: one at least had an outside chance
dialog: of eventually being involved in.
text: Everyone laughs, they are immediately at ease. CHARLES
text: discreetly signs MATTHEW'S words for DAVID.
dialog: In order to do my research for this
dialog: speech I rang round to get a general
dialog: picture of how Gareth was regarded
dialog: by those who met him. "Fat" seems
dialog: to be a word people most connected
dialog: with him. I rang a couple of
dialog: libraries and asked if they
dialog: remembered him. "No." - "He was
dialog: fat..." - "O yes, of course!".
dialog: "Terribly rude" also rang a lot of
dialog: bells. When I told the emotional
dialog: Italian in our local sandwich shop
dialog: that Gareth was dead, his first
dialog: reaction was "Thank God for that" —
text: before, of course, bursting into
text: tears and closing the shop to mourn.
dialog: So, "very rude and very fat" seems
dialog: to have been the stranger's
dialog: viewpoint. And I'm sure the maker
dialog: of his waistcoats would like me to
dialog: add "very demanding and, of course,
dialog: quite mad".
dialog: On the other hand, some of you have
dialog: been kind enough to ring me, and
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95
speaker_heading: MATTHEW (cont'd)
dialog: tell me that you loved him - which
dialog: I know he would have been thrilled
dialog: to hear. Your remember his fabulous
dialog: hospitality and his strange,
dialog: experimental cooking - the recipe
dialog: for Duck a la Banana fortunately
text: goes with him to his grave. Most of
dialog: all, you tell me of his enormous
dialog: capacity for joy, and when joyful,
dialog: for highly vocal drunkenness. His
dialog: full bass version of "Shaddupa Ya
dialog: Face" is something we will all,
dialog: tragically, never forget. But I
dialog: hope joyful is how you will remember
dialog: hin. Not stuck in a box in a
dialog: church. Pick your favourite of his
text: waistcoats and then remember him
dialog: that way: the most splendid,
text: replete, gaudily dressed, weak-
dialog: hearted as it turned out, and jolly
dialog: bugger most of us ever met.
dialog: As for me, you may ask how I will
dialog: remember him, what I thought of hin,
dialog: and, ‘unfortunately, there I fall
dialog: rather short of words. Perhaps
dialog: you'll forgive me if I turn for ny
dialog: own feelings to the words of another
dialog: splendid bugger, W.H.Auden...
text: He recites a poem by Auden. At first he modestly reads it,
text: and then looks up and speaks it, not consulting the paper
text: in front of him.
dialog: Cut aways during the poem should include
dialog: GARETH'S parents - it would be nice to feel they understand
speaker_heading: MATTHEW.
dialog: This is actually what I want to say:
dialog: "Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone.
text: Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone.
text: Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
text: Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.
text: Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
text: Scribbling on the sky the message He is Dead,
text: Put the crepe bows round the white necks of the public
dialog: doves,
text: Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.
dialog: He was my North, my South, my East and West
dialog: My working week and my Sunday rest
dialog: My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song,
dialog: I thought that love would last for ever:
dialog: I was wrong.
dialog: The stars are not wanted now: put out every one
dialog: 
dialog: 96
speaker_heading: MATTHEW (cont 'd)
dialog: Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun
dialog: Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood
dialog: For nothing now can ever come to any good".
text: A long silence as MATTHEW folds his piece of paper. As he
text: goes and sits down, a little child cries out, fed up.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Quite right.
text: CUT TO FIONA reading the lesson.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: If I speak with the tongues of men
dialog: and angels, but have not love, I am
dialog: become a sounding brass, or a
dialog: clanging cymbal. And if I have the
dialog: gift of prophecy, and know all
dialog: mysteries and all knowledge; and if
dialog: I have all faith, so as to remove
dialog: mountains, but have not love - I am
dialog: nothing.
text: CUT TO CHARLES translating the last sentence for DAVID.
text: They both know how true it is.
scene_heading: 89 -_FUN: CHURCH. DISTRICT. DAY. 89.
text: People are kissing and getting back into their cars. DAVID
text: leaves CHARLES and walks away with SERENA. SCARLETT comes
text: up to CHARLES.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: I'm going back with David.
text: CHARLES nods. As SCARLETT walks away, she comes across
text: FIONA, who puts her arm over SCARLETT'S shoulder. Then
text: SCARLETT slips an arm round FIONA'S waist. It is the first
dialog: time we've seen them affectionate.
text: CARRIE approaches CHARLES...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It was good of you to come - must
dialog: have been the shortest honeymoon in
dialog: history.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No, it's fine. We're going to take
dialog: it some other time.
dialog: Pause: there are things to say.
dialog: That thing you said in the street...
dialog: 
dialog: 97
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I'm sorry about that - it was the
dialog: tea,... tea always.. - it's like LSD
dialog: with me, I don't know what I'm
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No - I liked it. I liked you saying
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Well, likewise your speech - I'll
dialog: hold you to it.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Okay.
dialog: Long pause.
dialog: I'd better be going.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes. . Bye.
text: He puts out his hand - to shake — but she comes forward and
text: kisses him - it is awkward like two uncomfortable lovers...
text: Then she walks away.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Walk, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes. That would be lovely.

dialog: Yes - yes - it's a strange thing
dialog: when at last it happens.
text: He looks at her with truth - without irony - then shakes
text: his head.
dialog: What about you, Fifi - when are you
dialog: going to show your cards?
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: O, really they're there for all to

dialog: same bloke for ages.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Who's that?
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: (Very casually) You, Charles. It's
dialog: always been you, since first we met,

text: He is sad, perplexed. She takes a puff on her cigarette.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: I knew the first. moment. Across the
text: crowded room - or lawn, in fact.
text: Pause for another puff.
dialog: Doesn't matter. Nothing either of
dialog: us can do on this one. Such is
dialog: life.
text: She looks straight at him. She's calm, glad to have said
text: it. He looks out, still confused. Then turns and looks at
text: her thoughtfully - she is calmly surveying the scene ahead.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: "Friends" isn't bad, you know.
dialog: Friends is quite something.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes...So what do we do? Let our
dialog: parents decide who we should marry?
dialog: Take the first girl and boy coming
dialog: over the hill?
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: No, but perhaps, you know, change
dialog: the goalposts - look for something
dialog: different - look for someone we can
dialog: live with, rather than someone we
dialog: adore.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hello, you chaps. Not butting in am
dialog: I?
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: (Almost tenderly) No, come on, Tom.

dialog: Gosh, that was some display, wasn't

speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Labrador.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: In a way I think it's hardest for
dialog: the parents, don't you? I hope I
dialog: die before ny children.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Tom - one thing I find really
dialog: touching is your total confidence
dialog: you will get married. What if you
dialog: never find the right girl?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well I don't know, Charlie, truth is
dialog: - unlike you, I've never expected
dialog: the thunderbolt - always hoped I'd
dialog: just meet some nice, friendly girl,
dialog: like the look of her, hope the look
dialog: of me doesn't make her physically
dialog: sick - then pop the question and
dialog: settle down and be happy.
text: CHARLES and FIONA exchange a look - maybe he's right.
dialog: It worked for my parents..well,
dialog: apart from the divorce and all that.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Dear Tom, you're very wise. I give

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Shame.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: I for one had totally given up on

dialog: some equally desperate ex, and make

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Your honour I object.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Either that - or he'd marry someone

text: brother. While the boys gather, with SCARLETT, who has
text: actually dressed in tails, FIONA arrives.
speaker_heading: FIONA
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Fifi.
dialog: They have been through their own war.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: You see that I am wearing black.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: O yes, so you are.
dialog: 
dialog: 106
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: But tomorrow, I'll be all the
dialog: colours of the rainbow. Think I'll
dialog: go find someone who fancies me for
dialog: a change.
text: She smiles - it is all right. TOM approaches in his formal
dialog: capacity.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Right, let's get going. Fiona,
dialog: bride or groom?
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: O fuck off, Thomas.
dialog: CUT TO: 5 minutes later
text: The guests are starting to arrive. SCARLETT stands next to

text: American - she rushes up to him, and jumps up, with her
text: legs around his waist.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Unusual behaviour for an usher.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ANGUS and LAURA from the first wedding arriving with twins.
text: Followed by LYDIA and. BERNARD.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (To Angus)
dialog: I had no idea!
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: Neither did bloody I - for heaven's
dialog: sake - it's ridiculous.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: O ignore him - he adores them - you
dialog: should see him with them in the
dialog: bath.
text: Behind her back, ANGUS mimes a drowning motion.
speaker_heading: ANGUS
dialog: (whispering as he passes)
dialog: The thing is to make it look like an
dialog: accident.
text: They keep arriving.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: We've got a lovely gift for you.
dialog: 
dialog: 107
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Can't wait. As long as it isn't
dialog: another salad bowl, T'll be
dialog: thrilled.
text: They both laugh very naturally at this. CHARLES moves
text: away. Their faces fall in grief.
speaker_heading: LYDIA
dialog: Honestly Bernard! (imitating her
dialog: husband) "He always loved salad!"

text: MATTHEW with CHARLES's mad OLD MAN.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Bride or groom?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: It should be perfectly obvious that
dialog: I'm neither.
dialog: MATTHEW is sweetly tolerant.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: If you'd like to sit here, sir.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
text: Anywhere I can see the screen.

speaker_heading: DEIRDRE
dialog: Bride.
text: He looks at her - it is love at first sight.
dialog: 
dialog: 108
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Ahm, yes. Fine. You know, I've got
dialog: a feeling we've met before.
speaker_heading: DEIRDRE
dialog: We have - about 25 years ago. I'm
dialog: second cousin Harold's daughter,
dialog: Deirdre. You're Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Good lord. So you're family.
speaker_heading: DEIRDRE
dialog: Yes.
text: Love is in their eyes.
speaker_heading: DEIRDRE
text: But very distant.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well, yes, of course. You said you
dialog: were... ‘bride’.
speaker_heading: DEIRDRE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yes. Well, do sit, do sit here,

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: You look lovely: but then, as you
dialog: know, I always liked you in wedding
dialog: gear.
speaker_heading: CHARLES smiles
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: And on time.
dialog: 109
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It's an extraordinary thing.
text: She smiles. So does he. They're happy with this.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: How's Hamish?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: O he's fine...I believe.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: You believe?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Yes. (pause) Wasn't the man for me
dialog: after all.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (worried)
dialog: You left him?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: We left each other. It was
dialog: charming. Very polite. Fine (she's
dialog: just a little precarious now)
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: O, a year or so. Yes. March was
dialog: hell. By April it was sorted.
dialog: (trying to make light of it) That's
dialog: absolutely the last time I. marry
dialog: someone twice my father's age.
dialog: MATTHEW interrupting - it's all go.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Time to travel, Charles...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (distracted) Yes, yes... (then
dialog: polite) Coming, good. (To Carrie)
dialog: Why didn't you get in touch with me?
speaker_heading: | CARRIE
dialog: i Well, you know, I did think about
dialog: it. Wanted to... but I was in a
dialog: state...
text: She clearly has remembered him intensely. But she gathers
dialog: herself.
dialog: . 110
speaker_heading: CARRIE (cont)
dialog: ...-Then I heard about this - so I
dialog: thought better not. (And now she's
dialog: breezy again) Anyway, mustn't hold
dialog: you up - see you afterwards - though
dialog: I fear that once again, we'll have
dialog: to break our lovely tradition.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes, fine, excellent.
text: She smiles and walks away. CHARLES is stunned.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No...
dialog: He may be about to say something very important - but no...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: .-.-let me show you to your seat...
dialog: (passing Matthew) I'm just showing
text: her to her seat.
text: They walk along in silence for a few seconds, down the
text: aisle. They reach the end of the pew - then, just before
dialog: turning into it:
speaker_heading: CHARLES (cont)
dialog: You probably should have = rung.
dialog: Despite what you heard. .
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Should I?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes. Yes, you should.
text: This is a restatement of his love for her.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Our timing really has been bad,
dialog: hasn't it?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It's been bad.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: It's been a disaster. (She loves him
dialog: too)
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It has, as you say, been very bad
dialog: indeed. God, it's lovely to see
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: PAUSE
dialog: 
dialog: 111
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Thank you. Good luck. It's pretty
dialog: easy - just say 'I do' whenever
dialog: anyone asks you a question.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Thanks.
text: CHARLES walks away and meets MATTHEW.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Shall we leave the ushing to the
dialog: ushers and take our positions up
dialog: front.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes - look, just give me a second
dialog: will you, Matthew?
dialog: ..-It's clearly not all over.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Certainly, freshen up at will.
scene_heading: 102. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. CORRIDOR. DAY. 102.
text: He walks down a corridor in this big church - and opens a
text: door - there are the choir, all warming up...
speaker_heading: CHOIR .
dialog: Love Divine, All Loves Excelling!!!
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Sorry.
text: He heads out and goes in the next door. It is two nuns,
text: who look at him angrily.
text: He goes back into the corridor.
scene_heading: 103. INT. WEDDING 4. C) C! VESTRY. DAY. 103.
text: Then he enters the next room. It is a big, beautiful,
text: empty ecclesiastical room. He goes in and shuts the door.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Dear Lord - I ask you to forgive me
dialog: for what I am about to say in this
dialog: magnificent place of worship.
dialog: Bugger! Bugger! Bugger! Bugger!
dialog: Bugger!
text: After each 'bugger', cut to another slightly surprised
text: looking religious icon - The Virgin Mary, The Crucifix, and
dialog: a final one which should be exceptionally angry,
text: disapproving, or is a man being pricked by forks in hell.
dialog: 
dialog: 112
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Bugger!
text: A very sweet-natured verger pops his head out from behind
text: a curtain where he has been washing his hands.
speaker_heading: VERGER
dialog: Can I help at all?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No thanks. No, no, fine, just
text: letting off some steam.
speaker_heading: VERGER
dialog: Excellent - often do the same myself
dialog: - not exactly the same vocabulary
dialog: obviously. Rather more 'blasts' and
dialog: ‘bothers'. I'll leave you.
scene_heading: 104. INT. WEDDING 4. C! - 04.
text: GUESTS arriving. Now down to the last seats. SCARLETT
text: guides someone into a position right flat totally behind a
dialog: pillar.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It's not as bad as it looks, if you
dialog: bend a little. (It's a lie).
text: Panning across we glimpse CARRIE, looking sérious. A tadge
text: vulnerable, with no idea what is going on.
dialog: cut To:
dialog: The door of the Church
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
text: The bride is arriving.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: 0 fabulous.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Only: one problem, we've lost the

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Ah...
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Stall her - I'll go find him.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Roger. Wilko.
dialog: 113
text: A tiny pause - then he thinks up a brilliant plan, and goes
dialog: on.
scene_heading: 105.INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. CORRIDOR. DAY. 05.
text: MATTHEW heading down the corridor, opening the same series
text: of doors - interrupting the same things. In the first
speaker_heading: room, THE CHOIR
speaker_heading: CHOIR
dialog: Lord of all peacefulness, Lord of
dialog: all calm!
text: Then, in the next room, the nuns.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: NUN
dialog: O, for Heaven's sake, Harriet, it's
dialog: like Piccadilly Circus round here.
scene_heading: 106. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. VESTRY AY. 106.
text: Then MATTHEW reaches the third room and there is CHARLES -
text: lying on an ancient grave in an alcove.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: (totally calm)
dialog: Ah, Charles, good to see you.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Hello Matthew. What was the name of
dialog: that low budget sci-fi film, 1980's,
dialog: where the hero had a watch which
dialog: sort of slowed down time - so he
dialog: could run around at real _ speed,
dialog: while everyone else was in slow
dialog: motion.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: O yes, I remember. Damn - yes.
dialog: Good film.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Very good film.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Not "The Hidden"?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No. One word title..."Trancers",
dialog: that was it.
dialog: . 114
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: That's it - that's the _ baby.
dialog: Excellent film. What about it?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Well, you haven't got one of those
dialog: watches have you?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Not actually on me at the moment.
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I need time to think.
scene_heading: 107. EXT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. DAY. 107.

scene_heading: 108. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. VESTRY. DAY. 108.
text: CHARLES and MATTHEW in the Vestry
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: It's just...what do you think about
dialog: marriage?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Excellent - if you love the ‘person.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Well quite. All these weddings -
dialog: all these years + here I am on my
dialog: own wedding day, and I'n
dialog: still....thinking.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Can I ask what about?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No, I think best not.
scene_heading: 109. EXT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. DAY. 109.
text: TOM heading off HENRIETTA and her FATHER
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yes, I'm terribly sorry - we've got
dialog: a bit of a delay: there's just a
dialog: slight problem with the flowers.
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: The flowers?
dialog: 
dialog: 115
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well, yes. Unfortunately we seem to
dialog: have quite a few hay-fever sufferers
dialog: in the congregation, and they've
dialog: been stuck next to the damn flowers,
dialog: so we're just moving them - the
dialog: congregation, not the flowers - but
dialog: anyway, with any luck, it will be
dialog: all right in a jiffy, I'm absolutely
dialog: convinced. I'll report back
dialog: pronto...
text: He rushes back into the Church. HENRIETTA raises her eyes
dialog: sceptically - this chaos is rather what she expected of
text: Tom's ushering.
scene_heading: 110. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. DAY. 10.
text: TOM reaches MATTHEW and DAVID.
speaker_heading: . MATTHEW
dialog: How are you doing?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I think I've fooled them so far.
dialog: The great advantage of having a
dialog: reputation for being stupid - people
dialog: are less suspicious of you. What's
dialog: happening?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: We'll have to wait and see. He's
text: along the corridor. He's thinking.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What about?
scene_heading: 111. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. VESTRY. DAY. 111.
text: There is a knock on the door.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Enter.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Ah - Charles - we wondered if we
dialog: could lend a hand.
text: MATTHEW, TOM, DAVID enter. CHARLES smiles. SCARLETT
text: sneaks in behind.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What's the problem, Charlie?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's the problem?
dialog: 
dialog: 116
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: oO, look, it's really
dialog: nothing... (simultaneously to
dialog: David)... I'm fucked.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Charles...(really concerned)... no
dialog: matter what it is, you can tell
dialog: us...you really can...
text: He looks at them - they are waiting to help him - he is
text: about to speak, when suddenly there is a knock on the door
dialog: - they're all terrified - 'Is it the bride?' is the basic
dialog: fear.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: The VICAR enters
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: Hello. Thought I'd come in and
dialog: shove on the gear. You chaps having
dialog: a final smoke, are you, before the
dialog: proceedings?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Yes, sort of spiritually speaking.
speaker_heading: VICAR :
dialog: Well, don't be too long - the
dialog: bride'll think you don't want to
dialog: marry her.
text: They exchange glances - at the last moment, defeated by
text: politeness and etiquette. The VICAR talks away, while
text: CHARLES signs to DAVID.. :
speaker_heading: VICAR (V/O CHARLES & DAVID's conversation)
dialog: Seeing you all in here reminds me of
dialog: a terrible time, I had a groom who
dialog: had rather overdone it with the
dialog: alcohol the day before, and found he
dialog: couldn't help throwing up into the
dialog: font. Problem was, no-one knew, and
dialog: the next Saturday, someone rather
dialog: carelessly filled it up with water
dialog: for a Christening without checking
dialog: inside. No wonder the poor blighter
dialog: cried when he got dunked.
text: What we're watching is CHARLES talking to DAVID...
speaker_heading: . DAVID
dialog: Give me an update.
dialog: 
dialog: They
dialog: 112.
dialog: 117
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: This is _so embarrassing...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I_was with you the day you wet
dialog: yourself during the school Carol
dialog: service.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I__just saw __ Carrie and she's
text: separated and it suddenly reminded
dialog: me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: QJesus. Charlie, it's your wedding
dialog: day...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I_know...What's your advice?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: 3 choices: go ahead with it...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Go outside and say, "folks, bad news
dialog: it's all off"...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Not tempting...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And...I_ can't think of a third...
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: Well, togs on - are we all ready to
dialog: face the enemy?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Are we?
text: all look at CHARLES.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yes. Excellent.
scene_heading: INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. CORRIDOR. DAY. 112.
text: Outside the door of the vestry - the most emotional music
dialog: plays.
text: The door opens. They are all standing there -
text: trim, smiling, ready.
dialog: 
dialog: . . 118
scene_heading: 113. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. DAY. 113.
text: CHARLES walks along to the top of the aisle with MATTHEW.
text: Meanwhile, at the back...
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: What was that about?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Buggered if I know.
text: As CHARLES looks forward, the light breaks through the
text: stained glass windows on to CARRIE. He looks at her, and
text: walks on, up the aisle to his fate.
text: MATTHEW checks in his pocket for the rings. He pretends to
text: have lost them - them remembers they're in his back pocket,
text: with a great show of mock relief. He turns. TOM is at the
text: front door and gives him a thumbs up - everything is A.O.K.
dialog: for action.
text: The Wedding march starts.
text: CUT TO HENRIETTA, walking down the aisle - she looks
text: beautiful. Her father by her side, holding her arn.
speaker_heading: HENRIETTA
dialog: Not so tight.
text: She arrives. The PRIEST steps forward. CHARLES smiles at
dialog: hin.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: Dearly beloved. We are gathered
dialog: here together in the sight of God
dialog: and in the face of this congregation
dialog: to join together this man and this
dialog: woman in holy Matrimony -
text: CUT TO SCARLETT absolutely totally beaming with pride - and
text: probably crying already.
speaker_heading: VICAR (cont'd)
dialog: which is an honourable estate,
dialog: instituted of God in the time of
dialog: man's innocence, signifying unto us
dialog: the mystical union that is betwixt
dialog: Christ and his Church...
text: CUT TO ANGUS and LAURA
dialog: and therefore is not by any to be
dialog: enterprised, nor taken in hand
text: unadvisedly, lightly or wantonly
dialog: 119
text: CUT TO BERNARD and LYDIA
text: But reverently, discreetly,
text: advisedly, soberly, and in the fear
dialog: of God. Therefore, if any man can
dialog: show any just cause why they may not
dialog: lawfully be joined together, let him
dialog: speak now, or else hereafter for
dialog: ever hold his peace.
text: The usual pause. Settle on CHARLES. And then there is a
text: knocking from behind, knuckles on wood.
text: CHARLES looks startled. The BRIDE looks to him alarmed.
text: So does MATTHEW.
dialog: CUT TO DAVID,
speaker_heading: CHARLES.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: I'm sorry - does someone have
dialog: something to say?
text: who raises his hand. CUT between him and
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I think he might. (He starts to
dialog: sign) What in the name of...
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you translate?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Tra: te what?
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Ahm, he's asking me if I'll
dialog: translate what he's saying.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: O excellent. What is he saying?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: He says...( and he watches David)
dialog: ‘I suspect the groom is having doubts: I
dialog: suspect the groom would like to delay. I
dialog: suspect the groom... I suspect the groom..
dialog: 120
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: -..rea loves someone ___else
dialog: That's the truth, isn't it Charlie?
text: CHARLES doesn't sign back.
speaker_heading: DAVID (cont)
dialog: Because, Charlie - this is for the
dialog: rest of your life - in the end, if
dialog: you_marry at all - you've got to
dialog: Marry the person you totally love.
text: CUT TO: CHARLES and then DAVID again.
speaker_heading: DAVID (cont)
dialog: And_by the way - your flies are
text: undone.
text: CHARLES just does a tiny look down
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: What's he saying?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: He says, he suspects that the groom
dialog: loves someone else.
speaker_heading: VICAR
dialog: And do you? (Pause) Do you love
dialog: someone else? (Pause) Do you
dialog: Charles?
speaker_heading: PAUSE
scene_heading: CUT ROUND: Everyone - SCARLETT, TOM, HENRIETTA, FIONA, THE
text: FATHER OF THE BRIDE. Then like someone saying his vows...
speaker_heading: CHARLES |
dialog: I do.
text: The camera holds on CHARLES and then moves slowly high up
dialog: into the Church.
scene_heading: 4. NT. KITCHEN. CHARLES & SCARLETT'S HOUSE. NIGHT.114.
text: Same set up as at breakfast, only 10 hours later. The
text: champagne bottle is still lying there. CHARLES, FIONA,
text: SCARLETT, DAVID, TOM, MATTHEW. Total silence. They're in
dialog: shock about what happened in church.
dialog: More silence.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: Blimey.
dialog: Pause
speaker_heading: 1221
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (optimistically)
dialog: At least it's one we won't forget.
dialog: I mean a lot of weddings just blend
dialog: into each other, don't they, but
dialog: this is one that will really stick
text: out in the memory.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: For not actually including a wedding
dialog: service.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well, that amongst other things.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm not surprised he hit you.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: (who has a black eye)
dialog: No, I think it was the right thing
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: FIONA
dialog: Poor girl.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: O God.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Though, let's face facts - I ‘mean if
dialog: you weren't sure you wanted to marry
dialog: her today of all days, i.e. your
dialog: wedding day, it must be the right
dialog: decision, mustn't it?
text: FIONA turns to him to deliver her usual 'Fuck off Tom' -
text: then just brushes his cheek affectionately.
speaker_heading: DAVID speaks
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: None of you happened to see...no,
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: SCARLETT
dialog: It was a lovely dress though, wasn't
dialog: it. (little pause) I'm sure she'll
dialog: find it useful for parties.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I blame myself.
dialog: : 122
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: (simultaneously)
dialog: No absolutely not/ No, you did the
dialog: right thing/No, you mustn't/ On the
dialog: contrary, you're the hero...
text: CHARLES looks up at him
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: They all blame you too.
text: PAUSE. A doorbell rings. They all get up, all relieved to
dialog: have an excuse to move.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: (simultaneously)
dialog: I'll get it.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: No, let me. If there's music to
dialog: face, I should be facing it...
text: He goes downstairs, gathers his strength and opens the
text: door. It is CARRIE. Full romance in the look and music of
dialog: the moment.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: . ‘ CHARLES
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: PAUSE
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Tell me, what was that about this

text: CHARLES shakes his head and looks up.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: eee. YOu.
speaker_heading: PAUSE
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: Good...although a disaster.
speaker_heading: CHARLES
text: Unspeakably disastrous.
text: They look hard at each other and then can't resist a gentle
dialog: smile.
dialog: 123
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Come on in - it's raining...
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No - let's stay out...
text: Smiling, remembering the rain conversation
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Okay...
scene_heading: 115. EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE. NIGHT. 115.
text: They stroll for a moment - then stop.
speaker_heading: CHARLES (cont)
dialog: I want to ask you a question - a
dialog: huge question, an important
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Okay - what is it?
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Do you think, in time, you might
dialog: possible agree....never to marry me?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I do.
text: They kiss in the rain.
speaker_heading: THE END.
