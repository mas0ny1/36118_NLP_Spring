dialog: Use an old fork to cut your mix.

text: The same hand goes through a boy’s closet. The clothes are

scene_heading: INT. PRICEMART - DAY 18

scene_heading: INT. MAGAZINE RACK, PRICEMART - DAY 20
text: Henry walks past the ADULT MAGAZINES, just slow enough to

text: He slows down again at the women’s magazines. COVER OF COSMO:
dialog: What Women Wish Men Knew That They Don't.
text: Henry reaches for one when he is bumped by a middle aged
text: woman. Henry flinches and moves on to the COMICS RACK.
text: He spins the turnstile of superheroes. We’re following his
text: gaze down past caped crusaders when we find a pair of MEN’S
text: SHOES. They’re worn in and muddy. Upon closer glance, one is
text: stained with FRESH BLOOD, trailing from the man’s ankle.
text: Henry looks up following the legs and torso until he is
text: staring up at FRANK. He is the illustration in a biology
dialog: book, for a page they’d label Man.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wonder if you could give me a hand
dialog: here.
text: Frank is wearing a RED PRICEMART VEST. Henry notices blood

text: Frank nods at Adele, who is just leaving Boys’ Clothes Dept.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: My mom.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What I wanted to ask is, if you
dialog: think she'd give me a ride.
text: We see Henry’s gears turning. Frank takes an awkward step
text: forward and places a firm grip on Henry’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
text: She looks like the type of person
dialog: who would help me.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: He was right. That’s exactly the
dialog: type my mom was.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Frank and Henry are walking with purpose in Adele’s
text: direction. Frank is trying not to limp. He grabs a BALLCAP,
text: quickly yanks off the tag and puts it on his head. Henry
text: notices but doesn’t say a word.
text: They turn a corner. Off comes the Red Pricemart Vest. Frank
text: grabs a FLEECE and quickly throws it on.
scene_heading: INT. HARDWARE DEPT, PRICEMART - DAY 21
text: Adele is analyzing LIGHT BULBS. Frank and Henry walk up.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: This is my mother Adele. Mom, this

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You have a good boy here, Adele. He
dialog: was kind enough to offer me a ride.
dialog: 22
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Oh, well... um. He may have... We
dialog: have a big afternoon. I don’t think
dialog: we can help you.
text: Frank reaches into his pocket and pulls out a baseball.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Henry)
dialog: Shame. Thought we could have a
dialog: catch.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I suck at baseball.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe you used to.
dialog: (fingering the stitches)
dialog: Throw around the ball with your
dialog: dad?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I only see him on Sundays...
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (cuts Henry off)
dialog: I’m sorry, but we really can’t help
dialog: you.
text: For a moment, Frank clenches his teeth in pain. Then, he
text: MOVES HIS HAND to the back of Henry’s neck. It’s hard to
text: interpret whether it’s a gesture of kindness or a threat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Adele)
dialog: (Frankly), this needs to happen.
text: Adele looks deeply into Frank's eyes. She makes a decision.
scene_heading: INT. CHECKOUT, PRICEMART - DAY 22
text: Adele's items are rung up. A bomb shelter’s worth of canned
text: goods go by, beep, beep, beep, beep... Frank shows curiosity
text: at the sheer amount. He then adds the baseball and mitt to
dialog: the checkstand.
text: Adele makes eye contact with the CHECKER. There’s a moment
text: where she could say something. She considers asking for help.
text: She doesn’t.
scene_heading: 23 EXT. PARKING LOT, PRICEMART - DAY 23

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (cautious)
dialog: Okay.
text: Henry enters the rear passenger door and slides over. Frank
text: sits down next to him and shuts the door.
text: Adele rounds the car, trying not to panic. She enters the
text: driver’s side door and takes a seat. Shuts the door. Silence.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Where do you want to go?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Your house.
text: Adele suppresses a reaction.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Just for a moment to rest my legs.
text: She looks back and sees her son sitting next to this
text: commanding and bloodied stranger. She turns the ignition.
scene_heading: 24 INT. ADELE’S STATION WAGON - DAY 24
text: Driving back through the suburbs. Strangely calm and quiet.
text: Just as they pull up to a stoplight, A POLICE CRUISER pulls
text: up on their left. Henry notices. His heart quickens. Frank
text: keeps his eyes straight, trying to act calm. Adele looks over
text: at the cops. She thinks for a second, then puts on her signal
text: and turns right, pulling away from the cruiser.
text: They catch a glimpse of each other in the mirror. A moment.
dialog: 25
dialog: 26

scene_heading: EXT. ADELE’S STREET - DAY 25
text: Adele's station wagon makes its way down the quiet cul-de-sac

text: and Henry with the groceries.
text: As they’re emptying the car, Henry can’t help but look back
text: at his neglected home, seeing it through the eyes of a
text: stranger for the first time in what’s obviously a while.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: Other than religious types or
dialog: someone with a petition, hardly
dialog: anyone ever came to see us. By this
dialog: point, my mom was down to basically
dialog: one friend and even Evelyn hardly
dialog: came by anymore.
text: Adele opens the front door. Henry goes to hold it for her,
text: but Frank already has an elbow on it. Smiles - Get inside.
scene_heading: INT. ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 26
text: Adele leads the grocery caravan into the kitchen. All the
text: while, Henry looks around, seeing what Frank is seeing.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: You'll have to excuse the mess,
dialog: we've been busy.
text: Henry glances at his mother confused.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)

text: We pan across POST IT NOTES with sharpie written Spanish

text: Adele positions herself near the KNIFE DRAWER.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (eyeing Frank cautiously)
dialog: How do you take your coffee?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: As is. Thank you, Adele.
text: Frank notices all the window sheers have been drawn. Thinks
text: on this for a second. He moves to the kitchen window and
text: looks out back - The backyard is an unkept mess of overgrown
text: grass leading to a thick woods. We hear the distant SOUND OF
text: A TRAIN’S WHISTLE.
text: He takes in the kitchen table - a foreign object. There’s a
text: silence. One that acknowledges that neither Adele or Frank
dialog: know how they’ve made it this far.
speaker_heading: HENRY

text: Frank weighs the question.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m going to be straight with you

dialog: I’m not going to lie.
dialog: (back to Henry)
dialog: I hurt my leg - my leg, and my head

dialog: at a hospital they’d taken me to
dialog: get my appendix out.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY ROOM, HOSPITAL - DAY 29
text: Frank lying in bed attached to an IV. A nurse sits at his
text: bedside, preparing an IV. The guard outside the door is
text: turned away. The look on the nurse’s face changes. She knows
dialog: what is about to happen.
text: In one move, Frank leaps out of the hospital bed, pulls the

text: catch Frank grab the top of the window sill and hurtle out
text: feet first.
scene_heading: INT. ADELE’S KITCHEN - DAY 30

scene_heading: INT. ADELE’S KITCHEN - DAY 32
text: Adele hands Frank his coffee. She seems to be taking in every

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'd be grateful if you let me stay
dialog: til nightfall. I’d try to help out.
dialog: Wouldn’t ask anything of you.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (cautious)
dialog: You just did.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nothing more than a place to lay
dialog: low and rest my leg for a few
dialog: hours.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: How do I know you won’t hurt us?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’ve never intentionally hurt
dialog: anyone in my life.
text: Adele considers this. We want to believe him. Henry observes
text: his mother carefully.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: You understand how that could be
dialog: hard to believe.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I do. How far are the train tracks

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Mom’s great. She’s learning to play
dialog: the cello.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: I just ask because I get the idea
text: her depression is getting worse.
text: A moment. Henry could reveal more, but he can tell his father
dialog: doesn’t actually want him to move in. He’s just trying to
dialog: do/say the right thing.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Mom takes care of me great. We do

text: ON TV: The head of highway patrol is interviewed.
scene_heading: HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
dialog: Considering his injuries, we
dialog: believe he hasn’t gotten far. Keep

text: Henry looks to Frank - Is he armed?
text: ON TV: Shot of the hospital that zooms in on a broken window.
speaker_heading: ANCHOR WOMAN
dialog: Chambers was recovering from
text: appendicitis on the second floor of
dialog: this hospital, when police say, he
dialog: just made a jump for it.
dialog: ON TV: Interview with the nurse.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: He whipped me around and next thing
dialog: I know, he was out the window.
speaker_heading: ANCHOR WOMAN
dialog: Authorities would like to remind
dialog: our viewers that this kind of leap
dialog: can spell desperation. Especially
dialog: in an inmate serving eighteen years
dialog: for murder.
text: The report ends and switches over to another story, but that
text: word hangs in the air. Murder.
text: Henry and Adele examine Frank’s face... Is it the face of a
text: killer? Frank doesn’t betray his calm demeanor.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It didn’t happen that way.
text: Adele and Henry are too nervous to push Frank on this point.

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Isn't it against the law to hide a

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You have a wise son here, Adele. Good
dialog: to know he’s looking out for you.
speaker_heading: ADELE
text: (trying to calm her son as
dialog: well as Frank)
dialog: It’s all going to be fine. It would
dialog: only be a problem if someone found
dialog: Frank here... And that doesn’t need
dialog: to happen. He can just lay low for
text: a few hours and then keep moving.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: True enough. But it’s still not
dialog: acceptable to place you and your
dialog: family here in jeopardy. If someone
dialog: were to come by, it would need to
dialog: look like I kidnapped you.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: That's why I’m going to tie you up.
text: Henry looks to his mother. Adele’s breath quickens.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)

dialog: It’s about keeping up appearances.
dialog: I think you understand what I mean.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (careful)

speaker_heading: FRANK

text: Henry eyes Frank cautiously.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 51
text: Adele leads Frank downstairs. It’s cluttered. Some nursery
text: items visible. She pulls out a box that contains a roll of
text: braided cord. Frank checks the strength. We can tell Adele’s
text: heart is beating faster. She reaches in her pocket for the
text: knife from the kitchen. We can see through the fabric of her
text: dress that she has it in her grasp, when...
dialog: 52
dialog: 53
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This’1l work.
text: He grabs the rope. Adele releases the knife and pulls her
text: hands from her pockets.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, ADELE’S HOUSE - SAME 52
text: Meanwhile, Henry has been left alone in the house.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
text: Across the street was Mr. Jervis’s
dialog: house. After that, the Farnsworths
dialog: and the Edwards. I could burst out
dialog: the door. I could grab the phone
text: and dial a number. The police. Four
text: steps to the front door and a good
dialog: shout. That’s all it would take.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 53
text: Frank checks a wooden chair for splinters before slowly
text: lowering Adele to a seat. He kneels down at each of her feet
text: and begins tying them tenderly to the legs of the chair.
text: Adele attempts a comforting look to Henry. Frank notices.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Henry)
dialog: I don’t want any of this to upset
dialog: you, son. There are just some
dialog: things a person has to do in these
dialog: types of situations.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Why don’t you go grab one of your
dialog: comic books.
text: Henry takes a beat and looks to his mother. She gives a
text: little nod and a reassuring smile. Henry reticently walks
text: away as Frank picks up Adele’s calf, admiring her foot.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Beauty.
text: Frank takes Adele’s thin pale wrists, first her left, then
text: her right, angling her elbows gently, as he draws them behind
text: the chair’s back and ties them together.
text: It’s dead silent. Quiet enough to hear the rough chord pull
text: into a tight little knot.
text: Frank steps in front of Adele and their eyes meet.

text: Henry has returned with a comic book, sitting in the next

text: boy's fear at the sight of his mother tied up.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You got a pantry?
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 54 *
text: Frank opens the basement door to find shelves of canned

dialog: else important from her.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, ADELE’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 56 *
text: Henry watches carefully as Frank makes quick moves at the
text: stove. He knows his way around a kitchen. For a moment Henry

speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Grab a bowl.
dialog: 57

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, ADELE’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 57
text: Henry takes his chili back into the living room and settles
text: in front of the TV - RED SOX GAME.
dialog: Takes a bite. It’s delicious.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: And he was right about the chili.
dialog: 23.
text: Frank sits down next to Adele at the kitchen table. He sets a
text: bowl in front of her and waves at it with his hand to cool.
text: Then brings a spoon to Adele’s lips.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: There was something about the way
dialog: Frank fed my mother...
text: Adele swallows the bite.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: You might think it was humiliating,
dialog: to sit there like that. If he put too
dialog: much on the spoon, or too little,
dialog: she'd simply have to take it.
text: Lifts the spoon. Blows on it. Brings it to Adele’s lips.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: But every spoonful, he made sure
dialog: was the right amount.
speaker_heading: ADELE (V.O.)

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It’s okay, they explained
dialog: everything in our health assembly.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: There is another aspect that your

scene_heading: EXT. RURAL ROAD - SUNDOWN 59
text: Frank's truck drives along. Mandy rides next to him.
speaker_heading: ADELE (V.O.)
text: There is another kind of hunger.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF A HILL - MAGIC HOUR 60

text: Mandy smiles and lies down. Frank climbs on top of her.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: Keep your belt on cowboy.
speaker_heading: ADELE (V.O.)
text: A hunger for human touch.
scene_heading: INT. ADELE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 61
text: Frank takes a napkin and dabs the corner of Adele’s mouth.
speaker_heading: ADELE (V.O.)
dialog: Desire. People never tell you about
text: how it feels. The longing.
text: A flood light washes across the windows. We see a cruiser
text: through the sheers pass by. Frank takes note.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What time do the trains start in
dialog: the morning?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just have to keep an ear out for

dialog: 66
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 63
text: Henry crawls up to his mother’s bedroom doorway to find her
text: asleep - her wrist tied to the bedpost. He then crawls his
text: way to the stairs until he has an angle on the living room.
text: He can see Frank’s boots resting on the arm of the sofa.
text: Henry inches forward until he can sees Frank’s legs...
text: Frank's torso... Frank’s neck... and then Frank’s face,
text: hidden in the shadows. It takes a moment for our vision to
text: adjust. We adjust the exposure until we can JUST see Frank’s
text: open eyes... staring back at us.
text: Henry’s breath quickens. Frank nods. Henry attempts to calm
text: himself before tip toeing back to bed.
scene_heading: INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING 64
text: Henry gets out of bed. Was last night a dream? He walks over
text: to his HAMSTER CAGE and feeds his pet, JOE. Then steps out.
scene_heading: INT. TOP OF STAIRS - SAME 65
text: Henry looks into his mother’s room. Adele is sleeping. One
text: wrist in evidence, still restrained to the bed post.
text: At the bottom of the stairs, he looks into the living room.
text: Evidence of Frank having slept the night on the couch.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, ADELE’S HOUSE - SAME 66
text: Henry looks around, but Frank is nowhere to be seen. The back
text: door is open. The sound of the cicadas whispers in. Henry
text: wonders for a moment... Is that it? Is he gone? We can tell
dialog: he kind of misses him when...
text: Frank emerges from the basement.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Couldn’t find any eggs.
text: Henry whips around as Frank steps over to the oven and opens
text: it. He’s made a makeshift splint out of a wooden spoon and a
text: dish rag. Frank strains as he removes a tray of biscuits from
text: the oven, his appendix scar staining his shirt.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: We don’t stock up much on
text: groceries. Mostly canned goods.
text: Henry walks passed the chair that Adele occupied the night
text: before, rope still tied to the legs.

dialog: Keep you in fresh eggs. Poultry.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 68
text: Henry goes to cut open the biscuit with a knife... Frank
text: quickly grabs the knife from his hand. For a moment, it seems
text: like a defensive move, but instead...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: Never slice a biscuit.
dialog: (tearing one open with his
dialog: hands)
dialog: You want to pull them apart, so you

scene_heading: 69A INT. DINING ROOM - DAY 69A
text: Frank notices Henry trying to eye the front of the NEWSPAPER.
text: It features the prison photo of Frank from TV.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don’t blame you for wondering. Just
dialog: know, there’s more to this story than
dialog: you'll see in that paper there.
text: Henry stops looking.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You got brothers or sisters?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: No, um, my mom tried but...
text: Frank takes this in without reacting.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve got a stepbrother and a half-
dialog: sister. My dad takes me out to
dialog: dinner with them on Sundays.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How does a fellow let a woman like
dialog: your mother get away?
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: He got together with his secretary.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Huh. Good riddance.
text: Henry works up the confidence to ask a question.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: How did you escape?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I told the guard at the hospital if
dialog: he left, I was going to jump out
dialog: the window. He heard that and went
dialog: to have a smoke. Nothing misleads
dialog: people like the truth.
speaker_heading: ADELE (0.C.)
dialog: Good morning.
text: Frank and Henry turn to see Adele enter the room.
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: What are those?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Biscuits. They’re amazing.
text: Henry’s joy for his breakfast makes Adele cautious.

text: Adele offers her wrists to Frank for binding.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don’t think we’ll be needing that
dialog: any longer. But if the day comes
dialog: when you have to say I tied you up,
dialog: you won’t be lying.
dialog: (another thought)
dialog: Haven't heard any trains go by.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Holiday weekend. Might be a funny
dialog: schedule.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (offering a biscuit)
dialog: Breakfast?
text: She wants to resist the invitation.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You have to try them.
text: Adele submits to the biscuit. Tries to suppress a smile.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 70
text: Henry puts on one of his mom’s folk records. There’s a warp
text: in the record from sun damage. We can even see the beam of
text: sunlight that must cut across the record player at times.
text: Music continues through the following short scenes.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 71
text: Frank brushes his teeth using a dish towel.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - DAY 72
text: Frank rolls the car into the garage. Later, we find Frank
text: under Adele’s car checking the breaks. Henry sits by,
text: watching with curiosity.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, Hank. Grab me the 3/4 socket
dialog: wrench.
text: Henry looks into the tool box. He doesn’t know a socket

text: embarrassed. Frank understands immediately. He points to the
text: side of the wrench that’s closed.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Socket wrench.
text: Frank disappears under the car.
text: Music comes up as we begin a quiet montage of Frank doing
text: chores around the house. Henry is by his side for everything.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: That day, Frank changed the oil in
text: the car and replaced a fuse for the

scene_heading: EXT. SIDE OF ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 74

text: Adele watches from a window.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Before you can throw a ball, you
dialog: need to know how to hold a ball...

dialog: 77
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You feel that?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 77
text: Frank sits at the kitchen table, his twisted ankle up on
text: another chair. Adele is hemming the ripped pant cuff, being
text: careful not to poke Frank with the needle.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Adele)
dialog: You bite your lip when you sew.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I’m trying not to stick you.

dialog: How'd you get this?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Stars and Stripes Forever routine
dialog: at my dance recital. Halfway

text: Frank touches the scar tenderly. Henry watches his mother
text: carefully. Everyone seems to have forgotten...
text: KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK! - A banging at the kitchen door that
text: leads to the side of the house. We see a SILHOUETTE of a man
text: in the window of the split kitchen door.
text: All three stop. We can almost see the vein in Frank’s neck
text: raise. His eyes go dead serious.
text: Henry looks - Frank is holding Adele’s wrist. Her hands shake.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Answer the door, Henry. Let‘em know

text: Frank pulls Henry in for a second.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)

scene_heading: KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!
dialog: 31.
text: Henry walks over to the kitchen door as Frank and Adele curl
text: behind a corner where they can’t be seen. Perhaps Frank
text: stands just out of sight, his hand holding the back of
text: Henry’s shirt as a reminder of his presence.
text: Henry opens the top half of the kitchen door, revealing his
text: neighbor MR. JERVIS. A friendly man in his 50's carrying a
text: BUCKET OF PEACHES. It’s clear that he has a thing for Adele.
speaker_heading: MR. JERVIS
dialog: Oh hi Henry, I was looking for your
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I’m sorry Mr. Jervis. She’s not home
dialog: right now.

speaker_heading: MR. JERVIS

dialog: Has she been following the news?
dialog: She leave you here by yourself?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I just mean she can’t come to the
text: door... She’s taking a bath.
speaker_heading: MR. JERVIS
dialog: Aaah...
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (re: the peaches)
dialog: Are those for her?
speaker_heading: MR. JERVIS
dialog: Yeah, got so many of these, didn’t
dialog: know what to do. Thought your mother
dialog: might like them.
text: Jervis hands Henry the peaches.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Thank you. I’m sure she’1ll

speaker_heading: MR. JERVIS
dialog: (not letting up)
dialog: Sure she’s not around? There’s
dialog: something I’d like to discuss with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Can I give her a message?
speaker_heading: MR. JERVIS
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Look, Henry, there’s some...
dialog: I’m not sure if you heard, but
dialog: there’s a guy loose - just broke
dialog: out of Stinchfield. He’s probably
text: long gone by now, but until they
dialog: find him, I just wouldn’t be
text: opening the door without an adult.
text: Henry measures his response.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Thank you for telling me.
dialog: (a thought)
dialog: What did he do?
speaker_heading: MR. JERVIS
dialog: Some pretty awful things, son.
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: He...
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MR. JERVIS
dialog: (immediately regrets
dialog: telling Henry)
dialog: Look, I doubt he’s anywhere near here
dialog: by now... Just remember, I’m right
dialog: across the street. You have any
dialog: problems, just give me a jingle.
text: Mr. Jervis exits and Henry closes the door.
text: Adele and Frank enter the room and size up the peaches.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (sets down the peaches)
dialog: He had more than he needed.
text: Frank senses Henry’s apprehension.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (pats him on the shoulder)
dialog: You did good, Hank.

speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Henry, why don’t you go check on Joe.
speaker_heading: HENRY

speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: You can’t do that again.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What did I...?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: My son is not your look out.

speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Not for a second.
dialog: (however)
dialog: There hasn’t been a man in this house
text: for a while now. I see how he looks at
dialog: you. What he wants. That encouragement -
dialog: a pat on his shoulder so badly. And I
dialog: want it for him. But not for that.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I can’t promise what’s going to
text: show up at the door.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (believe me)
dialog: I know.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay, then.
text: A look between the two of them resolves the conversation.
text: Frank grabs a peach, takes a bite.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Good peach. Too bad they’re all so

dialog: Thing was, when Frank threw the
dialog: ball, I caught it.
text: They continue to throw the ball back and forth.
scene_heading: INT. JERVIS’S HOUSE - SAME 116
text: Jervis looks out the window and something catches his eye.
text: From his angle, it appears that Henry is having a game of
text: catch with an unseen person behind the house. He sees Henry
text: in the backyard toss the ball. A moment later it is thrown
text: back, strong and true, by someone out of Jervis’s sight-line.
text: He frowns.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There it is. If I had a whole

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on. You know I won’t take no

text: Frank helps Adele up. He begins positioning her, almost like
text: a dancer. He’s behind her, forming his body to hers, ina
text: batter’s stance.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright Hank, bring us the heat.
text: Henry takes position. He throws the ball. Frank and Adele
text: swing the bat cracking the ball far. Barry yelps. They

speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)

text: something coarse about the way she kisses him.
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S BEDROOM - DAY 122
text: Mandy pushes Frank onto the bed. She’s down at his feet
text: taking off his boots.
speaker_heading: MANDY
dialog: I bet you’ve been starved for this,
dialog: right, baby? Or all you got was
dialog: yellow girls?
text: Frank is caught up in the momentum but we can tell things are
text: moving a little fast for him. Mandy rides Frank in an
text: uncomfortable bit of love making. She seems on a mission.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, ADELE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 127
text: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is on TV. The group watches, exhausted from
text: the day. Henry practices his new grip of the baseball.
text: Frank enters with a cold washcloth and pats Barry’s forehead.
text: Then the back of his neck. It’s an incredibly tender act that
text: has as much effect on Adele and Henry as it does on Barry.
dialog: 54.
text: The movie fades out and a teaser for the LATE NEWS comes up.
speaker_heading: ANCHOR WOMAN 2
dialog: Tonight at llpm, more on escaped

text: A commercial comes up. The room gets quiet.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I may not be innocent but I am not
dialog: a murderer.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (wants to believe)
dialog: The man I’ve met doesn’t seem
dialog: capable.
text: Adele looks deep into Frank’s eyes. Their bond is so strong
text: that Henry doesn’t dare move or make a sound. They could stay
text: like this all night, but HEADLIGHTS cut across the window.
text: They look outside to see Evelyn’s station wagon pull up
text: outside. Without a word, Frank begins up the stairs.
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, Barry, looks like your
dialog: mother is here.
text: Adele opens the front door as Evelyn makes her way in.
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: How’s your father?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: It’s complicated and not all good,
text: but he’s under supervision.
dialog: (Uses her Barry voice)
dialog: Did you have a good time today?
text: Barry coos.
text: The TV turns to a NEWS UPDATE. It’s a report on Frank.
speaker_heading: ANCHOR WOMAN 2
dialog: No further luck in finding escaped
dialog: prisoner Frank Chambers today...
text: The news piece continues. Adele and Henry try not to change
text: their demeanor. Barry is profile to the TV and hasn’t noticed
text: Frank’s photo.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (pushing them to leave)
dialog: Well, we’ve had a busy day...
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I’ve been on the road for two
dialog: hours. Can I trouble you for water?
text: News footage of a ROAD BLOCK, as police check car after car.
text: Then, the TV goes full screen on Frank’s photo. Barry’s head
text: swivels, trying to get comfortable.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (trying to stay calm)
dialog: Henry, go grab Evelyn some water.
text: Henry heads to the kitchen.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Was he difficult?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Not at all. We had the best time
dialog: with Barry. We went outside...
dialog: Threw the ball around...
text: Barry's head stops. His eyes lock on the TV.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Did you put on sunscreen?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Of course... Of course.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Fwa...?
text: Evelyn continues to go on about her son’s sensitive skin.

speaker_heading: BARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to his mom)
text: FWAK... FWAK...
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes, I know, we're going.
text: The TV report continues to detail Frank’s escape. His MUG

text: Henry returns with the water. Evelyn takes a sip.
dialog: 128
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: (getting impatient)
text: FWAK, FWAK... FWAK...!
text: It’s loud and borders on a seizure. Adele and Henry watch,
text: trying to stay calm. Adele’s hands begin to tremble.
text: Evelyn is simply annoyed.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Okay, I know. We’re going home. I
dialog: just need a sip of water...
text: Barry grabs his mother’s wrist. He yanks her in the direction
text: of the screen.
speaker_heading: BARRY
speaker_heading: FW’ RANK!
text: For the first time, Barry has truly pronounced the name.
text: Evelyn pauses. Staring at the TV. She looks back at Barry.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: We will watch TV when we get home.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: (grabs her wrist again)
text: FW' RANK...
text: Evelyn SLAPS BARRY HARD across the face.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Stop it.
text: The hit makes Henry and Adele jump.
text: Barry stops. Everything stops.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: You need some rest.
text: She begins wheeling Barry out.
scene_heading: EXT. ADELE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 128
text: Adele and Henry watch Evelyn’s STATION WAGON drive off. Barry

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, ADELE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 129
text: Henry finishes brushing his teeth. He rinses off the brush
text: and goes to leave, when he hears murmuring from his mother’s
text: bedroom. As Henry gets closer to the door, we begin to hear
dialog: the conversation.
speaker_heading: ADELE (0.C.)
dialog: You were so young... Why didn’t you
dialog: appeal?
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.C.)
dialog: Don’t know... Thought I got what I
dialog: deserved.
speaker_heading: ADELE (0.C.)
dialog: You don’t still feel that now...?
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.C.)
dialog: Now it doesn’t matter.
speaker_heading: ADELE (0.C.)
dialog: Were you scared?
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.C.)
dialog: In prison? Sure.
speaker_heading: ADELE (0.C.)
dialog: No, when you jumped.
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.C.)
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (gives it a thought)
dialog: Didn’t even think about it.
text: Henry slowly opens the door until he can peek into the room.
text: Frank is lying shirtless on the bed. Adele lies across him,
text: with her head on his chest. She’s slowly tracing the scar on
text: his abdomen with COTTON AND ANTISEPTIC.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I can’t imagine not being free.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Can’t call myself free till I can
dialog: walk down the street. Arm around you.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I'd like that.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Take you on road trips to places we
dialog: don’t know a soul.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Like on the run?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, Bonnie. On the run.
text: This catches Henry’s attention.
text: After a beat, something occurs to Adele.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I bet they wouldn’t care who you
dialog: were in Nova Scotia.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In Canada?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Or Prince Edward Island. Nobody
dialog: bothers you up there.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You been?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Once, when I was little. It’s
dialog: beautiful. Villages and beaches and
dialog: salt water marshes. Someone could
dialog: just fall in there.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cold?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: You're a tough guy. I think you
dialog: could take it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Too cold to grow things?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: It’s mostly farms.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sounds nice.
text: Henry begins to imagine it himself.
text: A beat as they all soak in Prince Edward Island.
dialog: 130
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I noticed a spot under the shower
text: where the water’s finding its way
dialog: under the linoleum. Don’t want dry
dialog: rot. Going to tackle that tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Maybe it doesn’t matter.
scene_heading: INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 130
text: Henry in bed. Lost in thought. We hear sounds coming from the
text: next room. Muffled sounds that could be sex, and yet could
dialog: easily be something else. And then... We’re in a dream...
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM — DAY
dialog: The same one in which we found Henry checking out Rachel.
text: Only now it’s empty and the girl seated before him is Eleanor
text: from the grocery store. She stands up and turns around.
text: Stares into his naive eyes.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: What do you want to do?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don’t know.
text: She unbuttons her blouse, revealing... nothing. Like a ghost,
text: we can see the classroom behind Eleanor between the opening
text: in her blouse. Henry pauses. He simply doesn’t have the life
dialog: experience to fill in the information.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I think you know... Come on... Just
dialog: say it...
text: We see flashes of women from the covers of magazines and
text: billboards. Women staring with desire in their eyes.
dialog: Back to Eleanor.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s the matter?
text: She laughs.
dialog: Just as Henry is completely overwhelmed, we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: 132 INT. STAIRS - MORNING 132
text: Henry is walking downstairs, when he again hears Frank and
text: Adele chatting. This time in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: ADELE (0.C.)
dialog: I have a little money. After my mom
dialog: died, I sold the house. It’s just
dialog: sitting in my savings account.
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.C.)
dialog: Wouldn’t need much to start over.
speaker_heading: ADELE (0.C.)
dialog: Just someplace safe.
scene_heading: 133 INT. KITCHEN, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 133
text: Henry walks in to find Adele sitting on the counter. Frank is
text: nearby washing dishes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Morning sport.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: How’d you sleep?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Fine. How about you?
text: Adele and Frank share a laugh. Henry doesn’t quite get it. He
dialog: doesn’t like being outside the joke. Particularly when it
text: comes to his mom.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Well, I was wondering if you could
dialog: do me a little favor.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A little top secret research, if
dialog: you follow?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (Skeptical. Feeling
dialog: replaced)
dialog: Research on what?
dialog: 134
dialog: 135
dialog: 136
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Just a little trip to the library to
dialog: find a book on Prince Edward Island.
dialog: It’s a place in Canada your
dialog: grandparents used to take me.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Well, Frank can’t stay here
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You're going to Canada?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Henry)
dialog: Your mom says it’s beautiful.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I’ve always meant to take you there.
dialog: Can you pick up the book, Hank?
text: Henry looks at his mom. Now she’s using the nickname?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You'd be doing your mother and me a
dialog: big favor.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 134
text: Henry rides his bike. He passes multiple front yard cook
text: outs. We’re reminded of the long weekend by the amount of get-
text: togethers and picnics and slip-n-slides.
scene_heading: EXT. LIBRARY - DAY 135
text: Henry pulls up to a weekend library sale. Older literary
text: types and kids go through bins of used books and tables of
text: homemade pastries. Henry cycles past and parks in an empty
dialog: bike stand.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - DAY 136
text: Henry uses the card catalogue.
text: Henry follows the Dewey Decimals til he reaches a thin volume
text: on Prince Edward Island. He also grabs a couple general
dialog: Canada books.
dialog: 62.
text: Henry sits down at a research desk. There’s only one other
dialog: person in the
text: room. Eleanor. She sits on a leather chair,
text: chewing on a braid, reading a book.
dialog: So,
dialog: Eleanor looks
dialog: Um.
dialog: I'm
dialog: No,
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (a soft try)
dialog: you found one of our city’s hot spots.
text: up and just stares at Henry like he’s crazy.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: (immediately embarrassed)
dialog: -. we talked at the grocery...
dialog: sorry, I didn’t mean to...
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: that was good. Confidence is a
dialog: very attractive quality in a man.
text: This throws Henry off further. He attempts small talk.
dialog: oh,
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: okay... So, do you go to school
dialog: around here?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I just moved here from Chicago. I’m
dialog: supposed to try out living with my
dialog: dad
dialog: oh,
dialog: this year.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: what happened?
text: A beat as Eleanor considers whether or not to get into it.
dialog: The
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: official reason is I have an
dialog: eating disorder and they’re hoping
dialog: a new school environment will help,
dialog: but
dialog: really I think my mom just
dialog: wanted to get rid of me so she can
text: fool around with her boyfriend.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I understand. This guy just moved
dialog: in with my mom and me.
dialog: And
dialog: did
dialog: No,
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: she didn’t even consult you,
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I mean, he kind of just showed up.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: And now he wants you out.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: He will. So they can have sex.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I think they already are.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
text: So the clock is ticking.
text: Eleanor gives the motion of a ticking clock before returning
dialog: to her book.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What are you reading?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I'm investigating my legal rights.
dialog: You see I got into the this really
dialog: great private school where they
dialog: mainly focus on drama, no one cares
dialog: about sports or what kind of
dialog: clothes you wear. The teachers stay
dialog: off your case. It’s really
text: elevated. But at the last minute,
dialog: my parents said they didn’t have
dialog: the money.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Could they get a loan?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Oh, they have the money. They’re
dialog: just using me as a pawn in their
dialog: sick little game. I wrote a letter
dialog: to the school. Asked if I could
dialog: exchange services for tuition.
dialog: Janitorial. Whatever. I haven't
dialog: received a response.
text: Henry moves over to her with his books.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR (CONT'D)
dialog: How about you?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It’s for my mother. She wants to
dialog: know if Canada might be a good
dialog: place to move.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: How do you feel about that? Moving?
dialog: Leaving your friends. I’m asking
dialog: because that’s what I had to do, and
dialog: frankly, I consider it child abuse.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don’t know. Canada seems nice.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Do you even know if they’re taking you?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: My mom wouldn’t leave me behind.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: When people have sex with each
dialog: other it affects their brains. They
dialog: can’t see things normally. It’s
text: like a drug.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I’m not sure if that’s true.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Look it up. It’s clinically proven.
dialog: You can’t blame her. It’s like he
text: cast a spell on her or something.
text: With his penis.
text: Henry tries not to react to her saying this word.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I can hear them in the night.
text: Saying each other’s names.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: So, he’s a sex addict. You don’t
dialog: have an Oedipus complex where you
dialog: want to marry your mom, do you?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: No, I like regular girls. I like my
dialog: mom in the mom way.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (measuring him)
dialog: Right.
dialog: (back to business)
dialog: Well, you’re probably going to need
dialog: an intervention. Maybe even need to
text: deprogram her.
dialog: 137
dialog: 138
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Deprogram her?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (a thought)
dialog: This guy... Does he have charisma?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (he does)
dialog: I think so.
text: Eleanor just nods.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Too bad your mom and my dad couldn’t
dialog: get together before this boyfriend
dialog: person showed up. Of course, then if
dialog: you and I got married, it would be
dialog: kind of like incest.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: My mother doesn’t normally date anyway.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I see only one hope for you. You
dialog: need to find a way to get him out
dialog: of your life.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don’t know if that’s possible.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Either you get rid of him. Or he’ll
dialog: probably get rid of you.
text: This lands heavily on Henry.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE YARD, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 137
text: Henry walks along the side with the books from the library.
text: He’s looking for Adele, but doesn’t see her.
scene_heading: EXT. CORNER, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 138
text: Henry begins to hear his mom and Frank speaking in the
text: backyard. He stops to listen.
text: Frank and Adele share a sweet moment.
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.C.)
dialog: Couldn’t take a lot. Packed car
dialog: might seem suspicious.
speaker_heading: ADELE (0.C.)
dialog: We'd just start driving? Just like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.C.)
dialog: You wouldn’t be able to tell your
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: ADELE (0.C.)
dialog: No one to tell really.
dialog: (a thought)
dialog: My ex-husband would never let me
dialog: take Henry away.
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.C.)
dialog: You know what that would mean?
text: Henry waits for the ending of this thought, when Frank rounds
text: the corner with a stripping knife.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, you just get back?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (nervous )
dialog: Yeah, I... got the books.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (enters)
dialog: Hey, kiddo.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey buddy, you got back just in the
dialog: nick of time. We’re giving the
dialog: porch a new coat. Want to help
dialog: scrape the paint with me?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Frank thinks we could knock out
dialog: this job in no time if we all
dialog: pitched in.
dialog: We can read Henry’s lack of trust.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: No thanks.
text: It upsets Henry.
dialog: *
dialog: *
dialog: 139
dialog: 67.
text: Adele is confused.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I thought it would be a fun project
dialog: for us to do together. You could
dialog: fill us in on what you learned at
dialog: the library.
text: Henry thinks about what he learned. Brainwashing.
text: Deprogramming. Frank places a firm hand on Henry’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I think you should help your mother
dialog: here, son.
text: Henry looks back at Frank.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Stop pretending to be my dad.
text: Frank withdraws his hand. Henry leaves the room.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Come on, Henry...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 139
text: Henry settles in front of the TV. The Jerry Lewis Telethon is
text: on. Henry’s eyes wander and he notices the newspaper -
text: Frank's face is on the cover again. He picks it up.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: If price were an indication of how
dialog: intent the police were on capturing a
dialog: suspect, they sure wanted Frank bad.
text: Big words spell out that there is now a TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR
text: REWARD for Frank’s capture.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: Ten thousand dollars. I could buy a
dialog: dirt bike... A video camera... A
dialog: paintball gun...
text: We see catalogue images of each of these items.
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.C.)
dialog: Not a very flattering picture.
text: Henry drops the paper as he notices Frank standing above him,
text: holding the paint scraper.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I was thinking we could throw
text: around the ball for a bit.
text: ON TV - Jerry Lewis is next to a girl in leg braces.
speaker_heading: JERRY LEWIS (ON TV)
dialog: What do you say friends? Doesn't
dialog: Angela deserve a chance like the
dialog: rest of us?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I’m watching a show.
text: Frank takes a beat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen, there will never be a day
dialog: you aren’t numero uno in her book,
dialog: and I would never change that.
text: To be fair, Henry doesn’t know what to believe.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It’s Sunday night. My dad’s picking
dialog: me up soon so you probably
dialog: shouldn’t be out.
text: Frank backs down. Nods and heads back to join Adele. Henry
text: has a moment of satisfaction by his ability to stand up for
text: himself. Applause from the telethon.

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: We'll have to smuggle him then. I

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: They think they’re in charge of me.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR

text: Henry’s face rejects the idea.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I couldn’t do that to her.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: For a while she'd be sad. Eventually
dialog: she'd thank you. You could get rich,
dialog: you know.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: They shouldn’t reward people for
dialog: doing that kind of thing.
text: Eleanor runs a hand down the front of Henry’s shirt.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Don’t you think we should know each

text: to the clinic.

speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I'll be fine. Don’t want to take
dialog: you away from your duties.
scene_heading: OFFICER TREADWELL
dialog: I think the streets are safe for a
dialog: moment.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Well, yes, thank you then...
text: Adele leads Treadwell into the...
scene_heading: INT. ENTRYWAY, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 227
text: Treadwell looks around, taking the place in. It can’t help
text: but look a little like he’s scoping the place out.
text: Henry watches him carefully from the kitchen doorway.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (pointing to a box)
dialog: That’s the heavy one.
text: Treadwell tips his hat and picks it up.
scene_heading: OFFICER TREADWELL
dialog: You weren't kidding... What do you
dialog: got in here?
speaker_heading: ADELE
text: Some old kitchenware.
text: He smiles and carries it out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 228
text: The officer places the box in the trunk of the car. Adele
text: steps up from behind him.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Thank you for your help.
scene_heading: OFFICER TREADWELL
dialog: (extends a hand)
dialog: Pleasure.
text: Adele's hands are in her dress pockets. We know they’re
text: shaking. She holds back. Just long enough to get a
text: questioning look from the officer, when...
dialog: 229
dialog: 230
speaker_heading: 231
dialog: 232
dialog: 106.
text: Henry takes the officer’s hand. An odd look for a second.
speaker_heading: OFFICER TREADWELL (CONT’D)
dialog: That's a firm grip you got there,
dialog: partner.
dialog: (tips his hat again)
dialog: Have a good day, ma’am.
text: The officer returns to his cruiser. He takes one last look at
text: the house before getting in his car and driving off.
text: Adele exhales.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRYWAY, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 229
text: Adele and Henry enter the house as Frank descends from
text: upstairs. Look out the window just as the cruiser drives off.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He seem suspicious?
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I couldn’t tell. No more than a
dialog: policeman usually is, I suppose.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We got to get out of here. Take
dialog: Henry to the bank, while I finish
dialog: up here.
dialog: (takes Adele)
dialog: We're going to be fine.
text: Henry watches as Frank infuses confidence into his mother.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK PARKING LOT - DAY 230
text: Adele sits in the car with Henry. She’s visualizing the whole
text: transaction in her head. Breathing. Henry watches nervously.
text: After a moment, she looks at Henry. She’s ready.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK - DAY 231
text: Adele and Henry walk up just as the security is unlocking the
text: door. Adele has put on something she perceives as professional.
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY 232
text: Adele and Henry enter and walk up to the table of withdrawal
text: slips. Adele nervously fills one out.
dialog: 107.
text: They walk up to the front of the line, waiting to be called
text: forward. Adele cups the top of the stanchion with her hand,
text: shaking slightly. Henry notices. Henry’s regular TELLER waves *
dialog: them over.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: Good morning. Nice to see you in *
dialog: here. *
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (short)
dialog: Hi.
text: Adele passes the withdrawal slip.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: You have to sign it.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Of course...
text: Adele snaps it back and scrawls a signature.
speaker_heading: TELLER *
dialog: I would have thought you would be
dialog: in school today.
speaker_heading: ADELE
text: He has a dentist appointment.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: On the first day of school?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: My teeth hurt.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: Oh... sorry.
speaker_heading: ADELE *
dialog: (hands the slip) *
dialog: It’s for the dentist.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: That’s some expensive dental work.
speaker_heading: ADELE
text: --. he’s also getting braces.
speaker_heading: TELLER *
dialog: And you'd like this all in cash? *
speaker_heading: ADELE *
dialog: ... Uh huh. yes. *
dialog: 233
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: With an amount this large, I just
dialog: need to get it approved by my
dialog: supervisor. I'll be right back.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Oh, is that really...?
text: The teller has already disappeared in the back.
text: Adele looks around the room and spots a new mother with her
text: baby in a frontpack. Her breathing becomes slightly irregular.
text: Henry observes his mother. Trying to keep it together.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRYWAY, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 233
text: The front door has been left slightly ajar. Frank is fixing
text: something in the living room. Out of nowhere, there’s a knock
text: at the door and before he can turn around... Evelyn is
text: walking into the entryway, carrying a pan of cinnamon rolls.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Adele...?!
text: Evelyn and Frank turn and spot each other. They freeze.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh... hi. Is Adele home?
text: A game of chicken. Does she recognize him?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She'll be right back. She’s just
dialog: dropping Henry at school.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: (still weary)
dialog: Oh, okay.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Anything I can help you with?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I just brought these for her... to
dialog: thank her for something...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’1ll make sure she gets them.
text: Frank goes to take them. Evelyn observes his face.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Are you a friend?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Handyman.
scene_heading: 234 INT. BANK - DAY 234
text: Adele sees the teller returning with the BANK MANAGER.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I shouldn’t have tried to get so
dialog: much... I should have asked for half.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It’s going to be fine. They’re just
dialog: being extra careful.
text: The manager arrives.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Hi Adele. Just wanted to make sure you
dialog: weren't experiencing any problems.
text: Adele is reading everything into all statements right now.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: No, everything is fine.
scene_heading: 235 INT. ENTRYWAY, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 235
text: Evelyn looks around the room. Notices things are missing.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: «+. Is she going somewhere?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don’t know...
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: «+. Sure looks like it.
text: An understanding is beginning to settle between them.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Well, maybe I should get my plate
dialog: back... In case she’s gone for a while.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not a bad idea.
text: Frank leaves and returns with a roll of wax paper.
dialog: 236
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: They say where they might be going?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m just here to fix a few things.
scene_heading: INT. BANK — DAY 236
text: Adele hides her shaking hands under the counter. Henry sees
text: them, but keeps his eyes on the manager. Now the baby begins
text: crying. With each cry, we can almost feel Adele’s will being
text: slowly cracked away.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: It’s just a somewhat unusual
dialog: situation, having a person withdraw
dialog: this much in cash.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: It just seems handier.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Normally, when transferring funds
dialog: of this quantity, our clients
dialog: prefer a cashier’s check.
text: Adele desperately doesn’t want to arouse suspicion.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: I simply prefer cash... I don’t
dialog: really get out much anymore...
text: The manager studies this response, trying to figure her out.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Some would even call this kind of
text: withdrawal a little suspicious.
dialog: We can tell Adele is at her breaking point when...
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Actually, we’ve packed up all our
dialog: things. We’re emptying our bank
dialog: account and making a run for the
dialog: border like Bonnie and Clyde.
text: A long beat. The manager takes one look at this impossible
text: duo of runaways and CRACKS UP. The teller joins in. Adele,
text: incredulous, attempts a laugh. Frank was right. No one
dialog: believes the truth.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Of course you are! Come on Muriel,
dialog: let's not keep our friends here
dialog: waiting any longer.
text: The manager scribbles a signature on something. The teller
text: begins counting out bills. Hundreds followed by twenties.
text: Henry watches as the cash is fanned out in front of him.
speaker_heading: TELLER
dialog: Do you need something to carry it
dialog: all in?
scene_heading: 237 INT. ADELE’S STATION WAGON - DAY 237
text: Adele hops in and immediately starts hyperventilating.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: We should go.
text: Adele starts up the car.
scene_heading: 238 EXT. ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 238
text: Adele pulls up. They hop out of the car and head up the stairs.
text: Just as Adele goes to put the key in the door, Frank yanks open
text: the door and pulls them both inside. Shuts the door.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Henry’s father called. Left a
dialog: message.
dialog: (angry to Henry)
dialog: Did you leave him some sort of note?
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: He never checks the mail in the morning.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (suddenly alert)
dialog: We need to go.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I just wanted him to know I’d be
dialog: alright.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Why would you do that Henry?!
dialog: 239
dialog: 240
dialog: 241
dialog: 242
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (quick)
dialog: We need to go now.
text: Henry starts running up the stairs.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I just need to say goodbye to my
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Henry, don’t, we need to leave!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen to your mother!
scene_heading: INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - DAY 239
text: Henry is trying to say a quick good bye to everything. His
text: eyes dart around at all of his possessions.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRYWAY, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 240
text: Frank and Adele in a panic.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Henry!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m getting him.
text: Frank gets two steps up the stairs, when he stops. He hears
text: it. Adele hears it.
scene_heading: INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - DAY 241
text: Henry hears it too... SIRENS.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRYWAY, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 242
text: Henry walks down the stairs to find Frank holding Adele’s
text: hand. The sirens are very close now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t be scared.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: Do you think Henry’s father called them?
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: He never checks the mail in the morning.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: (upset)
dialog: How do you know anything that
dialog: happens in that house?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s all right, Adele.
text: We hear the cruisers begin pulling up onto the lawn.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: What do we do?
text: A helicopter flies overhead. Adele looks up. Frank doesn’t.
text: Frank shakes his head “no”.
speaker_heading: ADELE (CONT'D)
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: No...
text: She grabs Frank and holds him tight.
text: Henry sees his mother dig her fingers into Frank’s skin, like
text: she’s trying to penetrate and grab his bones.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (0.C.)
dialog: (over a bullhorn)
text: WE HAVE A PERIMETER. OPEN THE DOOR
text: SLOWLY. STEP OUT WITH YOUR HANDS
scene_heading: OPEN AND ABOVE YOUR HEAD. PALMS
text: FACING FORWARD...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen, Adele. We don’t have time
dialog: to discuss this. I want you to do
dialog: everything I say here.
text: Adele’s shoulders are shaking.
text: Henry watches as Frank walks Adele over to a kitchen chair.
text: The same one from the beginning of the film. The ropes are
text: still attached to the arms and legs of the chair.
text: Frank sits Adele down. This makes Adele begin to inhale quickly.
text: The way one does before crying... but she refuses to cry.
text: Frank ties each ankle to a chair leg. Kissing each one after
text: pulling the knot tight.
text: He then ties her wrists behind her back. He takes a breath.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (0.C.)
dialog: (over a bullhorn)
dialog: IF YOU DO NOT COMPLY WITH OUR
text: ORDERS, WE WILL BE FORCED TO BREACH
scene_heading: THE HOUSE. OPEN THE DOOR SLOWLY...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (grabs a chair)
dialog: Henry, sit down.
text: Henry complies.
text: Frank grabs a roll of PACKING TAPE they used to box their
text: possessions. He quickly yanks out a couple feet of tape and
text: begins wrapping Henry’s legs to the chair.
text: He takes Henry’s wrists and quickly binds them together.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a fine boy, Henry. Anyone who
dialog: says otherwise is just jealous and not
dialog: worth your time. Be yourself. A man is
text: someone who is true to his instincts.
dialog: Always be a man.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (0.C.)
dialog: (over a bullhorn)
text: THIS IS YOUR FINAL WARNING. EXIT
scene_heading: THE PREMISES IMMEDIATELY, OR WE
text: WILL USE FORCE.
text: Frank walks back over to Adele.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'd take twenty more years just to
dialog: spend another three days with you.
dialog: As long as I am alive, you are
dialog: never alone, Adele.
text: Frank kisses her one more time. It lingers on the end of
text: their lips for a moment, then he quickly stands.
text: We watch from Henry’s point of view as Frank steps up to the
text: entryway. He slowly opens the front door.
text: A FLOOD OF SOUND enters the house. Sirens. The Chopper.
text: Shotguns chambering rounds.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (0.C.)
dialog: (over a bullhorn)
dialog: HANDS UP! HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD!
text: Frank complies, raising his palms to the sky.
dialog: 243
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (0.C.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (over a bullhorn)
text: SLOWLY NOW, ONE FOOT AFTER THE
text: OTHER. WALK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE
speaker_heading: STEPS.
text: Frank steps out of the doorway. Out of our view.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (0.C.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (over a bullhorn)
scene_heading: TURN AROUND, FACE THE HOUSE... NOW
dialog: DOWN ON YOUR KNEES...
text: Adele finally lets go. She’s crying. Henry looks lost.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (0.C.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (over a bullhorn)
dialog: PLACE YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD...
dialog: INTERLACE YOUR FINGERS...
text: A SUDDEN RUSH OF SOUND as we hear the officers surround Frank
text: and CUFF HIM. Within a moment, OFFICERS storm into the house,
text: “CLEARING” each room.
text: Two officers drop down next to Adele and Henry, releasing
text: them from their binds.
text: A PARAMEDIC puts a blanket around Adele. Notices her crying.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: Give me room...!
dialog: (to Adele)
dialog: Okay, I need to run a couple
dialog: tests... Can you hear me okay? Tell
dialog: me your name...
text: A SPECIAL SERVICE OFFICER kneels next to Henry.
speaker_heading: SPECIAL SERVICES
dialog: Don't be scared, son. Your mom is
dialog: going to be fine. We got the guy.
dialog: He won't be able to do anything to
dialog: you and your mom anymore.
text: Henry looks out the window and sees Frank being shoved
text: towards a police car.
scene_heading: EXT. ADELE’S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 243
text: Adele is being walked out. The blanket is still over her
text: shoulders. Henry follows her.
text: Gerald's MINIVAN pulls up outside the POLICE TAPE.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: (getting out of the van)
dialog: Henry...? Henry?!
text: Just as this is happening, The SQUAD CAR carrying FRANK
text: begins to pull out from the crime scene.
text: Adele and Frank make eye contact. Through the moving
text: reflections along the window, we barely see Frank mouth one
dialog: word... “Adele...”
text: The squad car slowly passes Gerald, who looks into the
text: backseat incredulous as to what is still going on.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: They charged him with kidnapping.
scene_heading: 244 INT. COURT ROOM - DAY 244
text: Showing Frank at his sentencing hearing. He’s lead back
text: through a doorway into a HOLDING CELL.

dialog: This time, they’d lock him up and
dialog: throw away the key, they said.
scene_heading: 245 EXT. CAPITAL BUILDING - DAY 245
text: Adele and Henry enter the gilded front doors.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: When my mother heard, she drove to
dialog: see the prosecutor with me as a
dialog: witness, to make him understand
dialog: that no unlawful detainment had
dialog: taken place.
scene_heading: 246 INT. PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 246
text: Adele is pouring her heart out for what looks like a
text: hardliner PROSECUTOR.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: She had invited Frank into her
dialog: home. He was good to her son. He
dialog: was good to her. She omitted the
dialog: fact that they were in love.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: Adele, these situations are never
dialog: simple. Never clean.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 247
dialog: 248
dialog: 249
dialog: 250
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: May take years for you to fully weave
dialog: it all together. Perhaps before you
dialog: put this kind of statement into
dialog: record, you might want to take a
dialog: little time to think about what
dialog: actually happened. Harboring a
dialog: fugitive is a major crime that we
dialog: don’t look lightly upon. And of
dialog: course there’s delinquency to a
dialog: minor. You could lose custody of your
dialog: son...
text: Adele looks to Henry and back to the prosecutor.
scene_heading: INT. OLD PRISON - DAY 247
text: Old steel bars have rusted over. Frank is let out of his
text: cell. He walks up to a pass through window, where he is
text: handed a lunch tray.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: They gave Frank ten years for the
text: escape and fifteen for the kidnapping.
text: Corridor of lunch tables. Frank sits down and eats.

dialog: Sometime after that, they transferred
text: him to someplace in Massachusetts.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 250
text: Adele tries to open a can of soup. Her hands shake worse than
dialog: we've ever seen them.

dialog: 253
dialog: 254
dialog: 255
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. BREAKFAST ROOM, GERALD’S HOUSE - DAY 254
text: Henry and Richard eat cereal across from each other. Marjorie
text: makes sure Chloe eats. Gerald stops reading his paper to say
text: something to Henry, but comes up empty.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: My Father rarely knew what to say.
dialog: More often than not, he just kept
dialog: quiet. The newspapers had said it
dialog: all anyway.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH - DAY 255
text: Henry transfers books from his backpack to his locker.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)

text: Rachel McCann stops next to Henry.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Is it true that he tortured you?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I heard your mother was his sex slave.
text: Henry doesn’t know how to process this statement.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: That’s weird.
speaker_heading: RACHEL

text: Henry steps inside. Adele is making busy. Putting things
text: away. Acting as though she is overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: When I visited my mother, she would
text: act busy and distracted. Calls to

dialog: presence made her uncomfortable. A
text: strange reminder of what was missing.
scene_heading: 258 INT. ADELE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 258

text: We find Adele in bed reading a book.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY
dialog: In particular, a book called Living

dialog: dropped out of society and moved to

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 259

text: Gerald laughs it off a little.
speaker_heading: GERALD
dialog: Look, this is all I’1ll say. Everybody

dialog: songs. Your mother was like that.
text: Henry looks up.
speaker_heading: GERALD (CONT'D)
dialog: She was in love with love. She
dialog: couldn’t do anything partway.
text: Henry has stopped eating. He never gets to hear these things.
speaker_heading: GERALD (CONT'D)
dialog: That trip we took to California. We
text: had no money. Slept in the car. One
dialog: town in Nebraska, we got a motel

dialog: 264
dialog: 265
dialog: 122.
text: Gerald smiles. Lost in thought.
speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: I had never thought I looked
dialog: anything like my father. We seemed
dialog: so different. But looking across
text: the table then, as he spoke about
dialog: my mother, I recognized, weirdly,

text: Henry’s eyes begin to moisten.
scene_heading: INT. NEW PRISON LIBRARY - DAY 277

speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)
dialog: The opportunities for me to impart

speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)
dialog: However, I am due to be released

text: Henry looks to his wife.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)

speaker_heading: ADULT HENRY (V.O.)
dialog: The real drug, I came to believe,
dialog: was love.
text: The fence begins to move. It reveals Frank. Adele sits up.
