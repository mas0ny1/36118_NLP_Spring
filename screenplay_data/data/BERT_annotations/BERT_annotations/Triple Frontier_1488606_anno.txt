dialog: Dear Readers,
dialog: After an exhaustive search, I managed to locate Mark Boal’s
dialog: original draft of “Triple Frontier.”
dialog: I don’t know exactly what version this is. However, from
dialog: examining the metadata I do know that this was written on or
dialog: around October 13, 2010. And “modified” February 26, 2015.
dialog: If there is any interest, I can “clean it up” a little and make

dialog: For now, though, here is Mark Boal’s original “Triple Frontier”
