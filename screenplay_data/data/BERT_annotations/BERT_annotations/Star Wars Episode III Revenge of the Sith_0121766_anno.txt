dialog: George Lucas
scene_heading: 1 EXT. SPACE
text: A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
text: A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which
text: crawls into infinity.
text: War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku.
text: There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere.
text: In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the
text: Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate.
text: As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable
text: hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . .
text: PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the
text: Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser.
text: TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy
text: laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin's ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle
text: is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.
scene_heading: 2 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
text: OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently.
scene_heading: 3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
text: ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.
dialog: ANAKIN: There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get
dialog: to the Chancellor . . .
text: OBI-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . .
scene_heading: 4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE
text: The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID
text: DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the
text: FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.
scene_heading: 5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
text: OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.
dialog: OBI-WAN: We've got to split them up.
text: ANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.
text: OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO
text: DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?
dialog: ANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.
text: OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO
text: DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Anakin, they're all over me!
text: ANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo. ..
text: ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of
text: the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.
text: ANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!
text: ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an
text: angry warning.
dialog: ANAKIN: I copy, Artoo.
dialog: OBI-WAN: I'm going down on the deck.
dialog: ANAKIN: Good idea ... [need some room to maneuver.
text: OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION
text: BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the
text: surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN.
text: ANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle
dialog: on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!
text: ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Hurry up! I don't like this!
text: OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID
text: DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go
text: flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch!
text: R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.
dialog: OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.
dialog: ANAKIN: We're locked on ... we've got him...
text: ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO
text: SQUEALS with delight.
dialog: ANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him. . . good going, Artoo.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on
dialog: with it...
text: R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.
text: ANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead.
text: ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.
text: ANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.
scene_heading: 6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
dialog: OBI-WAN: I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.
text: Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE
text: FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into
text: flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.
dialog: ANAKIN: Come on, Master.
text: OBI-WAN: Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you
dialog: copy?
scene_heading: ODD BALL: (OS) Copy, Red Leader.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Mark my position and form your squad up behind me...
scene_heading: 7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
text: ODD BALL: We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.
text: The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION
text: CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID
text: VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the
text: stability foils on the ends of their wings.
scene_heading: 8 INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE
text: ANAKIN: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down
text: the left side.
text: ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right. . .
dialog: ANAKIN: I'm going head to head. See you.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Take it easy, Anakin.
text: Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.
dialog: ODD BALL: I'm on your right, Red Leader.
dialog: ANAKIN: Incoming!!
text: ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Five more on the right!
text: Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell
text: breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other.
scene_heading: ARTOO SQUEALS.
dialog: ANAKIN: Here we go.
text: The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS,
text: ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.
dialog: OBI-WAN: I'm going high and right.
text: ANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let
dialog: them pass between us.
text: ANAKIN: I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.
text: OBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.
text: In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS,
text: blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.
text: ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER,
text: slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front.
text: ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships.
text: ANAKIN looks behind him.
text: ANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four...
dialog: that's not good.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail.
dialog: ANAKIN: I know. I know!
text: OBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left.
dialog: ANAKIN: I know. I know!
dialog: OBI-WAN: Break right and go high.
dialog: ANAKIN: I'm going low and left.
text: Obi-Wan shakes his head.
dialog: OBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn.
text: ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP,
text: dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.
dialog: ANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the
dialog: needle...
dialog: OBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."
dialog: ANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.
text: OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin.
scene_heading: ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.
text: OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING
text: four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade
text: Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a
text: small slit between two main struts.
dialog: OBI-WAN: (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.
text: ARTOO BEEPS nervously.
dialog: ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.
text: ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE
dialog: NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."
dialog: ANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo.
text: ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS
speaker_heading: CRASH.
dialog: ANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through.
text: OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into
text: the EXPLOSION.
text: A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into
dialog: space.
text: Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE
text: FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.
dialog: ODD BALL: There are too many of them.
text: CLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them
dialog: off my...
dialog: ANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out!
dialog: OBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command
dialog: Ship!
text: Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE
text: DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.
dialog: ANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up!
text: ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN
text: does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two
text: missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left,
text: causing one of the missiles to overshoot.
dialog: OBI-WAN: They overshot us. . .
text: The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan’s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship
text: rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all
dialog: around them.
dialog: ANAKIN: They're coming around!
dialog: OBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.
dialog: ANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.
text: ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.
dialog: ANAKIN: We got ‘em. Artoo!
text: Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Flying is for droids.
text: Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the
text: Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and
text: detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The
text: balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface
dialog: like spiders.
dialog: OBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?
text: ANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids.
text: The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS
text: ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS
text: goes after ARFOUR.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .
text: ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.
text: ANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
text: OBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out
dialog: of tricks here.
text: ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns
text: are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan’s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and
text: vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship.
dialog: OBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ...
dialog: ANAKIN: Steady... steady. . .
dialog: OBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.
dialog: ANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . .. steady...
text: OBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over
dialog: me, Anakin.
dialog: ANAKIN: Move to the right.
text: OBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's
dialog: nothing more you can do.
dialog: ANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master.
text: ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ
text: DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's
text: ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's
text: ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view.
text: ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto
text: Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.
text: OBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.
dialog: ANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!
text: OBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.
text: ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID.
text: The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.
dialog: ANAKIN: Yeah, you got him!
dialog: OBI-WAN: Great, Artoo.
text: ANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . .
dialog: pull up ... Head for the hangar.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up?
dialog: ANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master.
text: ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield
text: generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.
scene_heading: 9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay,
text: engulfed ina FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut
text: across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.
text: ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast
text: doors SLAM shut.
text: OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just
text: as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.
text: ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to
text: where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.
text: OBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor.
text: ANAKIN: Tap into the ship's computers.
text: They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket.
text: The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor.
text: Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.
text: OBI-WAN: The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform
text: at the top of that spire.
dialog: ANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . ..
dialog: OBI-WAN: I sense a trap.
dialog: ANAKIN: Next move?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: Spring the trap.
text: The JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.
dialog: ANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders.
text: OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.
scene_heading: 10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser
text: followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in
text: front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.
dialog: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: What's the situation, Captain?
text: CAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted.
scene_heading: 11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: ANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.
text: BODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.
dialog: OBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.
text: As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-
dialog: to-back.
scene_heading: OBI-WAN: Anakin. . .
dialog: ANAKIN: Ready.
text: ANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.
scene_heading: 12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge
text: EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and
text: fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN.
text: dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.
dialog: OBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into
dialog: oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.
dialog: ANAKIN: Well then, we're safe for the time being.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.
text: They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling
text: more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the
text: fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO
text: throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with
text: SPARKING excess power dischargers.
dialog: ANAKIN: They're sealing this section off.
text: OBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way!
text: The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.
dialog: ANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.
text: They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets
text: closer to the SPARKING dischargers.
dialog: OBI-WAN: We'll never get through that. It's too small!
text: They move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to
text: within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another
text: smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-
text: WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It
text: pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the
text: SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.
text: The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then
text: pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.
dialog: ANAKIN: I found our escape vent.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.
dialog: ANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure.
dialog: 
text: ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel
text: loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim
dialog: closer.
scene_heading: 13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small
text: hatch in the side of the tube.
dialog: ANAKIN: Here's a way out.
text: As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to
text: within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the
text: pressure lock, opening the latch.
scene_heading: 14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their
text: way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.
scene_heading: 15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI
text: squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his
dialog: laser sword.
dialog: OBI-WAN: That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.
text: ANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.
dialog: OBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin.
scene_heading: 16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77
text: and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise
text: toward the power discharger.
text: SUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this.
scene_heading: 17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE
text: A GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation
dialog: Cruiser.
scene_heading: 19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-
text: WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.
dialog: OBI-WAN: All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!
text: ANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.
scene_heading: 20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to
text: face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin
text: deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.
dialog: ANAKIN: Destroyers!!
text: Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door
text: slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.
dialog: BATTLE DROID: Drop your weapons! I said drop ‘em.
text: The JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.
scene_heading: 21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: R2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides
text: behind a Jedi Starfighter.
scene_heading: 22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Did you press the stop button?
dialog: ANAKIN: No, did you?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: No!
dialog: ANAKIN: Well, there's more than one way out of here.
text: ANAKIN ignites his laser sword.
dialog: OBI-WAN: We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo .. . Artoo. Do you
text: copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel)... 31174...
text: ANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.
scene_heading: 23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-
text: Wan's voice over the comlink and are distracted.
scene_heading: SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: What's that?
text: SUPER BATTLE DROID 2: Get back to work. It's nothing.
scene_heading: 24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: Artoo?
text: ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.
dialog: OBI-WAN: (continuing) Always on the move.
text: OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.
scene_heading: 25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: ARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure
text: out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a
text: computer interface.
text: OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave
dialog: you a job to do! Artoo.
scene_heading: 26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: Suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto
text: the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears.
text: ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down
text: on him.
scene_heading: 27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The elevator starts to descend rapidly.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.
scene_heading: 28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: Anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the
text: elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and
text: look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.
dialog: DROID 1: Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.
dialog: DROID 2: Roger, roger.
scene_heading: 29 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN's comlink messages to
speaker_heading: ARTOO.
text: SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: There it is again.
scene_heading: OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be
text: going up, not down.
scene_heading: 30 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.
text: OBI-WAN: Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!
text: The elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.
scene_heading: 31 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward the little droid.
text: SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: Hey you!
text: ARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up.
scene_heading: 32 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: OBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Now, that's better . . .
scene_heading: 33 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: ARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle as the little Astro
text: Droid curses and swings at them.
text: SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: You stupid little astro droid!
scene_heading: 34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: ANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed.
text: He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He
text: calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator
dialog: shaft.
text: Before ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the
text: shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back
text: through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Oh, it's you . . .
scene_heading: 35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: ARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER
text: BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.
scene_heading: 36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

scene_heading: 38 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: The elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room
dialog: of the General's Quarters.
text: At the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN
text: move toward the CHANCELLOR.
text: As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor.
dialog: ANAKIN: Are you all right?
dialog: PALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku.
text: PALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn
text: around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT
text: DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two
text: SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.
dialog: OBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.
dialog: ANAKIN: I was about to say that.
text: COUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.
dialog: PALPATINE: Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
text: OBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.
dialog: COUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of
text: things in front of the Chancellor.
text: OBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.
dialog: OBI-WAN: You won't get away this time, Dooku.
text: OBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.
dialog: COUNT DOOKU: I've been looking forward to this.
dialog: ANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
dialog: COUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.
text: DOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .
dialog: COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable.
dialog: You'll have to do better.
text: As the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger
text: as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT
text: DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force.
text: ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of
text: the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the
text: top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds
text: OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-
dialog: WAN is choking.
text: ANAKIN hits the archway.
text: DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious.
text: COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the
text: balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending
text: him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT
text: DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.
dialog: COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you
dialog: have anger, but you don’t use them.
text: Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues
text: his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.
text: Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.
scene_heading: 39 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge,
text: ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops
text: from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN
text: puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT
text: DOOKU's defeat.
dialog: PALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!
dialog: ANAKIN: I shouldn't. . .
dialog: PALPATINE: Do it!!
text: ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in
text: the ship rattles everything.
dialog: ANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself.
dialog: PALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
text: ANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE.
text: ANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
text: ANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair.
text: The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.
dialog: ANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.
text: PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.
dialog: PALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't
dialog: the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand
text: People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.
text: The ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control
text: console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his
text: unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.
dialog: PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's
dialog: too late.
text: ANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.
dialog: PALPATINE: Leave him, or we'll never make it.
dialog: ANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours.

text: before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and
text: PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control
text: box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they
text: are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.
scene_heading: 53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER,

dialog: ANAKIN: Easy. . .. We're in a bit of a situation.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Did I miss something?
text: OBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO
text: BEEPING on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to
text: move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to

scene_heading: ANAKINN: Hold on.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: What is that?

speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: (continuing) Oops.
dialog: ANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!
dialog: OBI-WAN: Too late! Jump!
text: They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and
text: they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft
text: continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.
text: ANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they
text: continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through
text: the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.
scene_heading: 54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.

scene_heading: 56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.
scene_heading: 57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay
text: doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the
text: atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.
dialog: OBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.
dialog: ANAKIN: I agree.
dialog: PALPATINE: What are we going to do?
dialog: ANAKIN: I don't know.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Don't look at me. I don't know.
text: ANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's
text: Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on
dialog: its side.
dialog: ANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.
text: OBI-WAN: We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.
text: ANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt.
text: PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility
text: cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.
scene_heading: 58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: OBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall.
text: As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him.
text: The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them
text: up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the
text: ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized
text: hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but
text: ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on
text: the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as
text: the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to
text: pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds.
text: The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some
text: bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a
text: hangar doorway and close it behind them.
scene_heading: 59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

scene_heading: 61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an
text: electronic box in the middle of the hallway.
dialog: ANAKIN: Ray shields!
text: OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.
dialog: ANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was
dialog: distracted.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.
dialog: ANAKIN: You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
dialog: OBI-WAN: I'm open to suggestions here.
dialog: PALPATINE: Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count
dialog: Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.
text: The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.
dialog: ANAKIN: I say . . . patience.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Patience! That's your plan, is it?
dialog: ANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .
text: ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a
dialog: moment to compose himself.
dialog: ANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem.
text: Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN
text: SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.
text: ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO
dialog: over.
text: SUPER BATTLE DROID: Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B?
scene_heading: 62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: OBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL
text: GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting
dialog: for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.
text: A BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI'S
dialog: lightsabers.
dialog: OBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah!
dialog: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your
dialog: reputation to be a little older.
dialog: ANAKIN: General Grievous . .. Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're
dialog: shorter than I expected.
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahbhh, Jedi scum. . .
dialog: OBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.
dialog: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won't escape.
dialog: ANAKIN: Artoo.
text: ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses,
text: and bouncing around.
text: OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the
text: Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He
text: continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer!
text: ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand.
text: The DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the
text: line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked ina
text: pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS's
scene_heading: TWO BODYGUARDS.
text: CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL
text: GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.
dialog: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations.
text: OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD
text: carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical
text: bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff.
text: The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the
dialog: bridge.
text: OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID
text: BODYGUARD'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN
text: struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the
text: DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the
text: CHANCELLOR away.
text: ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.
text: OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.
text: ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT
text: yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
text: PILOT: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.
dialog: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay on course .. . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in
dialog: orbit.
text: OBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS
text: retrieves one of the BODYGUARD'S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a
text: console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
dialog: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You lose, General Kenobi.
text: One of the PILOTS stands next to the General.
dialog: PILOT: The ship is breaking up!
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: We've run out of time.
text: OBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from
text: the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the
text: window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into
text: space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable
text: from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the
dialog: ship.
text: OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes
text: around where the window used to be.
scene_heading: 63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER
text: OBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him
text: into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him.
text: He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He
text: destroys the DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.
text: ANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of
text: butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing
text: everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the
text: DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly
text: outside the windows.
text: PALPATINE: The hull is burning up!
scene_heading: 64 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

text: ANAKIN: All the escape pods have been launched.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
dialog: ANAKIN: You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
text: ANAKIN sits in the pilot's chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break
text: away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: Well?
dialog: ANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.
dialog: Strap yourselves in.
text: OBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the

dialog: OBI-WAN: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.

dialog: if I can slow us down.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand. . .

dialog: ANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the
dialog: rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz
dialog: Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me
dialog: unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely. . .
dialog: ANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your
dialog: greatness.
dialog: OBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero

dialog: MACE WINDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?
dialog: PALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but

text: MACE WINDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.
text: PALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid
dialog: Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is

dialog: PADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.
dialog: ANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.
dialog: PADME: There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with
text: unbearable dread.
text: ANAKIN: I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it
dialog: might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would
dialog: have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
text: ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.
dialog: PADME: Wait, not here...
text: He grabs her again.
dialog: ANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're
dialog: married.
dialog: PADME: Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending
dialog: this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for
dialog: me...
dialog: ANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.
dialog: PADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my
dialog: handsome Jedi . .. Come to me later.
text: ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.
dialog: ANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?
dialog: PADME: I'm just excited to see you.

dialog: PADME: Nothing . . . nothing. . .
dialog: ANAKIN: You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!
text: PADME begins to cry.
dialog: PADME: You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so
dialog: alone. There's...
dialog: ANAKIN: ... Is there someone else?
dialog: PADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much,
dialog: Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.
dialog: ANAKIN: (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.
dialog: PADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.
dialog: ANAKIN: It's just that I've never seen you like this .. .
dialog: PADME: Something wonderful has happened.
text: They look at each other for a long moment.
dialog: PADME: (continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.

dialog: ANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything?

dialog: OBI-WAN: He would not say.
dialog: ANAKIN: He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?
dialog: OBI-WAN: All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware

dialog: ANAKIN: I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for

dialog: ANAKIN: The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?
dialog: PALPATINE: They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to

dialog: ANAKIN: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.

dialog: ANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional
dialog: amendments.
dialog: PALPATINE: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must
dialog: be won.
dialog: ANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that.
dialog: PALPATINE: Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you

dialog: ANAKIN: Of course.

dialog: OBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the
dialog: Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the
dialog: matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes
dialog: in Jedi affairs.
dialog: ANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .
dialog: OBI-WAN: But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems
dialog: to have paid off.

dialog: OBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate
dialog: situation.
dialog: ANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties.
dialog: OBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I
dialog: was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.
dialog: ANAKIN: The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.
dialog: OBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those

dialog: OBI-WAN: I hope so. . .
dialog: ANAKIN: I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is
dialog: because the Chancellor trusts you.
dialog: ANAKIN: And?
dialog: OBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.
dialog: ANAKIN: What situation?
dialog: OBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the
text: Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.
dialog: ANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!
text: OBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of
text: the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.
dialog: ANAKIN: Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
dialog: OBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach
dialog: you on this personally.
dialog: ANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched
dialog: out for me ever since I arrived here.
dialog: OBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to
text: its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.
dialog: ANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.
dialog: ANAKIN: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the

text: ANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.
dialog: PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If
dialog: they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.
dialog: ANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand.
dialog: PALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want
dialog: control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.
dialog: ANAKIN: I don't think .. .
dialog: PALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?
dialog: ANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . .
dialog: PALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.
dialog: ANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
dialog: PALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest,
dialog: didn't they?
text: ANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.
dialog: PALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?
dialog: ANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say.
dialog: PALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain
dialog: power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.
dialog: ANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good.
dialog: PALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only
dialog: valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are
dialog: considered by the Jedi to be. . .
dialog: ANAKIN: ... evil.
text: PALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost
dialog: every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the
dialog: Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.
text: ANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about
dialog: themselves.
dialog: PALPATINE: And the Jedi don't?
dialog: ANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.
text: PALPATINE smiles.
dialog: PALPATINE: Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked
dialog: you to do something you feel is wrong?
dialog: ANAKIN: I'm not sure it's wrong.
dialog: PALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A
dialog: friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of
text: assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.
text: ANAKIN is deep in thought.
dialog: PALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
speaker_heading: ANAKIN: No.
text: PALPATINE: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend.
text: Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the
dialog: Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the
dialog: dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
dialog: ANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?
dialog: PALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to
dialog: be unnatural.
dialog: ANAKIN: What happened to him?
dialog: PALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his
dialog: power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
text: everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never
dialog: saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.
dialog: ANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?
dialog: PALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.

text: YODA and various JEDI speak via hologram. The discussion includes OBI-WAN,
scene_heading: MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON.
text: KI-ADI-MUNDI: (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had
dialog: no reports of this from our agents.
dialog: MACE: (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know
dialog: nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was
dialog: there.
text: ANAKIN: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman
dialog: of Utapau.
dialog: YODA: Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly
dialog: and decisively we should proceed.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: Does everyone agree?
text: All the JEDI concur.
dialog: ANAKIN: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
text: They all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.
dialog: MACE: (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the
dialog: Chancellor.
scene_heading: KI-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.
text: ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.
dialog: YODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.
dialog: MACE: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . .. Master Kenobi.
dialog: ANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.
text: OBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.
dialog: ANAKIN: (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of
dialog: combat.
dialog: YODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.
dialog: KI-ADI-MUNDI: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.
dialog: ‘YODA: I agree.
text: All the JEDI concur.
dialog: MACE: Very well. Council is adjourned.
text: ANAKIN is angry.
dialog: MACE: (continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this

dialog: OBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you?
dialog: PADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.
dialog: OBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but
dialog: truly gifted.
text: They laugh.
dialog: PADME: You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?
dialog: OBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.
dialog: PADME: You're not very good at hiding your feelings.
text: OBI-WAN: It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a
dialog: difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I
dialog: was hoping he may have talked to you.
dialog: PADME: Why would he talk to me about his work?
text: OBI-WAN studies her.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.
dialog: PADME: Don't give me that look.
dialog: OBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you.
dialog: PADME: (nervous) What did he say?
dialog: OBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn't have to.
text: PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.
dialog: PADME: I don't know what you're talking about.
dialog: OBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried
dialog: about him.
text: PADME looks down and doesn't answer.
dialog: OBI-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed
dialog: considerably since we returned . . .
text: They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to
text: leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.
dialog: OBI-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I... [hope
dialog: I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .
dialog: PADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan.

dialog: PADME: We cannot let this turn into another war.
dialog: BAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.
dialog: MON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor
dialog: from further subverting the constitution, that's all.
dialog: PADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.
dialog: BANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous.
dialog: MON MOTHMA: We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.
dialog: PADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.
text: GiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.
dialog: PADME: The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are. . .
scene_heading: CHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator.
dialog: FANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the
dialog: Chancellor.
dialog: BANA BREEMU: When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the
dialog: Chancellor, things may change.
dialog: BAIL ORGANA: Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the

dialog: ANAKIN: You're going to need me on this one, Master.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.
text: OBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.
dialog: ANAKIN: Master!
text: OBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.
dialog: ANAKIN: (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative
dialog: of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated
dialog: with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.
dialog: OBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained
dialog: you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have
dialog: become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more
dialog: times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council
dialog: makes you a Jedi Master.
text: OBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.
dialog: OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three
dialog: systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without
dialog: your help.
dialog: ANAKIN: Well, there's always a first time.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN laughs.
text: They talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart.

text: CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this
dialog: small continent here . . . on the far side.
text: OBI-WAN: I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.
dialog: CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?
text: They laugh.
text: OBI-WAN: (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.
text: OBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.
text: CLONE COMMANDER CODY: That was Anakin who was late. I believe.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get

dialog: PALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?
text: ANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous's head.
dialog: PALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.

text: The Gungan waves to Anakin.
dialog: ANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.
dialog: JAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.
text: Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.
text: PALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is
dialog: not fit for this assignment.
dialog: ANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?
text: PALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female
dialog: Senator.
dialog: ANAKIN: That's ridiculous. Who?!?
text: PALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.
dialog: ANAKIN: That's impossible. I would know.
dialog: PALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.

dialog: PADME: He came by this morning.
dialog: ANAKIN: What did he want?
text: PADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.
dialog: PADME: He's worried about you.
dialog: ANAKIN: You told him about us, didn't you?
text: She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.
dialog: PADME: He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.
dialog: ANAKIN: And he's not?
dialog: PADME: You have been moody lately.
dialog: ANAKIN: I'm not moody. . .
dialog: PADME: Anakin! Don't do this again.
dialog: ANAKIN: I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.
dialog: PADME: Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't

dialog: ANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.
dialog: PADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.
dialog: ANAKIN: Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most
dialog: powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... | want more, and I know I shouldn't.
dialog: PADME: You expect too much of yourself.
text: They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.
dialog: ANAKIN: I have found a way to save you.
dialog: PADME: Save me?
dialog: ANAKIN: From my nightmares.
dialog: PADME: Is that what's bothering you?
dialog: ANAKIN: I won't lose you, Padme.

scene_heading: 109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY
text: OBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-

dialog: OBI-WAN: I need transportation.
dialog: WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.
dialog: OBI-WAN: Get it for me.
dialog: WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.
text: One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue.

speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: This one.

dialog: I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which
dialog: generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.
dialog: NUTE GUNRAY: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General,

scene_heading: 112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

dialog: OBI-WAN: Hello, there!
dialog: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior
dialog: bewildering . .. Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him!
text: About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS,

speaker_heading: GRIEVOUS.
text: They stare at each other for a moment.
dialog: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this.
text: The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN
text: ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-
text: WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an
text: intense fury.
text: OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the
text: BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the
text: last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN: Your move.
dialog: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku
dialog: himself. Attack, Kenobi.
text: His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing
text: display of swordsmanship.
dialog: OBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!
text: OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight
text: across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the
text: Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's
text: hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL
text: GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE
text: TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the
text: sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.
dialog: OBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.
dialog: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.
dialog: OBI-WAN: I don't think so.
text: TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns
text: blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's
text: electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He
text: falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.
scene_heading: 113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY
text: More CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS.
text: The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center.
text: OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in

dialog: PADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.
dialog: PALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.
dialog: FANGZAR: But surely. . .
text: The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.
dialog: PALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . .
dialog: committee.
dialog: PADME: On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.
dialog: PALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.
text: PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE
text: SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.
dialog: PALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is
dialog: more to their request than they are telling us.
dialog: ANAKIN: What do you mean?
dialog: PALPATINE: They are not to be trusted.
dialog: ANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .
dialog: PALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as
text: an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.
dialog: ANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken.
dialog: PALPATINE: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.
dialog: ANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.
text: PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.
dialog: PALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict
dialog: in you, Anakin.

text: CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has

dialog: have begun our attack.
scene_heading: MACE WINDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor.
dialog: His reaction will give us a clue to his

dialog: ANAKIN: Yes, Master.
text: ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears.
text: MACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds
dialog: the Chancellor.
text: KI-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of
dialog: Grievous, then he should be removed from
dialog: office.
dialog: MACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take
dialog: control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .
dialog: KI-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with
dialog: greed and corruption.
dialog: YODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hnmmmm. . . . great care we

text: ANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.
dialog: ANAKIN: Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has
dialog: engaged General Grievous.
text: PALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
dialog: ANAKIN: I should be there with him.
dialog: PALPATINE: It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate
dialog: your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?
dialog: ANAKIN: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from
dialog: the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
dialog: PALPATINE: They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your
dialog: power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the
dialog: Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
text: They walk into the hallway.
dialog: ANAKIN: How do you know the ways of the Force?
dialog: PALPATINE: My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of
text: the dark side.
dialog: They stop.
dialog: ANAKIN: You know the dark side?!?
dialog: PALPATINE: Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its
dialog: aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete
dialog: and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi,
dialog: Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.
dialog: ANAKIN: I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.
dialog: PALPATINE: Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to
dialog: know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from
dialog: certain death.
dialog: ANAKIN: What did you say?
dialog: PALPATINE: Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .
dialog: ANAKIN: You're a Sith Lord!
text: ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.
dialog: PALPATINE: I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be
dialog: a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life
dialog: greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.
dialog: ANAKIN: You're wrong!
dialog: PALPATINE: Are you going to kill me?
dialog: ANAKIN: I would certainly like to.
dialog: PALPATINE: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you
dialog: stronger.
text: ANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE's throat. There is a tense moment, then
text: ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.
dialog: ANAKIN: I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
dialog: PALPATINE: Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you?
dialog: What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?
dialog: ANAKIN: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
dialog: PALPATINE: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The
dialog: power to save Padme.
text: ANAKIN stares at him for a moment.
text: PALPATINE turns and moves to his office.
dialog: PALPATINE: (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate.
dialog: Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .

text: TROOPS from both sides.
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan's
text: LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone
text: troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.
scene_heading: 121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some
text: wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they
text: begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan's access to the General. Obi-Wan's LIZARD pulls up
text: short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.
text: OBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
text: The GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to
text: another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan's LIZARD attempts to jump to follow
text: and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.
scene_heading: 122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY

scene_heading: 123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY
text: Extending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small
text: Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS
text: race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.
text: OBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General's scooter,
text: knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol
text: and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General's electro-staff
text: and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.
text: OBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in
text: the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the
text: Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious
text: fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-
text: WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS's stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off,
text: revealing the alien life form's guts encased in a bag in the Droid's chest. GENERAL
text: GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him over his head, and tosses him across the
text: platform. OBI-WAN dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to
text: hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last second,
text: OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to retrieve the Droid's laser pistol.
text: The JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid, and he EXPLODES
text: from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to the ground. OBI-WAN has killed
text: GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the
text: destroyed carcass.
dialog: OBI-WAN: So uncivilized . . .
text: OBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform, picks up the

text: that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the
text: Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
dialog: ANAKIN: He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think

dialog: MACE WINDU: A Sith Lord?
dialog: ANAKIN: Yes. The one we have been looking for.
dialog: MACE WiNDU: How do you know this?
text: ANAKIN: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.
scene_heading: MACE WiNDU: Are you sure?
dialog: ANAKIN: Absolutely.
dialog: MACE WiNDU: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the
dialog: Jedi Order is to survive.
dialog: ANAKIN: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are

dialog: MACE WiNDU: For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of
dialog: confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
dialog: ANAKIN: I must go, Master.
dialog: MACE WiNDU: No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for

dialog: ANAKIN: I agree. The Jedi’s next move will be against the Senate.
dialog: PALPATINE: Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an
dialog: enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?
dialog: ANAKIN: I understand, Master.
dialog: PALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all
dialog: destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We

dialog: no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.
dialog: ANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?

dialog: PADME: How could this have happened?
text: ANAKIN: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take
text: advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.
text: PADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.
dialog: PADME: What are you saying?
dialog: ANAKIN: You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor
dialog: said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.
dialog: PADME: What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I
dialog: become a suspect?
dialog: ANAKIN: That won't happen. I won't let it.
dialog: PADME: Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.

dialog: PADME: (continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.
text: OBI-WAN: The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more. . .
dialog: PADME: I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is

dialog: PADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
dialog: ANAKIN: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than
dialog: any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
dialog: PADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind
dialog: while we still can.
dialog: ANAKIN: Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to

dialog: up with his old Master.
text: OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the
