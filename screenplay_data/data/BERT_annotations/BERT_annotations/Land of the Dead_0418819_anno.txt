dialog: It's hard for us here to believe
dialog: what we're reporting to you, but it

text: CLICK! In a corner of the BLACK SCREEN, A SMALL TV APPEARS.
text: On it, in BLACK &amp; WHITE, A NEWSCASTER sits at an anchor desk.
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
text: Bodies of the recently dead are

speaker_heading: SECOND NEWSCASTER
dialog: Because of the obvious threat to

dialog: remain on the air day and night.
dialog: 
text: CLICK! The second newscaster looks more and more dishevelled.
speaker_heading: SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
dialog: It has been established that persons

speaker_heading: CLICK!
speaker_heading: SECOND NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
dialog: We must not be lulled by the

speaker_heading: THIRD NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

text: IN COLOR: A FULL MOON shines over a picture-perfect American

text: SOLID VALUES. A DINER has a neon sign that offers the "BEST
text: EATS IN TOWN". But something is wrong. The neon isn't lit.
text: Nothing in town is lit. Street lamps, windows, are all dark.
text: TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICK. That DISTURBING SOUND continues.
text: Some of the PEDESTRIANS drift into "UNIONTOWN PARK", milling
text: around a GAZEBO, where THREE "MUSICIANS" are struggling with
text: a trombone, a saxophone, and a tambourine. They can't seem to
text: make the instruments work, except for the tambourine player,
text: who is rattling out a few very unrhythmic beats. That's where
text: that sound is coming from. TCHICK! KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK.
scene_heading: A CLOSER INSPECTION REVEALS: The "MUSICIANS" are DEAD. So are

dialog: 
text: ...AN ATTENDANT. It was once tall and handsome. Now his face
text: is a wrinkled map of death. He has lost its left arm. Dried
text: blood darkens the shoulder of its jump-suit, where the arm
text: was torn away. A "TEXACO" PATCH tells us the Thing used to
dialog: work here. Embroidery tells us his nickname was once "BIG
text: DADDY". He goes to the pump and removes the nozzle. Turns, as

text: Mike stands, turns, and...
text: ...is GRABBED from behind by a ZOMBIE! It's not one of the

text: Painted eyelashes make its stare alarming. Its ORANGE HAIR is
text: crawling with SPIDERS. It wrestles Mike to the ground. Opens
text: its lipsticked mouth. Is about to bite Mike's neck when...
text: ...Riley FIRES his .45. BLAM! A bullet SHATTERS the Clown's

dialog: 
text: Generators whir. Gears turn. The two men open a storage
text: locker and strap on ammo belts as...
dialog: 
text: ...SOMETHING TERRIBLE LOOMS out of the shadows! It moves
text: toward Riley and Mike, who can't see it from behind the
text: locker. The LEFT SIDE OF THE THING'S FACE has been BURNED
text: AWAY. Only scar-tissue remains, and a single usable eye
text: bulging from a socket.
text: Riley turns. Sees the thing. And, surprisingly, he relaxes,
text: recognizing CHARLIE HOUK, a heavily-armed guerilla whose
text: intellect is as burned as his face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tcha doin', Riley?
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: Havin' a bad dream.

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
text: They dumped the trash. Cholo's on
dialog: his way.
text: Riley and Mike look across the room in the direction of the
dialog: 
text: voice. Twenty feet away, a WOMAN sits at the controls of what
text: looks like a scavenged airplane cockpit that's outfitted with
text: a mixture of high- and low-tech equipment. She wears a black
dialog: 
text: leather jacket with "PRETTY BOY" emblazoned across the back.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: 
dialog: (Surprised) Pretty Boy's a dame?
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: 
dialog: This one is. Last one was a guy.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: What happened to him?
text: Pretty Boy turns, poking her finger through a BULLET HOLE
text: encrusted with year-old BLOOD in the chest of her jacket.
speaker_heading: PRETTY BOY
dialog: I kept his jacket. For good luck.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Luck?
speaker_heading: RILEY

text: a MEAN-LOOKING SNOUT. A ROOF TURRET supports two FOURTEEN
text: INCH-CANNONS. Rotating lights SHINE in all directions,
text: piercing the night.
text: THOOMB! THOOMB! THOOMB! That sound again. MORTAR TUBES on the
text: vehicle's roof are launching FIREWORKS that BURST in the sky.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (Looking up) `Flowers in the

text: BLAM! A bullet ricochets off a brick wall. Big Daddy is
text: startled at first. Then, he relaxes, realizing the rifle's
text: power. With surprising dexterity, he slings the weapon's

text: busy with the rope to notice. THE HANGED MAN'S EYES BLINK.
text: Once. Twice. Three times. Its body TWITCHES. And then...
dialog: 
text: ...the Hanged Man turns, making a move on the Young Man. The

dialog: 
text: along with the Hanged Man and his son.
text: The entire apartment is PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. The woman
dialog: 
text: stops her screaming. Almost as soon as she does, a SNARL can
text: be heard from the kitchen, followed by another SCREAM, this
dialog: one coming from the Young Man.
text: Cholo rushes to a nearby fireplace and grabs a POKER and a
text: MATCHLIGHT, which looks like a pistol, but shoots FIRE from
dialog: 
text: its tip. He approaches the kitchen, using the FLAME to light
text: his way. In the FLICKERING GLOW, he sees...
text: ...the Young Man lying on the floor. CHUNKS have been bitten
text: out of his neck and wrist. The body is CONVULSING in the last
text: moments of life. THE HANGED MAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
text: Cholo stands over the Young Man and stabs him in the head
text: with the poker, jabbing the point all the way through. The
text: woman SCREAMS again from the kitchen doorway.
speaker_heading: CHOLO
dialog: Shut up! I gotta hear. Where'd he
dialog: go? Where'd the other guy go?
text: Silence. Cholo pulls the poker out of the Young Man's head.

text: kitchen, probing the darkness with his matchlight.

text: in a staggering lampoon of a wrestling match.
text: Slack rushes to the side of the cage and starts to climb.
text: She's agile. Strong. But she almost falls as the cage SHAKES

text: BULLETS FLY, this time from a GLOCK, FIRED by...
text: ...CHIHUAHUA, who, in a rage, is pushing through the LEGS of
text: the fleeing crowd. He makes it to a clear spot and draws a

text: trigger. Riley beats him by an instant, FIRING the M-16.
text: Just as Chihuahua's gun GOES OFF...a LINE of BULLET HOLES
text: PERFORATES the little man's belly. The round from his Glock

text: ...Chihuahua's round, which misses Riley...but HITS SLACK!
text: Spun around by the impact, she falls face down.
text: Chihuahua continues to FIRE. Riley Marine-crawls as bullets
text: PUNCH around him, SPARKING off the cage. Chihuahua keeps
dialog: coming, keeps FIRING, until...

text: drops like a broken pinata.

text: He suspects she's dead. When her BODY MOVES, he suspects
text: worse. He plants the barrel of his M-16 against her temple.

text: walks toward the building.
text: He doesn't get very far before the hammer's electrical cord
text: is pulled out of the extension it's plugged into. The hammer

text: ...he looks at the building. At its doors, abandoned by

text: The barrel of an M-16 is planted against Big Daddy's temple
