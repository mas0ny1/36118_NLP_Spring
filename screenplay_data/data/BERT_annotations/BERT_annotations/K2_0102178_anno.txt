text: IN THE BACKGROUND: a MAN & WOMAN dance dirty while a hot SAX
text: blows a long blue note. VOICES & LAUGHTER OVER. Meanwhile .,.
text: IN THE FOREGROUND: a plain MAN'S WEDDING RING, suspended on a
text: long double strand of blonde HAIR, describes a counter~clockwise
text: circle in the air above a DRINKS TABLE. The improvised pendulum
text: is held by a strong MAN’S HAND. And then we hear a strong MAN'S
speaker_heading: VOICE:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/O
dialog: You're lying!
text: Stay on the PENDULUM, as its motion increases. A woman GIGGLES.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/0
dialog: What did I tell you Lisa?
dialog: There’s no point lying to
dialog: me ~ I got a million ways
dialog: of knowing.
text: TAYLOR’S RIGHT HAND drops the ring, and then goes under the table
text: and into LISA’S LAP, where it finds and grasps her left hand. Her
text: hand tries to escape, but Taylor’s holds it firmly.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/0
dialog: Your palm’s sweating ---
text: We see LISA for the first time: thirtysomething, long blonde
text: hair, bubbly but not particularly bright; a good~looking, good-
text: time party girl who has just recently digested the statistic that
dialog: awoman of her age and background has as much chance of getting
text: married as she has of being kidnapped and murdered by terrorists.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/O
dialog: You're blushing --~
text: On cue, LISA BLUSHES. Her darker, younger, more bewitching friend
text: TRACY, who sits on her right, leans across and challenges TAYLOR:
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Back off Killer! I bet
dialog: you're not exactly twenty~
dialog: one yourself.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Close. I'm forty-two,
text: TAYLOR is taut, dark and handsome ~ and doesn’t need to lie about
text: his age. The look in his biack, extrovert, adventurer’s eyes
text: alternates between piercing/compulsive and faraway/inscrutable.
dialog: 2
text: On Taylor’s left sits HAROLD. Younger than his friend, he is also
dialog: more detached, more intellectual. Unable to take so readily what
text: he wants from life, Harold watches, analyses, weighs before he
text: acts. Where Taylor’s first impulse is to seize and confront — or
dialog: to search and destroy - Harold’s is to observe and confirm.
text: HAROLD watches TRACY as he puts back on his WEDDING RING. Despite
text: his marital status, he is severely attracted to her. Harold can
dialog: tell that despite, or because of, the confrontation that Taylor
dialog: has triggered, these two girls have already decided to fuck them.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Bullshit!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I'll take that as a compliment.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Take it any way you want,
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What do you guys do anyway?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Me? I’m an explorer.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: In a suit like that? You’re an
dialog: accountant or a lawyer or some~
dialog: thing. I’ve seen you around.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I'm an accountant? Feel this.
text: TAYLOR guides LISA’S HAND up his right arm to his bicep ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Since when do accountants
dialog: have biceps like that? Huh?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Anybody can do weights.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I’m an explorer = and so is my
dialog: quiet friend here — kind of.
dialog: You ever kissed a gynecologist,
dialog: Spiderwoman?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Gimme a break! I saw that
dialog: movie.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Oh - right! And you're one
dialog: of those mutant women.
dialog: 3
text: Now TRACY, who happens to have unusually large breasts, flushes.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Never mind, he’s got just
dialog: the piece of equipment to
dialog: deal with you.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Look ~ I’m sorry about my
dialog: friend. He’s the mutant.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Shut up H and go and sit
dialog: over there next to ---
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Tracy.
text: HAROLD is uncomfortable for several reasons, and makes no move to
text: obey orders. After a few moments of inaction ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: No? Okay Tracy ~ you go and
dialog: sit next to Harold. Go on!
text: TRACY smiles ruefully, stands up nevertheless, and while
text: UNDER THE TABLE: TAYLOR’S adventurous RIGHT HAND explores the
dialog: darkest depths of LISA’S bikini zone ...,
text: TRACY very siowly moves around behind TAYLOR & LISA until she is
text: standing beside HAROLD. As he stands to her, she sits. They smile
text: obliquely at each other, and he sits again. He is very self-
text: conscious next to her; Tracy is not only sexy, but she is sending
dialog: out some very complex signals. And how Harold would love to have
dialog: the time to spend decoding them ...
text: While beside them, the intrepid TAYLOR already has his tongue
text: deep down LISA'S throat, TRACY takes shy HAROLD'S LEFT HAND, and
text: studies his WEDDING RING. They both wonder where - or if - to
dialog: start ... ~ ,
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You still in love with your wife?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yes,
scene_heading: 2_i_INT/EXT : TAYLOR’S PORSCHE - SEATTLE STREETS : NIGHT _

dialog: 
text: LISA sits up front with TAYLOR, while TRACY & HAROLD sit squashed

scene_heading: 3_i_EXT_i TRACY & LISA'S APARTMENT BUILDING : NIGHT ooo: 3
text: TAYLOR pulis up in front of a modern six-story brick APARTMENT
text: BUILDING; everybody gets out. TRACY & LISA hurry ahead towards
text: the building’s entrance, while TAYLOR & HAROLD fall in behind.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: You’1ll have to handle both
dialog: of them. I'm going home.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Iocan't do it. I’m not
dialog: going in there.
text: As they reach the door, TAYLOR & HAROLD hang back ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You cannot be serious!
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: You boys coming in or what?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah. Go on up and do what
dialog: you gotta do. We'll be right
dialog: with you. What number is it?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Sixty-eight.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Sixty-eight. Check.
text: The TWO GIRLS go through the door, which closes behind them.
text: TAYLOR smiles until the GIRLS are out of sight; then he pounces
dialog: on the hapless HAROLD:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What's the matter with you?
dialog: I let you have the best one.
dialog: That girl is heaven on a stick.
text: HAROLD is already pulling away and heading home ...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That's why I’m not going in.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (GOING AFTER HIM)
dialog: Come back here. Don’t I
dialog: look after you - on all
dialog: our adventures together?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: This is one type of adventure
dialog: I don’t do. You know that.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Fuck the rules, H.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Fuck the rules?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You gotta take risks in this
dialog: life. You stop taking risks,
dialog: you’re dead.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I start screwing around, I’m dead.
text: A WINDOW OPENS on the sixth (top) floor, and LISA & TRACY lean
text: out of it. Tainted Love PARTY MUSIC pumps out into the night ...
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: What the hell’s going on
dialog: down there?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Cool it! We're coming!
text: LISA slips back inside, but TRACY remains in the window, staring
text: down. HAROLD looks up at her; she waves (hello? goodbye?) before
text: she too slips back inside the apartment.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You're coming. I’m going. Home.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Man - we’ve got the Sex Magick
dialog: Sisters begging to fall on our
dialog: swords — and you’re going home!
speaker_heading: o HAROLD
dialog: I’11 call you tomorrow to run
text: through the equipment inventory.
text: TAYLOR shakes his head ~ and gives up trying to persuade Harold
text: to compromise himself. He shrugs, and turns towards the building.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: A candy~colored clown they
dialog: call the sandman --~
text: HAROLD is walking away when he looks back one last time
text: And sees that instead of going in through the front door, TAYLOR
text: is about to try to climb up the outside of the building!
dialog: 6
text: TAYLOR looks straight up the sheer brick facade to the GIRLS’
text: WINDOW: the window frames are almost flush, and neither are there
dialog: any pipes or other features on which to get an obvious purchase;
text: the only possibility for a solo ascent is that the pointing on
text: the brickwork is recessed.
text: TAYLOR reaches up, sinks his finger- tips into a crack at the
text: extent of his reach, and using the hard edges of his shoe soles,
text: begins to haul his way up.
text: Back on the sidewalk HAROLD, stiil watching as TAYLOR has made it
text: past the half-way mark, is approached by a plump, sweaty JOGGER
text: out on a midnight run. Seeing Harold staring upwards, the JOGGER
text: pauses to see what he’s looking at - and stops in his tracks.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: What’s that guy doing?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: He’s feeding the rat.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: He's doin’ what?!?
text: Just then TAYLOR'S foot slips as he passes a WINDOW, and he
text: accidentally kicks the glass. He is already on his way above the
text: window when the curtains fly back, and the WINDOW OPENS.
text: TAYLOR'S POV: below him, an OLD LADY sticks her head out, looks
text: around without looking up, and is about to close the window when:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/O
dialog: Boo!
text: The OLD LADY’S head jerks around and up - and she SCREAMS!
text: HAROLD'S POV: as several other WINDOWS OPEN, including that of a
text: belligerent MIDDLE-AGED MAN on the floor below the girls' window.
speaker_heading: _ TONY
dialog: - Hey Spiderman! What’s the
dialog: big fucking idea?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Just visiting some friends.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Why don’t you just jump back
dialog: down there and go through the
dialog: front door like everybody else?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Jump? Down there?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You heard me.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Fuck you man. That’s a fifty
dialog: foot drop.
speaker_heading: ' TONY
dialog: Yeah well maybe you shoulda
dialog: thought of that before you
dialog: climbed up here.
text: The crazed TONY disappears momentarily ...
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: That guy a friend of yours?
text: HAROLD nods his head distractedly ...
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: He ever do this kind of
dialog: thing before?
text: TONY reappears at the window - now toting a major HANDGUN.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Now - you want to jump like
dialog: a good boy, or you want me
dialog: to blow your fucking head off?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: LISA!! TRACY!!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
speaker_heading: (NODDING)
dialog: Every Friday night.
text: LISA & TRACY’S WINDOW flies open, and a bewildered TRACY sticks
text: her head out. TAYLOR meantime continues to climb up towards her.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Taylor! What the --- ?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: You know this guy?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I’m her accountant. One,
dialog: two, buckle my shoe --—
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It’s okay Tony.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Three, four, open the door!
text: As TAYLOR passes him on his way up, TONY pulls his head in and
text: slams his window, MUTTERING:
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Crazy fucking girls!
text: Now LISA, who has changed into a sexy dressing gown, is at the
text: window too, and together she and TRACY haul TAYLOR through into
dialog: their apartment.
text: HAROLD & the JOGGER continue to watch as TAYLOR pulls both girls
text: to him, before waving Harold goodbye - and shutting the curtains.
speaker_heading: JOGGER
dialog: What’s he do on Saturday
dialog: nights?
text: As HAROLD CHUCKLES enigmatically -=+
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK ~~~
text: Then HAROLD'S LAUGHTER SEQUES into the sound of a BABY CRYING~—~
dialog: 
text: Early one workday morning, HAROLD sits distractedly on a sofa
text: holding his CRYING one year-old son ERIC, who has distinctly
text: Asian features. Summoned from the bathroom by the sound of her
text: baby's distress, Harold's wife CINDY bustles into the modestly~
text: furnished room. CINDY ~ a feisty and wildly-attractive Japanese
text: American nurse — Jaimie Lee Curtis in a kimono — snatches ERIC up
text: to comfort him. Floating her fingers in Harold’s face:
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hello! Anyone home?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Baby’s crying, daddy.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Sorry. I was thinking.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I don’t understand how you
dialog: can sit there, with your son
dialog: screaming right in your ear,
dialog: and not even notice?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I said sorry ---
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Don’t apologize to me,
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I’m sorry Eric.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: What is there so goddammed
dialog: important to think about?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I had a flash about my work,
dialog: okay? I just realized something
dialog: incredibly obvious that I've
dialog: missed and ~~-
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Eric and I have been waiting
dialog: about a year for you to have
text: a flash about the joys of
dialog: parenthood.
text: Picking up on the continuing tension, ERIC is still erying ...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Don’t start this Cindy.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: We get one hour a day of your
dialog: valuable time, professor - if
dialog: we're lucky. I’m only asking
dialog: you ~ for one hour a day — TO
text: THINK ABOUT US.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Cindy?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: My trip’s been brought
dialog: forward by a week. That
dialog: ~ means I’11 be going the
dialog: weekend after next.
text: ERIC is quieter now; CINDY & HAROLD stare at each other for a
dialog: long, pregnant moment ...
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Okay Harold --~ 1 want to make
dialog: a deal with you. You can be a
dialog: fuck-up as a father for ten
dialog: more days, but when you get
dialog: back from this trip, I want
dialog: you to promise to concentrate
dialog: on us - the three of us — for
dialog: ~~- for six months. Okay?
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Okay ~- Cindy ~- fine -~
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: For six months you’re gonna
dialog: Be Here Now, right? No goofing
dialog: off, no trips, no —-—
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: But Cindy I've ---
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Promise me Harold. I’m serious!
dialog: Unless we can start acting like
dialog: a family, I’m gonna have to --~
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Okay, okay I promise.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: You got your fingers crossed?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: My toes.
text: CINDY comes over and kisses him and then, when she’s lulled him
text: into a sense of false security, she slips ERIC back onto his lap.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Fine. Now hold Eric for five
dialog: more minutes ’til I’m ready.

text: cu: TAYLOR - strapped into a NAUTILUS MACHINE - pouring sweat as
text: he pushes his body to its considerable limits. It is only when
text: his new p/a PAM KNOCKS and enters the room that we realize the
text: machine is set up in a corner of Taylor’s office - which commands
text: a stunning -VIEW OF PUGET SOUND. PAM is a pert, pretty puritan;
text: her immaculately coiffed hair hangs just low enough to brush the
text: string of pearls that glows against her cashmere sweater. Pam is
dialog: not Taylor’s type - and for just this reason a major challenge.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Oh! I’m sorry ---
text: Slowing his pace without altogether stopping:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: No problem. Come in.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: I wondered what that thing was.
dialog: li
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
text: Tones the tits up a treat.
dialog: You wanna try it?
speaker_heading: PAM
speaker_heading: (PURSING HER LIPS)
dialog: Mr Glicker called. He’ll be
dialog: here in fifteen minutes.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Have we got his sworn state-
dialog: ment yet?
speaker_heading: PAM
speaker_heading: (CHECKING A FILE)
dialog: Yes - it’s here.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What about his son’s?
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: That’s what he wants to
dialog: talk to you about.
text: TAYLOR nods and increases his tempo again, aware that PAM is
text: staring at him, both repelled and ~ despite herself - somehow
text: attracted. Beauty and the Beast ... Then PAM snaps out of her
text: little fairy tale moment and turns to leave ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Pam?
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Uh huh?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Dinner tonight.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Have it with me.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Oh come on!
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: I’m --- I already have a date.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Break it. Overtime.

speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Look, Mr Tarantino ---
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Taylor!
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Thanks - Mr Tarantino = but
dialog: T never shit where I eat.
text: TAYLOR clenches at this cliched defence, and jumps up two gears.
text: As PAM is turning on her heel, TAYLOR is pumping to the max
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I wasn’t aware - Ms. Perkins -
dialog: that you shat at all.
text: TAYLOR watches PAM’S perfect posterior exiting his office, and
text: then the PHONE RINGS. He whacks a button with his knee and,
text: without breaking rhythm, BARKS into the SPEAKERPHONE:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah!
dialog: 
scene_heading: AROLD’S RESEARCH LAB: DAY 0 a
text: ECU: the PUPIL of an EYE, rapidly opening and closing.
text: A wider shot reveals it to be a turtle's eyeball and optic nerve,
text: lying in a petri dish, wires running to it. Beside it, HAROLD
text: sits at an ELECTRON MICROSCOPE, a KEYBOARD in his lap and a VDU
text: on his left. Staring into the eyepiece and MUTTERING to himself:
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: As was indeed expected --~
text: He punches some data into the computer, and while he waits for

text: a VOICE in the corridor:
speaker_heading: SHERMAN V/0O
dialog: Calling Dr Spike! Calling
dialog: Dr Spike!
text: SHERMAN, another researcher who resembles a shorter "Portnoy",
text: sticks his head around Harold's door:
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Dr Spike! Emergency ego~-
text: otomy in the courtyard.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Hasselbad mouthing off again?
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: You got it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Just one more minute here -~-
text: HAROLD continues to work; SHERMAN enters the room properly and
text: comes to look over his shoulder at what he is doing ...
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: IT thought you were through
dialog: fuckin’ with turtles’ eyes?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Trenton announced he won’t put
dialog: my new grant proposal forward
dialog: until I document verifications
dialog: on everything I’ve done.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: But -= you're not some ditzoid
dialog: postgrad. That’s gotta be ~~~
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Buuuuullsssssshit! I know,

dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: It is tight ~ tight an’ juicy
dialog: for old Trenton!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What do you mean?
text: And then, the PHONE RINGS - and HAROLD picks it up. He cradles
text: the receiver between chin and shoulder and continues working .
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yeah?
text: CUT BETWEEN: HAROLD continuing to stimulate the turtle’s eyeball,
text: and TAYLOR still straining for pectoral perfection in his office:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: This is your leader.
text: HAROLD listens with interest to TAYLOR’S LABORED BREATHING,
text: giving SHERMAN a listen too.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Where the hell are you?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: In my office.
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: We all know you’re Mr Animal
dialog: Magnetism Taylor, but do you

dialog: screwing your secretary?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Nah! She’s more your type H.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I can guess. What ARE you doing?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR

speaker_heading: (HE HANGS UP, & SIGHS)
dialog: Fit enough anyway.
text: Cheerleader SHERMAN is already leading the way out of the lab...
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Make way for Dr Spike!
text: DAVE has come up behind HAROLD, and tweaks his nipples playfully.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Guess who's captain of the
dialog: other team?
text: SHERMAN springs into the air and pops a VOLLEY BALL off his
text: fingertips - making the perfect set-up for HAROLD, who leaps even
text: higher and hammers the ball over the net for a point. While
text: HAROLD & SHERMAN do a bit of victory hand jive, OTHER SCIENTISTS
text: sit at lunch tables dotted around the grassy courtyard.
dialog: 15
text: As the game continues, HAROLD finds himself across the net from
text: the opposing captain: a striking, statuesque REDHEAD whose legs
dialog: go all the way to heaven. There is an attraction between them
text: which her flirtatiousness fosters. Apart from anything else, this
text: scene establishes Harold as a believable athlete; the dialogue is
text: pursued in breathless snatches as the game continues, punctuated
text: by ORDERS barked by tall, blonde, vain CAPTAIN HASSELBAD:
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Miss Mammogram is looking
dialog: healthy these days.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Must be all the exercise
dialog: she’s getting.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What? What do you know?
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Same as everybody else -
dialog: except you, I guess.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Can’t you ever just come
dialog: straight out with it?
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Just watch out for the
dialog: politics, boy.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I don’t want "deep" here
dialog: Sherman. I just want to know

speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Trenton, fool -~— Trenton.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: a No shit?!? The old bugger! !
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: No shit - and Trenton only has
dialog: so many grants to go around.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: But ~-- Trenton’s head of
dialog: research! He'd never compromise
dialog: his professional integrity just
dialog: to score a little nookie.
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Like I keep tellin’ ya Jamison,
dialog: you are totally beautiful.
dialog: 16
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You mean dumb, don’t you?
speaker_heading: SHERMAN
dialog: Lesser despots than Trenton have
dialog: gone to great, great lengths to
dialog: possess the charms of a perfect
dialog: 10. You are vulnerable Harold.
dialog: Watch your back!
text: MISS MAMMOGRAM leaps high and thrashes one past HAROLD for a big
text: point. Her wide, white laugh swallows Harold’s hopes whole.
text: HAROLD smiles with a new kind of fearful respect at her. And if
text: she knows she is being talked about, she revels in it.
dialog: 
text: Very late that night, an exhausted HAROLD tiptoes into his
text: bedroom, dumps his bulging briefcase on the floor, and starts to
text: strip off his clothes. Just then, ERIC starts to CRY in the next
text: room, and CINDY stirs
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It’s okay - I got him Cind.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Ohhh -~ thanks darlin’.
text: As CINDY rolls over and sinks back into slumber, HAROLD smiles
text: wearily and goes through to Eric’s room next door
scene_heading: 10_i_INT_: ERIC’S BEDROOM : NIGHT 00 0000 0
text: HAROLD gently lifts ERIC out of his cot and takes him on his knee
text: on a rocking chair. ERIC immediately quietens as his father
text: begins to tell him a story:
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Once upon a time, there was
dialog: a great castle that -~ uh --
text: rose up like -- like a mighty
text: white tower above the land.
dialog: You heard this one? Me neither.
dialog: So anyway, this tower was an
dialog: inspiration to all the creatures
dialog: -- a symbol of ---- of what it
dialog: feels like when you can just
dialog: jump past all the bullshit that
dialog: gets dumped on you in this life!
dialog: You know what I’m saying Eric?
dialog: 
text: TAYLOR & HAROLD, dressed in state~of-the~art climbing gear, stand
text: on a short narrow ledge; a big, almost sheer rock wall stretches
text: up and away to their left, below and beyond which is an awesome
text: vista of glacier and distant peaks. They organize their ropes;
dialog: TAYLOR is going to lead on this pitch.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Remember ~ two pitons or
dialog: less to take the record.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I told ya H - this is now a
dialog: zero piton wall. I’m gonna
dialog: dyno the whole pitch, which
dialog: will make it forever mine.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What I love about you is you’re
dialog: too dumb to let reality stand
dialog: in the way of success.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (SEEING SOMETHING)
dialog: Gimme your glasses.
text: HAROLD hands him BINOCULARS, and TAYLOR looks up to where
text: At the furthest extent of its upward sweep, the wall curves out
text: to form a dramatic overhang, under which SIX BRIGHTLY~DRESSED
text: CLIMBERS hang in nightslings, which sway slightly in the wind,
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
scene_heading: (HANDING BACK THE GLASSES)
dialog: You believe this?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What are they doing?
speaker_heading: ~ TAYLOR
dialog: Must be some kind of ninja
dialog: cult. Ready?
text: HAROLD nods, and TAYLOR unsnaps himself and moves out onto the
text: face. Like a spider, his arms and legs stretched at bizarre
text: angles, digging his fingers into small cracks, gripping the
text: tiniest protrusions, he moves slowly out and up across the big
text: wall. Several times he has to "dyno" — leap off the wall to grab
text: another hold farther up - hanging by one hand until he can find
text: points of purchase for his other hand and for his feet.
text: While HAROLD waits on the ledge, maintaining a rather academic
text: belay, TAYLOR climbs steadily up towards the watching CLIMBERS,
text: whose faces are smeared with zine oxide.
dialog: 18
text: Closest to Taylor is Japanese-American TAKANE SHIMUZU, his broad
text: Samurai face burnt black. Next to him is PHILLIP CLAYBORN, the
text: oldest member and leader of the party. And beside him, the four
text: others: the blue-blooded DALLAS WOOLF, doughty JACK METCALFE, and
dialog: finally the twin brothers and youngest members MIKE & TODD
text: WILSON. They ail sit holding steaming tin mugs, while next to
text: TAKANE a polished METAL ORB, like some futuristic kitchen device,
text: seems to be growing right out of the wall. This too is steaming.
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
scene_heading: (TAKING IT ALL IN)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Oh? I figured sake.
text: At this point CLAYBORN removes his giare goggles, and smiles.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Hello Tarantino. Nice moves.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Clayborn!
speaker_heading: CEYEING THE ORB)
dialog: Well I always figured if
dialog: someone was gonna invent the
dialog: personal nuclear reactor, it
dialog: was gonna have to be you.
text: TAYLOR has by now moved across and below the six hanging climbers
text: to the end of the pitch, which is a narrow vertical crack that
text: runs fifty feet up to the next area of horizontal purchase. While
text: CLAYBORN does the introductions, TAYLOR deftly climbs the crack
text: until he is at the same height as the other climbers, and only
text: ten or fifteen feet along from them. While he then prepares to
text: drive in a CHOKSTONE in order to belay HAROLD for his move across
text: the face, TAKANE passes a strange-looking hi-tech PITON along the
text: line to TODD, who tosses it to TAYLOR.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: We’re testing some new
dialog: equipment.
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: It’s a gas powered, self-
dialog: driving piton. Saves a lot
text: of energy at high altitude.
dialog: 19
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (EXAMINING IT)
dialog: I hate to tell you, but we're
text: only ten thousand feet here.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Like I said ~ this is just a
dialog: test run.
text: TAYLOR shrugs, positions the PITON, and pulls the grenade~like
text: ring. There is an EXPLOSION of dust, and the piton drives itself
text: solidly home into the rock. TAYLOR nods, impressed, and clips the
text: rope linking him to Harold onto the piton. He tugs it twice asa
text: signal, then takes the tension for his climbing partner.
text: FAR BELOW: HAROLD sets out on his upward traverse.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Test run for what?
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: I'd rather not say - until
dialog: we’ve got the permissions.
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: You going to the top?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah well we got a little
dialog: rehearsal going ourselves here.
dialog: We’re coming back in a month to
dialog: shoot for the record on McKinley.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: The summit speed record?
text: TAYLOR nods nonchalantly, as he pays attention to HAROLD’S
dialog: progress ...
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: . You think you can beat
dialog: three and a half days?!?
dialog: Who else you taking?
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Superman?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Just Harold and me --—
text: The SIX CLIMBERS look at each other doubtfully ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: ~~ plus a couple of our
dialog: favorite hookers.
dialog: 20
text: Everyone LAUGHS - except the aloof, patrician DALLAS, who seems
dialog: to have conceived an immediate & violent antipathy to Taylor.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Harold who?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Harold Jamison.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Never heard of him.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Here he comes - we can ask
dialog: him he’s ever heard of you.
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: You going on up tonight?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (CHECKS HIS WATCH)
dialog: Nah ~ think we’ll save it
dialog: for tomorrow.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: We’re going to make camp just
dialog: above us here. Perhaps you’d
dialog: like to join us for the night?
text: TAYLOR watches HAROLD making good progress below him...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Why not? What time do you
dialog: chopper in the sushi?
text: At this moment HAROLD, who is almost directly below TAYLOR now,
text: tries one last dyno - and misses his mark. Taylor's efficient
text: belay means that he merely swings across the vertical in a harm-
text: less arc until he can find enough purchase to stop his momentum.
text: TAYLOR notices that DALLAS snorts derisively at this mistake.
scene_heading: 12_3:_EXT_: MOOSE’S TOOTH BASE CAMP : LATE AFTERNOON: 12
text: The EIGHT CLIMBERS make their way around a bluff on the ICE LEDGE
text: above the rock wall. The TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN, covered in deep
text: snow, towers steeply right above them. As they round the bluff,
text: they come to a narrow, acceptably-level area on the steep ice and
dialog: snow slope.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: This is about the angle of
dialog: ice they need to function on.
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: Right.
dialog: 21
text: The SIX MAN EXPEDITION immediately drop their packs and begin to
text: strip out TWO TENTS - one large, one small ~- which they clearly
dialog: intend to pitch just here.
text: TAYLOR & HAROLD look up at the mountain ~ and then at each other.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Er --~
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You guys aren’t stopping
dialog: here are you?
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: I’m stopping here,
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: We need to test these tents
text: on some steep ice.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I heard you - but this is
dialog: really a col we’re in here.
text: Some irritated looks are exchanged ...
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Catch me ~ I think I’m gonna
dialog: faint.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
scene_heading: (HELPING WITH A TENT)
dialog: It’s almost July. I’m sure
dialog: everything that’s gonna come
dialog: down has already done it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: See all those choppy formations?
dialog: There was an avalanche here just
dialog: a week or two ago - party’s
text: already over.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yeah but ~~~ we heard they had
dialog: pretty heavy snow here this year.
text: There is an uncomfortable silence, during which DALLAS pointedly
text: continues his work on one of the tents ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I think Harold’s just suggesting
text: we get out of a slide area.
text: The short-fused DALLAS instantly surrenders to a sudden and
dialog: irrational rage:
dialog: 22
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Listen, why don’t you two just
dialog: go down past that ridge on the
dialog: right and make your camp there?
dialog: We'll see you in the morning.
dialog: How’s that sound?
text: TAYLOR & HAROLD look at each other for a long moment ...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yeah ~ that's probably the best
dialog: idea. See you in the morning.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: "Course if you guys decide to
dialog: go for a real early start, don’t
dialog: forget to give us a shout.
text: DALLAS HOWLS like a wolf, the OTHERS MUTTER “goodnight” ~- and
text: CLAYBORN makes a littie conciliatory hand signal.
text: As TAYLOR & HAROLD turn and trudge away ...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Old friend?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (SHAKING HIS HEAD)
dialog: New enemy. One of my
dialog: particular talents.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What about Clayborn?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Real estate tycoon. He’s the
dialog: Donald Trump of the North West.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You climbed with him?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
scene_heading: (SHAKING HIS HEAD AGAIN)
dialog: We've done some work for
dialog: him ~~~ I see him in the
dialog: Club in Seattle sometimes.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Seems like a nice guy.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Nice? How many billionaires
dialog: do you know H?
text: As they lie back in
dialog: 23
text: their SLEEPING BAGS, the GAS LAMP still
text: burning, listening to the big country silence around them:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Ready for a big one tomorrow?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yeah - I’m feeling real good.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You'll feel even better when
dialog: we've knocked off McKinley.
dialog: Then you'll be ready for your
dialog: first eight-thousander,
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Er ~-~ Taylor?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Y-e-e-e-s?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I got a little problem about

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Oh lemme guess. It’s about

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I been working too hard, see,

speaker_heading: TAYLOR

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I really don’t think I can

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Wanna have a little side bet
dialog: on some serious white dumping
dialog: on those fuckers tonight?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: Pass. Sounds karmically uncool,
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Bullshit. We gave them a shot
dialog: at sanity. They blew it.
text: HAROLD freezes for a moment, as though listening to an inner
dialog: voice.
text: Then, he suddenly starts getting out of his sleeping bag and
dialog: finding his clothes ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Little walk. Go to sleep.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Let's see now --- High
dialog: altitude euphoria? No. Protein
dialog: deficiency? I don’t think so.
dialog: Not yet. Hereditary insanity?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: 7 Just -- go to sleep, okay?
text: HAROLD drags on his overclothes and leaves the tent ...
dialog: 
text: HAROLD picks up a long COIL OF ROPE, ties one end securely toa
text: loop on their tent, and heads back up the stark, moonlit ridge
text: towards the other tents, paying out rope as he goes ...
text: The first tent he reaches is the LARGE ONE; the light is off, but
text: there are still muffled VOICES coming from inside. Very quietly,
text: HAROLD knots the end of his rope through a tie loop on the tent.
dialog: 25
text: Then HAROLD looks across towards the SMALLER TENT, in which a
text: LIGHT still burns. He wonders what to do, since he only brought
text: one length of rope. He approaches the tent, and sees a coil of
text: rope resting against the front flap. Very gently he reaches down
text: and begins to ease the rope away from the tent ... when suddenly
text: the tent flap unzips and whips back, and HAROLD is eyeball to
text: eyeball with the suspicious TODD WILSON.
speaker_heading: TODD
dialog: You! What the fuck are you
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm --~ I was going to -~~
dialog: attach your tent to the big
dialog: one. See, I =-—
text: Now MIKE is staring out at HAROLD too; both twins clearly think
text: their visitor is completely cracked.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Did Clayborn put you up to
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No.
text: The TWINS look at each other, TODD snatches the coil of rope out
text: of Harold’s hand, and zips the tent back up in his face ...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I was just worried -- about
text: an avalanche.
speaker_heading: TODD V/O
dialog: Sure you were. ‘Night dad.
text: The LIGHT in the twins’ tent goes out and HAROLD, now feeling a
text: complete fool, shrugs and heads slowly back to his tent ...

scene_heading: 15_: EXT: MOOSE’S TOOTH SKYSCAPE_
scene_heading: 13_3_EXT. DAWN __ eS
text: High above the mountain, in the brilliant early sky, a MILITARY

text: SONIC BOOM and a second after that, a section of the summit snow
text: cap breaks away, and starts an AVALANCHE ...
text: A RUMBLING ECHO in the distance, as the avaianche gains momentum.
text: The AVALANCHE sweeps down, burying Clayborn’s TWO TENTS, and
text: sweeping them further down the mountain towards the precipice
text: above the rock wall. The ROPE linking the two tents snaps taut.
dialog: 27
speaker_heading: NOW CAVE 2 DAY 20
text: TWENTY MINUTES LATER: HAROLD & TAYLOR have tunnelled a number of
text: yards into the mound of snow when they come to the first sight of
text: the BIG TENT. HAROLD clears away more snow with his hands, then
text: uses his ice axe to rip a hole in the tent which, incredibly, has
dialog: retained some of its structure.
dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE TENT: we see a jumble of BODIES. HAROLD grabs the
text: nearest head ~ TAKANE’S, whose eyes register shock ~ and relief.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: Hey. Thanks. God --~-
text: HAROLD shines a PENLIGHT into the pile of bodies ...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Everybody else okay?

text: The four rescued CLIMBERS stand beyond the avalanche site
text: exercising life back into cramped limbs. CLAYBORN in his shock is
text: grasping a piece of his hi-tech EQUIPMENT as a kind of talisman.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: How did you find us?
text: TAYLOR picks up the ROPE, which leads from his and Harold’s tent
text: into the snow cave,
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: ~ Your idea?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Harold’s,
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: What about the other tent?
scene_heading: (TAYLOR SHAKES HIS HEAD)
dialog: We better start digging!

text: Meanwhile HAROLD is standing on the edge of the precipice,
text: looking down the thousand foot drop to the glacier below.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Hey! Look!
dialog: 28
text: HAROLD'S POV: some of the avalanche has gone over the edge and
text: dashed itself to powder on the moraine at the foot of the rock
text: wall, Just visible amidst the windblown debris is a fluttering
text: rag of the bright RED FABRIC that was the twins’ tent.
text: HAROLD turns away from the edge, distraught, just as TAYLOR &
text: CLAYBORN rush up to look over for themselves. While CLAYBORN
text: throws the useless piece of equipment over the edge ...
text: TAYLOR goes to comfort HAROLD, who is close to tears.
text: In the LOUNGE of the ALPINE CLUB, with its atmosphere of the
dialog: tradition of pioneering in this prime wilderness region of the
text: USA, PHOTOGRAPHS of intrepid climbers line the wood-panelled
text: walls. In the doorway, we see two grizzled summit VETERANS greet
text: each other with some arcane, private~joke hand signal; then they
text: immediately fall to reminiscing about some high altitude epic.
text: Meanwhile TAYLOR sits with CLAYBORN over a drink. While the older
text: man looks very business-like in his rather severe suit, TAYLOR
text: dresses as usual more flamboyantly.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I guess it leaves kind
dialog: of a hole in your team.
text: CLAYBORN deflects this challenge with his best poker face.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Got anyone in mind to fill it?
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: You’re volunteering, huh?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Depends on where you're going.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Could be just about anywhere.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: “Waiting for permission" means
dialog: the Himalayas.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Not necessarily. We might be
dialog: going ski trekking in the Urals.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Oh come on Clayborn, it’s one
dialog: of the big ones. You wouldn’t
dialog: be in it otherwise.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN gazes
dialog: 29g
text: noncommittally out the window at one of his
text: mirror-glass SCRAPERS that towers above them ...
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: I never talk about a deal

speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
scene_heading: (TAYLOR IS VERY WARM)

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I’m the best climber I know

speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: So what’s stopping you?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: The big ones take time. I’ve
dialog: never given myself that time,
dialog: But I’m not getting any younger
dialog: here, and this just seems right.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: You haven’t told me WHY I should

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I’ve climbed with Harold fifteen
dialog: years. We're good together, and
dialog: we’re hungry. You need two guys.
dialog: Why NOT take us?
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Maybe I just don’t like having

dialog: Three weeks.

scene_heading: 252 INT : OUTSIDE TRENTON’S OFFICE : DAY 00000: 25
text: TAYLOR is about to barge straight through Trenton’s door ~ which
text: also has a glass panel in it ~ when HAROLD grabs his arm.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Wait! Look!
text: IN TRENTON'S OFFICE: TRENTON sits at his desk while our favorite
text: femme fatale lays out a series of large format MAGNETIC RESONANCE
text: IMAGES - high-definition color x-rays - on a LIGHTBOX.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Who is that?!?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Miss Mammogram! I told you -=
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: She's looking for a grant?
dialog: How much does she need?
dialog: I'll give it to her.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Everybody wants to give
dialog: it to her.
text: Then, before HAROLD can restrain TAYLOR, he KNOCKS on Trenton’s
text: door, and enters the office, HAROLD following him in an attempt
text: at damage limitation. TRENTON & the REDHEAD look up in surprise.
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: Harold! What ~~? Who is this?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Taylor Tarantino. I’m Harold’s
dialog: attorney.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: _ Taylor!
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Sorry to barge in Professor.
dialog: My idea. We need an answer
dialog: on Harold’s grant.
text: TRENTON looks daggers at HAROLD, then:
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: Will you excuse us Ms Kurstow?
dialog: This won't take a minute.
dialog: 37
text: The REDHEAD smiles and leaves the room, TAYLOR'S eyes following
dialog: her. When she has gone:
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: Now what the hell is this
dialog: all about?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I need Harold’s participation
dialog: in something very important on
dialog: the twenty-third. I figure you've
dialog: already decided about his grant so
dialog: --~ is he going to get it or not?
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: How did you get past my secretary?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Same way I get past all bullshit:
dialog: I jump over it. Now come on - we’re
dialog: talking about Harold's future here.
dialog: What’s it going to be?
text: TRENTON is standing now, He picks up a copy of HAROLD’S THESIS;
text: CU: HAROLD’S NAME on the cover - flicks through it, and dumps it
text: wistfully back on the desk.
text: Now TAYLOR picks it up and examines it ...
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: This is a good piece of work
dialog: Harold. A very good piece of
dialog: work. Better than the study
dialog: that clinched my professorship
dialog: I should say --- what we call
dialog: “pure research" Mr Tarantino.
text: TAYLOR looks at HAROLD significantly.
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: - But that was twenty years ago.
dialog: When there was such a thing
dialog: as a free lunch in these dumps.
text: Now TRENTON is handling some of the Redhead's M.R. IMAGES ...
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: These Magnetic Resonance
text: Images of Ms Kurstow’s are
dialog: examples of applied research.
dialog: The university is negotiating
dialog: an R and D contract for this
dialog: technology with --~ a large
dialog: company, worth up to a hundred
dialog: million dollars to us over the
dialog: next ten years.
dialog: 38
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: So the answer’s no.
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: Very reluctantly. I have no
dialog: choice Harold.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: But without "pure" research,
dialog: you've got nothing to apply.
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: This is a smal! faculty. We
dialog: are not well endowed. We have
dialog: to be realistic.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I call it short-sighted. You
dialog: want me to do an appendix on
dialog: future applications of my work?
speaker_heading: TRENTON
dialog: You came in here demanding an
dialog: immediate answer. You’ve got it.
speaker_heading: (INTO INTERCOM)
dialog: Ms Kurstow may come back in now.
speaker_heading: (TO HAROLD: )
dialog: You’re one of the best research
dialog: scientists I know Harold. I’1l
dialog: give you all the help I can to
dialog: find another posting. I’m sorry.
text: MS KURSTOW reenters the office. She smiles at HAROLD with a sad,
text: serene inevitability ~ like a scientist looking at a beautiful-
text: but-doomed dinosaur. She offers hima “no hard feelings" hand-
text: shake, but TAYLOR grabs HAROLD'S arm and pulls him to the door.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Come on H ~ we're out of here.
dialog: Thanks Trenton.
scene_heading: 26_1_INT/EXT : SEATTLE STREETS : EVENING ot 26

text: HAROLD talking mute as they drive down quiet suburban streets,
text: past MEN watering lawns after work, KIDS playing basketball
text: against garage doors, WOMEN cooking dinner in brightly-lit
text: kitchens with the TV on for company. Then:
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It’s a matter of perception.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: It’s a matter of evolution.
dialog: 39
text: As they enter HAROLD'S STREET ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Look out here --~ you see people
dialog: happy at home with their families
dialog: --~ I see people who've given up
dialog: fighting for existence. That's
dialog: what I call living dangerously.
scene_heading: 27:_INT/EXT: TAYLOR'S PORSCHE OUTSIDE HAROLD’S HOUSE: EVENING: 27

text: As TAYLOR pulls up outside HAROLD’S HOUSE:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You want me to come in?
text: HAROLD looks at the lighted windows of his home
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: One thing I’m still capable
dialog: of is doing my own talking.
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: So I can call Clayborn?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (BEAT) Yeah. Call him.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You sure you don’t want me to
dialog: wait? Til you’ve talked it over.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Get out of here.
text: They do their blood brothers handshake, HAROLD gets out of the

scene_heading: 28 INT: HAROLD & CINDY’S LIVING ROOM : NIGHT 328
dialog: 
text: HAROLD enters the living room, to see a delighted ERIC erawling
text: quickly across the floor towards him, and CINDY, still in her
text: uniform, just beginning to prepare dinner.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Hi Eric. Hi Cind.
text: He picks ERIC up, and then goes to kiss CINDY. She seems relaxed,
text: happy, and very pleased to see him.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hello darling. Good day?
dialog: 40
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Er -- fine. You started on
dialog: something there? I thought
dialog: we might go out for dinner.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Oh! Really? Sure - that’d be
dialog: neat. I'11 go change.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Can I watch?
text: CINDY winks at him and leads the way into their bedroom
dialog: 
text: CINDY, wearing only bra and panties, stands making herself up in
text: the big mirror that faces the foot of their double bed, on which
text: she can see HAROLD playing rough and tumble with ERIC.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Where we gonna go?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Your choice.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: How about the Vietnamese?
dialog: They're great with Eric.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Vietnamese. Fine.
text: CINDY has just started applying her lipstick when she happens to
text: glance at her husband, and there is something about the wistful
text: expression on his face as he plays with his son that stops her in
dialog: mid~stroke.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: What is it H?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Something’s wrong.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Nothing’s wrong.

speaker_heading: LSD
dialog: 
text: MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT: HAROLD & CINDY are lying naked under a
text: sheet in the dark when ERIC makes a small NOISE from his cot in
text: the adjoining room. CINDY is asleep, but HAROLD is wide awake and
text: is about to get out of bed when ERIC quietens again.
text: HAROLD lies on his back with his eyes open now, clearly tense. He
text: turns away from CINDY onto his side, and is about to slip out of
text: bed when CINDY stirs ...
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: What is it H?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Can't sleep.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Dunno.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Yes you do.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I’m just going to get a
dialog: drink of water.
speaker_heading: CINDY
speaker_heading: (PULLING HIM BACK)
dialog: Tell me what’s the matter first.
dialog: You’ve been weird all evening.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Look I just want to --—
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Tell me!
speaker_heading: ~ HAROLD
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I made you a promise Cind.
dialog: (TWO BEATS) I want to break it.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Another mountain!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Uh huh.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: But you said six months. You
dialog: promised! You haven’t been
dialog: home six days!
dialog: 42
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Things’ve changed. Everything's
dialog: different,
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Like what? Am I different?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: You don’t love me anymore?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No ~~ yes! Of course I still
dialog: love you.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: You in love with somebody else?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Well what then?!?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: We've been asked to go to K2.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It’s the chance of a lifetime.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: The chance of a lifetime to get
dialog: yourself killed!
text: CINDY is out of bed now, raging naked around the room in the near
text: -darkness. Beside the bed on Harold’s side is a BOOKSHELF, on
dialog: which are a number of books, mostly about mountain climbing. She
text: grabs several of them up, cracks them open, rips pages out ...
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I've looked at these books H.
dialog: “Savage Mountain" -- "Killer
dialog: Mountain" -~ half the people
dialog: who go to K2 don’t come back!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: K2’s not --- guys get killed
dialog: on all kinds of mountains.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: But why do you want to die?
dialog: 43
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I don’t want to die.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Then why the hell do you do it?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I do it to feel alive!
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Thanks very much!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Cindy shut up and listen!
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: You want to blow five years
dialog: of work ~- your grant -- just
dialog: so's the Italian Stallion can
dialog: use you as his stooge again -~
text: The grain of truth in this stings HAROLD hard, and he bangs his
text: raging woman against the wall, stunning her momentarily.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I’m NOT his stooge! I’m doing
dialog: this mountain for ME!
speaker_heading: CINDY
scene_heading: ME-ME~ME-—ME--ME~ME~ME-—ME-ME-ME !
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Cindy I lost the fucking grant!
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: WHAT? !?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I lost my grant. It won’t be
dialog: renewed. Finito. As of two
dialog: ~ weeks time, I’m out of there.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Well thanks for telling me.
text: She slaps him very hard across the face. Still feeling guilty for
text: having pounded her, HAROLD wants the punishment.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: Everything’s falling apart.
dialog: And now this has come up --~
speaker_heading: CINDY
speaker_heading: (SLAPPING HIM AGAIN)
dialog: And now THIS has come up!
dialog: How inconvenient, huh?
speaker_heading: 44
text: Now it is HAROLD’s turn to lose all control and rage around the
text: room, throwing and smashing things ...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You or the mountain, is that it?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Me or the mountain.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Well I’m going to have both!
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: We won't be here when you
dialog: get back! If you get back.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Then I’11 come and find you,
dialog: wherever you are, and we'll
dialog: start all over, and know how
dialog: to do it right.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
text: CINDY is SCREAMING; HAROLD chases her round the room and grabs
text: her; she kicks and struggles; he forces her onto the bed; first
text: they fight, then they fuck.
text: IN THE NEXT ROOM: ERIC listens to the new SOUNDS with interest.
dialog: 
text: CU: ERIC’S little face through the back-window of his parents’
text: car as he watches:
text: ERIC’S POV: the line of MEN’S FACES lining the curved DEPARTURE
text: RAMP as the car is about to pull away. Beside his father is
text: TAYLOR. His mother, who is driving the car, stares at TAYLOR as
text: she starts the car; a look that says something passed between
dialog: these two people once that had nothing to do with Harold.
text: As the CAR PULLS AWAY, HAROLD watches ERIC’'S uncomprehending face
dialog: vanishing ...
dialog: 
text: CU: HAROLD’S FACE reflected on the inside of a PLANE WINDOW as he
text: looks out at the high altitude CLOUDS ...
dialog: 45
text: HAROLD looks back across the aisle: TAKANE lies back listening to
text: a Dwight Yokum tape on his WALKMAN. Beside him, JACK METCALFE
text: painstakingly checks through lists of expedition equipment. In
text: the window seat in front of JACK sits CLAYBORN in his half-frame
text: glasses, reading some weighty historical tome, which he annotates
text: with an expensive propelling pencil.
text: A little further forward, TAYLOR stands in the aisle chatting up
text: JODI the STEWARDESS; he already has her GIGGLING ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Really -- the point of all
dialog: this is for the six of us to
dialog: join the five mile high club.
speaker_heading: (JODI GIGGLES AGAIN)
dialog: You a member?
speaker_heading: JODI
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Come on — you can tell me.
speaker_heading: JODI
dialog: I did. I’m not.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Well -- wanna do something
dialog: about it?
dialog: Now JODI is a brave girl, but not that brave.
speaker_heading: JODIE
dialog: You’re too much, you know?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: No - come on! This is first
dialog: class, isn’t it? Help me out
dialog: here.
text: CLAYBORN is watching now, thin lipped, when DALLAS comes back
text: down the aisTe from the toilets and sees the repulsively rampant
text: TAYLOR on the make. A disapproving iook immediately clouds his
text: face, and as he passes TAYLOR, he purposely bumps him hard.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Sorry if our mascot is giving
dialog: you a hard time, Miss.
speaker_heading: JODI
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: He gets altitude sickness, see,
dialog: and he just can’t help himself.
dialog: 46
text: While TAYLOR mimes vomiting over DALLAS, and the two men relapse
text: into an angry standoff, JODI takes the chance to slip away.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Dallas!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Thanks buddy ~- owe you one.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Don’t mention it.
text: As DALLAS goes to slip back into his seat beside CLAYBORN, TAYLOR
text: passes behind him, and knocks him so hard that he falls clumsily
text: across their leader, who drops his book on the floor.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Will you two knock it off?
text: TAYLOR turns and makes a flamboyantly innocent “Who me?" gesture
text: before collapsing in the aisle seat beside HAROLD.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I thought you were already
dialog: a member?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You get addicted, you know.

dialog: We also notice the expedition’s army-attache Liaison Officer
text: MALIK negotiating with the shifty IBRAHIM, the head porter and
dialog: Urdu-Balti translator (sirdar).
text: Beyond this hectic scene: the long valley, entirely ringed by the

text: veiled women and filthy naked children - turn out to line the
text: read and stare at the strangers. The village is surrounded by
text: vivid green agricultural terraces, ploughed by Yaks and won from

text: The CONVOY lurches towards a large flat area just beyond the

text: a noisy negotiation with representatives of the PORTERS, the rest
text: of whom take the opportunity to pray; hundreds of them kneel in
text: the dust facing Mecca.
text: TAYLOR finds a FRISBEE in his pack, and tosses it to HAROLD. He
text: in turn tosses it to TAKANE, who tries an ambitious blind whip to
text: DALLAS. This eludes him, arcing around to hit one of the praying
text: PORTERS on the bottom; the astonished man leaps up in alarm, as
text: though Allah himself had kicked his ass. Other porters hoot with
text: LAUGHTER, one of them grabs the fluorescent disk, and soon there
text: is a full-on East-West frisbee free-for-all in the dusty camp.
text: Meanwhile: CLAYBORN is still negotiating. He speaks to MALIK

dialog: through ever—poorer and smaller villages.
text: In one VILLAGE we see HAROLD acting as team doctor, inspecting
text: and dispensing colored pills to a long queue of poorly-nourished
text: and even deformed VILLAGERS. We also see a bitter mute argument
text: between CLAYBORN, MALIK, IBRAHIM and a number of the PORTERS.
dialog: On one long ascent we get a hint of competitiveness between

scene_heading: The DESCENDING EXPEDITION is a SIX-MAN GERMAN CLIMBING PARTY.
text: They are accompanied by a small group of BALTI PORTERS, four of
text: whom carry a STRING BED, on which is the body of ANOTHER MAN.
text: Bringing up the rear is a pretty, distracted~looking young
text: ITALIAN WOMAN. They all look like they've been through hell.

text: While CLAYBORN nods ‘of course’, HAROLD looks at the sick man,

text: to MURMUR to her husband in Italian, withdraws to the main group.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: He’s dead!
speaker_heading: STEINER

text: In the sulphurous gloom below them, HAROLD is amazed to see
text: WOMEN, CHILDREN & ANIMALS moving around a cooking fire.
dialog: 51
text: Behind HAROLD, next to the main entrance, TAYLOR chats quietly,
text: and respectfully - in ITALIAN ~- with the teary young WOMAN.
text: Back in the main group: the diplomatic DALLAS is doing best of
text: all with the revolting yak-butter cocktails when he spots TAYLOR
text: apparently woolfing the widow, and subtly draws CLAYBORN’S
text: attention to it. He then makes a derogatory comment to TAKANE.
text: TAYLOR notices this bait, but continues to talk to the WOMAN in
dialog: exactly the same manner, even going so far as to touch her sleeve
text: in a gesture of sympathy.
text: DALLAS takes a step forward, and makes another comment, still
text: inaudible. TAYLOR continues to ignore him; now the grieving WIDOW
text: is swooning provocatively on his shoulder.
text: CLAYBORN watches the prelude to the shootout nervously, but the
text: LAMBARDAR has him well and truly boxed in; he only gets to hold a
dialog: party once a year, and he intends to make the most of it.
dialog: Then DALLAS ~ who affects the code of conduct of a Southern
text: Gentleman circa Scarlett O’Hara and thinks he knows a cad when he
dialog: sees one ~ can stand it no longer:
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Taylor!
text: TAYLOR nods "a moment please" - in fact he has been conducting
text: himself with perfect Etruscan decorum ~ excuses himself further
text: with a soft, familiar PHRASE, and goes to meet his match.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: What the hell do you think

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I’m talking to Signora Giustetta.

text: CLAYBORN notices all this and signals diplomatic alarm. TAKANE
text: intercepts the signal and is the first to move ...

text: TAYLOR & DALLAS wrestling seriously. Now Dallas is no pushover;
text: he has the physical pedigree of a well-bred Ivy League quarter-

text: Nevertheless, TAYLOR had the element of surprise, and is soon
text: mooshing his enemy’s face into the dust. He hisses into his ear:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I’tl tell you what my thing
dialog: is, Woolf. My thing is to
dialog: climb this fucking mountain.
dialog: If you’re on my rope while
dialog: I’m doing it, I'll fight for
dialog: your life. But I hope one day
dialog: you’re not on my rope, and you
dialog: fail off the fucking mountain.
dialog: ‘Cos when you do, I’1ll be there
dialog: Woolf, and my thing at that point
dialog: will be absolutely for fuckun’
dialog: definite to piss on your grave.
text: Now TAKANE is at hand, hauling TAYLOR off; CLAYBORN arrives too.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: You idiots!
text: The LAMBARDAR and the BALTI VILLAGERS look on at this fascinating
dialog: floorshow, and wonder what these strange visitors will get up to
dialog: next?
text: The OTHER CLIMBERS gather too, and while TAKANE continues to hold
text: the TWO panting MEN apart, CLAYBORN reads them the riot act:
dialog: 53
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: One more of those, and you'll
dialog: both spend the rest of the
dialog: trip packhorsing. If you can’t
dialog: behave like men, I’1l treat you
dialog: like animals. We’re here - this
dialog: is it! From now on we’re a team,

dialog: Jesus! Big one here.

text: together in teams of five or ten for safety - snakes its way up
text: the frozen river of ice towards its goal.
text: Each of the climbers leads one of the roped groups. We see
text: CLAYBORN - first among equais - striding out in front of his
text: party, urging them to make more than their naturai pace. Near
text: him, TAKANE & DALLAS seem to be in competition; everyone is keen
dialog: to impress with his fitness and determination in order to
dialog: maximize his chances of being chosen for the summit team. Perhaps
dialog: even MALIK harbors summit ambitions?
text: TAYLOR & HAROLD urge their respective teams along in parallel,
text: ignoring MUMBLES of protest from the PORTERS struggling along
dialog: behind.
text: Suddenly one of HAROLD'S TEAM stumbles and falls, causing his

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Hey! What's the big hurry?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
text: Devil takes the hindmost, boyo.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Wait!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR

text: While the STARS twinkle in the brilliant sky above, everyone
dialog: looks exhausted but happy. Life is good; this is what it’s all

text: of PORTERS forward into the gathering storm,

dialog: 
text: The party struggles to erect their tents in the teeth of a fierce

text: over the storm. They are both whacked.
text: LATER: they sit snug in their sleeping bags, reading. We HEAR the

dialog: "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu: Confucius meets Machiavelli.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I never read that.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
scene_heading: (HOLDING UP THE BOOK)
dialog: It’s good on strategy. "When you

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: "People on dying ground are, as

text: HAROLD listens to the fierce WIND roaring across the tent fabric.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You got your strategy figured
dialog: out, H?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I dunno -— What do you mean?
scene_heading: (HANDING THE BOOK BACK)
dialog: What’s your strategy?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Mine is mine. Question is --
dialog: what’s yours? No one else can
dialog: climb the mountain for you, H.
dialog: 56
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I know that! What are you
dialog: trying to say? It’s every man
dialog: for himself from here on in?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: If it comes to that, you've got
dialog: to be able to deal with it, sure.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Any rules at all? Would you draw

dialog: flesh? Mine for instance?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Anything can happen up here H,
dialog: You can’t rely on anybody but
dialog: yourself. That’s all I’m trying
dialog: to say.
text: HAROLD looks thoughtful, even a little troubled, as he turns away
text: from TAYLOR and listens to the gale. FADE TO BLACK --~
text: TAYLOR opens his eyes. The storm has died, and the terrible sound
text: of the wind is replaced with ... total silence. Then he notices
text: that the tent is buried by a snowdrift; the ceiling sags down,
text: and the light is diminished.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: H! We're snowed in.
text: But HAROLD’s sleeping bag is empty. TAYLOR drags off his bag and

dialog: particular direction ...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Okay - open your eyes.
text: CU: TAYLOR’S FACE, as he opens his eyes - to be confronted by the
dialog: most impressive collection of mountains anywhere on earth. This
text: camp at Concordia is at the confluence of two mighty glaciers;
text: these two monstrous rivers of ice are effortlessly dominated at
text: this point by Broad Peak, Mitre Peak, Mustagh Tower, plus the
text: four Gasherbrums and their satellites.
text: Now TAYLOR turns to the left, and looks up the Godwin Austen
text: GLACIER, where he sees a new mountain of truly appalling height.
text: Its beautifuliy proportioned pyramid fills the whole end of the
dialog: valley, and even at this most spectacular place on earth, there
dialog: is simply nothing else to look at.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: K2.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Fuck me!
text: The others stamp around pointing out the glistening peaks to each
text: other. They all know unequivocally in this instant why they are
text: here. This is Real Life, and everything else pales in comparison.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Everybody feeling all right?
speaker_heading: (EVERYBODY IS)
dialog: Good - because there’s no

dialog: make Base Camp tonight.
dialog: No good reason that is.

speaker_heading: MALIK

speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Come on everybody. Last day.
dialog: Then we’re on the mountain.
text: The AMERICANS struggle into their packs for the last stage of the

scene_heading: GODWIN AUSTEN GLACIER : DAY.

text: The expedition is strung out in a long line with the AMERICANS at
text: the front. Suddenly the BALTIS start to knot up and slow down,
text: and IBRAHIM - who as usual is the only one not carrying anything
text: at all - runs forward to find MALIK. And then MALIK struggles
text: back up the line to find CLAYBORN. The Liaison Officer's grim

speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Don’t tell me.
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: They want to rest.

speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: They say it’s too dangerous.
dialog: Deep snow ~~ many crevasses --
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: What will camping here prove?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: It’ll prove that they get an

speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: We’re going on to Base Camp to~

speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: They will not move Sahib.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: We'll see about that.
text: CLAYBORN, followed by TAYLOR, DALLAS & MALIK, move down the line
dialog: to have it out with the ringleaders ...
text: They are confronted by an angry, menacing MOB, who wave sticks
text: and seem in no way intimidated by the white mens’ status as their
text: employers. After much pushing, shoving and SHOUTING, a lot of
text: which is done by TAYLOR, one of the BALTIS actually throws a
text: punch, which momentarily decks TAYLOR.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: The ego has landed!
text: Stung as much by this comment as by the blow, TAYLOR leaps to his
text: feet and fights his way back to the particular PACK where their
text: stash of RUPEES is hidden.
text: Returning to the fray, TAYLOR grabs out a fistful of the low
text: denomination BANKNOTES, and right under the horrified noses of
text: the BALTI RINGLEADERS, sets fire to the money.
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: Stop!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Tell them they don’t want the
dialog: money we've already agreed on,
dialog: I’il burn the fucking lot. Tell
dialog: them that!
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: Stop! You must not do this!!
text: But it’s too late, and the SHRIEKING BALTIS shrink back from this
text: appalling act, which clearly establishes TAYLOR as a dangerous
dialog: lunatic.
dialog: 60
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Ten bucks worth ~~ big deal!
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: Ten dollars will feed one of
dialog: their families for six months!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: That’s what I call cost-effective.
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: You do not negotiate with them by
dialog: destroying what they do not have.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You know a better way? So far
dialog: i haven't seen it,
text: TAYLOR holds the BAG OF MONEY high for all to see and forges to
text: the front of the line ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Come and get it before it’s
dialog: too late.
text: The expressions on the faces tell us that TAYLOR has won the
text: round but not the fight. We also see that MALIK remains as
text: appalled and insulted as the Baltis at what Taylor has done.
scene_heading: 30_:_EXT_: ICE FALL - GODWIN AUSTEN GLACIER : DAY _ i

text: followed DALLAS’ GROUP across an ICE BRIDGE over a huge CREVASSE
text: in the glacier, when HAROLD looks back to the NEXT GROUP. This is
text: led by MALIK, who makes the mistake of looking into the abyss, &
text: freezes in the middle of the bridge. Calling forward to DALLAS:

speaker_heading: WOOLF!
speaker_heading: (DALLAS TURNS AROUND)
dialog: I’m gonna tie onto the
dialog: Malik’s group. Take mine
dialog: on will you?
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Yeah - okay.
text: HAROLD detaches himself from his group of PORTERS and attaches
text: them to the end of DALLAS’ group, before turning back to help the
text: stranded group. MALIK is still paralysed by fear ~ the crevasse
text: appears to be hundreds of feet deep ~ when there is suddenly a
text: great splintering SOUND --~ and the BRIDGE begins to collapse!
text: MALIK miraculously finds his feet again ~~~
dialog: 61
text: MALIK runs towards HAROLD'S side of the bridge, leaps the last
text: few feet, lands on his belly, and slams his AXE into the ice in a
text: classic "safety" ... moments before the PORTERS on the other end
text: of the rope disappear SCREAMING into the crevasse ...
text: We see the incredible strain on MALIK'S face - and we also see
text: the strain on the AXE with the weight of the others on it, as it
text: begins to cut a path through the ice...
text: While HAROLD is sprinting back towards MALIK ... DALLAS, TAYLOR &
text: TAKANE are untying from their groups and running back too.
text: Fractions of a second before MALIK slips over the edge to his
text: certain death, HAROLD reaches him, slams the heels of his
text: crampons into the ice, grabs the top of MALIK’S AXE, and sits
text: back in a seated belay. He manages to postpone the tragedy, but
text: then the AXE starts to cut through the ice again. Moments before
text: both of them are pulled over the edge ...
text: DALLAS clips a rope through MALIK’S HARNESS, then SCREAMS at
text: TAYLOR & TAKANE who are bringing up the rear:
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: SAFETY!!!
text: TAYLOR & TAKANE immediately loop the rope around their axes,
text: drive them into the ice, and fall on them in the “safety”
text: position. DALLAS races back from the edge and does the same.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
speaker_heading: (TO HAROLD)
dialog: LET GO!!
text: HAROLD releases _the axe ~ and MALIK SCREAMS as he drops over the
text: edge of the crevasse. The rope, held by DALLAS, TAYLOR & TAKANE,
dialog: snaps taught ... and holds!
text: MALIK'S POV: the OTHER PORTERS dangling SCREAMING below him in
text: the black, bottomless crevasse.
text: As CLAYBORN, JACK and groups of the other PORTERS arrive, they
text: help haul the line of PORTERS out of the abyss, into which many
text: of the other BALTIS stare, mesmerized. Finally, all the men stand
text: safely back on firm ice, very glad to be alive. Everyone else
text: gathers around to slap the hard~-breathing HAROLD on the back;
text: they all share a moment of elation. Harold has done it again!
speaker_heading: DALLAS

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We camping here or what?
text: CLAYBORN surveys the PORTERS actions and mood, and decides that
dialog: maybe they have all had enough for one day after all.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Coming in Woolf?
text: DALLAS continues to stare - but then he turns away, as if
text: listening to some disturbing SOUND.

text: they hear CLAYBORN SHOUTING
text: BACK AT THE TENT: HAROLD is just emerging when he hears the
text: SHOUTING too, and hurries towards the voices ...
text: HAROLD looks back down the glacier towards Concordia - to see
text: large groups of PORTERS, many of them carrying their packs of
text: FOOD, heading for home. While MALIK dogs the heeis of one group,
text: SHOUTING, IBRAHIM is running around ARGUING too, and looking very
text: worried. Meanwhile more and more PORTERS are dumping their loads

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What’s the matter? Just a few
dialog: more hours and we’re there!
text: There is a hint of recognition, and even regret in the PORTER’S
text: EYES - but he nevertheless pulls away and keeps walking. HAROLD
text: tugs at his sleeve and keeps TALKING to him —~ the porter doesn’t
dialog: understand a word of English - but the plea has no effect whatso-—
text: ever, and HAROLD is reduced to standing on the glacier watching
text: the disgruntled, deserting men streaming all around him...

scene_heading: BACK IN THE ICE-WATER BATH: Even in this emergency, TAYLOR’s

text: They arrive to see that the dispirited HAROLD, MALIK & IBRAHIM
text: are already returning to CAMP - without the porters. About

speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Because if you get frostbite,

text: HAROLD is looking up at THE SUMMIT looming straight above them.
text: The faceted sheer walls of ice and granite glint in the sunlight.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah! We all get an equal

speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Based on fitness ~ right!

text: the OTHER PORTERS ferry loads.
text: We watch them pass us at a certain point; so far they all seem ta
dialog: be working well, although already the altitude (20,000') is

scene_heading: 56: EXT : CAMP ONE _: DAY. i_56

text: DALLAS & TAKANE reach an area of flattened ridge, look at each

text: the astonishing view - from here they can see all the way back
text: down the glacier to the CONCORDIA CAMP - the next pairing of
text: TAYLOR & HAROLD heave themselves up the last slope to Camp One.
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: We’1l make this Camp One.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Okay by you guys?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Jesus! Fine by me.
text: HAROLD nods agreement, then looks back down the rope ... to where

speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: Clayborn'’s struggling a bit.
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: He always takes a few days to
dialog: acclimatize. He’1l be okay.
text: TAKANE is already putting on the STOVE to melt some snow for hot
dialog: drinks ...
text: And by the time CLAYBORN & JACK haul themselves up to the camp,
text: the drinks are ready; TAKANE passes them around, but HAROLD
text: refuses his. Everybody turns on him in unison:

speaker_heading: CLAYBORN

speaker_heading: DALLAS
speaker_heading: (TO TAKANE)
dialog: You want to lead today?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: i want to lead today.
text: DALLAS looks at TAYLOR then at TAKANE ~ and then up the mountain:
text: Immediately above them, a vertical ICE CHIMNEY stretches several
text: hundred feet, after which it appears to plateau out. Checking
text: that CLAYBORN is out of sight:
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: First one to the top leads
dialog: today.
text: TAYLOR grins, HAROLD gulps ... and before anyone has more time to
text: think about it, they are all four of them hacking up the chimney
text: in a frenzy of axes, crampons and flying ice.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TOP OF ICE CHIMNEY : DAY
dialog: 
text: Before we can see the climbers we can HEAR their approach ...
text: Finally an ice axe and ice hammer stab into the lip of the ledge,
text: followed immediately by two more sets of axes and hammers. The
text: climber belonging to the first set pops his head over the lip. It
text: is TAYLOR. While he hauis himself over the lip, DALLAS & TAKANE’s
text: heads appear, and moments later, HAROLD'S.
text: TAYLOR, absolutely shattered by his effort, lies out full stretch
text: on his back on the ice, while the others clamber up behind him,
text: equally exhausted, HAROLD collapses beside him.
dialog: 
text: While the OTHERS prepare the next upward LOADS, CLAYBORN is
text: collapsed in a chair, gasping oxygen. JACK looks concerned, but
text: when CLAYBORN catches the look, he puts the BREATHING APPARATUS
text: away and rejoins the work.
dialog: 71
scene_heading: 61_:_ EXT : CAMP TWO : DAY i 61
dialog: 
text: With TAYLOR leading, the FOUR CLIMBERS arrive at the slightly
dialog: less than sheer incline that will be Camp Two. The VIEW is ever
dialog: more extraordinary, although only TAYLOR has eyes for it; the
text: others are too wrecked. TAYLOR breaks out the TWO-WAY RADIO:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Camp Two to Base. Come in
dialog: Base ~-- you read me?
scene_heading: 62 : EXT : BASE CAMP : DAY 1 62

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I think I just fucking died,

speaker_heading: TAKANE

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You guys stay here and rest.
dialog: I’1l lay the ropes to Three
dialog: by myself.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: I’m coming with you. But we
dialog: gotta have a drink first.
text: TAYLOR looks at DALLAS; he looks as wasted as the other two, but
text: he is not about to let TAYLOR get the idea that he is top dog.
text: A WHILE LATER: DALLAS & TAYLOR put down their cups, and rope up
text: together. DALLAS is about to move off in the lead, coils of rope
text: over both shoulders, when TAYLOR light~heartedly pulls him back.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Thought I was climbing
dialog: lead today?
text: DALLAS shrugs “oh yeah -~ forgot", and steps aside to let TAYLOR
text: make the first move across a difficult face of icy granite.
scene_heading: 64: EXT : CAMP TWO i: EVENING ee 4
text: By the time TAYLOR & DALLAS make their way back down to Camp Two,
text: TAKANE & HAROLD have set up camp on the narrow ledge, and the
text: weather is closing in. TAKANE hands the two climbers hot drinks.
speaker_heading: TAKANE
text: Storm coming in. Otherwise
dialog: we’re in great shape.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Heard from the others?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: They'il be here any minute.
text: TAYLOR looks over the edge to where: Five hundred feet below Camp
text: Two, the heavily-laden CLAYBORN, JACK & MALIK are hauling them-
text: selves very slowly up the rope. Then CLOUDS blow across the
text: mountain, obliterating the climbers.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Everything go okay?
text: TAYLOR turns and nods nonchalantly, but DALLAS doesn’t respond;
text: HAROLD cannot tell whether it is from exhaustion or disdain, and
text: wonders what passed between the two men when they were alone on
text: the mountain. The wind is getting stronger every moment.
dialog: 73
dialog: 
text: The LIGHTS from the three tiny tents squeezed onto the inadequate
text: ledge are barely visible through the storm-driven cloud and snow.
text: While the LAMP splutters and the tent heaves in the wind, HAROLD
dialog: & TAYLOR talk before going to sleep:
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: How did you go with Dallas
dialog: today?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Come on - what happened?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Something must have. I mean —~
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We laid rope. I led most of
text: the day. He didn’t say a word.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Not one?!!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (SHAKES HIS HEAD)
dialog: He’s quite strong ---
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: a What do you think about
dialog: when you’re climbing?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Sex.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Sex you’ve had, or sex you’re
dialog: going to have?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Sex I didn’t have. I think
dialog: about the ones that got away.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You mean there were some?!?
dialog: 74
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Cindy. I never had Cindy.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Thanks very much!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: No ~ there was a moment there ~
dialog: when you first met her ~ she -~
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: She what? You mean you jerk
dialog: yourself off on mountains
dialog: thinking about my wife?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Never mind. You asked me.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You’re fucking serious, aren’t
dialog: you? You get me up here --—
text: But this fascinating conversation is interrupted by TAKANE, who
text: unzips and bursts into their tent, a furious flurry of SNOW
text: blowing in with him. As he frantically re-zips the tent:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What’s up?
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: Clayborn’s sick! Think it’s edema.
dialog: 
scene_heading: NI/EXT i CLAYBORN'’S TENT : NIGHT os 67
text: HAROLD, TAYLOR, TAKANE, MALIK & JACK squeeze into the tiny tent,
text: where CLAYBORN lies in his sleeping bag looking dreadful. His
text: lips are blue, his breathing weak and ragged. JACK is taking his
dialog: pulse
speaker_heading: - CLAYBORN
dialog: Don’t feel --~ too good.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You don’t look too good.
dialog: I mean -~ er --
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: Tonight?!?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We gotta get him as low as

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Who’s gonna go with him?
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'll go.
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: I will go also.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The rest of you wait out
dialog: the storm here. Let’s do it!
text: JACK is administering oxygen, but CLAYBORN is almost too listless
text: to breath it in. While all hands urgently strip off their
text: leader’s sleeping bag and help pack the necessary gear ...
text: OUTSIDE THE TENT: DALLAS stands aloof in the storm, waiting for
text: the reins of power to fall into his hands,
scene_heading: 68: EXT : CAMP TWO: NIGHT 0 8
text: The storm is slightly easier when JACK & MALIK clip CLAYBORN onto
text: the fixed DOWN-ROPE - they all wear LAMPS on their helmets — and
text: ease him over the edge. JACK & TAKANE test their RADIOS, then
text: TAYLOR, HAROLD, TAKANE & DALLAS stand and watch the THREE OTHERS
text: disappear before scurrying back to their respective tents ...
dialog: 
text: Back in their sleeping bags, there is the first sign of real
text: tension between the two friends. HAROLD stares heatedly at
text: TAYLOR, who is about to extinguish the LAMP ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: T usually just take what I
dialog: want and fuck the consequences
dialog: H. I didn’t take Cindy, okay?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Who says she’d have wanted you?
text: TAYLOR just smiles and turns off the LIGHT. The WIND rages harder
dialog: again outside ...
dialog: 76
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/O
dialog: Think they'll make it?
speaker_heading: HAROLD V/0O
dialog: You’re a shit Taylor.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/O
dialog: Yeah, but at least I don’t mind
dialog: telling the truth about it.
scene_heading: 703 EXT + CAMP TWO: DAY 70
text: The STORM is much easier now, and the FOUR CLIMBERS stand about
text: ready to set off back up to Camp Three. DALLAS is on the RADIO to
dialog: Base Camp:
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: But he’s okay?
speaker_heading: JACK V/O
dialog: He’s not great, but he’s
dialog: stable. Malik’s gone back
dialog: to the dump for more oxygen.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: What about the weather?
speaker_heading: JACK V/O
dialog: Patchy. Tomorrow should be
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Roger. We’re heading up now.
dialog: We’11 call you from Three.
speaker_heading: JACK V/O
dialog: Take it easy. Over.
text: The FOUR OF THEM zip up the TENTS, don their extra~heavy PACKS
dialog: and set off up the rope
dialog: 
text: The FOUR CLIMBERS haul themselves up the rope between Camps Two
text: and Three; first TAKANE, then DALLAS, HAROLD, and TAYLOR brings
text: up the rear.
text: TAYLOR pauses for a moment and looks up towards the summit
text: A gap in the CLOUDS appears, and the SUMMIT is briefly visible,
text: like an Indian arrow head against the troubled sky.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT i CAMP THREE : DAY _ 172
dialog: 
text: The FOUR CLIMBERS pause at the end of the FIXED ROPES — the site
text: for CAMP THREE. While the weather looks a little clearer, TAKANE
text: brews drinks and DALLAS talks to Base:
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Camp Three to Base. Can
dialog: you read me, over?
speaker_heading: JACK V/O
dialog: Clear as a bell, boy. How
dialog: you all doing?
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: We're all fine. How’s Clayborn?
speaker_heading: JACK V/O
dialog: He’s a iittle better. He's
dialog: sleeping most of the time.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: How's the weather?
speaker_heading: JACK V/O
dialog: Reasonable.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: We're going to keep on going
dialog: up to Four.
text: The OTHER THREE look at each other; DALLAS has taken an executive
dialog: decision without consulting them.
speaker_heading: JACK V/O
dialog: What's the big hurry?
text: DALLAS looks back at the others, but despite a few significant
text: looks, none of them choose to dispute the call.
speaker_heading: ” DALLAS
dialog: We’ll call you from Four. Over.
text: DALLAS switches off the RADIO, stows it in his pack, and accepts
text: a HOT DRINK from TAKANE.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Hell - why not? We can be on
dialog: the summit for breakfast.
text: DALLAS looks shifty, while HAROLD strips off a glove to inspect
text: for frostbite. TAYLOR touches his hot metal mug to one of
text: HAROLD'S bare, white FINGERS ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Can you feel that?
dialog: 78
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No.
text: TAYLOR looks at TAKANE, and minutes later ...
text: HAROLD squats soaking his two bare hands in hot water in the
text: COOKING POT. Meanwhile DALLAS is surveying the next pitch.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: We'll take that ridge there,
dialog: then traverse that wall ~--
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You can traverse it if you
dialog: like. It looks rotten to me.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: How can you tell from here?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Like I said - you can go that
dialog: way you want. I’1l take what-
text: ever’s in back of the ridge.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
text: A team sticks together.
text: TAYLOR looks around for support, but both of the others avoid his
text: gaze. TAYLOR shrugs mock-democratically and looks back up at the
text: big wall facing them...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Hope you remember that when
dialog: the shit hits the fan.
dialog: 
text: JACK stares at the mountain through a powerful TELESCOPE on a
text: tripod, while CLAYBORN dozes beside him in a deckchair, wrapped
text: in his sleeping bag, an OXYGEN CYLINDER on the snow beside him.
text: JACK turns to say something, but realizes that CLAYBORN is out of
text: it, then stands back to allow MALIK to look through the telescope
dialog: 
text: TAYLOR climbs across the extremely dangerous wall of blue ice
text: over granite. He looks down at the OTHER THREE CLIMBERS waiting
text: on the ledge below, then drives in another ICE SCREW, clips onto
text: it, and allows it to take his weight. It doesn’t! A huge chunk of
text: rotten ice gives way all round where the screw went in, and
text: TAYLOR drops into space.
speaker_heading: 719
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: FALLING!!!
text: The OTHERS take precautionary tension on the rope as TAYLOR’S
text: momentum rips out three other screws before the fourth - and last
text: ~ holds! TAYLOR ends up dangling limply in space not far above
text: the others’ heads. He looks down at them — and smiles ironically.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Hey fellas! Guess what? There's
dialog: some rotten ice up here!
text: TAYLOR'S axe & hammer hang from their wrist straps. He spins on
text: the rope, slams the point of his axe into the ice, and pulls
text: himself back onto the wall.
dialog: 2:75
dialog: 
text: CLAYBORN is awake now, and looking slightly better. But he is
text: still weak, and can barely stand. JACK is still looking through
dialog: the telescope ...
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There! Just below the Mushroom,
dialog: They’re making real good time,
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN

dialog: What do you think?

speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: I say we go for it.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN V/O
dialog: You've put in three of four

speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: No problem.

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Now? Oh man ~- I’m fucked,

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Ohhh -- okay ~- okay. I’m ready.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR

dialog: them.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Take it easy. No hurry.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I thought you said ~~
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: I said "we" are going for the
dialog: summit. No one said "we" meant
dialog: all of us.
dialog: 81
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: So what DOES “we" mean?
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: It means me -- and Takane,
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Now wait a minute! If it’s

dialog: got to take the best two.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You -- and me.
speaker_heading: TAKANE & HAROLD
dialog: Now you wait a minute!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR

dialog: their "us two as a team" trust.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Fuck you Taylor! What is this?
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: Takane and I are the summit team.
dialog: Been that way since before you.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: But you’ve got to take me!
dialog: I’m the best climber. And I'm
dialog: the fittest of any of us.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: I'm not taking you. That's that.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Why the hell can’t we all go?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Give me that radio!

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Clayborn? Taylor! We got a

speaker_heading: TAYLOR switches off

speaker_heading: CLAYBORN V/O
dialog: Well whatever it is, Dallas
dialog: will have to sort it out.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: No - listen! We had a deal.
dialog: We all get an equal shot at

speaker_heading: CLAYBORN V/O
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR

speaker_heading: CLAYBORN V/O
dialog: Impossible, Two have got to

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: But ---
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN V/0O°
dialog: Two stay! That’s an order!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Okay -- okay ~- so now the
dialog: question is which two, right?
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN V/O
dialog: Dallas will have to decide.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: WHAT? !?
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN V/O
dialog: I can’t decide who goes from

speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/O
dialog: Huh? What?
speaker_heading: HAROLD V/0
dialog: Dunno - I thought I heard
dialog: something ~~ a voice --—
dialog: 85
text: And just then ... both TAYLOR & HAROLD SHOUT OUT in alarm asa
text: BODY crashes into the tent!
text: When they sort themselves out, they discover that the surprise
text: visitor is TAKANE - delirious and frozen almost to death. They
text: light the LAMP, re-pitch the tent and lay TAKANE out inside it.
text: Then, while TAYLOR gets the stove going for hot drinks, HAROLD
text: does what he can for his fingers, biack with frostbite. Finally,
text: TAKANE has his eyes open and manages to take some liquid.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (SHAKING HIM)
dialog: Did you make the summit?
text: TAKANE shakes his head. From the look in his eyes, we can tell
text: his spirit has been broken. The mountain has told him to die.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What happened to Dallas?
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: Wouldn’t come down ~-—
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You mean == he was still
dialog: alive when you left him?!!
speaker_heading: TAKANE
speaker_heading: (NODS HEAD)
dialog: Storm hit ~-- he wanted to
dialog: wait it out -- he ---
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: But you didn’t have a tent!
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: He wanted the mountain so bad.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: ~ And you?
speaker_heading: TAKANE
dialog: It was very bad up there --—
text: dark. I can't feel my legs.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Has he still got the radio?
text: TAKANE shrugs, and TAYLOR grabs their RADIO up again
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Dallas! Come in you dumb shit!
speaker_heading: (SQUELCH --~—)
dialog: Answer me goddammit! Dallas!
dialog: Where the hell are you man?
dialog: 86
text: TAYLOR puts down the radio and looks at TAKANE, who has dropped
text: off to sleep in HAROLD’S arms. Outside, the STORM rages harder
text: than ever. TAYLOR looks at HAROLD, who shakes his head.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT/EXT_: HAROLD'S & TAYLOR'S TENT ~ CAMP FOUR: DAWN _
dialog: 
text: HAROLD wakes first, and listens: the storm has died away. He
text: looks across to TAYLOR, who is still asleep. Between them lies
text: TAKANE, covered with every piece of spare clothing they could
text: find. HAROLD sits up an checks TAKANE’s pulse, then his eyelids.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Taylor!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: WAKE UP!
scene_heading: (TAYLOR OPENS HIS EYES)
dialog: Tak's dead!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: But he was --- oh fuck!
text: Suddenly TAYLOR is out of his sleeping bag and, after a cursory,
text: almost superstitious glance at the corpse, he is unzipping the
text: tent. OUTSIDE: there is a miraculous clear, still, blue dawn.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Jesus Taylor! What do we DO?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I don’t know!
text: TAYLOR picks up the RADIO, toys with it, then looks at HAROLD; he
dialog: really doesn’t know.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: ~ We gotta go look for Dallas,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah! Dallas --~ right! You
dialog: up for that?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I’m up for it. Are you up
dialog: for it?
text: TAYLOR, who seems uncharacteristically confused by this tragedy,
text: nods vaguely and tosses the RADIO to HAROLD ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Here - you talk to them.
dialog: 87
dialog: 
scene_heading: -&§_TAYLOR’S TENT - CAMP FOUR : DAWN i: 84
text: TAYLOR & HAROLD stand, heads bowed, for a moment’s silence by the
text: snow grave they have dug for TAKANE.
scene_heading: 85_: EXT : THE UPPER MOUNTAIN : DAY 185
dialog: 
text: In clear weather, TAYLOR & HAROLD search the accessible part of
text: the upper mountain. But without any real clues as to where Dallas
dialog: might be, their chances of finding him - dead or alive - are
text: slim. Taylor is back in his single minded warrior mode.
dialog: They climb free-style - no safety rope ~ up a reasonable ice
text: chimney until they reach a small plateau above it, from where
text: they can see fairly far around them. No sign of Dallas anywhere.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
scene_heading: DALLAS! ! (BEAT) DALL-AAAS!!
dialog: He could be anywhere up here.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
speaker_heading: (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Hey Dalias!! You reading us?
dialog: Where the hell are you?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Oh man this is pointless.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You think he’s dead?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah - I think he’s dead.
dialog: Gotta be. Don’t you think?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Jack? Phillip? Anyone awake
dialog: down there?
speaker_heading: JACK V/O
dialog: Reading you Harold. Over.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: There’s no sign of him up
dialog: here. You heard anything?
speaker_heading: JACK V/O
dialog: No. Listen - Phillip’s getting
dialog: worse again. We've got to get
dialog: him down quick.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: How the hell you gonna do that?
dialog: 88
speaker_heading: JACK V/0
dialog: Malik’s trying to get an army
dialog: chopper to come up for us.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Where does that leave us?
speaker_heading: JACK Vso
dialog: A long way from home ~ unless you
dialog: get your asses down here real quick.
dialog: The weather’s gonna hold today, but
dialog: after that I don’t like it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
speaker_heading: (TO TAYLOR)
dialog: What do you think?
text: HAROLD looks above them ~ to where the SUMMIT glints crystalline
text: white in the early morning sun.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR kills the
dialog: stare at the summit
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We didn’t come up here for
dialog: nothing! Screw the chopper.
dialog: We walked in, we can walk out.
speaker_heading: (GRABBING THE RADIO)
dialog: Jack? -- Wish us luck. We're
dialog: going for it.
speaker_heading: JACK V/0
dialog: But -~=
text: radio and slips it into the pack. They both
dialog: again ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We leave everything here ~ tent,
dialog: bags ~- travel light -- we can
dialog: be back here by tonight.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Right! Then ~ bit of luck - we're
dialog: back at Base by tomorrow night —~-
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: And I bet you the goddam chopper
dialog: hasn't even arrived by then!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: We're going to do it Taylor!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah! Except I thought you said
dialog: you didn’t trust me any more.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: B89
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I’m working on it.
text: TAYLOR smiles —- they do their “Victory” handshake ~- then start
text: stripping TENTS ETC out of their packs ...
text: CAMP FIVE established HAROLD & TAYLOR, carrying only the bare
dialog: minimum equipment necessary for a day's climbing, set off up
dialog: 
speaker_heading: oe BS
text: While MALIK SHOUTS into the RADIO in Pakistani in the background,
text: JACK looks through the TELESCOPE, and CLAYBORN takes up his usual
text: position in the chair. He is looking alert, but very ill.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Yeah - I can see them.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: How close are they?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Close enough. They've got
text: a shot at it.
text: CLAYBORN suddenly starts COUGHING desperately - he sees a speck
text: of BLOOD on his white glove - while MALIK SHOUTS even louder.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: I’m sorry. The chopper comes,
dialog: we’re not waiting. It’s their
dialog: risk. That’s it.
text: HAROLD’S FACE shows his sheer exhaustion as he drags himself up a
text: steep but negotiable ICE SLOPE. At this airless altitude, every
dialog: slightest movement is a tremendous act of will, and the whole
text: exercise at this point is reduced to brute animal effort. Just
text: ahead of him, TAYLOR rests, waiting for his buddy to catch up. He
text: looks at his WATCH, then he looks up at the SUMMIT, which doesn't
text: look so very far away now. HAROLD collapses beside him.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Come on! Another coupla hours.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oooo have mercy brother!
dialog: 90
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We left the mercy behind with
dialog: the gas-powered pitons H. Ain’t
dialog: no mercy in the Death Zone.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I HAVE GOT TO REST!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: We rest on the summit.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Right! Rest on the summit!
text: HAROLD rams his face into the snow, gathering the strength to
text: carry on. But first he lets out a desperate, defiant HOWL ...
text: We watch the TWO COLORED FIGURES dragging themselves over yet
text: another dangerous ICE CORNICE at somewhere around 28,000 feet,
text: and somehow sense the almost surreal quality of this ridiculous
dialog: endeavour; we get the idea of two guys locked into some insane,
text: self-imposed ritual where a single false move will kill them;
dialog: where the best they can hope for is just to survive,
text: A mere few hundred feet above them, the pristine white SUMMIT
text: dazzles in the clear, strong sunlight ... the final slog up to
dialog: the summit is not technically difficult, but it definitely
text: presents a challenge to the will. Both men are now at the end of
text: their reserves of strength, and trudge slow motion up the steep
text: slope as though they wear lead shoes in some dream,
text: HAROLD pauses and looks at the incredible VIEW; he imagines he
text: can see the whole Himalaya laid out around him. Then he looks up
text: at the SUMMIT just above them ~ and he knows for the first time
text: with certainty that they are going to make it. Just ahead of him,
text: TAYLOR falls to his knees for a moment's respite. HAROLD slowly
text: catches up to him...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: _ Taylor! We’re gonna do it!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah! I know.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Come on! Ten feet more!
text: TAYLOR looks at the supreme sense of accomplishment on HAROLD’S
text: face, and knows that this is Harold’s Big Moment on the mountain.
text: Harold has transcended himself.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You go on. I just ~--
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No! We rest on the summit!
dialog: 
scene_heading: 88_: EXT : THE SUMMIT : DAY 88
text: TAYLOR allows HAROLD to haul him to his knees, and they stagger
text: the last few feet to the SUMMIT, glove in glove, together. They
text: embrace in exhausted ecstacy and collapse to the ground.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh man we did it! We fucking
dialog: did it!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You did it H. You did it -
dialog: and no one can ever take it
dialog: away from you.
text: They stand and turn slowly around, looking at the VIEW. It is
dialog: later in the day than perhaps they had hoped for; the sun is
text: already setting behind ANGRY CLOUDS on the Western horizon, and
dialog: the windchill factor is high.
text: HAROLD takes out his CAMERA and takes some pictures; then he gets
text: TAYLOR to take several of him mugging at the exact highest point
text: of the mountain. Then they prop up the camera on a pack frame,
text: set the timer release, and take a picture of themselves together.
text: While HAROLD, still breathing heavily, continues to be lost in
text: wonder, TAYLOR gets out the TWO-WAY RADIO:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Hey! Summit party to Base!
dialog: You still with us? Jack?
text: The RADIO WHINES and splutters. Finally:
speaker_heading: JACK V/0
dialog: Taylor! Harold! Where are you?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: On top of the fucking world.
dialog: That was the idea wasn’t it?
dialog: Except -~ we forgot the flag!
speaker_heading: JACK V/0
dialog: Congratulations! Hang on ~--
dialog: 
text: JACK passes the RADIO to CLAYBORN, still swathed in quilting and
text: seated in his deckchair. He COUGHS as he takes the radio.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Taylor? Phillip here.
dialog: Congratulations!
dialog: 92
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/O
dialog: Yeah. It’s a top spot - view
dialog: is kinda like the one from
dialog: your office. How you feeling?
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: I feel like shit. I got to
dialog: get off this mountain.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/O
dialog: I know what you mean. We
dialog: heard about the chopper.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: We're hoping tomorrow/day
dialog: after. Can you be down by
dialog: tomorrow night?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/O
dialog: We’ll wait here -- send the
dialog: chopper up for us!
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Taylor -~ I have to tell you:
dialog: I’m dying. If you're not here,
dialog: it will leave without you.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR V/O
dialog: Whatever. Here ~ speak to Harold.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Harold?
speaker_heading: HAROLD V/O
dialog: Phillip! Wish you were here!
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: If I was ten years younger
dialog: I would be.
speaker_heading: ~ HAROLD V/0
dialog: No --~ it can happen to anyone.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Especially grandfathers. Weil
dialog: done Harold. Get your ass down
dialog: here. Move it!
text: He hands the RADIO back to JACK.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And watch the weather you guys.
dialog: You’re going to have a rough
dialog: night up there. We’ll keep the
dialog: line open, you need us.
dialog: 93
dialog: 
text: The moody SUNSET is rapidly becoming obscured by black clouds as
text: TAYLOR & HAROLD toast themselves with a hot brew. They seem very
text: nonchalant, and not in any hurry ~- they are possibly suffering a
dialog: little from high altitude “everything is fabulous" euphoria.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Thinking about the next girl?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I’m thinking about the next
dialog: mountain.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Let's get off this one first.
dialog: What’s the strategy?
text: As they pack up the STOVE etc and make ready for their descent:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: The climb down is always the
dialog: hardest part, you know?
text: After one last look at the summit, they turn and head on down the
text: mountain. Somehow they both know that this will be the hard part.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE MOUNTAIN : NIGHT. OL
dialog: 
text: TAYLOR & HAROLD are slipping down an ICE SLOPE in the dark when
text: BLACK CLOUDS swallow the FULL MOON - and seconds later, the SNOW
text: STORM hits! In seconds, visibility is drastically reduced, and so
text: TAYLOR gestures to HAROLD that they should rope up. In their
dialog: determination to travel light, they have only brought one short
text: length of rope between them.
text: When ready, they SHOUT something to each other - the wind blows
text: it away - and then they continue down. The storm only gets worse.
text: They fight their way along a narrow ridge, but the weather is
dialog: beating them, and it is time to find shelter. Down there?
text: A hundred feet further down, after a life-saving belay by HAROLD,
text: TAYLOR finds a protected bank of snow big enough to allow an ice
text: cave. They move to the face away from the worst of the wind, and
text: dig into the soft snow frantically with their hands ...
scene_heading: 92: INT : ICE CAVE DURING STORM : NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sheltered by TAYLOR, the STOVE CATCHES ALIGHT. HAROLD slams snow
text: into their pot, and sets it over the fire to meit; the flames
text: reveal the fear in their faces. HAROLD’S HANDS are shaking ...
dialog: 94
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: “Climb her while she sleeps!"
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Uh huh - and this one’s woken
dialog: up for a midnight snack. Food!
text: TAYLOR rummages in the pack, but all he comes up with are four
text: Trail Mix bars and one pack of dried chicken soup.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Great! I love to travel light!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: This is a picnic! I lost
dialog: twenty pounds one trip!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You know -~ I’m a bit worried!
text: TAYLOR flicks a look at him as he stirs the snow-soup.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah -- maybe it is shaping
text: up into a bit of an epic.
text: HAROLD grabs the RADIO, SHOUTS into it ... but they get nothing
dialog: but STATIC ...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: An epic? It’s already a Near
dialog: Death Experience!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: This the worst jam you ever
dialog: been in?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: 7 TAYLOR
dialog: Nothing’s happened yet!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Two guys are dead and ---~ and
dialog: we’re circling at ten thousand
text: feet over Base Camp in a white-—
dialog: out with one packet of chicken
dialog: soup and no landing gear! Want
dialog: me to go on?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Everything’s cool. We’ll make it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You’re just as scared as I am.
dialog: 95
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Tf I was IT wouldn’t tell you.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You don’t have to tell me.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Fear is bullshit H. Choke you to
dialog: death. Ignore it. We’re going to
dialog: get out of this. This storm’11
dialog: be over in a day or two --—
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: We’ve got nothing to eat!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Don’t need it.
text: The STOVE SPLUTTERS - and dies.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Or drink. There’s no more fuel!
text: TAYLOR simply huddles himself up nearest the hole and stares out
dialog: into the storm ...
text: TAYLOR looks at his WATCH: 9:37 AM. Twelve hours have passed and
text: the TWO MEN have barely moved. The STORM continues unabated ..,
text: HAROLD looks at his WATCH: 4:46 PM. The wind has died right down,
dialog: and although visibility is still poor, weather conditions are
dialog: altogether better.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Let’s go!
text: TAYLOR gestures "okay", and reaches for the RADIO to call Base.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Hey! Base! Jack! ~-— Fuck!!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What’s up?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Fucking BATTERIES!!
text: TAYLOR hurls the now useless RADIO through the mouth of the cave,
text: and then, without a further word, TAYLOR zips up the PACK, and
dialog: they’re out of there ...
dialog: 96
dialog: 24
dialog: 
scene_heading: NG_DOWN THE MOUNTAIN 3 EVENING 0
dialog: 
text: The weather is only reasonable, and it is already almost dark
text: when they come to the top of an ICE CLIFF. HAROLD is the more
text: anxious and exhausted of the two, and as soon as they stop
text: moving, his teeth start CHATTERING.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What do you think? You
dialog: want to bivouac here?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. Let’s do it,
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Rope up?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What’s the point? Never
dialog: get a belay in this ice.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You feeling all right?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Come on Taylor! Let’s just
dialog: do it, all right?
text: TAYLOR shrugs, and moves to take the lead down the dangerous ice.
text: Crampons and axes digging desperately into the flaky ice, HAROLD
text: Follows down just after TAYLOR, who is climbing faster and more
text: confidently. HAROLD closes his eyes, breathes hard, and puts one
text: foot in front of the other. Each step, each movement is agony.
text: Half-way down, HAROLD looks below, to where TAYLOR is even
text: further ahead of him than before. Fifty feet below TAYLOR, there
text: is a narrow snow-covered ledge, and below that, another yawning
text: drop. The height makes HAROLD momentarily dizzy.
text: TAYLOR looks up:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Okay H?!?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
speaker_heading: OKAY!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Bad ice here. Keep right!
text: HAROLD yanks out his axe, and stretches to his right, looking for
text: purchase in order to change the angle of his descent. His first
text: attempt is too weak to penetrate the ice; the second seems to
text: hold. He tests his weight on the axe, pulls out his right crampon
dialog: and stretches it across ...
dialog: 97
text: Pinned to the wall by his left boot and his right hand, HAROLD
text: has got himself stranded; his free right boot cannot find
text: purchase, and he starts to flail with it
text: TAYLOR looks up, alerted by the shower of ICE CHIPS from above.
text: And just then HAROLD starts to panic ...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: TAYLOR!!!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Hang on! Coming up!
text: TAYLOR begins to get organized to go back up, when the point of
text: HAROLD'S AXE starts to pull out of the ice and ---—
text: HAROLD FALLS! Grazing down the sheer wall of ice, he passes the
text: appalled TAYLOR in a blur, and plummets to the SNOW LEDGE below.
text: Miraculously, HAROLD sticks on the ledge without going over it,
text: but then he lies ominously still, one leg at a crazy angle.
text: TAYLOR crampons down the ice wall as fast as he possibly can ....
text: TAYLOR turns his friend’s head around --- and finds a new and
text: overwhelming fear in HAROLD’S EYES. He also immediately senses
text: the extent of Harold's injuries and fails, in the first moment
text: that their eyes meet, to disguise his certainty that Harold is
text: now doomed to die on the mountain.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What is it? You okay?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Leg!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
scene_heading: (TOUCHING H’S RIGHT LEG)
dialog: This one?
speaker_heading: (HAROLD SCREAMS)
dialog: Can you bend it?
text: TAYLOR shifts HAROLD’S LEG very slightly; HAROLD SCREAMS again.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Broken huh?
text: HAROLD nods his head through the shattering waves of pain. Very
text: gently, TAYLOR opens the sidezip on H’s mountain suit, and care~
text: fully examines the leg; even through the thermal underwear, we
text: can tell that the leg is a complete shambles. HAROLD SCREAMS some
text: more during this operation, tears streaming down his face; then
dialog: he goes all calm...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Don’t think the bone has
dialog: come through the skin.
dialog: 98
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh Cindy -- Cindy -~
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: H! It’s me! I’m here!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I don't want to die.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Who said anything about that?
dialog: This is going to mend fine -~
dialog: bone heals a whole lot better
dialog: if the skin isn’t broken, see?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You can make it. You can still
dialog: make it, but you gotta go now!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I’m going to die, Taylor.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You're not going to die!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I can’t walk. You can’t carry
dialog: me. We haven’t got enough rope
dialog: to work anything with.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I’711 go down and get some.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Taylor -- nobody’s ever got a
dialog: stretcher case off this mountain
dialog: from so high up. Never! Not even
dialog: - with a whole team.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: That’s what I’11 do - I’1l go
dialog: down and get the other guys.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Jack & Malik?!? They’d never
dialog: make it. They did - I’d be dead
dialog: by the time they got here anyway.
text: HAROLD fumbles inside his jacket - and pulls out his WEDDING
text: RING. He snaps the cord, and hands the ring to TAYLOR.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 99
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Give this to Cindy. Tell her
dialog: -- God I dunno -- tell her I
dialog: loved her. And I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Tell her yourself!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Taylor I am dead meat. I cannot
dialog: move! Now get out of here!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I’m not going to do that!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You just going to sit here
dialog: and die with me? Bulishit!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You know what you're asking me
dialog: to do? Is that your twisted
dialog: fuckun’ idea of revenge?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No no no no ---
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yes yes yes yes! Every lousy minute
dialog: of every stinking day! I gotta be
dialog: the selfish rat fuck who left his
dialog: noble buddy to die. Well forget it!
dialog: Not guilty!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You never had a problem with
dialog: being selfish before Taylor -
dialog: it’s practically your religion!
dialog: Why the hell do you have to make
dialog: such a big deal out of it now?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: WHY? Why do you think I do mountains?
dialog: Huh? You got the wife and the kid and
dialog: the nice job in medical research -~~
dialog: that’s great ~~ but what have I got?
dialog: My whole life is about ME, my work is
dialog: all about saving assholes from jail -
dialog: so I come to places like this ~ with
dialog: you ~ to try and find a little grace,
dialog: you know? I don’t want to be seifish
dialog: all my life. Baddahhh! Meet the flip
dialog: side of Taylor Tarantino! I want some
dialog: nobility god damn it - and you - my
dialog: very very best friend - want to take
dialog: that possibility away from me for ever!
dialog: 100
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You want nobility? You want grace?
dialog: Go back!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I_AM NOT GOING BACK TO SPEND FIFTY
dialog: YEARS WITH THE FACT THAT I LEFT MY
text: BUDDY TO DIE ON SOME GODDAM MOUNTAIN!
text: Now HAROLD fumbles in the PACK, and produces his CAMERA.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You’re really my friend Taylor,
dialog: that’s exactly what you’ve got
dialog: to do! I want you to look after
dialog: my son! I want you to give him
dialog: these ~ tell him I made it - tell
dialog: him what a big fucking hero I was.
dialog: Tell him how {f died, and tell him
dialog: how much I loved him -~- that’s
dialog: what I want, and then I'll have it
dialog: all. We can both have it all Taylor,
dialog: if you just -- go back. Please ~-~
text: Their eyes meet for a moment of truth, and then TAYLOR’S EYES are
text: straying down the mountain. After a long and silent conversation:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You're a prince, H.
text: HAROLD turns his head away, smiling to himself mysteriously.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: WHAT??
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Fuck Prince! You're the born
dialog: survivor Taylor. That’s what
dialog: I always admired about you.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Because I’m a ruthless shit
dialog: you admired me?!!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: There’s some destiny thing about
dialog: single-minded people that us
dialog: born losers find very compelling.
dialog: 101
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You are not a loser!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I got everything I wanted — but
dialog: I had to give up everything to
dialog: get it. Is that winning?
text: Meanwhile TAYLOR is stripping every superfluous thing he doesn’t
text: need off his body to reduce the weight; he leaves the PACK with
text: HAROLD, and even takes off his WATCH - we see it says: 6:47 PM,
text: He offers it to HAROLD, who refuses it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: How long have I got?

dialog: How long have I got?
text: HAROLD takes off his own WATCH and throws it into the storm. It
text: lands not far along the ledge. TAYLOR does the same with his
text: WATCH, and then they embrace ....
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I love you H.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I know. And teach Eric to
dialog: climb good, will ya?
text: TAYLOR drives one of his last PITONS into some healthy ice
speaker_heading: TAYLOR

dialog: Oh Jesus! Will you stop it!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yeah ~- guess I better. I'll

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You’11l have to write me a
dialog: letter, ‘’cos I’1ll be in hell.
text: They stares into each others’ eyes for a long, last farewell
text: moment, Their eyes mirror each other's pain, but also each
text: other’s souls; they have at last shared some deep, primal under—
text: standing. And then TAYLOR drops over the ledge and is gone,
dialog: 102
text: HAROLD lies back down and watches TAYLOR'S ROPE tense and twang
text: as he abseils down the face below. Moments later, once TAYLOR has
text: reached bottom, he releases and pulls the rope down after him.
text: CU: the end of the rope as it zips through the piton and silently
text: disappears over the ledge.
text: HAROLD is now totally, utterly alone.
dialog: 
text: JACK enters CLAYBORN'S TENT; the sick man stirs in his sleeping
text: bag; we see his FROSTY BREATH as thin spindrifts of steam.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Phillip! You awake?
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Uh? What is it?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Chopper'11 be here tomorrow.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Haven't heard anything for over
dialog: twenty-four hours.
speaker_heading: CLAYBORN
dialog: Nothing?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Doesn’t look good I’m afraid.
text: CLAYBORN absorbs this new blow, and simply turns his head away.
scene_heading: 26_i_EXT_i TAYLOR'S DESCENT : NIGHT 8 ts 8G
text: Although a cruel wind whips TAYLOR’S FACE, the sky is at least
text: partly clear, and a FULL MOON mocks his efforts to find the best
text: line of descent. Starving and totally exhausted, he trips, falis,
text: and SWEARS violently as he tumbles down a SNOW SLOPE ...
text: TAYLOR comes to rest and lies still for a moment, staring up at
text: the MOON. Then his eyes close; it would be so much easier to
dialog: forget the whole thing and just ..,. go to sleep. SNOW blows
text: across his face, flakes already settling in the hollows ...
dialog: 103
scene_heading: O72 EXT} HAROLD’S LEDGE : NIGHT ts
text: HAROLD lies back staring at the MOON, SINGING to himself to take
text: his mind off his pain, and the hovering prospect of his grim
text: death. He stares too at the WATCH, just out of reach along the
text: ledge, which ticks off the remaining minutes of his existence,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 9B
text: TAYLOR’S EYES pop open; he SHOUTS something to himself, hauls
text: himself to his feet, and starts slamming one boot in front of the
text: other, front-pointing down yet another moonlight-drenched ice
text: face with alarming bravado. TALKING as if to a woman:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Come on baby! You let me climb
dialog: up you ~~ let me climb off ya.
dialog: That’s it -- that’s my girl -~
dialog: I wanted you so bad baby ~~ too
dialog: bad, you know -- and you're the
dialog: best I ever had -~ so let’s not
dialog: spoil it now, huh? Qooo00 I can

dialog: bitch ~~ I can’t see you, but
dialog: I can sure as hell smell you.
scene_heading: 29_i EXT: ON THE MOUNTAIN : NIGHT _ ~ ID
text: SNOW blows off a luminous WATCHFACE, which is ona MAN’S WRIST.
text: The time is 1:12 AM.
dialog: 
text: HAROLD’S frosted eyes are closed as he lies still. He is still
text: SINGING, but--only just, as his teeth are chattering too hard,
text: Nearby, the WATCH continues to count the seconds ...
dialog: 
dialog: 101
text: A beard of CLOUD blows across the FULL MOON as TAYLOR slithers
text: down an iced granite face. His face is bleeding, his knees
text: bruised. He lands on an apparent ridge of snow, turns and moves
text: towards the edge to inspect the drop ...
text: The crust gives way without warning as TAYLOR approaches the edge
text: and he slides over it, slowly at first, as though in a controlled
text: glide. But then he does gather speed, and he has no control
text: whatsoever. At one moment he is falling freely through space ...
dialog: 104
text: And then his fall is abruptly broken! He lies very still on soft
text: snow, his eyes closed. A SNOWFLAKE staunches the fresh BLOOD on
dialog: his face ...
text: TAYLOR’S HAND grips the ROPE that broke his fall. His fingers
text: move, his eyes open. He pulls the rope, which zips out of the new
text: snow towards the other end of the ledge. TAYLOR staggers up and
text: hauls himself along the rope, at the other end of which is nee
text: A partly snow-covered DALLAS WOOLF, deceased. His LEFT HAND is
text: frozen in the grip of death around the other end of the ROPE. And
text: on his wrist, the luminous-face WATCHFACE (SCENE 99) says: 1:23AM
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Been looking for you, Snowman.
text: DALLAS’ EXPRESSION is a frozen moment of illuminated outrage that
dialog: he too should be subject to the laws of nature. TAYLOR’S FINGER
text: prods the brittle arc of his proud blue patrician nose. TAYLOR
text: switches on DALLAS’ HEAD LAMP =~ it blinds him! He LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: No offence - I would piss on
dialog: your grave — but I’d for sure
dialog: freeze my dick off doing it,
dialog: know what I mean?
text: DALLAS is frozen upright against the wall so that TAYLOR has to
text: RIP him off the ice like a strip of velcro in order to get at the
text: COILS OF ROPE on the dead man’s shoulders ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yes Virginia, there is a
dialog: Santa Claus ~~~
text: Now TAYLOR can also reach DALLAS’ PACK HARNESS. He manages with
text: difficulty to remove the PACK from the frozen corpse, now lying
text: on the ground, then starts inspecting the CONTENTS ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: And this year he’s brought
dialog: you -~- an oxygen cylinder!
dialog: Just what I needed!
speaker_heading: (HE TAKES A HIT)
dialog: Meat Bars! You shouldn’t have!
speaker_heading: (HE TAKES A BITE)
dialog: A Rocket Flare! For the boy
dialog: who has everything!
text: TAYLOR STUFFS the FLARE and a number of other useful items back
text: into the PACK. Still rummaging:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Where's the goddam radio? Jesus!
dialog: The one thing I actually ASKED
dialog: for! Always thought Santa sucked!
dialog: 105
text: Finished packing, TAYLOR stares down again at DALLAS’ frozen face
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: I don’t exactly know why I
dialog: hated you so much, but I sure
dialog: as hell did, Snowman. Probably
dialog: cos you didn’t trust me.
text: Finally, TAYLOR removes DALLAS’ ICE AXE which is still attached
text: to DALLAS’ RIGHT HAND. He studies it for a moment ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: You think I’m a low-life, huh?
dialog: I leave Harold to die, so’s I can
dialog: go back to knock off his widow!
dialog: Except you don’t even believe I
dialog: can get off this mountain, do you?
text: TAYLOR, wearing DALLAS’ HEAD-LAMPED HELMET, has by now donned the
text: PACK, and makes ready to go. He looks again at the second ICE AXE
text: in his hand, decides he doesn't need it, and buries the handle in
text: the snow near DALLAS’ HEAD to form a crude erucifix.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: News flash Woolf: I'm going to
dialog: have it all. See you in hell!
text: TAYLOR turns away, and looks out over the edge of the ledge-~--
text: down the slippery white moon-lit slopes to safety below.
text: CU: HAROLD'S WATCH ticking off the seconds
text: By now HAROLD is almost delirious —- and almost frozen to his
text: ledge; the only movement we see is in his vapidly flickering EYES
text: Then he HEARS it — a VOICE - a distant, urgent voice ~ and it’s
text: talking to him - he’s suddenly sure of it!
text: HAROLD'S POV: standing before him on the ledge, a large blurred
text: SHAPE ~ almost like the shape of a man — and it has something
text: like an AXE in its hand, raised aloft, as if to strike him.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: No? This is Santa Claus baby.
dialog: Tell you what -- I'll give you
dialog: Miss Mammogram for Xmas -- if

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
scene_heading: (RIPPING HIS GOGGLES OFF)
dialog: Sorry to disappoint you
dialog: Virginia,
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What's happening?
text: TAYLOR kneels to supply HAROLD with LIQUID and comfort
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: New plan! Altered situation
dialog: assessment!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Actually --~ I am kinda glad
dialog: you showed up.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Yeah? Why’s that?
speaker_heading: HARGLD
dialog: I had just absolutely definitely
dialog: decided that I do not want to die
dialog: up here.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: That's what I wanted to hear!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yeah -- see I thought -~ there’s
dialog: two billion guys on the planet -
dialog: and any one of them’d take better
dialog: care of Cindy than you would.
text: Meanwhile TAYLOR is applying OXYGEN, more LIQUID and MEAT BARS to
text: HAROLD’S FACE, as well as uncoiling ROPES, repacking the other
text: PACK, and Stripping down the frame of the new one to make a
text: basket-brace for HAROLD'S LEG, which TAYLOR now prods:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Feel anything?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Not really. What’s that mean?
text: Now TAYLOR theatrically produces a big KNIFE; JOKINGLY:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Means gangrene and I’ve gotta
dialog: cut it off. Now. Save us both
dialog: a lot of trouble later, dig?
dialog: 107
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I think Cindy is kind of into
dialog: the idea of her husband coming
dialog: home with two legs, you know?
text: They do their "Victory" handshake, and then TAYLOR clips a ROPE
text: through HAROLD’S HARNESS. While he straps the dead leg into its
text: BRACE, and HAROLD winces in newly revived pain, TAYLOR produces a
text: beautifully thin FLASK.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Drink! 'Cos this is gonna
dialog: hurt like hell.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Xmas Present from Dallas.
dialog: Morphine base.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: This isn't -- ouch! -- like
dialog: you Taylor. Pain mitigation?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Must be going all new-fangled
dialog: in my old age. You should see
dialog: some of the other tricks I got
dialog: in here. Now ~~ listen up: we

speaker_heading: JACK

scene_heading: 104_: EXT : TAYLOR LOWERING HAROLD : DAWN 104
dialog: 
text: The roped HAROLD ~ an ICE AXE strapped to each wrist — bounces
text: down an iced rock face at a controlled but harrowing pace. Every
text: time his damaged leg makes contact with rock - ie often — pain
text: cracks through his synapses like high country lightning.
text: The pace slows, then stops. HAROLD grimly hobbles himself onto a
text: firm footing, and tugs the rope to signal that he is in position.
text: CU: the exhausted but hopeful HAROLD.
text: AT THE TOP OF THE ROPE: TAYLOR breaks the belay and rapidly solos
text: down after it. The WIND is stronger again ...
text: TAYLOR arrives above the waiting HAROLD, then manoeuvres himself
text: down beside him. RED SKY in the Morning, HAROLD’S warning.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
scene_heading: (FURIOUSLY RECOILING ROPE)

dialog: Weather!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Ready to go again?

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
scene_heading: ~ (CLIPPING ONTO THE PITON)
dialog: Last one. What the hell!
scene_heading: (HE TAKES THE STRAIN)
dialog: Go!
text: HAROLD falls into space, and we watch nylon ROPE burn hot through
text: TAYLOR'S clenched GLOVES ...
text: Before all the rope has run out HAROLD is lowered over a HANGING
text: PRECIPICE. Dangling on the rope, he cannot touch the ice slope,
dialog: which is just out of reach, to get any purchase.
text: BELOW HIM: the slope runs steeply away for some distance, after
text: which it abruptly disappears into a GIANT CREVASSE.
dialog: 109
speaker_heading: HAROLD
scene_heading: (SCREAMING INTO THE WIND)
dialog: TAYLOR! PULL ME BACK!
text: AT THE TOP OF THE ROPE: TAYLOR hangs desperately onto the belay,
text: SHOUTING hopelessly:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: What the hell's happening H?
dialog: Can you hear me? You stuck?
text: BELOW: HAROLD continues to twist in the wind, SHOUTING vainly--~
text: TAYLOR is finding it hard to maintain his foothold and keep a
text: grip of the rope at the same time ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: HAROLD! ! Jesus -- I can’t
dialog: hold ~~~ I’m losing it!!
text: HAROLD hangs desperately on, flailing with his good leg to try to
text: swing himself across to the slope. Even at the greatest extent of
text: his arc, he is missing by at least a foot,
text: TAYLOR meanwhile is about to fall; he simply cannot maintain his
text: position and take the pressure on the rope any longer. He is
text: working on the rope with the KNIFE ...
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: H man -- you’re there -~
dialog: believe me -- there’s no
dialog: other way. I’m gonna cut
dialog: the rope -- have to --~
text: BELOW: The ROPE TWANGS, and HAROLD suddenly drops like a stone
text: onto the ICE SLOPE ten feet below him!
text: Sliding faster and faster, HAROLD SCREAMS, both arms furiously
text: flailing AXES ...
text: ABOVE HIM: TAYLOR breathes a huge sigh of relief as his immediate
text: fate is secured. He braces himself and starts coiling up the
text: rope, methodically counting for length as he does so ....
text: TAYLOR shins down the slope, counting distance as he goes ....
text: TAYLOR arrives somewhere above the CREVASSE, and stares at it in
dialog: disbelief.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Jesus no!
text: He moves as close as he dares to the edge, and SHOUTS into it:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: HAROLD! HAROLD JAMISON!
dialog: 110
text: The wind alone makes it hopeless. And then a MINIATURE AVALANCHE
text: trickles past TAYLOR on his right, and this makes him look up for
text: more trouble. Instead, suspended above him, he sees:
text: Inert HAROLD, crucified on the slope, arms hanging from his two
text: axes, which he has miraculously managed to drive into the snow!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Jesus yes!! HAROLD!!
text: TAYLOR races up the slope to reach HAROLD ...
text: When TAYLOR reaches HAROLD, he finds him virtually unconscious.
text: TAYLOR produces OXYGEN, and applies the MASK to HAROLD'S FACE,
text: Then TAYLOR unhooks the dazed HAROLD, makes him secure on the
text: slope, and forces him to drink.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Open your eyes!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
speaker_heading: (VERY FAINTLY)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: TAYLOR

dialog: 
speaker_heading: 2-DAY 0 106
text: HAROLD goes first again on another long lower. It proceeds
text: quickly and smoothly, but this is more due to the easier terrain
text: than to his state; he is delirious, and seems almost not to know
dialog: where he is.
text: Finally, HAROLD comes to rest on a soft~snowed ledge, and almost
text: unconsciously signals by tugging on the rope. He now collapses
text: onto his good side to rest, and his eyes have closed even before
text: his head has touched the pillow ...
text: TAYLOR reaches him, but can barely get HAROLD to open his eyes.
text: He reaches into the PACK for a secret weapon: a SYRINGE full of
dialog: adrenaline.
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Not now H! We’re nearly there!
dialog: It can’t be too far now -—~ I
dialog: mean -- I dunno exactly where
dialog: the hell we are but -- H! Hey!
text: TAYLOR injects the adrenaline into his friend’s neck, and HAROLD
text: immediately opens his eyes wide. He looks both astonished, and as
text: though he doesn’t know where he is.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: Hey!
text: HAROLD weakly does the Victory handshake, and then oh-so-wearily
text: prepares himself for another excruciating lower, while TAYLOR
text: Just as wearily braces himself to take the weight
text: MALIK stands beside the HELICOPTER SHOUTING something in to the
text: MILITARY PILOT. Also shouting over the windblast:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Come on! We going or not?
text: JACK looks at CLAYBORN, slumped ready for takeoff in his chair.
text: Now MALIK is SHOUTING again to the PILOT, and the PILOT REPLIES.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: WELL?
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: I just ask him how much fuel
dialog: we have to look for Taylor
dialog: and Harold.
dialog: 112
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What? You’re out of your mind!
text: Phillip’s almost unconscious
dialog: here. We’re leaving now!
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: We must make just one pass.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Negative! You want us all to
dialog: get killed?
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: But they might still be alive!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Not where we can get to them.
dialog: Now come on ~ give me a hand!
scene_heading: 108: EXT: HAROLD & T.
dialog: 
text: They are on an easier slope now, one covered by fairly deep snow.
text: HAROLD crawls on his hands and knees, while TAYLOR sometimes does
text: the same, sometimes manages to stagger on his feet. They are
text: roped together again now, although the effect is more symbolic
text: than practical. Sometimes TAYLOR leads, dragging HAROLD along,
dialog: and sometimes the other way round.
text: But HAROLD'S injury means that inevitably he is the weaker, and
text: he is showing definite signs of losing the fight.
text: Eventually TAYLOR starts throwing some things out of his PACK,
text: stuffing others into zip-flaps of his mountain suit. Then he
text: begins to fashion a kind of SLEDGE out of the larger PACK FRAME,
text: to which he lashes HAROLD’S body.
scene_heading: 109 : EXT : BASE CAMP : Day

dialog: closing in -- chopper doesn’t
dialog: leave now, it never will.
speaker_heading: MALIK
dialog: Then we fly one pass — just up

scene_heading: 110: EXT : HAROLD & TAYLOR’S DESCENT DAY
text: Below them, there is an easier sweep of crusted snow. As a new
text: front of ominous CLOUD begins to dirty the sky, TAYLOR begins to
text: laboriously drag HAROLD'S SLEDGE down across the brilliant slope.
text: TAYLOR tugs HAROLD along, ever more slowly. His feet sink deeper
text: now into the snow, and the black CLOUDS are racing closer ....
text: AERIAL SHOT: TAYLOR & HAROLD are tiny, insignificant figures on
text: the great white expanse of the lower reaches of the mountain.
text: TAYLOR is still bravely hauling the sledge, but his movements are
text: jerky now, his speech slurred.
text: ON THE SLEDGE: HAROLD is unconscious ~ or possibly even dead. At
text: one point TAYLOR stops, turns, and trudges back to check on him:

text: The HELICOPTER moves off down the glacier, away from the mountain
text: MALIK sits smoldering beside the PILOT while JACK administers
text: OXYGEN to CLAYBORN. MALIK sticks his head out the window to see
text: K2 being left behind in the distance ..,
text: MALIK now stares at the PILOT ~ and at the PISTOL hanging from
text: his belt. Without further warning MALIK snatches the PISTOL,
text: waves it at the PILOT'S HEAD, and SHOUTS something in Urdu.
text: CU: CLAYBORN’S furious expression as he starts to COUGH again.
dialog: 
text: TAYLOR kneels over HAROLD, who remains totally inert. He listens
text: for signs of his buddy’s breath, but the wind makes it impossible
text: to hear anything. Then TAYLOR looks up...
text: The CLOUDS are just threatening to engulf them completely, when:
speaker_heading: TAYLOR
speaker_heading: (LISTENING KEENLY)
dialog: H! Listen! What’s that noise?
text: TAYLOR strains to see through the gathering mist; something, some

speaker_heading: TAYLOR
dialog: H! What'd I teil ya? Huh?
dialog: Wake up for chrissakes!
text: He dives intd the PACK - produces the ROCKET FLARE - and FIRES

text: And then, around the crest of the RIDGE just to their right, the
text: HELICOPTER suddenly looms into view, engine SCREAMING at its
dialog: absolute altitude limit.
