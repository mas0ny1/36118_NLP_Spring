text: FADE IN on a composite glass shot over the Hoboken docks -
text: New York Skyline dimly seen in background. Snow. Sounds of
text: tugboat whistles. DISSOLVE TO -
text: Ship's side gangway slopes up out of picture.
text: Weston, a theatrical agent, comes along wharf, peering at
text: ship. He is fifty, heavy, slow, but with a shrewd eye. He
text: turns up his collar and shivers, stops and looks at ship
text: doubtfully.
text: An old watchman comes along wharf from opposite side,

speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: Hey, Is this the moving picture
dialog: ship?
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: The Venture? Yep.
dialog: (Weston starts for
dialog: gangway)
dialog: You going on this crazy voyage?
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: (pausing)
dialog: What's crazy about it?
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: I dunno know, but I hear everybody
dialog: talkin' about this crazy feller
dialog: that's running it.
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: Carl Denham?
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: Guess that's the name. They say he
dialog: ain't scare of nothin' - if he
text: wants a picture of a lion he walks
text: right up and tells it to look
dialog: pleasant.
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: He's a tough egg, all right. But
dialog: why the talk about this voyage
dialog: being crazy?
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: Wal, there's talk around the docks
dialog: about the cargo for one thing. And
dialog: I never see a ship this size with
dialog: such a crew.
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: Not enough men to handle her?
speaker_heading: WATCHMAN
dialog: Not enough! The crew's three times
dialog: too big for the ship. I dunno know
dialog: where they find enough room to
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (from above deck)
dialog: Hey, there! What do you want?
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: Denham aboard?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
text: (comes down gangway into
dialog: picture)
dialog: Yes. Who are you?
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: I want to see him. I'm Weston, the
dialog: agent.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Come aboard. Denham's getting wild.
dialog: Hope you have some good news for
dialog: him.
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - NIGHT
text: Denham and Englehorn talking.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Well, Mr. Denham, you know the
dialog: reasons for hurrying as well as I
dialog: do. The insurance company has found
dialog: out we're carrying explosives, and
dialog: the Marshal will be aboard tomorrow
dialog: or next day.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: I suppose if we make a legal case
dialog: of it, we'll be tied up for months.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
text: With ship's articles falsified and
dialog: ammunition enough aboard to blow up
dialog: the harbor?
dialog: (he takes a bomb from case
dialog: on floor)
dialog: And what do you think the Marshall
dialog: will say to these new gas-bombs?
dialog: According to you one of them is
dialog: powerful enough to knock out an
dialog: elephant.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (pacing up and down)
dialog: We've got to get to where we're
text: going before the monsoon starts.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: You can trust me to get you through
dialog: a blow, I hope.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Don't get sore, Skipper. But you
dialog: know what it means to hit the
dialog: tropical rainy season when we're
dialog: making an outdoor picture. Months
dialog: wasted, money gone, and nothing to
dialog: show for it.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: But still you always bring back a
dialog: picture and everyone says, "There
dialog: is only one Carl Denham."
text: Driscoll and Weston come in.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Weston! I was just going ashore to
dialog: ring you up.
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: If I'd known that, I'd have waited.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Meet the Skipper.
dialog: (to Englehorn)
dialog: This is Weston, the theatrical
dialog: agent.
dialog: (they shake hands)
dialog: And this is Driscoll, the first
dialog: mate. Well, where's the girl,
dialog: Weston?
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: It can't be done, Denham.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: What? It's got to done.
text: (Weston shakes his head in
dialog: silence)
dialog: Look here, Weston. The Actor's
dialog: Equity and the Hays outfit have
dialog: interfered with every girl I've
dialog: tried to hire; now every agent in
dialog: town has shut down on me. All but
dialog: you. You know I'm square -
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: Everybody knows you're square,
dialog: Denham but you've got a reputation
dialog: for recklessness that can't be
dialog: glossed over. And then you're so
dialog: secretive.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: I'll say so.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: When even the skipper and the mate
dialog: don't know where they're going --
dialog: (he shrugs)
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: There you are. I've got a
dialog: conscience, Denham. I can't send a
dialog: young, pretty girl, such as you
dialog: want, on a job like this without
dialog: telling her what to expect.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: And what is she to expect?
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: To go off for no one knows how
dialog: long, to some place you won't even
text: hint at, the only woman on a ship
dialog: with the toughest mugs I ever
dialog: looked at.
dialog: (they all laugh)
dialog: I mean the crew.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Good Lord, you'd think I never
dialog: brought anybody back alive! The
text: Skipper and Driscoll have stuck by
dialog: me on two trips. They seem healthy.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Sure we're healthy.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: But it's different taking a girl
dialog: into danger.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Oh, I suppose there's no danger in
dialog: New York? Why, there are dozens of
dialog: girls in this town tonight in more
dialog: danger than they'd ever see with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (drily)
dialog: Sure. But they know that kind of
dialog: danger.
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: You never had a woman in your other
dialog: pictures, why do you want one in
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Holy mackerel D'ye think I want to
dialog: haul a woman along?
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: Then why - ?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Because the public - bless 'em -
text: must have a pretty face to look at.
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: Everybody likes romance.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Isn't there any romance or
dialog: adventure in the world without a
dialog: flapper in it?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Well, Mr. Denham, why not make a
dialog: picture in a monastery?
dialog: (they all laugh)
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: It makes me sore. I go out and
text: sweat blood to make a swell
text: picture, and then the exhibitors
dialog: and critics all say, "if this
dialog: picture had a love interest, it
dialog: would gross twice as much." All
dialog: right, the public wants a girl, and
dialog: this time I'll give 'em what they
dialog: want.
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: (rising)
dialog: I don't know where you'll get her.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Weston, I've got to. We've got to
dialog: sail on the morning tide - we've
dialog: got to be out of here by daylight -
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Well - there's a good reason.
speaker_heading: WESTON
dialog: Everything I hear makes me like
dialog: this thing less. I'm glad I didn't
dialog: get you a girl.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: You are, eh? Well, I'll show you.
dialog: If you think I'm going to give up
dialog: just because you can't find a girl
dialog: with a backbone --
text: (he is struggling into his
dialog: overcoat)
dialog: -- I'm going to make the greatest
dialog: picture in the world, something
dialog: that's never been seen or dreamed
dialog: of. They'll have to invent some new
dialog: adjectives when I come back.
dialog: (he is at the door)
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: I'm going to bring back a girl for
dialog: my picture -- if I have to marry
dialog: one!
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO Long Shot - Broadway at night - stock
text: CUT TO Denham walking along, scanning faces as he walks.
text: DISSOLVES of faces of women, Broadway types, bold,
text: indifferent, heavy, ugly - most of them heavily painted.
text: Rapidly passing, as though the camera were Denham looking
text: them over.
text: CUT TO Denham. He shakes his head disgustedly, stops, wheels
text: around and starts in another direction, as though he's given
dialog: up that part of town, and thought of another possibility.
text: DISSOLVE TO Exterior of a Woman's Mission. A bread-line
text: waiting. Camera moves slowly down the line of faces as
text: thought Denham were looking them over.
text: CUT TO Denham. He shrugs his shoulders in despair, turns
dialog: away.
text: DISSOLVE TO Exterior of one of those Small Wooden Stands you
text: see in the West Forties, a fruit-tobacco and candy shop just
text: big enough for the proprietor and one customer to get into, a
text: stand of fruit and peanut-roaster on sidewalk. Denham comes
text: along, takes out cigarette case, it's empty, he goes in to
text: buy some. We see through window that he is taking cigarettes
text: and paying the Greek proprietor.
text: Ann Darrow comes slowly into picture; she hesitates, her hand
text: goes stealthily toward a piece of fruit.
text: She is fingering it when the Greek dashes out and seizes her.
text: She tries to pull her arm away. Denham comes out of shop.
speaker_heading: GREEK
dialog: (very excited)
dialog: Ah-ha! I catch you, you stealer! I
dialog: catch the cop - you like that, ha!
speaker_heading: ANN
text: (she keeps her head bent,
text: struggling weakly to pull
dialog: away)
dialog: No-no, I didn't. Please let me go.
dialog: I wanted to, but I didn't.
speaker_heading: GREEK
dialog: I had enough dese stealers --
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Oh, dry up. The kid didn't take
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I didn't, truly I didn't.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: So, shut up, Socrates. Here's a
dialog: dollar. Forget it.
text: The Greek takes the money and releases Ann who stumbles back
text: against Denham. He catches her round the shoulders and she
text: half-collapses. Her head falls back on his arm. He has his
text: first sight of her face.
text: CLOSE UP Ann, her eyes open as she looks up at Denham,
text: terrified.
text: MEDIUM SHOT - Denham, holding Ann. He looks at her. Suddenly
text: his face lights up, he snaps his fingers triumphantly.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (looking up the street)
dialog: Hi! Taxi!
text: DISSOLVE TO a one-armed lunch room. Tiled wall, two chairs.
text: Ann has emptied plate and coffee mug on arm of her chair.
text: Denham in other chair watching her. She sighs happily over
text: having satisfied her hunger, and leans back.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Feeling better?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Yes, thank you. You're very kind.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Don't fool yourself. I'm not
dialog: bothering with you just out of
dialog: kindness.
text: (Ann opens her eyes wide,
dialog: half-puzzled, half
dialog: afraid)
dialog: How come you're in this fix?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Bad luck I guess. There are lots of
dialog: girls just like me.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: There aren't such a lot who've got
dialog: your looks.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (laughing it off)
dialog: Oh, I can get by in good clothes.
dialog: But when a girl gets too shabby --
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: No family?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'm supposed to have an uncle
dialog: somewhere.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Ever do any acting?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I used to do some extra jobs over
dialog: at Fort Lee sometimes. Once I got a
text: real part. The studio is shut down
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: What's you name?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Ann Darrow.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Are you one of these city gals who
text: screams at a mouse and faints at a
dialog: snake?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No, of course not. I'm a country
dialog: gal - or used to be.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Listen, sister. I've got a job for
dialog: you. The costumes I've got on board
dialog: will fit you.
text: (looks at his watch)
dialog: The Broadway shops will still be
dialog: open. I'll get you some clothes for
dialog: yourself. Come on.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: But - but what is it?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (excited)
dialog: It's money, and adventure, and
dialog: fame.
dialog: It's the thrill of a lifetime. And
text: a long sea-voyage that starts at
text: six tomorrow morning.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: No! Wait, I can't - I don't
dialog: understand - you must tell me - I
dialog: do want the job so - I was starving
dialog: - but I can't -
text: Denham has been looking at her, puzzled because she hasn't
text: caught his frantic excitement. He suddenly sees what is
text: troubling her. He calms down and goes back and sits.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Oh, I see. You got me wrong. Nix,
dialog: sister, nix. This is strictly
dialog: business. I'm no chaser.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (meekly)
dialog: I only wanted to -
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Sure. Sure you did. I dot excited
dialog: and forgot you didn't understand
dialog: it. Listen, I'm Carl Denham. Ever
dialog: hear of me?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Ye-es. Yes. You make moving
text: pictures. In jungles and places.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: That's right. And I've picked you
dialog: for the lead in my next picture. We
dialog: sail at six.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: A long way from here. Think, Ann, a
dialog: long voyage, easy living, the warm
text: blue sea, moonlight on the water -
dialog: isn't that better than tramping New
dialog: York trying to keep out of the
text: gutter.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (almost whispers)
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: I'm square, Ann. And I'll be square
dialog: with you. No funny business.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: What do I have to go?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
text: (leaning over her chair
text: and looking straight at
dialog: her)
dialog: Trust me. And keep your chin up.
text: Ann looks at him for a moment, then he holds out his hand.
text: She takes it and they shake. FADE OUT.
text: FADE IN - deck of ship at dawn, getting under way. Crew busy
text: casting off lines, moving stuff on deck. A tug is puffing
text: alongside. Driscoll on fo'c'sle head directing.
text: MEDIUM SHOT - Ann in same dress, but wearing a heavy loose
text: coat Denham has bought her. She climbs to fo'c'sle head,
dialog: watching this strange new world.
text: Driscoll backs into scene without seeing her. He is shouting
text: at a sailor.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Carry that line aft! Aft, you
dialog: farmer! Back there!
text: He swings his arm round behind him in a violent full-armed
text: gesture and hits Ann in the face. She staggers back against
text: the rail and nearly falls.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Who the -- What are you going up
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: ANN
text: (meekly, hand to her face)
dialog: I just wanted to see!
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (gruffly)
dialog: Well, I'm sorry. You're the girl
dialog: Denham found at the last minute,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Yes. I'm - I'm awfully excited.
dialog: It's all so strange, and I've never
dialog: been on a ship before.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: And I've never been on a ship with
text: a woman before.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I guess you don't think much of
dialog: women on ships, do you?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: No. They're a cock-eyed nuisance.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'll try not to be.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: You got in the way already. Better
dialog: stay below.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: What! The whole voyage!
dialog: (she smiles at him)
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
text: (hesitates, then says in a
dialog: softened tone -)
dialog: Say, I didn't apologize very good
dialog: for hitting you. That was an awful
text: sock in the jaw.
text: Driscoll stares at her doubtfully, she looks up and meets his
text: gaze. Their eyes hold for a moment, then two short toots from
text: a tug alongside, answered by one blast from the ship.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Well, we're off.
speaker_heading: ANN
text: (clasping her hands and
dialog: peering into the mist)
dialog: We're off.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO - Long shot - Miniature ship at sea - DAY
text: DISSOLVE TO - The deck of the ship at sea. A calm tropical
text: afternoon. Ann and Charley, the Chinese cook, at rail.
text: Charley with enormous tub of potatoes, peeling them. Ann
text: making an intricate knot with a bit of rope's end, fooling
text: with it as she talks.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Charley, how many potatoes do you
dialog: suppose you've peeled since we left
dialog: New York six weeks ago?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Too many.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Sailors eat an awful lot, don't
dialog: they?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: All time eat. No can fill up. Some
dialog: day my go back to China, never see
dialog: no more potato.
text: Ann finishes the knot and tugs at it.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: There. That's fourteen knots I've
dialog: learned to tie.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Pretty soon now you be same sailor.
dialog: Only don't eat so much.
speaker_heading: ANN
text: (laughs, then looks around
text: with a contented sigh)
dialog: I'd like to be a sailor. Isn't the
dialog: sea wonderful!
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: (drily)
dialog: Oh yes, very pretty.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Of course it wasn't so nice up
dialog: north when it was cold and rough.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: Ocean very fine when you order
dialog: weather how you like all same like
dialog: eggs for breakfast.
text: Driscoll strolls in. Charley gets up and moves away.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Hello, Ann.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Hello, Jack.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Where have you been all morning?
speaker_heading: ANN
text: Trying on costumes for Mr. Denham.
dialog: He's going to make some tests of me
dialog: this afternoon, here on deck, when
text: the light's right.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Tests? Why?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Oh - to see which side of my face
dialog: looks best - and all that.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (very gruff)
dialog: Both sides looks all right to me.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yes, but you're not the movie
dialog: director.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: If I was, you wouldn't be here.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Well, that's a nice thing to say.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: It's no place for a girl.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: I wish you wouldn't keep harping on
dialog: that. It's very mean of you.
dialog: Anybody'd think I'd been a lot of
dialog: trouble.
text: Driscoll grunts.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (very cross)
dialog: I haven't! You can't say I've been
dialog: one bit of trouble to anyone.
text: Driscoll is silent.
speaker_heading: ANN
text: (looks at him, waits, then
dialog: anxiously)
dialog: Have I?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Sure you have.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I don't see - Well, how?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Just your being here's a trouble.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (mournfully)
dialog: Oh dead. I thought everything was
dialog: going to nicely.
text: Driscoll looks at her downcast expression, wiggles
text: uncomfortably and at last blurts an attempt at consolation.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Aw, you're swell. Women can't help
dialog: being a bother. I guess they're
dialog: made that way.
text: Oddly enough, this doesn't cheer her up very much. But she
text: draws a long breath and smiles.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Well, anyhow, I've had the happiest
dialog: time of my life on this old ship.
text: Driscoll is a little touched by this. He gives her a quick
text: look and says awkwardly -
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Why - that's fine.
text: A little pause. Driscoll thinks it over.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: D'ye really mean that, Ann?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Of course. Everyone's so nice to me
dialog: - Mr. Denham and the Skipper -
dialog: Don't you think the Skipper is a
dialog: sweet old lamb?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: I'd hate to have him hear me say
dialog: so.
text: Ann laughs and picks up Ignatz, the monkey, who cuddles down
text: in her lap contentedly.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Ignatz is nice to me too. He likes
dialog: me better than he does anyone else
dialog: on board, don't you Iggy?
text: Denham approaches them.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Beauty and the Beast.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Well, I never thought I was
dialog: handsome, but -
dialog: (they all laugh)
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Go put on a costume, Ann. Light's
dialog: good for those tests now.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I won't be a minute, Mr. Denham.
text: She puts down Ignatz and goes. Denham scratches Ignatz' head,
text: watches him for moment.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (half aloud)
dialog: Beauty and the Beast.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Mr. Denham, I've going to do some
text: butting-in.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: What's your trouble, Driscoll?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: When do we find out where we're
dialog: going?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Pretty soon now.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Are you going to tell us what
dialog: happens when we get there?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: How can I? I'm no fortune-teller.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: But hang it, you must have some
dialog: idea what you're after.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Going soft on me, Jack?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: You know I'm not for myself. But
dialog: Ann --
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Oh you've gone soft on her? I've
dialog: got enough on my hands without a
dialog: love affair to complicate things.
dialog: Better cut it out, Jack
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (sullenly)
dialog: Love affair! You think I'm going to
dialog: fall for any dams?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (musing)
dialog: It never fails. Some big hard
text: boiled egg goes goofy over a pretty
text: face, and bingo! He cracks up and
text: gets sappy.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Who's getting sappy? I haven't run
dialog: out on you, have I?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Nope. You're a good tough guy,
dialog: Jack. But if beauty gets you --
text: (he stops, then laughs a
dialog: little)
dialog: Why, I'm going right into a theme
dialog: song!
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (sulky)
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: It's the idea for my picture. The
dialog: Beast was a tough guy, Jack. He
dialog: could lick the world. But when he
dialog: saw Beauty, she got him. He went
dialog: soft, he forgot his wisdom, and the
dialog: little fellers licked him. Think it
text: over, Jack.
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: (coming up)
dialog: Mr. Denham, the Skipper says will
dialog: you please come up on the bridge?
dialog: We've reached the position you
dialog: marked, he says.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Come on, Jack. You're in on this.
dialog: I'm going to spill it.
text: DISSOLVE TO bridge. Englehorn leaning over chart; Denham and
text: Driscoll across table.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: (pointing with dividers)
dialog: Here's your noon position. 2 South,
dialog: 90 East; you promised me some
dialog: information when we reached these
dialog: latitudes.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (looking at chart)
dialog: 'Way west of Sumatra.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: And way out of any waters I know. I
dialog: know the East Indies like my own
dialog: hand, but I was never here.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: Where do we go from here?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: South-West.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: South-West! But there is nothing -
text: nothing for thousands of miles.
dialog: What about food? So many in the
text: crew makes the food melt away. And
dialog: water? And coal?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Take it easy, Skipper. We're not
text: going thousands of miles.
text: (he takes a wallet from
text: his breast pocket and
text: very carefully opens two
dialog: pieces of paper - spreads
text: over on table before
dialog: Englehorn)
dialog: That's the island we're looking
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: The position --
text: (he leans down,
dialog: straightens up)
dialog: I'll get the big chart.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: You won't find that island on any
dialog: chart. That one there was made up
text: by the skipper of a Norwegian
dialog: Barque.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: He was kidding.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: No. Listen. A canoe with natives
dialog: from this island was blown out to
dialog: sea. When the barque picked them
text: up, there was only one alive. He
dialog: died before they reached port, but
dialog: not before the skipper had pieced
dialog: together a description of the
dialog: island and got a fairly good idea
dialog: of where it lies.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Where did you get hold of it?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Two years ago, in Singapore, going
dialog: home from my last trip. I've known
dialog: that skipper for years. He knew I'd
dialog: be interested.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Does he believe it himself?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: I don't know. But I do. See, here's
dialog: what the island looks like.
text: He unfolds second piece of paper.
text: INSERT crude sketch of island, Denham's hand pointing to
text: various features. Float Denham's voice.
speaker_heading: DENHAM (V.O.)
dialog: Here's a long sandy peninsula. The
dialog: only possible landing place is
dialog: through this reef. The rest of the
dialog: shore-line is sheer precipice,
text: hundreds of feet high. And across
dialog: the base of that peninsula, cutting
text: it off from the rest of the island,
text: is a wall.
text: CUT TO Med. Shot - Denham, Driscoll, Englehorn. They stare at
dialog: Denham.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: A wall?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Built so long ago that the people
dialog: who live there now have slipped
dialog: back, forgotten the high
dialog: civilization that built it. But
dialog: it's as strong today as it was
dialog: centuries ago. The natives keep
dialog: that wall in repair. They need it.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
text: There's something on the other side
dialog: - something they fear.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
text: A hostile tribe.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (drawing a long breath)
dialog: Did you ever hear of -- KONG?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Why -- yes. Some Malay
dialog: superstition. A god or a spirit or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Anyway, neither beast nor man.
text: Monstrous, all-powerful -- still
dialog: living, still holding that island
text: in the grip of deadly fear.
text: Englehorn and Driscoll look skeptical.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Every legend has a basis of truth.
dialog: I tell you there's something on
dialog: that island that no white man has
dialog: ever seen.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: And you expect to photograph it?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: If it's there, you bet I'll
dialog: photograph it.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (very skeptical)
dialog: Suppose it doesn't like having it's
dialog: picture taken?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Well, now you know why I brought
dialog: those cases of gas-bombs.
text: Driscoll and Englehorn stare at Denham, then look at each
text: other. Englehorn shrugs, reaches for the homemade chart.
text: DISSOLVE TO- Exterior forward deck of ship - Day. Denham has
text: camera set up. Ann comes in, in Beauty and Beast costume.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Oh, you picked out the Beauty and
dialog: the Beast costume!
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: It's the prettiest.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: All right. Stand over there.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'm sort of nervous. Suppose I
dialog: don't photograph well?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (busy with camera)
dialog: Don't let that worry you.
dialog: If I hadn't been sure of that, I
dialog: wouldn't have brought you half way
dialog: round the world.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: What shall I do?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (squints through the
text: viewfinder, throws camera
dialog: over and locks it)
dialog: Now when I start cranking hold it a
text: minute, then turn slowly toward me.
dialog: Look at me, look surprised, then
dialog: smile a little, listen and then
dialog: laugh. All right, camera.
text: She does as he has said.
text: CUT TO fo'c'sle head, several members of crew peering out,
text: watching with great interest. Charley among them.
speaker_heading: 1ST SAILOR
dialog: Looks kinda silly, don't it?
speaker_heading: 2ND SAILOR
dialog: She's sure a pretty dame.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: You think maybe he like take my
dialog: picture, huh?
speaker_heading: 1ST SAILOR
dialog: Them camera cost money. Shouldn't
dialog: think he'd risk it.
dialog: CUT TO Denham and Ann
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: That was fine. I'm going to try a
dialog: filter on this one.
text: (he fusses around,
dialog: changing lens, etc.)
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Do you always take the pictures
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Ever since a trip I made to Africa.
dialog: I'd have got a swell picture of a
text: charging rhino, but the cameraman
dialog: got scared. The damned fool. I was
text: right there with a rifle.
dialog: Seemed he didn't trust me to get
dialog: the rhino before it got him. I
dialog: haven't fooled with cameramen
dialog: since. Do the trick myself.
text: CUT TO the bridge. Englehorn and Driscoll leaning over,
text: watching Ann and Denham.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Think he's crazy, Skipper?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Just enthusiastic!
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: But this yarn about unknown islands
dialog: and monstrous gods --
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: He pays us well to take him where
dialog: he wants to go. If the island
dialog: exists, we will find it.
text: CUT TO Denham and Ann.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Now Ann, stand there. Look down.
text: When I start to crank, look up
dialog: slowly. You're quite calm, don't
dialog: expect to see anything. Follow my
dialog: directions. All right -- camera.
text: He cranks. He gets more excited through this scene, trying to
dialog: force her to feel the emotions he wants.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Now -- look up. Slowly. You see
dialog: nothing yet. Look higher. Still
dialog: higher. That's it. Now you see it.
dialog: You're amazed. You can't believe
dialog: it. Your eyes open wider. It's
dialog: horrible, but you can't look away.
dialog: What is it Ann? What can you do?
dialog: No chances for you, no escape.
dialog: Helpless, Ann, you're helpless. One
dialog: chance -- if you can scream. Your
text: throat's paralyzed. Try to scream,
dialog: Ann. Try. If you didn't see,
dialog: perhaps you could scream. Throw you
dialog: arms across your eyes, and scream,
dialog: Ann, scream for your life!
text: She has followed his directions.
text: CUT TO bridge. Driscoll and Englehorn, watching Denham and
text: Ann. Ann's scream floats.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (grasping Englehorn's arm)
dialog: What's he think she's really going
dialog: to see?
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
text: FADE IN, bridge in fog, outside wheel-house. Denham, Ann,
text: Driscoll, Englehorn, at rail peering ahead. Through this
text: dialogue intercut shots of look-out in bow, man in crows
text: nest, sailor heaving lead, and sailors clustered at bulwarks
text: on main deck, watching for island.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: This infernal fog! Sure of your
dialog: position, Skipper?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: (very nervous, but
dialog: offended at suggestion)
dialog: Of course. Last night, before the
dialog: fog shut down, I got a good sight.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: We must be near the island.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: If we don't see it when this fog
dialog: lifts we never shall. We've
dialog: quartered these parts.
text: CUT TO sailor with lead. He lets go, line runs through his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: No bottom at 30 fathoms!
text: CUT TO bridge as before.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: Of course that Norwegian skipper
text: was guessing at the position.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: How will we know it's the right
dialog: island?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (very tense, answering
dialog: mechanically)
text: The mountain that looks like a
dialog: skull.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Yes. I'd forgotten. You told me
dialog: that. Skull Mountain.
speaker_heading: SAILOR'S VOICE
dialog: Bottom! 20 fathoms!
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
text: Shallowing fast, Driscoll, dead
dialog: slow.
text: Driscoll goes to telegraph, sounds of bells to engine-room
dialog: and reply.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Curse the fog!
speaker_heading: SAILOR'S VOICE
dialog: Sixteen fathoms!
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: What does she draw, Skipper?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Six.
text: No one ever looks at person addressed. All eyes ahead,
text: straining through fog.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Listen! Hear anything?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: No.
text: There is a slight pause.
scene_heading: MAN IN CROWS NEST
dialog: Breakers ahead!
text: Englehorn jumps for telegraph.
speaker_heading: SAILOR'S VOICE
dialog: Ten fathoms!
text: Jingle of telegraph, noise of reversing engines.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (bellowing at fo'c'sle)
dialog: Let go!
text: Rattle of anchor chain through hawse-pipe, splash of anchor,
text: more jingle of telegraph. After noise dies down, Driscoll
dialog: speaks:
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: That's not breakers. That's drums.
text: A long distant mutter of drums rolling. DISSOLVE TO:
text: Boats being lowered, Bos'n giving orders.
text: CUT TO bridge, Englehorn with binocular. Denham, Ann and
dialog: Driscoll.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Well, Skipper, see anybody?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Not a living thing. I think there
text: are more houses in the thick bush.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Funny they haven't spotted us. I
dialog: think the whole population would be
text: on the beach.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Listen.
text: The faint throbbing of drums.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Maybe they have seen us and are
dialog: signalling. Well, Skipper, do you
dialog: believe me now? There's Skull
dialog: Mountain, the wall - everything
dialog: just like my funny map. Come on,
dialog: let's get started.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Twelve men go with you. The rest
dialog: stay aboard.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Who's in charge of the gas bombs?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Jimmy. That young feller.
dialog: (points down on deck)
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Good. Leave the 2nd Mate aboard,
dialog: Skipper. I need you, you may be
dialog: able to talk to these birds ashore.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'm going ashore with you, aren't
dialog: I?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: You bet.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: She ought not to go till we find
dialog: out what goes on --
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (good-naturedly)
dialog: Say, who's running this show? I've
dialog: learned by experience to keep my
text: cast and my cameras right with me.
dialog: You never can tell when you'll want
dialog: 'em.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: But it's crazy to risk --
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Oh, go on, Jack. Get busy. Deal out
dialog: the rifles and ammunition. And pick
dialog: me a couple of huskies to carry my
dialog: stuff.
text: Driscoll goes reluctantly. Denham shakes his head over him,
dialog: then Ann.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Bring the costume box. We might get
dialog: a swell shot right away if we're
dialog: lucky.
text: DISSOLVE TO shot of beach, boats approaching. Village and
text: wall glassed.
text: DISSOLVE TO shot from beach, showing loaded boats
text: approaching.
text: Drums louder, of course.
text: CUT TO boats beaching, people getting out, uploading stuff.
text: Denham puts camera on tripod, one sailor shoulders it,
text: another with magazine case, third with costume box, fourth
text: and fifth with trade-goods in boxes. Jimmy with case of
dialog: bombs.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: You fellers with the camera stay
dialog: close to me. Where's Jimmy with the
dialog: bombs?
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Here, sir.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: All right. Stick around. And watch
dialog: your step. There's enough
dialog: trichloride in that case to put a
text: herd of hippos to sleep.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Aye Aye, sir.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: What queer-looking boats.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
text: Outrigger canoes.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
text: Driscoll, have two men stay with
dialog: the boat.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: All attended to, sir.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Now, all set? Ready, Skipper?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: (coming up)
dialog: Ready.
text: They start up the beach.
text: CUT TO village. Wall visible over roofs. Party enters.
text: Drums much louder.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
text: Not a soul in sight.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: That wall, Skipper! What d'ye say
dialog: to that, eh?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Colossal! It might almost be
dialog: Egyptian.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: But what's on the other side?
dialog: That's what I want to know.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (awe-struck)
dialog: Who do you suppose could have built
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (trying not to be
dialog: impressed)
dialog: Aw, I went up to Angkor once.
dialog: That's bigger than this - and
dialog: nobody knows who built it.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (with a feeling of
dialog: something even more
dialog: important than a picture
text: pending, but trying to
dialog: strike his usual note)
dialog: Oh, boy! What a chance! What a
dialog: picture!
text: The chant begins, rising in volume. They all stand frozen.
text: Ann clutches Driscoll's arm. Sailors frightened. Chant dies
text: down to a mutter.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: (shaking himself)
dialog: Come on!
text: They all move forward cautiously. TRUCK WITH THEM.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Hear that! They're saying Kong!
dialog: Kong!
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Hope you'll be able to speak their
dialog: lingo Skipper.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Can you catch any words yet?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: I'm not sure. It sounds something
dialog: like the language the Nias
dialog: Islanders speak.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: What do you suppose is happening?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Up to some of their heathen tricks.
dialog: Now don't go rushing out to see.
speaker_heading: ANN
text: (meekly, but bubbling with
dialog: excitement)
dialog: All right. But isn't it exciting!
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Sure. I wish we'd left you on the
dialog: ship.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'm so glad you didn't.
text: They approach masking house.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Wait. Easy row. Stay here till I
dialog: see what goes on.
text: They stop in a group behind house. Denham looks round
dialog: cautiously.
text: CUT TO what he sees. The Ceremony.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Holy mackerel! What a show!
dialog: Skipper, get a look at this!
text: Englehorn carefully goes forward and peeps around.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Did you ever see anything like that
dialog: before? If I can steal a shot
dialog: before they see us -
text: He beckons to sailor carrying camera.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Hey! You with the camera!
text: Sailor starts forward with it.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (to Driscoll)
dialog: I want to see.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Come on and look, but be careful.
text: Ann looks around house. Denham moves beyond and starts
text: setting up. Chant begins to rise. As it reaches forte, Chief
text: sees them and shouts.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Bado! Dama pati vego!
text: Ceremony stops, natives turn and stare.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Too late, they see us.
speaker_heading: JIMMY
dialog: Let's beat it!
text: He turns to run. Driscoll seizes and holds him.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Hold on there! What are you running
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: No use trying to hide now.
dialog: Everybody come out here in plain
text: sight. Put up a bold front.
text: Driscoll, Ann and sailors come forward in a group a few paces
text: behind Denham and Englehorn.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Bado! Maka mini tau ansaro.(Wait!
dialog: Two warriors come with me.)
text: In silence, the Chief with two warriors close behind him
text: advances through the crowd of natives. The women in the crowd
text: begin to slip away.
text: The group of whites watch in tense silence the approach of
dialog: the Chief.
speaker_heading: 2ND SAILOR
dialog: Say, let's scram outa this.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Stand still, you fool!
text: Group of sailors are fingering their rifles, shifting
dialog: nervously.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
text: (over his shoulder without
dialog: looking away from Chief)
dialog: Steady, boys. Don't get nervous.
text: Ann takes hold of Driscoll's arm. He puts his hand on hers
text: without looking at her.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Never let a native see you're
dialog: worried, boys. Bluff 'em.
text: The chief stops.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Watu! Tama di? Tama di? (Stop! Who
dialog: are you? Who are you?)
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Come on Skipper, make him a
dialog: friendly speech.
dialog: (advance)
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Tabe! Bala kum nono hi. Bala! Bala!
dialog: (Greeting! We are your friends.
dialog: Friends! Friends!)
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: (sternly)
dialog: Bala reri! Tasko! Tasko! (We don't
dialog: want friends, Go! Get out!
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: He understands you, Skipper! What's
dialog: he say?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Telling us to get out.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Talk him out of it. Ask him what
text: goes on.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Vana di humya? Malem ani humya
dialog: vana? (What are you doing? What is
dialog: that woman doing?)
dialog: (he points to girl)
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Ani saba Kong! (She is the bride of
dialog: Kong!)
text: The natives all murmur "Saba Kong!"
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: He says the girl there is the bride
dialog: of Kong.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Great! Find out what they're going
dialog: to do.
text: The Witch Doctor rushes forward, very angry. He addresses
dialog: Chief.
speaker_heading: WITCH DOCTOR
dialog: Dama si kasi! Dama si kasi! Punya
dialog: bas! Punya! (Strangers have seen!
dialog: It is finished.)
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: (to Englehorn)
dialog: Tasko! (Go!)
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: He must be the witch-doctor. He
dialog: says the ceremony is spoiled
dialog: because we have seen it.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: What's the word for friends?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Bala.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Calm the old boy down.
text: He advances with outspread hands, saying, "Bala! Bala!"
text: Englehorn hesitates for a moment, then steps forward too.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: (bellowing)
dialog: Punya!
text: The warriors move menacingly forward.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: I don't like the looks of this,
text: Denham. The women have cleared out.
dialog: That's a bad sign.
text: The Chief sees Ann.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: (shouting to the natives)
dialog: Sita! Malem! Malem me pakeno!
dialog: (Look! The woman! The woman of
dialog: gold!)
text: Natives all look at her and murmur.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
text: He says look at the golden woman.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Blondes are scarce around here.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Malem ma pakapo! Kong wa bisa! Kow
dialog: bisa para Kong! (The woman of gold!
dialog: Kong's gift! A gift for Kong.)
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
text: A gift for Kong, he says.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Good Lord!
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Dama, tebo malem na hi? (Strangers,
dialog: sell woman to us?)
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Wants to buy her.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Sani sita malem ati -
dialog: (pointing to sacrificial
dialog: victim)
dialog: - kow dia malem ma pakeno.
dialog: (I will give six women like this
dialog: for you woman of gold.)
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: He's offering to trade us six of
dialog: his girls for Ann.
text: Ann gasps, tries to smile.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: You got her into this, Denham.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Tida, tida! Malem ati rota na hi.
dialog: (No, no! Our woman stays with us.)
text: Chief growls menacingly. Warriors take another step forward.
text: Sailors finger their rifles.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: I'm going to take her back to the
dialog: ship.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: We'd better all get out before they
dialog: think to cut us off from the beach.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: I guess so. But tell him we'll come
dialog: back tomorrow to make friends.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Dulu hi tego. Bala. Dulu. (Tomorrow
dialog: we come. Friends. Tomorrow.)
text: Chief does not move, glares at them.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Get going, Ann. Don't act scared.
dialog: Everything's all right. Smile, Ann.
dialog: Talk to Jack. Keep your chin up!
text: Ann, very frightened, but smiling gallantly, does as he tell
text: her. She and Driscoll retreat slowly, pretending unconcern.
text: The sailors fall back one by one, Englehorn and Denham last.
text: Denham cocks his hat over one eye and begins to whistle
text: carelessly, one hand on his revolver. As they reach the
text: corner of masking house.
text: DISSOLVE TO deck in moonlight - Ann and Charley on hatch.
speaker_heading: ANN
text: -- and an enormous wall, Charley,
dialog: all the way across that piece of
dialog: land where we went ashore.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: What fashion that girl do -- that
dialog: girl with flowers on her?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: The poor thing, she looked -- as
dialog: though she was too frightened to
dialog: feel frightened. You know?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: (nodding wisely)
dialog: Sacrifice.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: The Chief said she was the bride of
dialog: Kong. Charley, what do you suppose
dialog: Kong is?
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: My guess he very big joss this
dialog: place. People here plenty scared.
dialog: You don't worry. No can help.
text: Ignatz gallops past.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Oh, there's Ignatz! He's broken
text: loose again.
text: Charley grabs at him and misses. Ignatz goes down the deck.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Catch him, Charley. He'll get in
text: the cabins and break things.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: My catch him. Bad devil, come here.
text: He goes off in pursuit. Ann watches, laughing.
text: CUT TO Sailor on watch in bow. He looks round, yawns, sits
text: down and makes himself comfortable.
text: CUT TO Ann on hatch. Driscoll enters.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Why aren't you in bed?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I can't sleep. Those drums make me
dialog: nervous, I guess.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: I think Denham's off his nut,
dialog: taking you ashore today.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I was -- sort of scared there for a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Huh! You weren't the only one.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I wonder what we do next?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: That's what's worrying me. Denham's
dialog: such a fool for risks. No telling
dialog: what he'll ask you to do.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: After what he did for me, I'll do
dialog: anything he wants.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Don't talk like that. When it comes
dialog: to getting a picture, he's crazy
dialog: enough to try anything.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I won't go back on him.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: When I think what might have
dialog: happened today -- if anything
dialog: happened to you.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Why then you wouldn't be bothered
text: with a woman on board.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (very staccato)
dialog: Don't laugh. I'm scared for you.
dialog: I'm sort of - I'm scared of you,
dialog: too. Ann, I -- I guess I love you.
text: They look at each other, both startled by this conclusion.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Jack! You hate women!
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (still surprised over his
dialog: discovery)
dialog: You aren't -- women. I love you.
dialog: Ann, I don't suppose -- you don't
dialog: feel like that about me -- do you?
text: Ann looks at him soberly for a moment, then takes a step
text: nearer.
text: Just as his arms go around her, a hail from the bridge.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN'S VOICE
dialog: Mr. Driscoll! Are you on deck?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
text: (lifts his head long
dialog: enough to reply)
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: (then bends over Ann
dialog: again)
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN'S VOICE
dialog: Please come up here a minute.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (same business)
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'll wait here for you.
text: Driscoll kisses her once more and goes reluctantly.
text: Ann leans back against the bulwarks with a happy smile,
text: looking after him.
text: The Witch Doctor rises noiselessly behind her, and without a
text: sound she is seized and lifted over the rail.
text: THE BRIDGE. NIGHT. Englehorn, Denham, Driscoll - talking over
dialog: chart table.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Now tomorrow morning, pick out the
dialog: men to go ashore. Couple of those
dialog: nervous boys you better leave
text: aboard.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Mr. Denham wants you to break out
dialog: the trade goods the first thing
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: We'll try a little bribery.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Still hoping to make friends with
dialog: that bunch ashore?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Sure. We've got to. I've got to

dialog: He's their tribal legend, their
dialog: god, of course.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: You planning to make movies of a
dialog: fairy story?
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: How do you know Kong's only a
dialog: legend or a fairy story? That wall
dialog: wasn't built for fun.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: But you said yourself it was built
dialog: so long ago the people who live
dialog: here now don't know anything about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Yes, but they've kept it in damn
dialog: good repair. Did you see how those

dialog: to keep something out.
text: Englehorn and Driscoll exchange skeptical looks.
text: Noise of drums increase suddenly.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN

text: down onto the deck.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: What is is, Jack?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Oh -- er -- I was looking for Ann.
dialog: She's gone below, I guess.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: How about turning in, Skipper?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: No, not for me tonight.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: But you've set a watch in the bow.
text: Englehorn shakes his head stubbornly. Driscoll starts to go.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Oh well, I'll sit up with you then.
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Mr. Driscoll, I wish you'd take a
dialog: star sight. See how our position
dialog: checks up with what I got last
dialog: night before we ran into the fog.
text: Driscoll gets out the instruments.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: Yes sir. I guess it's been a long
dialog: time since the map-makers got a

text: DISSOLVE TO Charley, on afterdeck, tying Ignatz and scolding
text: him in Chinese. Ignatz chattering and scolding right back at

speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN

speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: (crosses and looks)
text: Torches going through the village.

speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: My don't know, sir. My not see

speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Guess, she's in her cabin.
text: He goes off. Charley takes a long round deck, sees something
text: near rail. Goes over, picks it up. A native bracelet of woven
text: straw. He examines it for a moment, suddenly realizes what it
text: means, jumps and shouts.
speaker_heading: CHARLEY
dialog: On deck! On deck!
text: He stamps frantically on deck, turns and runs for the bridge.
text: Man on watch in bow runs to rail of fo'c'sle head and shouts.

speaker_heading: DRISCOLL

speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Bos'n!
speaker_heading: BOS'N'S VOICE

speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: Man the boats. Serve out the

speaker_heading: BOS'N'S VOICE
dialog: Yes sir.
text: Bos'n's whistle is heard, creak and thump of davits.
text: Englehorn takes his revolver from chart-table drawer,
text: examines it, puts it in his pocket.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: The boats, Skipper? D'ye think -- ?
speaker_heading: ENGLEHORN
dialog: (significantly)
dialog: They may have stolen something.

scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE - FULL SHOT - DAWN
text: CRANE TO FOLLOW as they come up the ledge. A twittering of

speaker_heading: DENHAM
text: (stops, wipes his
dialog: forehead)
dialog: No telling where he's gone in this

speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: He came by here. Look at those

speaker_heading: DENHAM
text: That's right. He's up ahead

dialog: It's dawn all right.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Look here.
text: He points to one of Kong's great footprints; just visible as
text: a first shaft of dawn light strikes down between the trees.
text: CRANE TO CLOSE. All move forward - TRUCK TO FOLLOW
text: To look at Kong's footprint. Probably no close up necessary.
text: Ad lib murmurs together, "Get that" - "It's tracks" - "Look
dialog: here, Jo."
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Look at the size of that. He must
dialog: be as big as a house. He's come

speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: And he's heading that way. Come on.

speaker_heading: SAILORS
dialog: Look out! Look out!
text: They point and all stop as they see --
text: An immense spike-tailed beast coming through the jungle

speaker_heading: DENHAM

dialog: on.
text: The beast crashes out into the open.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Gimme one of those bombs.
scene_heading: ONE ANGLE ONLY
text: He snatches a bomb from the sailor who is carrying them.
scene_heading: EXT. GLADE - DAWN
text: The beast charges. The men run. Only Driscoll and Denham

text: The first angle at edge of glade, with Denham and Driscoll in
text: the foreground, other men running back.

scene_heading: EXT. GLADE - FULL SHOT - DAWN

speaker_heading: DENHAM
dialog: Wait a minute. He's only knocked
dialog: out.
text: He takes a gun from one of the men and goes forward to the
text: great beast's head. He shoots it through the ear. It's starts
text: convulsing, then grows rigid.
speaker_heading: DENHAM
text: (after a look, speaks to
dialog: Driscoll)
dialog: I told you those gas bombs would
dialog: bring down anything. We'll get that
text: ape alive.
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: We're not trying to catch the ape -
dialog: we're trying to save that girl.

scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - GENERAL VIEW - NIGHT (STOCK)

scene_heading: EXT. 4TH ROOFS - MED. SHOT - DAWN
speaker_heading: POLICE CAPTAIN
dialog: If he takes the girl up there with
dialog: him, we're fair beat.

speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
dialog: Wait a minute. There's one thing we
dialog: haven't tried.
speaker_heading: POLICE CAPTAIN
dialog: And what is that?
speaker_heading: DRISCOLL
text: Air planes. The army planes from

text: bursts into flames.

scene_heading: EXT. 2ND AIRPLANE - MED. SHOT - DAWN

dialog: here's their chance. The military pilot of the second
text: airplane fires machine gun as he dives.
text: (NOTE: A LONG SHOT of Kong in dome from angle of plane would
dialog: it it's possible, help observer get this over. Maybe ZOOM
dialog: SHOT, plane in background)
scene_heading: EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - FULL SHOT - DAWN
text: The airplane whizzes by Kong, firing into him.
scene_heading: EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MED. SHOT - DAWN

dialog: Ann! Ann! Are you all right? Oh, my
dialog: darling, sure you're not hurt?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Ad lib.
