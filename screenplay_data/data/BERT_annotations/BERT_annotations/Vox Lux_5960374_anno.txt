text: Open in a dark hallway. Someone off-camera fusses with the
text: video settings as they walk down a corridor towards a family
dialog: gathering.
text: At the center of everyone’s attention we find a girl at four
text: years old. She wears a set of cowboy boots and a red cowboy
text: hat. She stretches, practices aerobics. Her hair is teased
dialog: and wild.
text: Another young girl who looks nearly identical sits off to the
dialog: side.
text: Despite the verbose nature of the text, a NARRATOR speaks
text: over the image in an unaffected tone.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Celeste was born in America in
dialog: 1986. Considering her parent’s
dialog: background, education, and
dialog: socioeconomic status - being on the
dialog: losing side of “Reaganomics” - the
dialog: name of Latin origin seemed an
dialog: especially poetic choice. It carved
dialog: her out some pre-determined
dialog: destination; a route which to
dialog: travel by.
text: She performs a sort of clumsy square dance in front of where
text: her grandfather and uncle play a duet and sing at a Casio
dialog: keyboard.
speaker_heading: OFF-CAMERA VOICE
dialog: Celeste, look at me. Look at the
dialog: camera.
text: She ignores the request.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: -and many years before CE-LE-STE
dialog: rolled off the cultural tongue like
dialog: a principled anecdote one senses

dialog: not have been described as all that
dialog: special or conspicuously talented,
dialog: however, she did possess that
dialog: proverbial “something” which on
dialog: occasion captured the attention of
text: her teachers and young peers.
dialog: 3.
text: A few other family members cheer her on, laughing and gay,
text: but CELESTE is lost, staring at her feet trying not to trip
text: in her stiff new boots.
speaker_heading: OFF-CAMERA VOICE
dialog: Darling, look at me. Look up.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Despite what naysayers or haters
dialog: later perceived of her ingenuity,
dialog: she was actually a very savvy
dialog: businesswoman. In the beginning,
dialog: she was kind and full of grace, and
dialog: at least she wrote her own lyrics;
dialog: no one could take that away from
dialog: her.
text: The YOUNG GIRL finally acknowledge’s the OFF-CAMERA VOICE.
text: Her eyes are blue and piercing. Her expression is possessed.
speaker_heading: OFF-CAMERA VOICE
dialog: Can you sing us the song you sang

text: She doesn’t reply but her gaze remains locked on the lens.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
text: A BEAT OF SILENCE, THEN...
text: A booming orchestral score chugs, building towards a grand
text: swooning movement...
text: BLACK fades and gives way to a rush of color, shades of

text: The NARRATOR’s voice now fights to be heard over the
text: increasingly cacophonous sound. The shape of the recording

speaker_heading: (to CELESTE and ELEANOR)

speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Yes, the hotel’s very nice.

speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Yes, it’s great. So, what’s next?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: she beat me to the punch.
text: MARKETING PR clears her throat.
speaker_heading: MARKETING PR
dialog: Well, a few things. First, I’ve
dialog: been meaning to ask you if you have

dialog: injury prevents you from...
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I used to take ballet.
speaker_heading: BEAT.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: And no, I just have to be careful.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: MARKETING PR
dialog: That’s great. Internally, we've
dialog: been discussing a few upcoming
dialog: appearances we’d like to pitch you
dialog: for and we’d love to set you up
dialog: with a choreographer.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Okay. What kind of appearances?
speaker_heading: MARKETING PR
dialog: In-store performances, things like
dialog: that. It’s a great way to introduce
dialog: your live experience to the public
dialog: and a great way for you to get your
text: feet wet, in turn.
text: Beat. Something heavy hangs in the air.
speaker_heading: MARKETING PR (CONT'D)
dialog: Celeste, we really love what you do
dialog: here-
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MARKETING PR
dialog: -but after everything you've been
dialog: through, I just think it’s
dialog: necessary to be straight with you
dialog: and let you know that there’s no
dialog: guarantee these new tracks will
dialog: work-
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: hey, hey, hey, she’s 14 years old.
dialog: you don’t need to talk that way to
dialog: the kid. talk to me that way, not
dialog: her.
text: MARKETING PR is very firm with THE MANAGER.
speaker_heading: MARKETING PR
dialog: Let me finish please. (back to
dialog: Celeste) Before we go ahead making
dialog: a lot of plans together, it would
dialog: be unconscionable for me to not
dialog: make a young person like yourself
text: fully cognizant of the reality of

speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Yeah, it’s good, I like it.
text: THE MANAGER is unimpressed, a bit like a petulant kid.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER

speaker_heading: MARKETING PR
dialog: We can change the color. Right

text: CELESTE looks at him.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I like it.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I like it too.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: great, they know what they like.
speaker_heading: MARKETING PR
dialog: (simple)
dialog: That's great, we love it. The
text: lyric inside of the font gives it
dialog: precedence - the sentient of a new
dialog: voice being announced - but the
dialog: most important thing to us is that
dialog: you feel well-represented.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I feel well-represented.

speaker_heading: CHOREOGRAPHER (CONT’D)
dialog: (shouts over music)
dialog: Let’s do it again but this time try

dialog: I guess but I don’t really know
dialog: yet. They haven’t told me but it’s
dialog: a video for a song I made.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: What kind of music do you make?!
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I’m embarrassed to say.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Because I don’t want you to make
dialog: fun of me.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: I’m not going to make fun of you!
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Pop music.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: I love pop music.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: No you don’t!
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: Of course I do. Who doesn’t love
dialog: pop music?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER
text: MUSICIAN leans heavy against CELESTE. She tries to open the
text: door with her key but it doesn’t work.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: Do you have any drugs in the room?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Only pain killers.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I have to go downstairs and get a
dialog: new card. I think I grabbed my
dialog: sister’s key.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: HANDHELD ON -
text: It’s very dark. The faintest moonlight and city lights shine
text: off CELESTE’s skin. Nude, she performs the same choreography
dialog: we saw briefly earlier with her choreographer for the
text: MUSICIAN who cheers her on. The moment is warm and human.
text: She looks softer and more fragile here than previously.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: This is brilliant!
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: You left out a drop and crawl.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (extremely bashful)
dialog: I’m not doing that.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: You do it.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: Fine, I will. Get off my stage.
text: MUSICIAN hops off the bed, also nude, and playfully drops,
text: crawls, and sloppily turns himself upside down.
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: SFX: Shostakovich mournfully underscores the scene.
text: CELESTE lies next to MUSICIAN. The necklace which covers the
text: scar on her throat gives her appearance a sci-fi quality: The
dialog: Woman Who Fell to Earth.
text: MUSICIAN is almost asleep in a dope haze. It gives a casual
text: air to the proceedings.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: You make the same sort of music the
dialog: boy who attacked me used to listen
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: Does that remind you of him?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: It did just this moment.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: I hope that doesn’t upset you too
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: It doesn’t. I think that when you
dialog: meet someone who is going to become
dialog: important to you that it forces us
dialog: to look back at the past so we can
dialog: get on with the future is all.
text: MUSICIAN opens his eyes, thinks.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: In our defense, maybe it was the
dialog: thing that pushed that kid over the
dialog: edge or maybe it was the only thing
dialog: that could have saved him and all
dialog: those other poor kids.
text: CELESTE’s expression darkens.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Anyhow, I’m glad you think I’11l be
dialog: important to you.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I try not to think about it or talk
dialog: about it.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: Why would you? I mean, what is
dialog: there to talk about?
text: CELESTE smiles.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: That's what I love about pop music,
dialog: I think. I don’t want anyone to
dialog: have to think too hard. I just
dialog: want them to feel good.... Put your
text: hand between my legs.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN responds.
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Inside.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Since last January, I have the same
dialog: dream every night.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: In my dream, I am speeding through
text: a tunnel that won’t end.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: You’re in a car?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
text: No, it’s a motorbike - or maybe
dialog: it’s not but I am wearing a helmet
dialog: or something because my view is
text: through some sort of a mask - and
dialog: every time I turn these wide bends
text: in the road, I drive past a body
dialog: but I don’t stop for it.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: A dead body?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: CELESTE
text: Not exactly but, lifeless - after
dialog: some time I realize that they are
dialog: these doubles of me, like clones,
dialog: that I’ve tried to send down the
dialog: tunnel in my place but they've
dialog: never made it to the end. They’re
dialog: not ever the same age and they’re
dialog: always laid out in a different
dialog: configuration.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: That makes sense.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Does it?
text: He wakes up a bit.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: Sure - you almost died so now it’s
dialog: easy to imagine yourself dead at
dialog: any age.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: But in the dream I know that I will
dialog: never die.
text: MUSICIAN pushes into her deeper and makes a crude joke.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
text: What’s at the end of the tunnel.
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I always wake up before I get there
dialog: but I’m so frightened because I’m
dialog: going somewhere where no one can
dialog: find me and no one knows my name.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - EARLY THE NEXT MORNING
dialog: 
text: CELESTE exits an elevator and tiptoes down the hallway. As
text: she comes close to us, we see that tears stream down her
text: face. She looks pretty strung out.
text: CAMERA pans and follows her to the end of the hall.
text: She reaches her sister’s room and slips a key into the door.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: She opens the door and freezes upon the sight of THE MANAGER,
text: naked, sleeping next to ELEANOR.
text: CELESTE stands a long beat looking at them then...
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Guys, wake up.
text: They don’t respond.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, you gotta wake up.
text: ELEANOR suddenly shoots up in bed.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: What are you doing in here?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I had your key. Where’s the
dialog: remote?
text: CELESTE searches the room feverishly for a remote control.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: You gotta turn on the news.
text: ELEANOR is completely out of it. She shouts...
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: GET OUT OF HERE!
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Where’s. the. remote? A plane just
text: crashed into a building in New
dialog: York.
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL - DAY
text: A motorcycle speeds through a tunnel.
dialog: After some time...
speaker_heading: LOUDPSEAKER VOICE
dialog: Now, slow to 40-
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE —
text: A camera crew in a follow car tries to keep a steady pace
text: behind the motorcycle.
dialog: 46.
text: CELESTE clutches a man on a motorcycle and she wears a very
text: distinctive mask.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON -
text: CELESTE’s face. She lip syncs through the open hole for the
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Take me by the hand to where no one
dialog: knows my name.
dialog: Make me feel different tonight or
dialog: make me feel the same (as I used
dialog: to...)
dialog: But when I’m out on stage, it’s all
dialog: for you
dialog: When I can’t make the grade
dialog: I know who’s out there to pull me
dialog: through (through)
dialog: I’m sick and I’m tired of this
dialog: party (party)
dialog: All I can think is you and your
dialog: body (body)
scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL - LATER
text: For a new set-up, CELESTE now has her face revealed to camera
text: while a group of back-up dancers now wearing different
text: variations of the mask from the previous shot lunge towards
text: the center of the lens.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (lip syncs to playback)
dialog: (I keep singing)
dialog: One for the money!
dialog: two for the show!
dialog: on three we get ready and -
dialog: on four we go!
dialog: (I keep hearing)
dialog: One for the money!
dialog: two for the show!
dialog: on three we get ready and -
dialog: on four we go!
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE ON -
text: In profile, we TRACK LEFT with the camera crew and dance
text: troupe as they perform, lunging over and over again at the
text: camera and track set up in front of them. They each take
text: turns vying for the front position.
dialog: 47.
text: From this angle each gesture seems lightly absurd.

speaker_heading: ACT I
scene_heading: EXT. BRAC BEACH RESORT - DAY
scene_heading: ULTRA WIDE PANORAMA ON —
text: Due to the uniform aesthetic of the striped umbrellas it
text: resembles the 1950’s but the beachwear suggests that actually
dialog: some years have passed.
text: After some time, a row of men dressed in masks enter the
text: frame and begin shooting at civilians.
text: It takes a moment for the crowd to react and understand.
text: People begin running for their lives. Most run directly into
text: the sea. Dozens are shot in the back and fall into the
dialog: water.
text: The scene is horrific, brutal.
scene_heading: INT. ATLANTIC CITY HOTEL - MORNING
speaker_heading: STEADICAM ON —
text: THE MANAGER, older now, even more disheveled, walks briskly
text: down the hall of an upscale hotel.
text: A stylist and a few PA’s exit a room and nod at him as they
text: pass. He turns to look at them keeping up his pace.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: where are you going?
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: For a cigarette. She’s with make-
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: is she dressed?
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: Hair wanted her before we start.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: round tables are at 1.
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: That’s not on me. We started 40
text: minutes late.
text: THE MANAGER bites his lip.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: how does she look?
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: Tired.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: A MAKE-UP ARTIST works on CELESTE who looks a bit worse for
text: wear. It’s clear from her matured features that at least 15
text: years have passed. She’s dressed in nude spanks with her hair
text: plastered down for a wig.
speaker_heading: PROFILE ON -
text: CELESTE regards herself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What do you think?
scene_heading: MAKE-UP ARTIST
dialog: You look beautiful. I think it’s
dialog: enough of a statement with the
dialog: brows. I don’t want to keep fussing
dialog: with it too much.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (despondent)
dialog: Okay.
text: CELESTE lights up a cigarette. A knock comes at the door.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come in.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE ON -
text: THE MANAGER enters...
dialog: 49,
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: how‘’s it going in here?
scene_heading: MAKE-UP ARTIST
text: 20 minutes away.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: great. (Beat) celeste, i need to
dialog: speak with you before we start
dialog: today.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: it’s better in private.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Toni doesn’t care. What is it?
text: THE MANAGER gathers himself and speaks.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: there’s a- shooting, they think
dialog: it’s terrorism, in a beach town
dialog: called brac in croatia.
text: CELESTE turns around in her chair.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: We know someone who got hurt?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: no, of course not. don’t worry. i
dialog: guess there’s not really a lot of
dialog: information yet but so far twenty
dialog: people are dead and-
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Hey, we finally got our act
dialog: together; can’t cancel a show every
dialog: time something terrible happens
dialog: somewhere.
text: THE MANAGER opens his mouth to interrupt but fails to get a
dialog: word in.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: No, listen, whatever it is, no one
dialog: is going to think we are
dialog: insensitive for playing a gig
text: halfway around the world.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: it’s not that.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Who did it?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: far as i know, nobody’s claimed
dialog: responsibility yet but let me
dialog: finish.
text: CELESTE braces herself.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: the attackers were all wearing
dialog: masks from our One For the Money
dialog: video.
text: CELESTE furrows her brow.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: these guys all came out in masks
dialog: and started shooting people at a
dialog: beach resort.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: How similar?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: The masks.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: i don’t know, the same ones, i
dialog: guess.
text: THE MANAGER runs his hands through his hair and shakes it
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Okay. (beat) Why?
text: He shrugs.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: that’s as much as I know. you’re
dialog: going to get a lot of questions
dialog: about it today and i want you to be
dialog: prepared.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Fuck me. I can’t believe this is
dialog: happening today.
text: BEAT. CELESTE thinks.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can we call off the press?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: we can - but probably not without
dialog: calling off tonight, as well.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What a mess.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: josie thinks it looks bad to avoid
dialog: it anyway. people are going to be
dialog: on your side. we just need to face
dialog: it head-on and be, ya know, astute
dialog: in our response. we’re making
dialog: arrangements now to hold a press
text: conference downstairs at 4.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: A press conference!? Are you
dialog: kidding me?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: it’ll be 5 minutes. i called josie
dialog: and told her i need her here with
dialog: us to prepare a statement. now.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL/ CASINO / HOTEL LOBBY - LATER
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEADICAM ON —

speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Has anyone heard about Albertine?
dialog: My phone’s dead.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
text: albertine is in the restaurant
dialog: having lunch. i'm walking you to
dialog: see them right now.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Is she mad at me?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: why would she be mad at you? she’s
dialog: excited to be here.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: I pushed roundtables until after
dialog: press assembly so that hopefully
dialog: allows us time for a few more
text: details to pour in.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: do I dare to ask if you’ve heard
dialog: anything else yet?
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Not really. The gist I have so far
dialog: is that it might all be a
dialog: coincidence-
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: A coincidence, how?
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: (exhales )
dialog: I don’t know, they stopped at a
dialog: costume shop and picked up the
dialog: first disguise, or whatever you
dialog: want to call it, that they saw; but
dialog: now the article SRK sent over
dialog: speculates that it’s more likely
dialog: that the group-
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
text: the gunmen.
text: JOSIE nods.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: -are exploiting your image and body
dialog: of work as a symbol of moral
dialog: corruption in the west or something
dialog: lunatic.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: given her history, i think we
dialog: really gotta try and view this as
dialog: an opportunity to address a few
dialog: important issues to celeste.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: In all likelihood, “her history” is
dialog: half the reason they decided to
dialog: target her.
text: Then to CELESTE...
speaker_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST (CONT’D)
dialog: You need to make it clear from the
dialog: outset that you’re not canceling
dialog: the show tonight or any upcoming
dialog: dates because there’s not enough
dialog: information yet to justify
dialog: canceling.
text: CELESTE is totally strung out, distracted by all the
text: commotion from the casino games and slot machines.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Which important issues to me? What
dialog: did you mean?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: gun violence
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: In Brac? Come on, let’s not try and
dialog: see this as an “opportunity,” man.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: don’t be nasty and sarcastic. i’m
dialog: not trying to gloss over what's
dialog: happened, celeste. we’re here to
dialog: protect you from getting hurt by
dialog: this in any way.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Keep it focused on your outpour of
dialog: love and mourning for the victims,
dialog: and victims of violence all over
dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Can I tell these guys to go fuck
dialog: themselves?
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Nobody’d blame you but don’t say
dialog: anything rash. I don’t want to
dialog: leave anyone in that room a way to
dialog: misconstrue what you’re really
dialog: trying to say.
text: They turn a corner.
speaker_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s terrible that you’ve gotten
dialog: dragged into this. Everyone out
dialog: there will feel for you. Just speak
dialog: from the heart.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I feel like I’m gonna throw up.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: You want us to get you something?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: No, it’s just my meds.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: I’m gonna greet everyone and get us
text: set up in the banquet hall. I’1l
dialog: meet you back here in an hour.
text: THE MANAGER’s phone rings. They continue walking to the end
text: of the hall and make a left into the lobby.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: hello.(beat) i know, i didn’t
dialog: forget but tell him I have to call
dialog: them back in the morning, my time.
text: She furiously searches for any sign of ALBERTINE.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Are they in the restaurant?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: i don’t know, let me call them.
dialog: eleanor just said they were
dialog: “downstairs.”
text: CELESTE spots them off-screen.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Why didn’t you guys come up to the

dialog: 55.
text: CAMERA WHIPS to reveal ELEANOR, a woman now, and ALBERTINE,
text: CELESTE’S 13 year-old DAUGHTER...
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Baby, you look so tired. Do you
dialog: want to come up to my room and take
dialog: a nap?
text: CELESTE reaches out to her daughter in a warm embrace.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: No, I’m really hungry.
text: Closer now, ALBERTINE looks strikingly like CELESTE when she
dialog: was younger.
text: ELEANOR interjects...
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: She wouldn’t eat anything I ordered
dialog: for her down here.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (to Albertine)
dialog: I don’t blame you. I had some room
dialog: service upstairs earlier. It’s
dialog: awful.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: It’s not that. There was a lot of
dialog: turbulence. It made me feel sick.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Did you have fun with Aunt Ellie?
text: ELEANOR speaks to THE MANAGER. It’s awkward.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I showed her around our hometown.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: (to Albertine)
dialog: hey, nice seeing you, ladies.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Did you have a good time with
dialog: Grandma and Grandpa?
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: How'd it go?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: The conference.
text: CELESTE seems like she’s almost already forgotten.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Haven't done it yet. Today’s a sick
dialog: kind of joke.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (protective of Albertine)
dialog: I know but let’s not talk about it
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: None of your business. Grown up
dialog: problems. Don’t worry about it.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Do you want to have lunch with me,
dialog: honey?
text: CELESTE looks at ELEANOR and THE MANAGER.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I take Albertine for a quick
dialog: solo girl’s lunch?
text: ELEANOR seems like the decision-maker.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (to Albertine)
dialog: Of course, but I need you back by 4
dialog: so we can get dressed for mom's
dialog: show.
speaker_heading: (to CELESTE)
dialog: We bought outfits for tonight.
text: He says to ELEANOR...
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: she’ll have her back by 3.30.
text: Then to CELESTE...
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
dialog: celeste, can you stick around the
dialog: hotel please? i have to go upstairs
dialog: and meet josie.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I need to get out of this place for
dialog: a bit, clear my head.
text: THE MANAGER looks like he’s about to explode.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: fine. let me call the hotel’s head
dialog: of security and see if they can
dialog: pick you up.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: We don’t need a babysitter. I’m
text: gonna walk Alby across the street
dialog: for some food. Relax.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: across the street? please be back
dialog: before 3:30.
text: CELESTE throws a friendly arm around Albertine and starts
text: walking her away from ELEANOR and THE MANAGER.
text: NOTE: The following is in one uninterrupted sequence shot
dialog: until otherwise noted.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (To ELEANOR) Go take a nap. I/’11
text: bring her back to the room when

text: CELESTE and ALBERTINE walk side-by-side through the lobby.
text: From this angle, they look they could be friends, the same

speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you want to eat?
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (messily)
dialog: What do you mean? Of course you
dialog: know. I hate talking to kids your
dialog: age now and they always say they
dialog: “don’t know” about everything. Are
dialog: you feeling depressed or what?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: No.
text: Some hotel guests seem to recognize CELESTE as she walks by.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I’m only teasing. Don’t listen to
dialog: me. Trying to get you to relax
dialog: around me.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: I am relaxed. I’m just
dialog: uncomfortable because so many
text: people are looking at us.
text: CELESTE hasn’t noticed.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: That’s why I want us to get out of
dialog: here. There’s gonna be cameras
dialog: outside cause everyone knows we’re
dialog: here. You wanna go around the
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: No, I‘’1l just walk ahead of you.
text: ALBERTINE speeds up her pace and puts her head down as she
text: steps through the Hotel’s Front entrance.
text: CELESTE steps outside...
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL / ATLANTIC CITY STRIP - CONTINUOUS
text: A team of photographers stand behind a barrier. CELESTE
text: walks by as quickly as she can.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHERS
dialog: Celeste! Can you take a minute to
dialog: talk with us? Celeste!
text: CELESTE waves as she walks by and continues.
text: We follow her around the bend and she turns around to speak
text: to someone off-screen.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Hey man! Please don’t follow me.
dialog: I’m going to have lunch. I’1l be
dialog: back here in 45 minutes and you can
dialog: take as many pictures as you want.
dialog: Can you leave me alone?
dialog: 59.
text: Suddenly an outburst...
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m serious, man, get away from me.
text: Beat. She looks back again.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank YOU. Jeez.
text: The camera pans up to the stretch of Atlantic City skyline as
text: as we follow CELESTE for the length of the block until she
text: finally catches up with ALBERTINE.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, slow down.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: I hate those people.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Everybody hates those people. Don’t
dialog: think about it. You should have let
dialog: ‘em take your picture back there
dialog: cause you look so beautiful today.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: No, I don’t. I just got off a
dialog: plane. I don’t have any make-up on.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Can I give ya some of mine? I
dialog: looked like a pterodactyl when I
dialog: woke up this morning.
text: ALBERTINE sort of laughs at the joke.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s the thanks you get for
dialog: giving the gift of life. No good
dialog: deed, unpunished. Little babies
dialog: suck the life blood right out of
dialog: ya.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Shut up, you look great, mom.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Thank christ for that. I’m better
dialog: off than some of these other girls
dialog: I meet.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Like who?
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I’m not telling!
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Why, what’s wrong with them?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Nothing really, I just mean when I
dialog: flip through magazines I see all
dialog: these girls I know and half the
dialog: time, I’ve seen them naked in a
dialog: dressing room or whatever so I know
dialog: where they have an ugly birthmark
dialog: or they got a tail cut off.
text: shoots her a look.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Who had a tail?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Don’t look so excited cause I’m not
dialog: telling you. I mean, come on, I
dialog: wouldn’t want anyone spreading that
dialog: kind of personal stuff about me
dialog: around.
text: They arrive at the restaurant and enter but camera stays
text: positioned outside and views much of the rest of the scene
text: through a window...
scene_heading: INT./ EXT.
scene_heading: DINER - AFTERNOON
text: CELESTE and ALBERTINE sit down at an empty cafe table
text: opposite one another.
text: Heavy traffic reflects off the glass in front of us
text: throughout the shot.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: It’s nice to sit with someone who
dialog: doesn’t have their face buried in
dialog: their phone.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Ellie took my phone away.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Well, she was probably right to
dialog: take your phone away. That’s cool,
dialog: you should listen to her.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: If she’s so cool then why do you
dialog: hate having her around?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I don’t hate having her around. I
dialog: just wanted some alone time with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: You act like you hate her.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Don’t say ugly things like that.
dialog: That’s not true.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: I’m not saying that you actually
dialog: hate her, I’m just saying you act
dialog: like it.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Well, sometimes I’ve got a short
dialog: fuse, you know, cause I don’t sleep
dialog: a lot and I’ve got a lot of stuff
dialog: on my plate. There’s no money in
dialog: music anymore. It’s all branded
dialog: content and Virtual Reality. I do
text: voices for a video game character
dialog: now for Christ’s sake, and I make
dialog: more money in an afternoon than all
dialog: year on tour.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Then why do you leave us and go on
dialog: tour for so long?
text: CELESTE blows a gasket but tries to keep a lid on it.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: It’s a lot more complicated than
dialog: that. If I don’t keep up with the
dialog: times, the times leave without me,
dialog: you know, and I got a lot of people
dialog: to pay. More people than you can
dialog: imagine. It’s a full-time job. It’s
dialog: like I’m connected to the whole
dialog: world all the time. I can hear
dialog: everyone in my head.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: I thought we were talking about
dialog: Aunt Ellie.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What do you want to talk about? Is
dialog: she okay?
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: She’s upset you don’t ever try and
dialog: see her.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: She told you this? That really
dialog: pisses me off that she’s bringing
dialog: our problems into my relationship
dialog: with you cause that has nothing to
dialog: do with you. You got that?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: What problems do you have with her?
dialog: You have everything she ever
dialog: wanted.
text: CELESTE throws her hands up.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: That’s ridiculous.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: I’m serious. When we visited
dialog: Grandpa he even showed us this
dialog: video of her singing when you guys
dialog: were little and he kept calling her
dialog: Celeste. He was joking about it but
dialog: I could tell it just made her feel
dialog: bad.
text: CELESTE’s energy turns increasingly manic.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Hey, what can I say, your aunt has
dialog: too many scruples and sometimes
dialog: life just isn’t that fair.
dialog: Especially not nowadays.
text: CELESTE tries to come at her point from a different angle.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: People now will try and sell yaa
dialog: TV monitor that plain as day looks
dialog: like shit, but they call it
dialog: “ultra,” “mega,” “triple hi-def,”
dialog: whatever, and their business model
dialog: relies on their customer's
dialog: unshakable stupidity.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Deep down maybe we probably all
dialog: sense this - their intimate
dialog: knowledge of our commitment to the
dialog: lowest common denominator - but we
dialog: go along with it anyway.
text: CELESTE laughs.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Okay-
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I mean, I’m pretty sure that every
dialog: year my videos look worse and worse
dialog: but they're doing better and
dialog: better. For example, they showed me
dialog: this perfume thing we shot last
dialog: year where I’m unfurling from a
dialog: digital rose petal like Thumbelina
dialog: and I thought it would ruin me! But
dialog: here I am opening for 70,000.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Mom, what are you even talking
dialog: about-
text: CELESTE lays down the law.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I’m letting you in on a secret
dialog: cause I love you, that’s what. It
dialog: doesn’t matter anymore if you're
dialog: Michelangelo or Michael & Angelo
dialog: from Ridgewood, you just need an
dialog: angle. And Aunt Ellie never found
text: an angle. She had her head in the
dialog: clouds and then she decided to be
dialog: jealous of my good fortune. She
dialog: made her own choices and let me
dialog: tell you, she could never do what I
dialog: do, day in and day out. Luckily,
dialog: she gets to go home to you every
dialog: night and she doesn’t have any real
dialog: life responsibilities because I
dialog: finance her entire life.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Be quiet.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Don’t tell me to be quiet.
text: ALBERTINE rolls her eyes.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: No, shh, I don’t mean it like
dialog: that... Isn’t that your song?
text: They stop and listen.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I’m sorry. Let me go ask them to
dialog: turn it off.
text: CELESTE stands and walks over to the bar. Camera pans with
dialog: her...
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, can you turn that off please?
dialog: We’re about to order some lunch and
dialog: I'm trying to talk with my kid but
text: all I can hear is my voice inside
dialog: of my head.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Yeah, sorry, my manager told me to
dialog: put it on.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: It’s fine, listen, can you send me
text: over a drink and maybe a soda for
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What would you like?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I don’t know, a glass of white wine
dialog: or something, whatever you have
dialog: that isn’t gross. And can you put
dialog: it in a plastic cup or something?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Sure.
dialog: NOTE: End of sequence shot.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE ON -
text: CAMERA inside the restaurant; CELESTE walks into CLOSE-UP and
text: sits down.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Hey, I’m sorry to rag so much on
dialog: Ellie. I know she’s doing her best.
dialog: I’m having a shit day and I’m
text: taking it out on her.
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Better her than me.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I never take it out on you.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I don’t, do I?
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, if I do, I don’t mean to.
text: CELESTE suddenly has tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sometimes when you think it can’t
dialog: get any worse, you get diagnosed
dialog: with some freakin’ disease, you
dialog: know what I mean?
text: ALBERTINE shifts in her chair.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Are you sick, mom?
text: CELESTE wipes her face.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: No, I don’t mean literally, I just
dialog: mean sometimes you get kicked when
dialog: you're down.
text: CELESTE can’t stop crying.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t do this in
dialog: front of you.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: It’s fine.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (forces a smile)
dialog: No, it’s not. I'd slap me in the
dialog: face if I was sitting across from
dialog: me right now.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Really, it’s fine.
dialog: 66.
text: CELESTE exhales and dramatically delivers.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Dan left me.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: I know. I read about it.
text: CELESTE furrows her brow.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: You read about it?! Aunt Ellie’s
dialog: not supposed to let you read all
dialog: that gossip shit.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: She can’t control everything I do
text: like a watchdog.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Yeah, but I just wanted to be the
dialog: one to tell you. I feel like big
text: moments keep getting stolen away
dialog: from me.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Mom. It’s fine. I don’t care. I
dialog: don’t care about that guy.
text: CELESTE looks shocked.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I thought you loved Dan.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: He was fine. I was just nice to
dialog: him because he was nice to you.
text: A SERVER enters with CELESTE and ALBERTINE’s drinks.
speaker_heading: SERVER
dialog: Here you are. Have you decided on
dialog: something to eat?
text: CELESTE tries not to look up and let him see she’s crying.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I think we need another second with
dialog: the menu. Thanks.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: I just want the pasta with
text: marinara.
speaker_heading: SERVER
dialog: You want me to put that in now or
dialog: want me to wait?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: It’s fine, I don’t need anything.
dialog: Just bring her some pasta.
text: The server walks away.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Why did he leave you?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Who said he left me?
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: You did.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Well, he didn’t. We left each other
dialog: because if you love something you
dialog: give it away.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Was he seeing someone else?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Is that what you read?
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Yeah, it said he started dating
dialog: some rich girl.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I don’t know. If he is, he didn’t
dialog: tell me about it. I’m sure it’s
dialog: just a fling. I’ve had flings too
dialog: that I don’t want anyone to define
dialog: my character by.
text: The RESTAURANT MANAGER suddenly interrupts the flow of
dialog: conversation.
text: CELESTE keeps her face down.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: Drinks okay?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Yes, thank you.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: I’m the manager here so let me know
dialog: personally if you need anything.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Will do, thanks.
text: BEAT. He doesn’t go away.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: You mind if I get a quick picture
dialog: with you?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I’m sorry but now’s not a great
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: It’s not for public use or
dialog: anything. Just for me. It will only
dialog: take a minute.
text: CELESTE finally looks up at him defiantly revealing the
text: smeared make-up from her tears.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Is this really what you want a
dialog: picture with? I’m trying to talk
dialog: with my daughter.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: I’m sorry but you really don’t have
dialog: to use that tone with me. I think I
dialog: asked you very nicely.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Let’s just go.
text: Without warning, CELESTE suddenly slams her hands on the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: Alright, m’am. I was trying to be
dialog: friendly with you but now I’m going
dialog: to have to ask you to leave the
dialog: restaurant.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Are you fucking serious, man?
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: Please don’t use that language with
dialog: me.
dialog: 69.
text: CELESTE stands and gets in his face.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: How dare you, motherfucker.
text: The RESTAURANT MANAGER calls over to the SERVER.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: Ally, can you call the cops please.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Who the fuck do you think you are.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: I was about to ask you the same
dialog: thing. I can smell that you have
dialog: alcohol on your breath, miss, so I
dialog: won't take this personally.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Are you trying to embarrass me in
dialog: front of my daughter.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: I didn’t even know you had a
dialog: daughter. I just came over to be
dialog: friendly and then you started
dialog: shouting at me and now I’m telling
dialog: you to leave my restaurant or I’m
text: calling the cops.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Please, let’s go!
text: CELESTE considers her options and then turns exits the
text: restaurant with ALBERTINE.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (on the way out)
dialog: You should be ashamed of yourself,
dialog: prick.
text: The door shuts.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER
dialog: No, you should be ashamed, miss.
text: The RESTAURANT MANAGER turns to his staff members.
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT MANAGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Can you believe that crazy bitch?
dialog: Mike, did you get that on camera?
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: EXT. ATLANTIC CITY STRIP - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: SFX: Richard Wagner’s Rienzi Cverture underscores the scene.
text: It violently fights the wind, conversation, and traffic
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: STEADICAM ON —
text: We follow CELESTE who has her arms wrapped ALBERTINE’s
dialog: shoulders.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Let’s make a right here and go
dialog: around the back so we don’t have to
dialog: deal with all those shitheads out
dialog: front.
text: They turn right and walk... Beat.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m really sorry I lost my cool
dialog: with that guy.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: He was asking for it but I don’t
dialog: want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: You seem shook up. That kind of
dialog: thing doesn’t happen all the time,
dialog: you know, but sometimes it does and
dialog: I gotta protect myself.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: I said I don’t want to talk about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: But baby, we gotta talk about it,
dialog: otherwise, it’s just gonna hang in
dialog: the air. Why don’t you want to talk
dialog: to me?
text: ALBERTINE sulks.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: You got tears in your eyes. Come
dialog: on, what is it?
text: ALBERTINE’s voice cracks with heartbreak but they never stop
dialog: walking.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: (shattered)
dialog: I’m worried about you!
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Worried about me?! Come on, you
dialog: don’t need to worry about ME. I’m
dialog: solid. I worry about YOU. That’s
dialog: my job, to worry about you.
text: shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: You’re skinnier than I am.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: That’s cause I’m in great shape
dialog: from going out and dancing my ass
dialog: off every night.
text: CELESTE squeezes her close. ALBERTINE wipes some tears off
text: her face.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, baby. You’re breaking my
dialog: heart. Listen up, what that guy
dialog: said about me having alcohol on my
dialog: breath; that was a terrible thing
dialog: to imply in front of you and
dialog: instead of just ignoring the
dialog: elephant in the room, we need to
dialog: talk about it, head-on.
text: CELESTE finds the words...
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I ordered a glass of wine from them
dialog: in a plastic cup cause I needed to
dialog: let go of some tension I’m having
dialog: about tonight and I didn’t want you
dialog: to think there was anything to
dialog: worry about. I swear on your life I
dialog: wasn’t drinking before that today.
dialog: You don’t need to worry about stuff
dialog: like that, okay?
text: The girls continue their walk and talk down the boulevard as
text: diegetic sound fades out and the NARRATOR takes over.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (0.S.)
dialog: In 2011, Celeste had drunk herself
dialog: blind, or more precisely, blind in
text: one eye, but had waited to tell a
dialog: physician about the trouble she’d
dialog: been having, too embarrassed to
dialog: explain that while touring the less
dialog: inhabited, and therefore less
dialog: inhibited, parts of the southern
dialog: United States, she had managed to
text: damage the optic nerve in her left
dialog: eye by ingesting various forms of
text: methanol during a stint of binge
dialog: drinking household cleaning
text: products across three state lines.
dialog: Shortly thereafter, when back at
dialog: home, she found herself at the
dialog: center of a very public dispute
text: over a traffic collision and one
text: pedestrian’s crushed left leg and
dialog: pelvis.
text: The girls continue to walk and comfort each other.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT’D)
dialog: The victim of this short-lived
dialog: episode in her life saw an
dialog: opportunity and seized it. That
dialog: golden ticket came in the form of a
dialog: nearly seventeen million dollar
dialog: settlement which was to remain for
dialog: all intents and purposes, under the
text: table. All just another flame in
dialog: the crowd of what Celeste perceived
dialog: a decade-long witch hunt. Whatever
dialog: it was, Celeste needed something
dialog: big to pull her out of this mess, a
dialog: show that could put Ellie,
text: Albertine, and herself back on
dialog: track.
text: ALBERTINE looks like she’s starting to let CELESTE cheer her
dialog: up.
text: Diegtic sound resumes for a moment...
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: What is it? You got something else
dialog: on your mind?
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: It’s nothing.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Stop it. What is it?
text: Diegtic sound fades out and the narrator resumes...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Albertine had lost her virginity
dialog: the weekend prior to leaving for
dialog: this first unveiling of Celeste’s
dialog: 6th studio recording, Vox Lux, in
dialog: Atlantic City, and yearned to share
text: the galvanizing details with her
dialog: mother. She had made herself sick
dialog: with anticipation every day since
dialog: and looked forward to the initial
dialog: shock or sense of failure it might
dialog: inspire in Celeste whom, albeit, no
dialog: stranger to crimes of passion in
dialog: her youth, had always spoken
dialog: severely of young men; even warning
dialog: of them more than mixing uppers
dialog: with downers, for example.
text: The girls turn a corner into the backlot of the hotel where
text: security stands already anticipating CELESTE’s re-entrance.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT’D)
dialog: If all went according to plan, the
dialog: news might just strike up a long-
dialog: misplaced maternal instinct and
dialog: Celeste would be forced to act as
dialog: her confidant.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER
text: ELEANOR answers the door to CELESTE.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: That was a fast-
text: ELEANOR sees that ALBERTINE isn’t with CELESTE.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Where’s Albertine?
text: CELESTE pushes past ELEANOR into the room.
scene_heading: INT. ELEANOR’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: CELESTE paces circles around ELEANOR. She occasionally slurs
text: and stutters through her rant.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I have her upstairs in my room
dialog: taking a pregnancy test cause
dialog: apparently you’re so fucking
dialog: incompetent that you let my
dialog: daughter get fucked by some hick
dialog: from town.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: She’s pregnant?
text: CELESTE throws her hands up.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Unless she’s as unlucky as me then
dialog: probably not but I want her to feel
dialog: the unease of waiting for the
dialog: results to come in because a
dialog: parent, or legal guardian,
dialog: disciplines the kid, doesn’t just
dialog: hang out with them.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I’m sorry. I had no idea.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: You fucked up.
text: CELESTE holds up two fingers.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Twice.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I know you’re mad but-
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: How could I be so stupid?! If you
dialog: did so badly with me how could I
dialog: ever expect you to do right by her.
text: ELEANOR stammers...
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I knew she was seeing a guy but it
dialog: didn’t seem physical, I swear.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Are you a retard?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Ya know, Ellie, sometimes your jaw
dialog: slacks in this certain way like
dialog: your life is just happening to you
dialog: and you just look like a retard.
text: ELEANOR blinks, not sure how to respond. Tears stream down
text: her face.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Don’t say that about me.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Only crazy people get aggravated
dialog: when you call them crazy so you
dialog: must really be retarded.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: After everything I’ve done for you,
dialog: how can you hate me so much?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Is that the kind of garbage you've
dialog: been filling her head with? She
dialog: told me all the shit you’ve been
text: putting on her shoulders.
text: CELESTE uses two fingers to press the middle of ELEANOR’s
dialog: skull.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: You have that hapless look like
dialog: dad.
text: ELEANOR sits down in a chair and sobs.
text: HOLD ON THIS...
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a press conference then two
dialog: hours of round tables but I swear
dialog: to God, Ellie, if my daughter comes
dialog: back to me with that cross-eyed
dialog: Guido’s kitten litter or Hepatitis
dialog: Z, I'll throw you off that balcony.
text: ELEANOR wipes the tears from her face.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: If you threaten me ever again, I'll
dialog: tell everyone I write your songs.
text: CELESTE chews her jaw.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Today I’d say that’s a stock you
dialog: don't want to buy into.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM / MAKE-UP - LATER
text: A team of make- and hairstylists reset CELESTE’s face.
text: The STYLIST walks over with a new blouse for her to change
dialog: into...
speaker_heading: STYLIST
dialog: Here you go, dear. That’s better.
text: THE MANAGER hovers around her, checking her out.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: you look amazing. keep it simple.
dialog: you’re gonna do great.
text: He squeezes her shoulders.
scene_heading: INT. PRESS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON -
text: CELESTE is on-stage in front of a packed press room.
text: Flashbulbs are blinding.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: First I’d like to say that I have..
text: an outpour of love for victims of
dialog: this tragedy and victims of
dialog: violence all over the world and I
dialog: am deeply saddened to be associated
dialog: with such an obscene and
dialog: unnecessary tragedy... It’s a weird
dialog: time we live in, and I guess, no
dialog: matter how much we try and ignore
dialog: these things that are really
dialog: happening around us, they always
dialog: find a way to creep in.
speaker_heading: PRESS 1 (0.S.)
dialog: Jennifer Durst, WYNN NY, why do you
dialog: think they targeted you? Do you
dialog: assume there’s a connection to
dialog: Ridgewood?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: No idea. I pretty much know as much
dialog: as you so far, and since nobody's
dialog: coming out and saying “we did this”
dialog: yet, I'd really prefer not to
dialog: speculate too much - but if they
dialog: did pick that “disguise” on purpose
dialog: I guess it’s cause they don’t like
dialog: that I’m a woman or that I’ma
dialog: successful woman. Maybe they don’t
dialog: like that I had a kid when I was a
dialog: kid. Maybe they think I’m a floozy.
dialog: But I guess some of you think that
dialog: too.
text: CELESTE shrugs and smiles.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: The way I have chosen to live my
dialog: life goes against some people’s
dialog: views about things.
speaker_heading: PRESS 1 (0.S.)
dialog: Are there any links between you and
dialog: central Europe?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I mean, not really. Not that I
dialog: know of. I’ve never played there so
dialog: I really don’t know.
text: MODERATOR chimes in.
speaker_heading: MODERATOR (0.S.)
dialog: Next question... There, at the
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: PRESS 1
dialog: Sorry, I just have one more. Are
dialog: you and the band still going
dialog: forward with the show tonight?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: There’s really not enough
dialog: information yet for us to justify
dialog: canceling and my dad always says,
dialog: “never postpone joy,” so yeah, I'll
dialog: play if they let me.
text: CELESTE smiles and shrugs.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: PRESS 2 (0.S.)
dialog: Afternoon, Meredith Desh, Atlantic
dialog: City, Greater NorthEast, do you
dialog: have anything you wish to
dialog: communicate to the perpetrators of
dialog: today’s attack?
text: There’s a LONG BEAT...
text: Hold on CELESTE. Bulbs flash over and over again.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (especially nonchalant)
dialog: Yeah, I’d like to tell them that
dialog: when I was a little girl I used to
dialog: believe in God too...
text: The statement hangs in the air.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: -and if they ever come to their
dialog: senses and they'd like something
dialog: new to believe in, they can start
dialog: believing in me cause I’m the new
dialog: faith and I’m not afraid of them.
dialog: Hell, I’d even like to extend an
dialog: invite to my show tonight. I’1l be
dialog: sure to put “cowards in masks” on
dialog: the guest list.
speaker_heading: PRESS 2
dialog: I’m sorry but can you clarify what
dialog: you mean exactly?
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON -
text: JOSIE and THE MANAGER bury their faces in their hands as arms
dialog: shoot up for further questioning.
speaker_heading: BACK TO -
speaker_heading: CELESTE.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I don’t know. I’m just making a
dialog: quip.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR / HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: CELESTE and her team are packed into an elevator.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: are you out of your fucking mind?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I don’t want to talk about it.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: we coached you on what to say and
dialog: you said... the opposite. why the
dialog: fuck would you start spewing all
dialog: that weird shit out of your mouth?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: You give it a try sometime. I was
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: i’m pretty certain if i follow, and
dialog: correct me if i’m wrong, you
dialog: compared yourself to some sort of a
dialog: demigod and invited a group of
dialog: terrorists to your fucking concert
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Don’t give them so much credit,
dialog: anyway, it was a joke.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: not exactly how I think our
dialog: sponsors are going to see it. do
dialog: you actually believe that weird
dialog: shit you said up there?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: They wanted a show, I gave ‘ema
dialog: show.
text: They arrive at their floor and step out.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Alright, this place is swarming
dialog: with press. Can I kindly ask you
dialog: both to keep your mouths shut until
dialog: we are finished?
text: CELESTE winks at JOSIE.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Fine by me.
text: JOSIE says to THE MANAGER.
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Let me handle it. Go smoke a
dialog: cigarette or something.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM / ROUND TABLES - LATER
dialog: 
text: JOSIE enters with CELESTE and tells the group...
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (tongue in cheek)
dialog: hello everybody.
text: CELESTE seems even more strung out than before.
text: She sits down in front of four journalists and various
text: recording devices set up in front of her chair.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: You have ten minutes, and as we
dialog: currently have no more information
dialog: regarding what’s happening across
dialog: the Atlantic right now, I’d kindly
dialog: like to ask everyone to keep the
dialog: questions to tonight’s performance
dialog: and the new album now as much as
dialog: possible.
text: JOSIE turns and exits.
text: One journalist leads the charge.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Well, on that note then, can you
dialog: tell us what audiences can expect
dialog: from the new album?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Sci-fi anthems. The concept with
dialog: this one was to create an
dialog: experience as relentless and
dialog: addictive as possible.
text: A second JOURNALIST joins in...
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 2
dialog: I know we’ve just been asked to not
dialog: talk about today’s attack but I
dialog: guess I can’t help but let it
dialog: contextualize my next question.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Okay...
dialog: 81.
text: CELESTE bites her lip.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 2
dialog: It just got me thinking, do you
dialog: feel that there’s been a shift in
dialog: the culture where nihilist radical
dialog: groups like this are increasingly
dialog: keen on being perceived as
dialog: superstars themselves?
text: CELESTE is suddenly lucid and precise in her language.
dialog: The group
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I mean, who cares? I was hesitant
dialog: to even give a statement today
dialog: because all these ultra-violent
dialog: thugs want is to make headlines. If
dialog: everyone paid them no attention,
dialog: they'd cease to exist - and so
dialog: would people like me. That’s the
dialog: only link I see between them and
dialog: superstars.
text: looks a little baffled by her digression.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: -but I couldn’t just ignore the
dialog: casualties, ya know. Makes me sick.
text: JOURNALIST 2 writes down her statement.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST 2
dialog: Thanks for your answer, appreciate
dialog: your candidness.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: From the public’s perspective, this
dialog: has been an-
text: The JOURNALIST chooses his words.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST (CONT’D)
dialog: -emotional few years for you,
dialog: bizarre events today very much
dialog: included. Can you shed light on the
dialog: significance of these upcoming
dialog: arena performances for you
dialog: personally?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: This is the culmination of my
dialog: life’s work so far. You know, we
dialog: worked on it for two years before
dialog: bringing it to the public.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Why two years?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Year before that I was under a lot
dialog: of stress after my accident-
text: CELESTE smiles a bashful grin.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: -and it’s an expensive event to put
dialog: on, and we also waited on all the
dialog: best people to become available to
dialog: help us make it happen. I wanted
dialog: all my best dancers back.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: So, you consider these events a
dialog: resurgence since the accident and
dialog: arrest for “causing serious injury
dialog: by dangerous driving?”
text: CELESTE blinks.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Injury, not serious injury. I never
dialog: stopped making music so I don’t
dialog: consider it a “resurgence.” I just
dialog: wanted to channel all that anxiety
dialog: and suffering into something
text: tangible, something positive.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Can you shed any light on why the
dialog: case was abruptly dropped-
scene_heading: LONG BEAT.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I see what you’re doing.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: You brought it up.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Don’t try and have me say
text: “abruptly” anything.
text: CELESTE laughs and lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: There are three classifications of
text: gunshot wounds to the spine.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m type three which is when the
text: bullet is actually inside the
text: intervertebral disc space. Now,
dialog: type three injuries are subdivided
dialog: into (A) spinal lesion not
dialog: associated with perforation of
dialog: abdominal viscera or (B) injury
dialog: with perforation of abdominal
dialog: organs. Thankfully, I’m type A.,
dialog: but it’s no secret to anybody that
dialog: I take meds for my injury and that
dialog: I never shoulda been behind the
text: wheel of a car that night.
text: CELESTE exhales and calls out for JOSIE.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Josie!
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: I didn’t mean to upset you.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: People used to talk about me like I
dialog: was a hero and then all the sudden,
dialog: I was lower than trailer trash.
dialog: That’s what this show’s about; a
dialog: rebirth.
text: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST enters the room to stop the interview.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Time’s up.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: Have you been at all in contact
dialog: with the victim, Mr. Joel Hedlund?
text: CELESTE furrows her brow, suspicious.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Okay, that’s enough.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I said I can’t talk about it.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: I thought we were talking about it
dialog: just now.
text: JOSIE grabs CELESTE.
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Does it not seem like an
dialog: insensitive time to be bringing
dialog: this up? I’ve had it. You and I are
dialog: through, Tommy. I’m sick of this
dialog: kinda shit from you.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: I'm doing my job, Josie.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: This guy’s trying to kick me while
dialog: I’m down.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Celeste, stop, this is over.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST
dialog: That’s not what I’m trying to do.
dialog: I’m sorry you've misunderstood.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Why don’t you go and write about
dialog: what happened to those innocent
dialog: people today instead of trying to
dialog: tear me down.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
scene_heading: STEAICAM ON -
text: We follow JOSIE and CELESTE as they walk briskly down the
text: hall towards the stairwell. They pass several journalists
text: sitting in folding chairs who are patiently waiting their
text: turn for 10 minutes with CELESTE.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: I’m standing everything down until
dialog: after the show. I want you to go to
dialog: your room and get some rest. SOME
dialog: REST, okay? I’m serious. I’1l come
dialog: get you at 6.30. What floor are you
dialog: on?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
text: One floor up. 1823.
scene_heading: INT. CELESTE’S SUITE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: CELESTE enters to find THE MANAGER and ALBERTINE posed
text: against her suite’s beachfront view in the middle of an
dialog: embrace.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Get your hands off her.
text: THE MANAGER squints his brow and lifts his hands from
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: i came in here and she was crying
dialog: by herself. she needed a hug.
text: CELESTE speaks only to ALBERTINE.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Go downstairs and get ready for the
dialog: show.
text: ALBERTINE starts to rush past CELESTE but CELESTE catches
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, don’t do that.
text: She whispers...
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope you didn’t take that thing I
dialog: gave you. I over-reacted.
text: ALBERTINE doesn’t respond.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: What? You want me to shout it from
dialog: the rooftops?
text: She pinches her daughter's side.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m just not ready for you to grow
dialog: up is all. You’re my little girl.
dialog: Forgive me?
text: ALBERTINE sort of smiles and nods her head.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on a minute.
text: CELESTE grabs a bouquet of flowers from a vase in her room
text: and sets them next to some hotel stationary where she jots
text: down a crudely written “I’m sorry I was a bitch” and sets
text: it on a rose.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Give these to Ellie.
dialog: 86.
text: She shoves the bouquet at ALBERTINE.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: What’s this for?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: For everything. Take them down and
dialog: I‘1l meet you guys in the lobby.
dialog: We'll head over together. I love
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: Yeah, me too.
text: ALBERTINE kisses her mom and exits...
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER (0.S.)
dialog: why aren't you with Josie?
text: CELESTE is almost startled.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Jesus. I almost forgot you were
text: standing there.
text: CAMERA pans over to THE MANAGER.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Josie called off the rest of the
dialog: day. Some guy was coming after me
dialog: about Joel Hedlund and I just
dialog: didn’t have the mental capacity or
text: balls to take him on.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: christ. i'll go talk her off her a
dialog: ledge.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: No. Stay with me.
text: CELESTE sits down with her legs spread across from THE
speaker_heading: MANAGER.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: You got any stuff left from last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: you think that’s a good idea right
dialog: now?
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (frank, matter-of-fact)
dialog: I’m done yammering for the day.
text: THE MANAGER raises his eyebrows.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: What? Tonight’s second nature. I
dialog: gotta get out of my head, you know
dialog: that. I’m getting myself all worked
dialog: up from over-thinking everything. I
dialog: keep picturing all those people
text: screaming and running all over the
dialog: sand.
text: THE MANAGER exhales, unsure.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, let’s just take what you
dialog: have left. We won’t call for more
dialog: until after the show and you can
dialog: fuck me for a little while we’re
dialog: high.
text: CELESTE comically holds her hand up for a high five. THE
text: MANAGER laughs, give her a high-five, then holds onto her
text: hand. In a way, they really love each other.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - LATER
text: THE MANAGER exits holding the door open for CELESTE who is in
text: some fancy new wardrobe but looks obliterated.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: Come on, everyone’s downstairs.
text: CELESTE trips out of the door, falls straight on her face.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: You alright?
scene_heading: INT. VAN - EVENING
text: CELESTE seems almost dead in the backseat. ELEANOR,

text: Suddenly, CELESTE pops up to exclaim...
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Stop the car!
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: We’re running late.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Just pull over for 2 minutes.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST

speaker_heading: CELESTE

dialog: Get down with me.
text: ALBERTINE is concerned.
speaker_heading: ALBERTINE
dialog: What are you doing
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Let’s just have a moment of silence
dialog: together.
text: ALBERTINE cautiously kneels down.
speaker_heading: CELESTE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s shut our eyes and hold
dialog: everyone who's suffering right now
dialog: in our hearts.
text: ALBERTINE shuts her eyes...

speaker_heading: PA
dialog: Can I help you Ms. Montgomery?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: No one calls me that.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Give her some space. Are there
dialog: cameras back there?
speaker_heading: PA
dialog: Not that I know of.
scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Tell your team if anyone is caught
text: taking a picture of her, they’re

speaker_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: PA
dialog: Oh, sure, like what?
text: JOSIE, ELEANOR, and THE MANAGER are nearly dragging her into

scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST
dialog: Something with sugar.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Where’s Albertine?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: She's behind you.
speaker_heading: CELESTE

speaker_heading: ALBERTINE

scene_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST

speaker_heading: JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST (CONT’D)
dialog: I need you to call this RIGHT NOW
dialog: if she can’t go on.
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER

dialog: Don’t call me brat!
text: ELEANOR says to JOSIE.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Get her out of here.
text: Then to ALBERTINE. CELESTE shouts and rants behind her.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: (belligerent shouting)
dialog: I'm sick of everyone talking about
dialog: me like I’m not a person! I’m not
dialog: just a thing you can put on and
dialog: wear!
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Baby, your mom needs me right now
dialog: and I need you to go with Josie.

speaker_heading: ALBERTINE

speaker_heading: THE MANAGER

speaker_heading: THE MANAGER (CONT’D)
dialog: i’m sick and i’m tired of you

dialog: brat, and i don’t sit around
text: whining about it.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR

text: Then back to Celeste, he says...
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER (CONT'D)
dialog: you're in a hole, isn’t that right,
dialog: cel?
text: CELESTE has ceased to make much sense.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: You can’t just press a button and
dialog: take out your dishes!
speaker_heading: THE MANAGER
dialog: okay, i think you’re really scaring
dialog: everyone so you gotta just shut
dialog: your eyes and pretend you’re the
dialog: only one in the room. can you do
dialog: that for me?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I said get out.
text: THE MANAGER doesn’t budge.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want me to call this off?
text: He exhales, kisses CELESTE on the forehead and exits.
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Everyone is talking about me like
dialog: I’m not a person right in front of
dialog: them! They’re right in front of me
dialog: when they do it!
text: ELEANOR holds CELESTE to her chest. CELESTE is an outright
text: mess, sobbing and dazed.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: He’s a car salesman. Forget about
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: Ellie, they showed me these promos
dialog: we shot and I looked so bad.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: No, don’t look at me like that,
dialog: listen to me. They shot me with
dialog: this new camera everyone told me is
dialog: great but I looked so ugly. It made
dialog: me want to die, Ellie.
text: ELEANOR seems possessed.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: You're not gonna die.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: I just want to be queen for them
dialog: and sometimes I don’t feel like a
dialog: queen at all, ya know? I’m so ugly
dialog: underneath all this and if they
dialog: only knew-
text: CELESTE cries with her eyes rolled back in her skull.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I’m so grateful you're alive and
dialog: I'm here and I’m not going
dialog: anywhere. Ever.
text: CELESTE has her face buried in her sister’s neck.
speaker_heading: CELESTE
dialog: But the journalists can be so mean,
dialog: Ellie.
text: They begin breathing in unison.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: That’s because they’ve never made
dialog: anything they’re proud of, honey.
dialog: You’re not here for them. You’re
dialog: here for your fans. Tonight will be
dialog: the greatest night of their lives
dialog: and the public will be at your feet
