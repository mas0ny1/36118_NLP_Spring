scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT
text: Underwater.
text: Shafts of eroded light slice into the depths of the Hudson
text: River. The ghostly melody of "Lili Marlene," the ache of the
text: war-time lover, plays as a strange SHADOW drifts into view.
dialog: We realize it is a BODY.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: Some things, once you've loved
dialog: them, become yours forever.
text: The body BREAKS the surface and we see the face of its owner
text: ---- DAVID KAMMERER, 33, bearded, handsome. He is clothed, open
text: white shirt, khakis. Dead.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: And if you try to let them go...
text: Suddenly, a breath: he comes back to life.
text: David floats back to LUCIEN CARR, 20, (blonde, beautiful,
text: shirtless and terrified), waist deep in the water.
text: The scene is playing in REVERSE MOTION.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
text: They only circle back and return to
dialog: you.
text: David's body LIFTS into the young man's arms. We see David's
text: feet and hands are TIED together with shoelaces. Stones rise
text: back into his pockets.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: They become part of who you are...
text: A stain of blood on David's chest shrinks, vanishes.
text: David's eyes OPEN.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE TOMBS - DAY
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: ...or they destroy you.
text: From behind the bars of a jail cell, Lucien Carr (the young
text: man from the opening) finishes reading from a paper
text: MANUSCRIPT in his hand.
dialog: 2.
text: Lucien, furious, crumples it up.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You can't show this to anyone.
text: We PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: a
text: eighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. But
dialog: determined.
text: Allen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of the
dialog: bars.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Then tell the truth, Lu.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You weren't even there. It's your
dialog: truth. It's fiction.
text: Allen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it out
dialog: of reach.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You wanted him gone too. You sent
dialog: him to me.
text: Allen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper.
text: Lucien won't let go -- it's a tug of war between the two
text: boys, two wills. Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip and
text: wins. Lucien, panicking.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Please. You'll kill me with that.
text: Allen turns and races towards the exit of the prison.
text: Desperate, Lucien calls out after him.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Allen! No!
text: Allen doesn't turn. An alarm HAMMERS through the prison.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Allen! No! DON'T...!
text: CUT TO BLACK.

scene_heading: EXT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT
scene_heading: SUPER: PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. 1943. ONE YEAR EARLIER.
text: Over a strip of working-class row homes, we hear the sounds
text: of a radio announcer giving a dispatch from the war front.
speaker_heading: RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: American daylight bombers were busy
dialog: again, as our liberators with
text: fighter escort continue the air
text: offensive with another sock at
dialog: German coastal installations in
dialog: France.
scene_heading: INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT
text: The radio continues playing to a modest home. We see a young
text: man cleaning house, sweeping in the background.
speaker_heading: RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: But the Germans report a big new
text: red army push toward Romania. This
dialog: is World War news.
text: As the war report ends, a stuffy musical piece begins. We
text: hear a groan from the young man.
text: From out of the background emerges Allen Ginsberg (now 17,
text: fresh-faced, horn-rimmed glasses, dutiful son). The kind of
dialog: kid who takes care of everything.
text: He storms up to the radio, switches the station to a fast-
text: paced boogie-woogie number. He smiles and dances joyfully to
text: the up-beat number with his broom.
text: The door slams. Allen looks up, caught in the act, to see his
dialog: father LOUIS (40's, school teacher, Jewish working-class
text: poet) home from work. Allen accidentally drops the broom.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: How was she today?
text: Louis turns off the music. The playful mood dies. Allen spots
text: the mail in his father's hand.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Fine. Anything for me?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Why? You expecting something?
text: Allen looks down, a bad liar.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: No.
text: Suddenly, from upstairs, the sound of glass shattering. Then
text: a woman whimpering in pain. Allen, worried, looks off, dread
text: in his face. His father just sighs.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I told you it wouldn't work.
text: Allen rushes upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT
text: Allen runs into a dark room, flips on the light.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Mom?
dialog: His mother NAOMI (early 40's, Jewish, deep personality
text: disorder) squats in the corner of the room, in a dirty
text: bathrobe. Her knuckles are bleeding.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You've got to get me out of here.
dialog: He nailed the windows shut while I
text: was in the bath.
text: She motions to the shattered window pane across the room.
text: Allen sees her blood on the sill, where she tried to escape.
text: He moves towards her, to console her. What he's good at.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Dad didn't do that. I nailed the
dialog: windows. Because you're not right.
text: Naomi, in the midst of a paranoid attack, puts her finger to
text: her mouth.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Shhh...Allen. He can hear you!
text: Allen wraps his mother's hand with a dish towel.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You have to rest. Clear your head.
dialog: Do you want to go back to
dialog: Greystone?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: He wouldn't dare put me back there.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Then listen to me.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: SHHHH. He can hear you!
text: She's losing it. Allen quickly thinks, turns to her bureau.
text: He pulls out a RECORD, starts the phonograph and turns up the
dialog: volume.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Can he still hear me?
text: A BRAHMS WALTZ plays.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: What did you say?
text: Allen turns the music up all the way. Allen mimes deafness.
text: Finally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the
dialog: music.
text: Allen reaches for her. She finally softens, takes his hand.
text: As mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi
text: clutches Allen to her, like he's the only thing keeping her
text: sane. Because he is.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Don't ever leave me.
text: Allen, trapped, over her shoulder.
text: From the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the
dialog: whole time.
scene_heading: EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
text: Overwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. She's not
text: well. The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone else's home
text: from down the block. Louis comes out onto the porch, with an
text: open LETTER in hand from the mail pile. He's upset.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Were you even going to tell me you
dialog: applied?!
text: Allen spies the "Columbia University" seal on the front. He's
text: been caught. He looks down, ashamed.
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I didn't want her to know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It was a dream anyway.
text: Louis lights his own cigarette. Offers his son one. He
dialog: declines.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: (talking to himself,
dialog: dreaming)
text: Trilling's there. Van Doren.
dialog: English Professors. Important
dialog: fellows. And New York City, right
dialog: in your goddamn lap.
text: Louis sits beside his son.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Love that is hoarded,
text: molds at last.
text: Allen, surprised to hear his Dad reciting one of his poems.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Until we know,
dialog: the only thing we have--
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: is what we give away.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Is what we hand away. Have, hand.
dialog: Consonance.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Give, is. Assonance.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I wrote the goddamn poem. Go write
dialog: your own.
text: Louis hands over the letter. The hardest thing he's ever
dialog: done.
text: Allen takes the envelope, rips it open. He's looking at the
text: response in shock. Louis tries to read his son's face.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I got in.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You got in?!
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I got into Columbia University!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You got into Columbia University?!
text: Allen and his father embrace.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAY
text: First day of college. Allen crosses the grand Ivy League
text: campus in awe. Before him, the staggering facade of the
text: library like the Parthenon. A troop of Navy midshipmen pass
text: by. Wartime is on.
scene_heading: INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Allen sets his bag on his bed. He notices on one wall are
text: patriotic posters, exercise posters. He's already got a
dialog: roommate.
text: He eyes a map of the New York City subway system. He can't
text: believe he's really here in the big city. He walks over to
dialog: it.
text: Allen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich
dialog: Village.
speaker_heading: LUKE (O.S.)
dialog: You don't wanna go down there.
text: His roommate LUKE, 18, buzz cut, in a sweaty Columbia
text: sweatshirt, leans over him.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Land of the fairies. Head there and
dialog: you never come back.
dialog: (extending a firm hand)
dialog: Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Allen Ginsberg.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (bright smile)
dialog: You're Jewish, right?
text: Allen nods. Luke smacks him on the shoulder.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'm getting good at telling.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY
text: The beautiful main hall of Columbia University's Butler
dialog: Library. It's Ivy League tradition meets thousands of years
dialog: of scholarship.
text: A pompous TOUR GUIDE shows off museum-like glass vitrines to
text: new and prospective students with their families.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: The South Hall library is a church,
dialog: and these are the sacraments.
text: Allen stumbles along on the tour. The tour guide points to
dialog: the contents of the vitrines: the wonders of literary
dialog: history.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: Original folios of the most
dialog: important texts in history.
dialog: Beowolf. First folio Hamlet. The
dialog: Gutenberg Bible.
text: Allen looks down, amazed. That's Shakespeare's handwriting.
speaker_heading: TOUR
dialog: These are among the University's
text: most prized possessions.
text: Suddenly, in a reflection in the glass, a flash of RED
text: catches Allen's eye.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (O.S.)
dialog: Let's hear a bit, shall we?
text: Allen turns to see Lucien Carr (now 19, devilish, stunningly
text: handsome) LEAP onto a library desk with a book in hand. He
text: wears a distinctive red CRAVAT that only the truly beautiful
text: can pull off. The entire room hushes.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: (reciting)
dialog: On a Sunday afternoon, when the
text: shutters are down and the
dialog: proletariat possesses the street...
text: The tour guide looks around confused.
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: ...there are certain thoroughfares
dialog: which remind one of nothing less...
text: Lucien gets on his knees and THRUSTS a lamp between his legs.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: ...than a big cancerous cock.
text: Parents look around in shock. A female student is instantly
text: aroused. The prim PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN clomps over.
scene_heading: PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
dialog: What is this nonsense?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Henry Miller.
scene_heading: PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
dialog: Get down immediately. That book is
dialog: restricted.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Which is why I committed it to
dialog: memory.
scene_heading: PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
dialog: Security!
text: As two Campus Security Guards rush in, Lucien leaps down in
text: front of Allen.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Alert the press! Tell them Lucien
dialog: Carr is innocent!
text: Lucien flees, rushes out of the library.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: That was highly unusual. Campus is
text: actually quite quiet. Moving on.
text: But Allen doesn't hear, he grins to himself. Who the hell was
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES (V.O.)
dialog: The Victorian sonnet has the
dialog: balance of three tenets.
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: Patrician, old-guard PROFESSOR STEEVES lectures on the first
text: day of class, Allen dutifully taking notes in his journal.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: Rhyme, meter, conceit. Without this
text: balance, a poem becomes slack,
text: sloppy. An untucked shirt.
text: Allen disagrees and raises his hand.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Professor Steeves, then how do you
dialog: explain Whitman?
text: No one interrupts Professor Steeves. Murmurs from around the
text: class. Steeves locks down his gaze on Allen.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: Say more. Two more sentences.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: He hated rhyme and meter. The whole
dialog: point was untucking your shirt.
text: Professor Steeves smiles to himself. There's one of them
dialog: every year.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Allen Ginsberg.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: Ginsberg? Your father perhaps is
dialog: the poet Louis Ginsberg?
text: Allen nods.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
text: He writes rhyming, metered verse.
dialog: Why do you think he chose that
dialog: form?
text: All eyes on Allen.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Because it's easier.
text: The class titters. Professor Steeves hushes them.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: This university exists because of
dialog: tradition and form. Would you
dialog: rather this building be built by
dialog: engineers or Whitman and his boys
dialog: at play?
dialog: 11.
text: Allen, realizing he is trapped, unable to answer. Professor
text: Steeves smiles victoriously and writes on the blackboard.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: There can be no creation before
dialog: imitation.
text: The other students take note. Allen sighs, follows suit. From
text: the back row, Lucien watches Allen and unsheathes a grin.
scene_heading: INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Luke, dressed in a suit, puts on cologne. He looks back at
text: Allen who is copying from a tome of sonnets.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Shut the books. We're taking my
dialog: brother with us to the social. He
text: ships out tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I can't. You see how much I've got
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: He's Navy. It's catnip for the
dialog: skirts.
text: Luke pulls out his own waistband and sprays some cologne down
text: the front. Allen shakes his head. Luke shrugs.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You hymies are really all about
dialog: work, huh?
text: Luke slams the door behind. Allen, alone stares out the
dialog: window.
text: A record starts up down the hall. Clarinet, strings. Allen's
text: ears prick up. He knows this tune.
text: It's the same BRAHMS from his mother's bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Allen walks down a darkened hallway, the music leading him
text: forward. He reaches a door with a lit transom. He knocks.
text: The unlocked door creaks open.
dialog: 12.
scene_heading: INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: A mattress lies on the floor, a phonograph on top. Candles
text: light the room. Books for furniture. And Lucien on the floor,
text: reading the Times and smoking.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Brahms?
text: Allen walks inside. Lucien looks up, surprised.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
text: Finally. An oasis in this
text: wasteland.
text: Nervous, Allen tries to make conversation.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: How come you're not at the social?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Only the most anti-social have to
dialog: go to an event actually called one.
dialog: Libation?
text: Lucien rises and grabs a wine bottle corked with a sock.
text: Allen looks nervously towards the door.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You drink in your room?!
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: How does a horrible bottle of
dialog: Chianti sound?
text: Lucien inverts two small glasses and pours. Allen stares. He
dialog: doesn't break the rules.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I don't drink.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Freshman?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Yes.
text: Lucien hands him his glass.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Excellent. I love first times. I
dialog: want my whole life to be composed
dialog: of them. Life is only interesting
dialog: if life is wide.
dialog: 13.
text: Lucien toasts Allen's glass.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: To Walt Whitman, you dirty bastard.
text: Allen, mortified, not sure how to take that reference as
text: Lucien knocks his wine back in one gulp.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: How's your Yeats? Have you read A
dialog: Vision?
text: He tosses Allen a BOOK. Dog-eared, underlined and crumbling.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Never heard of it.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: It's completely brilliant and
dialog: impossible. He says life is round:
dialog: we're stuck on this wheel. Living.
dialog: And dying.
text: Allen opens the book, looks through the old pages, sees a
text: strange symbol: a diagram of a celestial WHEEL.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
text: An endless circle. Until. Someone
dialog: breaks it. You came in here, you
dialog: rupture the pattern. Bang: the
dialog: whole world...
speaker_heading: ALLEN LUCIEN
text: Gets wider. Gets wider.
text: Lucien looks at Allen, amazed.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: How did you...?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
text: Consonance. Reiteration of themes.
text: Lucien, intrigued, circles in close.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Are you a writer? Because I've got
text: a job for a writer.
text: Allen, mesmerized.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: No. I'm not.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Well, you're not anything yet.
text: This boy so close, the rush of contact. From down the hall...
speaker_heading: HALL MONITOR (O.S.)
dialog: Ginsberg?!
text: Allen doesn't even register his name. Lucien smirks.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Isn't that you?
speaker_heading: HALL MONITOR (O.S.)
dialog: Ginsberg?!
text: Allen groans, snaps out of it.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: HALL MONITOR (O.S.)
dialog: Phone call!
text: Allen reluctantly hands Lucien back the BOOK.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I'll be back.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The Hall Monitor hands Allen the phone.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: NAOMI (O.S.)
dialog: I found the wires.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT
text: Naomi grips the phone desperately. We see she has stripped
text: the wallpaper from the wall and pulled the telephone wire out
text: from underneath.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
text: He's trying to get inside my head.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (O.S.)
text: Dad is not trying to get inside
dialog: your head, okay? Put him on.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
text: He's not home. He left.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Allen, confused. Up the hallway, a door locks.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Where'd he go?
scene_heading: INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT
text: Naomi looks out the window, does not want to answer.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Honey, I need you come home now.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (O.S.)
dialog: Mom I can't come home. Listen, you
dialog: have to look after yourself.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I don't feel good.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Lucien passes Allen, putting on his coat, heading out to the
dialog: city.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: (whispered, to Lucien)
dialog: You're going to the dance?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: No. Downtown.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (O.S.)
dialog: Who are you talking to? Is he there
dialog: with you?!
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: No, he's not here with me.
text: Lucien quickly waves goodbye to Allen, heads down the
text: staircase. Allen, torn between his mother and this boy.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Listen, I'll come as soon as I can.
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT
text: Naomi, clutches the phone, deadly serious.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: You need to promise.
scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Lucien slides down the stairway rail. Allen watching him
dialog: disappear.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Yes. Ipromiseloveyoubye.
text: Allen hangs up on his mother and races after Lucien.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
text: Allen, breathless, storms down a flight of stairs, catches up
text: to Lucien. Lucien turns, loving this. The puppy following his
dialog: new master.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Coming?
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBIA ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: Lucien throws his jacket over Allen's shoulder and leads him
text: into the wild city around the corner.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Welcome to the edge of the world.
text: The sound of the IRT screeching takes us to the SUBWAY MAP
text: from Allen's dorm room which comes to life.
text: A RED LINE glides down the map from Columbia University all
dialog: the way...to Greenwich Village.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STAIRS/APARTMENT, 48 MORTON STREET - NIGHT
text: Allen, anxious, follows Lucien up a crowded staircase to a
dialog: West Village apartment.
text: The sounds of a party spill out onto the landing and beyond.
dialog: It's pure bohemia here.
dialog: 17.
text: Smoke, artists flirting, arguing. Allen sees...
text: A black man making out with a white woman. An older, elegant
text: woman sharing a cigarette with a boy half her age.
text: She stares seductively at Allen. Lucien enjoying himself
text: immensely. This is what a first time looks like.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Allen in Wonderland.
text: Lucien grabs a DRUNK YOUNG GIRL from the crowd, kisses her
text: passionately. Then lets her go, keeps walking.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Do you know her?!
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: No, and I don't plan on it. She
dialog: tasted like imported sophistication
dialog: and domestic cigarettes.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A makeshift bar in a sink full of ice. Lucien scavenges
text: through empty bottles in the sink, looking for any remaining
dialog: alcohol.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Dave! Where's the liquor?! I'll be
dialog: right back.
text: As Lucien walks off, Allen tries to make himself
text: inconspicuous and sits down on the tub.
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: Hrffrff hrffrfffrfrfrrf.
text: Allen looks down to see WILLIAM BURROUGHS (aka BILL, 29,
text: tall, gaunt, wry), in a suit, sprawled out in the bathtub: a
text: gas mask over his mouth. Bill motions to the side of the tub.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (through the mask)
dialog: You're...pinching...
text: Allen stands up, realizing his foot is on a snaking black
text: tube leading to a metal canister of gas.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Sorry. Are you all right?
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (long exhale)
text: Artifacts in the visual field, some
dialog: light-headedness. Motor
dialog: hyperactivity.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Nitrous oxide, for narcoanalysis.
dialog: Know thyself. And beshit thyself.
dialog: Ever done that?
text: Allen shakes his head no. Bill turns off the gas. Offers a
dialog: joint to Allen.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Oh no, thanks. I don't do...the
dialog: cannabis.
text: Bill eyes Allen, skeptically.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Show me the man both sober and
dialog: happy, and I'll show you the
text: crinkled anus of a lying asshole.
text: Allen raises an eyebrow. Lucien returns with a paper in hand.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Allen, Willy. Willy, Allen, Lucien
dialog: reefer.
text: Lucien takes the joint.
text: Bill puts the tube of gas back in his mouth, back to
text: business. Lucien grabs Allen's hand, pulls him to the party.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Is he a criminal?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: He wishes he were a criminal. The
dialog: Burroughs family is richer than
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
text: He looks like a criminal.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: He's a Harvard man, and he's going
dialog: to be an amazing artist. His
dialog: current medium is himself.
text: Allen spots the TERM PAPER in Lucien's hand.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Bunk for school. Now, come on, I
dialog: want you to meet our host.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: DAVID KAMMERER, the man we saw dead at the film's opening,
text: runs his fingers on the rim of a wine glass. He's sharp, the
text: mayor of this scene. An eerie hum from the glass.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What there is, darlings and
dialog: demoiselles, is a circle. Life is
text: round. Patterns, routines, a wheel
dialog: of self-abuse. Margaret, don't even
dialog: deny it.
text: Allen turns to Lucien.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Sounds like you.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Because it was me. First.
text: David sees the boys talking. He eyes Allen, curiously.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Until. The the disruption we long
dialog: for, comes along and the circle is
dialog: broken.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: (whispered, to Allen)
dialog: He said he was my guardian angel,
dialog: but that I was too much work.
text: David crosses through crowd towards Allen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Take this unbloomed stalwart.
dialog: 20.
text: Uh-oh. Allen's singled out. David pulls him to the center of
dialog: the room.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And you are?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Allen.
text: Bill walks in, knows what game his friend is playing.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Play nice, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Allen, who comes uninvited to my
dialog: apartment.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Actually I invited him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: None of us notice him. Look at him.
dialog: Why would we bother?
text: In his tucked shirt and creased pants, Allen realizes the
text: entire party is scrutinizing, judging him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So the pattern of our evening, our
dialog: lives, holds. But under the right
dialog: circumstances, even he might change
dialog: the world.
text: Jazz music sparks, PRE-LAP from where this party's going
text: next. Lucien eyes Allen -- an idea forming.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TAVERN - NIGHT
text: The party continuing at this underground speakeasy. Straight,
text: gay, young, old, a subterranean zoo. A jazz signer owns the
dialog: room.
text: Bill, David, and Allen at a table. David's moment alone with
dialog: Allen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So you just met Lucien in the lunch
dialog: line and now he's all that you can
dialog: see.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Why don't you like me?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Because David was in the same
dialog: godforsaken line.
text: David and Bill share a knowing look. Lucien returns to the
text: table and slams a glass down.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
text: Some earjob at the bar just called
dialog: me "boy." So I stole his drink.
text: Allen scans, sees the famous poet OGDEN NASH looking around
dialog: for his glass.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: That's Ogden Nash!
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Who's Ogden Nash?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: The best selling poet in the
dialog: country.
speaker_heading: BILL
text: "A girl who is bespectacled. She
text: may not get her nectacled. But
dialog: safety pins and bassinets--"
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: "Await the girl who fassinets."
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: And that's what he's selling?! I'll
dialog: kill him.
text: Bill takes out a switchblade.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Aim for the throat.
text: A realization. Lucien leans in, focuses his charm.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: No. We're not going to kill him.
dialog: Even better. We're going make sure
text: nobody remembers him.
dialog: (turns to Allen)
dialog: How many men started the
dialog: Renaissance?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Two.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: And the Romantics.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: More than I suspect this theory
dialog: accommodates.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: (Five?)
text: Lucien's passion building.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: We're sending millions to fight the
dialog: Fascists in Europe, but they're
dialog: here! Meter and rhyme---
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: And Professor Steeves---
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Yes! They're all guards in some
dialog: prison. Let's make the prisoners
dialog: come out and play. Let's come up
text: with new words, new rhythms.
text: Allen, swept up in the energy. He couldn't be more
text: captivated.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: We need a name.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: How did they come up "Dada"?
speaker_heading: BILL
text: Tristan Tzara jabbed a knife into a
dialog: dictionary.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Shit. So that's been done.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A literary revolution without
dialog: writing a word. Neat trick, Lu.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Well, I'm listening.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: What about Yeats? How about the
dialog: "New Vision?"
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Ginsy, you're hired!
text: Allen smiles a mile wide. He's in.
text: Suddenly, the jazz singer stops. The band puts down their
text: instruments. POLICEMEN escort a businessman and another
text: gentleman out of the bathroom, in HANDCUFFS. The mood in the
text: bar chills.
speaker_heading: BAR-GOER (O.S.)
dialog: Fucking perverts.
text: Allen, terrified, looks at David, who looks back, knowing
dialog: exactly now who Allen is.
text: A DOOR CRASH leads us to...
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - DAWN
text: Drunk, Allen and Lucien stumble to the ground.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
text: "In the dawn, armed with a burning
dialog: patience, we shall enter the
dialog: splendid city!"
text: Allen sits up.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: It's Rimbaud. It's overwritten, I
dialog: know. He's allowed.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: No, my mother. This is bad. This is
dialog: very bad.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: What is?
text: Allen stands, gathers himself urgently. He needs to be
dialog: somewhere about twelve hours ago.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: She's going to be furious.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Don't go then.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You don't understand. I have to.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: It's complicated.
text: Lucien sees his friend scared. Moved, he links his arm with
dialog: Allen's.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Perfect. I love complicated.
scene_heading: INT. GINSBERG HOME - DAY
text: Allen and Lucien enter the house to find Louis standing
text: nervously with a suitcase beside a DOCTOR.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Greystone will alert you if there's
text: a change in her condition.
text: A DOCTOR holds out a clipboard. Louis sheepishly signs the
dialog: document on top.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Dad, what's going on?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Your mother needs her rest.
text: A male nurse leads Naomi from the bedroom. She is still in
text: her robe, shattered and fogged by sedatives. Allen realizes
dialog: what's happening.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: (to his father)
dialog: You can't do this to her.
text: Naomi recognizes her son.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Where were you?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I was out. With a friend.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I called you!
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: It's time to go, Mrs. Ginsberg.
text: The nurse takes Naomi to the door. Allen pulls her back, into
dialog: the house.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: No, you're not leaving.
text: Naomi points an accusing finger at Louis.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: He already signed the papers.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Dad?!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It's for the best.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Your best.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It's for her best. It's not for my
dialog: best. Look at her! Listen to her!
text: Naomi babbling. Allen realizing how far she's gone. Allen
text: shoves the nurse off Naomi.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Get off!
text: From deep within, Allen can see she is still there, and we
text: can see she knows that it's too late.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: This is your fault.
text: The nurse escorts a docile Naomi out of the room. Allen
text: breaks down. Lucien, mute witness to it all.
text: MUSIC PLAYS over...
scene_heading: INT. GINSBERG HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Louis lectures Allen.
text: We close in on Allen's despondent face. The dutiful son's
dialog: first failure.
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
text: Allen escapes outside where Lucien is sitting, smoking. Allen
text: sits beside him, notices: Lucien has been crying.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Complicated enough?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: At least you have her. My father
dialog: left me when I was four.
text: A beat of understanding between them. Lucien lays down. Allen
text: takes his cigarette, lays next to him.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I've been thinking about what Yeats
dialog: said. To be reborn, we have to die
dialog: first.
text: Allen hands him back the smoke. Lucien perks up.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: So what do you suggest?
scene_heading: INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: Candlelight flickers on Allen's face.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I've spent my life making other
dialog: people happy.
text: We PULL BACK to see a noose around Allen's neck. A suicide is
dialog: underway.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: It's time I find happiness the only
dialog: way I see possible.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (O.S.)
dialog: Oh please. Die already.
text: We PULL BACK again to see Lucien beside, also with a noose
text: around his neck. Both of them on chairs. Their nooses are
text: attached to the same pipe.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Where's the verve? The brio?!
text: From atop the chair, Lucien kicks his record player with his
text: foot. Grand classical music screeches to a start.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: If it be that I am indulging my
dialog: self-consciousness in justifying
dialog: myself, or if it be--
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: That's a run-on.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Don't edit me!
text: Lucien shoves Allen. Allen trips off the chair, the noose
text: snaps tight...and suddenly he's hanging in mid-air. He
text: struggles. Lucien tries to help, but falls off his own chair.
text: The pipe starts to bend.
text: Allen and Lucien panic as they swing through the room,
text: suspended in air.
text: The pipe BREAKS. They crash to the ground.
text: A beat of relief -- are we alive? -- and the two break out
text: into hysterics.
scene_heading: DIRTY BE-BOP JAZZ PLAYS OVER...
text: A RED LINE TRAVELS UP THE SUBWAY MAP FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY
text: TO HARLEM BRINGING US TO...
scene_heading: INT. HARLEM NIGHTCLUB (MINTON'S PLAYHOUSE) - NIGHT
text: The black crowd claps for the same jazz singer and band we
text: saw earlier, now on their home turf. Allen, Lucien and Bill
text: watch from a table.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (O.S.)
dialog: The New Vision declares--
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (O.S.)
dialog: "Proclaims" is better--
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY
text: Lucien and Allen pace while Bill reclines on the sofa. They
text: riff on the The New Vision manifesto.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Proclaims the death of morality.
dialog: And...
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: The expression of self.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
text: The true, uninhibited, uncensored
dialog: expression of the self.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Words, boys. Empty words.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Then what do you suggest?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: The derangement of the senses.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
text: Allen bopping his head to the new rhythms in this club - the
dialog: place where be-bop jazz is being born.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - DAY
text: Bill cracking open a Benzedrine canister and removing the
text: soaking strip from inside.
text: He drops it into three coffee cups. The boys knock it back,
text: Lucien pushing Allen to finish the whole drink.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DORM - DAY
text: Allen furiously typing up the manifesto at his school desk.
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: What do you hate from the pit of
dialog: your gut?
scene_heading: INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - DAY
text: Allen, Lucien pacing with increasing excitement.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Institutions.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Paterson, New Jersey.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: My father.
text: Bill smiles. They're playing his game.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Bingo.
text: The music suddenly stops as we ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: Professor Steeves lecturing before the class.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: And so while Shakespeare...
text: He notices Allen's empty seat. Unhappy.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: All right.
text: The MUSIC builds again as...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
text: ...a drummer takes a wild solo. Enraptured, Allen taps his
dialog: fingers to these new rhythms.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Allen's fingers typing in these same rhythms. Beside, The New
text: Yorker advertising Ogden Nash's upcoming reading.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (O.S.)
dialog: Extraordinary men propel society
dialog: forward. It is our duty to break
dialog: the law.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - DAY
text: Allen stopping Lucien in his tracks.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: It's how we make the world wider.
dialog: Allen considers, agrees.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You are an extraordinary man.
text: Lucien beams.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Well, thank you.
scene_heading: INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - AN HOUR LATER
text: Bill at David's bookcase, removing classic art and literature
text: books and throwing them to Allen.
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: "Return of the Native."
dialog: "Leviathan." Tear `em up boys.
dialog: Destroy the old and build the new!
text: Allen, with scissors, cuts up pages of the books. Hands them
text: to Lucien who nails them to the wall.
text: It's a frantic assembly-line: Bill whips books to Allen,
text: Allen tears out sections, and Lucien hammers them up.
text: We PULL BACK to see the entire wall is covered in words.
scene_heading: INT. HARLEM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
text: Time suddenly slows. The music tapers, the hands of the
text: drummer taper down to a still. Allen looks around, scared and
dialog: confused. What is happening?
text: A spotlight cuts through the room, capturing the singer's
text: sweaty ecstasy, the bassist's fingers mid-plucking. The room
text: freezes.
text: Unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, Allen turns to Bill.
dialog: 31.
text: Bill holds up his finger - it is on fire. He lights Allen's
text: cigarette with the flame. We have entered into another
dialog: universe.
text: Lucien stands -- the only thing moving -- and Allen follows.
text: He steps into the frozen moment. And it's beautiful.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Watch this.
text: Lucien leans over a young woman, a statue at a table with a
text: young man in military attire.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: (whispered in her ear)
dialog: Go.
text: The girl comes to life and clambers over the young man to a
text: second, more attractive soldier. And kisses him. The pair
text: erupt into life, into desire.
text: Lucien and Allen sit on the stage beneath the frozen
text: musicians. Lucien pulls out a BOY SCOUT KNIFE.
text: Wraps Allen's hand in a fist around the blade.
text: He pulls the knife free. Allen winces in pain.
text: Lucien does the same to his own palm, then presses their two
text: bloody hands together. A ceremony. Allen's eyes roll back.
text: David appears in a janitor uniform. The Technicolor fades.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What the hell is this?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Allen, the nitrous oxide mask over his face inhaling from a
text: tank of gas. He has been adrift in a hallucination.
text: Lucien presses Allen's hand back and forth, both unharmed.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Time slows down as you drift deeper
dialog: and deeper into your cave...
text: Bill notices David, turns off the gas.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: We are exploring the avenues of
dialog: Allen's mind.
text: David looks around the mess of his living room, his pillaged
text: library of books, papers all over the floor.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Dimly-lit, I am sure. What have you
dialog: done to my apartment?
text: Allen struggles to his feet, moaning. Lucien steps between
text: David and their wall of clippings.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: David, don't touch anything. We
dialog: have to write it all down.
text: Bill stands up, woozy. Calls out to David.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Get this man a pair of scissors!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This is not your revolution, this
dialog: is my life.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What kind of life is it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's mine. Not everyone gets an
dialog: allowance.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Leave. Get out!
text: Allen stumbles out of the room, scared. David approaches
dialog: Lucien.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I need to speak to you. Alone.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Allen splashes water on his face. In the mirror, he sees
text: David and Lucien in the bedroom.
text: David hands Lucien a TERM PAPER.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (O.S.)
dialog: It only has to be five pages.
dialog: 33.
text: He tilts the mirror to see them clearly. A glimpse into their
dialog: private dynamic.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Lucien flips through the term paper.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You make me too smart, they're
dialog: gonna suspect something's up.
text: David throws Lucien's coat over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And get you sent back to your
dialog: mother again? That would just be
dialog: the end of you.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Fuck you.
text: David spots Allen watching from the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Allen, caught, looks down, pretends he heard nothing. But
text: it's too late. David walks over and SLAMS the door in Allen's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES (O.S.)
dialog: Kill your darlings.
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: Professor Steeves, intent, in front of the class.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: Your crushes, your juvenile
dialog: metaphysics. None of them belong on
dialog: the page. It is the first principle
dialog: of good creative work. A work of
dialog: fiction you will deliver as your
dialog: final exam.
text: He sees Allen, badly hungover and brooding, writing in a
text: journal. Ignoring class.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: Oh look. Whitman Jr. graced us with
dialog: his presence today.
dialog: 34.
text: Steeves walks to Allen's desk, grabs his journal.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: "The New Vision. Extraordinary men
dialog: propel us forward. It is our duty
dialog: to break the law."
dialog: (to Allen)
dialog: Fantastic.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: There's more life in those five
dialog: pages than in the dozens of bad
dialog: sonnets we've read in class.
text: Steeves cocks his eye, stares down Allen. The first time
dialog: Allen has defied anyone. Ever.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: You want life? You want the world
dialog: on fire?
text: Steeves motions to the door. Then to Allen.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR STEEVES
dialog: The war awaits. What will it be?
text: Steeves tosses the journal back down on Allen's desk.
text: Allen looks down at the "New Vision", ashamed.
scene_heading: INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: A rainstorm beating against the windows. Allen paces as a
text: drunk Lucien knocks off a bottle of wine and reads from
dialog: Allen's journal.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: "The rose that scents the summer
dialog: air/ grows from my beloved's
dialog: hair...?"
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Keep going. That's my sonnet for
dialog: Steeves.
text: Lucien flips through the journal, closes it, disappointed.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: We have the map. We have the
dialog: manifesto. We need the work.
dialog: (suddenly cold)
dialog: I was wrong. Maybe you're not up
dialog: for this after all.
dialog: 35.
text: Allen stares at Lucien in disbelief. Shocked, Allen rushes to
text: Lucien's desk.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Show me your fucking map.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Stop!
text: Allen grabs the pages Lucien has been working on: they are
text: covered in doodles - there's nothing there.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Oh right, you don't have anything
dialog: because David's not here to write
dialog: it for you!
text: Lucien stands up, drunk. Furious.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: It's complicated.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I love complicated.
text: Lucien steadies himself. Furious.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: He's a professor working as a
text: janitor so he can be near his
dialog: precious Lu-Lu. He is a goddamn
dialog: fruit who won't let me go.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: A fruit?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: A queer.
text: This detonates inside Allen. Lucien crashes to his bed. Allen
text: sits beside.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Then let's get rid of him.
text: Lucien softens, leans against Allen. Passing out from the
dialog: liquor.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Right now, I just need you to write
dialog: us something beautiful.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: First thought, best thought.
dialog: 36.
text: Lucien drifts off. Allen shakes, holding Lucien's body for
dialog: the first time.
text: We follow Allen's P.O.V. as he runs his finger through
text: Lucien's hair. He can barely breathe, this close to what he
dialog: finds beautiful.
text: Allen's fingers slide to Lucien's cheek. Toward his lips.
text: Lucien's eyes open. Allen tenses, afraid. But Lucien suddenly
text: takes Allen's finger in his mouth. Sucks it, eyeing Allen the
dialog: whole time.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A thunder-clap. Lucien passed out in Allen's lap. We were
text: just in Allen's imagination.
scene_heading: INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Allen at his typewriter. A blank page. Inspired to write
dialog: something beautiful.
text: We see flashes of the past, snippets of Lucien: their
text: contact, Lucien's smile. Allen searching through their past.
text: All playing in reverse.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Allen in Wonderland.
text: Is it something? He writes the words down. Flash of their
text: past build in a crescendo as he keeps searching, digging
dialog: through moments, leading to...
text: NOTHING.
text: Allen's blocked.
dialog: He'll need more help if he's going to get to beautiful.
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: Pervitin.
scene_heading: INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Bill with NORMAN (30s, shady, real criminal) and Allen in his
text: dim, bookshelf-lined lair. Bill gives the secret nod to
dialog: Norman.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: The Germans call it the "wonder
dialog: drug." Prescribed for super-human
dialog: feats.
text: Norman pops open a briefcase full of drugs. Bill selects a
text: green pill bottle and gives it to Allen.
scene_heading: INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Allen pops two. Waits for it.
scene_heading: INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - LATER
text: The pace of everything has DOUBLED.
text: Allen, sweating at his typewriter, jubilant, tapping his foot
text: with the music, typing furiously at the keys. Whatever this
dialog: drug is, it's working.
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: But beware of the side-effects.
scene_heading: INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Bill rattles off the list.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sudden blindness, bouts of
text: diarrhea, heart palpitations, and a
dialog: severe decline in moral standards.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Allen jerking-off at his desk.
text: Allen racing around his room, burning off energy. The
text: memories are now flooding in.
text: David at his party...
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: Take this unbloomed stalwart.
text: Lucien at the bar...
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (O.S.)
dialog: Let the prisoners come out and
dialog: play.
scene_heading: INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - EVENING
text: Luke enters, turns on the light.
text: His jaw-drops: Allen is on his bed, running in place like a
dialog: mad-man.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
text: Allen, furious at the interruption.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Writing!
scene_heading: INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Bill, a thoughtful eye on young Allen.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: But the words, oh the words...
scene_heading: INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Allen's got it. He rips the pages from the typewriter.
scene_heading: INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Lucien's door slams open. A sleepless Allen, hair on end,
text: storms into the room, fresh pages in hand.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Lu! It's very rough but...
text: David sits at Lucien's desk, writing. Allen stops short.
text: David spies the pages in Allen's hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah. The "Vision" at last. Can I
dialog: see?
text: Allen hides them behind his back.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Where's Lu?
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: He's out. With a senior, some
dialog: football player. A writer and
dialog: handsome too.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: James? Jack. There it is. Jack.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You're not allowed to be here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's odd since I'm the only thing
dialog: keeping him here.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Not anymore.
text: A stand-off. David collects his jacket, approaches.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Piece of advice. You don't know Lu.
dialog: As soon you think you do, he'll
dialog: find someone else.
text: David smirks, walks off leaving Allen alone with his pages.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Or maybe he already has.
scene_heading: INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
text: 3:00 AM. Allen snoring. Then the sound of the door creaking
text: open. Allen wakes up to see Lucien entering.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: What are you, moving in?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Where have you been?!
text: Lucien starts getting undressed.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: I found a real writer. Already a
text: million words under his belt before
dialog: Columbia.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You mean Jack?
text: Lucien fumbles.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: What am I supposed to do?
dialog: Newsreels?
text: He spots the piece of paper in Allen's hand.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: What's that?
text: Defensive, Allen pockets his poem for Lucien.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Nothing.
text: Lucien gets into bed.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: If you're going to stay, don't hog
dialog: the blanket.
text: Lucien closes his eyes. Allen sits up, jealous, his mind
text: spinning. He stares at Lucien.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Why is Jack a real writer?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Once you meet him, you'll see what
dialog: I mean.
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: Hey Al!
scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Handsome JACK KEROUAC (mid-20's, athletic, infamous jaw)

speaker_heading: EDIE (O.S.)
dialog: Jack? What was that?
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (with a wink)
dialog: The damn cat!
text: The bell around the neck of Jack's cat KIT KAT jingles as it

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (whispered to Allen)
dialog: She painted it. Say nothing.
text: Jack notices a piece of mail addressed to him next to Allen.
text: It's an old vinyl RECORD sent by his friend Sammy. He shouts
text: down the hall.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hey when'd this come?
speaker_heading: EDIE (O.S.)
dialog: Today. Where is Sammy now?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I dunno. Some battleship.
text: Lucien nods to the huge manuscript on Allen's lap. We realize
dialog: it is Jack's novel The Sea Is My Brother.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: What do you think? Brilliant, no?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: It's missing some periods and
dialog: commas.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: It's better than anything you've
dialog: ever written.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I use periods and commas.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Both of you! Quiet!

speaker_heading: VOICE OF SAMMY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sammy, you bastard.

speaker_heading: LUCIEN

speaker_heading: JACK

text: Off in the Navy.
speaker_heading: VOICE OF SAMMY (O.S.)
dialog: We've just been through 20 days of

speaker_heading: EDIE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: VOICE OF SAMMY (O.S.)
dialog: It's supposed to be beautiful...
text: Jack pulls the stylus off.
text: EDIE PARKER, Jack's wealthy, vivacious art student girlfriend

text: holds a pot, eyes Lucien and Allen.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: I didn't know we were having
dialog: guests.
text: Jack comes to the table. She smacks something down on a
text: plate: it's brown GLOP.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: I was aiming for stew.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You missed.

speaker_heading: EDIE

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Out.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: Out? I cooked all day for you.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What do you want me to do? Eat shoe
dialog: leather? I'm hungry and what you do
text: in the kitchen is unholy.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: That's funny. You talk like a
dialog: Catholic. But you fuck me and won't
dialog: marry me. How does that work?
text: Allen and Lucien watch entranced.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Shut your mouth, Edie.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: I thought you liked it WIDE OPEN...

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Not exactly. It's...
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: It's all true. Jack served in the
dialog: Merchant Marines.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I've left school twice already.
dialog: Columbia's full of squares. I'm not
dialog: even sure why I bothered to come
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Then why don't you just ship out
dialog: again?
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Trust me. Sometimes when I fight

text: Lucien stops. He spots a DINGY, floating off a dock. He gets
dialog: an idea.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You two did just fight.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Carr, you're goddamn crazy.

scene_heading: EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT
text: The dingy drifts into view in the middle of the busiest river
text: in the world - quiet at this late in the night. Jack rowing.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: A "new vision?"
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: Sounds phony. Movements are cooked
dialog: up by people who can't write about
dialog: the people who can.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Lu, I don't think he gets what
dialog: we're trying to do.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Listen to me, this whole town's
text: full of finks on the 30th floor,
dialog: writing pure chintz. Writers, real
dialog: writers, gotta be in the beds. In
text: the trenches. In all the broken
dialog: places. What're your trenches, Al?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Allen.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right.
text: Allen looks to Lucien for help.

speaker_heading: LUCIEN

speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Fuck you. What does that even

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good. That's one. What else?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Fuck your one million words.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Even better.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You don't know me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're right. Who is you?
text: Lucien loves this, raises an eyebrow. Allen pulls out his
text: poem from his pocket.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Be careful.
dialog: You are not in wonderland
dialog: I have heard the strange madness
dialog: long growing in your soul.
dialog: But you are fortunate.
text: Lucien listens anew, realizing this poem is about him.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: In your ignorance
dialog: In your isolation,
dialog: you who have suffered
dialog: Find where love hides.
dialog: Give. Share. Lose.
dialog: Lest we die unbloomed.
text: Just the sound of the water. Completely vulnerable, Allen
text: sits back down.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Allen. Beautiful, kid.
text: Allen looks up, moved.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You wrote that?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You asked me to. Remember?
text: Lucien lights up. He comes forward, gathers his friends
text: close: gawky, emotional Allen. Blustery, sensitive Jack.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Forget Columbia. Forget Ogden Nash.
dialog: Here's the plan, boys. We join the
dialog: Merchant Marines. Sail the world
text: until the war ends. Then jump ship
dialog: and make it to Paris. For the
dialog: liberation.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You don't speak French.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Jack does. It'll be us, together.
dialog: At the beginning. It'll be the

text: A FLOOD-LAMP and HORN shatter the reverie.

speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Jesus Christ!
speaker_heading: POLICE OFFICER
dialog: Put your hands in the air!

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY

text: He leans in closer.
speaker_heading: DEAN (O.S.)
dialog: You've managed to matriculate and

dialog: University of Chicago.
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: INT. COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Lucien in a leather-backed chair. The DEAN (40's, sardonic)
text: overlooks Lucien's record. Lucien's mother, MARION CARR, a
text: fallen matriarch, smokes with dispassion.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Your attendance record here is
dialog: abominable. You've ignored curfew.
dialog: Your papers, when you bother to
dialog: turn them in, exceed the assigned
dialog: page limit. Can you explain why
dialog: you're at Columbia?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Same reason you're here.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Loose Barnard girls.
text: Marion Carr looks at the Dean with a weary smile.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I know about your difficulties.
dialog: About what happened in Chicago.
text: A pale comes over Lucien's face. Which becomes absolute fury.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: (to Marion)
dialog: You told him?!
speaker_heading: MARION CARR
dialog: He's not the enemy.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: See, the University acts in loco

text: Lucien EXPLODES.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN

speaker_heading: MARION CARR

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY

text: Louis Ginsberg rounds the corner with an unfamiliar woman.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (O.S.)
dialog: Allen? What the hell is going on?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Who's she?
text: The woman, EDITH (early 30s, Jewish, shy), waves nervously.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Hi. I'm Edith Cohen.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: What's she doing here?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: I'll go wait outside.
text: Edith exits down the stairs.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: (smirks)
dialog: So that's why you locked mom up.
dialog: Louis SLAPS his son.
text: Lucien storms out of the Dean's office, followed by Marion,
text: putting on her fur coat. Marion inspects her son's new
text: accomplice then races after her son. Louis motions to Lucien.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Did he put you up to this?
text: Allen stares down his father. Gathering courage to defy him.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: No. I stole the boat. And it was
dialog: tremendous.
scene_heading: EXT. SEMINARY GARDENS - NIGHT
text: In the quiet, Lucien smokes and stares up -- he looks
text: ravaged. A suitcase beside him.
text: Allen approaches, surprised.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Where are you going?
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You know me now. I'm only good at
dialog: beginnings.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You're dropping out?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Best of luck.
text: Allen GRABS Lucien's suitcase and sits beside Lucien. This
text: explodes out of him.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: My father shows up yesterday with
text: some new woman. And in the middle
dialog: of the Allen's-a-screw-up
dialog: monologue, all of a sudden, I
dialog: realize: I don't care. I've never
dialog: not cared. So, I told them it was
dialog: my idea. To steal the boat.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Because I don't want to be the
dialog: person they think I am. I'm on
dialog: academic probation. I could be
dialog: kicked out. You can't leave. You
dialog: started something and I have no
dialog: idea what I'm supposed to do next.
dialog: Lucien, moved.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: It's our turn. Let's show them what
dialog: we can do.

speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You in?
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY
text: A hard STAMP on a library request: RESTRICTED.
scene_heading: PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
dialog: You must not drink while you're

text: Allen, Lucien, Jack and Bill spy on the PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
text: and a female PAGE at the main desk. The librarian places a
text: KEY RING in a drawer.
scene_heading: PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
dialog: It must come back exactly as you
dialog: found it.
text: The Permissions Librarian heads off. Seeing the young page
text: alone, Jack tucks in his shirt, SLICKS his hair down. Jabs a
text: piece of gum from his mouth into Lucien's palm.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No telling Edie, got it?
text: Jack strolls up to the desk. Winks at the page.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I see you checking out all these
dialog: books. And I'm asking myself: do
dialog: you ever get checked out?
text: She radiates. Bill looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: BILL
text: 25 seconds. Masterful.
text: But then, another page, GWENDOLYN (20, sweet and saucy),
text: joins the first.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Damn! Shift's over.
text: Jack looks back, shrugs as he walks off with the first page.
text: Lucien groans, plan's 86'd. But Allen sits up.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I'll go.
scene_heading: INT. PERMISSIONS DESK, LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY
text: Allen walks up to the desk.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Hi.

speaker_heading: ALLEN

speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: Sure.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I'm looking for a book.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: Okay. Does this book have a title?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: It's called The Day Amanda Came.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: (knowing look)
dialog: Well, you'll have to wait. I can't

text: Allen turns back to Lucien who nods, eggs him on.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: But...I really need it.
text: Gwendolyn looks around.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: (flirting)
dialog: Okay. Only for you.
text: She places a sign on the desk: "HELPING A READER. BACK IN 5
dialog: MINUTES."
text: They head off the stacks, Lucien bounds up to the desk,
text: glides over the top, and digs through the drawer.
text: Old cards. Broken pencils. NO KEYS.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Shit!
scene_heading: 60 INT. STACKS - DAY 60
text: CLOSE UP: THE KEYS in Gwendolyn's hand as Allen and Gwendolyn
text: walk through the stacks.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Working here must be a drag.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: I like it. It's the only way I meet
dialog: boys. They're very strict at
dialog: Barnard.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: How strict?
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: For example, they'd never let me do
dialog: this.
text: Gwendolyn LIFTS her sweater. Bares her brassiere.
speaker_heading: ALLEN

scene_heading: INT. PERMISSIONS DESK - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: BILL

scene_heading: INT. STACKS - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: Did you know I've never done it
dialog: with someone who was Jewish before?
dialog: I really want to know what it looks
dialog: like.
text: Gwendolyn paws the front of Allen's pants, undoes his belt.
text: Uncomfortable, Allen stops her.
text: She pulls away, pulls down her sweater. The keys jangling in
text: her hand.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: I'm sorry, I thought you were
text: saying something but not saying it.
dialog: Should we find your book?
text: THROUGH A GAP IN THE STACKS: Allen sees Lucien, pointing to
text: the KEYS in her grip. Realizing what he has to do.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: There is no book. Take it off.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: Really?
text: Gwendolyn sets down the keys. Undoes her cardigan. Lucien
text: nabs the keys and races up the stacks.
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: INT. ROW, LIBRARY STACKS - CONTINUOUS
text: Lucien hands the keys to Bill. Bill PLACES it into a clay
text: molding and makes an impression.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN (O.S.)
dialog: No. Why don't you take it off?
scene_heading: INT. STACKS, LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
text: Allen takes off her sweater. Gwendolyn, just in a bra. This
text: is as close as Allen has ever come to sex. He's breathless.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: It's not like I'm a virgin. I've
dialog: done it with three guys already.
dialog: You're a virgin, huh?
text: She KISSES him. Cold lips. He's terrified.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: You're kind of a virgin, though,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: Liar. If you have done it before,
dialog: you'll last for thirty seconds.
dialog: Start counting.
text: She opens his fly, then lowers herself down. Allen tries to
text: stop her, but it's too late. He sighs.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: 1...2...
text: Lucien returns and see Allen reluctantly getting his first
text: blowjob. Lucien leans against the books and watches.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: 3...4...
text: Lucien flashes Allen a wicked grin.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: 5...6...
text: Over Gwendolyn's head, Allen watches Lucien staring at him.
text: He starts to get aroused.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: 7...8...9...
text: Allen and Lucien holding eye contact, Allen thrusts into her
text: mouth, comes. Gwendolyn rises back up, unimpressed, drops her
dialog: sweater.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN
dialog: I knew it.
text: She grabs the KEYS that are now back on the shelf. Allen
text: looks to find Lucien. But he is gone.
speaker_heading: GWENDOLYN

text: The light from the boys' flashlights SLICES through the dark
text: as they enter into the library through a heavy door.
text: Bill reaches into Jack's mouth and takes the chewing gum from
text: inside it. Jack shoots a glare at him - what the hell?
text: Bill presses the sticky gum into the strike plate of the door
text: -- blocking the door from being able to close shut.
text: The boys look at each other, give each other the silent nod,
text: then split -- Lucien and Jack sneak off to the main hall,
text: Bill and Allen up to the stacks.
text: Behind them, the chewing gum slips, falls from the strike
text: plate. The door shuts.
text: And LOCKS.
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: INT. STACKS - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. RESTRICTED ACCESS ROOM - NIGHT

text: Lucien at the vitrines which are now wide open and empty.
speaker_heading: JACK

dialog: What just happened?
text: Jack and Lucien grab the books from Allen and start to set

speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD (O.S.)
dialog: We know you're here!
text: The footsteps of the guards approach. Game over. Their work
text: not done, the boys RACE back to the door they came through.
text: All EXCEPT LUCIEN. He ducks behind the vitrine, hiding. He

scene_heading: SECURITY GUARD #2
dialog: Come on out!
text: Across the room, Bill spots TWO GLASS DOORS leading out to a

text: It works. The guards CHASE after the noise.
text: Jack, Bill, Allen BOLT to the glass doors. They throw them

speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Wait. Lucien.
text: Allen turns and sees Lucien, still furiously working, books

text: team-photos, graduations: life in a thousand fake smiles and
dialog: stagings.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Souvenir history. To make people
dialog: think they left some mark on the
dialog: world. Because otherwise nobody
dialog: would ever know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't ever want to end up on this
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Have no fear. You never will.
text: Suddenly, David appears in the bar. The group looks at each
text: other, mystified.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: What's he doing here?
text: David walks briskly over to Lucien.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Since you didn't show up earlier, I
dialog: just hoped to give you this.
dialog: 61.
text: David drops a TERM PAPER on the table: "On the Decline of the
text: West." Allen leans over the table, inserting himself into
dialog: the conversation.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Maybe he didn't want to see you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think he can speak for himself.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Yup. And he says we should all have
dialog: another round...
text: Lucien stands up to get a drink. David grabs his arm. Lucien
text: tries to push him off.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You've had plenty of time to
dialog: celebrate. Your library hijink made
dialog: the morning paper. I'm sure you're
dialog: all very proud.
text: Allen, Jack and Bill glance at each other suspiciously, then
dialog: at David.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: How did you know it was us?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did he use that "Bastille" line?
dialog: Cause I gave it to him.
text: Allen, Jack and Bill look at Lucien, shocked.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: I haven't seen you for days.
text: David throws down Lucien's cravat to the table. The one we
dialog: remember him wearing when we first met him in the library. A
dialog: private power move.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You left this at my place.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: (to David, a guess)
dialog: You told the guards we were there.
dialog: No one else knew.
text: David does not respond. Jack suddenly jolts up. Shoves David
dialog: back.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You little fink!
text: Lucien explodes at David.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You wanted me to get kicked out?!
dialog: You ratted on me!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Stop, Lu. You're losing control
dialog: again. You know what comes next. I
dialog: know what comes next.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (to Lucien)
dialog: Cut him off.
text: Lucien gives David a fatal look.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Best of luck, Janitor.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: We are over. Leave.
text: Lucien spindles the paper and plunges it into a beer. David
text: in shock, begins to shatter in front of them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look at me, Lu.
text: Tears well in David's eyes. Lucien sits back down, ignores
text: him. Bill stands up, tries to lead David away.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (from his wound, breaking)
dialog: You said I was everything to you.
dialog: You are everything to me.
dialog: Everything to me. Do you hear me?
text: David fractures. Utterly vulnerable. This is it: the real
text: uninhibited, uncensored self.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Let's go. Time and place, David.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shut up, traitor.
text: He turns sharply to Lucien saying loud enough so everyone can
dialog: hear.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You'd be dead if it weren't for me!
text: Lucien totally dead cold. Allen, unsure what David is talking
text: about. David turns and rushes outside and Bill follows him.
text: Alone with Allen and Jack, Lucien suddenly smiles as if
text: nothing just happened, puts his arm around Allen.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You'd be boring if it weren't for
dialog: me!
text: The two start to crack up together.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: And...go!
text: Jack crouched inside an empty barrel. Trashed, Lucien kicks
text: the barrel down a grassy slope.
text: Allen and Lucien cheer Jack on as the barrel bangs down the
text: slope. But then it swerves, SLAMS into a bench. At the top of
text: the slope, Lucien and Allen look on in shock.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Jack? Jack?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: He broke his fucking neck. The
text: warrior poet has passed on.
text: Jack staggers from out of the barrel. Throws his hands in the
text: air victoriously. Allen and Lucien cheer him on.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: No, he lives!
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Excellent! Judges award a...
text: Allen holds up nine fingers.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Nine!
dialog: 64.
text: Jack falls to his knees, pukes. Allen and Lucien crack up.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: All right Ginsy, your turn.
text: Drunk, Allen tries to stand up. But then falls right back
text: down. Lucien laughs, tucks his body next to Allen's.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: This is just the beginning, you
dialog: know.
text: Lucien lays his head against Allen's shoulder.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Your fault, Ginsy. It's all your
dialog: fault.
text: Lucien's thigh brushes against Allen's.
text: Allen stares at Lucien, in the full glare of Lucien's warmth.
text: Allen looks around. The park is empty. Building up the
dialog: courage.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: First thought, best thought.
text: He grazes his hand against Lucien's inner thigh. Lucien looks
text: down at Allen's hand curiously, then back at Allen.
text: The decisive moment. Allen leans over. Kisses him. It builds
dialog: in passion.
text: Lucien pulls back, unsure. Then returns the kiss. It builds
dialog: in passion.
text: Everything Allen had hoped for, lensed into a moment.
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: I think I just puked on the inside.
text: Lucien opens his eyes to notice Jack stumbling up the slope.
text: He tenses, pulls away from Allen.
text: The moment has been shattered.
text: As if nothing just happened, Lucien stands and looks at Jack
text: with his usual devilish smile.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Let's go, Jack.
dialog: 65.
text: He throws his arm around Jack's shoulder, turning his back to
text: Allen. They start to walk off. Jack stops, turns back to
dialog: Allen.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wait, Al, you coming?
text: Lucien glares at Allen.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: No. Allen's got work to do. Ten
dialog: pages on Spengler's Decline of the
dialog: West. Due tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: I'd be lost without you, Ginsy.
dialog: (to Jack)
dialog: Come on, Lion.
text: The two of them leave. Allen, abandoned and broken, puts his
text: head in his hands.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Fuck. Fuck!
scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Lucien and Jack stumble into Jack's apartment. Edie sits with
text: GRANDMA FRANKIE (90s, stone-faced) around the living room
text: table, listening to the news on the radio. We hear there's
dialog: been an attack in Anzio.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Edie! Edie bird!
text: Lucien looks at Edie's stone-cold face. She's pissed. He
text: turns right back around.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: (exiting)
dialog: Lu's going to use the loo.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: Say hi to Gram.
text: Grandma Frankie glares at Jack.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: We invited her over for her
dialog: birthday. We made her a cake.
dialog: 66.
text: Jack sees a lumpy, half-eaten cake on the table. Realizing he
dialog: just messed up big-time.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Then we should have a drink! How
dialog: about a drink, Grandma Frankie? You
dialog: want some red wine?
text: Jack heads to the cabinet. Edie follows him.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: Where the hell have you been?!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I was out.
text: Edie's rage boils over.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: I packed all your stuff. It's in
dialog: your bag. I'm going to be at Gram's
dialog: tonight.
text: Jack reaches for her. She shakes him off.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Stay. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: You just say that, but it's one of
dialog: your million words and they don't
dialog: mean anything!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just don't be here when I come back
text: in the morning.
scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET BEDROOM - LATER
text: Edie's gone. The apartment is quiet. Lucien and Jack, crashed
text: out on Jack's bed.
text: The sound of a strange KNOCKING against a window outside.
text: Lucien wakes up. Sees Jack still asleep.
text: He rises to investigate.
scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Lucien sees David, desperate, alone, on the fire escape.
text: Lucien can't believe this. He opens the window.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know this is crazy. I don't know
dialog: even know what I'm doing here. But
dialog: I had to tell you I'm sorry. Let me
dialog: make it up to you.
dialog: From behind...
speaker_heading: JACK (O.S.)
dialog: Lu, where are you?
text: Lucien stares down David.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: I'm going back to bed. Another word
dialog: and I call the police.
text: Lucien turns around and leaves David alone at the sill. From
text: inside the living room, David hears a MEOW.
text: He spots Jack's cat KIT KAT looking up at him.
scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET BEDROOM - LATER
text: The sound of gas and a violent STRUGGLING from the other
dialog: room.
text: Jack quickly wakes up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What the hell?!
text: Jack jumps out of bed and grabs a baseball bat.
scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Jack walks up the hallway. The living room, eerily empty.
text: Then a howling from the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Jack rushes in. Turns on the light. The sounds are coming
speaker_heading: from the OVEN.
text: He rushes to the oven door and opens it. Kit Kat struggles in
text: the oven, gassed and barely alive. Jack turns off the oven,
text: clutches his cat.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: It's okay. Shhh.
dialog: (turns to Lucien)
dialog: 68.
dialog: What kind of sick son of a bitch
dialog: would do something like this?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: It was David.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll wring his fucking neck.
text: LUCIEN's P.O.V.: Jack's Merchant Marine duffel bag that Edie
text: has fully packed for him.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: I have another idea.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - THE NEXT DAY
text: Allen sits at a table at the library he just broke into and
text: robbed. But now he's just another student sitting at a study
dialog: desk.
text: He puts in a blank page in the typewriter before him and
dialog: types: "On The Decline of the West. By..."
text: He hesitates, breaking down in tears.
text: Then finishes typing: "Lucien Carr."
scene_heading: INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY
text: Lucien, in a Merchant Marine uniform, packs his clothes into
text: a sailor's duffel bag. Allen enters, type-written pages in
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Your paper and my apology.
text: Allen hands Lucien the paper he wrote for him. But Lucien
text: doesn't take it. Allen registers that he's packing.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
text: Sailing out. To Paris.
text: Lucien grabs his BOY-SCOUT KNIFE. Puts it in his pocket.
text: Allen is speechless.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: We've got to make a ship, probably
text: as merchant seamen. Jack knows the
dialog: tricks.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You weren't going to tell me?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: We both know why you can't come.
text: Silence. Lucien continues his packing. Allen breaks down.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Fuck you. You're a phony. You got
dialog: me and Jack and Bill making your
dialog: vision come true. All because you
dialog: couldn't do it yourself.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: No, you got what you wanted. You
dialog: were ordinary, just like every
dialog: other freshman, and I made your
dialog: life extraordinary. Go be you now,
dialog: all by yourself. Leave me alone.
text: Allen, now in tears, realizing the end is here.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You don't really mean that.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: (cold, deadened)
dialog: Allen. Leave.
text: Allen gathers himself, stumbles out the door. Leaving the
dialog: friendship behind.
text: Alone, Lucien cracks, breaking down as he closes his
dialog: suitcase.
scene_heading: EXT. SEMINARY COURTYARD - DAY
text: Allen crosses through the courtyard, heading to class. He
text: comes upon David, waiting for Lucien. Pale. Distraught.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Allen, have you seen him? He's not
text: in his room.
text: They look almost the same.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: He left.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I did something wrong. Really
dialog: wrong. And you have no reason to
dialog: help me. But
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: But?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know who you are. We're the ones
dialog: he needs, but never wants. It
dialog: hurts, doesn't it?
text: Allen burns, does not respond. David is right.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All I am asking is tell me where he
dialog: is. Please.
text: CLOSE ON: Allen, on the blade of a choice.
scene_heading: INT. MERCHANT MARINE, BILLETING OFFICE - EVENING
text: Jack and Lucien in a long line of young soldiers waiting to
text: ship out. Lucien nips at a flask. They reach the front of the
text: line. A BILLETING OFFICER calls out to them.
speaker_heading: BILLETING OFFICER
dialog: Lemme see your papers.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
text: Two seamen, reporting for duty.
text: Jack tries not to laugh, hands over his paperwork. The
text: officer points to Lucien.
speaker_heading: BILLETING OFFICER
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Arthur Rimbaud.
text: Jack rolls his eyes. The officer hands the paperwork back.
speaker_heading: BILLETING OFFICER
dialog: Go upstairs to get on the docket.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Let's go get on the docket.
dialog: 71.
text: As they turn to leave, they see David is there, descending
text: the stairs. Jack is about to pounce.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Goddamn son of a bitch!
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Let me handle this.
text: Lucien holds Jack back, rushes up to David.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: How did you know I would be here?!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen, I spoke to a guy upstairs.
dialog: I got two passes. I packed for both
dialog: of us. We can leave.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: The reason I'm leaving is you.
text: It doesn't register. Desperate, David holds out the passes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Then you and Jack take them. I'll
dialog: catch up.
text: Lucien considers this, then makes a fateful decision.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Come with me. We're taking a walk.
scene_heading: INT. TAVERN - NIGHT
text: Allen, wrecked, walks into the bar where he first drank with
dialog: Lucien.
text: He sees an older man eyeing him and sits down, terrified.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Could I have a whiskey, please?
scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Jack unlocks his door. Edie sits on the floor, her eyes red
text: from crying. Jack drops his duffel bag. Sits with her.
speaker_heading: JACK

text: Edie embraces him.
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: INT. TAVERN - NIGHT
text: Allen sees a young man in a Merchant Marine outfit, blond,
text: the bar lamps casting a golden halo around his head. Could it
dialog: be?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Lu?
text: Allen races to him. The man turns and Allen's heart sinks. It
text: is a SAILOR, a distant echo of Lucien.
text: The Sailor eyes Allen gently, seductively.
text: Allen walks up to him.
scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Edie breaks the embrace.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: This came for you today.
text: She hands Jack a package from the mail. A new record.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sammy...
text: Jack places it on the record player and listens, clutching
text: Edie. He knows immediately there won't be another record.
speaker_heading: SAMMY (V.O.)
dialog: Jack, old chum. I'm on a hospital
dialog: ship now. My guts all tore up.
scene_heading: INT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SAMMY (V.O.)
text: I can feel metal under my skin some
dialog: places. Some went clean through.
scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Jack continues to listen to Sammy, his heart sinking. He
dialog: knows this is headed to a dark place.
speaker_heading: SAMMY (V.O.)
dialog: They're not even trying to take it
dialog: out no more.
scene_heading: INT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Bill injects the syrette into his wrist. And presses the

scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT
text: David LUNGES for Lucien and Lucien throws him off, spins

scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT
speaker_heading: SAMMY (V.O.)
dialog: And let thy loud heart keep--

speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: JACK
text: It's Shelley's elegy for Keats.
speaker_heading: EDIE

scene_heading: INT. GROUP SHOWERS, SEMINARY - THE MORNING AFTER

scene_heading: INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY
text: Allen steps out in a bathrobe, to see a POLICEMAN and a

speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: He didn't come back here
text: afterwards. Nobody on the floor
dialog: saw.
text: They stare at Allen, studying him. Other students whisper.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: We have two in custody. We're still
dialog: getting names.
text: Allen makes his way down the hall. Custody? What happened to
dialog: Lucien?
speaker_heading: DETECTIVE
dialog: So what do we know about this Carr

dialog: 76.

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

speaker_heading: EDIE (O.S.)

speaker_heading: ALLEN

scene_heading: INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - DAY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE TOMBS - DAY

text: reading. Allen can't believe he's here.
text: Lucien sits up from his cot and rushes to the bars.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Allen, thank God.
text: Allen's skeptical face makes Lucien change tactics.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: How could you?
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: He wanted to hurt me, I had no
dialog: choice.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: You could have run. Called the
dialog: police.
text: Lucien looks Allen fiercely in the eye.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Listen. Somehow he found me at the
dialog: Marine Hall.
text: Allen looks away, realizing he is potentially complicit.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: He said no matter where I went, he
dialog: would follow. When I confronted
dialog: him, he exploded. I had to defend
dialog: myself. He wouldn't stop.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: But how did Jack and Bill get roped
dialog: into this?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HARLEM SIDEWALK - DAWN
text: Lucien drops the bloody Boy Scout knife down a grate. Jack
dialog: stands guard.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (O.S.)

text: They hear footsteps and turn. A black woman watches them
dialog: suspiciously.
scene_heading: INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (O.S.)

speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. TOMBS - DAY
text: Lucien, desperate, at the bars of his cell.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: The D.A. is asking for my

text: Allen shakes his head, there's no way he's going to do this.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: (pleading)
dialog: We both know I can't do it. I don't
dialog: know what I'm going to do. I'm
dialog: going to be stuck in here for the
dialog: rest of my life!
text: Allen, still unsure. Lucien slides his hand down the bars
text: until it touches Allen's. Pleads seductively.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Please don't leave me here.
text: The BUZZER goes off. Visiting time is over. The prison guard
text: heads towards the cell. Allen makes a fateful choice.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I'll do it.
text: Lucien, smiling. Leans in, whispers.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: We're going to say it was an "honor
dialog: slaying".

scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY

dialog: 79.
text: OTHER students around Allen gossip and steal glances at him

speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: "If the accused is heterosexual, he
dialog: shall be pardoned. But if the

dialog: of murder in the first degree..."
text: Allen's attention falls to the final words:
text: "SHALL STAND."
scene_heading: INT. POLICE OFFICE - DAY
text: Jack, in handcuffs, on the phone. PHOTOGRAPHERS, JOURNALISTS
text: outside, clamoring for Jack to look their way. A murder with

dialog: appeared out of thin air. So I sent
dialog: Lu to Chicago.
text: Allen registers the reference from Lucien's conversation with
text: the Dean, a dim clue. Marion goes back to packing.
speaker_heading: MARION CARR
dialog: Surprise, David turned up there
dialog: too. Then, when Lucien wanted to go
dialog: to Mexico, guess who had a car
text: idling in the driveway?
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: But he didn't have to go with him.
speaker_heading: MARION CARR
dialog: He spun a web to ensnare my son.
dialog: That's why I brought him here. A
dialog: lot of good that did.
text: Marion finds Lucien's cravat, quickly folds it, hides it in
text: the suitcase. Allen notices.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: What happened in Chicago?
text: Marion stops packing. Thinks. She settles on the bed, charms
text: Allen with a smile.
speaker_heading: MARION CARR
dialog: Thank God Lu has you in his life.
dialog: He talks about you all the time.
text: She leans over and slips the cigarette from Allen's hands
text: into her own. Inhales seductively.
speaker_heading: MARION CARR
dialog: You know what Allen? He calls you
dialog: his guardian angel.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: That's what he called David.
text: She exhales, her face falls. Leans in threateningly.
speaker_heading: MARION CARR
dialog: That man ruined my son. You're
dialog: going to help me keep what's left
dialog: of him.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. BURROUGHS'S APARTMENT (69 BEDFORD) - NIGHT
text: The zip of a suitcase. Bill, undoing his den, packing away
text: clothes, books. He's also leaving town. Allen's come for
text: answers --- from the only person who knew the real David.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Contrary to reports, prison is not
dialog: a tonic for the spirit.
dialog: We are now realizing it's the end of a chapter for all of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: All the district attorney cared
dialog: about was if David was queer.
text: Allen gulps. The heart of the issue, thrust into the light.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: And what did you tell them?
text: Bill sees the box of morphine from his night with Norman. He
text: decides to take it with him, hides it under a pile of shirts.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I said yes.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Did David do something Lu in
dialog: Chicago?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Christ Allen, please don't get
dialog: involved.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I have to be. I'm helping him write
dialog: his defense.
text: Bill paces, then turns to face Allen.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: David was my friend. But he's dead.
dialog: And did Lucien tell you how he
dialog: died?
text: Allen shakes his head. He has no idea.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
dialog: The moment right after Lucien stabbed David. What we have not
text: seen yet. The story continues.
text: David trembles on the ground, bleeding from the knife would.
text: Lucien stands above, realizing what just happened.
text: Car headlamps swipe across Lucien's face. Terrified, Lucien
text: scans the park for witnesses.
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: He might not have wanted you to
dialog: know, Allen. He tied David up.
text: Lucien DRAGS David's body from the park under a railing to
dialog: the shoreline.
text: He unties his shoes, LASHES David's hands together with the
text: shoelaces. Ties them tight.
text: David groans and gurgles blood. Still very much ALIVE.
text: Lucien rustles through David's pockets -- pulls out anything
text: side. He tosses David's pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes, now
text: speckled with blood - to the sand.
text: Lucien collects stones from the riverbank, STUFFS them into
text: David's pockets.
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
text: He put stones in his pockets to
text: weigh him down.
text: Lucien panics, looks around. He takes off his Merchant Marine
text: clothes. Fully naked, he drags a bound David into the dark
text: waters of the Hudson River.
text: David moans and struggles but is no match for Lucien.
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: And dragged him into the Hudson
dialog: River.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (O.S.)
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: BILL (O.S.)
dialog: David was alive, Allen, until
dialog: Lucien made him drown.
text: The sound of a door slamming open brings us...

scene_heading: INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: MR. BURROUGHS (60s, patrician, wealthy), Bill's father enters

text: Mr. Burroughs eyes Allen suspiciously.
speaker_heading: MR. BURROUGHS
dialog: Who are you? Is he part of this
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Leave him alone, Dad.
speaker_heading: MR. BURROUGHS
dialog: I paid your bail. Don't talk to me
dialog: like that.
text: Bill looks down, obedient. The rebel silenced by his father.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. BURROUGHS
text: The car leaves in five minutes.
text: As Mr. Burroughs exits, Bill furiously SLAMS his suitcase
dialog: closed.
speaker_heading: BILL
text: The libertine circle has come to an
dialog: end.
text: Allen looks at Bill, lost at what to do next. Bill leans in
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Go back to the beginning.
text: THE RED LINE LEADS US, ONCE MORE, DOWN THE SUBWAY MAP FROM
text: COLUMBIA...
text: TO THE EDGE OF THE WORLD. WHERE IT ALL STARTED.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY
text: The window bangs open. Allen climbs into David's apartment
text: from the fire-escape.
text: He opens the door to the living room. Sunlight filtering into
text: a dusty, silent apartment.
dialog: 84.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY
text: It is eerie. The place of someone who just left the world.
text: Allen looks around, unsure what he's looking for.
text: His eyes fall on the bookshelves. Memories flood back,
text: raveling and unraveling.
scene_heading: FLASHCUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY
text: Books LEAP into Bill's hands and he places them back on the

dialog: original condition.
text: Lucien TAP nails out of the wall handing the pages back to
dialog: Allen.
text: Allen scouring his memories, just like when he wrote his poem
dialog: earlier.
text: Time runs in reverse.
text: BACK TO SCENE
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY
text: Allen searches through the steamer trunk of the apartment.
text: Nothing. He ruffles through the console table. Again nothing.
text: He notices David's SUITCASE. The one David packed before
text: planning on leaving by boat with Lucien.
text: Allen opens it. He digs through it, searching for some clue,
text: any clue -- something to shed light on the past.
text: He pulls out a pile of clothes and underneath them...a book.
text: It's a copy of Yeats' A VISION, covered in notes. It's
dialog: David's.
dialog: It's the same edition of the copy that Lucien showed Allen in
dialog: his room.
scene_heading: FLASHCUT TO:
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - NIGHT
text: Time shifts into reverse -- we realize this Allen's mind at
text: work: rummaging for details, clues, snatches of life.
text: We see the first night Allen met David -- David circling his
text: finger around his wineglass, his speech about life as a
text: circle,slipping through time...
scene_heading: FLASHCUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY
text: Allen opening the book to find the legend that Lucien once
text: showed him, the picture of Yeats's WHEEL.
text: A stack of PAPERS fall from the book. Allen rifles through
dialog: them.
text: And finds a faded pink hospital "ADMIT" form.
dialog: Cook County Hospital, Chicago. March 1943.
text: He scans down the page: "Carr, Lucien. Suicide Attempt. Gas
dialog: Inhalation. Admitting Person: D. Kammerer."
text: At the bottom, the form reads "Next of Kin."
dialog: Beside is the name: David Kammerer.
text: Below, Allen sees POSTCARDS, PHOTOS. Photos of the beach, of
text: Lucien and David, reclining together. It's their trip to
dialog: Mexico.
text: In photo, the two of them, posing for the camera together.
text: Smiling. Looking very much like a couple in love.
text: Lucien's signature red CRAVAT hangs around David's neck.
text: On the backside, written by hand is:
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (V.O.)
dialog: The perfect day.
text: Allen, shocked. The puzzle pieces have fallen into place.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY, GREYSTONE - DAY
text: INSERT: A photo of Lucien in The New York Times.
dialog: 86.
text: The headline: "STUDENT IS SILENT ON SLAYING FRIEND. HELD
scene_heading: WITHOUT BAIL. AWAITING DEPOSITION."
text: The sound of footsteps.
text: Allen looks over the article. He's on a bench in the hallway
text: of an old sanitarium.
text: His mother, Naomi, approaches, tentatively. The first time
text: they have seen each other since she was taken from home.
text: Both of them scared to make the first move towards re-
dialog: connection.
text: Naomi steps towards her son, takes his face in her hands.
text: Allen melts in her arms.
scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN, GREYSTONE - DAY
text: Allen and Naomi, in the courtyard of the hospital. Patients
text: being led through the sanitarium's gardens by nurses behind.
text: Naomi, looks remarkably more calm then the last time Allen
dialog: saw her.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: He would leave me alone in the
dialog: house. I was going to die there.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: No, Mom. That's not true.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Yeah, I know it.
text: Naomi sinks inside herself, dark thoughts returning.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Mom, stop.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Hey, I'm okay now. I'm your mother.
dialog: And I'm okay.
text: She notices the bags under his eyes. His weary face.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: But you're not.
text: Allen, a kid out of his league.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I'm in over my head. Someone I know
dialog: killed a man. And I don't know what
dialog: to do. He wants my help. And I
dialog: don't know if I should give it to
dialog: him. I don't know if it's right.
dialog: It's just a mess.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Let him go. Don't help him.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: I can't, mom. He's my best friend.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Listen to me.
text: Naomi pulls her son closer. With more strength than she has
dialog: displayed in years.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: The most important thing your
dialog: father ever did was fail me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You understand?
text: Allen, realizing what he has to do.
scene_heading: INT. DORMROOM - NIGHT
text: Late night. Allen, back at the typewriter where he wrote the
dialog: poem for Lucien.

text: The events of the night in question -- the night of David's
text: murder -- ravels and unravels in his mind's eye.
scene_heading: FLASHCUT TO:
text: David, stabbed, gasping at Lucien with horror. The knife
text: being pulled back, the wound closing back up.
scene_heading: FLASHCUT TO:
text: David, reaching for Lucien, in reverse, Lucien walking back

speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)

dialog: once--
scene_heading: FLASHCUT TO:
dialog: 88.
text: Allen turns over the old PHOTOGRAPH of David and Lucien
text: together from David's apartment. The Perfect Day.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: You loved him back.
scene_heading: FLASHCUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: Time now runs forward, to the inevitable. We watch Lucien and
text: David walking once more of the night of the murder. But this
text: time we hear their argument. Lucien, drunk, tosses his flask
text: into the bushes. David follows him, desperate.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let's get out of the city. Anywhere
dialog: you want. I've saved up.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: But this secret ate away at you.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: I was just a kid, you dragged me
dialog: into your perverted mess!
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: So in Chicago, you tried to kill
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How can you say that? You know
dialog: that's not true.
text: Lucien stops short. Stares hard at David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I will never give up on us.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: He rescued you. He saved your life.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You're pathetic.
text: Lucien walks on, but David lunges for him. They struggle.
text: Lucien throws David off, spins free from his grasp, pulls out
text: his Boy Scout knife from his pocket.
text: The two men face each other.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: You needed him as much as he needed
dialog: you.
text: The bare blade FLASHES between them. David, looking at the
text: knife, shocked that their relationship has come to this. He
text: looks back up at Lucien.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now I know how you felt.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: When you wanted to die.
text: David takes a step, closing the gap between him and the
text: knife. Daring Lucien to strike.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do it.
text: Lucien moves forward. The gap narrows. Just inches away from
dialog: each other.
text: David steps forward onto the blade. Lucien does not back off.
text: David gasps, notices the knife deep in his chest to the hilt.
text: Blood pumps from the gash.
text: Lucien frees the knife. Then pulls back and STABS David a
text: second time. With malice.
text: And again. Plunges the blade into his chest. He grinds the
text: knife into David even further..
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh my god...
text: David DROPS, clutching his shirt, his life pulsing from his
dialog: chest.
scene_heading: FLASHCUT TO:

text: The opening shot of the film.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: And if you try to let them go...
text: David's eyes CLOSE. Lucien releases David out into the
dialog: current.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
text: ...they only circle back and return
dialog: to you.
text: David sinks into the depths of the Hudson, becoming just a
text: shadow then disappearing altogether.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: They become part of who you are.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE TOMBS - DAY
text: From his cell, Lucien Carr finishes reading Allen's
scene_heading: DEPOSITION.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Or they destroy you.
text: We have returned to the opening scene of the movie. Lucien
text: crumples the paper in his hand.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You can't show this to anyone.
text: Allen stares at Lucien defiantly through the bars.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Then tell the truth, Lu.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You weren't even there. It's your
dialog: truth. It's fiction.
dialog: 91.
text: Allen grabs for the manuscript. Lucien pulls it out of reach.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: You wanted him gone too. You sent
dialog: him to me.
text: Allen SNATCHES the manuscript -- it's a tug of war through
dialog: the bars.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Please. You'll kill me with that.
text: Allen yanks the paper from Lucien's grip. He heads towards
text: the exit of the prison. Desperate, Lucien calls out after
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: LUCIEN
dialog: Allen! No! DON'T!
text: An alarm HAMMERS through the prison, sending us to...
scene_heading: INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The New York City's District Attorney's SECRETARY at her

speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Allen Ginsberg.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: He'll be with you in a minute.
dialog: Please, have a seat.
text: Allen waits, glances at the deposition in his lap. The title
text: reads, "The Night in Question."
scene_heading: INT. JAIL - DAY
text: From his prison bed, Lucien stares down the cellblock,
text: hopeless. His eyes alight on his sheets.
scene_heading: INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The camera moves in an arc, rotating past Allen, sweating,
text: toward the door of the DISTRICT ATTORNEY...
dialog: 92.
scene_heading: INT. JAIL - DAY
text: ...the same circle finds Lucien as he RIPS the bedsheet into
dialog: strips. Frantic...
scene_heading: INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The circle discovers Allen, unable to sit still. The weight
dialog: of his decision crushes him...
scene_heading: INT. JAIL - DAY
text: ...Lucien fashions a noose around his neck. He ties the sheet
text: to one of the cell bars. We glide past him back to...
scene_heading: INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: ...Allen spies the shadow of the District Attorney behind
text: frosted glass of his office...
scene_heading: INT. JAIL - DAY
text: ...the circling suddenly STOPS at Lucien as the knot on the
text: noose catches. He is hanging, choking, desperate to die and
text: yet fighting for life.
text: But the knot on the cell bars releases. Lucien FALLS to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: Alive.
scene_heading: INT. DISTRICT'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
text: The secretary hangs up the phone.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Mr. Ginsberg. He's ready for you.

speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Mr. Ginsberg?

dialog: 93.
scene_heading: INT. COLUMBIA DEAN'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Allen's manuscript HITS the Dean's desk.
text: The deposition's title page now reads "The Night in Question

text: Allen sits in the same chair where Lucien was reprimanded.
text: Professor Steeves sits silently beside the Dean at his desk.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: No, please tell me. Professor
dialog: Steeves says you submitted it as
dialog: your final.
text: Allen, nervous in the chair.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well, then, let me tell you. It is
text: smutty and absurd.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: But you finished it.
text: The Dean loses his patience.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You've taken incompletes in two
dialog: classes. And you are already on
dialog: academic probation. There are rules
dialog: you agreed to upon admittance into
dialog: this university. And you have
dialog: managed to break and keep breaking
dialog: them. You don't seem to have much
dialog: respect for this institution. So
dialog: you may either retract this fiction
dialog: as your final. Or you may choose to
dialog: be expelled. What will it be?
text: Professor Steeves eyes Allen.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Fine.
text: Allen stands, making his decision.
speaker_heading: ALLEN
dialog: Consider me expelled.

text: Professor Steeves keeps a close eye on Allen as he leaves the
dialog: office.
scene_heading: INT. GINSBERG HOME - DAY
text: Back in the Ginsberg residence, but the house is quiet now,
text: peaceful. No Naomi. The radio playing softly in the living

text: Allen, shirt untucked, composing a poem on the back of a
dialog: bill.
text: They both reach for their cigarettes at the same time.
text: Louis looks at Allen writing. A mirror between father and
text: son. A moment of warm appreciation.
text: Louis hands Allen a package from the mail pile.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: This came for you today.
text: The package is from Columbia University. Allen opens it,
text: mystified as to what it might be.
dialog: It's his manuscript.
text: On it, a note: "Walt Jr.: Keep this, Keep Going. - Professor
dialog: Steeves."
text: The music on the radio suddenly stops for a news broadcast.

text: Allen closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
text: The circle is broken.
scene_heading: INT. WEST END BAR - DAY
text: A raucous crowd now fills the boys' old haunt. Soldiers, New
text: Yorkers of all kinds, pouring champagne, toasting the end of
dialog: the Second World War.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
text: But with death comes rebirth.
text: The camera searches through the crowd to find Allen smoking
text: in a banquette towards the rear of the bar, dressed-down,
text: scruffy - a hint of the man he will soon become.
text: He is joyous, writing in his journal.
speaker_heading: ALLEN (V.O.)
dialog: And like all lovers and sad people
text: The camera then pans past Allen, up and across the old
text: college photos on the wall.
text: We find a framed newspaper article on the Columbia's football
dialog: team's latest victory.
text: In the corner of the article, we see a familiar face.
