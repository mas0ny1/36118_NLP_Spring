scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL —- AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 1
text: A chamber orchestra is performing Mozart's Piano Concerto No.
text: 23 (2nd movement), featuring soloist, MARIA YUDINA.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 2
text: A small room looking into the hall. The programme director,
text: ANDREYEV (45) leans back in his chair. Eyes closed, he
text: “conducts” the music with a cheap fountain pen.
text: A technician, SERGEI, keeps an eye on dials and buttons.
text: There's a clock and a portrait of Stalin on the wall.
text: The phone rings. Grudgingly, Andreyev answers.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: (snappy )
dialog: Radio Moscow. Director Andreyev.
dialog: What is it?
text: He suddenly tenses, gesturing at the technician to turn down
text: the music. Sergei watches him, munching on an apple.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV (CONT'D)
dialog: 17 minutes?.....
text: He gropes manically for a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV (CONT'D)
dialog: 5..eleeeee
text: The pen doesn't work. He shakes it - no good.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV (CONT'D)
dialog: (he's not)
dialog: .-Yes, I'm writing it down..
text: He smacks the apple out of Sergei’s hand and gets him to hand
text: over a pencil.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV (CONT'D)
dialog: -- 9?.. Was it a 9, like 'fine' or
dialog: a 5 like....
dialog: (gestures to Sergei)
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: --hive?
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: Hello?... Hello?
text: They've gone. He hangs up. He's in a state.
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: Who was it?

text: Sergei turns away. He's not getting involved.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: I'm to ring back in exactly 17
text: minutes. 17 minutes from the start
dialog: or the end? How long did I talk
dialog: for? HOW LONG?
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL —- AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 3
text: Some of the audience are lost in the music. A NERVOUS MAN
text: glances at an NKVD GUARD looking at him.
text: Trying to hide his panic, the nervous man looks away then
text: back to the guard... who waves coyly. A woman sat next to him
text: waves back. The nervous man heaves a sigh of relief.
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE/DINING ROOM - NIGHT 4
text: We're on a large portrait of Stalin: handsome, strong, sleek
text: dark hair. We pan down to see the real STALIN - frail, old,
text: grey hair - at his desk. His frail fingers search through
text: lists of names as the Mozart concerto plays on his radio.
text: Humble decor: a few chairs, a desk, a small bed.
text: A short, stocky man with cold eyes behind a set of pince-nez
text: stands on the other side of the desk. This is BERIA.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I put Shteyman on the list. The
dialog: writer. I know you like his stuff,
dialog: but...
text: Stalin thinks for a moment, then shakes his head.
speaker_heading: STALIN
dialog: No. Keep him on.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: (points at the next name)
dialog: Shteyman 2, his wife.
text: Stalin gives a tiny shrug meaning ‘yes.’
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 3.
speaker_heading: BERIA (CONT'D)
dialog: And Shteyman 3. His brother.
speaker_heading: STALIN
dialog: On. Better to be sure.
text: Beyond Beria, through a doorway, a bulky, balding middle-aged
text: man - KHRUSHCHEV, 59 - is entertaining two other bulky men:
scene_heading: MALENKOV - 57, - and MOLOTOV - 70.
text: Khrushchev is miming an amusing war incident; people ina
text: panic not knowing what to do with a live grenade.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: .-they were all jumping around like
dialog: drunken whores..
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM/DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 5
text: From the auditorium, we see the window of the director's
text: office with the figure of Andreyev pacing in frustration.
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE/DINING ROOM - NIGHT 6
text: Khrushchev is miming a man with a grenade in his mouth.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: He had this look like:
dialog: (muffled)
dialog: ‘There’s a grenade in my mouth'.
text: Stalin signs the lists and hands them to Beria.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I'll have these dispatched.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 7
text: Andreyev stares at the clock. Time has passed; the music has
dialog: moved on to a new movement.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: “It is the greatest honour...’
dialog: (he bows)
dialog: He can’t see me bow, idiot.
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: Er, Comrade Director?
text: It's 10.27. Andreyev rushes for the phone, banging his hip
text: painfully on the table. He grabs the phone and dials. The
text: music finishes and we hear applause. He gestures frantically
text: to the technician to turn the loudspeaker off.
text: Someone answers the phone.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 4.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: Hello?... YES.
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - NIGHT 8
text: Stalin is on the phone, with the applause playing on the
text: radio and the others laughing drunkenly in the other room.
speaker_heading: STALIN
dialog: This is Stalin.
text: In the background, Khrushchev is continuing his story.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: So I said “You'll have to
dialog: enunciate”. Then-
text: He mimes the grenade going off, to uproarious laughter.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 9
text: The applause is loud. Andreyev rushes to a cupboard.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: (stammering)
dialog: Comrade... General... How are
dialog: things? Sorry... Hold on...
text: He gets in the cupboard. The phone cord only just reaches.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry again...
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - NIGHT 10
speaker_heading: STALIN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I want a recording of tonight's
dialog: performance. I'll send someone to
dialog: pick it up.
text: Stalin hangs up. He notices that one sheet of the list of
text: names has been left behind. Beria comes back in.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: (picking up sheet)
dialog: Ah. Don’t want them to miss the
dialog: party, do we?
text: He heads back out.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 5.
scene_heading: EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING - NIGHT 11
text: Beria divides the lists between some SENIOR NKVD OFFICERS,
speaker_heading: including DELOV.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: (pointing to the list)
dialog: Shoot her before him but make sure
dialog: he sees it. And this one. Kill him,
dialog: take him to his church, dump him in
dialog: the pulpit.
text: He's pleased with the idea. He heads back to the dacha.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - DIRECTOR’S OFFICE/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 12
text: Some MUSICIANS sweep into the Director’s office, others are
text: at the entrance out into the corridor.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN 1
dialog: .--she said “I only wear them at
dialog: the weekend”!
text: Laughter. Surprise as Andreyev steps out of the cupboard.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: Was the concerto recorded?
dialog: Was it recorded?! Say “yes” to me.
speaker_heading: SERGEI
dialog: Um... No.
text: Andreyev can barely breathe.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: Stop them leaving!
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 13
text: Andreyev storms along corridor and down some stairs.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: Break their legs. Not that, but
dialog: anything else.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - FOYER - NIGHT 14
text: Andreyev reaches the foyer and fights against the flowing
text: crowd and in to the hall were some musicians are packing up.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: Encore! Encore the whole bloody
dialog: thing! Don’t test me, you fucking
dialog: idiots. Sorry. You're very
dialog: talented. But please go back on.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 6.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL —- AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 15
text: The audience are leaving, among them the NERVOUS MAN. He's
text: keeping his eye on the NKVD man by the exit.
text: Andreyev rushes to the stage, and bangs a cymbal with a
text: flute, knocking aside music stands to get to the front.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: (to Security)
dialog: Lock the doors! Lock the doors!
dialog: (to everyone else)
dialog: Don't worry, no-one is going to get
dialog: killed. But I do need you to stay!
text: Everyone - musicians, audience - look at him. The nervous man
text: is sweating, terrified. Security guards block the doors. The
text: NKVD man remains inside.
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 16
text: A sparsely furnished dining room after a long night of
text: drinking and eating. Stalin is just sitting down at one end,
text: filling his pipe with crumbled cigarette tobacco. Malenkov
text: tops up everyone's glass.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: You know, you put someone’s little
text: finger in a glass of water when
dialog: they’re asleep? They wet
dialog: themselves.
speaker_heading: STALIN
dialog: What next? Place a bar of chocolate
dialog: in their pocket, they’1l shit their
dialog: pants?
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: It’s biology, chief. We did it to
dialog: Polnikov in Stalingrad.
text: Beria joins them, picking up a tomato from the table.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Potato doing his war stories again?
text: (looking at his watch,
dialog: then to Molotov)
dialog: WELL before midnight. Pay up.
text: Molotov gets out some cash. They've clearly had a bet.
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
dialog: You're bankrupting me, Nikita. This
dialog: is a capitalist conspiracy.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 7.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: What became of that old dog
dialog: Polnikov?
speaker_heading: STALIN
dialog: You want to know where fucking
dialog: Polnikov is? You want to GO there?
dialog: Malenkov knows he shouldn't have asked.
text: Beria puts his arm round Khrushchev.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I love that grenade story. Oh, is
dialog: there one in your pocket?
text: Khrushchev pulls a squashed tomato from his pocket. Beria and
text: the others laugh. Stalin too.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (laughs, camping it up)
dialog: I die for the Motherland!
text: MUSIC: dramatic orchestral.
text: Under the music, everything slows down.
text: In slow motion, we see Khrushchev and Beria laughing at each
text: other, like two braying animals. Khrushchev tries to wipe his
text: hand on Beria's jacket, generating more laughter. We can just
text: hear, at a quarter of the speed, Beria and Khrushchev calling
text: each other 'Potato' and 'Tomato' but it sounds like grunts.
text: We see under Beria, the caption "Lavrenti BERIA. Head of
text: Security Forces". And under Khrushchev, his caption: "Nikita
text: KHRUSHCHEV, in charge of Agricultural Reform".
dialog: MUSIC OUT - Back to normal speed.
text: Malenkov takes another tomato from the table, desperate to be
text: in on the joke.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Take THIS, you bastards!
text: He mimes pulling a grenade pin from it with his teeth. Now
text: doesn’t know where to take the joke. Puts the tomato down.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV (CONT’D)
dialog: Anyway...better get back to...
speaker_heading: STALIN
dialog: Time for a cowboy movie. Who’s in
dialog: my posse?
text: Everyone tries to look excited.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 8.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Oh good, it's Stagecoach again.
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
dialog: Yee-hah!
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 17
text: The orchestra are on stage. Half the audience remain.
text: Security guards are at each door. Andreyev at the front of
text: the stage. Maria is nearby at the piano.
speaker_heading: SERGEI
text: Half the audience have gone. The
dialog: acoustic will be very dry.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: Pull people in off the streets! Fat
dialog: ones, so we won’t need so many!
text: MUSICIAN 1, the orchestra’s joker, asserts himself.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN 1
dialog: I could call my wife? She'd...
dialog: (indicates “fat”)
dialog: .-."dampen the acoustic”.
text: Laughter. Andreyev turns to the audience, trying to smile.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: Comrades!
text: A TRUMPETER plays a quick fanfare, prompting laughter.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV (CONT'D)
dialog: Comrades, shut up! I have great
dialog: news! Wonderful news.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN 1
dialog: (to Andreyev)
dialog: Are you pregnant?
text: The trumpeter parps. More laughter.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: Comrade Stalin...
dialog: (shoots a look)
dialog: ..-loved tonight's concerto and
dialog: would like a recording of it right
dialog: away which we don't have for some
dialog: reason and trust me we will look
dialog: into why that happened, but
dialog: meanwhile... the concerto we just
dialog: played will be played by us

text: record it and applaud it.
dialog: 18
dialog: 19
dialog: 20
dialog: 21
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 9.
text: No smiling now. Some of the musicians start clapping, then
text: the audience, security guards, a very relieved nervous man,
dialog: everyone. It's a huge standing ovation, though you can just
text: make out someone dry-heaving. When it dies we hear Maria...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I'm not going to do it.
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN 1
dialog: You cow hole bitch.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOSCOW STREETS/INT. CAR - NIGHT 18
text: The cars from Stalin's dacha fanning out from the main car

text: We stay with one car as it passes several black military-

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOSCOW STREETS - NIGHT 19

text: at one window.
scene_heading: INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM/DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 21
text: Andreyev hurries Maria up the concert hall and into his
text: office. The conductor follows them in. Through the office
text: window, we can see the orchestra and audience watching.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: You, Joan of Arc, you want to get
dialog: killed?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Oh, like my father “got killed”? My
dialog: brother? Like THAT?
text: He sits her down in a chair.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 10.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: You want a family reunion in the
dialog: mortuary?!
text: The Conductor is in the background looking unwell.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I won't do it. You can't force me.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: (to the conductor)
dialog: Should we get another pianist?
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: No, that's ridiculous. The sound
dialog: would be entirely different. Even
dialog: Stalin could...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: “Even”.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: (frozen in fear)
dialog: No... I meant...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Even STALIN? Is this office bugged?
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: (trying to help out)
dialog: Of course Comrade Stalin will be
dialog: able to tell the difference. He's a
dialog: great man, with a great ear for
dialog: music.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Two great ears.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: The two greatest ears in the Soviet
dialog: Union.
text: Andreyev comes close to Maria, takes her hands, pleading.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV (CONT'D)
dialog: Maria Viniaminovna...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (of her fingers)
dialog: Don’t crush the little workers.

speaker_heading: MARIA

dialog: So you said it then.
dialog: (to Andreyev)
dialog: As God is my witness, I won't do

speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
text: 10000 roubles.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: 20000.
speaker_heading: ANDREYEV
dialog: Done.
text: Andreyev hurries Maria out into the corridor, followed by the

speaker_heading: ANDREYEV (CONT'D)
dialog: Who put that there? What brainless
dialog: fucking fire safety FUCKER put that
dialog: there?
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - DINING ROOM/OFFICE - NIGHT 22
text: It's dark. Khrushchev, Beria, Malenkov and Molotov are
text: watching a John Wayne western.
text: Beyond them, Stalin stands by his desk, looking at papers.
text: Molotov has fallen asleep, with Malenkov next to him.
speaker_heading: BERIA
text: He gets shot off his horse.
dialog: (guy gets shot off horse)
dialog: Yup. Adios.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (loudly, so Stalin hears)
dialog: Horses are shit, son! You should
text: have commandeered a tank.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: You know we produced 5000 T-64
dialog: tanks last year?
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: If I have to watch this fucking

dialog: head.
dialog: 20 May 2016

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I can have that arranged. Ach,

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Anyone we know on the list?
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: (admonishing)
dialog: Hey, we’re supposed to be watching
dialog: Shitcoach.
text: They look up to see if Stalin is listening.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (quieter)
dialog: Any good ones?
speaker_heading: BERIA
text: One of his guards. Says his wife
dialog: gave him some slippers to wear so
dialog: he wouldn't make any noise. The old
dialog: man’s convinced it’s so he can
text: creep up on him in his sleep and
dialog: kill him.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Where will it end? Are we arresting
dialog: anyone with feet?
text: Malenkov laughs.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Nikita. I’m having a man shot for
dialog: “acquiring slippers”. Never joke
dialog: about something so serious.
text: Stalin comes towards them.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: (loudly, to alert Molotov)
dialog: Ah, you're just in time for the Red
dialog: Indian attack.
text: He does a loud, clumsy hand-over-mouth war cry.
text: Molotov wakes and panics.
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
dialog: He.. the horse.. I was.. thinking..
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: You were asleep.
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
text: No. Focussed... on the soundtrack.

dialog: 24
dialog: 25
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 13.
text: He yawns, and we go into slow motion again.
text: Dramatic MUSIC Again.
text: Under Molotov, the caption: "Vyacheslav MOLOTOV. Foreign
dialog: Secretary".
text: Under Malenkov, laughing, is "Georgy MALENKOV. Deputy General
dialog: Secretary".
dialog: Back to normal speed.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: (to Molotov)
dialog: You'll soon have plenty of time to
dialog: sleep, comrade.

text: Mrs Bresnavich goes to the window and sees A MAN being led

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: You're Acting General Secretary.
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: (round the other side)
dialog: Can't be any heavier than my

text: Khrushchev grabs Stalin's feet. There's now too many on the

speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: Mikoyan!
text: He gestures for Mikoyan to go to the other side. Grudgingly,

speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Better. More balanced.
text: Malenkov doing some light stretches.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: I have back trouble. The head's the

speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: I think actually it’s the stomach
dialog: and the, you know...
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: Tackle?
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Arse.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Can we stop haggling like a market
dialog: full of fishwives and do this!
text: Malenkov joins the others. Khrushchev pushes Mikoyan to the

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BULGANIN

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: You think Stalin is...”too heavy”?
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: It’s a compliment. Gold’s heavy.
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: You'd know. You looted enough of

dialog: (winks at Bulganin)
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Now we're all cosy and quorate, I

speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
text: The best doctors are in the gulag.

speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: What are people’s thoughts on

speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: What if he recovers and finds out?
text: Khrushchev stops so they all have to. He unconsciously
text: gestures with Stalin's feet as he talks.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: If he recovers, then we used a good
dialog: doctor. If he doesn’t recover, then
dialog: we didn’t but he won’t know. But if
dialog: we don’t get a doctor...
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 32.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV

speaker_heading: MIKOYAN

speaker_heading: MALENKOV

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Yes. Are you still in touch?
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Well, we don’t go skating together.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: We could get her in.
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: (really?)
dialog: She sounds a keen helper, but... a

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: She's got everything we need for

speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: Well, she’s got my vote.
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Yes. Let her find us some doctors.
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: If it ends badly, we pin it all on

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: And we shoot her.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: That would work.

speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Let’s be careful! He’s not a sack

speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: Mind the...! Achtung, achtung!

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV

speaker_heading: BERIA

speaker_heading: BERIA

speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: What about Svetlana and Vasily?
dialog: They'll want to see their father.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: No. I don’t want them contacted

speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: Really? I heard Mikoyan. God he was

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D)
dialog: So. Who'll be on the next list?
dialog: (indicates “me and you”)
speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: Look, nobody wants the future of

dialog: Reform. Change. We really want

dialog: We should sound out Mikoyan and...

dialog: Khrushchev. Talking goat. Don’t

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: You call it “Mother Russia”?

speaker_heading: TARASOV

speaker_heading: VASILY
dialog: That plane should never have taken

speaker_heading: TARASOV
dialog: Has something happened to our

speaker_heading: VASILY
dialog: No.
dialog: (indicates rink)
dialog: See? No. But ask yourself - might

dialog: You have your orders.
text: He turns and goes back inside.
scene_heading: INT./EXT - VASILY'S LIMOUSINE - DAY 78
text: Vasily's limo drives through the countryside.
text: Vasily sits between the NKVD officers in the back, drinking.
text: No-one says anything. Then...
speaker_heading: VASILY
dialog: Do either of you play hockey?
scene_heading: INT. KREMLIN - STALIN'S OFFICE - DAY 79
text: The room is big and spartan. Simple furniture, wall maps. An
text: outsized chess set. The lights are on.
text: The locked door CRACKS as an NKVD OFFICER forces entry. A
text: SENIOR NKVD OFFICER enters, switches off the light.
scene_heading: EXT. RED SQUARE - DAY 80
text: From across the square, we see the light go out.
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - OFFICE - DAY 81
text: KHRUSHCHEV steps in. It's dark; the curtains are shut.
text: He checks the safe: it's locked. He looks on the desk, opens
text: a couple of drawers.
speaker_heading: SVETLANA (0.S.)
dialog: I have every right to be here!
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 46.
text: Khrushchev jumps. He didn't see Svetlana sat in the darkness.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (Thinking of an excuse)
dialog: Your father kept some excellent
dialog: vodka here.
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: And Vasily probably drank it. Oh,
dialog: Nikita. Who can I turn to now? Mama
dialog: killed herself, Papa’s dying,
dialog: Vasily’s...
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Yes! I was also looking for you to
dialog: tell you that I’ve sent for Vasily!
text: He's not sure whether to put a comforting hand on her or not.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm here. No matter what happens,
dialog: I'll make sure no harm comes to you
dialog: or your brother.
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: Who said anything about harm? Did
dialog: someone tell you we’re in danger?
dialog: Tell me!
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: I didn't mean...
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: (panicky/angry)
dialog: Who wishes harm on me?
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Nobody. Nobody. Anyway, they’d have
dialog: to get past ME.
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: People would harm the children of
dialog: Stalin? Even though he’s...
text: She loses it. A gush of tears. Khrushchev hesitates, settles
text: for an awkward, comradely grip on her shoulders.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Your father can never die. Stalin
dialog: is you, Stalin is me, Stalin is the
dialog: Union.. so cannot die!
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: What are you saying? He’s dying.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: He is dying...
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 47.
text: He casts his eyes down, spots a bottle, grabs it.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D)
dialog: Svetlana, just...be strong. And...
dialog: (out of platitudes)
dialog: Try not to be afraid.
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: I wish I knew what not to be afraid
dialog: of.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Nothing. Trust me.
text: An awkward double-fisted “be strong” sign. He hurries out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - DINING ROOM/BEDROOM - DAY 82
text: A vast buffet is added to by a CHEF covered in medals. There
text: are empty vodka bottles everywhere. Smoke hangs in the air.
text: Beria is idly playing billiards, watching a YOUNG WAITRESS.
text: He whistles her over, takes a large tomato from her plate. He
text: bites into it, keeping eye contact. Juice runs down his chin.
text: Kaganovich is near the bed, drinking. Mikoyan’s on the other
text: side of the room with Malenkov, whose hair is over-groomed.
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: You had your hair fucking embalmed
dialog: or something?
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Fuck you. There'll be a lot of
dialog: photos. I can’t let him or the
dialog: Party down.
text: Khrushchev walks in with the vodka, annoyed with himself.
text: He goes to the bed and tries to take part of Stalin's hand.
text: There are only fingers left; Kaganovich is holding the rest.
speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Did you speak to Svetlana?
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (indicates bottle)
dialog: Went very well. She gave me this.
dialog: (off Kaganovich’s look)
text: A good sign. Vodka’s ALWAYS a good
dialog: sign.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 48.
speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: You're right. Beria’s taking over.
dialog: Another 9 NKVD divisions in Moscow.
text: More on the way. Army’s out.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
text: He's moving fast.
text: Bulganin comes in.
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Got to unload to reload.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: You have the bladder of a sparrow.
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
text: But the penis of a horse.
text: Nobody laughs. Mikoyan has joined Beria.
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: (to Bulganin)
dialog: You ARE the penis of a horse.
dialog: (to Beria)
dialog: Tough old bastard. Thought he’d
dialog: just kick Death in the balls.
text: Beria puts a reassuring arm round Mikoyan's waist.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: My friend.
text: Mikoyan pulls a crushed tomato from his jacket pocket. He
text: looks angry, volatile.
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: Piss and tomato AND Stalin dying.
dialog: This is a nightmare.
text: Beria’s about to apologise. Mikoyan waves it away, heads out.
text: Lukomsky enters with two other doctors, who wheel a hefty
text: piece of equipment with a very squeaky wheel.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Who ordered the Wurlitzer?
speaker_heading: LUKOMSKY
dialog: It's... it's a respirator...
dialog: American...
speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: (gobsmacked)
dialog: You brought a capitalist machine...
dialog: in here?
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 49.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: He brought it. It's from his
dialog: hospital!...
speaker_heading: LUKOMSKY
dialog: It was his idea...
text: Khrushchev joins Beria and Malenkov while Kaganovich berates
dialog: the doctors.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: So, you had time at your
dialog: hairdresser’s to mobilise the NKVD?
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I did it. Look, people will need...
dialog: (makes fist)
dialog: ...reassurance.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: So why switch the lights off in
dialog: Stalin's office at the Kremlin?
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Ah... I know what happened. I asked
dialog: for the place to be secured, and
dialog: the dolts have turned the lights
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Why not tether an airship above Red
text: Square with “HE'S DEAD” painted on
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: Take this Uncle Sam shit away!
dialog: (unplugs the machine)
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: He can't breathe!..
text: Svetlana grabs the plug and puts it back in.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: (puts cigarette in his
dialog: mouth)
dialog: It's a good thing he can breathe.
dialog: We're all agreed on that.
text: Malenkov checks no-one is looking and quickly heads out.

text: Later. Beria is having a cigarette in the hallway. Suddenly
text: there are cheers from inside the room.
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - BEDROOM - DAY 85
text: Beria hurries in. The committee and Svetlana are around the

speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: A miracle! Stalin is invincible!
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: The Man Of Steel! He lives!
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: The Boss is back!
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: What? What's happened?
text: Stalin's eyes are open. Beria moves the others out of the way
text: and takes pride of place right by Stalin's head.
speaker_heading: BERIA (CONT'D)
dialog: That's impossible! And wonderful!
dialog: Long live the Union!
text: Stalin meets Beria's eye. Then points at Khrushchev.
speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: Maybe he's appointing a successor?
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (a little bit pleased)
dialog: Do you think?
text: STALIN'S POV: his finger passes across all the committee
text: members. The finger stops, points to Matryona.
speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: Maybe not.
text: He points past her, to the wall. They all turn to look at a
text: painting of a young girl feeding a lamb through a bottle.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Maybe he's saying: "I am like this
dialog: lamb and you, my children, have
dialog: given me life."
dialog: 86
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 51.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: No. Stalin’s the GIRL, nourishing
dialog: the Lamb - the Union - with Marxism-
dialog: Leninism.
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: My father is not a girl!
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: He’s the milk!
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: YOU'RE the tit.
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Maybe he just wants a drink...
text: Everyone agrees. Matryona offers him some water.
text: Stalin lowers his hand. Beria goes to Lukomsky, cowering at
text: the back. He shakes the doctor's hand but doesn't let it go.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: You are a hero, Comrade Lukomsky.
speaker_heading: LUKOMSKY
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: I... Sometimes this happens...
dialog: And... I'm incredibly pleased.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I won't forget it.
text: Beria glares at him - it's a death sentence - then leaves.
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - DAY 86
text: Beria paces. Agitated, defeated. For the first time, we see
dialog: him troubled.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: (sotto, to self)
dialog: Live, or die. This is just...
text: dithering.
text: The original soldier and sergeant are still there, exhausted.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: Sir, we have remained at our post

dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 53.
text: Wide to see we’re in an outhouse near the dacha. A doctor
text: cutting into Stalin’s head with an intense grinding noise.
text: Laboratory and medical equipment surrounded by spare tyres,

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Regrettable! But important this

text: The double doors at the front of the outhouse are hauled

speaker_heading: VASILY
dialog: What are you doing to my father,
dialog: you jackals!
text: The very young doctor is peeling back skin on Stalin's skull.
speaker_heading: VASILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Murderers! You'll kill him!

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Vasily, your father is dead and...
text: Vasily draws his pistol.
speaker_heading: VASILY
dialog: Dividing the spoils? Leave his

text: Beria nods at the NKVD. An NKVD man tries to grab Vasily's
text: gun but he fires it.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 54.
text: Everyone dives for cover. Malenkov runs out of the door and
text: pulls it shut. Bulganin and Khrushchev try to follow but
text: Malenkov's holding it shut from the other side. Khrushchev
text: crouches against the door. Mikoyan stands fearless.
text: NKVD men try to subdue Vasily. He struggles, firing his gun.
speaker_heading: VASILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Here is your fucking... harvest!
text: They drag him away from Stalin but he fires more shots. They
text: hit Stalin. His head rocks forward as if the shots have
text: jolted him into life for a moment.
text: The NKVD get his gun off him. We hear Svetlana's voice.
speaker_heading: SVETLANA (0.S.)
dialog: Vasily! Vasily! Stop!...
text: She's come into the garage. Her voice stops him struggling.
speaker_heading: VASILY
text: Tiny child doctors are cutting up

speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: (very quiet)
dialog: He’s gone, Vasya. Just you and me
dialog: now. Be careful. Remember what Papa
text: said. Wade gently across the river
dialog: because...
dialog: (chythmically digging into
dialog: his face)
dialog: It. Is. Full. Of. Snakes. And.
dialog: Crocodiles.
text: Vasily nods. He's heard her. Svetlana looks at the NKVD men.
speaker_heading: VASILY
dialog: (trying to act normal)
dialog: Someone could have told me what to
dialog: expect. Next time, tell me.
text: Beria nods to the NKVD, who let him go.

speaker_heading: BULGANIN

dialog: that?
speaker_heading: VASILY

speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: (to Malenkov)
dialog: Off you go, kitten!
text: The NKVD men struggle with Vasily, force him to the ground

speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: (close to Vasily)
dialog: Moron. I’m not part of your suicide

speaker_heading: VASILY

speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: Where now for me? And my brother?
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: My men will bring you to Moscow.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV

text: Svetlana senses Beria’s antipathy to Khrushchev.
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: Thank you. But no, I’1l go with

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Our precious cargo.

dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING/BERIA'S CAR - DAY 93
text: Beria arrives at his limo. Khrustalyov opens the door and he
text: gets in. An NKVD officer is in the driver seat, Khrustalyov
text: stays outside. He nods to his boss and heads into the dacha.
text: Inside the car, the young waitress Beria saw earlier is
text: cuffed to the car door. She's frightened. He smiles at her.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I know. Sad times.
text: The car starts but the courtyard’s a logjam of vehicles all
text: trying to get out. Other committee members hurry to their
text: vehicles, drivers holding open the doors for them. Svetlana
text: heads with an NKVD man to her limo. Horns start to blare.
text: Political manoeuvering. NKVD men trying futilely to direct.
text: Then, in the chaos, NKVD men emerge carrying a plain wooden
text: coffin. They load it onto the back of a truck and climb in.
text: Beria gets out of his car. Stands solemnly. The others are
text: obliged to get out and show their respect. The NKVD clear a
text: path for the truck and escorts. Beria’s car following. He’s
dialog: won the scramble.
text: The others start their cars. Horns blaring, cars jostling...
scene_heading: EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING/ROAD - DAY 94
text: The last of the limos drive away. An empty road. Silence.
text: Then - a rumbling, getting nearer. A CONVOY of NKVD trucks
text: coming up the road, through the gates, into the courtyard.
text: Armed NKVD MEN pour out, occupying the house and grounds.
text: Kobulov barks into a loudhailer.
speaker_heading: KOBULOV
dialog: Comrades! We share your grief! You
dialog: will assemble in the courtyard for
dialog: further instructions!
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY 95
text: Busts, portraits, furniture, files, are removed, and medical
text: equipment from the outhouse. Stalin's turntable, the record
text: still on it, is loaded into a box, nailed shut.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 57.
text: Some STAFF are already in a line in front of the house,
text: others are brought out by the NKVD, including the chef and
dialog: the doctors. Some have belongings, some nothing. A lot of
text: orders are being shouted. People are frightened, confused.
text: A supposedly dead Stalin, in a dressing gown and slippers, is
text: marched out. The chef turns to his confused neighbour.
speaker_heading: CHEF
dialog: His lookalike. I think his contract
dialog: just ran out.
text: The LOOKALIKE is taken round the corner to be shot. But the
text: SOLDIER executioner can’t do it. Looks like HIM. Someone
text: quickly throws a cloth over the lookalike’s head. Good. Bang.
text: A second lookalike is marched out. Another, third lookalike,
text: clearly a younger, fitter man, makes a break for it. Close up
text: of a young, fit Stalin running for his life away from the
dialog: dacha. But we cut away before any mine explosion. In fact,
dialog: the explosion doesn't come...
scene_heading: INT/EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - KITCHEN/FRONT - DAY 96
text: Delov and Two NKVD OFFICERS search the kitchen. They discover
text: Matryona, crouched between two gas stoves, her eyes shut.
speaker_heading: DELOV
dialog: Hey, you! On your feet!
text: Matryona is hauled up and dragged out the front door.
text: Now we hear and just about see a mine explode in the woods.
scene_heading: INT. STALIN'S DACHA - HALLWAY - DAY 97
text: The soldier and sergeant are asleep. Khrustalyov appears with

speaker_heading: PERVAK

text: The soldiers dozily comes to attention.
speaker_heading: KHRUSTALYOV
dialog: At ease. You can stand down now.
text: There's food in the kitchen.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: They head down a long corridor with a kitchen at the end.
text: Then the sergeant comes back into view, collapsing to the
text: floor, unconscious. NKVD arms reach into the doorway framing
dialog: our view and drag him out.
dialog: 98
dialog: 99
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 58.
text: The other soldier runs across the doorway followed by two
text: NKVD MEN. It's messy. The soldier may have gotten away into
dialog: the woods. We don’t know.
scene_heading: EXT. STALIN'S DACHA - FRONT OF BUILDING/GROUNDS - DAY 98
text: Loaded trucks pull out of the courtyard.
text: We are with Matryona as the truck moves off. From her pov we
text: see Khrustalyov join Kobulov in the courtyard. They get
text: smaller and smaller in the distance. Kobulov shoots
text: Khrustalyov in the head. Other landmines go off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KHRUSHCHEV'S APARTMENT/MALENKOV'S APARTMENT - EARLY 99
speaker_heading: EVENING

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: So... Beria's introduced 'special

dialog: Carrots.
text: He looks at Bulganin, meaningfully, as if sounding him out.

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D)
dialog: It's good to prepare, get
dialog: everything ready.
text: He looks at Bulganin, meaningfully, as if sounding him out.
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Are we talking about Beria or the
dialog: stroganoff?
text: Khrushchev goes over to his washing machine.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: I built a big factory making these.
text: Khrushchev turns it on. It makes a terrifyingly loud noise.
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: (shouting over it)
dialog: If Russia was a noise, then that
dialog: would be it.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Not so good for washing clothes.
dialog: Very useful for
dialog: “conversations”..about Beria.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 59.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Look, it's important someone takes
dialog: control.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Someone like Beria?
text: The conversation is suddenly significant. Bulganin comes up
text: to Khrushchev so they can talk quietly.
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: It should certainly be someone who
dialog: has the support of all parts of the
dialog: party.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Like Beria?
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Well certainly one of us.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: So... maybe not Beria?
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: You're very good with that knife.
dialog: It’s ...
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I'm saying... maybe not be Beria...
dialog: We should get rid of him.
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Yes. Yes! And soon! Punish him!
text: Stick him in a room with twelve big
dialog: hungry, horny Serbians!
text: Suddenly the washing machine comes to a juddery stop,
text: interrupting Bulganin. The men stare at one another in panic.
text: Khrushchev tastes a spoonful of food, not yet ready to eat.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Mmm. That is good. Delicious.
text: The machine starts again. Khrushchev spits out the food.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D)
dialog: Feh! Raw!
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: We should take acting classes. If

dialog: Look, I want to come on board, but
dialog: we don't have the numbers.
text: Suddenly the phone rings. Has someone been listening in?
text: Tentatively Bulganin answers as Khrushchev adds some of the
text: vegetables to a pot on the stove.
text: We see Malenkov, Mikoyan standing next to him, by the window
dialog: of his apartment.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV (ON PHONE)
dialog: Are you being factional?
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: We're cooking some food.
text: Khrushchev grabs the phone.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: I can see you, you know.
text: We cut to reveal the two apartment windows look on to each
text: other, very close in distance. We see Khrushchev in one
text: window, Malenkov in the other.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV (CONT’D)
dialog: Looks like factionalism to me.
text: Khrushchev grabs a spoonful of stew and stands at the window
text: theatrically eating it.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Tastes like lamb stroganoff to me.
text: Khrushchev hangs up.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK - COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING 100

speaker_heading: POLINA

dialog: No! Our Stalin?
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Yes, “your” Stalin. The one who put

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV

speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
dialog: (shocked, hurt)
dialog: Stalin? I must have wronged him so
dialog: badly...
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Are you cracked? Beria wanted you
dialog: out. But listen. We can honour his
dialog: legacy by making sure Beria
dialog: doesn’t...
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
dialog: Oh! No, no, no. This sounds like

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: We were just chatting about Polina.

speaker_heading: BERIA

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV

dialog: She collaborated with the zionists.
text: Polina's at the doorway. Only Beria can see her. This is not
dialog: going to plan.
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
dialog: She was a criminal. I’m glad she’s
dialog: dead...
text: Molotov notices her in the doorway. They look at each other.
text: The barriers drop - it's clear he still loves her.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (hasn't seen her yet)
dialog: She plotted to poison Stalin...
text: He sees Molotov heading towards Polina. He can't believe it.
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
dialog: Is it really you?
speaker_heading: POLINA
dialog: (full of love)
dialog: I'm back, Vyacheslav.
text: They hug, emotional. Beria enjoys it. Khrushchev tries to dig
text: himself out of his hole.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: But the evidence was flimsy. No
dialog: witnesses, no corroboration...
dialog: No...
text: Khrushchev gives up. Beria puts his arm round Molotov and
text: Polina. It becomes a group hug.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: (to Molotov)
dialog: I kept her safe. For you,
dialog: Vyacheslav.
dialog: (to Polina)

speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: I have something to tell you.

speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Shall we get onto..
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Yes, the committee meeting. Item
dialog: One. The lists. These arrests and
dialog: “interrogations”. Do we just take
dialog: them down a gear, or....
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Hold off altogether?
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: What, “freeze” them?
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: “Freeze”? Excellent thought. Yes,
dialog: we could freeze arrests, maybe even
dialog: release some low-level prisoners?
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Oh, fuck me. Really? Is this what
dialog: the old man would have wanted?
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Stalin was radical and popular.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV

speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: My chief concern is admitting we

dialog: deaths...
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: We were being loyal. I promoted
dialog: Stalin’s truth without question. I
dialog: can promote a new truth without
dialog: blinking.
text: An unblinking beat.
speaker_heading: BERIA (CONT'D)
dialog: So, I’1l push on with the releases?
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Alright, but proceed carefully.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Fuck this up and I’1l have you

text: Beria says nothing.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV (CONT’D)
dialog: Just joking. I was testing you.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Is that a corset?

speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: It's a girdle. Different thing
dialog: altogether.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: You wear it well.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 70.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: But not worth raising with the

scene_heading: EXT. KREMLIN - STREET - DAY 117
text: Several more Zis limousines arrive at the Kremlin.
scene_heading: INT. KREMLIN - MEETING ROOM N°1 - DAY 118
text: The committee sit at a table in an impressive, high-ceilinged
text: room. Malenkov is at the head of the table with his new
text: hairdo and a smart new outfit. The room is dominated by a
text: giant portrait of Stalin.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: So, in accordance with...
dialog: (re portrait)
dialog: .--his will, I propose Comrade
dialog: Malenkov be named Chairman of the
dialog: Council of Ministers. And General
dialog: Secretary of the Party.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: (pompous nod)
dialog: And I propose Comrade Beria for
dialog: First Vice-Chairman, Council of
dialog: Ministers. Those in favour.
text: Beria, Malenkov and Mikoyan instantly put their hands up.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Wait. Those are two separate
dialog: proposals. Comrade Beria is
dialog: incredibly busy combining his roles
dialog: as Minister for both the Interior
dialog: and Security. It would perhaps be
dialog: kinder for someone else to carry
text: the happy burden of Vice-Chairman.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I thank Comrade Khrushchev for his
dialog: concern but I can assure you that
dialog: I'm capable of doing two things at
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Well, it would actually be three
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Let's move to a vote.
dialog: (to Beria)
dialog: On both proposals?
text: Beria gesticulates as if to say 'Up to you'.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 71.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV (CONT’D)
dialog: Yes, on both. Me as General
dialog: Secretary and Comrade Beria as Vice-
dialog: Chairman. All those in favour?
text: Malenkov, Beria and Mikoyan raise their hands. Molotov joins
text: them, then Bulganin and Kaganovich.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV (CONT’D)
dialog: Carried...
text: Grudgingly, Khrushchev raises his hand.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV (CONT’D)
dialog: ..+-unanimously. Next...
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: We need someone to take charge of
dialog: the funeral.
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
dialog: What about Comrade Khrushchev?
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (looking at Beria)
dialog: Where’s this come from?
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Yes, good thought.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I formally propose that Comrade
dialog: Khrushchev be given the honour of
dialog: organising the funeral.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (to Beria)
dialog: But that will tie up all of my
dialog: time, won't it?
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: If I can do three jobs at once, you
dialog: can at least do two.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: But I need to be...
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You wanted to honour his legacy.
dialog: You told me last night, in the
dialog: bathroom.
text: Molotov winks at Khrushchev: he's doing him a great favour.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV/BERIA
dialog: All those in favour..
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 72.
text: Again, Molotov, Beria, Malenkov and Mikoyan raise their
text: hands. Kaganovich decides to raise his hand.
speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: (justifying himself)
dialog: You'd be good at it.
text: Bulganin raises his hand.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Carried... U... una...
text: Then, grudgingly again, Khrushchev.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV (CONT’D)
dialog: .-carried unanimously.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Thank you. I shall remember this.
text: Beria looks to Malenkov.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: (trying to be formal)
dialog: Comrade Beria.
text: Beria clears his throat, looks extravagantly at ease.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I propose a halt to deportations.
dialog: The release of some existing
dialog: detainees. And the suspension of
dialog: arrests officially sanctioned three
dialog: days ago...
text: Molotov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich and Bulganin are shocked.
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: You dare wipe your shitting arse on
dialog: Stalin's lists!?
speaker_heading: BULGANIN
dialog: Let's all stay calm... although
dialog: what you just said is utterly
dialog: ridiculous.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: (angry)
dialog: One of you look me in the eye and
dialog: tell me you’re not heartsick at the
text: relentless, pointless arrests.
text: Death after death after DEATH.
text: A charged beat as he looks around the room, defiant.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Gentlemen, I believe we must
dialog: embrace a new reality.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 73.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV (CONT’D)
dialog: (“wanker” mime)
dialog: Yeah. “Embrace” it...
speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: How are we going to explain all the
dialog: people you very comprehensively
dialog: arrested in the first place?
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: If there were errors, if people
dialog: misguided us then we punish those
dialog: who did the misguiding...
speaker_heading: MIKOYAN
dialog: Arrest anyone who carried out a
dialog: wrongful arrest? Lavrentiy, come
dialog: on. We ALL signed off on that
dialog: shit...
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: (thinks he can be
dialog: commanding)
dialog: Stalin destroyed the status quo and
dialog: built a new one. He was radical.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: This is deliberately being rushed
dialog: through. We don’t have time to..
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I thought you were in favour of a
dialog: more liberal approach, Comrade
dialog: Reformer.
text: Khrushchev remains silent, roiling with conflicting emotions.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: We must step back...
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: All those in favour...
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: ...of pausing the arrests and
dialog: executions and so on?
text: Malenkov and Beria raise their arms. Mikoyan, reluctantly,
text: joins them. Bulganin, Khrushchev and Kaganovich look at
dialog: Molotov.
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV
dialog: I have always been loyal to Stalin.
dialog: Always. And these arrests were
dialog: authorised by Stalin.
dialog: 20 May 2016 Draft 10 74.
text: The rest of the committee follow Molotov’s lengthy logic with
dialog: increasing frustration.
speaker_heading: MOLOTOV (CONT’D)
dialog: But Stalin was always loyal to the
dialog: collective leadership. That is true
dialog: loyalty. But he had an iron
text: principle, undeviating, strong.
dialog: Shouldn’t we do the same, and stick
dialog: to what we believed in? No. It’s
dialog: stronger still to forge one’s own
dialog: beliefs into the beliefs of
dialog: collective leadership.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Which I have now done.
text: Molotov raises his hand. Kaganovich and Bulganin raise
text: theirs. Finally, Khrushchev raises his hand.
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: Carried...
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: Good, I'll oversee...
speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: (interrupting)
text: Unanimously.
speaker_heading: BERIA
dialog: I'll oversee the releases. We have
dialog: unloosened the Union’s great
dialog: corset. Nikita, you've some
text: swatches and bouquets to look at. A
dialog: funeral doesn't organise itself.
text: We stay on Khrushchev as Molotov leans over. Malenkov

speaker_heading: MALENKOV
dialog: (in background)
dialog: Beria, I want you to put

speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: (furious)
dialog: What about Tukhachevsky and
dialog: Piatakov and Meyerhold and
dialog: Mikhoels? Didn't they deserve a
dialog: trial? And poor Sokolnikov. Who
dialog: begged him to look after his
dialog: elderly mother. That monster
dialog: strangled her in front of him. I’ve
dialog: killed a lot of people. I did it
dialog: because it was my duty. That human
dialog: turd killed for pleasure.
text: Khrushchev puts a brotherly hand on Malenkov’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D)

dialog: brutal things.
text: But Svetlana is shocked, and moves away from the group. She

speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH

speaker_heading: SVETLANA

dialog: too...
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: (re envelope contents)
dialog: Vienna?
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: Vasily must stay. For his own
dialog: safety. We can’t have a drunken
dialog: madman spreading conspiracy
dialog: theories all over the world...
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: I could...
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
dialog: No. He stays. You must go, for YOUR
dialog: sake. There will be a reckoning
dialog: here. Your...story may not fit. One
dialog: of these men might have to kill
dialog: you...
text: She’s shocked. Khrushchev needs her to look at him. She does.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV (CONT'D)
dialog: I might have to kill you.
text: A stunned beat. Her bitter smile. She looks at Malenkov,
dialog: Mikoyan, Bulganin...
speaker_heading: SVETLANA
dialog: I never thought it would be you.
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV

speaker_heading: KAGANOVICH
dialog: Can you ever trust a weak man?
speaker_heading: KHRUSHCHEV
