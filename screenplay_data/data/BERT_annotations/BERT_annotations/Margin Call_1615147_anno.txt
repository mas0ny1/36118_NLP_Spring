scene_heading: INT. LARGE INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY
dialog: 1 1
text: The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27-
text: year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT
text: and is staring intently into a large bank of computer
dialog: screens.
text: An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come
text: out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down
text: a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of
text: the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into
text: frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and
text: several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling
text: thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy
text: sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his
dialog: early twenties.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Is that them?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (nods yes)
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large
text: glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as
text: almost every person on the floor watches.
speaker_heading: SETH (cont'd)
dialog: Are they going to do it right there?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Fuck me.
text: WILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: Have you guys ever seen this before?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Best to just ignore it. Keep your head
dialog: down and get back to work... and don't
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: 1 CONTINUED: 1
text: The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a
text: piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person
text: and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one
text: HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and
text: into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS
text: then stops a bit down from them.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Timothy Singh?
speaker_heading: TIMOTHY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I'm afraid we have to speak with you.
text: TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with
text: the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP
text: MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost
text: back into the numbers on his computer screen.
text: The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing
text: people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer
text: screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until
text: finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and
text: stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off
text: his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (cont'd)
dialog: Eric Dale?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Eric Dale?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm not Eric Dale.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh. I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He's my boss, he's down that hall.

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HEATHER

dialog: 2 2
text: There is a more senior looking Human Resources lawyer, LAUREN
text: BRATBERG, already sitting at the table. They all sit and look
text: at each other for a beat.
speaker_heading: LAUREN BRATBERG
dialog: Well... Mr. Dale I'm obviously sorry that
dialog: we are here today but these are extra
dialog: ordinary times as you very well must
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I run risk management... it just doesn't
dialog: seem like a natural place to start
dialog: cutting.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I hope you understand that this is in no
dialog: way personal. A majority of this floor is
dialog: being let go today.
speaker_heading: ERIC
speaker_heading: OK
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: Mr. Dale. Ms. Bratberg is now going to

speaker_heading: ERIC
speaker_heading: OK
text: LAUREN BRATBERG slides across the table a very thick
dialog: severance contract agreement.
speaker_heading: LAUREN BRATBERG
dialog: Mr. Dale the firm is offering you six
dialog: months severance at half your salary. You
dialog: will keep all unvested options that you
dialog: currently hold. Health will be extended

text: She looks at her watch.
speaker_heading: LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)
dialog: 4:47 to either take the offer or it will
dialog: be revoked. Do you understand?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LAUREN BRATBERG
dialog: Now, unfortunately Mr. Dale due to the
dialog: highly sensitive nature of your work here
dialog: the firm has to take certain precautions
dialog: for security purposes that may seem
dialog: punitive in nature. I hope considering
dialog: your...
text: SHE looks down at the piece of paper in front of her to fact
dialog: check.
speaker_heading: LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)
dialog: ...over 19 years of service to the firm,
dialog: you will understand that these measures
dialog: are in no way a reflection of the firms'
dialog: feelings towards your performance or your
dialog: character.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I'm sorry??
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: She's apologizing for what's about to
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: LAUREN BRATBERG
dialog: Your company email, access to the server,
dialog: access to the building, and your mobile

text: GUARD is standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: LAUREN BRATBERG (cont'd)
dialog: will take you to your office so that you
dialog: can clear out your personal belongings.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: What about my current ongoing work? I'm
dialog: right in the...
speaker_heading: LAUREN BRATBERG
dialog: The firm has worked out its transition
text: plan and is prepared to move forward, but
dialog: we appreciate your concern.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: We understand that this is very difficult
dialog: and here is my card. Please contact me
dialog: over the next few weeks if there is
dialog: anything that I can do to help you
dialog: through this transition in your life.
text: They all stare at each other in silence for several long
text: awkward beats.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Sir?
text: ERIC finally stands up and walks out with the guard and back
text: over to his office.
scene_heading: INT. ERIC DALE'S OFFICE
dialog: 3 3
text: ERIC walks into the office and sits at his desk and begins to
text: clear his things out into a file box. The guard stands at the

text: immediate superior, WILL EMERSON comes to the door.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Will.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: If there was anything I coulda done, you

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: One more thing... Who was it?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Was it Rogers?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: You know me. I'm not gonna say...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Robertson?
text: WILL EMERSON just looks back at him in silence.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: That cunt. I knew it. I never should have
dialog: gone to her last year.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Look it wasn't anyone. It's just bad
dialog: luck. Right....?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Good luck.

speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: ERIC

dialog: bunch of shit here that someone should
dialog: really take a look at.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Eric, they are telling us that everyone
dialog: has got to get out of here and leave
dialog: everything behind. While we appreciate
dialog: your concern, this is not your problem
dialog: anymore. Alright? Good luck.
text: ERIC looks straight ahead as WILL leaves the office. He packs
text: up the last of his things, which does not take long, then
text: stands and gets ready to walk out. He looks around and heads

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: That's not necessary.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well it is... You were the person around

text: begins to walk back toward his desk.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I know.
text: PETER turns back and ERIC reaches into one of his boxes and
text: takes out a small key chain portable hard drive and hands it
text: to PETER.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: I was close to something here... But they
dialog: wouldn't let me finish it. Take a look.

speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Much.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Got any nicorettes? I'm out of

dialog: alright?
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: My dog is dying.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Just spoke to the vet, it's some fucking
dialog: tumor on her liver. I'm paying almost a
dialog: thousand bucks a day to keep her alive.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Yeah... and I don't have a clue what to
dialog: do about it.
text: They both sit in silence and look out the window.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Well they're all gone.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: How many do we have left?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Thirty-three.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Make sure everyone is out there, I need
dialog: to say something.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: They are ready for you.

scene_heading: INT. TRADING FLOOR
dialog: 7 7
text: SAM ROGERS walks out of his office and stands in front of the
text: trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 people.
text: Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast
text: mostly empty space. They all look up in silence at him. Long
text: pause, then SAM'S face begins to glow a bit. His posture
text: straightens, he fills up. He speaks slowly at first then
dialog: builds.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: You are all still here for a reason...
dialog: Most of this floor was just sent home...
dialog: forever. We have spent the last hour
dialog: saying good-bye... they were good people
dialog: and they were good at their jobs... but
dialog: you all were better. Now they are gone.
dialog: They are not to be thought of again. This
dialog: is your opportunity. On every floor of
dialog: this building and in every office from
dialog: Hong Kong to London the same thing is
dialog: happening. Before this is all done 3 of
dialog: every ten guys who were standing between
dialog: you and your boss's job are now gone.
dialog: That is your opportunity. I've been at
dialog: this place for thirty-four years and let
dialog: me tell you that this will not be the
dialog: last time you go through this. But you
dialog: all are survivors... And that is how this
dialog: firm over 107 years has always continued
dialog: to grow stronger. So hold your heads
dialog: high... and get back to work.

dialog: 9 9
text: ERIC DALE walks out the front door carrying the file boxes.
text: There are other people streaming out the door doing the same
text: thing. ERIC stops, turns, and looks up at the building then
text: tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it
text: has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and
text: can't believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman,
text: SARAH ROBERTSON, serious, classically beautiful and dressed
text: in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into
text: the building. He can't help himself.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: 9 CONTINUED: 9
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Robertson!
text: SARAH does not respond.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: Sarah Robertson!
text: This time she looks up. When she sees him she debates if she
text: should stop. She does. He slowly moves a little closer to
text: her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his
text: personal belongings in it.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: You shut off my phone???
speaker_heading: SARAH ROBERTSON
dialog: Eric... I didn't do anything.
text: They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fuck you.
text: They look at each other for a longer beat, both a little
text: shocked that ERIC was so openly confrontational. She turns
text: and heads back inside quickly. ERIC drops the phone to the
text: ground and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. TRADING FLOOR - EVENING
dialog: 10 10
text: Most of the remaining traders are packing up and getting
text: ready to go home or out for the night. PETER is sitting at
text: his desk holding the portable hard drive. SETH is getting
text: ready to leave behind him. PETER stares down at the drive in
text: his hand trying to decide whether to proceed.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You ok?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah. Just a little freaked out.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You want to get a drink?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Nah, I need to clean up a few things

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Be glad, you're still alive.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I am.
text: SETH walks out and PETER puts on his headphones, the MUSIC
text: kicks in again. He picks up the portable hard drive, looks
text: around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. He
text: has four large screens in front of him and as he begins
text: opening window upon window of mathematical models his face
text: begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. The frame

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: What are those levels.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well it's a fairly complicated...
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
dialog: As far as I can tell these here are the

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS

dialog: came out.
speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: Where is Eric Dale now?
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS

speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: What's a specialty in propulsion?
speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: JARED COHEN

speaker_heading: JARED COHEN

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well it's all just numbers really, you're

speaker_heading: RAMESH

speaker_heading: JARED COHEN

speaker_heading: SARAH ROBERTSON
dialog: Look we'd need a little more time to go

speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: Weeks?
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Yes. But as you certainly know our
dialog: business is selling AND buying. It
dialog: doesn't work for very long without both
dialog: components. If we suddenly stop buying
dialog: for a day or two that just doesn't hide
dialog: under the rug, it gets out and this whole

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: JARED COHEN

speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS

speaker_heading: JARED COHEN

speaker_heading: RAMESH

speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Yes, here it is.
text: SAM slides him the hard drive across the table, they all take

speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: And Sam we need Eric Dale, it's making me

speaker_heading: JARED.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Did you know the fear most people feel
dialog: when they stand on the edge like this is
dialog: not actually a fear that they will fall
dialog: but instead it's the subconscious fearing
dialog: that they might jump? ....It's a fear of
dialog: losing faith.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well that's a little deep and depressing,
dialog: thank you.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Yeah well, I can get a little dark
dialog: sometimes.
speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: SETH

dialog: for ten years and I've seen some things
dialog: that you wouldn't believe... and when all
dialog: is said and done... they don't lose

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Yeah... I did.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What do you do with all that money?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: I don't know really. It goes pretty

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Two and a half million goes quickly?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Well the tax man takes half of it up
dialog: front. So now you got what... million and

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: 76,520?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was

speaker_heading: SARAH ROBERTSON

speaker_heading: JARED COHEN

speaker_heading: ASSISTANT

speaker_heading: JARED COHEN

scene_heading: INT. CEO'S EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: 45 45
text: They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference
text: room with a commanding view of the city. It is filled with
text: people along one side of the table. There are a team of five

text: members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits
text: RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of
text: the table is empty.
text: They all file in and sit down. They all sit in silence...
text: waiting. Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking
text: into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is
text: not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head.
text: He carries himself without much exception. His eyes however
text: tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He walks the
text: length of the room, everyone half stands up.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Please sit down.
text: He then seats himself at the head of the table. Everyone in
text: the room has the printout in front of them. JARED is seated
text: immediately to his left, then SAM, then SARAH, RAMESH, WILL,
text: PETER, and finally SETH.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD (cont'd)
dialog: Welcome everyone. I must apologize for
dialog: dragging you all here at such an uncommon
dialog: hour but from what I've been told this
dialog: matter needs to be handled urgently, so
dialog: urgently in fact that it probably should
dialog: have been addressed weeks ago...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: JOHN TULD (cont'd)

text: Everyone looks around the room a bit and finally JARED speaks
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if
dialog: you look here at the top page of this
dialog: printout...
text: He cuts him off.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Jared, it's a little early for all that,
dialog: how bout in English? ... Actually I'd
dialog: like to hear from the guy who put this
dialog: thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it?
dialog: Does he speak English?
speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: I'd like to speak to the analyst who
dialog: seems to have stumbled across this mess.
speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: Well, that's Peter Sullivan here.
text: JARED looks down the table to PETER, as does everyone else in
text: the room. JARED gives him a go ahead look.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sir.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Ah, there he is.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: How old are you Mr. Sullivan?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I'm twenty-seven sir.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Please call me John.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes sir.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 49.
scene_heading: 45 CONTINUED: (2) 45
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me
dialog: what you think is going on here, and
dialog: please speak as you might to a young
dialog: child or a golden retriever, I didn't get
dialog: here on my brains I can assure you of
dialog: that.
text: PETER is very nervous.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not
dialog: know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an
dialog: associate in the risk assessment and
speaker_heading: management office at MBS
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Now you lost me at M...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sorry...
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: I was joking Mr. Sullivan.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes... Well as you probably know over the
dialog: last 36-40 months the firm has begun
dialog: packaging new MBS products that combine
dialog: several different traunches of rating
dialog: classification in one tradable security.
dialog: This has been very profitable as I
dialog: imagine you noticed.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: I have.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well the firm is currently doing a
dialog: considerable amount of this business
dialog: every day. The problem, which is I guess
dialog: why we are here tonight, is that it takes
dialog: us... the firm... almost a month to layer
dialog: these products correctly thereby posing a
dialog: challenge from a risk management
dialog: standpoint.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We have to hold these assets on our books
dialog: longer than we might ideally like to.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 50.
scene_heading: 45 CONTINUED: (3) 45
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But the key factor is these are
dialog: essentially just mortgages, so that has
dialog: allowed us to push the leverage
dialog: considerably beyond what you might be
dialog: willing, or allowed to do in any other
dialog: circumstance, thereby pushing the risk
text: profile without raising any red flags.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: And how far have we pushed that profile
dialog: tonight Mr. Sullivan?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion
dialog: dollars... at MBS alone.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Give or take.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Give or take.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and
dialog: give me a little rope here, what I am
dialog: guessing that your report here says is
dialog: that considering the, shall we say bumpy
dialog: road, we've been on the last week or so
dialog: that the numbers that your brilliant co-
dialog: workers up the line ahead of you had come
dialog: up with in the past don't seem to make
dialog: much sense anymore considering what's
dialog: taking place today?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Actually not taking place today but
dialog: what's already taken place over the last
dialog: two weeks.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: So what you're saying is it's already
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sort of.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say
dialog: that means for us here?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: 45 CONTINUED: (4) 45
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, that's where it becomes a
dialog: projection. But...
text: PETER looks down at JARED for approval to go forward.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well... sir... if those assets were to
dialog: decrease by just 25 percent, and remain
dialog: on our books... well... that loss would
dialog: be greater than the current market
dialog: capitalization of this company.
text: The room goes silent. JOHN TULD looks at PETER long and hard.
text: He then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into
dialog: the city.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is
text: that the music appears to be about to
dialog: stop and we are going to be holding the
dialog: biggest bag of stinking shit ever
dialog: assembled in the history of capitalism?
text: Everyone looks back at PETER.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD (cont'd)
dialog: Mr. Sullivan?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that
dialog: way but let me clarify using your
dialog: analogy, what this model shows is the
text: music, so to speak, just slowing, if the
dialog: music were to stop, as you put it, then
dialog: this model would not be even close to
dialog: that scenario. It would be considerably
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Well let me tell you something Mr.
dialog: Sullivan. Do you want to know why I'm
dialog: sitting here in this chair with you all,
dialog: why I get the big bucks, so to speak?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: I'm here for one reason and one reason
dialog: only.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: JOHN TULD (cont'd)
dialog: I'm here to guess what the music is gonna

dialog: it, nothing more....... and I'm afraid...
dialog: standing here tonight... that I don't
dialog: hear... a... thing... just silence.
text: The room falls completely still for at least half a minute.
text: Then JOHN TULD spins around quickly with a considerably more
text: upbeat tone and looks up and down the table.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD (cont'd)
dialog: So, now that we know that the music has
dialog: stopped, what can we do about it?
dialog: Long Silence.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD (cont'd)
dialog: Mr. Cohen, Ms. Robertson, I'm afraid this
dialog: is where you are supposed to step back
dialog: in. Lord knows we relied enough on Mr.
dialog: Sullivan today.
text: JARED and SARAH come to attention and gather their thoughts.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD (cont'd)
dialog: What have you got for us?
dialog: Long pause.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD (cont'd)
dialog: What have I told you since the first day
dialog: you walked into my office? (pause) That
dialog: there are three ways to make a living in
dialog: this business... Be first, be smarter, or
dialog: cheat. Well I don't cheat, and even
dialog: though I like to think we have got some
dialog: pretty smart people in this building of
dialog: the two remaining options, it sure is a
dialog: hell of alot easier to just be first.
text: The room goes silent again as Mr. Tuld stares back out the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: JARED COHEN

speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS

speaker_heading: JOHN TULD

dialog: made you... how would you do it?
text: SAM ROGERS looks down at the table for a long, long, beat.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: You bring the traders in for their normal
dialog: 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them,
dialog: they're gonna know it's the end either
dialog: way, so you'd have to throw them a bone,
dialog: and a pretty big one. You'd have to come
text: out of the gate storming... 40 percent
dialog: done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your
dialog: positions need to be gone by eleven,
dialog: cause by lunch the word will be out. No
dialog: swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: They want me to get you back there, they

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (with pleasant disgust)
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: I'm just saying.
speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Fuck her... Fuck her.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: They'll pay...
text: ERIC looks over at WILL. WILL lets him know with a look that

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I've already been paid enough by them.
text: ERIC looks back out onto the empty street.
speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)
dialog: Did you know I built a bridge once?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: ERIC
text: A bridge.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: No, I didn't.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: I was an engineer by trade.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: It goes from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to

speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)

dialog: miles of driving a day... and 25,410,000
dialog: miles a month and 304,920,000 miles a

speaker_heading: ERIC (cont'd)

dialog: years ago. Over the life of that one
dialog: bridge that's 6 billion... 708 million...
dialog: 240 thousand miles that haven't had to be
dialog: driven! At let's say... 50 miles an hour
dialog: that's 134,164,800 hours... or 559,020
dialog: days... so that one little bridge has
dialog: saved the people of those two communities
dialog: a combined 1531 years of their lives not
dialog: wasted in the car... give or take.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: ERIC

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: So, am I getting fired?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
dialog: Probably...yes...almost definitely.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: No.
text: This clearly hits SETH but he recovers quickly.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: It's not personal, you're just in the

speaker_heading: SETH (CONT'D) (cont'd)
dialog: When did you know this is what you wanted
dialog: to do?
text: He thinks that through.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: The first time I made 36 million dollars
dialog: for the firm in the last eleven minutes
dialog: of the trading day.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Fuck me.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: It was a perfect trade...I saw it coming
dialog: from three days away. I took my time. I
dialog: was in, I was out...Pish posh...And it
dialog: was beautiful.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: How did you learn to do that?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: I'm not sure, and whatever it is it could

speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON (CONT'D) (cont'd)

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Don't be, you're not doing it to me.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: I know...but I'm still sorry. At least
dialog: you'll have some decent cash to walk away
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Only if we can get this done, right?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON

speaker_heading: SETH

text: This line sits there for a minute and WILL looks out onto the

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Are you ok with that?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: I'm about to completely fuck guys I've
dialog: been doing business with for fifteen
dialog: years so no I'm not exactly ok with it.
dialog: But look, every last one of them would do
dialog: the same thing to me in a second...so it
dialog: is what it is.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I guess. And what about everyone else?
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: Everyone else?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Normal people.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON
dialog: What are you a socialist? Fuck me Seth.
text: WILL looks over at SETH, sizing him up, looking to see if he
dialog: has what it takes.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
dialog: Look, If you want to do this with your
dialog: life, and do it well, you need to believe
dialog: that you are necessary. And you are. If
dialog: people want to live like this...with
dialog: their big cars and these houses that they
dialog: haven't even paid for. Then you are
dialog: necessary. The only reason they can
dialog: continue to live like kings is because

dialog: wants that, they say they do...but they
dialog: don't. They want what we're giving them,
dialog: but they also want to play innocent and
dialog: pretend they have no idea how we get it.
dialog: And that's more hypocrisy than I can
dialog: swallow. So fuck em.
text: Long look out at the city ahead.
speaker_heading: WILL EMERSON (cont'd)
dialog: And tomorrow if this all goes south
dialog: they'll crucify us for being reckless,

dialog: back on track. They'll be laughing their
dialog: arses off at us for being the biggest
dialog: bunch of pussies that God ever let
text: through the door.

dialog: of us would like for this to be going
text: down, but the ground is shifting below
dialog: our feet, and there appears to be no
dialog: other way out.
text: SAM looks around the room again, person by person and sees
dialog: that they indeed know what needs to be done.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
dialog: Obviously... this is a very unique
dialog: situation... if we are successful today
dialog: we will have been successful in
dialog: destroying our own jobs... I can not
dialog: promise that each of you will be
dialog: repositioned within the firm, but I can
dialog: tell you that I am very proud of the work
dialog: we have done together here, I have been
dialog: at this here for 34 years, and I know...
dialog: from experience people are going to say
dialog: some nasty stuff about what we have done
dialog: here, and what you have devoted a portion
dialog: of your life to. But have faith that in
dialog: the greater picture our skills have not
dialog: been wasted, we have accomplished much,
dialog: and our talents have served some greater
dialog: good...

scene_heading: INT. TRADING FLOOR- 8:20 AM
dialog: 68 68
text: There is a very quiet energy on the floor. A low murmur. Then
text: a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that
text: the CEO, JOHN TULD is about to come onto the floor. He
text: appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent. JOHN
text: walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into
text: the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. He
text: looks around and stands in letting the drama build. Then he
text: climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a
dialog: general.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: By the end of today almost everyone else
dialog: in the world, including me, will have
dialog: considerably less money than they began
dialog: the day with..... You, in this room, are
dialog: the exception. You will leave here today
dialog: richer. You will fire the first shot, I
dialog: wish it didn't have to be, but at times
dialog: the market must eat its weak, and you
dialog: all... are not the weak. We must strike
dialog: quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause
text: on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is
dialog: going to be in here getting in your
dialog: faces, sniffing around, you let us take
dialog: care of them and you just keep going. We
dialog: own what we are choosing to sell today
dialog: and there is nothing they can do about
dialog: it. 107 years ago this firm was founded,
dialog: today we secure our place for next 107.
dialog: You've got two minutes before we get
dialog: started. Let's finish this, so we can get
dialog: on to the next one...
text: JOHN TULD climbs down from the table. SAM, who is standing
text: off to the side, walks along the entire floor slowly and then
text: heads into his office.
scene_heading: INT. SAM ROGER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 69 69
text: He shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes
text: almost silent. Through the glass you see the trading floor go
text: wild, then he walks over to his desk, turns around and stares
text: into the four large computer screens as the charts and graphs
text: begin to move. We just see the back of his head.
scene_heading: INT. INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY
dialog: 70 70
dialog: Several actual individual trading sequences throughout the

scene_heading: INT. SAM ROGER'S OFFICE - 4:02 PM
dialog: 71 71
text: The market has closed. SAM sits, staring at his computers.
text: There is a knock on his door. He turns and as it opens we
text: hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration. He looks up
text: and JARED COHEN is standing in his doorway.
speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: Well done.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: They did alright.
speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: I wanted to give you a heads up. They are
dialog: going to start sending some people home
dialog: out here.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Now?
speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: (He nods yes) Sorry. No loose ends.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: JARED COHEN
dialog: For what it's worth, you're good... Guess
dialog: somebody upstairs must really like you.
text: SAM stands up and walks past JARED without another word.
scene_heading: INT. TRADING FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 72 72
text: He heads down the hallway and passes the HEATHER and LAUREN
text: BRATBERG from the opening scene who are returning with boxes
text: to lay off more people. SAM heads off towards the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. SENIOR EXECUTIVE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 73 73
text: The room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of
text: floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city
text: beyond. The room is empty except for JOHN TULD sitting at the
text: last table. TULD looks a little surprised to see SAM but
text: waves him down. SAM approaches.
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Sam, please sit. Congratulations are
text: clearly in order.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Our guys did what they could.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: 73 CONTINUED: 73
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: You did a hell of a job today, and I
dialog: thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for
dialog: eating but it's been a long day. Can I
dialog: get you anything?
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: No, no thanks.
text: They just sit in silence for a long beat as TULD takes a few
text: more bites of his meal.
speaker_heading: TULD
dialog: So what can I do for you?
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: I want out.
speaker_heading: TULD
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: I'm done, I want out.
speaker_heading: TULD
dialog: It's been a very difficult day, for
dialog: everyone.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: I need you to release my options, that is
dialog: if they're still worth anything after
dialog: today, and I need the bonus. I'm out.
speaker_heading: TULD
dialog: You'll get the bonus, the options, and
dialog: keep your current base, but I need you to
dialog: stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?
text: They look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually
text: a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another
text: hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up.
speaker_heading: TULD (cont'd)
dialog: For God's sake man put a smile on your
dialog: face, you did some good today, you said
dialog: so yourself. I'm starting to feel a
dialog: little better about this whole thing.
dialog: You're one of the luckiest guys in the
dialog: world, you could've been digging ditches
dialog: all these years...
text: SAM pushes back his chair, stands, and prepares to leave.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: 73 CONTINUED: (2) 73
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: That's true, and if I had been at least
dialog: there'd be some holes in the ground to
dialog: show for it. I'm just not quite sure how
dialog: we fucked this thing up so badly.
text: This pushes TULD a bit too far. He also senses he may be
text: losing SAM. He drops his fork, and his tone changes.
speaker_heading: TULD
dialog: Jesus, when did you start feeling so
dialog: sorry for yourself, it's unbearable...
dialog: What, you think we may have helped put
dialog: some people out of business today? That
dialog: it's all just for naught? Well you've
dialog: been doing that everyday for almost forty
dialog: years Sam. And if all this is for naught
dialog: then so is everything else out there.
dialog: It's just money, it's made up, a piece of
dialog: paper with some pictures on it so we
dialog: don't all kill each other trying to get
dialog: something to eat. But it's not wrong and
dialog: it's certainly not any different today
dialog: than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797,
dialog: 1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37,
dialog: `73, and 1987... God damn did that
dialog: motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97,
dialog: 2000, and whatever this is gonna be
dialog: called. They're just the same thing over
dialog: and over. We can't help ourselves, and
dialog: you and I can't control it, stop it, slow
dialog: it, or even ever so slightly alter it...
dialog: We just react... and we get paid well for
dialog: it if we're right... and get left by the
dialog: side of the road if we're wrong. There's
dialog: always been and there's always gonna be
dialog: the same percentage of winners and
text: losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat
dialog: pigs and starving dogs in this world...
dialog: yes there may be more of us today... but
dialog: the percentages... they always stay
dialog: exactly the same.
text: They stare at each other for a long beat and then TULD looks
text: down and takes another bite. He chews. He looks up again.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: I'll do it John, but not because of your
dialog: little speech, but because I need the
dialog: money. I'm not sure how it could possibly
dialog: be after all these years, but I need the
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: 73 CONTINUED: (3) 73
text: They both look at each other again, then look over and see
text: JARED COHEN walking down the dining room aisle with PETER
text: SULLIVAN next to him.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
dialog: You're keeping the kid?
speaker_heading: JOHN TULD
dialog: Keeping him? He's getting promoted. It's
dialog: all hands on deck now Sam, there's going
dialog: to be a lot of money to be made coming
dialog: out of this mess, we're going to need all
dialog: the brains we can get around here.
text: They look at each other one last time then SAM starts walking
text: away and as he passes PETER he just gives him a slight nod.
text: VERY SLOW FADE TO BLACK:
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK:
text: We hear the sound of someone digging in dirt with a shovel.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. VERY UPSCALE OLD GROWTH SUBURBAN NYC BACKYARD- 11:00 PM 74
dialog: 74
text: Fade up on SAM ROGERS standing in a hole in the backyard
text: digging. Next to him is a large black medical-looking bag.
text: He continues to dig. Eventually the flood lights from the
text: house come on and the whole back yard lights up. Then the
text: door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and
text: slippers comes out onto the deck. It is SAM'S EX-WIFE. MARY
text: ROGERS. She squints towards the back of the yard.
speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS
dialog: Hello! ... I've called the police.
text: SAM stops digging and looks up and leans on the shovel
dialog: handle.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS

speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS (cont'd)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Ella died.
text: MARY looks down and sees the large canine body bag.
speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS
dialog: Oh God.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
text: Tumor on her liver. It was horrible.
speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS
dialog: Well I'm very sorry.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Yeah... I really loved that dog
speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS
dialog: I know, but Sam you don't live here
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: I was driving home from the vet and this
dialog: is the only place I could think to bury
dialog: her. This is where she belongs...
text: She looks at him deeply.
speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS
dialog: Well. You should have called.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS
dialog: Are you alright? You look terrible.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Yeah. Tough day all around.
speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS

dialog: morning... but...
speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS
dialog: Well, I am going to go back in to bed.
dialog: The alarm is on so don't try to break in.
dialog: (Sam smiles)
dialog: Well, you take care of yourself.
speaker_heading: SAM ROGERS
dialog: Is it alright if I finish up here?
speaker_heading: MARY ROGERS
dialog: Yes.
text: MARY walks back across the lawn into the house and turns off
text: the lights. SAM starts back in digging the ditch and starts
text: humming a song. He keeps digging as the song he is humming
text: then kicks in with the full version.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
