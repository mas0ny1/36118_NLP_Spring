scene_heading: EXT. MONK'S HOUSE (RODMELL, ENGLAND) - DAY
text: A river flows, not far from a small house in the Sussex
dialog: countryside.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: SUSSEX, ENGLAND. 1941.
text: It is the 28th of March, a desolate, gray morning, as a
text: woman of 59, very thin, in a huge overcoat with a fur
text: collar, comes out of the house and hurries across the
text: lawn. The edge of the lawn turns into a grassy, open
text: field as she carries on her way, moving quickly,
text: determinedly towards her destination.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER OUSE - DAY
text: The woman reaches an embankment and has to clamber down
text: to a brackish, mud-brown River Ouse. Her elegant,
text: unsuitable shoes stick in the mud. The woman is seen
text: more closely -- her face pale, fine, gaunt. As soon as
text: she gets to the river's edge she looks round for a
text: suitable stone. She sees one lying on the ground, the
text: size and shape of a pig's skull. She picks it up and
text: crams it a little clumsily into the pocket of her coat.
text: Then VIRGINIA WOOLF turns and without taking off her
text: shoes begins to wade out into the river.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. MONK'S HOUSE - DAY
text: LEONARD WOOLF is coming in from the garden on the other
text: side of the house. At this point, he is 61. He has
text: muddy corduroys and a pullover, the very picture of the
text: aging intellectual -- austere, ascetic with a fine
text: forehead and glasses. He comes distractedly into a small
text: hallway at the back of the house and starts taking off
text: his Wellington boots, unaware of anything wrong.
scene_heading: INT. MONK'S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - DAY
text: Two blue envelopes are propped up on the mantelpiece. In
text: handwriting, the single word "Leonard" is on one; the
text: single word "Vanessa" is on the other. LEONARD'S hand
text: reaches to lift his envelope, leaving the other where it
text: is. He stands, fearful. The sitting room of the house
text: is bohemian, casual, artistic, attractive. A YOUNG MAID
text: comes into the room, unaware of the drama that is about
text: to unfold.
speaker_heading: MAID
dialog: Are you ready for lunch, sir?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Not quite. Not just at the
dialog: moment.
text: The MAID goes out. LEONARD, still in his gardening
text: clothes, is tense as he opens the envelope. He unfolds
text: two blue pages. VIRGINIA WOOLF'S voice is hard as she
text: reads the letter.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA (V.O.)
dialog: Dearest, I feel certain that I am
dialog: going mad again. I feel we can't
dialog: go through another of these
dialog: terrible times. And I shan't
dialog: recover this time. I begin to
text: hear voices and can't concentrate.
dialog: So I am doing what seems the best
dialog: thing to do.
text: LEONARD looks up, alarmed, beginning to panic.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA (V.O.)
dialog: You have given me the greatest
dialog: possible happiness. You have been
dialog: in every way all that anyone could
dialog: be. I know that I am spoiling
dialog: your life, that without me you
dialog: could work. And you will, I know.
scene_heading: EXT. MONK'S HOUSE (RODMELL) - DAY
text: LEONARD runs back down to pull on his Wellington boots,
text: then runs out of the back room. He comes out of the
text: house and moves rapidly down the lawn. Terrified, he
text: begins to run as the river comes in sight. Meanwhile:
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA (V.O.)
dialog: You see, I can't write this
dialog: properly. I want to say is that I
dialog: owe all the happiness of my life
dialog: to you. You have been entirely
dialog: patient with me and incredibly
dialog: good. Everything has gone from me
dialog: but the certainty of your
dialog: goodness. I can't go on spoiling
dialog: your life any longer. I don't
dialog: think two people could have been
dialog: happier than we have been.
text: LEONARD has reached the edge of the river. He sees a
text: woman's footprints in the mud. He looks out across its
text: empty, flowing surface.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA (V.0O.)
dialog: Virginia.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER - DAY
text: At once the image of VIRGINIA WOOLF'S body, face down,
text: swirling fantastically like a Catherine wheel, back on
text: the surface of the water and carried along by the
text: current. Her hair is unloosed, her coat has billowed
text: out. Her body swirls, moving fast downstream, wildly
text: festooned like Ophelia, then comes to rest against an
text: underwater pillar and curls up like a baby as the water
text: catches the corpse against the stone. It is caught
text: against the stanchion of a bridge. Over the bridge, in
text: convoy, a line of Army trucks is passing, loaded with
text: soldiers in transit. The convoy passes over, ignorant of
text: the corpse beneath the bridge.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. THE BROWNS' HOUSE (LOS ANGELES) - DAWN
text: CREDIT SEQUENCE. Now a delivery truck moves down a
text: suburban street.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES. 1951.
text: The CREDITS BEGIN. It is only just past dawn as the
text: truck passes a car coming from the opposite direction.
text: The car approaches a one-level, small detached house,
text: which sits, secure, confident, a family image of post-war
text: America. The car draws up in the drive, and from it gets
text: out DAN BROWN, a sturdy, handsome American, just turning
text: 30. He wears suit trousers and a white open-neck shirt,
text: and he is carrying a bunch of white roses. He lets
text: himself in through the front door, and moves, roses in
text: hand, along past the sitting room with its pastel shades
text: and low, sparse furniture into the kitchen. As he
text: reaches for a vase, he looks towards the door of a
text: nearly-darkened bedroom which is open at the back of the
text: house. A few rays of light from the window help to pick
text: out shapes. In the bedroom LAURA BROWN, a few years
text: older than DAN, is lying asleep in the bed. She is
text: small, angular and fragile. She turns a moment in her
dialog: sleep.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGARTH HOUSE (RICHMOND) - DAWN (1923)
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: RICHMOND, ENGLAND. 1923.
text: A younger LEONARD WOOLF, only 43, is walking past the
text: church, carrying a newspaper and a pile of envelopes and
dialog: packages he has collected. This suburban quarter, a half
text: an hour away from London, is rich with flowers, lawns,
text: trees. In the other direction come the morning
text: COMMUTERS, dark-coated men, on their way to the station
text: to work. Beside the church is a big gray-stoned house,
text: its great face unmoving in the dawn.
dialog: 10
scene_heading: INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - HALL AND GALLERY - DAWN 9
text: LEONARD WOOLF opens the door of the house and goes into
text: the hall, which is lined with paintings. He puts down
text: the packages and paper and looks up in time to see a man
text: in his 60s, obviously a DOCTOR -- he carries a doctor's
text: bag and is in a dark coat -- coming down the stairs,
text: heading to have a word with him.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Ah, Doctor. Good morning.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Mr. Woolf. No worse, I think.
dialog: The main thing is to keep her
text: where she is, keep her calm.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Mmm. Friday then?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Friday.
text: Their conversation is left behind. Upstairs, on the
text: first floor, beyond the banisters of an open gallery, is
text: the room the DOCTOR has come out of. Inside the bedroom,
text: a woman is alone. She is lying chastely, blinds down at
text: the windows. She is the younger VIRGINIA WOOLF, now only
text: 41. She is staring up at the ceiling.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT (NEW YORK) - DAWN (2001) 10
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: NEW YORK CITY, 2001.
text: A SUBWAY TRAIN RATTLES violently PAST and a lone WOMAN is
text: left standing on the platform. At street level, the sun
text: is just about to rise down West 10th, one of the leafiest
dialog: and most pleasant streets in the Village. The woman,
text: SALLY LESTER, is walking quickly down the dawn street,
text: returning home. She is tall, dark, dynamic, in her late
text: 30s, wearing a leather jacket and jeans. She approaches
text: a high red-brick terraced house, goes up the steps and
text: lets herself in through its white-painted front door.
text: SALLY goes up to the first-floor apartment, which she
text: also unlocks. SALLY walks straight through the living
text: room of quiet, Bloomsbury-bourgeois homeliness --
text: terracotta and pine, clay post, ceramics, plants and
text: massive numbers of books. She goes down a corridor into
text: a warm-colored bedroom, light beginning to beat now
text: against large blinds. SALLY sheds clothes as she goes,
text: taking off her leather jacket and jeans, stripping down
text: to a T-shirt and knickers. She gets into the bed, does
text: nothing to wake the apparently sleeping figure beside
text: her. CLARISSA VAUGHAN is short of 50, tall, splendid
text: beside the smaller SALLY. CLARISSA does not react
text: visibly, but a moment after SALLY closes her eyes,
text: CLARISSA opens hers.

scene_heading: INT. MONTAGE - ALL OF THE ABOVE - ALL DAWN 11
text: 2001, 1951 and 1923. In MONTAGE, DAN BROWN stands in the
text: bedroom in front of the mirror, tying his tie. CLARISSA
text: throws back the sheet from the bed and gets up. She
text: comes into the small bathroom in her white night gown,
text: ties her hair back behind her head. LAURA, awake now,
text: reaches for a book which is lying at the side of her bed.
text: As her hand reaches for it, the title is clearly seen:
text: Mrs. Dalloway. VIRGINIA sits alone in her bedroom in her
text: dressing-gown, looking at herself in the mirror, then
text: lifts her fingers to adjust her hair. Water pours onto
text: CLARISSA'S face in the shower as she reaches her naked
text: arm out in front of her to grope for the tap, invisible
text: in steam. DAN sets out the breakfast things at the
text: kitchen table for three people,’ then goes and spoons
text: Nescafe for himself into a mug. He pours on hot water.
text: CLARISSA, in a robe, goes to fill her percolator from a
text: kitchen sink which is full of live crabs, in water.
text: VIRGINIA completes dressing, checks herself neatly in the
text: mirror, walks down the corridor and stands for a moment
text: at the top of the stairs, readying herself. CLARISSA
text: comes into her living room, stands in the middle with her
text: remote control and adjusts the lighting, then turns ON a
text: CLASSICAL RADIO STATION. LAURA arranges the pillows to
text: enjoy a luxurious few moments of reading. She turns to
text: listen for the sound of her husband in the kitchen.
text: In succession, the three women, suspended: VIRGINIA,
text: pausing, CLARISSA looking around satisfied with the
text: environment she has created, LAURA listening. Then one
text: thing disturbs CLARISSA: a bunch of sorry-looking dead
text: flowers in the corner of the room. She shakes her head
text: in irritation. DAN brings his roses from the sink and
text: puts the vase on the kitchen table. As he does so,
text: another vase is put down by a MAID'S hands, this time
text: with a bunch of blue cornflowers. As it goes down,
text: echoing the identical motion from 28 years later, the
scene_heading: CREDITS END.
scene_heading: INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - HALL AND GALLERY - DAY (1923) 12
text: The vase of cornflowers is seen to be on a table in the
text: open hall of Hogarth House. LEONARD WOOLF is sitting
text: eating toast, drinking coffee, and already proof-reading
text: a manuscript. He looks up at the sound of VIRGINIA
text: appearing from upstairs.

speaker_heading: LEONARD

text: VIRGINIA helps herself to tea from the table and nods at
dialog: the mail.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: That's all from this morning?
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Yes. This young man has submitted
dialog: his manuscript. I've found three
dialog: errors of fact and two spelling
dialog: mistakes and I'm not yet on page
dialog: four.
text: LEONARD is watching her all the time and sees that she is
text: not planning to sit down.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Have you had breakfast?
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Liar.
text: LEONARD'S tone is casual. He has the quiet, tactful
dialog: manner of a good nurse.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Virginia, it is not my insistence.
dialog: It's the wish of your doctors.
text: VIRGINIA just looks at him, not answering.
speaker_heading: LEONARD

speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Work, then. But then you must

scene_heading: INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - STUDY - DAY 13
text: VIRGINIA goes into her plain, serene study and sits down,
text: picking up a board on which she writes. There is an
text: inkwell, a fountain pen. She lights a cigarette. Then,
text: charged with quiet excitement, she opens a clean
text: notebook. The blank page. Then a feeling of pleasure
text: appears on her face in the hushed room. Before writing
text: she tries her sentence out loud.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy
dialog: the flowers herself.
scene_heading: INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - LOS ANGELES (1951) 14
text: LAURA is lying in the bed, luxuriating in a moment of

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: 'Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy
dialog: the flowers herself.'
scene_heading: INT. CLARISSA'S APARTMENT - NEW YORK (2001) 15

scene_heading: INT. BROWNS' HOUSE - DAY (1951) 17
text: A 5-year-old boy is watching as cereal is poured into a

text: his jacket neatly hung on the back of a chair.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: There you are, son. You're never
dialog: going to be a big boy if you don't

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Of course she is. Of course

dialog: needs her rest. Look. Here she
dialog: is.
text: And indeed, LAURA has now appeared in the doorway, the

scene_heading: INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT - DAY 27
text: At an upstairs window a MAN in a dressing gown parts his
text: curtain to look down at CLARISSA approaching.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. TRIANGLE BUILDING - DAY 28
text: CLARISSA, confident, cheerful, approaches a doorway
text: crammed between the metal criss-crossings of fire
text: escapes. She opens the door with a key and goes into a
text: tiny, squalid, airless lobby. A fluorescent panel
text: splutters on the ceiling. CLARISSA heads for the
text: cheerless graffiti-strewn freight elevator, closes the
text: gate and rides upward.
scene_heading: INT. RICHARD'S APARTMENT AND CORRIDOR - DAY 29
text: CLARISSA rings the bell of RICHARD'S apartment, then
text: presses her face close to the door to listen.

dialog: Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Yes, it's me.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (0.S.)
dialog: (inside)
dialog: Come in.
text: CLARISSA turns the lock with her own key and goes in to a
text: desolate loft space. The first space is in near
text: darkness, a gloomy kitchen-bathroom area. CLARISSA picks
text: her way carefully through to the second, larger space --
text: the living area -- where the man at the window is
text: sitting, pale, stick-limbed, in a rotting armchair which
text: is covered in towels. RICHARD is in his late 40s, gaunt
text: from AIDS, a noble skull merely, his boxer's nose and
text: high forehead lit by a streak of light from between the
text: blinds. He is wearing a blue robe with child-like
text: drawings of rockets and astronauts on it. The whole
text: place is bleached, chaotic, more or less bare of

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Is it still morning?
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: It is.
text: CLARISSA raises one of the shades. RICHARD barely moves
text: to greet the light.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Have I died? Am I alive?
text: CLARISSA bends over and kisses his forehead.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Good morning, my dear.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Any visitors?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Are they still here?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No. They've gone.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: How did they look?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Today? Sort of like black fire.
dialog: I mean, sort of light and dark at
dialog: the same time. There was one a
text: bit like an electrified jellyfish.
text: CLARISSA looks at him a moment, then picks up the
dialog: flowers.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
text: They were singing. It may have
dialog: been Greek.

dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: I saw three bluebirds on the way
dialog: over. Do you think it's a good
dialog: omen?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Do you believe in omens? Omens
dialog: would mean someone was looking
dialog: after us, someone was watching.
dialog: Do you believe anyone's watching?
dialog: Do they send signs?
text: RICHARD makes a sort of grin, amused at the idea.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I mean, I'd love to believe it.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: The ceremony's at five. Do you
dialog: Co remember?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Do I? Do I remember?
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
text: Then the party's after.
text: CLARISSA has arranged the flowers and now she reappears

text: His complex cocktail of pills is laid out neatly ona
text: table nearby.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: CLARISSA

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Of course it matters. You know
dialog: what the doctors say. Have you
dialog: been skipping pills?
text: CLARISSA is frowning mistrustfully at the way the

text: impatient, ignoring the question.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Clarissa, I can't take this.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Take what?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Having to be proud and brave in
text: front of everybody.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Honey, it's not a performance.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Of course it is. I got the prize
dialog: for my performance.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Well, that is nonsense.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I got the prize for having AIDS

text: RICHARD looks at her with an ironic gleam of doubt.
speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RICHARD

dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Are you sure? I remember the

speaker_heading: CLARISSA

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Ah, small party, is it? Select

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: CLARISSA

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Because I wanted to be a writer,
dialog: that's all.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: So?
text: RICHARD gets up, heaving himself across the room on a
dialog: crutch.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I wanted to write about it all.
dialog: Everything that's happening in a
dialog: moment. The way those flowers
dialog: looked when you carried them in
dialog: your arms -- this towel, how it
dialog: smells, how it feels -- this
dialog: thread -- all our feelings, yours
dialog: and mine. The history of who we

speaker_heading: CLARISSA

speaker_heading: NELLY

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA

speaker_heading: KITTY

speaker_heading: LAURA

speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: One morning. In Wellfleet. You

speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: All you're saying is, you were

text: CLARISSA smiles at JULIA'S remark. But JULIA knows it is

speaker_heading: CLARISSA

speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: I remember thinking: 'This is the
dialog: beginning of happiness.' That's
dialog: what I thought. 'So this is the
dialog: feeling. This is where it starts.
dialog: And of course there'll always be
dialog: more.' It never occurred to me:
dialog: it wasn't the beginning. It was
dialog: happiness. It was the moment,
dialog: right then.
text: There is a silence. JULIA looks thoughtfully at her

text: onions and being vigorously stirred, a pan of beef bones
text: bubbling next to it. NELLY and LOTTIE working together
text: in the well-lit kitchen, a whole range of vegetables laid
text: out on the chopping boards for supper.
text: NELLY, who misses nothing, looks up from her cooking at
text: the sound of someone coming downstairs. The kitchen door
text: is open and gives onto the stairway. A figure moves
text: quickly by, but NELLY sees. VIRGINIA is heading out in a
text: long coat. LOTTIE has also looked up, the two of them
text: noting VIRGINIA'S departure.
scene_heading: EXT. HOGARTH HOUSE - EVENING 72
text: VIRGINIA in her coat hurrying out, trying to make sure
text: she is not noticed. She moves quickly through the

text: the road outside.
scene_heading: EXT. RICHMOND STATION - EVENING 73
text: It is a summer evening, darkening a little, as VIRGINIA

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I need a ticket to London, please.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yes, madam. A single or a return?
scene_heading: INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - EVENING 74
text: In a presentiment of what will happen again in 18 years’

text: different house and a different hallway, but the action

scene_heading: INT. HOGARTH HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 75

speaker_heading: LEONARD

scene_heading: EXT. RICHMOND STATION - PLATFORM - EVENING 78
text: LEONARD comes down the steps towards the railway

text: by herself on a bench at the end of the platform. A
text: train has just gone, so there is not another traveler in
text: sight. The railway line stretches away to London, empty
text: and quiet. VIRGINIA is trying not to be self-conscious,
text: but she is tense. She turns.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Ah Mr. Woolf, what an unexpected
dialog: pleasure.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: And perhaps you could tell me
dialog: exactly what you think you're
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: What I was doing? Why --
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: I went to look for you and you
dialog: weren't there.
text: LEONARD moves towards her. VIRGINIA stays calm,
text: resisting his panic.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: You were working in the garden. I
dialog: didn't wish to disturb you.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: You disturb me when you disappear.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I didn't disappear. I went for a
dialog: walk.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: A walk? Is that all?
text: VIRGINIA doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Is that all? Just a walk?
text: They have neither of them moved. LEONARD is firm now.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
text: Virginia, Nelly is cooking dinner.

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: And what is your role, Leonard?
dialog: My husband? Or my prison guard?
text: LEONARD is shocked by her fierceness. He tries to soften
dialog: his tone,
text: but VIRGINIA flares up as soon as he speaks.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Virginia...
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I have endured this custody. I
dialog: have endured this imprisonment. I
dialog: am attended by doctors.
dialog: Everywhere I am attended by
dialog: doctors who inform me of my own
dialog: interests.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: They know your interests.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: They do not! They do not speak
dialog: for my interests! How dare they
dialog: presume? Let us imagine a life in
dialog: which women are the doctors, and
text: the men sit alone all day in
text: shuttered rooms in the suburbs.
dialog: Let us imagine that!
text: LEONARD shifts, but is still determined not to back down.
text: Behind him the odd PASSENGER is beginning to arrive to

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: No? Who, then, is a better judge?

text: VIRGINIA is looking at him defiantly.
speaker_heading: LEONARD

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Oh yes...
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: You came to Richmond with a
dialog: history of confinement. Fits.
text: Blackouts. Moods. Hearing
dialog: voices. We brought you here to
dialog: escape the irrevocable damage you
dialog: intended to yourself. Twice you
dialog: have tried to take your life by
dialog: your own hand.
text: VIRGINIA is watching him closely now, attending every
text: word, still not giving way.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: I live daily with that threat.
text: VIRGINIA looks at him, refusing to answer.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: I set up the press, we set up the
dialog: printing press...
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Not for itself. Not purely as a

speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: It was done for you! It was done
dialog: for your betterment! It was done
dialog: out of love. If I did not know
dialog: you better I would call this
dialog: ingratitude.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I am ungrateful? You call me
dialog: ungrateful?
text: VIRGINIA looks at him, accusing, shaking.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: My life has been stolen from me.
dialog: I am living in a town I have no
dialog: wish to live in. I am living a
dialog: life I have no wish to live. And
dialog: I am asking how this has occurred.
text: VIRGINIA nods, sure of her point. There are now several
text: PASSENGERS on the long London platform, but VIRGINIA and
text: LEONARD ignore them completely.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: It is time for us to move back to
dialog: London. I miss London. I miss
dialog: London life.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: This is not you speaking,
dialog: Virginia. This is an aspect of
dialog: your illness.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: It is me. It is my voice. It is
dialog: mine and mine alone.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: It is not your voice. It is only

dialog: brought you low.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: If I were thinking clearly?
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: We brought you to Richmond to give

text: VIRGINIA takes a moment to summon all her lucidity.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: If I were thinking clearly? If I
dialog: were thinking clearly, Leonard, I
dialog: would tell you that I wrestle
dialog: alone in the dark, and that only I
dialog: can know, only I can understand my
dialog: own condition. You live with the
dialog: threat, you tell me. You live
dialog: with the threat of my extinction.
text: There is silence. She is trembling, white.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Leonard, I live with it too.
text: Now it is LEONARD who cannot answer.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: This is my right. This is the
dialog: right of every human being. I
dialog: choose not the suffocating
dialog: anesthetic of the suburbs, but the
dialog: violent jolt of the capital. That
dialog: is my choice. The meanest
dialog: patient, yes even the very lowest,
dialog: is allowed some say in the matter

text: There are now tears in LEONARD'S eyes.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Very well. London, then. We
dialog: shall go back to London.
text: LEONARD bows his head, overwhelmed by the defeat of his
text: strategy. There is a silence. VIRGINIA watches, full of
text: feeling for him. Then, at the opposite platform the
text: train from London arrives. From its doors, phalanxes of
text: COMMUTERS in dark coats and hats get down onto the
text: platform and head for the exit. LEONARD looks up, wiping
text: away his tears.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: You must be hungry. I ama little
dialog: hungry myself.
text: VIRGINIA smiles. They look at each other, the issue at
text: last resolved between them.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Come along.
text: VIRGINIA and LEONARD get up and walk together along the
text: deserted platform, both shaken by the encounter. After a
text: moment, VIRGINIA takes his arm. They walk a while, arm
