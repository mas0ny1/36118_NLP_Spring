scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 2
scene_heading: INT. CARRIAGE. VAUXHALL STREETS. LONDON. DAY. 1
text: We see flashes of memory. A balloon in trouble. A man *
dialog: falling. *
text: Glints of sunlight through an ominous grey sky. *
text: AMELIA WREN, late 20s with a hazardous expression, sits
text: behind the window of a fast moving carriage. She’s looking up
text: at the sky - and there’s pain mirrored in her eyes. *
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Stop the carriage.
text: She bangs hard on the roof.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop the carriage.
text: The carriage is pulled to a stop.
scene_heading: EXT. VAUXHALL STREETS. LONDON. CONTINUOUS - 2
text: AMELIA gets out of the carriage - she tumbles out in her need
text: to dismount with speed. She stands on the dirty street. She
text: tries to recover her composure. ANTONIA, her caring sister,
text: gets out of the carriage behind her.
scene_heading: On-screen title: LONDON, 1862. *
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Amelia, are you quite well?
text: AMELIA looks at her.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t need to fly today. Return
dialog: to Richmond with me...
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Antonia, I just need a moment.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: With all you've been through... No-
dialog: one would think worse of you....
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I would. I would think worse of me. *
dialog: I made an agreement with Mr *
dialog: Glaisher. *
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: You barely know the man! And the *
dialog: *
dialog: little you do know, you’re
dialog: irritated by. *
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 3
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Antonia, please, just give me a
dialog: moment.
text: ANTONIA frowns and nods.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Last piece of sisterly advice -
dialog: doubt is there to be listened to.
text: She re-enters the carriage.
text: AMELIA looks up at the sky. She thinks. She lies back on the
text: pavement, she takes a moment.
text: A man walks by and tuts disapprovingly, but AMELIA doesn’t
text: care. She looks up, ever up, and then she smiles.
speaker_heading: TITLES OVER:
text: Behind AMELIA, in the back of shot, we see A BOY RUNNING
text: ALONG THE STREET.
scene_heading: EXT. VAUXHALL STREETS. LONDON. CONTINUOUS - 3
scene_heading: TITLES CONTINUE:
text: And now we’re with the 9 year old, a boot black in uniform,
text: as he runs, this is CHARLIE. He runs alongside dilapidated
text: slum terraced houses. He has a look of intensity on his face.
text: He approaches an intersection of busy streets. Filled with
text: carts, carriages, cows and horses. He runs straight across -
text: causing a carriage and a cart to take evasive action.
speaker_heading: COACHMAN
dialog: oi!
text: CHARLIE stops and turns, he dances this way and then dances
text: that. A smile on his face.
speaker_heading: COACHMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: You little...
text: CHARLIE runs on.
text: On the other side of the road, he runs alongside a long queue
text: of people beside a wooden fence.
text: He runs through and past them all. He sees what he’s looking
text: for - a big sign ‘HISTORY MADE. HERE. TODAY. HOW HIGH CAN
text: THEY GO?” Above the sign sits a painted picture of a gas
dialog: balloon.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 4
scene_heading: TICKET TOUT
text: The Widow Wren takes to the skies
dialog: to break the world record. Get your
dialog: tickets!
text: Next to the sign is a tall hedgerow. CHARLIE checks that he’s
text: not being watched, and then he ducks down through a gap in
text: the hedge, pushes through a hole in the fence behind, and
text: sneaks into the Gardens.
scene_heading: EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS. CONTINUOUS - 4
scene_heading: TITLES CONTINUE:
text: Everywhere there are hordes of people - all moving in one
text: direction. There’s an air of anticipation and the chatter of
dialog: excitement.
text: CHARLIE weaves and dodges, passing food sellers,
text: Waveswingers, Revolving Chairs and Merry-Go-Rounds - stalls
dialog: and entertainment all put on to make the most of the occasion
text: (and maximize the money taken). But CHARLIE runs through it
dialog: all, determined.
text: Until he gets to the only thing he wants to see - the only
text: thing everyone wants to see - he looks up in awe towards:
text: An enormous red and white striped, silk air balloon. Bigger,
text: better, bolder than the picture on the sign.
text: 93,000 cubic feet, 80 feet tall, and 55 feet wide, covered in
text: a vast rope webbing... It towers over the top of the fair.
dialog: This is the MAMMOTH. It is unlike any gas balloon you’ve
dialog: seen. And it is magnificent.
text: Charlie’s mouth gapes open, and then he smiles.
speaker_heading: THE AERONAUTS
text: And we travel past CHARLIE, towards the balloon, it rests at
text: the centre of an amphitheatre type structure, filled with the
text: VAST CROWDS that have gathered to see the balloon rise.
text: Around the circumference of the balloon, 16 men hold guide
text: ropes to keep the Mammoth in place, with further ropes tied
text: to stakes in the earth. The basket has a temporary platform
text: surrounding it.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 5
scene_heading: EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS. CONTINUOUS 4A
text: We settle on a man in the basket of the balloon stowing a
text: series of instruments and trying to ignore the fact that he
text: is at the centre of all the attention. This is JAMES
text: GLAISHER, 35, a man whose forensic attention to detail belies
text: the adventurer within.
text: He looks at his pocket watch, irritated, and then checks and
text: rechecks that the bindings on one of his barometers are
text: securely fastened - a job he’s clearly done a hundred times
dialog: already this morning.
text: Another man, JOHN TREW, bookish and loyal, ascends the
text: temporary wooden steps to the platform.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
text: She's late.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: She is, but that is the least of
dialog: your problems.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: We'll lose the light...
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: James, do the clouds not look
dialog: ominous to you?
text: But JAMES doesn’t look at the clouds, he’s consumed, he
text: climbs out of the basket and checks his watch.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I repeatedly explained the
dialog: importance of catching the right
text: light and the right wind at the
dialog: right time and -
text: JAMES turns to his bag, he begins to check further
text: instruments inside. Amongst them we see a compass, two
text: thermometers (a “dry” and a “wet” one, which is wrapped in a
text: muslin and submerged in water), a spectroscope, a magnet, a
text: barometer, and a hygrometer.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: James. Look up.
text: JAMES looks up. He sees the dark clouds, he frowns.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Not a concern, John, the readings I
dialog: took this morning were quite clear
dialog: that...
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019
text: He bends to another basket. He puts some feed into it.
text: pigeons inside coo appreciatively.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: Far be it from me to doubt you, but
dialog: your weather predictions have been
dialog: wrong in the past and it’s just
dialog: possible...
speaker_heading: NED (0.S.)
dialog: Don’t even think of it.
dialog: The
text: NED is a tall bald man with a dour face. JAMES looks at him
text: and smiles to mask a grimace.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Ned Chambers, John Trew, my very
dialog: good friend. John this is Ned, one
dialog: of the hardy entrepreneurs who has
dialog: invested in our expedition -
text: JOHN leans down from the platform to shake NED’s hand. But
text: NED pays him no attention, he ascends the stairs to the
text: platform, looming over JAMES ominously.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Don’t even think of telling me
dialog: flight is not possible.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: Mr Chambers, we are scientists of
dialog: the air, and we can tell you the
dialog: one thing no-one can control is -
dialog: well - the air -
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I have paid for gas, I have paid
dialog: for silk - and is this balloon not
dialog: the strongest and largest that’s
dialog: ever been?
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: But even so it can’t fight the
dialog: weather, you do not want to be
dialog: responsible for a tragedy, Sir.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: I don’t wish to be responsible for
dialog: refunding the ten thousand who've
dialog: come here ‘cause you promised them
dialog: history and -—
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: We'll fly, Ned. We’ll fly.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 7
text: JOHN TREW looks at his friend concerned, NED smiles. JAMES
text: GLAISHER meets eyes with NED.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: We only need the sky to hold for
dialog: ninety minutes - once we’re above
dialog: the cloud line, it will be fine.
speaker_heading: NED
dialog: Good. That's fixed. Now - did you
dialog: not promise me a five o’clock
dialog: ascent?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I did. I am merely waiting for the
dialog: pilot. It’s not the first time
dialog: she's kept me waiting.
text: NED smiles and walks away through the crowds. JAMES watches
text: him go and then looks up anxiously at the clouds.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: What a truly pleasant man -
text: JAMES - deliberately not looking up - starts to load a series
text: of sample jars into the balloon, wrapping each one in cotton
text: and then placing them into the case.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: One must make compromises in order
dialog: to achieve greatness my friend....
text: He hears a ROAR from the crowds, he turns towards it, as does
speaker_heading: JAMES.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: And he’s merely one compromise.
scene_heading: EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS. CONTINUOUS - 5
text: Fast approaching, standing on top of a carriage drawn by 4
text: horses - getting cheers from all sides - AMELIA is now
text: resplendent in a dress festooned with feathers. It’s a
dialog: complete transformation from the woman we saw earlier, the
text: woman almost cowed by the world is now wild and fabulous. She
text: has the crowd in the palm of her hand and has a look of utter
text: delight on her face.
text: As the carriage pulls alongside the balloon, one of the men
text: holding the ropes passes one to her. She SWINGS from it onto
text: the rostrum. She does a cartwheel on landing, and turns that
text: cartwheel into a flip. She lands, and presents to the crowd.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: You're incredibly late.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 8
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Lesson number one of Aeronauting-
dialog: we are creatures of the skies and
dialog: have no respect for landlocked
dialog: clocks.
text: She walks around to the steps leading to the basket, and
text: speaks loud enough for everyone to hear her.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Glaisher, are you really not a
dialog: gentlemen at all? Hold out your
dialog: hand to me.
text: JAMES holds out his hand. She takes it. And then she tumbles
text: from the steps into his arms.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Naughty.
text: The crowd cheers.
text: NED pushes through the crowd to see her, AMELIA smiles at him
text: beguilingly.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Are you ready?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Mr Glaisher, you have no conception
dialog: of how ready I am.
text: NED smiles at her shyly. She gets into the basket with a
text: flourish, and then waves to the crowds. She whistles -
scene_heading: EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS. CONTINUOUS 5A
text: - and jumping from the carriage window comes a dog in a small
text: coat. She holds out her hands, he jumps into her arms.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: No. Absolutely not. Under no
dialog: circumstances are we taking a dog.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I told you we’d need to put ona
dialog: show for takeoff, and the crowd
dialog: prefers my dog to your boxes.
text: She indicates the scientific instruments being loaded into
dialog: the balloon.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: These are essential meteorological
dialog: instruments.
dialog: *
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 9
text: AMELIA makes eyes at one of the men holding the balloon down,
text: they nod at her authoritatively, she nods back.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: And this is an essential dog. She’s
dialog: called Posey. The essential Posey.
text: She puts Posey down, and he enters the basket through a
text: little opening in the side.
text: The crowd cheer. JAMES grimaces.
text: She pulls herself from his arms onto the edge of the balloon.
text: She balances along the edge, all nimble beautiful energy. She
text: raises her hands in the air. The crowd whoop. She is
text: astonishing. She raises her hands again for silence.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen. Today myself -
dialog: Amelia Wren - my naughty scientist
dialog: Mr. Glaisher - and my wonder dog
dialog: Posey - are going to change the
dialog: world. Are you ready for us to do
dialog: so?
text: There are loud cheers.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: This balloon on which I stand - the
dialog: Mammoth - is a balloon like no
dialog: other and will allow us to ascend
dialog: higher into the air than any man or
dialog: woman has ever gone.
text: She raises her hands in the air. The crowd laugh and cheer
text: again. She looks out in the crowd and sees a man she
text: recognises: PIERRE. She looks at him a moment and then
dialog: controls herself.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
text: The French rose to 23,000 feet.
dialog: Today, we will break their record
dialog: and reclaim it for these fair
dialog: shores. Who knows, we may reach the
dialog: moon and bring back star dust!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Today is a day when history will be
dialog: made - and you will all be part of
dialog: it.
dialog: (to Glaisher)
dialog: Mr Glaisher, now’s your moment. Up
dialog: you get.
text: There are yet more cheers. AMELIA pulls JAMES upwards, so he
text: too balances on the basket. AMELIA raises both her hands into
text: the air. On cue, FIREWORKS go off around the park.
dialog: *
speaker_heading: 5B
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 10
text: Brilliant sparkling eruptions of colour surround the
text: amphitheatre. The crowd ROAR.
scene_heading: EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS. CONTINUOUS 5B
text: JAMES looks around at them all - a bemused smile on his face -
text: whilst AMELIA quickly and efficiently checks the rigging and
text: valves surrounding the basket.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Fireworks?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Are you ready?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I just need to retake my ground
text: readings and then a final check of
dialog: the equipment....
text: She counts the sand bags, she checks the appendix and finally
text: she checks the valve line. She’s fast, precise and
dialog: magnificently efficient.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Well, my equipment was all prepared
dialog: in advance. Now, don’t touch that
dialog: rope, Mr Glaisher - it’1ll let out
dialog: the gas.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I do know how a balloon works.
text: She signals to the men on the ground - who let go of the
text: ropes and kick out the stakes.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: We fly.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Ground readings are essential - if
dialog: they’re not accurate, then
dialog: everything I take from now on -
text: The balloon rises up. JAMES looks around, slightly
text: bewildered, he starts desperately to take temperature and
dialog: pressure readings.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
text: The sky awaits.
text: AMELIA takes a handful of sand and deposits it off the side
text: of the balloon which falls to the floor beneath.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 11
text: There’s a moment of stasis and then - with a jerk and a creak
text: or two - the balloon begins to rise up. Slowly at first, but
text: with gathering speed. It’s majestic.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: God speed, old man.
text: JOHN TREW calls up to the basket. But JAMES GLAISHER doesn’t
text: even notice him, he’s too intent on getting his notations
dialog: down.
text: The crowd watch in wonderment as the Mammoth silently
text: ascends. Amongst them we pick out the face of CHARLIE.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS. CONTINUOUS - 6
text: 400ft. Rising 400ft/min. 25C / 77F
text: AMELIA has a business-like air that we haven’t seen before.
text: She pulls herself up onto the netting on the side of the
dialog: balloon.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Giving the people their money's
dialog: worth.
text: She leans out and waves, the crowd cheer. The balloon rises
text: to sixty feet and then a hundred. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE watch
text: from below, all with their faces turned upward to the sky.
text: She climbs further up the side of the balloon.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Won’t you damage the integrity of
dialog: the balloon?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Perhaps.
text: She pulls a cord on the side of her dress and the feathers
text: fall from it from all sides leaving her half the size.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: I LOVE YOU ALL.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: This is insane.
text: The feathers twinkle down in the wind, and are gathered
text: enthusiastically by the crowd below.
text: She leans out further, keeping good hold of the netting as
text: she does, but she leans too far, she loses her grip, and she
dialog: suddenly SLIPS -
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 12
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
text: She SCREAMS - and then spins athletically around the hoop and
text: smiles. The crowd cheer below.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: For God's sake.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: It’s what they call entertainment,
dialog: Mr Glaisher.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Well, I’m not finding it
dialog: particularly entertaining.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Yes, it requires a sense of humour.
dialog: Which you seem to..lack.
text: She hangs nonchalantly in the air, her arms outstretched,
text: welcoming the applause, her smile wider still.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, don’t look so sour. The dog.
dialog: Give me the dog.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: What do you mean give you the dog?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Pass me Posey, Mr. Glaisher.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I’m not handing you the dog.
text: JAMES wrestles with this notion.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Posey, now. Before we lose them.
text: He scrabbles around in the basket for the dog.
text: Eventually he’s able to grab POSEY and passes the dog up to
text: her. But as he does, she lets POSEY slip from her grasp.
text: She screams and he hollers out in astonishment - as the dog
text: plummets past him, falling towards the earth with a yelp, she
text: looks down after it - anguished - and then the dog’s
text: parachute opens.
dialog: A parachute?
text: The crowd cheer ever louder. She smiles.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 13
text: She spins round on the hoop and kisses the air extravagantly.
text: JAMES looks at her - unsure what has happened here, but sure
dialog: he doesn’t like it.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, well done Posey! Well done.
text: She watches as POSEY is caught in NED’s arms below and then
text: breathes in a tremendous breath, she is high on exhilaration. *
text: She sees JAMES looking up at her. *
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr Glaisher, you are airborne for
dialog: the first time in your life, I
dialog: suggest you spend less time
text: frowning at me and more taking in
dialog: the world we’ve just left.
text: JAMES looks down and suddenly it seems all of London is laid
text: out below.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. SKY OVER LONDON. CONTINUOUS - 7
text: 1,200ft. Rising 400ft/min. 23C / 73F

dialog: astonishment.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Quite something isn’t she? London.
dialog: When we’re further up, we’ll be
dialog: able to see across to Windsor and
dialog: down to Brighton. With current
dialog: bearing, we should end up somewhere
dialog: south of Canterbury. But anything
dialog: is possible in this weather.
speaker_heading: +H HK
text: JAMES says nothing. AMELIA looks at him a moment more and
text: then is a hive of energy balancing their equipment. From
text: entertainer to businesswoman in two short breaths.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: It all looks so -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Insignificant?
text: With one final look down, she pulls herself down to the
text: basket, flashes him a smile and then turns back to her
dialog: equipment.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Do you take anything seriously?
text: JAMES shakes his head.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 14
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Those people gathered to see an act
dialog: of science, to witness us break the
dialog: height record, they didn’t need to
text: see a flying dog.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Still stuck there, are you?
text: AMELIA pulls her sleeves down and starts to take her make-up
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I have spent much of my life being
dialog: laughed at for what I do Miss Wren,
dialog: I did hope today of all days might
dialog: prove an exception.
text: He returns to his books. She watches him carefully.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Tell me, what determines your
dialog: reputation?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: My reputation?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Your standing in the scientific
dialog: community?
text: JAMES frowns, considering sincerely.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I am aware what reputation means.
dialog: The papers I’ve written, the
dialog: discoveries I’ve uncovered.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Your reputation is built on paper.
dialog: My reputation is built on screams.
dialog: Those people below came to be
dialog: entertained. And they - if you
dialog: didn’t know - are the ones paying
dialog: for this trip.
text: JAMES looks at her, then shakes his head, as he takes a pair
text: of opera-glasses out of a pocket in the side of the basket.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Off to the opera?
text: He ignores her and uses the glasses to look up at the sky -
text: the darkening clouds - he frowns, but then dismisses his
dialog: worry.

dialog: Don’t try and pretend that cloud
dialog: isn’t a concern.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I am the scientist. You’re the

text: A younger JAMES GLAISHER is climbing fast up a sloping roof,

speaker_heading: TREW.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
text: JAMES. James.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I will not miss this, John.
text: JAMES opens a window, climbs out of it and is gone.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: For God's sake.
text: JOHN makes a face to himself. And then cursing his better
text: nature, crawls up the roof after his friend.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW (CONT’D)
dialog: It is in the air, we could have
text: stayed on the ground and looked up.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: We must see it from the best
text: vantage point, Johnny.
text: JAMES pulls himself onto the roof.
text: JOHN a few windows behind him, with one more despairing look
text: to the ground, pulls himself after.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENWICH OBSERVATORY. ROOF. DAY 10
text: JOHN lies flat on the roof, panting deeply.
text: Bells can be heard striking in the distance. JAMES turns
text: towards them with a smile.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 16
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: The sky is clear. I predict a clean
dialog: take-off. Which means in precisely
dialog: sixteen seconds precisely we should
dialog: see....
text: JAMES unpacks his shoulder bag - revealing within it a large
text: telescope and then a stand to place it upon.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: You are aware he might not get off
dialog: the ground?
text: He fits the telescope into the stand.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Charles Green will get it off the
dialog: ground.
text: He moves the stand to the very edge of the building. JOHN
text: sees plaster crumble away.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: Maybe not quite so close to the
text: edge of the building.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: John, stop scowling at me. Do I

speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: It could be anything. The gas valve
dialog: ruptured, the silk tore -
text: JAMES smiles as suddenly - clear as a day across London, a

text: JAMES looks at JOHN with the largest of smiles.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
text: He has rethought his balloon shape.

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Mr Trew, if you’ve had time
dialog: enough...
text: JOHN steps away with a smile, JAMES retakes his perch.
text: And then thinks and then lifts the equipment and repositions

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: We know more now about the world

dialog: in history, but still we are
dialog: limited by our ignorance as to what
dialog: is truly above us. With the
dialog: progress we have made in balloon
dialog: travel here at the Society,
dialog: pioneered by Charles Green, we

text: Laughter breaks out again.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: No sir, I want funding for my own

speaker_heading: CHARLES GREEN
dialog: We are scientists, not fortune
dialog: tellers! You talk of weather
dialog: prediction.
text: There’s laughter. JAMES rides over it.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Is that not our responsibility as

dialog: chaos...
scene_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D) CHARLES GREEN
dialog: - if we can understand what’s - you are no closer to

text: JAMES, still in his wool suit, continues to take his

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: You should put on your oilskins, Mr
dialog: Glaisher.
text: Ignoring her, he writes something on a piece of paper.

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you attaching to those

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Our readings.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Spenser. The Fate of the Butterfly.
dialog: One of my favourite poems.
text: AMELIA swallows, dealing with her complicated emotions.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I’m not sure he'd have liked you.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: He disliked people who studied
dialog: rather than practiced.
text: JAMES takes the dig as he reaches out and feels the air on
text: his fingers. A roll of THUNDER.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 22
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: We are still sure this weather will
dialog: hold - because my instinct tells me
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Instinct has no place in weather
dialog: prediction.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: - that you’re lying to me.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Every reading I took this morning -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: And there are no advantages in
dialog: concealing concerns - we’re trapped
dialog: here no matter what you say.
text: JAMES thinks and then looks at her. He looks back at his
dialog: measuring apparatus.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: The air pressure is - changing
dialog: faster than I anticipated.
text: There is a flash of LIGHTNING - AMELIA turns towards it as
text: JAMES scans the sky - truly concerned now.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Your readings were wrong. We are
text: about to get wet.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Quiet.
text: He holds out a hand. He’s listening for something else. We
text: wait with him - the silence is powerful and oppressive.
text: AMELIA looks at her hands. Moisture is clinging to her
text: gloves. There is another rumble of THUNDER.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: You're discerning how close we are
dialog: to the storm.
text: JAMES says nothing - clearly panicked, he turns to his
text: equipment and consults numbers in his book. Suddenly the
text: balloon JOLTS. The balloonists grab the side of the basket.
text: Then there is calm again. AMELIA looks to the West and the
text: East. She smiles.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: And so it begins.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 23
scene_heading: EXT. SKY. CONTINUOUS -— 13
text: We’re in a pocket amongst the cumulonimbus clouds. We linger
text: on the churning sky.
text: Lightning illuminates hidden crevices. A rapidly shifting
text: and darkening landscape.
text: We see moving through it - the Mammoth.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. CLOUDS. CONTINUOUS - 14
text: 7,200ft. Rising 400ft/min. 10C / 50F
text: And then we’re back inside the balloon. JAMES is taking
dialog: readings.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: We need to batten down.
text: He takes out his Spectroscope. He twirls it around. He makes
dialog: notes in his book.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m not sure your instruments are
dialog: much use to us now.
text: JAMES looks at her, and then checks the hygrometer.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: There are no prizes for obstinacy.
dialog: James —
speaker_heading: THUNDER.
text: They both turn towards it.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: If you won’t listen to me. Listen
dialog: to that.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Not one of my readings suggested a
dialog: storm -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Well that’s what it is, and we’re
text: inside a cumulo, which is precisely
dialog: where we shouldn’t be.
text: He takes more readings. He’s more skittery now, less focused.
text: She sees another flash of LIGHTNING. A roll of THUNDER only
text: seconds later.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 24
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Don’t worry, The Mammoth is not
dialog: made of conductive material - we
dialog: won't attract lightning.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: And if we do, the gas keeping us
dialog: afloat is fifty per cent hydrogen,
dialog: thirty-five percent methane, so we
dialog: won’t live long enough for me to
dialog: point out how wrong you were...
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. STORM. CONTINUOUS - 15
text: 7,600ft. Speed of ascent constantly changing. 9C / 48F
text: Suddenly both balloonists are THROWN to the floor, an
text: agitation in the air causes a WHIRLWIND - which turns the
text: giant balloon three times from the right to the left.
text: There is another SMASH OF LIGHTNING closer to the balloon
text: this time, and with it comes the RAIN.
text: Rain which lashes down and which seems to suggest worse.
text: JAMES returns to his instrumentation, writing down a series
dialog: of readings.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Get that equipment put away now -
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: The equipment will give us the
dialog: information we need to survive this
text: They are THROWN again, violently this time, horrifically this
text: time. JAMES is slammed into the side of the basket.
text: AMELIA hauls him to the floor and uses her legs to pincer him
dialog: into position -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Stay still and keep calm - I need
dialog: to get us out of here.
text: And then they are THROWN again - and this time JAMES is
text: thrown on top of AMELIA, smashing his head on the pigeon box
text: in the process. BLOOD pours from the wound.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: We cannot descend - this may be our
dialog: one and only opportunity -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Of course we don’t descend.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 25
text: JAMES looks at her, shocked.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: We don’t?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: There are two ways to break a
dialog: storm. One is to travel beneath it,
dialog: the other - to travel above it. The
dialog: safest way is up.
text: Another fork of LIGHTNING STRIKES.
text: The THUNDER ROARS immediately afterwards.
text: AMELIA looks across at JAMES - a smile spreads across his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: The safest way is up?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Who did you think you got ina
dialog: balloon with?
text: AMELIA smiles and then pulls off her wet and slippy gloves
text: and grabs a knife from her small bag and leans over the side
text: of the balloon - seemingly immune to the raging storm - to
text: slice off some bags of ballast.
scene_heading: EXT. STORM. CONTINUOUS - 16
text: 9,000ft. Falling 4000ft/min, then rising 600ft/min. 7C / 44F
text: Then the balloonists hit a pocket of cold air and the balloon
text: suddenly DROPS 1000 FEET.
text: This has the effect of sending AMELIA and JAMES and
text: everything that isn’t bound to the basket of the balloon up
text: in the air. JAMES’s leg hits the underside of the table on
text: his way up, BREAKING IT and sending his equipment everywhere.
text: We watch almost in slow motion the detritus float away - her
text: gloves arcing gracefully out of the balloon and away.
text: AMELIA and JAMES hit the underside of the balloon, bounce
text: off, and fall back towards the basket again.
text: JAMES lands HARD in the basket, but AMELIA misses the basket,
text: clawing desperately at the wicker as she does. JAMES looks
text: for her but everything is obscured by the mist. He’s blind.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Amelia! Amelia.
text: AMELIA’s legs dangle helplessly in space. She clings to the
text: rope that holds the grapnel, the rain LASHING around her.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 26
text: The mist clears and her perilous position becomes very clear.
text: She's on the verge of oblivion. Then the mist returns and the
text: blindness is intoxicating.
text: JAMES grabs a central rope and reaches out a hand -
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Take my hand. Take my hand.
text: He grabs at one of the toggled ropes holding the basket to
text: the hoop, but in quick succession three of the TOGGLES SNAP
text: and the balloon is massively destabilized, everything tumbles
text: towards him as the basket falls into a slant. This loosens
text: AMELIA’s grip and she falls further. Screaming as she does.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I can’t - I can’t get...
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
text: Hold on. HOLD ON.
text: He grabs another rope, then quickly ties a rope around his
text: waist and secures the other end to the hoop above his head.
text: He steels himself - overcomes his fear - and leans out.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: On three. One. Two.
text: They grab hands.
text: They dangle for a moment, him holding her as firmly as he
dialog: can.
text: And then he starts heaving her back into the balloon. She
text: scrabbles up, gets a foothold. It’s hard.
text: The rain continues to lash their faces. AMELIA manoeuvres her
dialog: way upwards.
text: She lands beside him in the bottom of the basket, both
text: BREATHING DEEPLY.
scene_heading: EXT. STORM. CONTINUOUS - 17
dialog: 9,600ft. Rising 600ft/min, then 1000ft/min. 5c / 41F
text: As the storm buffets around them, AMELIA pulls a ROPE next to
text: JAMES, releasing a sandbag which plummets into the cloud.
text: She pulls another ROPE on her side of the basket: another bag
text: of ballast FALLS.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Hold tight, it’s not over yet.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 27
text: They look at each other, clinging on for dear life, as the
text: storm rages around them.
text: There’s a particularly large JOLT and then there’s silence.
text: They both breathe out. The grey mist surrounding them begins
text: to brighten as we start to get wispy definition in the
text: clouds.
text: Then, almost magically, sunlight pours into the basket. They
text: both smile as a golden-tinged blue starts to emerge.
text: A calmness floods both over them and the balloon.
text: AMELIA unties the rope, and they both lie there a little
text: more. Then JAMES stumbles to his feet and looks out.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. ABOVE THE CLOUDS. CONTINUOUS - 18
text: 11,500ft. Rising 1000ft/min. 3C / 37F
text: The basket is tilting at a desperate angle. But the sky - the
text: sky bears no scar of what they have just been through. He
text: looks down at the storm, and then up at the tranquil air.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: We rose above it.
text: AMELIA gets to her feet slowly, she looks around herself. She
text: looks at the dripping wet balloon, ropes and at the wet prone
dialog: basket.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Well. We mostly did. This is one
text: broken bird.
text: She looks at him, she smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. VAUXHALL PLEASURE GARDENS. DAY 29
text: JOHN TREW stands looking through a telescope. He thinks,
text: frowns, and puts the telescope away. CHARLIE approaches.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: May I look through your spyglass
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: There’s nothing to see. I lost them
dialog: when the storm passed over.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I would like a look all the same
dialog: Sir.
text: JOHN looks him up and down.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 28
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I won't steal it.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: I didn’t presume you would. You
dialog: have interest in the air?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don’t you wish to be up there with
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: I'd be an unnecessary weight.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: All the same...
text: A look of intense sincerity passes across JOHN TREW’s face.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
text: Some reach for the stars, and some

text: CHARLIE looks at him like he thinks he’s mad.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I wish I was up there.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: And you're not afraid of the

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Clouds are just water.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: What about the birds that may
dialog: attack you?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: May I look through your eye glass?
text: JOHN TREW smiles, he pulls the eye glass out.
text: We look upwards. Lurching this way and that with CHARLIE’s
dialog: eyes.
dialog: We twitch this way and that - looking for something -
text: anything - and then we see something - a speck -
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: I can see them, Sir.
text: JOHN TREW looks over, surprised.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: Not possible.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 29
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I can see them Sir, I can.
text: CHARLIE hollers with joy as we ascend quickly towards a speck
text: that becomes a balloon that becomes the Mammoth.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. ABOVE THE CLOUDS. DAY. 21
text: 13,500ft. Rising 350ft/min. 1C / 34F
text: And we're back in the balloon and looking down, a magnificent
text: sea of cloud lies beneath it, its surface being varied with
text: endless hills, hillocks, mountain chains and many snow white
text: masses rising from it. Towering pillars of Cumulonimbus rise
text: upwards to the heavens all around them. The balloon is
text: dwarfed by the enormity of the cloudscape.
text: The thunder, now far below them, rumbles beneath the car.
text: JAMES and the equipment are now on the other side of the
text: basket, trying to rebalance and re-angle the basket. AMELIA
text: is above him, perilously balancing on the edge of the
text: balloon, lashing a rope from the basket to the hoop in order
text: to re-engineer the broken toggle.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Now pull hard. Hold it. There.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: There?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: There. I believe we’ve - done it.
text: She looks at it.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: It should keep.
text: She smiles. She bangs on the hoop.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
text: Stronger than she looks.
text: She stays on the edge of the basket. She looks out, a strange
text: smile on her face. JAMES immediately busies himself resetting
dialog: his equipment.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr Glaisher.
text: We pull up to see JAMES collecting readings.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: James. You will miss it.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 30
text: She indicates an aureole - a full-circle rainbow to their
dialog: East.
text: JAMES turns.
text: A myriad of colours that glitters in the light.
text: It’s mesmeric.
text: And reflected in the centre of it, the Mammoth.
text: A ghost balloon with a multi-colored halo.
text: A dazzling sight.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: (awed)
dialog: An Aureole. Have you...ever seen
dialog: one?
text: AMELIA nods.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: You haven't.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Only in books.
text: JAMES reaches out almost to touch it. She smiles to see his
text: glee. There’s a long moment of silence.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I believe you should be checking
dialog: your instruments, Mr Glaisher. You
dialog: can’t have taken a good reading in
dialog: quite some time.
text: JAMES looks at the full-circle rainbow. And then back at her.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: You do so enjoy being amused by me.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I am amused by your enjoyment of
dialog: something that has nothing to do
dialog: with numbers.
text: JAMES looks out, he smiles. And then he looks down.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Have you noticed? It’s completely
dialog: silent.
text: There’s a silence. Then JAMES raises his hands in the air and
text: HOLLERS LOUDLY. AMELIA laughs.
dialog: 23
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 31
text: He raises his hands and HOLLERS again.
text: JAMES takes a deep breath in.
text: He stands swaying a moment. He HOLLERS a third time.
text: She thinks and then HOLLERS herself.
text: The two look at each other and smile.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Cloud ahoy.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. CLOUD COLUMN. CONTINUOUS - 23
dialog: 15,250ft. Rising 350ft/min. -2C / 29F
text: The balloon drifts into the upper section of one of the large
text: cumulonimbus columns. They’re surrounded by mist again.
text: And then there’s the sound of a church bell. AMELIA looks
text: around - as if searching for it.
text: Then we hear whispers of voices that transfigure into workmen
text: calling to each other.
text: As if by magic, we are surrounded by the crystal clear sounds
text: of a London street. It’s as if we’re right there.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Would you listen to that?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: But that sounds like -
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Horses. Bells. People. It is the
text: sound of the streets.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: We have flown through a storm and
dialog: still London follows us.
text: JAMES checks his instruments. A look of delight on his face.
text: He doesn’t see AMELIA’s discombobulation. One voice pierces
dialog: through the others.
speaker_heading: PIERRE (0.S.)
dialog: Thank you for giving me somewhere I
dialog: belonged.
text: AMELIA looks down as if desperately searching for it.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)

text: There is a loud knocking at the door.
text: She ignores it, until it suddenly opens.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I didn’t lock it.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: No. You did not.
text: AMELIA turns and looks at ANTONIA. They look similar. They’re
dialog: sisters.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not dressed.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: And yet I am wearing clothes.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: When was the last time you changed
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: You break down my door to tell me
dialog: to wash?
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: When was the last time you opened
dialog: any curtains?
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 33
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Sunlight ages - I want my

speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Which ones are glowing? The ones
dialog: with your food upon them or the
dialog: ones covered in dirty clothing?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I do not need to see it to know
dialog: it’s there.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Well, much as you might enjoy your
dialog: self-pity, I am not here to freshen
dialog: anything. Phillip has invited us to
dialog: a small gathering -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: No.
text: ANTONIA picks up a glass, she sniffs it. She recoils.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Amelia....
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I do so hate how you say my name.
dialog: Like a priest imploring me to
dialog: confess my sins.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: It’s been two years.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: And that’s time enough?
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Do you think Pierre would have
dialog: wanted this?
text: AMELIA turns and looks at her.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: That is beneath even you.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: (imploring)
dialog: I‘1l help you change. Come. Sisters
dialog: together. And then I’11 let you

scene_heading: 25 INT. ELEGANT HOUSE. NIGHT. 25
text: AMELIA stands in the middle of a floor.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 34
text: Around her moves society. And it does seem like all of
text: society is here. The finest gowns, the fiercest laughter, the
dialog: tinkliest conversation.
text: AMELIA looks swallowed up within it.
speaker_heading: AUNT FRANCES
dialog: Your sister is proud as punch she
dialog: pulled you here.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Hello, Auntie.
speaker_heading: AUNT FRANCES
text: She keeps trying to persuade men to
dialog: take you onto the floor.
text: POPPY walks past them both, a chiselled man either side of
text: her, hanging on her every word, she turns and grins at
text: AMELIA, who looks back.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: And they refuse her?
speaker_heading: AUNT FRANCES
dialog: I think they’re intimidated by you.
text: AUNT FRANCES indicates, ANTONIA is talking to a young man, he
text: looks over at AMELIA, and then looks away - blushing as he
text: does. AMELIA laughs.
speaker_heading: AUNT FRANCES (CONT’D)
dialog: Still, hard to be the woman that
text: provokes fear.
text: AUNT FRANCES touches her niece’s neck, and then moves on into
dialog: the crowds.
text: AMELIA looks over as ANTONIA is talking to another young man.
text: She looks down at her feet.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (0.S.)
dialog: You’re the Widow Wren.
text: AMELIA turns to be faced with JAMES.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I dislike that title.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: You’re Miss Wren.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Amelia Wren. And who might you be?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Glaisher. James Glaisher.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 35
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr
dialog: Glaisher.
text: She nods, she makes to walk on. JAMES calls after her
dialog: desperately.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: What brings you here?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: The selfish needs of a sister. You?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: The mercenary needs of a friend -
dialog: he needed accompanying to his
dialog: “romance” —
text: He indicates across the hall, a handsome man dancing straight
text: backed with a woman.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: She is apparently worth thousands
dialog: of pounds a year. I am trapped
dialog: here, just as you.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Well, we needn’t trap each other.
text: She makes to walk on. But JAMES is still not letting her go.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I am a scientist, an astronomer, a
dialog: meteorologist, and —-
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
text: A scientist, an astronomer and a
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: A meteorologist. I believe weather
dialog: can be predicted.
text: AMELIA looks disbelievingly at him.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to make studies of the air
dialog: and I need to be in the air
text: She turns and nods and makes to walk away. JAMES pursues her.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: - and I need you to take me.
text: AMELIA steps back - surprised. There’s a pause.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Do you even have a balloon?
dialog: 26
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 36
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Not yet, no.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: So you make an invitation to me
dialog: when it is I should be inviting
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I need us to - I need you to fly us
dialog: higher than anyone has ever
dialog: travelled before.
text: AMELIA considers. She looks up, she looks at JAMES, she sees
text: her sister circling another man.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Dance with me.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Dance with you?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Dance with me and we may converse
dialog: more.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM. ELEGANT HOUSE. NIGHT 26
text: AMELIA and JAMES are now turning around the dance floor.
text: Around them others move elegantly, AMELIA is determined not
text: to, slipping her feet into the wrong place, kicking her hair
text: back in the wrong manner. Not ostentatiously, if it weren't
dialog: for the fact that we’re studying her we wouldn’t notice, but
dialog: it’s there.
text: Yes, even in dance she finds small ways to rebel.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I presume there is a game you’re
text: playing with others in the room -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: You think I’m trying to make
dialog: another jealous? You’re not that
dialog: handsome.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Every man in this room is petrified
dialog: to be seen talking to you, let
dialog: alone dancing with you. No, your
text: game is with another.
text: Those words hurt AMELIA, but she won’t let them show. She
text: looks across, she sees ANTONIA, who is watching her with a
text: careful smile.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 37
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: You're clever.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Merely observant.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Or presumptuous. And equally, there
dialog: are certain things - if I may -
dialog: that I feel safe in presuming about
dialog: you.
text: JAMES says nothing, but is that fear on his face?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps that you don’t have an
dialog: invitation for tonight’s events.
dialog: Would that be a fair presumption?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: On what basis do you make that
dialog: assumption?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Your suit is two years out of
dialog: fashion, your shoes abominable,
dialog: your dancing ridiculous, I'm
dialog: leading, you are not, and, finally,
dialog: because this man clearly doesn’t
dialog: know you at all.
text: She has steered them to the handsome man he claimed he was
text: here with. She spins him to a stop in front of him.
text: JAMES looks at the man, who frowns back. His secret has been
text: exposed cruelly.
text: But AMELIA doesn’t care.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you for the dance.
text: She disconnects from him. He pulls her back towards him.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I didn’t realise appearances were
dialog: so important to you. I’m sorry they
dialog: do not live up to your society
dialog: standard.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I don’t care what shoes you wear. I
dialog: care that you’re lying to me.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 38
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: It will be your balloon. All I want
dialog: is to help with the design and be
dialog: given the freedom to undertake the
dialog: experiments that -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I am not a coachman for hire.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Good. I’m looking for a fellow
dialog: scientist. To understand the
dialog: weather is to understand how to
dialog: make ships and sailors safer, farms
dialog: more productive. We can prepare
dialog: ourselves and our world for floods,
dialog: drought, famines.
text: He can see he’s getting to her. She opens her mouth to speak,
text: and then pulls back.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to rewrite the rules of the
dialog: air, Miss Wren, and I need your
dialog: help. So will you? Help me?
text: We close on AMELIA’s face. She smiles.
scene_heading: INT. BALLOON FACTORY. DAY 36
text: AMELIA is examining a balloon as it is partially inflated.
text: ANTONIA walks up behind her, dragging her children behind
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: You're punishing me.
text: AMELIA turns and frowns at ANTONIA, and looks particularly
text: surprised to see her children.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I’m not sure a factory full of
dialog: flammable gasses is the safest
dialog: place for children -
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: You're punishing me for dragging
dialog: you to that ridiculous evening.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I'm grateful to you for dragging me
dialog: to that ridiculous evening, I would
dialog: not have made the acquaintance of
dialog: Mr Glaisher otherwise. Now, girls,
dialog: I believe we have some macaroons
dialog: somewhere -
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 39
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: And if that is not proof of
dialog: punishing me then I don’t know what
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Not here.
text: AMELIA walks away from the balloon, past a selection of
text: baskets being woven to her specifics, she doesn’t want this
text: conversation to happen in front of the engineers. She walks
text: quickly, and ANTONIA walks quickly beside her. ANTONIA’s
text: children have to fight to keep up with them both.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: I hated you going in the air with
dialog: Pierre, but why you would go up on
dialog: your own - I can’t even -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: With Mr Glaisher.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: You are my only sister, I do not
dialog: wish to lose you to any more
dialog: foolishness.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: You'd rather I found a man prepared
dialog: to marry me, to devote myself to.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: I'd rather you'd find a way to make
dialog: yourself happy rather than the
dialog: pursuit of frivolous history
dialog: making. You can’t just fly away
dialog: from your problems! You have to
dialog: face them here - on earth - with
dialog: the rest of us.
text: AMELIA pushes their way into a corner where reams of material
dialog: lie ready for stitching.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Antonia, I believe there are
dialog: answers in the sky -
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Let somebody else find them.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Pierre believed it too - and this
dialog: Mr Glaisher -
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: - sounds barely capable of
dialog: anything!
dialog: *
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 40
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: But I am capable - I ama really
dialog: good aeronaut - and I want to use
dialog: what I’m good at -
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: You are a highly accomplished
dialog: woman. You could be good at so many
dialog: things. You could have the most
dialog: beautiful life amongst society - if
dialog: only you’d try.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: And if that isn’t what I want?
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: Then you have to learn to want it.
dialog: Fight the important battles, so you
dialog: may find a life you can be proud
dialog: of.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Up there - it’s where I’ve found
dialog: the greatest happiness.
text: ANTONIA looks at her sister, cold.
speaker_heading: ANTONIA
dialog: He was the happiness, not the damn
dialog: balloon.
dialog: (she calls out)
dialog: Come on girls, we're late for
dialog: lunch.
text: The words sink into AMELIA’s face as she watches her sister
text: pull her children from the room.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. BLUE SKY. DAY. 27
dialog: 18,600ft. Rising 400ft/min. -4C / 25F
text: We rejoin the aeronauts as they soar higher. They are sitting
text: together on the floor of the balloon. JAMES has assembled his
text: instruments on top of the campaign chest, and is using the
text: top of his ruined table to write on.
text: The clouds roll in their glittering masses beneath them and
text: the balloon throws a large shadow on this heap of clouds.
text: JAMES'’s suit is wet through and he is cold - the only thing
dialog: preventing hypothermia is the fierce sun - which is keeping
text: him moderately heated (and causing his clothes to steam).
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Have you been up this high before?
dialog: 28
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 4l
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Only once.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: With Pierre?
text: She says nothing. JAMES looks at her face, she looks
dialog: overwhelmed.
text: There’s a silence. JAMES is unsure how to break the silence.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: We have time enough for it, why
dialog: don’t you tell me about him?
text: AMELIA takes a swab from a pocket in the side of the basket.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Ashamed as I am to not stick to
dialog: your conversational schedule, I
dialog: have nothing to tell.
dialog: Does your forehead not hurt?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I can’t feel it. I didn’t mean to -
dialog: what happened to you -
dialog: I didn’t mean to make light of it.
text: AMELIA nods, and then starts to clean his cut. He lets her.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: It will heal.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You won’t have a scar.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. BLUE SKY. CONTINUOUS - 28
text: 19,400ft. Rising 500ft/min. 0C / 32F
text: As AMELIA tends to JAMES’ wound, a YELLOW BUTTERFLY flutters
text: past them and lands on a piece of JAMES’ equipment. They both
text: look at it in surprise.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: At this height?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: That's exactly what I was thinking.
text: Then another YELLOW BUTTERFLY floats past. Soon they are
text: surrounded by a swarm of butterflies, brilliant yellow
text: against the clear blue sky. It is a sight to behold.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: He was right! The fool was right!
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 42
text: AMELIA stands watching the butterflies - her emotion
text: palpable.
text: JAMES laughs in delight, as a BUTTERFLY lands on his head,
text: and then another on AMELIA’s arm.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Of all the amazing things -
dialog: My friend John Trew - he’s made
dialog: study of them. He theorised -
text: beyond the birds - an air current
dialog: on which only the insects travel...
dialog: I never believed him and I
dialog: certainly didn’t think we’d prove
dialog: him right.
text: The butterfly on his head flies away. He smiles reaches out a
text: hand and gently lifts the butterfly from her arm. This feels
text: like a new intimacy. We lean into that moment and then they
text: both flick it away.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: They are wonderful.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Where are they heading, do you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Perhaps they trust the wind to
dialog: decide.
text: He smiles at her, she smiles back, and then her expression
dialog: changes.
text: She reaches out her hand and places it within the
dialog: butterflies.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: He'd have liked these. Pierre.
text: They dance around her and away. She turns and watch them go.
text: Then she turns back to JAMES, with tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: My husband was the bravest man I
dialog: knew. He saw possibilities others
dialog: could not, but his most enduring
dialog: quality was a deep and true love
dialog: for the beauty of the world.
text: She waits a moment. He looks at her.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 43
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you. Others would have pushed
dialog: me further. Thank you for not.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I cannot quantify what you lost.
text: She looks at him a moment more.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: No. You can’t. Return to your
dialog: instruments, Mr Glaisher. James.
text: JAMES looks at her a moment more, unsure whether to say
text: anything else. She looks back, proud but with a vulnerability
dialog: we haven't seen before.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT’D)
dialog: I said, return to your instruments -
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I shall.
text: He does, and then he looks back at her, and then he returns
text: to his instruments.
scene_heading: INT. AMELIA’S HOUSE. NIGHT 53
text: AMELIA is sitting on her own.
text: A look on her face of pure contemplation.
text: And contemplation for her is pain.
text: She looks over a collection of newspaper clippings; a history
text: of her past life in the air. Headlines saying ‘BELLE OF THE
text: BALLOON!” A wedding picture of her and Pierre. And an article
text: about Pierre’s death in a balloon accident.
scene_heading: EXT. COLONNADE. ROYAL SOCIETY. DAY 37
text: AMELIA’s feet click to the sound of scandal. This is a men-
text: only establishment. Not that any of the men she passes have
text: the confidence to say so. AMELIA knows she’s breaking the
text: rules and is very much enjoying doing so.
speaker_heading: AIRY (0.S.)

speaker_heading: AIRY
dialog: You are very welcome to wait

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN

text: She nods at CHARLES.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Lovely to see you again Charles.
scene_heading: INT. ROYAL SOCIETY. DAY 38
text: JOHN TREW is staring at a watch.
text: JAMES is anxiously packing the crate we will later see on

speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: Come on James, imagine you’re
text: hurtling toward the ground.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Time?
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: Seventeen seconds. Hurry man, your
dialog: equipment is going to be destroyed.
text: He finishes fitting the final pieces.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: Twenty six seconds. Well done.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: And you thought I couldn’t break

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN *
dialog: My senses deserted me -

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Miss Wren, this is an honour -
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 45
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I do not wish to abandon you but -
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: May I give you a tour -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I’m afraid I must.
text: There’s a silence.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Abandon me?
text: JAMES keeps himself under control, but only just.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
text: The build is already under way. The
dialog: largest balloon ever on order...
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I don’t want to climb inside the
dialog: balloon, Mr Glaisher. I don’t want
text: to climb into a balloon ever again.
text: JAMES is heartbroken. And angry.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: No. No. This is unacceptable - a
dialog: vast amount of money has already
dialog: been spent -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I am sorry Sir, I’ve made my
dialog: decision.
text: She walks away.
scene_heading: INT. WATCH SHOP. EAST END OF LONDON. NIGHT 55

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Yes, I’m sorry. I’ve been busy.
speaker_heading: ETHEL GLAISHER
dialog: Yes. We’ve been reading all about
dialog: you in the newspaper.
text: There’s a silence. JAMES can’t meet her eyes.
dialog: 56
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 46
speaker_heading: ETHEL GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Of all the people, James. Women
dialog: don’t belong in balloons, on show -
dialog: and she makes such a show of
dialog: herself. Your reputation risks
dialog: ruin.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Well, you’ll be pleased to hear
dialog: that the expedition is off, Ma.
text: ETHEL says nothing.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: But it was her who did not want to
dialog: risk flight with me. Is he
dialog: upstairs?
speaker_heading: ETHEL GLAISHER
dialog: He had a fall - I don’t know quite
dialog: what caused it - but he is not -
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: It’s got worse?
speaker_heading: ETHEL GLAISHER
text: It comes and goes. Tread carefully
dialog: with him.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS. WATCH SHOP. NIGHT 56

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Hard at it.

speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: Ethel! Ethel!
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Pa. Pa. It’s me. James.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: Ethel? Ethel!
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Ma knows I’m here. Remember, your
dialog: son, I’m your son.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: My son is ten years old.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I got older.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 47
text: ARTHUR looks at him carefully, JAMES stands under the light
text: so he might examine him. His face softens. JAMES walks over
text: to the telescope.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: What have you been looking at?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: Get away from that.
text: JAMES peers through the telescope.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Pallas. You’re looking at Pallas.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: No. Juno.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: You're looking at Juno? You can’t
dialog: be. The correlation is all wrong.
text: ARTHUR smiles. He’s playing a game they both remember.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: You're entirely right, it’s not
dialog: Juno, it’s Vesta.
text: JAMES smiles - he looks through the telescope.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: You're playing games with me old
dialog: man.
text: ARTHUR joins him at the window. He takes out a pair of opera
text: glasses from his day coat, we recognise them as the pair on
dialog: the balloon.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: Of course I’m looking at Pallas.
dialog: Good spotting.
text: JAMES looks up at his Father.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Please don’t pretend you can see
dialog: anything through those.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: You may have moved on to grander
dialog: things James, but I...
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Pa...
text: ARTHUR snorts with laughter. JAMES smiles. He leans down
text: through the telescope. ARTHUR peers up through the opera
text: glasses behind him.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 48
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: These were the glasses I taught you
dialog: to stargaze through, they are quite
dialog: sufficient, for some - work...
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: You've lined her up well. A good
text: sighting.
text: ARTHUR looks closely at JAMES. Fighting his mind.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: Your trip. You’re taking a trip. In
text: a balloon.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: To see the stars.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I’m trying to.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: I used to dream of taking my bed
text: sheet, catching a gust of wind and
text: dancing in a parachute amongst the
dialog: stars.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I know you did. You told me.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR GLAISHER
dialog: There is nothing more mysterious,
dialog: nor more beautiful, than the stars
text: in the sky.
text: They look up at the sky, and see something impossible - a
text: tiny, faraway man floating under a bedsheet, dancing among

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER

speaker_heading: CHARLES GREEN
text: It is an expensive preoccupation.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: And I've heard you're looking to

speaker_heading: CHARLES GREEN
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I would like the opportunity to be
dialog: your second. You know I can’t
dialog: promise funds but I will prove a
dialog: willing accomplice, and I do have

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Still think we won’t make it back?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Just sending a message to Charles

dialog: I needed my equipment more -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I have no spare clothes to give

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: The weight limit was essential. My

dialog: A little sick?

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: You carry four thermometers. You

scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 55
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: No. No, we’re not descending, not

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I thought this was about study.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: It is.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: So why does it seem you’re more
dialog: concerned with height than safety?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: The best way to break a storm is to

dialog: Maybe the best way to break a cold -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: And which science do you base that
dialog: upon?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: The science that says that with
dialog: every layer of air we're travelling
dialog: into an unknown -
scene_heading: AMELIA WREN JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I believe we've already - with every layer of air
dialog: accomplished - we're travelling closer to

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: This balloon has defied everything

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: This is not about the balloon. This

dialog: too and I tell you -
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: No. This isn’t about them. It’s
dialog: about that.
text: He indicates the stars in the sky above them.
text: AMELIA looks to where he’s indicating - the sky above them.
text: The balloon pushes through the thin layer of cirrus that lay
text: above them; the final barrier before the heavens.
text: It ascends into a magnificent icy blue.
text: They look up to the deep Prussian blue of the sky above.
text: There are stars everywhere.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: There is nothing more mysterious,

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You wanted the writing on the

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER

scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 57
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: You understand that decision will

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER

speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: He believes the sky can be

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Of this I am well aware.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: He is, sadly, occasionally wrong,
dialog: he predicted it would snow tonight
dialog: would you believe? But more often
dialog: than not - he finds remarkable
dialog: truths. Travel with him and you
dialog: will discover this. I have.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I’m sorry, I’ve clearly told him
dialog: no, he should not have sent you to
dialog: convince me -
text: JOHN TREW smiles.
speaker_heading: JOHN TREW
dialog: Oh, he didn’t send me, he would

text: He takes a series of readings. But every step he takes, every

text: AMELIA looks up at the balloon, it looks like it’s bursting

text: She moves alongside him to help with his instrumentation.

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Do you know - it’s quite the
dialog: strangest thing - the higher we fly
dialog: - the lower the humidity - there is
dialog: barely any water vapor here at all -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
text: There is still ice.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: And the temperatures -
dialog: unprecedented - freezing ranges
dialog: that nobody has ever predicted.
text: JAMES tries to write down the readings but has difficulty
text: controlling his hands.
text: He looks at his hands - exasperated and then tries again.
text: He looks up at the instruments. He blinks so as to see them.
text: He tries to write something a third time, but it’s a scrawl
text: that’s barely decipherable.
text: He attaches it to a pigeon’s leg. A pigeon that seems barely
text: alive. He throws it out of the balloon - it drops like a
dialog: stone.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: No concern necessary. We have
dialog: another.
text: He opens the final door in the pigeon box. It’s got a Pigeon

text: surprisingly strong and agile.
text: The two twist over in the bottom of the basket.
text: It’s an ugly fight, desperate and full of passion. These two
dialog: are inexperienced (and not particularly accomplished)
text: fighters and the altitude is sapping their strength.
text: But eventually JAMES manages to pin AMELIA down.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: You gave me your word. It is time

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I will not stop - because you can’t

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Can’t you see what’s happening -
dialog: we're going to die unless we

text: JAMES looks at her, and then he feels his nose start to

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Now imagine the story again - and

text: The rigging keeps her protected until she reaches the equator
dialog: of the balloon.
text: She hesitates a moment...and then...
text: She swings out so she can continue climbing up the outside of
text: the balloon. Nothing is protecting her now.
dialog: It’s arduous.
dialog: It’s terrifying.
dialog: It’s undoubtedly perilous.
text: But she’s dogged. She’s merciless with herself. Every piece
text: of pain she ignores. She tries to grab a nearby tether rope,
text: to tie herself to the balloon, but it’s just out of reach.
text: She stretches for it.
text: She loses her grip, and her hands fall backwards - she
text: screams out in fear and pain but stays hooked on the rigging
text: by means of one ankle, which is wedged into a joint of the
dialog: rope binding.

text: Looking down towards the earth.
text: The drop is terrifying.
text: She swings as if in death.
text: She shuts her eyes and then opens them again, trying

text: She looks down at JAMES’s body, he lies still, she considers
dialog: her own.

text: She shuts her eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. TOP OF THE WORLD. DAY 45
dialog: 35,800ft. Rising 1200ft/min. -28C
text: And then she grits her teeth and she pulls herself together.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 66
text: She reaches out for the tether rope and slowly ties the end
text: around her waist. She hooks her wrists around the rope she’s
text: on and pulls herself back to vertical.
text: She begins to climb again.
dialog: And this time every breath hurts.

text: She summits the balloon.
text: She crawls to the valve. She tries to push it open.
dialog: It won’t budge.
text: She thinks, and then - majestically - she gets to her feet.
text: She is standing on top of a balloon that is flying higher
dialog: than anything has ever flown.
text: She is literally on top of the world.
text: A tiny figure on top of a Mammoth which sits against a vast
text: star-filled sky.
text: She looks around herself, admiring it all.
text: And then she brings her foot down hard upon the vent.
text: She smashes down again and again.
text: And the ice cracks.
text: From all sides gas billows out.
text: AMELIA almost disappears within it.
text: We close on her face, she’s oxygen deprived and now breathing
text: in coal gas but she has something left.
dialog: Or does she?
text: She sways, she looks down at the vent, she realises it needs

text: She takes a knife from her belt. She bends down, coughing

text: She pulls her foot clear. Her boot remains lodged in the

text: She stands a moment more.
text: And then collapses. For a while, she lies on top of the *
text: balloon as it gradually slows its ascent, and begins to *
text: descend. And then, gradually at first, her body begins to *
text: slide off the top of the balloon. She wakes up just as it’s *

text: We're close on AMELIA’s face. She’s unconscious and

text: Her eyebrows and eyelashes grow frost on them. It forms
dialog: quickly.
text: We pull back, to see she’s still hanging from the Mammoth on
text: a single rope.
text: We look - in the stillness - at this extraordinary balloon
text: with gas pluming its escape out of the top.
text: We twist and turn with AMELIA for a moment, and it’s almost

scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. DAY 51
text: 35,000ft. Falling 1000ft/min. -26C / -15F

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: James! James!
text: She looks down to JAMES in the basket below - but he doesn’t

text: She swings this way - she swings that - completely severed

dialog: get hold.
text: She looks around herself - she's hanging about 10 feet away

text: Slowly, ever so slowly she starts to swing herself to and

dialog: 52
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019
dialog: She tries once -
text: She tries a second time.
dialog: 69
text: The third time she gets a decent hold - but it slips away.
text: The fourth - she makes her bind.
text: She pulls herself up the rope - and then she grabs hold of

scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. THIN CLOUD. DAY.

dialog: Please. Please. I can’t have this

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)

dialog: Your strange two tube device is

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: It could.

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: We're descending.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN

scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 71
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Busy how?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Your readings Sir.
text: JAMES looks at her. He smiles. He draws up his legs.
text: He groggily gets to his feet.
text: He takes his pencil, and leaning against the internal ropes,
text: he begins to take readings.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: One hour, eleven minutes and six

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Height?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Twenty nine thousand six-hundred

speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Good. Temperature?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Unknown. That equipment has been

dialog: had better days.
text: He picks up the Spectroscope.
text: He looks through it. He puts it down.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: That has no great use either. The
dialog: readings on our descent will be
dialog: less - significant.
text: AMELIA smiles. He smiles back. He looks at her. He looks at
text: her hands.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Your hands.
text: AMELIA looks down at her hands, they’re black and purple.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I lost my gloves at some - I lost
dialog: my gloves.
text: JAMES opens one of his boxes. He pulls out a bottle of
dialog: brandy.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 72
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: You did not have room for oils -
dialog: but you did for brandy.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Yes. Well. A scientist is nothing

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold them out.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: This is going to hurt.
text: AMELIA looks at him. She holds out her hands. JAMES pours
text: brandy over the top of them. This stings. She grits her teeth
dialog: to the pain.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Better?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Worse.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I don’t know what you did for me up
dialog: there but I have no doubt it was a
dialog: great act.
text: He takes her hands in his.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Your poor hands.
text: He rubs them gently.
dialog: It’s beautiful.
text: She looks up at him.
text: He looks back. It begins to snow.
text: He looks around at the snow falling all around them.
text: He grins at her.
text: She smiles back.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: And now snow, as if we haven't had
dialog: enough.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 73
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: It will pass.
text: She smiles again.
text: He takes out a sample glass. He catches the snowdrops. She
text: looks at him.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Possibly interesting to analyse the
dialog: melt water.
text: She nods. And then she picks up a glass and tries to catch
text: them too. He laughs. She does too.
text: The two of them continue in their complicity. And it is
dialog: beautiful.
text: And then AMELIA looks back at JAMES, a strange smile on her
text: face. JAMES watches as snow flakes land on her shoulders, her
text: cheeks, her eyelashes.
scene_heading: INT. BALLOON. SNOW. EVENING 59
text: 19,500ft. Falling 2500ft/min. -5C / 23F

text: There’s an almost perfect silence between them as they watch
text: the snow fall around them as the balloon descends.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: They say that ballooning is about
dialog: going up, but I’ve always enjoyed
dialog: the descent just as much. The
dialog: feeling of the world coming back to

text: She looks at JAMES.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: And we've returned with important
dialog: science, am I right?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: We have.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: My sister wanted to know why I
dialog: would fly in a balloon again. I
dialog: think it was because I wanted - all
dialog: that I knew - all that he taught me
dialog: - all that I lost - to be for
dialog: something.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 74
text: JAMES thinks, desperate to give her the meaning.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: It seems the air gets colder the
text: closer we rise to the sun. The
dialog: humidity gets less dense despite us
text: floating through clouds, which is
text: also odd. There is a clear lack of
dialog: oxygen at the upper reaches -—
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: That’s not what I mean.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Newton said - “we build too many
dialog: walls and -”
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: I don’t want to hear from Newton, I
dialog: want to hear from you.
text: JAMES thinks deeply.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: All my life, I’ve found comfort in
dialog: science. It helps give meaning to
dialog: the many things we cannot
dialog: control... Brings a degree of order
dialog: to the chaos that surrounds us. But
dialog: whilst we may be able to explain
dialog: the science behind an aureole, or
dialog: the falling snow, it is not
dialog: possible to account for its beauty.
dialog: No amount of data could have helped
dialog: me predict that the only person who
dialog: could have taken us to the heights
dialog: we reached today - was you.
dialog: Together, we have brought the stars
dialog: closer.
text: This line penetrates deep. AMELIA softly smiles.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: We have brought the stars closer.

dialog: so.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. SNOW. CONTINUOUS - 60
text: 16,000ft. Falling 3500ft/min. -1C / 30F

scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 75
text: She checks a gauge. She looks up at the balloon.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Do you notice something about the
dialog: snow?
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
text: It’s hovering. It’s static.
text: JAMES looks at it, she sees she’s right.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: That is strange - what might -
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: We might, if we were travelling at
dialog: the same speed as it.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: The same speed as - snow?
text: AMELIA looks up at the balloon. She frowns. She looks down at
text: her uncovered shoe.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: The gas, it’s still escaping, this -
dialog: combined with the decrease in
dialog: pressure means -—
text: She grabs the valve line and pulls hard.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
text: - the balloon is collapsing.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: Help me. Pull.
text: The balloon comes out of the cloud. He grabs the valve line
text: with her and together they tug hard.
text: Her boot is dislodged and falls down hard through the
text: interior of the balloon, it lands with a thud in the basket.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: What on earth was that?
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: My shoe. Probably best not to
dialog: question it.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: But that was - if your shoe was up
dialog: there that means...
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 76
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: We need to lose weight. A lot of
dialog: weight.
text: She takes out a knife and starts to try and cut at the
text: ballast. But her hands won’t allow her. JAMES takes the knife
text: from her. He cuts it quickly and throws it.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: The chest!
text: They throw the chest out together. She tries to take her oils
dialog: off but her hands won’t work
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: Jackets!
text: JAMES throws off his heavy jacket and then starts throwing
text: out his instruments. He stops - he looks at his pocket watch
text: and then his glasses. He throws out the watch and then looks
text: at the glasses. He keeps them in his hand.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: (full of decisiveness)
dialog: Climb up into the hoop. Do it now.
dialog: Quickly.

text: AMELIA looks at him and then the fast approaching ground.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER (CONT'D)
dialog: It is the heaviest weight. It’s our
dialog: only option.
text: JAMES climbs into the hoop, but he can’t do it with the
text: glasses in his hand, he throws them over, shutting his eyes
text: for a moment, and then clambers up. He holds down a hand to
text: help AMELIA inside, she frowns at him and climbs inside.
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. HOOP. CONTINUOUS - 61
text: 7,500ft. Falling 4,500ft/min. 5C / 41F
text: JAMES lays down on the hoop, wrapping his legs round it to

scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 77

text: The basket now hangs precariously, held by a single rope.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN (CONT'D)
dialog: James!
text: He slashes at the rope but doesn’t manage to sever it.
text: The basket swings mightily underneath them, causing the

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Ready?

scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. HOOP. CONTINUOUS - 61A
text: 2,500ft. Falling 2000ft/min. 15C / 59F

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: It will be enough.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN

text: And then he realises why she’s telling him.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: Amelia, what are you doing? No.
text: She pulls herself up onto the hoop and prepares to jump.

speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
text: We sever the cord that holds the
dialog: balloon in shape, the silk will be
text: sucked up to the top of the
text: netting, and act as a parachute.
speaker_heading: AMELIA WREN
dialog: It won't work.
speaker_heading: JAMES GLAISHER
dialog: I will not return alone. It will be
dialog: both of us, or neither of us.
text: AMELIA looks at him with a startled smile and then begins to
text: wrap her arms and legs in amongst the ropes.
text: The descent is getting really fast now. The envelope of the
text: balloon is almost entirely collapsed. The noise is
text: overwhelming, everything is overwhelming.
text: He smiles at her, thinks, shuts his eyes and then cuts the
dialog: cord.
dialog: And the balloon is free -
scene_heading: EXT. BALLOON. CONTINUOUS - 61B
text: 800ft. Falling 1000ft/min. 20C / 68F
text: The material flaps open - and spreads - and they are yanked
text: upwards - both shouting out in pain as they are violently
text: wrenched by the ropes.
dialog: They look at each other, has it worked?
text: It looks like it has. The parachute is holding and they are
text: floating downwards. JAMES looks up astonished.
text: The ground comes at them rapidly: the wind is carrying them
text: at quite some speed and it whips the balloon through the
dialog: fields.
text: JAMES looks at AMELIA - a final moment of connection - he
text: smiles and then they smash hard into a copse of trees.
scene_heading: EXT. COPSE OF TREES. EVENING 62
text: We travel fast and brutally through it.
text: The ring snaps and JAMES is thrown off.
scene_heading: The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 79
text: But we stay with AMELIA who clings on for dear life to her
text: partial parachute as the balloon is torn through hedges.
text: And then she’s free of the trees.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD. EVENING 63
text: The balloon now acts like a sail and drags Wren across the
text: ground spitting up stones and debris as it goes.
text: It hits the ground and bounces up again.
text: It flies for a moment more. We can almost feel the rush of
dialog: the wind.
text: Then it hits the ground savagely again. She loses
dialog: consciousness.
text: Her seemingly lifeless body is dragged further across the

text: the balloon comes to a standstill.
text: And there’s silence.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD. EVENING 64
text: AMELIA opens her eyes.
