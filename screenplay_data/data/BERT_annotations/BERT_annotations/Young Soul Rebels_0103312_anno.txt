scene_heading: 1 EXT. CITY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: City silhouette. Sunset.
dialog: 
dialog: Main title: Young Soul Rebels
dialog: Soul sounds and punk from 1977: Parliament: 'P. Funk Wants
dialog: To Get Funked Up' and X-Ray Spex: 'Identity'.
dialog: 
text: A DJ Voice-over. He welcomes the listeners to
dialog: 'Station we funk... the Mother Ship
dialog: connection... dealers of funky music and
dialog: P.funk...'
text: Credits over more of the DJ's upbeat patter:
dialog: 'Soul Patrol on 107 FM... uncut funk
dialog: across London town...'
dialog: 
text: The DJ tells his listeners to
dialog: Come to the Crypt place/
dialog: and get some funk in your face...
text: before announcing a tune, The Blackbyrds: 'Rock Creek Park'.
dialog: 
dialog: Subtitle: London, June 1977 - the Queen's Silver Jubilee.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2 EXT. PARK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A blue-black summer sky. City road sounds in the distance.
text: The quiet is broken by a radio.
dialog: 
text: A YOUNG BLACK MAN climbs over the Park fence, moves into
text: the bushes. He changes station on his radio cassette
text: recorder, tunes into Soul Patrol.
dialog: 
text: The YOUNG BLACK MAN presses the 'Record' button. The
text: station DJ announces Roy Ayers: 'Running Away', a song with
text: an upbeat tempo yet a downbeat lyric:
dialog: 
dialog: We don't love each other/
dialog: like we used to do...
text: Running away... Running away...
dialog: You don't do the things you used to do/
dialog: Running away...
dialog: 
text: The YOUNG BLACK MAN is not alone in the Park. MEN weave
text: slowly through the bushes. Leaves rustle, twigs crack.
text: Shadows and silhouettes. The YOUNG BLACK MAN rests against
text: a tree. Matches are struck. The flames come and go like
text: fireflies. The YOUNG BLACK MAN watches the movements.
text: Suddenly a white hand strokes the YOUNG BLACK MAN's arm.
text: The WHITE MAN's voice is unnaturally quiet, edgy. It could
text: be seductive, it could be violent. It has a disguised
text: quality. The WHITE MAN reaches for the cassette player. He
text: tries to turn down the volume.
scene_heading: YOUNG BLACK MAN
dialog: That's a firm hand. What ya want? Don't
dialog: mess with the sounds, man.
speaker_heading: WHITE MAN
dialog: Turn it down mate, draws attention. Don't
dialog: want an audience.
text: The YOUNG BLACK MAN holds the cassette player away from the
speaker_heading: WHITE MAN.
speaker_heading: WHITE MAN
dialog: Like it down 'ere, do yer? Come down 'ere
dialog: regular?
dialog: 
text: The WHITE MAN snatches again at the cassette player, turns
text: the radio down. The music stops but the 'Record' button is
text: still depressed. The WHITE MAN pulls the YOUNG BLACK MAN
text: towards him in a rough movement.
dialog: 
scene_heading: YOUNG BLACK MAN
dialog: Yeah, but I ain't seen you before. So
dialog: leggo ma han'... I ain't into no rough
dialog: stuff, right?
dialog: 
text: The YOUNG BLACK MAN rests the cassette player on the ground.
text: He kneels, starts to rub at the WHITE MAN's crotch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHITE MAN
dialog: Cute, aren't yer?
scene_heading: YOUNG BLACK MAN
dialog: So ya wanna get to know me?
speaker_heading: WHITE MAN
dialog: Wot's yer name?
scene_heading: YOUNG BLACK MAN
dialog: Name? You a policeman or what?
speaker_heading: WHITE MAN
dialog: Just being friendly, tell us yer name.
scene_heading: YOUNG BLACK MAN
dialog: Man, you're one stubborn white bwoy. OK -
dialog: Terry. Friends call me T.J.
dialog: 
text: They kiss, but the WHITE MAN turns violent. He grips T.J.
text: by the neck. There's a brief and angry struggle.
dialog: 
text: The WHITE MAN's hand grabs at the cassette recorder. The
text: WHITE MAN runs through the Park.
dialog: 
text: On the ground - TWO MEN making love, the WHITE MAN stumbles
text: over them... He drops the cassette recorder.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The pirate radio station, hidden round the back of a broken
text: down car. At the back of the garage.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS, a nineteen year old light-skinned youth and CAZ,
text: darker skinned and a bit older, are at the turntable.
text: CHRIS's face is reflected in a rotating record.
dialog: 
text: The minimal lighting reveals little of the room, but the
text: two DJs are clearly dressed soul-style.
dialog: 
text: The last bars of 'Running Away' play. CHRIS is at the
text: ready. He speaks into a microphone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: And finally from the Players Association:
dialog: 'I Like It' - out now on the Vanguard
dialog: label. This is Chris...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: And this is Caz, coming to you live on...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS and CAZ
dialog: Soul Patrol.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: East London's most exclusive P. Funk
dialog: station... reminding you to boogie down
dialog: Club 7 tomorrow...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS and CAZ
dialog: Eight till late.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: See you there.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Bye...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS and CAZ
dialog: And may the funk be with you!
dialog: 
text: CHRIS spins in his chair towards CAZ. They clap hands in
dialog: air, pleased the session went well.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4 EXT. CAR - NIGHT
text: CAZ drives to the Park. CHRIS is laid back in passenger
dialog: seat.
text: CAZ pulls up sharply.
text: The car headlamps light up a poster on the Park railings.
dialog: 
text: A punk-graphic style ad for a 'Fuck the Jubilee' concert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: You going to the concert?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Oh leave it out. The only music they're
dialog: into is the 'livin-in-a-Babylon-me-no-
dialog: have-no-nice-time' music.
dialog: 
text: CAZ smiles at the exaggerated Jamaican accent.
text: CHRIS relaxes, takes out a spliff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: FUNK the Jubilee, now dat would be our
dialog: event!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That's right. This is for punks an'
dialog: hippies. So why are we stoppin?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: I thought I might get a bit of air...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Likely story... I'll see myself home
dialog: then... You are ba... ad!
text: CHRIS draws on the spliff. Then hands it to CAZ.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 5 EXT. PARK - NIGHT
speaker_heading: MURDERER'S Point of View (POV)
text: CHRIS climbs out of the car, CAZ follows.
text: CHRIS heads off towards the estate.
dialog: 
text: CAZ walks into the Park. Like T.J. before him, he climbs over
dialog: the fence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 6 INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY
text: A small and intimate barbershop, like someone's front room.
text: Images of famous black men on the wall - Muhammad Ali,
text: Martin Luther King - a hall of fame mixed in with the usual
text: barbershop postcards and framed certificates.
text: A MIDDLE-AGED BLACK MAN and TWO BOYS wait their turn.
text: The BARBER cuts CHRIS's hair.
dialog: 
text: CAZ is in the background. He flicks through a soul magazine.
dialog: The cover: Britain's Soul Scene: The Good, The Bad and the
dialog: Plastic!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hey, me can show you how to do a duck's arse.
speaker_heading: BARBER
dialog: Look man. I do the best duck's arse in Dalston!
dialog: 
text: The BOYS fall about laughing at the mention of 'duck's
dialog: arse'.
dialog: 
text: CAZ calls across to the BARBER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Mr Lloyd, can I turn up the juice?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBER
dialog: Ah, go on, man.
dialog: 
text: As CAZ turns up the stereo, the BARBER holds a mirror to
text: show CHRIS the cut at the back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBER
dialog: Have a look...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, man, you're not bad at all...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBER
dialog: Blessed cheek!
dialog: 
text: An OLDER BLACK MAN walks into the barbershop. He speaks
text: quietly and soberly so that the BOYS don't hear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
dialog: See dem kill a black bwoy in the Park las'
dialog: night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIDDLE-AGED MAN
dialog: What d'you say?
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN
text: They kill a bwoy in the Park las' night.
dialog: Man called James, Terry James.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS turns in the chair, shocked at the news.
text: CAZ walks out of the barbershop as another MAN enters.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 7 EXT.STREET - DAY
dialog: 
text: CAZ walks to his car, he leans on the roof.
dialog: 
text: He climbs into the driving seat.
dialog: 
text: He rests his head on the steering wheel.
dialog: 
text: Rain pours down the windscreen.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS joins him in the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: I know it ain't right, but I keep
dialog: thinking it could've been me, ya know?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: How dyer know it was roun' that bit of
dialog: the park?
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Why else would T.J. be in the park for

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I didn't mean it like that. Caz. Christ,
dialog: I knew 'im as well yer know.
speaker_heading: CAZ

dialog: questions. You didn't see 'im?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Not last night. There was 'ardly anyone
dialog: there. I thought it was quiet...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 8 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR-PARK - DAY
dialog: 
text: CAZ drives into the car-park.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS climbs out the passenger door.
dialog: 
text: He walks round to the driver's side. The window is wound
text: down. CAZ stays in the car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: So yer definitely not gonna come wiv us?
dialog: It doesn't 'ave to be today...
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: I ain't stoppin' ya.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Caz, we've got to get some steady money
dialog: in, mate. An' I've got to get my Mum off
dialog: my back. D'yer know what I mean?
dialog: 
text: CAZ nods.

dialog: up wiv Metro.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Look Caz, I can't stop livin' my life coz
dialog: he's dead, can I?
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Rest it, Chris. I'll see ya later.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Where yer going?
dialog: 
text: CAZ makes some effort to pull himself round.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: I'm gonna go down and see Roland 'bout
dialog: some crisp new tunes. You wait... I'll
dialog: make tonight so damn funky even the white
dialog: boys'll shake a leg!
speaker_heading: CHRIS

dialog: dreamer.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Ow d'ya mean?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Comin' to Metro for employment!
dialog: 
text: Both smile. CHRIS rests his hand briefly on CAZ's shoulder.
text: He heads off. CAZ drives towards the Exit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 9 INT. METRO RADIO - DAY
dialog: 
text: An imposing foyer, tall walls, elegant.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS steels himself to go through.
dialog: 
text: Working against the elegance of the foyer there is an
text: extraordinary display of Jubilee tat. A vast crown with
text: lights and a fountain dominates the foyer.
dialog: 
text: And on the staircase that leads off the foyer there's a
text: cardboard cut-out of the Queen, complete with mechanical
text: waving arm.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS's colour and soul style stand out at Metro. There's a
text: compensatory cockiness to his step. He passes the SECURITY
text: GUARDS to speak to JILL, the young white receptionist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hi!
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Hello, can I help you?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: 'ope so. I'm 'ere to see Jeff. Jeff Kane,
dialog: Soul Show.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Is he expecting you?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, he said to pass by. Me and 'im are
dialog: good mates.
dialog: 
text: JILL knows he's blagging. That view is confirmed when JEFF
text: KANE passes through the foyer, acknowledging only herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF KANE
dialog: Hello, Jill.
dialog: 
text: JEFF makes to leave. CHRIS looks at JILL... she nods...
text: CHRIS pursues JEFF.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Jeff Kane? Hi, Jeff. My name's Chris,
dialog: Chris Morgan. I'm a big fan of your show,
dialog: man... I wanted to talk to you about the
dialog: station's plans...'cos me and my partner
dialog: Caz, we'd like...
dialog: 
text: JEFF pats CHRIS's shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF KANE
dialog: Thanks. Glad you like the show. It's good
dialog: to meet listeners.
dialog: 
text: JEFF KANE wanders away. CHRIS catches at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I ain't just a listener... We're DJs... We
dialog: run a club, we'd like to get more into
dialog: radio, yer know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF KANE
dialog: Club DJs, radio DJs... not the same
dialog: thing. Do you know how many listeners
dialog: think they'd make DJs? Come on...
dialog: 
text: JEFF gestures for CHRIS to follow him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: But we're good. Anyway, you still play
dialog: clubs, don't ya?
speaker_heading: JEFF KANE
dialog: Less now. A few weeks ago I was booked at
text: some goddam club in Essex. They start
dialog: giving me this ten-per-cent black-entry
dialog: crap, otherwise, they say, their regulars
dialog: are gonna cause some trouble. I told them
dialog: to sit on it.
dialog: 
text: JEFF gestures, CHRIS laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: But bout us being on the radio...
speaker_heading: JEFF KANE
dialog: Send in a tape. Make it quality. Try Tony
text: Cortin first, then keep hammering on his
dialog: door. But I'll tell you something... an
dialog: hour of soul a week is an hour too much
dialog: for some. We got these patriotic
text: listeners out there, and they always ring.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I thought your show was doing well?
speaker_heading: JEFF KANE
dialog: It's doing great. That's what they can't
dialog: handle. But let me ask you something...
dialog: 
text: As JEFF speaks, a young black woman (TRACY) comes down the
text: stairs towards them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF KANE
dialog: ... Do you play music for yourself - to
dialog: party - or for the listeners?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I didn't say at first, but me and my mate
dialog: Caz, we don't just do a club... we run a
dialog: station ourselves.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS takes TRACY in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF KANE
dialog: Okay, okay. You're serious.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Tony's screaming for you upstairs.
speaker_heading: JEFF KANE
dialog: I gotta run. Send in that tape and keep
dialog: complaining!
dialog: 
text: JEFF holds up a clenched fist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEFF KANE
dialog: Be down in twenty minutes if you want to
dialog: talk some more.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Thanks... Yeah...
dialog: 
text: CHRIS and TRACY smile at each other. JEFF hurries up the
text: stairs. CHRIS watches as TRACY follows.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 10 EXT. PARK - DAY
dialog: 
text: A FORENSICS MAN investigates the scene of the murder. He
text: hands a bag of potential evidence to a POLICEMAN. Police
text: radio sounds in the background.
text: The area around the scene of the murder has been cordoned
text: off with tape.
text: CAZ walks into the Park, carrying a Contempo Records
text: carrier bag.
text: The POLICE continue their work, they dismantle a cloth
dialog: screen.
text: Two MIDDLE-AGED BLACK WOMEN walk towards the scene of the
dialog: murder.
text: A POLICEMAN lifts the tape to allow the WOMEN to duck under.
text: They lay wreaths by the tree where T.J. was killed.
text: The WOMEN cry.
dialog: 
text: A POLICEMAN eyes CAZ suspiciously. CAZ catches the glance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 11 INT. METRO RADIO - LATER IN THE DAY
dialog: 
text: TRACY walks down the stairs towards CHRIS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I've seen you before... Maunkberry's.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No, Global Village. Lacy's? Gullivers
dialog: maybe? Or is it Saturday lunchtime down
dialog: the 100? I've seen you somewhere, I know
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: TRACY nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: So what are you doing down here, apart
dialog: from harassing poor Jeff and making
dialog: Security nervous? Most DJs run a mile
text: when a fan turns up... Jeff's fighting to
dialog: keep the Soul Show running and along
dialog: comes you saying you want your own soul
dialog: show. I think he was pretty polite
dialog: considering...
dialog: 
text: CHRIS ducks back, as if fending off the blows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Okay, cool... I'll split, yeah? Listen,
dialog: 'ow did you get to work for him anyhow?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I don't. I wouldn't mind. I'm on the 'In
text: Town Tonight' show - PA to the producer.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: The 'In Town Tonight' show?
dialog: 
text: CHRIS unfolds a piece of paper from his pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'll tell you what's in town -- where
dialog: those in the know go - those who tune
dialog: into Radio Soul Patrol!
text: TRACY chuckles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Soul Patrol?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: 107 FM. It's badly funky! I'll leave your
text: name at the door.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh...
dialog: 
text: CHRIS has performed the patter and chat-up line, now he
text: makes to go. TRACY calls him back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You'll leave a name at the door?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, sure!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Well, what is it?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Shame!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Tracy! Plus one... !
dialog: 
text: CHRIS smiles. He and TRACY part, CHRIS breezes past the
scene_heading: SECURITY GUARDS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12 EXT. PARK - DAY
dialog: 
text: CHRIS walks across the Park. He keeps to the paths. There
text: is an unease about him. The Park, the scene of the murder,
text: now the site of everyday park pleasures. A JOGGER pounds
text: past CHRIS, startling him.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS passes a POLICEMAN.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS finds his nine year old sister, TRISH. She's with two
text: of her FRIENDS. They're some way from where the murder took
text: place. A quick hug for CHRIS from TRISH. She and her
text: friends seem pleased to be talking to a 'big boy'. TRISH
text: jumps to touch the new haircut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Watcha, baldie!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Alright, Trish? What yer doin' round 'ere?
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Police wouldn't let us play over there.
dialog: Bloke got killed.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah. I know.
dialog: 
text: TRISH turns to her FRIENDS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: My bruwa's a soul boy, and I'm a soul
dialog: girl.
dialog: 
text: TRISH breaks into her soul girl routine. She has obviously
text: practised. She half-hums, half-sings as she dances. They
text: sing and dance to El Coco: 'Let's Get It Together'.
dialog: 
text: TRISH stops the dance and takes CHRIS to one side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Will yer show us the formation dance? I
dialog: wanna show my mates, but it's too 'ard. I
dialog: can't rememba it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: One dance yeah? An' that's it. Mum'll
dialog: kill me, lettin' you 'ang about 'ere.
dialog: Ready? One...two...three... four...
dialog: 
text: The three girls fall into line as CHRIS turns, kicks and
text: steps. Neat, precise movements. The girls are good.
text: The actual song over the girls' legs as they do a formation
text: soul dance step. Finally TRISH breaks off, runs to the
text: nearby bushes.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Got something to show yer.
dialog: 
text: She picks up a battered radio cassette recorder, T.J.'s.
text: Left in the murderer's panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: One... two. ..three...four...
dialog: 
text: TRISH holds the cassette player for CHRIS to see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Shame this is broke.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS looks it over. Unimpressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Where d' ya get that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Found it... Can yer sell it for us?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Dunno... it looks well broke.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Alright, I'll check it. Come on girls...
dialog: 
text: They move to leave the Park.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 13 EXT. BACKSTREET - DAY
dialog: 
text: CHRIS, carrying the cassette player, is followed by TRISH
text: and the girls. They're still dancing to 'Let's Get It
dialog: Together'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Listen Trish, I'll see ya back at the yard.
dialog: Yer dinner'll be ready...
dialog: 
text: The GIRLS dance away. CHRIS walks on alone. He passes a
text: National Front slogan, painted on a railway arch wall.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS bangs his fist hard against the wall.
text: The MURDERER (seen only from the back) watches as CHRIS
text: ducks under the bridge... walks on...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 14 INT. GARAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The garage, site of the night-time pirate radio, now seen
text: more fully in the daytime. A large room, a certain grandeur
text: to it. It's almost a shrine to reggae/roots/rasta. Red,
text: green, gold... in clothes, on album covers and posters.
text: There's a boxing punch-bag suspended from the ceiling and a
text: rough and ready shower area.
dialog: 
text: A battery of homemade speakers, loose wires, valves and a
text: throbbing sound - reggae.
dialog: 
text: CARLTON, Caz's brother, works on an engine in the middle of
text: the room, his overalls dirty with grease.
text: As CHRIS enters, DAVIS, a young black man, wraps a small
text: parcel. He pulls out a betting slip to do the job. His
text: customer is a young, white punk, later identified as
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Yeah, nice gaff you got 'ere... You got
dialog: any wiz?
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: No suh! We don deal in chemicals.
text: BILLIBUDD watches as CHRIS crosses from CARLTON to DAVIS,
text: touching hands in greeting. CHRIS waits for BILLIBUDD to
dialog: leave before speaking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You 'eard about the murder in the Park?
text: DAVIS kisses his teeth. He clearly doesn't want to talk
text: about it. CHRIS glances at BILLIBUDD.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Look, it's Johnny Rotten...
dialog: 
text: BILLIBUDD leaves the garage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Gimme a three pound draw.
dialog: 
text: DAVIS pulls out a plastic bag full of weed from his jacket,
text: and another betting slip. He sprinkles a cluster of weed
text: onto the slip before folding it up and handing it to CHRIS.
text: CHRIS takes it in one hand, puts it to his nose and smells
text: it. With the other hand he pays over three pound notes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLTON
dialog: Go easy on the draw ya know Chris, min'
dialog: it don' lick aff ye 'ead!
dialog: 
text: DAVIS takes out the packet of drugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: Hold on a minute, don' be in no haste.
dialog: 
text: DAVIS hands the weed to CHRIS and takes the money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Any sign of Caz?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLTON
dialog: Only see dat brudda o' mine when 'e wants
dialog: something...
text: CHRIS tests the cassette recorder from the park. It seems
text: to be broken. He flips out the tape and crosses to the
text: garage tapedeck.
dialog: 
text: He takes out the reggae tape, plays the tape from the park.
text: He's excited to find the tape is of his and Caz's Soul
dialog: Patrol station.
dialog: 
text: On the tape: Roy Ayers: 'Running Away'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You hear that man! Soul Patrol!
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: Tek aff dat pretty bwoy music, man. Unna
dialog: Soul bwoy! Ye wanna fling aff dem earring
dialog: an' tune into the roots man, ye no see?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Bwoy, rest yerself. You're only into the
dialog: roots 'cos you can't dance!
dialog: 
text: Everyone laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: How you mean?!
dialog: 
text: The laughter increases as DAVIS turns up the cassette and
text: dances to the music. It's a fast and furious dance, a
text: satire on the Soul Boy style. DAVIS gets wilder in the
text: parody, he's ready to end with a spot spin...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: Shuck!
dialog: 
text: The spin stops halfway...
dialog: 
text: TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMEN and a CID MAN walk in on them.
dialog: 
text: The CID MAN switches the cassette player off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARLTON
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Oi, oi... leave the tunes ..
speaker_heading: CARLTON
dialog: Who ask you for come in here?

dialog: 
text: CAZ is stretched out on Chris's bed. He looks intense,
text: absorbed. He swigs whisky from a bottle.
text: Jean Carn: 'Don't Let It Go To Your Head' on the stereo.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS comes in.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Last place I thought I'd find you!
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Ya Mum let me in.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Filth were round the garage. Makin'
dialog: enquiries an' generally kickin' the place
dialog: in. An' your bruwa wants us out. Come to
dialog: think about it, it's not safe now anyway.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS picks up the Contempo record bag. Tips it up, looks

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Great, yer got them new tunes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Yeah... So what time you on Metro then?
dialog: Wiv you gone so long, took it they'd
dialog: given you a programme on the spot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Look, it was a waste of time, jus' like

dialog: Great, you got the new Slave...
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Mnnn... mnnn...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Look, I made myself look a right wally.
dialog: Does that satisfy yer?

speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: You actually met Jeff Kane?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, the man 'imself. Hey, is that the
dialog: new Benson?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Yeah, yeah. What'd he say?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: He said an hour a week of soul is an hour
dialog: too much for some - for a starter. Lots
dialog: of people go and see him, not so many
dialog: pirates though, Tracy was sayin'... Donna
dialog: Summer?!
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: The very latest. I 'ad to fight 'alf the
dialog: gay disco DJs to get that one. So who is
dialog: Tracy?
dialog: 
text: CHRIS selects a record to play. He looks at one of the new
text: ones, it's in a blank, white sleeve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Ow come there's nothin' on this label?
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: That's a rejects, ain't it? All the big
dialog: labels are binning the records now -
dialog: well, they can't get the black bands on
dialog: tele, so they can't be bothered to
dialog: promote 'em.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: As if they try though.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS half-dances to the new record. He still has some of
text: the others in his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: ... So what else 'ave we? Right, you got
dialog: the new Parliament, what about the Philly
dialog: stuff?
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: I can't keep shelling out, can I Chris?
dialog: We're gonna have to get some

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: ANN

speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Oh yeah, an' it ain't a joke playing at

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: I'm absolutely sick of it... Anyway, get

speaker_heading: CAZ

speaker_heading: ANN

speaker_heading: CAZ

scene_heading: 18 EXT. REDBRICK ESTATE - EARLY EVENING
dialog: 
text: SPARKY, a white boy, heavily tattooed, wearing full skinhead

dialog: 
text: To get to the car, CAZ and TRISH have to pass him.

speaker_heading: SPARKY
dialog: Oi, soulhead, where's yer boyfr... oops,

speaker_heading: SPARKY
dialog: My feelings is really hurt now Caz...

scene_heading: 19 INT. CHRIS's FLAT - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Eddie Henderson:'Say You Will' on the stereo.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS is stretched out, trying to push himself into a pair
text: of tight, black leather trousers. He tugs the zip. They're
text: at least two sizes too small.
text: Later: CHRIS has changed his mind... he zips up red leather
text: trousers. He's happier with the effect.
dialog: 
text: He pulls on tight cowboy boots, but decides against...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 20 EXT. ESTATE COURTYARD - EVENING
dialog: 
text: CAZ, in a fresh outfit, returns from dropping TRISH off.
text: SPARKY has been joined by two mates, BIGGS and KELLY. KELLY
text: is a mixed-race skinhead.
text: As CAZ's car pulls into the courtyard the gang hover round,
text: half-blocking CAZ's way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Wot you up to these days, Caz? We 'eard
dialog: something bout some poncy little radio
dialog: for all yer little soulboys.
dialog: 
text: As BIGGSY speaks, KEN, a handsome if slightly going-to-seed
text: man, aged about thirty, appears in the shed area, in the
dialog: background.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Secret list'ner Biggsy? You used to be
dialog: into it, didn't ya?
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Oi, you wanna watch yerself, soulie.
dialog: Uwerwise yer might find yerself arrested
dialog: for one fing or the other..
dialog: 
text: CAZ notices KEN and moves to speak to him. Away from the
dialog: gang.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: You got a minute Ken? Wanted a word...
dialog: That mixer ya got us.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Yeah, what about it?
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: It's duff...
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Oh, yer jokin? Look, tell yer what. I'll
dialog: come and 'ave a look at it. If I can't
dialog: fix it I'll find yer something else.
dialog: Something better this time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Cheap! I ain't linin' yer pockets again,
dialog: Ken. Specially if ya spending it on
dialog: shirts like that!... Sad.
dialog: 
text: CAZ touches KEN's shirt with a gesture of distaste.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Nah... forget the mixer. I'm afta a betta

speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: I'll see what I can do for yer...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 21 INT. CHRIS's FLAT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: On the stereo the end of Eddie Henderson: 'Say You Will'.
text: CHRIS dances to the music, he's still getting ready.
dialog: 
text: CAZ appears at the doorway. Unnoticed he watches CHRIS
dialog: dance.
dialog: 
text: CAZ enjoys the sight of CHRIS changing, the successive
text: revealing and concealing of flesh as CHRIS tries to settle
text: on a shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: You're getting thinner...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, it's all the 'ard work.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: I've noticed...
dialog: 
text: CAZ nods approval at the final selection of shirt. CHRIS
text: checks out his overall look in the mirror. He's satisfied.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 22 EXT. ESTATE BALCONY (overlooking courtyard) - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CAZ and CHRIS haul records out onto the balcony. They stop
text: to briefly hug. Part of the building up for the night.
dialog: They're off...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 23 EXT. ESTATE COURTYARD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: But as CAZ and CHRIS head for the car, the gang is again in
text: evidence. BIGGSY is perched on Caz's car bonnet.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS hits BIGGSY with a record case.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hey, off the metallic...
dialog: 
text: BIGGSY slides off the bonnet, KELLY plays suggestively with
text: the car aerial.
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Wanna play wiv yer aerial!
dialog: 
text: CHRIS hits KELLY with the record case.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Oi, watch the cloth, moth!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Piss off!
dialog: 
text: SPARKY intervenes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPARKY
dialog: Bit wound up, aren't we? Wot you need is
dialog: a party, Chris. Comin' to our little
dialog: Jubilee get togewer? You could wear your
dialog: white suit, an' I'll wear mine...
dialog: 
text: CHRIS speaks in mock East End white...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Thought that was your style Sparky, my
dialog: son. A big hood to hide yer ugly face, an'
dialog: slits for yer nasty little eyes.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS has to push his way to the car, knocking BIGGSY aside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIGGS
dialog: Oh steady, rocky...
text: CHRIS joins CAZ in the car.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Give us a lug of that... nice...
dialog: 
text: CAZ hands a spliff to CHRIS.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 24 INT. CAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: As CAZ pulls out of the estate, the gang make various
text: obscene, trouser-drop style gestures.
dialog: 
text: CAZ reverses sharply to make them jump out of the way. CAZ
text: remains cool throughout. CAZ puts a tape on the car
text: cassette. The Blackbyrds: 'Time Is Moving On'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You don't think they 'ad anything to do
dialog: wiv the murder?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Leave it out, just the usual windin' us
dialog: up.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS isn't totally convinced.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yer neva can tell wiv Biggsy's lot.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: No, but if'e has had anything to do wiv
dialog: it, I'll break his fucking neck.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I didn't tell ya, did I? I had a word wiv
dialog: Ken about the A.H. He's on the case.
dialog: 
text: They slap hands, back to the mood of anticipation...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 25 INT. THE CRYPT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A club in the crypt of a church. The odd tomb and engraved
text: stone plaque remains, and the arches allow for small,
text: disparate groups to appear in, then disappear from view.
dialog: 
text: It's a young, mixed crowd, 50% black, 50% white. Mixed gay
text: and straight, male and female, punk and soul. Most of the
text: white crowd are punks. The punks stand round the edges like
text: clumps of decaying flowers.
dialog: 
text: CAZ and CHRIS move towards a raised altar-like platform.
text: Two female PUNK DJs are behind the decks, playing X-Ray
text: Spex: 'Oh Bondage Up Yours', a strong punk dance number:
dialog: 
text: Punks pogo furiously on the dance-floor.
dialog: 
text: There is a bit of banter between CHRIS, CAZ and the punk
text: DJs as CAZ sets up a second table, ready to fadeout the
text: X-Ray Spex. CHRIS digs through his record collection. He
dialog: selects The Players Association: 'I Like It?'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: This is Chris...
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: And this is Caz.
speaker_heading: CHRIS and CAZ
dialog: Soul Patrol.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You like it, 'I Like It' ...
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Players Association.
dialog: 
dialog: The Players Association: 'I Like It' draws the soul crowd
text: from behind the stone pillars to the dance-floor. Some of
text: the punks move away, others shift into the soul-dancing,
text: an altogether more engaged and stylish dance.
dialog: 
text: As the record continues, the floor fills. The dancing is
dialog: close. The unique and extraordinary mix of the seventies'
text: soul clubs emerges - girls dance with girls, boys with
text: boys, girls with boys, punk with soul, black with white...
text: A long, held view of the dance.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS and CAZ touch hands as they see the crowd get down.
text: They're at their closest in creating the club atmosphere.
text: People join in and add to the music - with whistles,
text: tambourines and shouted 'whoop/whoop' sounds.
dialog: 
text: TRACY and JILL from Metro Radio arrive, unseen by Chris.
text: They stand at the edge of the dancefloor. TRACY looks a
dialog: little out of place here, her South Molton Street style
dialog: too upmarket for this crowd. She is a bit older, a bit
dialog: classier, less street.
dialog: 
text: JILL might be the right class, but her clothes are markedly
text: high-street. She openly stares at the clubgoers, it's clear
text: she hasn't been to a club like it. JILL and TRACY knock
text: back their fist drinks. JILL, in for a penny attitude,
text: pulls TRACY to the dancefloor.
text: CHRIS sees the two women making their way through the
text: dancers, finding a space. TRACY edges their dance towards
text: the DJ rostrum. Towards CHRIS. CHRIS goes down to meet
text: them, without saying a word to CAZ.
text: He dances alone at first, he's a good, vain, self-absorbed
text: dancer. He dances alone till he knows TRACY'S attention is
text: firmly on him. He then breaks the pose and steers himself
dialog: close...
dialog: 
text: CAZ watches as the trio of CHRIS, JILL and TRACY forms.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS looks across to CAZ at the deck, breaks from the
text: dance. TRACY continues to dance with JILL, but watches as
text: CHRIS rejoins CAZ at the deck. CAZ and TRACY exchange looks.
text: JILL is distracted by styles and colours, ears pierced with
text: multiple ear-rings, 'granny shoes', tight jeans, baggy
text: trousers tightened at the ankles, plastic sandals, cowboy
text: boots, pointed shoes, collarless shirts, ripped fish-net
text: stockings, jackets made out of plastic bags, maxi-skirts,
dialog: mini-skirts... and that's just the soul crowd! A PUNK then
text: catches her attention, he wears a pair of Union Jack briefs
text: tacked to his jacket. He notices as she laughs.
dialog: 
text: TRACY tries to smile at CHRIS, but CAZ is in the way, and
text: when he's with CAZ, CHRIS seems to be avoiding her.
dialog: 
text: A BLACK BOY, his hair dyed blond, wearing a very thick,
text: purple mohair jumper, dances up to TRACY. She accepts the
text: unspoken invitation to dance. Though the dance involves
text: holding hands, there is a distance between them. JILL jumps
text: around with THE UNDERPANT PUNK, sending him and his dance
dialog: style up...
dialog: 
text: The pattern on the dancefloor changes. People form two
text: circles. In the first - two black boys and a white boy. In
text: the second - a black boy and black girl. We lose sight of
text: JILL and TRACY. CHRIS and CAZ sort through their records,
text: CHRIS keeps an eye open for TRACY. It's a while before he
dialog: speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Did ya see that girl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: What girl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: The one I was dancin' with. Tracy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: She's the one I was tellin' ya about...
dialog: works at Metro.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: She's well out of your league. What ya
dialog: ask her down 'ere for?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Do I object to your friends comin' down 'ere?
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Na. Nice to be liberated, ain't it?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Look Caz, I didn't mean it like that.
dialog: Hey... What ya sayin'?
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Rum and coke, large!
dialog: 
text: CAZ fades out The Players Association, fades in: Funkadelic:
dialog: 'One Nation Under A Groove'.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS leaves CAZ at the turntable. CHRIS pushes through the
text: dancers, disappointed not to see TRACY. Quite close to the
text: DJ platform there's a small group of PUNKS. BILLIBUDD, the
text: punk who tried to score at the garage, is one of them.
dialog: 
text: BILLI has his eyes fixed on CAZ. CAZ notices the cruisy
text: stare and smiles.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS sees JILL and the PUNK, he laughs as she interrogates
text: the soft-spoken, middle-class, art-school boy. JILL knocks
text: back the drink. She nods at CHRIS but her attention is on
text: the two men behind him - the men are kissing.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS finds TRACY. She's talking to the PUNK DJs. He
text: hovers, waiting for a chance to speak to her alone. KEN,
text: the equipment dealer, bumps into CHRIS. KEN looks out of
text: place in the club, he's more an East End pub disco type. He
text: manages to slop beer onto CHRIS's shirt in the crush near
text: the makeshift bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Shit. Ken! Watch it wiv the drink...
dialog: 
text: TRACY notices the drink incident.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Sorry... Sorry... Thought I'd come and
dialog: check the club... spoke to Caz 'bout the
dialog: aerial today... I'm working on it. Look,
dialog: let me get you a drink...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No. No, Ken... No...
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: What, yer busy ?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah... Yeah...
dialog: 
text: CHRIS is clearly annoyed about the shirt, and he wants to
text: be on his own with TRACY. KEN gets the message and leaves.
text: CHRIS turns to face TRACY.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'm getting 'em in. Tracy. Do you want a
dialog: drink?
dialog: 
text: TRACY holds up her full glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I've got one thanks... It's a bit mad in
dialog: here, nice though!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, listen Tracy, gimme a shout before
dialog: you leave, yeah?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: You're not going to join us?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'm gettin' one in for Caz. I'll see you
dialog: afta, yeah?
dialog: 
text: CHRIS smiles and leaves, pushing through to the bar.
text: Everybody knows him. He turns down the gestured 'Let's
text: dance' from two guys doing the bump at the edge of the
dialog: dancefloor.
text: DISSOLVE: To much later in the evening.
dialog: 
text: JILL and TRACY are well plastered. JILL tries to avoid the
text: now rather pressing attentions of the PUNK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Stop it...
dialog: 
text: She steers TRACY into a quiet corridor, away from the
dialog: dancefloor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What are you like?... So what do you
dialog: think of the Crypt then Jill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: It's good. I've never been to a
dialog: coloured... a black club before. Not to
dialog: mention one wiv blokes kissin' in it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: It's only fashion, Jill...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Nah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I'm only kidding... !
dialog: 
text: JILL laughs.
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: You know what Trace, when you first
dialog: started at Metro I thought you was a bit
dialog: of a snob... but we've 'ad a good laugh,
dialog: ain't we?
dialog: 
text: CHRIS, seeking TRACY out, interrupts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Tracy, Tracy..... So what you hidin' from,
dialog: eh?
speaker_heading: JILL
text: A punk in red, white and blue underpants!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: My God, you 'ad his trousers off?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: No! They was on the back of his jacket!
dialog: 
text: They move back towards the dancefloor, laughing. But CHRIS
text: clearly wants to talk to TRACY, JILL is a bit in the way.
text: She registers the fact.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: God, I can see when I'm not wanted.
dialog: 
text: A PUNK places his arm round JILL's neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: Oi, get dancing!
dialog: 
text: They move into the dance.
dialog: 
text: Later: CHRIS and TRACY in mid-conversation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: ... I don't know... I want to extend
text: it to clubs. What's really happening.
dialog: They've got no idea at Metro. The
dialog: programme is dead.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah... so what you suggestin' then?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I'm suggesting that you make up a tape,
dialog: and leave the introductions to me.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I'm sick of being a PA I want to make
dialog: some changes Chris. Are you interested?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, you bet!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: LATER IN THE EVENING. CHRIS at the decks. JILL and TRACY
text: dancing together, JILL getting a bit out of order,
text: enjoying herself hugely.
dialog: 
text: CAZ is by the bar. He talks to IRVINE, a young black man.
text: IRVINE is dressed in red, skin-tight jeans with see-through
text: plastic pockets and a bright green top. In spite of being
text: very much dressed for the club, he's visibly low.
dialog: 
text: As they talk KEN passes by. CAZ ignores him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: It's jus' the thought of T.J. lyin'
dialog: there... That boy could really dance...
speaker_heading: IRVINE
dialog: Don't think about it, girl, don't do no
dialog: good!
dialog: 
text: CAZ laughs at the 'girl'. He looks over to a fairly quiet
text: dancefloor, then up to CHRIS. CHRIS catches the look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CHRIS changing the record to the fast and funky sound of
dialog: War: 'Me and My Baby Brother'.
dialog: 
text: A line of dancers, predominantly black, forms. They bump
text: with shoulders, hands, hips, groins - the speakers
dialog: tremble.
dialog: 
text: CAZ and IRVINE join the dance. They give the dance
dialog: everything they've got... an undefeated, controlled yet
dialog: wild dance.

scene_heading: 26 EXT. GRAVEYARD/STREET BY CLUB - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CAZ and CHRIS carry record cases through the churchyard to
text: the nearby sidestreet. They pass TWO PUNK WOMEN kissing.
text: Jill's UNDERPANT PUNK sits looking startling and miserable
text: on a tombstone. Most of the club crowd have gone. They're
text: still half dancing as they pack up for the night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Now that was... Soul Patrol... Soul
dialog: Patrol ...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: That was a cool night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah... Listen Caz. I wanna make a tape
dialog: up, somebody asked me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: So what you up to now Chris?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Nothin'... Jus' need a few of the records.
dialog: Some of the imports. I'll get the last
dialog: lot...
dialog: 
text: CHRIS goes back to fetch the rest of the records. CAZ knows
text: he's up to something, and he's annoyed about it.
text: A COUPLE of MEN stagger up to the car.
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: Where'd yer get the motor, man?
speaker_heading: MAN 2
dialog: Look at that car, man!
text: CAZ jumps in the car and drives off. CHRIS is stranded with
text: four boxes of records.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Caz! Where are you? Shit!
dialog: 
text: TRACY is parked across the road, she laughs at his burst of
text: temper. CHRIS steps to the car, leans in at the open window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What's with your friend?... Need a lift?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Caz has got the 'ump. Can I put the
dialog: records in the boot?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Thanks... Nice car...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: TRACY gets out, opens the boot. CHRIS puts the records in.

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: So where's yer mate, Jill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Doing it with that punk!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Nah!
speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Tracy... Can I trust yer?
speaker_heading: TRACY

speaker_heading: CHRIS

dialog: 
text: CHRIS gets in the passenger seat. TRACY drives...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 27 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Torchlight. Searching the cluttered shelves. The light
text: rests on T.J.'s cassette player where CHRIS left it.
dialog: 
text: The gloved hand of the intruder grabs the cassette player.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 28 EXT. STREETS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CAZ drives. On the car cassette: Dr Buzzard: 'I'll Play the
text: Fool'. A crossover song, a mix of soul and disco, with
text: elements of the big band dance sound.
dialog: meet a guy/ain't it funny.../
dialog: keep on dancing... keep on dancing...
dialog: 
text: He halts at a set of traffic lights. In the car alongside,
text: BILLIBUDD - the punk from the garage and the club. CAZ and
text: BILLIBUDD exchange glances.
text: The lights change. BILLI changes lane, pulls ahead...
text: CAZ's car eventually following BILLIBUDD's.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 29 EXT. EDGE of PARK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: BILLIBUDD locks the door on his car, he looks round to see
text: if he has been followed. He climbs the fence, moves into
dialog: the Park.
text: CAZ drives to the edge of the Park, pulls up behind
text: BILLIBUDD's car.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 30 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: TRACY and CHRIS stumble through the garage in the dark.
text: They're laughing, a bit drunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Well, there's not much to it, is there?
dialog: Through here?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah, yeah...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: God, it reminds me... I used to listen to
dialog: Caroline a lot... I even remember Radio
dialog: 390, the R & B show.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That dates you.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Shut up!
dialog: 
text: TRACY knocks the punch-bag at CHRIS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Missed!
dialog: 
text: CHRIS leads her through the broken down car, into the
text: hidden pirate radio base.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Fancy having a radio station at the back
text: of a garage.
dialog: 
text: Once they're through to the base, CHRIS seems awkward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Tracy, er... would you like to... are you
dialog: going to... you could stay you know
dialog: and... save me...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What, here? No chance! You're joking...
dialog: 
text: They kiss. CHRIS is all for going further.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hey, I've got work in the morning. And
dialog: you're gonna make me a tape, remember?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah... Right... Yeah...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 31 EXT. EDGE OF PARK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CAZ listens, there is a man following him.
text: CAZ is near the murder spot. There is little light. The
text: footsteps are unnerving. Something of the tension of the
text: opening scene... But it is BILLIBUDD who follows him. They
text: turn to face each other. BILLIBUDD untucks CAZ's top.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: You pick your places, don't ya? You heard
dialog: what happened?
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: I heard.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Ya like living dangerously?
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: I just wanna show the bastards - I ain't
dialog: stoppin' comin' 'ere. Brought this with
dialog: me. Get them in the eyes if there's any
dialog: trouble.
dialog: 
text: BILLIBUDD brings out a small anti-perspirant spray can. CAZ
dialog: laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Any good trouble and ya'll smell nice
dialog: afta!
dialog: 
text: BILLI laughs. He presses the spray, in play. BILLIBUDD
text: moves to kiss CAZ. To get into his trousers. CAZ is still
text: on edge.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Not now, not now. Not here... it feels a
dialog: bit weird. Give us yer number.
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Yeah, yeah... I've heard that before.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Nah, it feels a bit weird... Give us your
dialog: number... I mean it.... I mean it...
text: BILLI takes out a felt tip, he lifts up his t-shirt....
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Your number. Write it here!
dialog:

scene_heading: 32 EXT. STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The back of a MAN in a telephone booth. The MAN disguises
text: his voice, muffles it.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Listen... I was there... he mugged him.
dialog: His name's Chris Morgan. I think he lives
dialog: on the Ladywell... No - I can't give
dialog: my... no names... right?... No... no.
dialog: 
text: The MAN slams the phone down.
text: At the MAN's feet - T.J.'s radio/cassette recorder. He
text: picks it up, leaves the booth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 33 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CHRIS runs the tap of a makeshift shower. He sticks his
text: head under it. He notices the big beer stain on his shirt.
text: He takes the shirt off, tries to get the stain out with
dialog: soap. It won't go.
dialog: 
text: He curses and returns to the deck. He works fast, by
text: lamplight, to compile a tape. He links the songs with a
text: DJ's patter. He listens to part of the tape, already
dialog: finished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Uncut funk at he bop... coming to you
text: directly from the Mother Ship... on top
dialog: of the chocolate Milky Way... five
text: hundred thousand kilowatts of P Funk.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: This one's dedicated to all you East
dialog: London funketeers out there,
dialog: Parliament... P. Funk... we funk, you've
dialog: got the funk...
dialog: 
text: Parliament: 'P. Funk Wants To Get Funked Up' plays.
dialog: 
text: CUT TO: CHRIS reaches for a fag, but he's out. He seems
text: stuck for an idea. Finally he remembers the tape his sister
text: gave him. He looks across to where he left the cassette
text: recorder. He notices it has been moved, he's not unduly
dialog: concerned.
dialog: 
text: He took the tape out, he has it. He plays the park tape,
text: lets it run beyond the song: 'Running Away'.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the WHITE MAN (MURDERER's VOICE) can be heard,
text: albeit a bit muffled and crackly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WHITE MAN
dialog: Like it down 'ere, do yer? Come down 'ere

scene_heading: 36 EXT. GARAGE FORECOURT - EARLY MORNING
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: 37 INT. GARAGE - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: A MAN'S gloved hand. A tense, stealthy movement of the MAN
text: through the garage.... CHRIS's feet protrude from the
text: backseat of the winched up car. He's fast asleep. The MAN's
text: head is covered with a metal mask.
dialog: 
text: The gloved hand grabs at Chris's feet, making him jump...
text: But the hand is DAVIS's the gloves, work gloves. The mask -
dialog: for car repair/welding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVIS
dialog: Yo!
speaker_heading: CHRIS

dialog: 
scene_heading: 38 EXT. TUBE STATION - MORNING
dialog: 
text: At the tube CHRIS has to push past FIVE POLITICOS. A youth

dialog: 'Anarchy in the UK' slogan.
dialog: 
text: The youth turns round, his front lapel is covered in
text: badges... like a noticeboard for the left of 1977. It's
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS half-recognises him from the garage. He catches hold
text: of BILLIBUDD'S lapel, peers at the badges: various
text: distorted images of the Royal Family, Mary Whitehouse with
text: 'Gay News Fights On' across her features, Punk badges,
text: Grunwick support, Stuff the Jubilee... But CHRIS takes
dialog: issue with one badge in particular.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: So disco sucks, does it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Mindless, capitalist crap!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Depends how you use it. Don't it?
dialog:

speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Should be something there you could dance

dialog: 
text: She starts to read from a leaflet, a list of recent racist

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASIAN PUNK
text: Like two Somalis burnt to death, arson.
text: Like flats doors kicked in, windows
dialog: broke. Like Bengali schoolkids getting
text: their faces kicked in. Join a picket
dialog: 'bout police indifference?
dialog: 
text: She hands CHRIS the roneod leaflet. CHRIS looks it over, it
text: is a long and horrific catalogue of attacks. CHRIS takes a
text: few copies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Alright, alright. Look, I'll place a few

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Ready for the verdict?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: It's pretty obvious, ain't it? I mean the
dialog: tape wasn't exactly professional...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Stop worrying Chris. I told him you made
dialog: the tape up last night. It's only an
dialog: impression he's after. I think I'm
dialog: getting somewhere with this club idea...
dialog: And, er... can you keep quiet about your
dialog: pirate credentials? He's dead set against
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CHRIS

dialog: Take a pew Chris. Yes, well, nice choice
dialog: of music, if a bit obscure. But you come
dialog: over well. It's just that it's a bit, um
dialog: - how shall I say, er - casual. I mean
dialog: not everybody will understand what you're
dialog: trying to convey. I like it, but the
dialog: powers that be... Listen, Chris - to be
dialog: honest with you - if we were to take you
dialog: on as a presenter - out and about in the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CID MAN
dialog: Not impressed. 'Wiv me mate'. And do you
dialog: think that'll hold? Suppose I tell you
dialog: that you were seen, you and your mate, by
dialog: the Park that night? Drives a Triumph,
dialog: right?
dialog: 
text: This catches CHRIS off-guard. If he tells them he and CAZ
dialog: were broadcasting, then it gives the pirate away. Now he
dialog: has to lie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: So what? It's the truth I'm telling ya.
dialog: I want my phone call. You ain't got
dialog: nothing on me.
dialog: 
text: The CID MAN opens a cupboard. He takes the badly burnt
text: cassette recorder out of a plastic bag. He holds it (in
text: gloved hands) to CHRIS's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CID MAN
dialog: Seen it before?
dialog: 
text: CHRIS is now totally unnerved, he has handled the recorder,
dialog: but if he says he has...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CID MAN
dialog: No? Your kid sister has. She was seen
dialog: with it in the Park, before you burnt it,
dialog: that is. Panicked did you? Tried to burn
dialog: your dirty black paw marks off it, did
dialog: you?
dialog: 
text: CHRIS looks across to the PARK POLICEMAN, furious at what
text: appears to be a set-up, and furious that Trish has been
text: involved. He shouts out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You bastards. Bastards! What ya doin'
dialog: gettin' at a nine year old kid?
speaker_heading: CID MAN
dialog: You're calling me a bastard. You'd kill
dialog: to get your filthy muggin' hands on a bit
dialog: of plastic. Kill one of your own. I say
dialog: one of your own, not that you'd see it
dialog: that way you being a half-breed, a
dialog: mongrel...
dialog: 
text: CHRIS can't take it. He screams out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I want my phone call, my phone call, my
dialog: phone call!
dialog: 
text: CHRIS thumps on the table... repeats his demand over and
text: over... his movements restrained by a POLICEMAN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CID MAN
dialog: Went back to find it, didn't you?
dialog: Whatever your little sister says. She
dialog: stuck up for you, so just who is
dialog: involving kids in this? Give the coon his
dialog: call...
dialog: 
text: The CID MAN lights a cigarette, and casually leaves. A
text: POLICEMAN places the phone in front of CHRIS and leaves.
text: CHRIS is left on his own.
text: He picks up the phone, tries a number, mutters 'Caz, Caz'
text: into the receiver. Panic in his voice. There is no reply.
text: He slams down the receiver. Picks it up again and dials.
dialog: 
text: He half-sings a Metro Radio jingle, to jog his memory. The
text: jingle incorporates the station's number. He dials the
dialog: number.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hello... can I speak to Tracy... no...
dialog: no... no I don't know her surname... she
dialog: works on the 'In Town Tonight' show. Look,

speaker_heading: CAZ

speaker_heading: CHRIS

text: Tilt down: the dizzying height of the block, the ground far
dialog: below.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS clings to the aerial, CAZ grabs him, carefully pulls

speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: You were nearly a gonna, man! Right, no

dialog: and get down.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Thanks, man.

text: the roof to go back down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Oh... yeah... Tracy fixed up a meeting
dialog: with this producer down Metro. It was her
dialog: that got me out of the nick.

scene_heading: 60 EXT. STREETS NEAR ESTATE - DAY
dialog: 
text: CAZ and BILLIBUDD walk near the estate. BILLIBUDD stops as
text: they near area the drive-way into the estate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: So why are we stoppin'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Thought we'd drop in on the party.
dialog: 
text: BILLI reaches into his canvas bag full of leaflets and
dialog: newspapers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Oh yeah, thinkin' of doin' a bit of
dialog: canvassin' are we? Forget it...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Course not. Caz. Course not. Just thought
dialog: I'd tell a few more people about the
dialog: concert, you know? Funk the Jubilee! Caz
dialog: at the controls - right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Spare me, Billi...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Don't worry 'bout it, I'll be a good boy.
dialog: I won't be an embarrassment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Embarrass yaself as much as you like.
dialog: Just leave me out of it.
dialog: 
text: A MAN in DRAG from the estate JUBILEE party glares at them.
text: At evident gayness, at punk versions of the Queen (on
text: BILLI's shirt), at black and white boy together. He forgets
text: the incongruity of his own get-up. CAZ follows BILLI into
dialog: the estate.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 61 INT. GARAGE/RADIO - DAY
dialog: 
text: CHRIS moves towards the radio base at the back of the
text: garage. He calls for CAZ. There is no reply.
dialog: 
text: With a shock he sees a mesh of brown tape curled up round
text: his feet. There is brown tape everywhere. Their every
text: cassette has been unwound and ruined. Roughly spelt out in
text: cut-up tape - an NF sign.
dialog: 
text: Shards of broken cassette boxes crack under CHRIS's feet.
text: Yet the records and the equipment are left intact. CHRIS is
text: totally unnerved.
text: Nevertheless he climbs through the wrecked car entry to the
text: pirate base. He switches the turntable. He carefully
text: selects a record, steadying himself. Puts on headphones.
text: He picks up the mike, begins to play Funkadelic: 'One
text: Nation Under A Groove'. His voice is fragmented, shocked.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: 'One Nation Under A Groove'... and most
dialog: of all right now... we're going out to my
dialog: main man, Caz... Funk the Jubilee... Hold
dialog: tight... The groove's travellin' on the
dialog: park tonight... Main man Caz is gonna
dialog: be... funkin' the Jubilee...An' if you
dialog: ain't gonna be there... you ain't gonna
dialog: be nowhere... I'll see you later Caz...
dialog: nuff luv...
dialog: 
dialog: The song goes on:
dialog: 
dialog: ... this is a chance/this is a chance/
dialog: to dance your way/
dialog: out of your constrictions/...
dialog: With the groove/our only guide/
dialog: we shall all be moved...
dialog: One nation under a groove/

scene_heading: 62 EXT. ESTATE JUBILEE PARTY - DAY
dialog: 
text: CAZ and BILLIBUDD at the street party, enclosed in the
dialog: estate courtyard.
dialog: 
text: The estate has been transformed into a riot of red, white
text: and blue. Flags everywhere. Tables decked out for a meal,
text: stalls selling all manner of Jubilee junk.
text: Children take turns to sit inside a huge gold-sprayed
text: carriage made of cardboard and crates. They sit in serious
dialog: mimicry of royals.
text: A YOUNG BLACK BOY cuts through the crowd on his chopper
text: bike, riding directly at the carriage. Handlebars fill the
text: screen. He looks set to crash but skids and steers sharply
text: to avoid it. On the back of the bike - a Union Jack,
text: blowing in the wind.
text: Many of the party-goers are in fancy dress, from BEEFEATERS
text: to ELVIS PRESLEY. BILLI relishes the sight, can't wait to
text: send it up. He heads for a stall and grabs a Jubilee fan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: This is nice. How much is this? Just the
dialog: right thing for my 'friend'.
speaker_heading: STALLKEEPER
dialog: Get yer bleedin' 'ands off...
dialog: 
text: BILLIBUDD heads down past a row of stalls, finally pausing
dialog: at a goldfish stall. Ball in the bowl and you win a
dialog: goldfish.
dialog: 
text: The GOLDFISH STALL MAN struggles to keep control as BILLI
text: pokes at the fish prizes in their polythene bags.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: This is cruelty to animals. How'd you
dialog: like to be stuffed up in a plastic bag?
dialog: This your idea of fun, is it? You're sick,
dialog: you are.
text: BILLI turns his attention to a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE, he
text: proffers a copy of Socialist Worker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Oi... Socialist Worker, right? Stuff the
dialog: Jubilee ... the only paper for the
dialog: working class... look, we're having a
dialog: party down the park, why don't yer come
dialog: down, have a look?
dialog: 
text: The MAN pushes BILLI away.

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Just piss off...

speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Hi... blimey... what 'appened?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Not now Ken, I'm in the middle of a show,
dialog: mate.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: D'yer call the police?
text: CHRIS shakes his head,'No'.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Nah, it's no use... no use...
text: KEN calmly closes in on CHRIS.
text: Suddenly KEN smashes out, pushing CHRIS over the desk...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What yer doin'... ?
text: KEN knocks the tape deck to the floor.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: You know wot I want. You fuck me about
dialog: and I'll kill yer.
dialog: 
text: KEN has CHRIS by the throat, he tightens his grip.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Always thought you were so smart, didn't
dialog: yer? Well I set you up... I set you up
dialog: nicely...
text: CHRIS struggles... KEN's speech is disjointed, a struggle
dialog: to force the words out...
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Since when've you fuckin' cared? You
dialog: don't understand... you're not like
dialog: Caz... Thought I'd kill two birds with
dialog: one stone.... But pretty boy...
dialog:

speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: You pretty boy... You had to stick yer
dialog: nose in. Gimme the tape, Chris ...give me
dialog: the fucking tape!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I haven't got it...
dialog: 
text: CHRIS summons all his force to push KEN off. They fall to
text: the ground fighting.
text: CHRIS kicks out. Kicks KEN in the face...
text: CHRIS dives through the car at the back of the garage...

speaker_heading: BLUE RINSE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: National Front News...
dialog: 
text: ANN grabs the paper from the startled YOUNGER WOMAN. She
text: glances across the headlines: 'Hundreds of Thousands Turn
text: Out to Vote National Front!' ANN slowly tears the newspaper

dialog: 
text: TRISH and her FRIENDS are nearby.
speaker_heading: FRIEND
dialog: Trish, there's your Mum...
speaker_heading: TRISH

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Yeah...
dialog:

speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Here, come on, yer don't need that.

speaker_heading: PEARLY KING
dialog: It's a raffle, and you 'ave to 'ave a

speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: After Eights, huh?
dialog: 
text: BILLI puts down the chocolates and snatches the whole book

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEARLY KING

speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Whoa.. whoa... alright, hold on...
dialog: 
text: The PEARLY QUEEN grabs the book of tickets back.
text: BILLIBUDD reaches into his bag and pulls out a newspaper.
text: Starts his sales patter again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Have one of these. Socialist Worker ...
dialog: Only paper for the working class... look

speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Wait, wait, wait... So what's your
dialog: problem, eh? What's your problem?
dialog: 
text: Looking across at BILLIBUDD: perched on the rubbish sheds:
text: the skins, KELLY, BIGGSY, SPARKY...
text: BILLI continues to aggravate the PEARLY KING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Why don't you read this sometime? It
dialog: might educate yer.
speaker_heading: PEARLY KING
dialog: Go on .. on your way...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a beercan is hurled from the sheds, it catches
text: BILLIBUDD across the face. It cuts him just above the eye.
text: As BILLI holds his face a conga of Jubilee revellers curls
text: past him. The beercan carrying SKINS jump down to close in
speaker_heading: on BILLI.
dialog: 
text: CAZ arrives.
speaker_heading: SPARKY
dialog: Better get yer noo boyfriend 'art of 'ere
dialog: Caz, or else 'e might need carryin'...
text: BILLI is panicked. CAZ more casual about it. He can usually
text: handle SPARKY and Co. He pushes SPARKY and BIGGSY aside,
text: leads BILLI through the skins. CAZ ignores the taunts, the
text: crushing of cans, the gestures...
text: Safely away, CAZ rounds on BILLI. But at the same time as
text: he shouts he wipes the blood from BILLI'S face, tends him.
text: Some of the blood has dripped down onto the t-shirt image
dialog: of the Queen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: You stupid fuckin' wanker. You can't
dialog: listen to no-one, can ya?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: I was only doing my paper round, Caz!

speaker_heading: CAZ

speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: But I'm wiv you Caz.

speaker_heading: CAZ

speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD

speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Plenty of time for that. Let's get your

speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Why'd you keep calling me Blondie? I'm

speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Don't worry about it. You're near enough.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: 65 INT. BILLIBUDD'S FLAT - DAY
dialog: 
text: More flags on a wall, but these are inside, they're ripped
text: and defaced or plastered in punk imagery...
dialog: 
text: Billi's room is as much a shrine to Punk as the garage is
text: to Reggae - skip furnished, vinyl chairs and dead branches
text: of a tree forming a bed board of sorts.
dialog: 
text: BILLI comes into the room, an icepack over the cut on his
text: face, a beer bottle at his mouth. CAZ takes a cigarette.
text: BILLI puts on X-Ray Spex: 'Identity'. Climbs on the bed,
text: takes off his studded belt. CAZ laughs at the choice of
text: music, turns the record off.
speaker_heading: BILLI
dialog: Not the best idea... Agreed!
dialog: 
text: BILLI climbs off the bed. Kisses CAZ then sorts through his
text: mostly punk records, finally he finds a reggae song. Junior
dialog: Murvin: 'Police and Thieves'.
dialog: 
text: Another kiss. CAZ laughs at the attempt to seduce with
text: black music, the record goes the same way as the first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: 'Ow about quiet?
dialog: 
text: They walk towards the bed. CAZ takes off BILLI's shirt,
text: kisses the plaster on his face. Places his cigarette into
text: BILLI's mouth.
dialog: 
text: BILLI takes off CAZ's shirt. They move to the bed. BILLI
text: kisses CAZ's chest... and moves down his body.
text: Gulps of beer, drags at the cigarette, undressing... Then
text: the slow thump of serious pleasure.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 66 EXT. ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog:

speaker_heading: QUEEN
speaker_heading: (VOICE-OVER)
dialog: At the Silver Jubilee of 1935... and at

dialog: 
text: Flags flutter in the wind. The wind's dry metallic sound.
text: CHRIS runs into the estate.
text: Just a few JUBILEE STRAGGLERS are left, a couple heading
text: drunkenly home, a couple clearing the mess from their
text: doorsteps. CHRIS kicks a can along the ground.
speaker_heading: QUEEN
speaker_heading: (VOICE-OVER CNTD.)
dialog: ... the Empire and the Commonwealth came

scene_heading: 67 EXT. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Caz... You're Caz, aren't you? Chris's
dialog: other half, er, DJ spa, right? We never
dialog: did get properly introduced at the Club.
dialog: Where is he? Have you seen him?
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Yeah, he's my other half. An' you're
dialog: Tracy from Metro... I hear they're
dialog: letting us in now, one at a time. That's
dialog: really metropolitan of 'em...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: What are you talking about? I don't 'ave
dialog: to justify what I do to you.
dialog: 
text: TRACY takes in BILLI's 'clean' t-shirt. It features two
text: cowboys, naked from the waist down....
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
text: Chris was on the air this afternoon. It
dialog: seems he got cut off. Metro had any
dialog: pirates taken off the air lately, has it?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: Capitalist crap. Metro Radio.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Shut up, Billi.
speaker_heading: TRACY
text: Spending twenty pounds on T-shirts from
dialog: Vivienne Westwood has got nothing to do
dialog: with capitalism, hmmm?
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: It has to do with homoerotica. Nicked
dialog: homoerotica, actually. Like it?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Luv it. It's like Anarchy courtesy of
dialog: EMI... so rebellious... so St Martin's
dialog: School of Art... excuse me.
dialog: 
text: CAZ has to smile at the send-up of BILLI.
dialog: 
text: TRACY leaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Come on, Jill...
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: Coming...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 68 EXT. ESTATE - EARLY EVENING
dialog: 
text: CHRIS returns to the estate, still searching. Bunting
text: dropped from a balcony falls across his path.
text: A voice calls out to him.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Oi, soulboy!
dialog: 
text: CHRIS looks up to see SPARKY, KELLY and BIGGS.
dialog: 
text: Closing in on him.
text: CHRIS walks straight up to KELLY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Wot was they askin' yer down the nick?
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Wanted an 'alf caste. Told 'em they musta
dialog: got the wrong one.
speaker_heading: SPARKY
dialog: Oh dear, I forgot to wear me white suit.
text: CHRIS looks him up and down: the shaved head, Union Jack
text: t-shirt, the patriotic skinstyle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You look pretty white to me.
dialog: 
text: The gang laugh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPARKY
dialog: Shut up! Don't know why you're laughin',
dialog: Kelly.
dialog: 
text: KELLY stops laughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Kelly laughs at anythin','cos he knows
dialog: nothin'. And as long as he knows nothin',
dialog: he can make out he's whi...
dialog: 
text: KELLY shouts to drown the word 'white'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: Wot's it to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Ain't nothing to me, it's only yerself
dialog: yer connin'.
text: SPARKY smiles, enjoys CHRIS and KELLY arguing it out
text: amongst themselves. CHRIS knows SPARKY would relish a
dialog: fight.
dialog: 
text: Instead CHRIS walks up to KELLY, he grabs him, pulls him
text: close. CHRIS is too angry to be worried by any of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Why're you lying and hidin' all the time,
dialog: Kelly? They were pissing about wiv us
text: down at the station. Ken killed T.J. and
dialog: tried to pin it on us. You listenin'?
dialog: Have you seen Ken?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLY
dialog: I ain't seen him, Chris. Honest.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS lets go of KELLY, KELLY stumbles backwards.
text: SPARKY crashes a milk bottle to the ground, it smashes
text: close to CHRIS.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS starts to scream out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Caz. Where are you Caz?... Where are you?
dialog: ... Where are you?
dialog: 
text: The SKINS are confused and angered by Chris's behaviour,
text: there's none of the usual banter. Neighbours come out of
text: their doors, look down from their balconies. So many eyes
text: on them, the gang can't risk a fight. CHRIS keeps calling
text: for Caz. Even SPARKY is unnerved.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 69 EXT. PARK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: CHRIS runs into the Park.
text: He pushes through punks and hippy-types. Still shouting.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Where are you?
dialog: 
text: There are heaps of banners and placards round the edge of
text: the Park. Emblems of the Socialist Workers' Party, labour
text: groups and trades' councils, mixed with the punkier
text: graphics of the Anti-Nazi League. A sharp contrast to the
text: Estate Jubilee decorations. CHRIS stumbles through the
dialog: placards.
dialog: 
text: In the distance, a stage. A 'Fuck The Jubilee' banner
text: emblazoned across it. A short way from the main crowd,
text: CHRIS spots TRACY and JILL. JILL is dancing with TWO BLACK
text: WOMEN. Live music from an Asian band fills the Park.
dialog: 
text: TRACY catches sight of CHRIS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: There's Chris... Chris!...
dialog: 
text: CHRIS calls out to TRACY, TRACY leaves the WOMEN to reach
text: him. A blur of extraordinary images, seen selectively, in
text: fragments, through Chris's anxious eyes. The 'Fuck the
dialog: Jubilee' is as much a pageant as the Jubilee itself. People
text: are decked out in masks, in parodies of Jubilee costumes.
text: CHRIS pushes past the ASIAN GIRL PUNK, seen earlier with
text: Billibudd leafleting the tube. She is dressed as Britannia,
text: with spear and shield - an outfit to offend just about
dialog: everybody.
text: The ASIAN PUNK GIRL's friends wear satiric and grotesque
dialog: masks - of Callaghan, Steel...
dialog: 
text: Others wear clothes featuring distorted images of the Royal
text: Family. A small group wear cardboard corgi masks. Finally
text: TRACY reaches CHRIS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Chris!
dialog: 
text: CHRIS grabs hold of her arms. A panic in him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Ken did it... it was Ken... Listen...
dialog: something's gonna happen. I've gotta find
dialog: Caz...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Ssshhh... Slow down, Chris. Slow down.
dialog: What are you talking about, who's Ken?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Just help me find him...
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No Chris. No more. We're going. Have you
dialog: seen all the police? Vans loads of 'em,
dialog: all round the park. I don't like the look
dialog: of it...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Tracy... please...
dialog: 
text: CHRIS grabs TRACY, she sees all the fear in him and
text: follows. They head for the stage...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The stage. An Asian band pack away their instruments,
text: unaware of the growing chaos round the edges of the park.
text: They move to leave the stage for CAZ and BILLIBUDD to keep
text: the disco going between acts. The stage is stacked with
text: large, heavy speakers. Drum kits and electrical equipment.
text: CAZ steps up to the turntable, puts on a record.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: SPARKY and BIGGSY converge round the edge of the Park.
text: They mix with a group of older men - many of them seen
text: earlier in fancy-dress on the estate. A BEEFEATER, A
text: POLICEMAN amongst them. Whether the policeman is real or
dialog: not it's impossible to tell. The costumes make convenient
text: masks. The men hand round bulging plastic bags.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: CHRIS and TRACY in the crowd. SKINS steam into the
text: crowd... kicking people to the ground... CHRIS gets
text: pushed... he loses TRACY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Get off!... Tracy!... Tracy!
dialog: 
text: The surrounding fights get more vicious.
dialog: People, especially people with young children, are
text: beginning to panic...
text: Gangs of NF thugs pick out the armbands of the Anti-Nazi
text: League stewards, and move in to attack any who are on their
text: own. Some of the Anti-Jubilee revellers run to the
dialog: stewards' assistance.
text: The CID MAN from the police station is in the crowd,
text: watching, not moving to anyone's assistance.
text: A man wearing a BEEFEATER costume lights a petrol bomb.
dialog: 
text: CAZ and BILLIBUDD survey the growing chaos from the stage.
dialog: 
text: A petrol bomb, seen close, pulled from a carrier bag... it
text: hurtles through the air... a streak of light against a
text: darkening sky.
text: The bomb hits the stage... starting a fire.
text: BILLI jumps down, CAZ tries to save the records, but in the
text: middle of increasing chaos, some of the records spill onto
dialog: the mud.
text: Roll over the ground.
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Shit... Billi... the records ...
text: They have to make a run for it. The stage banner is in
text: flames. Floodlights crash down on the crowd ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: KEN runs into the Park. Pushes through the crowd. People
text: are running to get out.
text: ANN tries to reach the Park gates with TRISH.
text: KEN bangs into ANN and TRISH, he knocks TRISH to the ground.
text: ANN yells after him as she picks TRISH up.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Watch out... Are you all right?
dialog: 
text: She kisses TRISH, protects her as they move to get out.
dialog: 
text: They're surrounded by PUNKS and TEDS, PUNKS in anti-Nazi
text: t-shirts, others in confusing swastikas...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: YEOMEN of the GUARD, BEEFEATERS, HENRY VIII, SIR WALTER
text: RALEIGH, a group of heavily disguised men who work their
text: way systematically towards the stage.
text: Screams and chaos.
text: Some of the Anti-Jubilee crowd tear at the flags and
text: costumes of the Jubilee revellers. Carnival attacks
text: Carnival. The police wade into selective Anti-Jubilee
dialog: targets.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CHRIS nears the stage. KEN in pursuit.
text: Smoke billows up, CHRIS can't see whether CAZ is still
dialog: there.
text: SPARKY and BIGGS fall about laughing at the destruction.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CHRIS reaches the stage, only to find CAZ gone. He climbs
text: through flame.
dialog: 
text: Takes the Park cassette out of his back pocket. Screams
text: into the microphone. The chill sound of KEN and T.J. in the
text: opening scene, now broadcast across the Park.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I know you're here. Hear it!
dialog: 
scene_heading: VOICES ON TAPE:
dialog: T.J.
dialog: So leggo ma han'... I ain't into no rough

speaker_heading: VOICES ON TAPE (cntd):
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Just being friendly, tell us yer name.
dialog: 
dialog: T.J.
dialog: Man, you're one stubborn white bwoy.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS raises his arms to shield his face from the flames.
text: He sees KEN coming towards him.
dialog: 
text: KEN tries to protect himself with his jacket hood.
text: Suddenly part of the stage gives way under him. He
text: disappears in flame.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS manages to jump off the stage just before the whole
text: structure goes up in flame.
text: Screams from the crowd....
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Away from the stage area, the Park is emptying, quietening.
dialog: 
text: JILL cries. TRACY holds her, steadies her.
text: But there's also rage on TRACY'S face. Rage at the
dialog: destruction.
text: CHRIS finds them...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Tracy...
dialog: 
text: Not far away from CHRIS and TRACY, CAZ has covered his
text: ears in horror. BILLIBUDD touches CAZ's face. BILLI tries
dialog: to comfort him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLIBUDD
dialog: It's alright...
text: CAZ and CHRIS finally see each other...
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Chris... Chris...

text: Towards dawn.
dialog: 
text: JILL and BILLIBUDD gently clean the mud off records rescued
dialog: from the Park.
dialog: 
dialog: They've set up a kind of record repair production line.
text: TRACY takes the polished records, passes them onto CHRIS
text: and CAZ at the turntable. CAZ and CHRIS test the records
dialog: for playability, for scratches.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS turns to CAZ.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I wasn't runnin' from yer, Caz. We're
dialog: okay now, yeah? Soul Patrol again...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAZ
dialog: Come on...
dialog: 
dialog: The records continue to pass from hand to hand... JILL
text: steps out of the line to dance... TRACY joins JILL in the
dialog: dance.
