scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - BRUSSELS - MORNING
text: A songbird chirps outside.
text: Gazing out windows at a magnificent rooftop view of Brussels
text: in the hush before daybreak. To the right of the windows, a
text: vanity with a large mirror and a sleeping cat on its tabletop.
text: The naked, tangled bodies of a YOUNG WOMAN and an OLDER MAN
text: asleep on a bed can be seen in the mirror. A serene stillness
text: as the sun breaks and floods the bedroom with warm light.
dialog: SUPER: "Brussels, Belgium. March, 1976"
text: IN THE MIRROR we see the woman roused by the sun. A beat.
text: She beckons for his... Massages it to attention. Sliding up
text: his chest, she straddles him. Husky gasps as she gracefully
text: grinds down. The half-asleep man comes alive with her pleasure --
text: meets her movement, intensity building, their shuddered
text: breaths become one --- until he cums and they collapse
dialog: together...
text: ANGLE ON BED: sun-stroked lovers in a hazy embrace --- stoned
dialog: with satisfaction, comfort --- good morning.
dialog: DOMINIKA EGOROV: mid twenties, natural, effortless beauty ---
dialog: deep allure --- bohemian laissez-faire style and grace ---
text: Jane Birkin but with haunted eyes.
text: Next to her, COLONEL FRANCOIS GUILLOT, a Belgian man, 50s.
text: Kissing Guillot, Dom gets out of bed, grabs the portable
text: cassette player off the vanity --- a glance back at him as
text: she disappears into the bathroom.
text: Guillot leans to a chair, a NATO uniform hanging off it. He
text: pulls out a cigarette, lights up, takes a drag, smiles to
text: himself as we HEAR water running into a tub in the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - BEAT LATER
text: Dom in front of a mirror, not so much looking at herself as
text: she is for herself. An undercurrent of tension in her eyes.
text: Moving to the clawfoot tub next to a big window, Dom cuts
text: the water, hits play on her tape-deck: The Velvet
text: Underground's "Sunday Morning" --- slips into the bath.
text: The tension in her eyes disappears when Guillot enters. He
text: gets in the tub, sits across from her. They trade smiles.
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: When we're old and gray -- promise
dialog: me that we will still have mornings
dialog: like this. Always this --- forever.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: A proposal?
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: We only met 6 weeks ago.
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: But I've known you for a thousand
dialog: years ---
text: Dom rolls her eyes, a "so cheesy" look at Guillot. Putting
text: her feet on his chest, he soaps and lathers her legs up...
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: The NATO Colonel and the anti-war
dialog: activist --- an odd couple.
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: You're the ying, I'm the yang.
text: Dom grabs a safety razor, slowly begins to shave her legs.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: And what will your colleagues say?
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: What will yours?
dialog: (lock eyes with Dom)
dialog: I don't care. I want us to work.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: How am I to live happily ever after
dialog: with a career soldier?
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: I am a soldier for peace.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: Yes, whose job it is to promote the
dialog: proliferation of nuclear weapons ---
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: As deterrents!
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: Do you want our children to grow up
dialog: under the specter of annihilation?
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: Of course not ---
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: Then help me change things. You're a
dialog: soldier for peace? Prove it.
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: This is ridiculous. Prove it how?
text: Dom stops shaving, hard look at Guillot.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: Is the Defense Planning Committee
dialog: going to advocate the deployment of
text: Pershing II GLCM's along the curtain
dialog: line to counter Soviet SS-20's?
text: Guillot sits back and stares at her, stunned and confused.
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: I.. I'm sorry -- I can't answer that.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: You mean you won't...
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: You're deputy chief of NATO's Division
dialog: of Defense Planning and Policy. If
dialog: anyone knows, it's you.
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: How could -- I never told you I was
dialog: with the DDPP. We never discussed --
text: Dom's gaze unwavering as the realization hits Guillot like a
text: bat to the head.
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH) (CONT'D)
dialog: You're from the Center, aren't you?
dialog: You're from Moscow.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: If I were, would it make a difference?
text: He shuts his eyes, annihilated.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH) (CONT'D)
dialog: Francois ---
text: Guillot starts to cross his arms --- Dom leans in to touch
text: him, prevent him from closing up --- and he SLAPS her hard,
text: drawing blood. He recoils, horrified at himself, at her. Dom
text: remains calm, maintains eye contact.
speaker_heading: DOM (CONT'D)
dialog: There are snapshots of us, documents
dialog: that I photographed. (beat) If you
dialog: don't work for them, they have more
dialog: than enough to convince your
dialog: colleagues that you do ---
text: Guillot breaks down with a shattered, gallows chuckle.
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: A honeytrap. Pathetic. Can't trust
dialog: anyone anymore. Not even myself.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: I do care about you, Francois ---
dialog: let me help you through this.
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: What you do for a living -- it's the
dialog: worst fucking business in the world.
text: Dom nods. After a beat ---
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: But there's no other way out ---
text: Guillot suddenly snatches the safety razor...
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: There's always a way out.
text: Dom lunges for the razor, but Guillot JAMS his legs hard
text: against her chest and PINS her back. He pops out the blade,
text: looks her dead in the eye and brutally slits open his wrists.
text: Guillot roughly holds a struggling Dom still as a cloud of
text: blood gushes from his veins and into the water towards her ---
text: and after a minute or so, he finally releases her. Dom jumps
text: out of the bath, body stained with blood.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: You don't have to do this.
text: Guillot reclines to bleed out in comfort. Finally Dom turns,
text: wets a towel in the sink, quickly cleaning herself.
speaker_heading: GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
dialog: You can wipe the blood off, but you
dialog: and I will always be unfinished
dialog: business.
text: They share a last look. He turns to gaze out the window.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN FRENCH)
dialog: I'll let the cat out when I leave.
text: Dom leaves the bathroom. After a few beats, her footsteps
text: rushing out of the apartment -- she shuts the door. And then
text: all we can hear is a song bird CHIRPING outside.
scene_heading: SUPER TITLE CREDIT: "Red Sparrow"
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: Drab, cramped living room sullied with the rubble of an all-
text: night party. A pile of THREE NAKED BODIES passed out on the
text: floor. Woman's SNORES over a radiator's wheeze.
dialog: SUPER: "Two Months Later. Moscow, Soviet Union"
text: Sandwiched between two plump BRITISH CHICKS is NATE NASH, a
text: 30-something American with the wolfish, hardboiled good looks
text: of a prizefighter. Unkempt, counter-culture vibe.
text: Waking up, Nate squints at his watch: 8:47am -- shit. He
text: wiggles free and gathers his clothes.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - APARTMENT - BEAT LATER
dialog: 
text: In a brown corduroy suit, blue Lacoste shirt and military
text: boots, Nate turns the sink on, vigorously splashes his face.
text: On the counter: a new bar of soap and bottle Chanel perfume.
text: He sticks both in his jacket. The plump chick's panties and
text: bra hang over the tub. Nate pockets those too.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - APARTMENT - MINUTE LATER
dialog: 
text: Nate pops a couple of Dexedrine with some water --- then
text: grabs a half-eaten steak, four eggs, apples from the fridge ---
scene_heading: EXT. BRITISH EMBASSY COMPOUND - MOSCOW, USSR - MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: We suddenly hear the Rolling Stones' "Jiving Sister Fanny"
text: kick in --- as Nate exits the building next to the British
text: Embassy wearing a bucket hat and mirrored aviators.
text: Storm clouds rolling in, he flips his collar up, heads for
text: the gate. The EMBASSY SOLDIERS glare -- which Nate returns
text: with a snarky grin.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - JUST OUTSIDE BRITISH EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: MUSIC CONTINUING --- Outside the gate is a checkpoint guarded
text: by FOUR SOVIET MILITIAMEN. As Nate passes through, he smoothly
text: shifts into a hungover stagger.
text: Nate snap scans the street, casually clocks a VOLGA idling
text: down the block, two guys in the front seat.
dialog: 6.
text: Lumbering down the sidewalk, Nate suddenly keels over against
text: the wall and covertly sticks his finger down his throat.
scene_heading: INT. KGB VOLGA - STREET - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: MUSIC CONTINUING --- KGB#1 and KGB#2 chuckle as they watch
text: Nate puke then head to his car, a beat-up, tangerine Zhiguli.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. NATE'S ZHIGULI - MOSCOW STREETS - MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: Nate listens to the Stones off a jerry-rigged 8-track tape
text: player as he drives the drab and dreary streets. He cracks
text: the eggs over his mouth, swallows them whole -- powering up.
text: Sunday morning traffic, easy for Nate to clock his KGB
text: coverage: a rotation of 24 VEHICLES floating around him.
text: Nate memorizes characteristics of each car: dinged bumper on
text: the Volga, mismatched tire on the Lada van, etc...
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (mumbling to himself)
text: Fred and Barney in the dinged rear
text: bumper. Tom and Jerry, oddball tire --
text: Stopping at a red light, Nate's about to take a bite of steak
text: when the Volga behind him lurches forward and rear ends him ---
text: hurling Nate into the steering wheel...
text: Fucking pissed, Nate whips back to look at the smiling KGB#¥3
text: and KGB#4. Has to restrain himself from stomping ass.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fucking cocksuckers in the Volga...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - KITAY GOROD - MOSCOW - LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: The music ends as Nate parks his car, gets out and enters

scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - SANDUNOVSKY BANYA - LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: KGB#5 and #6, already in towels, sit on the bench behind
text: Nate as he disrobes, puts his gear into his locker. Wearing
text: his bucket hat and towel, Nate leaves, KGB agents trailing.
text: A beat later, more KGB AGENTS rush to Nate's locker. KGB#7
text: has a key, opens it and they rifle through his things. KGB#8
text: pulls the perfume, sprays it, smells -- pockets it.
text: KGB#7 pulls the bra and panties out, holds them up. The crew
text: gazes at them like they're looking into the face of god.
text: KGB#9 swipes the panties from KGB#7. A tussle busts out ---
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (IN RUSSIAN, O.S.)
speaker_heading: ENOUGH!
text: An annoyed KGB SKIPPER holds his hand out and they give him
text: the panties and bra.
speaker_heading: KGB SKIPPER (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Dust him and be done with it.
text: KGB#7 spritzes invisible NPPD dust on Nate's shoes, clothing.
scene_heading: INT. BANYA-STEAM ROOM - A LITTLE LATER
text: A large Banya steamroom packed to the hilt with Muscovites
text: sweating it out, shooting the shit. Nate sits on the 2nd
text: tier bench, boiling down good, KGB on either side of him.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (turns to KGB on right)
dialog: So the KGB, the GRU and the CIA all
dialog: think they're the world's best rabbit
dialog: catchers. To settle the matter, they
dialog: have a contest --- see how long it
text: takes each team to catch the rabbit.
dialog: The CIA is up first. They charge
dialog: into their forest and pay off all
dialog: the animals, place informants
dialog: throughout, vector every inch with
dialog: satellites -- and after 3 months of
text: working it, the CIA concludes that
dialog: the rabbit doesn't exist. Next, the
text: GRU team goes into their forest and
dialog: after a week with no leads they get
dialog: fed up and just drop a nuke on the
dialog: whole place, fucking vaporize
dialog: everything, including the rabbit. No
dialog: apologies. Fuck the rabbit, he had
text: it coming. Then, finally the KGB's
dialog: team goes into their forest --- and
text: they come out 10 minutes later with
dialog: this big old bear who's clearly had
dialog: the living shit kicked out him ---
text: missing his teeth, an eye, bleeding
text: out of his ass --- and the bear's
dialog: screaming: "Okay! Okay! I'm the
dialog: fucking rabbit! I'm the rabbit!"
text: Nate explodes with crazy laughter and to his delighted
text: surprise everyone in the steam joins him... Everyone but the
text: KGBs --- who struggle not to laugh. Nate tosses KGB#5 his
text: bar of soap --- marches out of the steam.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - ARBATSKAYA - MOSCOW - LATER - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Dark clouds loom. Nate ambles down the sidewalk toting an
text: umbrella, hyper-aware but feigning indifference. A BIG-NOSED
text: MAN averts his eyes as Nate walks past. Boom, motherfucker
dialog: just got made.
text: Nate approaches a CINEMA with "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's
text: Nest" on the marquee.
scene_heading: INT. CINEMA - MOSCOW - LATER
text: An over-packed old theater --- VIEWERS sit in the aisles,
text: stand against the walls. KGB#7&8 sit a few rows behind Nate.
text: All eyes on the last scene when the Chief kills McMurphy.
text: Credits roll, APPLAUSE. Everyone shuffles to the exit
text: simultaneously, creating a dense mob of bodies.
text: KGB#7 and #8 lose Nate, panic, shove through the crowd.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOVIE THEATER - MOSCOW - DUSK
text: Light rain. KGB#¥9 & #10 in their car across from the theater
text: watching the crowd exit. KGB#9 lifts a UV scope to his eye.
text: POV SCOPE: checking people's feet --- among the bustle, a
text: pair of shoes glows. PAN UP to see the back of Nate in the
text: rush as he opens his umbrella.
text: In a panic KGB#7 & #8 emerge from theater, hurry to the Volga.
speaker_heading: KGB#9 (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: (nods to Nate)
text: He's going to his car.
text: Relieved, they all hustle after him...
text: ANOTHER ANGLE: Amidst the hurrying throngs trying to get out
text: of the rain, we catch the back of a MAN strolling down the
text: block, trench coat collar popped, newsboy cap on. A gloved
text: hand holds an open umbrella.
dialog: As he distances himself, we now see this is Nate, no
text: sunglasses, different shoes -- he turns onto another street..
scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - ARBATSKAYA - MOSCOW - CONTINUOUS
text: SERIES OF QUICK CUTS: Nate moving down rainy avenues, back
text: streets, etc. Making sure he's clean of surveillance. He
text: turns down an alley, disappears behind a tall wood fence ---
text: A LOADING DOCK FOR A BUTCHER. Nate pulls two garbage bags
text: from a trash can. He opens one: a scrub brush and soap bottle.
text: Looping a hose off the awning, Nate showers, naked and
text: shivering -- furiously scrubbing his skin, nails, scalp...
text: Nate then opens the second bag, pulls out a towel, a new set
text: of clothes and shoes --- and a set of car keys.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. LADA - VARIOUS - MOSCOW - OVER NEXT FOUR HOURS
dialog: 
text: Nate in another car, a Lada. Pops a couple more Dexedrine.
text: QUICK SERIES OF CUTS: Nate driving through choke points,

dialog: the book... Nothing suspicious. He sold it, they bought it --
dialog: he's black.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - KRAMOVNIKI - MOSCOW - LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Nate cautiously approachs a desolate apartment block with a
text: messenger bag slung from his shoulder ---
text: Situational awareness peaking, pulse racing, Nate snap-scans
text: the street for anything suspect --- doesn't see anything. He
text: enters the building.
scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM - APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENT LATER
text: Nate enters the dimly-lit room, descends the steps, approaches
text: another door. KNOCKS softly. And from behind Nate a VOICE --
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Hands up --- above your head.
dialog: (Nate complies)
dialog: Now turn around please.
text: Nate slowly turns to find GRU MAJOR GENERAL VLADIMIR KORCHNOI,
text: a rugged, majestically-handsome man in his late-50s. Korch
text: gives him a hard once-over and takes out the same UV scope
text: the KGB used and carefully scans Nate for luminescence.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: (robust, elegant accent)
dialog: So how long was your run?
text: Nate holds out his hands to be scanned.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: 15 hours. Been black for the last 5.
text: Satisfied, Korch cracks a warm smile and pulls Nate into a
text: big, soul-brother bear hug and plants a big kiss on his cheek.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: I'm so happy to see you, my friend ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Me too, chico ---
scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM APARTMENT - APARTMENT BUILDING - BEAT LATER
text: Korch ushers Nate into a modest janitor apartment, removes
text: Nate's jacket, hangs it over a radiator and then SETS A

text: Nate opens his bag, pulls out a shrink-wrapped Russian
text: transistor radio, hands it to Korch.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Inside you'll find batteries for the
dialog: BUSTER, one time pads, new comm

speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: Yes, yes. Where is the good shit?
text: He gives Korch shrink wrapped bottle of Russian vinegar.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Old Rip Van Winkle. Finest Kentucky
dialog: bourbon available to mankind ---
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: Magnificent!
text: Nate pulls out four shrink wrapped records that have been
text: mocked up to look like they're Russian.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Cash, Elvis and my own contribution,
dialog: Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra.
dialog: You're gonna love it, trust me.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: I do. You and only you.
text: We HEAR Elvis Presley's "Gentle On My Mind", carrying us to ---
text: LATER: Nate and Korch at a table. Nate eats stew. Korch grooves
text: deep to the Elvis as he smokes.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: My wife, Anya, she hated Elvis ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Yeah? Why?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: For the very reason I love him ---
dialog: because he lives and sings straight
dialog: from his balls ---
dialog: (sad smile)
dialog: Thought he was vulgar.
text: Through the smile, Nate sees the pain in Korch's eyes.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: He's got a show up at the Hilton in
dialog: Las Vegas. You and I could be there
dialog: by August. Just say the word.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOLI
dialog: Someday perhaps, but for now, we
dialog: still have work to do. Which reminds
dialog: me, I must ask you something.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: No way. We save business for last.
dialog: That's the rule.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: This is extremely important, Nathan.
dialog: The subject of intense concern within
dialog: the Kremlin. It has to do with
dialog: Kissinger. Some distressing intel ---
text: even Breshnev is upset.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Upset about what?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: (a dramatic beat)
dialog: Is Kissinger fucking Raquel Welch?
text: Nate flashes a screw-headed grin, but Korch is stonefaced.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it true? Is he defiling her?
text: Nate's grin turns into giggles --- but Korch is insistent.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: Our sources say that Kissinger has a
dialog: lopsided cock which becomes quite
dialog: engorged when erect, is this how he
dialog: attracts them or just propaganda?
text: Nate's giggles roil into hysterical laughter...
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: How does this grotesque, little ghoul
dialog: of a man bed so many beautiful women?
dialog: I mean it, Nathan, if I could solve
dialog: this one mystery, Brezhnev would
dialog: make me Chief of the GRU...
text: Nate crying, grabs Korch's arm and starts affectionately
text: pounding on it. Korch can't help but start laughing too.

dialog: (lights cigarette)
dialog: It isolated a common dominator in

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: They all wanted a better life?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: Every one of them had a negative
dialog: relationship with his father, which
dialog: is strange, because I had a wonderful
dialog: bond with my father ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You think he'd see you as a traitor?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: He loved this country, a true patriot.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: So are you. You're betraying your
dialog: government in order to save your
dialog: people ---
text: Korch finds strength in the conviction in Nate's eyes.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: And you? You never speak of your
dialog: father ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Not much to say. I was a mistake to
dialog: the man. A bad beat. Only met once.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: He still alive?
dialog: (off Nate's nod)
dialog: Tragedy --- he'll never know what a

dialog: (deep sigh)
dialog: You're the only person in the world
dialog: I can talk to without having to think
dialog: about what I'm going to say before I
dialog: say it.
text: The DING ON THE COOKING TIMER goes off. Both men are
text: heartbroken that their night is coming to an end.
text: Korch pulls on gloves, takes off his boot and unfastens a

text: Korch dumps 42 rolls of microfilm into the bag. Nate's stunned
dialog: by the volume.

speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: This is too much. You shouldn't be
dialog: drawing so much exposure ---
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: I have it all well in hand...
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: But for how much longer? You've had
dialog: a spectacular, improbable run. Your
dialog: contribution is impossible to measure.
dialog: (beat) You've given us enough.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: If your commanders knew you were
dialog: saying this to me ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Yeah, I'd be shit-canned for sure.
dialog: But I don't want you to end up being
text: burned alive like Penkovsky.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: I won't ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Then let me get you out, we'll set
dialog: you up with a beautiful new life.
dialog: You should enjoy the time you have
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: Funny. I was planning on giving you
dialog: some very similar guidance ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: You don't think I know you're playing

speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: You've got too much left tit.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Listen, Vlad ---
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: (forceful)
dialog: No. You, listen. What do you truly
dialog: want out of life? Who do you want to
dialog: be? Where do you want to end up when
dialog: you are my age?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I don't know --- who the fuck has
dialog: time to think about that shit?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: You must make the time, Nathan ---
dialog: because it all goes by in the blink
dialog: of an eye.
text: Nate nods solemnly. Korchnoi reaches into his jacket, pulls
text: out a leather-bound book and offers it to Nate.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: Pavel Markova, a mystic poet, my
dialog: favorite. Read his epic "The Wolf
dialog: Hunt." Perhaps it'll help you
dialog: understand what I'm talking about.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You know I can't take that.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: It's okay. It's been wiped clean.
text: Nate takes the book, puts it and the bag of film into a secret

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - KRAMOVNIKI - MOSCOW - MINUTE LATER
text: Nate exits the building into the misty night. 3:30AM, city
text: asleep -- he crosses the street and heads down the block...
text: HEADLIGHTS turn onto the street, cruising towards him -- a

text: shuffle. The Militiamen pull up, eyeing him suspiciously,

speaker_heading: MILITIA #1 (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Nate pretends to be too fucked up to answer --- as he catches
text: the outline of Korch leaving the alley behind the apartment
text: and crossing through the adjacent field.
dialog: 15.
text: Militia#1 notices Nate's attention flicker and looks that
text: way, sees Korch's shadow, realizes something's up --- when
text: Nate savagely COLDCOCKS him twice ---
text: Nate BOLTS to a corner apartment block. Militia#2 explodes
text: from the car in hot pursuit, screaming into his walkie talkie.
scene_heading: INT. VARIOUS - APARTMENT BUILDING - MOSCOW - CONTINUOUS
text: Nate bursts into the building, frantically looking around
text: where to go --- scrambles up a stairwell --- a beat later,
text: Militia#2 busts in, hears Nate's footsteps, follows ---
text: SECOND FLOOR HALL Nate's at the end of the hall, trying to
text: open a big window, but can't. He picks up a trash can and
text: HAMMERS it against the glass --- spiderwebbing it. Just as
dialog: he's about to swing again ---
speaker_heading: MILITIA #2 (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: On your knees, hands behind your
dialog: head!
text: Militia#2 is aiming his gun at Nate from the stairwell. Nate

scene_heading: MOTHERFUCKER!
speaker_heading: MILITIA #2 (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: He's American! He's American!
text: Nate looks up, sees Militia #2 in the window yelling into
text: his radio. He scrambles to his feet and hobbles away ---
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEYWAY - MOSCOW - LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: Nate rushes into an alleyway, but it's a dead end. ANOTHER
text: PATROL CAR passes --- screeches to a stop, reverses, and
text: turns into the alley.
text: Headlights sweep over Nate as the Patrol Car accelerates
text: towards him -- Nate going all out -- the car rapidly closing
text: the gap -- MILITIA#3 and #4 open their doors, leaving Nate
dialog: no room --- going for a wall smear ---
text: Nate veers towards a drain pipe just as Militia#3 guns it
text: towards him.
dialog: 16.
text: Nate leaps, grabs the pipe and swings up just as the car
text: SMASHES into the wall, sideswipes the drainpipe and grinds
text: to a halt, pinning the passenger door closed.
text: The pipe gives way -- Nate drops onto the car's roof, rolls
text: onto the pavement.
text: Militia#3 opens the driver door, but Nate body checks it
text: shut on the guy's head --- once -- twice -- three times.
scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS - STREETS - MOSCOW - MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: The rains return. TIRE SQUEALS and ENGINE ROARS rise over the
text: water slapping asphalt, seemingly from all directions.
text: Wincing in pain, Nate moves in the shadows. The rain falls
text: harder, drowning out other noise. Patrols could be anywhere.
text: About to sprint to another alley, Nate suddenly freezes and
text: instinctively pulls back into the dark just as a KGB LADA
text: cruises by. He inches out, looks down the block ---
text: KGB, MORE MILITIA with flashlights and leashed DOGS. The
text: search for Nate intensifying exponentially...
text: Frantically scanning for his next move, Nate spots a storm
text: drain across the street -- a deluge flowing into it. He
text: hustles over, drops to his stomach and tries to squeeze
text: through the opening -- but he doesn't quite fit. He wedges
text: himself in, getting stuck -- THE TORRENT OF RUNOFF WATER
dialog: STARTING TO DROWN HIM --
text: With his last bit of strength, Nate pulls himself through
text: just as the KGBs patrol past the alley, sweeping their lights.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER - MOSCOW - CONTINUOUS
text: Nate TUMBLES 7 feet into the sewer --- old rusty rebar slicing
text: into his side before he splashes hard into a torrent of sewer
text: water. He immediately vomits from the overwhelming stench.
text: Pulls out a flashlight. The pipe running in either direction
text: is only three feet in diameter, half full with water/sewage.
text: With no choice, Nate bites on the flashlight, starts crawling
text: through the pipe, shivering, struggling to keep his head
text: above the rising river of shit. He crawls away from us,
text: flashlight growing dimmer until we can no longer see it...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOSCOW - CONTINUOUS
text: The KGB scours the area while questioning the Militiamen.
dialog: 17.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER - MOSCOW - LITTLE LATER
text: The pipe's filling up --- Nate can't keep his head above
text: water and move at the same time.
text: He stops, bracing himself, peers back and ahead. Flips on
text: his back -- a deep breath -- and lets go -- the torrent
text: carrying him away -- roughly spitting him into a CROSS-CHAMBER --
text: Coming up with a GASP, Nate tries to orient himself before
text: the raging current pushes him into another pipe --
text: He scrambles to grab onto a brick wall and SCRATCHES his way
text: to an iron ladder --- he latches onto it and pulls himself
text: up. Nate holds himself, trying to catch his breath.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOSCOW - MINUTES LATER
text: Nate emerges from a sewer onto a wide commercial street. Rain
text: has abated. Drained, freezing, he strains to pull the cover
text: back over the manhole. He cuts over to a side street.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - MOSCOW - MOMENT LATER
text: Nate holds his jacket up to the passenger window of a van
text: and PUNCHES it in. He opens the door, gets in.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - SIDE STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nate zips up a dirty jump suit, his wet clothes in a pile.
text: He rips out wires under the steering wheel, hotwires the
text: van, cranks the heat full blast, and starts driving.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. VAN - TCHAIKOVSKY STREET - MOSCOW - EARLY MORNING
text: Early morning. Nate turns onto Tchaikovsky St. and runs right
text: into a gnarly traffic jam. He peers into the distance at the
text: line of cars waiting to get into the US EMBASSY. Shit.
scene_heading: EXT. US EMBASSY - MOSCOW - CONTINUOUS
text: The large compound is surrounded by a tall brick wall topped
text: with razor wire. The entrance gate features two checkpoints,
text: the outer one manned by Soviet MILITIAMEN, the inner by US
text: MARINES. A line of cars slowly being waved through.
text: The Militiamen examine each car and trunk, checking all
text: occupants against a copy of Nate's diplomatic photo.
text: KGB AGENTS patrol along the lines of backed up cars, looking
text: in windows, their GERMAN SHEPHERDS sniffing around.
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. VAN - TCHAIKOVSKY STREET - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Nate's trying to figure out what to do. He looks over to the
text: embassy walls and is suddenly hit with a fucked idea ---
text: He rips the wheel around, peels over the sidewalk and parks
text: flush alongside the embassy wall ---
text: He grabs his jacket --- and a canvas tarp --- from the back ---
scene_heading: EXT. U.S. EMBASSY - MOSCOW - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Nate scrambles to the roof of the van --- sees a wave of
text: Militiamen and KGB agents screaming towards him on the street ---
text: He tosses his balled-up jacket up over the wall, then throws
text: the canvas tarp over the razor wire --- jumps up, grabs the
text: top of the wall and uses all his strength to pull himself up
dialog: and over the wall ---
scene_heading: EXT. INSIDE WALLS - US EMBASSY - MOSCOW - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Nate drops down, lands face first in a bush. A whole troop
text: of US MARINES bum rushes towards Nate, Ml6s drawn ---
speaker_heading: MARINES (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: DON'T MOVE! DON'T MOVE!
text: Nate throws his hands up. Recognizing Nate, MARINE#1 waves
dialog: the rest to stand down.
speaker_heading: MARINE#1
dialog: It's Nash, it's Nash.
text: They all walk over to help him up, but simultaneously stop
text: and recoil from his stench.
speaker_heading: MARINE#1 (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamn, Nash, you smell like the

dialog: 
text: A few CASE OFFICERS sit at desks along the walls. No windows,
text: just two cipher doors at both ends of a cramped shoe box
text: room. The muzak on a stereo drowns out the tele-types.
text: Battered but clean, Nate sits at his desk staring at "The
text: Bubble": a hermetically sealed office floating on an air-
text: cushioned platform. Above its door is an illuminated red
text: light bulb and an idle green bulb.
dialog: 19.
text: The DEPUTY CHIEF OF STATION is eyefucking Nate from the next
dialog: chair.
scene_heading: DEPUTY CHIEF OF STATION
dialog: You think you're so fucking special,
dialog: with your goof attitude, goof clothes ---
text: neverending diplomatic pussy hunts.
dialog: But I always knew something like
dialog: this was gonna happen.
text: The light turns red to green. As Nate gets up, The Deputy
text: Chief cuts him a hateful smile.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Yeah, well, Harry, no matter what
dialog: happens in life, there's always some
dialog: asswipe who knew it would.
text: A few Case Officers chuckle. Nate code opens the Bubble door ---
scene_heading: INT. COS OFFICE/"THE BUBBLE" - CIA STATION - MINUTES LATER
text: Staring across his desk at Nate is GORDON GONDORFF, CHIEF OF
text: MOSCOW STATION, mid-forties, beleaguered.
speaker_heading: GONDORFF
text: The D.O. has been screaming over the
text: wire, Benford is apoplectic.
dialog: Ambassador's getting reamed with
dialog: calls from the Kremlin --- they want
dialog: to declare you persona-non-grata.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: They can't PNG me. It's against the

dialog: was out of pocket, they've got shit.
speaker_heading: GONDORFF
dialog: The Militia whose jaw you broke ID'd
dialog: you from the Dip list ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: It's his word against mine ---
speaker_heading: GONDORFF
dialog: Even if I could stop them from booting
dialog: you, how can I put you back on the
dialog: street? You'll have half the goons
dialog: from the 2nd and 7th Directorates up
dialog: your ass. Too hot to operate,

speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll spend the next 6 months driving

speaker_heading: GONDORFF
dialog: Look, Nash --- you don't need to
dialog: worry. Your hall file isn't going to
dialog: take a hit for this ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (explodes with rage)
dialog: My hall file!? You think I give a
dialog: shit about that? I have only one
dialog: concern here. You understand? One.
text: Gondorff's nose starts trickling blood. Nate gestures --
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: You got a nose bleed again.
speaker_heading: GONDORFF
text: Fucking hermetically-sealed air.
text: Gondorff pulls a few tissues, stuffs them in his nostril. He
text: futzes with his nose throughout the rest of the scene.
speaker_heading: GONDORFF (CONT'D)
dialog: I appreciate that you care about
text: Marble, but Benford doesn't. He's
text: uneasy with the emotional bond.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: The emotional bond is why I swam
dialog: through a river of shit -- risked my
dialog: life to get back here with the take.
dialog: It's why Marble's production has
dialog: tripled since I've had him in the
dialog: harness. I'm doing good work here,
dialog: Gordon.
speaker_heading: GONDORFF
dialog: Look, this incident aside, all of
dialog: our activity with Marble was going
dialog: to have to be put on ice for the
dialog: next 6 months to a year anyway ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: (off Gondorff's resistance)
dialog: C'mon, Gordon, what's going on?
speaker_heading: GONDORFF

dialog: Marble's people are gonna know they
dialog: have a problem.
text: This sends Nate spinning.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: But they already know what's at
dialog: Vorkuta. Marble told them!
speaker_heading: GONDORFF
dialog: Company's in the shitter right now.
dialog: Congress has our balls in a vice,
dialog: the White House has a knife to our
dialog: throat --- and Bush is a cunt. Wants
dialog: to put some easy points on the board
dialog: by giving the president an ace in
dialog: the hole for the SALT talks ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't
dialog: you let me warn him?
speaker_heading: GONDORFF
dialog: I was given direct orders by Benford.
dialog: He didn't want to risk Marble holding
dialog: back on this latest take.
text: Overwhelmed with rage and disgust, Nate pops out of his chair.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: He's gonna think I knew. He's gonna
dialog: think I fucked him.
speaker_heading: GONDORFF
dialog: That's just it, Nate, this isn't
dialog: about you. The sooner you come to
dialog: terms with that, the less painful
dialog: this job's going to be.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: The average survival rate for our

dialog: Marble's been out in the wilderness

scene_heading: EXT. LAKE - DACHA - COUNTRYSIDE OUTSIDE OF MOSCOW - DAY
text: A large Dacha (country house) overlooks a rollicking

text: Amid the older heavies is the new wave: KGB LIEUTENANT COLONEL
text: IVANOVICH EGOROV, 36, unconventionally attractive, modish
text: groove, cool confidence. He plays GO and observes the action
text: while holding court at a table of young KGB and GRU sharks.
text: A military vehicle pulls up to the party. Egorov observes
text: TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS get out and hurry to the most powerful
text: person at the party, DEFENSE MINISTER SERGI GRENCHENKO. Taking
text: Grenchenko aside, the Officers give him displeasing news.
text: ANGLE ON KORCH: seated on the grass, eyes shut, basking in
text: the sun. VERA, early-50s, radiantly cute, sits next to him.
text: Korch looks over and sees her smiling at him and smiles back,
text: delighted to see her. He tenderly kisses her hands.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Vera --- it's so good to see you.
dialog: How are you? The children?
speaker_heading: VERA (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I'm much better -- Larisa is still
dialog: teaching in St. Petersburg and
dialog: Svetlana's six months pregnant ---
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Wonderful!
speaker_heading: VERA (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I just wanted to thank you. The
dialog: letters you sent after Pavel died
dialog: meant so much. Knowing you'd come
dialog: through the loss of Anya. (Beat) You
dialog: helped me get through the worst of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I'm glad.
text: Charmingly awkward tension, like teenagers. Interrupted by A
text: ROAR OF JABBERING, they turn toward a DEBAUCHED RETIRING
text: GENERAL dancing and crying with a comrade. Vera chuckles...
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't laugh. A few more years and I
dialog: suspect that will be me ---
speaker_heading: VERA (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: And then what?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I don't know. It's hard to imagine
text: life outside the Aquarium.
speaker_heading: VERA (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: (sweet smile)
dialog: Well perhaps I can help you ---
text: Seeing that Korch is clueless, Vera takes a brave breath,
text: puts her hand on his and locks eyes with him.
speaker_heading: VERA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come over for dinner...
text: His surprise flits to delight -- which melts away when he's
text: struck with the impossibility of it all. Reading his
text: resignation as rejection, Vera fights back her vulnerability.
text: Korch is about to apologize when a uniformed Soldier appears.
text: Gazing across the party at Egorov as he watches Korch and
text: other powerful men heading inside, sensing something's up.
text: His suspicion is confirmed when a soldier approaches him.
scene_heading: INT. DEN - DACHA - BEAT LATER
text: Egorov steps into a cozy den and finds Korch; GENERAL ANDRE
text: SOKOLOV, FIRST DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE GRU; two senior-level KGB
text: DEPUTIES for counterintelligence and operations, and A DEPUTY
scene_heading: FOREIGN MINISTER.
text: Egorov's KGB seniors are irritated by his presence. Unruffled
text: by their vicious glares, he nods at them respectfully.
text: Grenchenko, The Defense Minister, rumbles in, sits at a table
text: with six chairs --- everyone but Egorov joins him. In the
text: center of the table, a basket of freshly-picked mushrooms.
speaker_heading: GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I've just received word that the
dialog: Americans have positioned a KEYHOLE
dialog: over the Vorkuta research complex ---
dialog: Easy to see that all but the Dep. Foreign Minister understands
dialog: the ominous gravity of this revelation.
scene_heading: DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: If I may ask, what kind of research?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Multiple independently targetable
text: reentry vehicles for heavy missiles.
scene_heading: DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: MIRVs are a direct violation of the
dialog: SALT treaty. If the Americans use
dialog: this, it will undermine our position
dialog: for the SALT II talks -- embarrass
dialog: Chairman Brezhnev --
speaker_heading: GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: (cuts him off)
dialog: Yes yes, I'm not interested in
dialog: discussing the consequences right
dialog: now, only the cause --- of which
dialog: there can only be one.
text: Picking a mushroom from the basket, Grenchenko pulls out a
text: pocket knife and slices it into pieces.
speaker_heading: GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: We've been compromised. And
dialog: determinations must be made before I
dialog: can brief the committee ---
dialog: (eats piece of mushroom)
dialog: Is this a technical breach? Have our
dialog: communications been penetrated? Or ---
dialog: do we have a mole?
text: The table contemplates. No one wants speak first. Korch,
text: especially uptight, throws an acid glare at the KGB guys.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: How many years have I been warning
dialog: you about this? How many reports
dialog: have I submitted about just such a
dialog: breach?
scene_heading: KGB DEPUTY COUNTERINTEL (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Yes, Vladimir Korchnoi, but we found
dialog: no conclusive evidence to support
dialog: your concerns.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: And now, comrade, is an American
dialog: satellite conclusive enough for you?
scene_heading: KGB DEPUTY OPERATIONS (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Vorkuta is a military program, over
dialog: which you asserted complete primacy.
speaker_heading: GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Enough. If anyone else points a
dialog: finger, I'll cut if off. I want a
dialog: determination.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Vorkuta is one of our most secure

scene_heading: KGB DEPUTY COUNTERINTEL (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: We are inclined to agree with this

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)

text: Everyone turns to Egorov. KGB guys furious that he spoke.
speaker_heading: GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Is there a connection?
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: So what of it?
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I don't believe he would've gone to

scene_heading: KGB DEPUTY COUNTERINTEL (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Have you read our assessment of Nash?
text: The man is a sex fiend, a marginal

text: Tati directs Dom to the photo drying on a line: a Diane Arbus-

speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)

text: Egorov nods in agreement and takes a seat next to Dom.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: We have a penetration of the top-

speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: You're not Counter Intelligence.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: This would be a special project,

speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: So they aren't pursuing him?
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
text: They are focusing their attention on

dialog: I'd like you to go there and make an

dialog: vulnerabilities, leverage. Can he be
dialog: approached? Manipulated? Is he still
dialog: operational with his Moscow asset?
dialog: (hard look)
dialog: Get under his skin.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I'm an operations officer ---
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)

text: Nate comes over, grins down at MARTY GABLE, the CIA's Deputy
dialog: Chief of Station for Athens. In his late 40's, Gable's a

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Jesus, Gable. Thought you would've

speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: And become a fucking cake eater?
dialog: Never.
text: Nate helps him up and they bear hug it out. Gable leads Nate

speaker_heading: FORSYTH

dialog: had a rough ride out of Moscow.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: FORSYTH

speaker_heading: GABLE

speaker_heading: GABLE

speaker_heading: FORSYTH
dialog: First time in the history of the

speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: (sneezes )
dialog: No love lost --- I hated Welch's
dialog: guts. Best thing you can say about
dialog: the prick was that he was cheap ---
dialog: but that's besides the point.
speaker_heading: FORSYTH
dialog: This is a street thing. Nobody greases
dialog: one of our people, let alone a chief,
dialog: and gets away with it ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I heard it was carried out by a

speaker_heading: GABLE

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Students did the hit? Kids?

speaker_heading: FORSYTH

speaker_heading: GABLE

text: Fuckers rob banks and move heroin to

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: So why haven't you rolled them up?
speaker_heading: FORSYTH
dialog: We've tried, but Moscow's got deep
dialog: hooks into Greek intelligence. And
dialog: it's been impossible to develop our

speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: Every one of our guys who's tried to

dialog: (grins at Nate)
dialog: But you, you don't look or stink
text: like a spook. Maybe they don't see
dialog: you coming.
speaker_heading: FORSYTH
dialog: We want you to stay away from the
dialog: station, the embassy, DIP circuit ---
dialog: Anyplace that any of us hang out at
dialog: is out of bounds for you.
speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: All we want you to do is work these
dialog: kids, develop us some assets.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I'm not a NOC.
speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: We're not asking you to be. You won't
dialog: be on the DIP list, but we fixed it

speaker_heading: FORSYTH
dialog: Marty'll brief you on the rest of

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - KORINTHIOS HARBOR - MINUTES LATER

speaker_heading: GABLE

speaker_heading: NATE

speaker_heading: GABLE

text: (off Nate's nod, thunders)
dialog: Well if you're looking for sympathy,

dialog: shit and syphilis! Anyone who's worth

dialog: at one time or another. It's how you

dialog: your head outta your ass and back
dialog: into the game and ring the fucking

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Wow, that was some pep talk...
text: Reaching his car, Gable takes out his keys, unlocks trunk.
speaker_heading: GABLE

speaker_heading: GABLE

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What's he going off about?
speaker_heading: LUKA
text: There is a big march on the American
dialog: Embassy in a few weeks --- We want

text: A pack of 6 ANARCHIST THUGS, more hardcore than everyone

speaker_heading: LUKA (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. NATE'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: BEDROOM: Dom looks through Nate's backpack. Nothing worthwhile.
text: About to return it, she feels the thickness of the shoulder
text: straps, inspects them. Finds a hidden seam, carefully opens

text: diplomatic passport. In the other strap, another wad of cash
text: and a mugshot, of Luka's cousin, CHRISTOS.
text: BEDSTAND AREA: A European Playboy on top of a stack of books.
text: She photographs each before flipping through them,

speaker_heading: THYIA

speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: And who can blame us? Greece is the
dialog: birthplace of democracy --- and what
dialog: does your government do? They

dialog: 50.
text: She swings open the door -- and knocks the ball bearing into
text: motion. Dom hears it ROLLING. Seeing the tiny ball, she seizes
text: with the dreaded realization that she just hit a second trip.
text: Closing the door, she picks up the ball, tries to figure out
text: where it was placed, but there's no way to know. She's fucked.
text: Suddenly struck by an idea -- Dom moves to the kitchen area
text: and kneels under the sink...
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING ROOF - EXARCHEIA - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: What took you --- !?
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: There was a ball bearing ---

speaker_heading: DOM (CONT'D)
text: He set a second trip on the inside
dialog: of the door -- I didn't see it ---
scene_heading: INT. NATE'S BUILDING/APARTMENT - MINUTE LATER
text: Nate and Luka walk to his flat. Noticing the hair is gone,
text: Nate subtly tenses up. He puts his key into the lock, realizes
text: the door's already open... The men share a look as they enter.
text: In the alcove they see water on the floor -- hear GRUNTS and
text: tools scraping. Stepping into the flat they find more water
text: and the Super under the sink trying to clamp a leaking pipe.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What the hell is this? What happened?
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION POST - APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Dom holds the mic like a gun, aiming the scope through the

text: to her with the headphones so they can both listen...
speaker_heading: SUPER (OVER HEADPHONES)
text: Pipes leak again! Water comes through
dialog: my ceiling --- now please, help ---
dialog: hold this tight so I can stop ---
text: Elena takes a breath of relief. Dom lowers the mic, sets the

text: Dom's still coiled with acute tension, furious with herself...
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Quick thinking ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: I was lucky ---
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Luck is the residue of skill,

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: You are being too hard on yourself ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: If I'm not, they will be.
text: Elena is struck by the intensity of Dom's self-rage and fear.

text: stack of Polaroids --- lays out a photo of Christos's mugshot.
speaker_heading: DOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Does he look familiar?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: His name is Christos Kostas. He has

speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I'm a blind man in a dark room looking

speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Any way I can help?
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Not with this, but there is something ---
dialog: you've heard of the walk-in in
dialog: Istanbul?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: The German engineer. I hear the taste
dialog: of intel he gave us is impressive.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
text: Beyond impressive. Unprecedented.
dialog: But his list of demands before he
dialog: discloses anything else is
text: preposterous. They get greedier and

speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Better than a shit-eater volunteering

text: Sokolov manages a derisive smile.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - KGB ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING - MINUTES LATER
text: Carrying a large pastry box in hand, Egorov heads down a

scene_heading: INT. EGOROV'S COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS
text: The mole hunt command center is a large, open room cluttered
text: with desks, file cabinets, and cots. The walls are covered

text: Egorov's 2nd in command, LIEUTENANT BORIS KOSOLOV directs a

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: So --- Nicoleyevsky?
speaker_heading: KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: But he held so much promise. Motive,
dialog: access, the hubris.
speaker_heading: KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: But not the opportunity. We finished
text: reconciling his movements with the
dialog: timeline --- too many discrepancies.
dialog: It's not him. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Don't be. Elimination is still

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Early this morning...

text: Two columns over is KORCHNOI's photo and profile.
scene_heading: INT. EGOROV'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: A small, spartan space. Egorov moves to a hulking

text: a key from around his neck, inserts it and turns. Types ina

text: Ripping it off the printer Egorov sits at his immaculate

text: waves the waiting Kosolov into his office.
speaker_heading: KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Word from Athens?
text: Egorov slides him the Telex printout. Kosolov reads it.
speaker_heading: KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
dialog: The collected poems of Pavel Markova.
dialog: And in Russian no less. Interesting.
dialog: (off Egorov's look)
dialog: His volumes are impossible to find
dialog: in Moscow. Most were purged.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: That's hardly the meat of it ---
dialog: (snatches telex back)
dialog: But the fact that Nash is focusing
dialog: on these useful idiots, November 17,
dialog: could be advantageous.
speaker_heading: KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: If she is unable to get what we need
dialog: her way, this gives us the cover for
dialog: another option.
text: Surprised, Kosolov throws him a grave look, are you serious?
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
dialog: A deadly disease sometimes requires

speaker_heading: KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)

scene_heading: reads: TAKIS GALLERY - KASTIMBALIS - FIXED METAMORPHICS.
text: Some PEOPLE are hanging outside while others flow in and out
text: of the front gates. A friendly, laid-back vibe. The exotic,

scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD - TAKIS GALLERY - ATHENS - CONTINUOUS
text: A ruinous courtyard packed with the Athens's Bohemian jet

text: Moving closer, Dom peruses the sculptures while stealing

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - TAKIS GALLERY/OLD MANSION - MINUTE LATER
text: A dim, dead-end corridor, Nate rolls up behind a flirting
text: COUPLE waiting by a closed door. Finally a man comes out and
text: the couple goes in. Nate's annoyed, really needs to piss.
text: Dom suddenly appears, getting in line behind Nate. Although
text: he tries to play it cool, he's clearly struck by her beauty
text: and vibe. He gives her an easy "what's up" nod. She nods
dialog: back.
text: After a beat, something catches Nate's eye -- a small, barely
text: noticeable sentence, hand-scrawled in Greek along the wall
text: in front of them. Nate breaks out in a luminous smile --
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: That's fucking inspired ---
dialog: (gestures to graffiti)
dialog: You see this?
speaker_heading: DOM (FRENCH ACCENT)
dialog: What does it say?

speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Christ, you gotta be kidding me...

speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: They gotta have another restroom
dialog: upstairs -- right?
text: UPSTAIRS - MINUTE LATER: Dom and Nate search the darkness of

speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm Nate --
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Dominique --
text: They finally locate a pitch-dark bathroom with a door that

text: switch is broken and won't stay on unless held.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I'll hold it for you, you for me. K?

scene_heading: DOM AND NATE COMING DOWN STAIRS - MINUTES LATER: Nate squares

speaker_heading: DOM (FRENCH ACCENT)
dialog: Amused?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: And you're not?
text: Nate's smirk opens up into a charmingly goofy but direct

speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Be patient -- eventually I'1l do or
dialog: say something interesting ---
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: (after a beat of waiting)

text: flowing with a hypnotic, unbridled expressiveness and power
text: that electrifies everyone around her, especially Nate.
text: LITTLE LATER: Blown out, Nate and Luka emerge from the dancing
text: mass, climb high up on the tiered benches and look down at

speaker_heading: LUKA (CONT'D)

dialog: She told Zoe she lives in Geneva ---

dialog: a friend's flat ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Yeah, I caught that...
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: We'll see.
text: Luka sparks a joint, tokes, and passes to Nate, who takes a
text: hit and looks around, taking everything in --- and catches
text: something in the crowd.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, isn't that one of the fucksticks
dialog: I scrapped it up with at the rally,
dialog: that was rolling with your cousin?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (gestures)
dialog: Right there. You see him? With the
text: white shirt.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: No, you need to get your eyes checked.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: Those guys would never come to a
dialog: party like this.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You ever gonna tell me what the deal
dialog: with them is? Is this guy Christos a
dialog: distant cousin?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: No, he's my dad's brother's son. We
dialog: were raised together after The
dialog: Colonels killed my uncle in prison.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: So he's more like a brother?
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: He used to be. He's just really angry
dialog: now. Even though I understand why, I
dialog: don't like being around it.

speaker_heading: ALEXA

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What's Tryphosa?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: A paradise for artists, dreamers ---
dialog: trust me, you will love it...
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I'm sold.
text: Nate tries to wave down an approaching taxi but to no avail.
text: The group walks ahead, giving Nate and Dom space. They lag
text: behind, quiet, side by side --- a palpable, unusual attraction
text: between them. After a long beat ---
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Watching you let loose was really
dialog: something else --- like you were in
dialog: an ecstatic trance -- I saw flashes
dialog: of Duncan -- Mary Wigman -- Graham...
text: Dom glares at Nate, trying to restrain her astonishment...
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: So you follow dance?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I follow the dancers.
text: They exchange a smile as another taxi appears --- Nate waves
text: and it stops.
text: The girls smother Dom with hugs and kisses, saying how much
text: fun they had, they need to hang out. Nate sees them exchange
text: phone numbers. Then the group gives Dom and Nate some space.
dialog: 62.
text: A crazy tension --- Dom off-balance, genuinely vulnerable --
text: Nate's easy -- he opens the Taxi door for her.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: This was fun ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: See what happens when you trust the
dialog: timing of your life?
dialog: (potent stare)
dialog: You're pretty fucking great --- keep
dialog: that shit up.
text: Nate breaks the tension by gently easing Dom into the taxi
dialog: and closing the door ---
text: Watching the taxi head down the street and disappear around
text: a corner, Nate smiles inwardly as he heads back to the others.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - STREETS OF ATHENS - BEAT LATER
text: Dom's rattled with conflicting emotion, struggling to get
text: control of herself. She looks at her trembling hands, unnerved
dialog: by her reaction, thinking, "what's wrong with me?"
speaker_heading: GABLE (V.O.)
dialog: What the fuck is wrong with you?
scene_heading: EXT./INT. GABLE'S CAR - OUTSKIRTS OF ATHENS - DAY
text: Gable's car parked on a nondescript street. Nate sits next
text: to Gable, who's chain-smoking.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Nothing. I'm just saying --- Luka is
dialog: a good kid, Marty. Clean. No
dialog: involvement with his cousin or N17
dialog: whatsoever.
speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: I want Christos --- everything else
dialog: is pickles and tits. So get with the
dialog: program, unless you wanna be sent
dialog: back to shitsville U.S.A., a fucking
dialog: floorwalker.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: If you just give me some more time,
dialog: I'll figure out another way to get
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: No, I'm not gonna risking it -- you
dialog: have the perfect setup. You go away
dialog: to this hippie island.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: GABLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have a great time. Fuck, suck, play.
dialog: Prime him. When you get back, you
dialog: put him in the harness and we start
text: to drill down on his cunt cousin.
text: Gable reaches into a secret compartment under his seat and
text: pulls out a small, cellophane-wrapped brick of heroin.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: The fuck is that?
speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: The fuck do you think? Blue Orchid,
text: same kind of junk N17 is moving.
dialog: Before you leave for your trip, you
dialog: stash this in the kid's apartment.
text: Nate takes the drugs. Gable writes a number on a piece of
text: paper, hands it to Nate.
speaker_heading: GABLE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the number for Captain Harry
dialog: Haridopolos, our guy in the Athens
dialog: PD. Call him, tell him you're a friend
dialog: of Mister Fenwick. He'll understand.
dialog: Set up the bust for when you get
dialog: back.
text: Nate shakes his head over how fucked up it is.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: It's not right putting him into play --
dialog: it's gonna ruin his life.
speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: Kid's going in the system, Nate. You
dialog: either run him, or someone else will.
speaker_heading: NATE

text: Exhausted, Dom gets up, checks camera, then her watch. Sitting
text: at the table, she drinks some water.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I envy your flexibility. How long

speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Ever since I can remember.
speaker_heading: ELENA

speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Life.
text: Elena stops knitting, keels forward a bit.
speaker_heading: DOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you allright?
text: Elena takes Dom's hand and puts it on her stomach to feel

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: We are the only ones who can truly
dialog: feel the future, because we give
dialog: birth to it, yes?
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Where's the father?
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Beirut, last I heard.
dialog: (wistful smile)
dialog: Hard to resist a bad boy that's a
dialog: good man. (Beat) I assumed that were
dialog: a sparrow --- but you're an operations
dialog: officer, aren't you?
text: Dom removes her hand from Elena's tummy and after a hesitant
text: beat, nods. Elena smiles, stunned and impressed.
speaker_heading: ELENA (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, I wasn't pressed into
dialog: service. I do it because I have faith
dialog: in the Marxist ideal. I've always
dialog: believed in the cause despite feeling
dialog: that the cause never truly believed
dialog: in me ---
dialog: (proud look at Dom)
dialog: Until this moment, I never thought
dialog: they would see us as something more
dialog: than just a wife, secretary or whore ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: They don't, not really ---
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: What does the Center want from Nash?

speaker_heading: DOM

speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: Where are Zoe and Thyia?
speaker_heading: ALEXA
dialog: They are not coming. Zoe's got a

speaker_heading: NATE

scene_heading: EXT./INT. FERRY - FOREDECK PASSENGER LOUNGE - LATER

text: trying to get someone's attention. Nate turns around and
text: sees Dom in the crowd. He's stunned, caught totally off guard.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Holy shit...

speaker_heading: LUKA

speaker_heading: DOM

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Hey.

speaker_heading: DOM

text: Korch rumbles in and everyone stands at attention, salutes.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: DIPLOMATIC COURIER (IN RUSSIAN)

scene_heading: INT. KORCH'S OFFICE - GRU HO - MOMENTS LATER
text: Seated at his desk, Korch dials the combos to the case's two

text: He opens it, pulls out a typed report and photos -- all of
text: which are stamped on the back with a unique code.
text: Korch reads the report, then peruses the pictures -- he stops
text: on one photo, grabs a magnifying glass, and inspects the
text: image -- his interest suddenly shifts to concern.
text: Korch quickly moves to his safe -- unlocks it, grabs Egorov's
text: dossier -- slaps on his desk, rifles through it until he

scene_heading: EXT. COASTLINE - SEA OF CRETE - DAY

text: half-asleep. Dom sits nearby, looking over at ---
text: Nate kicking it with STAVROS, 60s, a village fisherman-turned-
text: hippie, whistling as he steers. Nate joins the whistling.
text: They round a bend. A mile ahead, a COLOSSAL WHITE PUMICE
text: ROCK FORMATION juts out of the coast, the size of a six story
text: building, blocking the land behind it. Stavros nods to it.
speaker_heading: STAVROS
dialog: Tryphosa.
text: Luka and Alexa wake. They all move to the bow, gaze at the
text: rock. Dom squints, shading her eyes from the sun, so Nate
text: puts his bucket hat on her. She thanks him with a look.
dialog: 68.
text: They spot the silhouettes of PEOPLE on top of the rock
text: standing up, waving at them.
text: As they finally come around the rock, Tryphosa is revealed:
text: A natural, horseshoe-shaped harbor framing a perfect beach.
text: Abutting one end of the beach, the massive rock face is
text: honeycombed by a matrix caves converted into into hippie
text: dwellings, squatters emerging from them like a motel.
text: Behind the beach is a tiny village of flagstone streets and
text: white-washed, minimal houses nestled along the slopes.
text: Bordering the other side of the beach is another, taller
text: white rock formation. On top of it are TEMPLE RUINS. At the
text: base of this formation is a natural quay and a plane of smooth
text: rock jutting into the water, with SUNBATHERS laying on it.
text: MAMA'S TAVERNA edges the beach. Painted across the taverna's
text: wall in massive, hippie flower children font is the phrase:
text: “TODAY IS LIFE, TOMORROW NEVER COMES."
text: The group is awestruck. Luka grabs the girls' hands on either
text: side of him and Alexa grabs Nate's.
scene_heading: EXT. TRYPHOSA VILLAGE - ISLAND - LATER
dialog: 
text: Hauling their gear, the group follows MAMA, 50s, the big

speaker_heading: MAMA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, and there is only 1 telephone in
dialog: the Taverna in case of emergency...
text: They approach the teal blue door of one of the white PRIMITIVE

scene_heading: INT. PRIMITIVE VILLA - TRYPHOSA - ISLAND - BEAT LATER
dialog: 
text: Mama leads them into the primitive villa's main room: A table,

text: water basin, a wood-burning stove. There are 2 bedrooms --
text: and a veranda with a hammock strung up -- a stunning view.
speaker_heading: MAMA (IN GREEK)
text: The communal dinners are down on the
dialog: beach at 9 --- all that we ask is
dialog: that you bring an offering.
dialog: 69.
text: And with that Mama leaves. The group walks out onto the
text: veranda and takes in the view. Dom gazes at the caves, struck
dialog: by the magic of this place.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: The Romans used those caves as
dialog: catacombs ---
text: Nate gestures to the ruins atop the other rock formation.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: And those ruins?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: I don't know ---
text: They all exchange a smile.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNBATHER ROCKS - TRYPHOSA - LATER
text: Throngs of Hippies hanging out on the otherworldly rocks
text: tabled high over the water. Dom and Alexa lay topless on
text: towels, eyes closed. Alice Coltrane's "Blue Nile" wafting
text: from Dom's tape deck.
text: Nate and Luka are playing backgammon next to them. Nate is
dialog: having trouble focusing on the game -- struggling to not
text: check Dom out. Nate can see Luka is very amused by all this.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: If it scares you, it might be a good
dialog: thing to try.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Asshole...
speaker_heading: LUKA

scene_heading: INT. KORCHNOI'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Korch's modest one-bedroom apartment. A shelf with a record
text: player and stacks of records. A console table lined with
text: PHOTOS OF KORCH -- his childhood; one with his father; most
text: with his gorgeous wife, a shrine to their love.
text: Korch is sitting at his kitchen table with a transistor radio
text: that's been cracked open revealing an empty hiding spot.
dialog: 70.
text: He's hunched over the "BUSTER" covcomm device Nate gave him
text: earlier -- fingers typing a message on the minuscule keyboard.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CENTRAL MOSCOW - LATER
dialog: 
text: Dressed for an afternoon in the park, Korch gets on a bus
text: with a small chess set in hand, a bag of fruit and the
text: transistor radio. Though he has sunglasses on, he's clearly
text: in hyper-aware SDR mode, clocking everything around him.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - MOSCOW - LATER
text: Korch sits down at a table in an area where chess matches
text: are being played. He sets up his pieces, puts his radio next
text: to the board and extends the antenna ---
text: He presses down hard on the ON switch, sending the burst
text: transmission, then switches the radio on --- he futzes with
text: it while looking at a green indicator --- after a few seconds
text: the light goes on. Korch relaxes a little bit as a MAN
text: approaches to challenge him to a game.
text: THE CAMERA RISES ABOVE THE CANOPY OF THE PARK revealing the
text: American Embassy is a few blocks away.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - TRYPHOSA - NIGHT
text: The communal dinner. 35 people sitting around a table of
text: offerings and jugs of wine, talking, laughing, eating.
text: While chatting with a CHUBBY GUY, Nate catches Dom stealing
text: a glance at him amidst her own conversation. They lock eyes,
text: Nate flashes a little grin, she smiles back.
text: An amused Luka nudges Nate to turn around -- they watch two
text: YOUNG HIPPIES performing a ritual while lighting the bonfire.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Oh shit. I just thought of something.
dialog: I think I forgot to turn the hot
dialog: plate off in my place. Antony, the
dialog: super, do you know his number?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Could you call Thyia or Zoe and see
dialog: if one of them could go over and
dialog: turn it off? I don't want to burn
text: the building down.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: Yeah, okay, I'll call tonight.

scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - TRYPHOSA - LATER
text: Bonfire's crackling. A couple of GUITARISTS strumming along.
text: Jugs of wine and joints making the rounds.
text: Dom's talking with an OLD HIPPIE as he gestures to the ruins
text: atop the colossal rock. Finally his GIRL pulls him away.
text: Dom looks around -- no sign of Luka or Alexa. She turns,
text: sees Nate walking down the beach along the waterline. Catching
text: up to him, they move together, not saying anything. Finally,
text: Dom gestures to the ruins.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: I found out what the ruins are ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: It's a dream temple, a sanctuary for
dialog: those seeking healing, a relief from
dialog: a pain of the soul. The ancient Greeks
dialog: called it an Asclepieion.
text: Nate stops and looks at her.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Come on, for real --- ?
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Yes. The temple's priests would heal
dialog: people using a dream therapy.
text: Dom heads up into the village. Nate following.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - VILLAGE OF TRYPHOSA - MINUTE LATER
text: Nate and Dom wind up towards their villa. Behind them are
text: the moonlit ruins atop the rock...
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: The ritual began with 2 days of
dialog: purifying sweat chambers and baths ---
dialog: after which the priests would massage
dialog: sacred oils into your body --
dialog: preparing you for your entry into
dialog: the dream incubation chamber ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (repeats it dreamily)
text: Dream incubation chamber... Far out.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Once in the chamber, you would be
text: lulled into a deep sleep by soft
dialog: chanting -- and it is in your dreams
dialog: that your soul would be cured of its
dialog: woes. The priests would interpret
dialog: your dream and extract its divine
dialog: prescription for how to live your
dialog: life -- and if you followed it, you
dialog: would be made whole again.
text: Dom and Nate reach their villa. Nate looks back at the ruins.
speaker_heading: NATE

speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: I'd like that.
text: Dom and Nate share a look.
scene_heading: INT. PRIMITIVE VILLA - TRYPHOSA - CONTINUOUS
text: Nate and Dom enter the dark, empty villa. Nate lights a

speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Good night, Nate.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Yeah, okay...
text: Dom shuts herself in her room. Nate exhales like, "Fuuuck."
scene_heading: EXT. VERANDA - PRIMITIVE VILLA - TRYPHOSA - LATE NIGHT
text: Nate swinging in the hammock, mind racing, gazing into the

speaker_heading: NATE

text: when she hears Nate, Luka and Alexa talking outside --
speaker_heading: NATE (0.S.)
dialog: Funny.
speaker_heading: ALEXA (0.S.)
dialog: We're not joking. Zoe says they found

speaker_heading: NATE (0.S.)
dialog: Heroin?! Fucking heroin?
text: Dom steps closer to eavesdrop.
scene_heading: EXT. VERANDA - PRIMITIVE VILLA - TRYPHOSA - SAME TIME
text: Nate's out of the hammock now.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: I swear to you I have no idea what's
dialog: going on right now. I've never gone

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: So, what? You're saying the police
dialog: planted it in your apartment?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: No, Antony was with them the whole

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Jesus Christ, how the fuck did it
dialog: get there, Luka? Magic?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: I don't know, I don't know. It's not
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: It's okay, I believe you. We just

speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know anyone that you've been
dialog: with over the past few months that
dialog: is into this kind of shit, who
dialog: could've stashed it in your apartment
dialog: without you being aware? A friend?
dialog: Neighbor? Anyone?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: (stiffens up, nods)
dialog: But I can't believe he would ever do
dialog: this to me ---
speaker_heading: ALEXA
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: My cousin --- Christos.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: He's a fucking pusher?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: He's into a lot of things that I
dialog: don't want to know anything about.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: When was the last time he was in
dialog: your place?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: Three, four months ago.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Only way the police would be there
dialog: is if he ratted you out to them.
text: Luka starts breaking down.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: He'd never do that, he'd never do
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Luka, what other explanation is there?
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: What am I going to do?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Look brother, a situation like this,
dialog: you don't have many options. But I
dialog: think I can help.
text: Nate kneels to his pack, undoes the secret flap in the strap
text: and pulls out a wad of cash and offers it to Luka ---
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's 5 grand. Pack your stuff,
dialog: wake up Stavros on his boat and get
dialog: out of here, now ---
dialog: (puts cash in Luka's hand)
dialog: You gotta disappear for the next 6
dialog: months. Just get lost, lay low. Don't
dialog: go anywhere near Athens.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: That's insane. If Christos did this
dialog: to me, I'm going to confront him.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You can't go anywhere near your cousin
dialog: ever again. Not even a fucking phone
dialog: call. He'll bury you.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: Athens is my home, I've done nothing
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: The fuck does that have to do with
dialog: anything?
dialog: (off Luka's silence)
dialog: Luka, please, I'm trying to save

speaker_heading: ALEXA

speaker_heading: LUKA

dialog: We'll make an adventure out of it.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: What about Dom?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: She'll be fine. I'll figure it out.
speaker_heading: LUKA
dialog: How can I repay you?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Keep safe. Be happy. And stay away

speaker_heading: ALEXA
dialog: Will you be there when we get back?
speaker_heading: NATE

text: As Luka and Alexa disappear inside, we can see Dom is no
dialog: longer there.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - TRYPHOSA - MORNING
text: Nate sits on the sand staring at the water --- he looks fucked
text: up and far from home. Dom approaches, sits next to him.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Where is everyone?
speaker_heading: NATE
text: Gone. There was a phone call late
dialog: last night, Luka had a family
text: emergency. He and Alexa left.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Oh my God, that's terrible. Is
dialog: everything okay?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I don't know. I hope so.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I get how awkward this must be for
dialog: you. There's a boat leaving at noon,
dialog: you can take it.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: So what are you doing?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: It all depends.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Alexa and the girls think you are a
dialog: fugitive, that this is why you don't
dialog: talk about yourself or your past ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Well neither do you. What does that
dialog: make you? What are you hiding?
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Touche. But how am I supposed to be
dialog: comfortable around a man I know
dialog: nothing about?
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Forget about what you know. How do
dialog: you feel around me? Do you feel safe?
dialog: Do you feel good?
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Isn't that enough? Do we really need
dialog: to know each other to enjoy this
dialog: place together?
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: How is that supposed to work? We
dialog: don't talk?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: No, we just don't ask questions about
dialog: each other's lives.
dialog: (off her hesitancy)
dialog: C'mon, lay your armor down, just for
dialog: the weekend. You can put it back on
dialog: when we get back to Athens.
text: Dom considering. She looks past, sees the graffiti on Mama's ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Today is life, tomorrow never comes.
text: Nate glances back at it, turns to Dom, smiles.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Why not?
text: She meets his smile. It's a deal.
scene_heading: EXT. WATER - JUST OFF THE COAST OF TRYPHOSA - LATER
dialog: 
text: Just off the coast, incredible white rock formations jut out
text: of the water. Nate and Dom tool around on a boat with an

text: underneath a series of massive natural archways ---
text: Nate steers through a tiny opening between 2 formations into ----
scene_heading: EXT. NATURAL SWIMMING POOL / BEACH - CONTINUOUS
text: A huge natural swimming pool hidden by rock walls, a tiny
text: strip of beach at the end. Nate and Dom gaze around in wonder.
text: LATER: Nate and Dom laying back on a white blanket under a
text: rigged canopy, remnants of a picnic, water lapping the sand
text: a few feet away. Dom's wearing his hat, staring at him.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You ever gonna give me my hat back?
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: I like your hat.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I like my hat on you.

scene_heading: EXT. FARMERS MARKET - TRYPHOSA - LATER

scene_heading: EXT. VERANDA - PRIMITIVE VILLA - TRYPHOSA - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Dom watches from the veranda as Nate expertly chops tomatoes
text: and cooks squid over a propane flame inside. MUSIC and VOICES
text: from the beach emanate in the background.
text: Nate finishes assembling the plates. He walks them out to
text: the veranda and places them on the candle-lit table.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: This is beautiful, thank you.
text: Nate sees she's surprised and impressed by the dishes.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: My grandparents.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: That's who taught me about food, how
dialog: to cook. I was raised by them. My
dialog: grandfather was a produce wholesaler,
dialog: my grandmother was always in the
dialog: kitchen. It was through cooking that
dialog: she expressed her love ---
dialog: (cuts a little grin)
dialog: I was a fat fuckin' kid.
text: She giggles, uncharacteristically easy.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: It must have been wonderful to be
dialog: loved like that.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Yeah, sure. They did their best to
dialog: compensate for the fact that my mom...
dialog: And my father, well...
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: My father died when I was very young.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: DOM (CONT'D)
dialog: I only have the vaguest memory of
dialog: him. I lost my mother at 17, which
dialog: is when I had to stop dancing ---
dialog: (stops herself)
dialog: You know what, let's not do this.
dialog: Share our sad stories ---
text: Nate nods in agreement --- waits for her to take a bite, and
text: enjoys watching her savor the food.
text: LATER: Dom finishes clearing the last plate. Tension smoldering
text: inside her. She turns around, Nate is in the doorway, staring
text: at her. Both feeling something visceral, both nervous about
text: it. To cut the tension, Nate smirks ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Fuck me if I'm wrong, but dinosaurs
dialog: still exist, right?
text: She takes a step towards him, vulnerable --- whispers ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Stop it.
text: He steps close enough to kiss her -- hovering -- until neither
text: can take it -- they kiss. Quickly turning hungry, consuming.
dialog: Dom comes alive in ways we only saw when she was dancing.
text: He lifts her, her legs straddling around him. She yanks his
text: shirt off as he carries her into the BEDROOM, lays her on
text: the bed. Dropping his pants, he TEARS her dress off.
text: As he feasts on Dom --- her lips, her neck, her breasts ---
text: his hand slides between her legs and begins to get her off.
text: Her body contorts as the ecstatic pressure builds, until
text: she's gasping, quaking, losing her mind in a cataclysmic
dialog: orgasm -- perhaps her first ever with another man.
text: Fueled by her pleasure, he positions himself between her
text: legs, but looking down at her he stops --
text: Her gasps have given way to restrained, barely-audible sobs,
text: tears streaking a face so fragile it may shatter. He looks
text: at her like a wounded little girl and she closes up, trembling ---
text: She weeps uncontrollably as she starts pulling away, but
text: Nate won't let her. Intuitively understanding, he cradles
text: her, whispering into her ear, though we can't hear his words.
text: We HEAR Music, Eric Satie's "Gnossienne's No. 1" --- and
text: strange sounds: electronic hiss, audio distortion --- heavy
text: breathing, grunts --- carrying us into...
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: INT. EGOROV'S APARTMENT - MOSCOW - NIGHT
text: Bathed in the flickering light of a TV, Egorov sits on his

text: Sipping vodka. Satie record playing on console behind him.
text: Distorted voices emanate from the TV, a BRITISH MAN and a
dialog: WOMAN speaking French-accented English --
speaker_heading: WOMAN (0.S., VIDEO)
dialog: You're nothing --- say it.
text: ARCING AROUND THE EDGE OF THE ROOM --- slowly revealing the
text: TV SCREEN, hooked up to a primitive VCR ---
text: After a few pained, ecstatic GRUNTS, the man replies ---
speaker_heading: BRITISH MAN (0.S., VIDEO)
dialog: I'm nothing.
text: We can finally make out the video -- dark, grainy surveillance
text: footage -- a bedroom -- the man on all fours while the woman
text: kneels behind him, pegging him in the ass with a strap-on --
speaker_heading: WOMAN (VIDEO)
dialog: And what am I?
text: After a few rugged thrusts, we catch a quick glimpse of the
text: woman as she glances towards the camera -- it's Dom --
speaker_heading: BRITISH MAN (VIDEO)
dialog: Everything.
text: A sudden KNOCK on Egorov's door. Surprised, he gets up, shuts
text: off the tv and music. He opens his front door, revealing his
text: right-hand man Kosolov --- Egorov lets him in.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: We found something --- something

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You don't need to explain.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: I can't imagine what you must think.
text: Nate stops, turns to her.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I feel sorry for people who never go
dialog: crazy -- Screws fall out all the
dialog: time. We're all fucked up inside ---
dialog: that's what makes us us.
text: Dom looks at Nate with soul-stirred awe.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: You still must be disappointed ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Whaddya talkin' about? It was the
dialog: best sex I never had.
text: Dom throws her arms around him and kisses him passionately.
scene_heading: EXT. VOLCANIC HOT SPRINGS - TRYPHOSA - LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: Nate and Dom come down a rocky path to an ancient, domed
text: white-washed building with a blue door. To the left of the
text: building is a huge pond of bubbling volcanic mud and water.
text: Stripping to their bathing suits, she takes his hand as they
text: step into the mud. Squishing down, Dom smiles, tripped out.
text: Nate CHUCKS a chunk of mud at her. She screams, picks up a
text: handful and pegs him back. They exchange mud throws, screaming
text: and laughing, until they wrestle and collapse together.
text: They make out and spread mud over each other. Sensual.
text: Covering their entire bodies.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LATER: Nate and Dom lay out, mud caked onto them. He stands,
text: grabs a loofa from his bag, leads her into the domed building---
scene_heading: INT. ANCIENT BATH HOUSE - TRYPHOSA - CONTINUOUS
text: Shafts of steamy light cut through holes in the domed ceiling.
text: Thermal water flows from pipes into two rock bathtubs.
dialog: 82.
text: Nate climbs into the tub and offers his hand. She stares at
text: the tub, anxiety welling in her eyes... until she looks at
text: Nate, lets go of all of it, takes his hand and gets in...
dialog: and it's okay, she's okay.
text: Dom leans back into Nate as he gently scrubs the dried mud
text: off her. They switch, Dom starts scrubbing him ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: It's our last night.
text: Nate nods, clearly upset by that.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What do you want to do?
scene_heading: EXT. ASCLEPIEION - DREAM TEMPLE RUINS - TRYPHOSA - SUNSET
text: Nate and Dom are sitting inside the ruins of the DREAM TEMPLE,
text: blankets and pillows laid out, wine and food. They're looking
text: out as the sun disappears over the sea, an epic vista ina
text: mystical place, but the mood has turned somber ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Let's stay longer. Just a few more
dialog: days ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: I need to go back.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: I don't have the freedom you do.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: What, are you married? Is that it?
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: We had an agreement. No questions.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: So we just bury all of this, how
dialog: we're feeling right now ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: I don't know. It's complicated ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Shit!
text: Tense, Nate gets up, walks to the edge of the temple.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know -- a few months ago a friend
dialog: asked me what I truly want outta
dialog: life, who do I wanna be. (Beat) I
dialog: couldn't give any fuckin' answers,
dialog: not one.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Which makes you no different than
dialog: most of us...
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: But that's the thing. I always wanted
dialog: to be different --- I've just been
dialog: so caught up in the bullshit of being
dialog: me, I somehow lost who I am ---
dialog: (turns to Dom)
dialog: I know you know exactly what I'm
dialog: talking about ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: It doesn't matter ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Maybe it's all that matters.
dialog: (off her silence)
dialog: You're not sayin' anything, but you're
text: screamin' inside, and I can hear it.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Why are you making things more
dialog: difficult?
text: Nate sits down next to her, frustrated.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You're my favorite new feeling. I
dialog: just don't wanna lose it.
text: Dom spoons Nate, wraps her arms around him and whispers ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Let's sleep --- and perhaps in our

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - OFFICE BUILDING - MINUTE LATER

dialog: hours --
speaker_heading: GABLE

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You tell me. I woke up Sunday, Luka
dialog: and his girl had split for points
dialog: unknown, and then I found out your
dialog: guy on Athens PD jumped the gun,
dialog: tossed his place the night we left.
speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: Haridopolos said he was just followin’
dialog: the instructions you gave him.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: C'mon, and you believe that shit?
dialog: After all the work I put in, why
dialog: would I blow the bust like this?
speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: ‘Cause your heart wasn't in it. You
dialog: didn't want to put the kid in the

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: If I was gonna cut him loose, I
dialog: would've come up with something a
dialog: little smarter, Marty. My fingerprints
dialog: wouldn't be on it.
speaker_heading: FORSYTH
dialog: We don't have time to deal with it

speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)

text: And as if to answer, we hear a BELCH from in the bathroom --
text: a FLUSH -- someone quickly washing hands and then the door
text: opens -- in steps SY BENFORD, head of the CIA's SOVIET/EAST

speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is he dead --- ?
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: NATE

speaker_heading: BENFORD

speaker_heading: NATE

speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: I don't know --- I don't like it.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: There are no duress indicators in

speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: In all the years we've had Marble,
dialog: he's never done anything like this --
dialog: a last minute emergency face to face?
dialog: It's totally out of character.
dialog: Something's wrong.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Clearly something's wrong --- but
dialog: that doesn't mean the ask isn't legit.
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: He's setting the time, the location,
dialog: everything ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Of course he is. You assholes fucked
dialog: him over. Why should he trust you?
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: How do you know he didn't send this
text: with a Line KR gun to his head?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Because what I know is something a
dialog: craven motherfucker like you will
dialog: never understand ---
dialog: (gets into Benford's face)
dialog: If they had a gun to his head, he
dialog: woulda made them pull the trigger
dialog: before setting me up.

speaker_heading: BENFORD

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I can't remember the last time there

speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: I find it comforting --- as though

text: Elena looks at Dom, can see there is a lot on her mind.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: It's been 11 hours since you got

speaker_heading: DOM
text: He's probably still debriefing his

speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: Hard not to admire what he did ---
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: Does it make it harder for you,
dialog: knowing that he's a decent man?
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Just like our eyes, our hearts have
text: a way of adjusting to the darkness.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I hope for your sake that his act of
dialog: conscience doesn't cause his superiors
dialog: to send him back to America ---

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: With all due respect, I believe your
dialog: friendship with him is clouding your
dialog: judgment.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: And I believe your lust for power is
dialog: clouding yours. This is Vladimir
dialog: Korchnoi you insolent little prick ---
dialog: and you bring me this circumstantial
dialog: shit!? Unless you have overwhelming,
dialog: incontrovertible proof, I don't want
dialog: to ever hear you utter his name again.

dialog: 
text: Dom in front of the Cine Paris outdoor movie theater, scanning

dialog: 
text: A bright, full moon. A Grumman HU-16 Albatross Seaplane flying

text: back. Benford gazes out the window at the moon.
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: Goddamn full moon. Couldn't of picked
dialog: a worse night for this shmovert op ---
dialog: 92.
text: Benford reaches into a bag, pulls out a tiny, covert
text: microphone/wire device --- holds it out to Nate.
speaker_heading: BENFORD (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like you to wear this ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Yeah? Well, I'd like to titty bang

text: two voluptuous TURKISH HOOKERS, laughing, getting wasted ---
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Another drink ---
speaker_heading: VOLONTOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Yes!
text: Pretending to be drunk, Korch lumbers to a credenza, opens
text: another bottle of vodka. He surreptitiously takes out a tiny
text: vial of clear liquid -- as he pours four shots, he stealthily
text: mixes in doses from the vial into three of the glasses.
text: Korch pockets the vial just as Volontov staggers over, leans
text: in and gestures to the Hookers.
speaker_heading: VOLONTOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Does the General have a preference
dialog: for the evening?
text: Korch hands Volontov one of the spiked glasses and takes the
text: clean one for himself --- and raises it for a toast.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Maxim, you old wolfhound, I applaud
dialog: you on a beautiful operation!
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: The preference is entirely yours.
text: Beaming, Volontov clinks his glass and they gulp their shots.

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Alexei -- thank you for seeing me on
dialog: short notice.
speaker_heading: RUBANOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: It is quite alright, Ivan ---
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: (gestures to toddler)
dialog: And who is this little one?
speaker_heading: RUBANOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: My grandson, Viktor ---
text: Egorov smiles at the little boy... A beat...
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I hope you've been in good health
dialog: and spirits.
speaker_heading: RUBANOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Good enough. And you, your trajectory
dialog: at the Center continues it's rise?
dialog: Special projects for the Collegium ---
dialog: (off Egorov's nod)
dialog: You've positioned yourself well.
text: Rubanov rolls a toy to his Grandson. Smiles at him adoringly.
speaker_heading: RUBANOV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
dialog: So what brings you here?
speaker_heading: EGOROV
dialog: General Vladimir Korchnoi is traveling
dialog: at the moment. I wish to know his
dialog: exact whereabouts and the nature of
dialog: his activity.
speaker_heading: RUBANOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: This information is classified beyond
dialog: your realm.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Yes, but not yours. I'd like you to
dialog: find out for me --- right now.
text: Rubanov gawks at Egorov like he's nuts.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: RUBANOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Your perverse attempt at a joke?
text: Egorov answers with his eyes. Rubanov's baffled and incensed.
text: The toddler giggles and babbles as he plays with his toy.
text: Smiling, Egorov picks the boy up, begins to bounce him on
text: his knee -- speaking to him in a overly sweet tone.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Viktor, such a beautiful boy -- your
dialog: grandfather loves you dearly -- yes --
dialog: as he does all beautiful boys --
dialog: boys not much older than yourself.
dialog: When you become a man, what will you
dialog: think when you see the photos of
dialog: your grandfather viciously sodomizing
dialog: these children -- robbing them of
dialog: their youth, their dignity, their
dialog: lives? Will you still love him?
dialog: 
text: Rubanov's horrified as Egorov hands the boy over to him.
speaker_heading: RUBANOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I settled this account with your
dialog: father another lifetime ago. Those
dialog: photos, the negatives, he assured me
dialog: they were destroyed.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: He lied.
scene_heading: INT. SUITE - SARIYER HOTEL - ISTANBUL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Volontov and the two Hookers are unconscious on the couch.

scene_heading: INT. ROOF - SARIYER HOTEL - ISTANBUL - BEAT LATER

dialog: 
text: Nate in a commando dinghy, engine muffled by a blanket ---
text: zooms up onto a rocky beach, jumps out, pulls the boat into
text: the cover of trees. Grabbing his gear, he rolls out on foot.
dialog: 95.
text: Nate stalks to the top of a steep hill, beyond which is a
text: small bay -- built along its banks is the rotting majesty of
text: an abandoned 19th-century Turkish waterfront mansion or YALI.
text: Nate pulls his binoculars, scans the area and continues on.
scene_heading: EXT. YALI_ - MINUTES LATER
text: Nate skirts around the yali to find a huge window missing
text: its glass. He turns on a red-filtered flashlight, climbs in.
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM - YALI - CONTINUOUS
text: Nate prowls through the decrepit ballroom with a magnificent
text: river view. Footsteps CREAKING. RATS SCURRYING. Tension.
text: He glimpses a reflection in a cracked mirror and flinches --
text: he sees himself -- and behind him, Korch. Nate spins around.
text: Glad to see each other, they smile.
text: Nate steps in for a hug, but Korch holds him off.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I didn't know they were putting a
text: Keyhole above Vorkuta. The fuckers
dialog: kept it from me ‘cause they knew I'd
dialog: tip you.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: How bad was the blowback?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: Most are convinced it was a technical
dialog: breach. But there is at least one
dialog: element in the Center pursuing the
dialog: possibility of a mole ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Are you in trouble?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: You tell me.
text: Korch pulls out a photo -- the code on the back indicating
text: it's the one from Athens that freaked him out. He hands it
text: to Nate, who angles his flashlight on a distant surveillance
text: photo of himself, Luka, the girls and Dom, right after the
text: bird shit on him, everyone laughing.
text: Stunned, Nate looks up at Korch.
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: Her name is Dominika Egorov -- An
dialog: operations officer that was also
dialog: trained as a sparrow ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Fuck me ---
text: Korch pulls out a UV scope --- scans Nate head to toe. Korch
text: then snaps off the UV scopes lens exposing the light and
text: holds it up to Nate --- shirt and shoes glow with flecks of
text: spy dust, confirming the worst.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you knew she was on me, why did
dialog: you risk this meet? Why didn't you
dialog: just send a burst saying I'd been
dialog: compromised?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: I don't trust the people you work
dialog: for. I didn't know how they might
dialog: use it ---
text: Nate spinning out under the weight of what it all means ---
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: I need you to walk me through
dialog: everything, from the beginning.
text: LATER: Korch and Nate sit on the windowsill, gazing out at
text: the water. Nate wracked with guilt, devastation and shame.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: We all crave intimacy -- we are all
dialog: vulnerable to our desires ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: This wasn't like that -- I mean shit,
dialog: we never even had sex -- which is
dialog: maybe why I didn't see it coming --
dialog: (looks at Korch)
dialog: It felt like something else --
dialog: something intense and mutual --
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: Love?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: All I know is it felt true.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: Which is precisely what sparrows are
dialog: trained to do. Create the illusion
dialog: that it's real.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: This was different.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: You know what goes on in these
dialog: schools?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Yeah, I've heard all the crazy stories
dialog: about the sex ---
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: It's much more than sex. The training
dialog: these women receive systematically
dialog: makes them incapable of experiencing
dialog: any true emotion, except perhaps
dialog: fear.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: The emotions I saw in this girl were
dialog: too complex to manufacture ---
dialog: nobody's that good of an actress.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: Do you recall the suicide of Francoise
dialog: Guillot back in March?
speaker_heading: NATE
text: The NATO guy, slit his wrists in the
dialog: tub --- ?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: I'm sure he thought it was real as
dialog: well. As did all of her targets.
dialog: She's quite talented, this one.
text: Nate looks over at Korch and gets up ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Well then that's it --- you're comin'
dialog: with me. We'll exfil you right now.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: Out of the question.
dialog: (off Nate's look)
dialog: Defecting would take the power out
dialog: of everything I've done. If and when
dialog: they come, I want to look them in
dialog: the eyes. I want the satisfaction of
dialog: knowing they know.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: The fuck is that satisfaction worth?
text: Korch doesn't respond. Nate's so frustrated he looks like he
text: wants to smash something. He takes a breath.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
text: We have a tap on a trunk line linking
dialog: the Ministry of Defense with some of
dialog: your key research facilities,
dialog: including Vorkuta. If they want a
dialog: technical breach, I can give this to
dialog: you wrapped in a bow. Use it to cover
dialog: your ass.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: It can't come from me. There'll be
dialog: too many questions.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Then I'll get it done from our side.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: Knowing the value of that tap, I
dialog: highly doubt you'll be successful,
dialog: but if you were, it might help.
text: Korch checks his watch, gets up.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: How much are you going to tell
dialog: Benford?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Everything.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: But the consequences ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Doesn't matter anymore. I'm done
dialog: with all this shit. I want out of
dialog: everything -- for good.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI
dialog: (proud smile)
dialog: I'm so glad to hear this --- nothing
dialog: could make me happier.
text: Nate looks down, struggling not to lose his shit.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (CONT'D)
dialog: Nathan --- look at me ---
dialog: (Nate looks at him)
dialog: No matter what happens, in the book
dialog: of my life, you will always be my
dialog: second favorite chapter.
text: They share a tearful moment.
dialog: 99.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. GRUMMAN HU-16 ALBATROSS SEAPLANE - NIGHT
text: Plane's in the air. Benford's sitting in a doomstruck
text: meditation, face like a clenched fist. Nate's next to him,
text: hunched forward --- boiling down.
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: Why didn't you tell us about this
dialog: girl?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I'm supposed to tell you guys about
dialog: every piece of ass I chase? It didn't
dialog: feel like she was working me. I fucked
dialog: up ---
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: YOU THINK! ?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You're the one who started this whole
dialog: thing, by allowing DCI Bush to put a
text: keyhole over Vorkuta, just so he
dialog: could look good for the president ---
dialog: might as well have held up a big
dialog: fucking neon sign to the Sovs, "you
dialog: have a breach!"
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: I did everything I could short of
dialog: resigning to stop them ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: That what you tell yourself so you
dialog: can sleep at night?
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: (explodes )
dialog: Hey, I fucking bleed inside for every
dialog: agent we lose!
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Then help me figure this out.
text: Benford gets up and paces around.
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: They've probably had a team ghosting
dialog: you since you first arrived in Greece ---
dialog: You missed your date, she knows you
dialog: haven't been home yet. (Beat) As
text: soon as her cousin Egorov knows that
dialog: Marble traveled and where, our boy
dialog: is cooked.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: NATE
text: Egorov's still a few steps behind
dialog: us. We have time to make a move ---
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: What move?
speaker_heading: NATE
text: Counterintelligence is focused on a
dialog: technical breach. If we can give
dialog: them our line tap, it'll explain
dialog: everything and neutralize Egorov.
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: You're talking about blowing the one
dialog: of the most important SIGINT streams
dialog: we've got on the Soviets. Do you
dialog: have any idea of what it took to put
dialog: that tap into place? And there's no
dialog: guarantee if we do blow it that it
dialog: will save him.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: He's risked and delivered more than
dialog: anyone we've ever run behind the
dialog: curtain. Almost two decades ---
dialog: (locks eyes with Benford)
dialog: We gotta try, Sy. We owe him that.
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: I'll do everything I can to convince
dialog: the 7th floor barons ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Fuck everything you can, that was
dialog: yesterday. Today, it's gotta be
dialog: whatever it takes.
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: I need time to put all of this into
dialog: play. You need to see her again ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Not a good idea.
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: If you don't sell her on some
dialog: plausible explanation for where you've
dialog: been, none of this will work ---
scene_heading: INT. SUITE - SARIYER HOTEL - ISTANBUL - LATER
dialog: 
text: Korch climbs down the fire-escape, opens the window and slips
text: inside. Moving quickly to the unconscious Volontov and
text: hookers, Korch strips their clothing and scatters it around.
dialog: 101.
text: Laying a naked Hooker on the bed, Korch arranges the sheets
text: and pillows to make the bed looked soiled, sexed in.
text: Korch lays Volontov on the couch. An inspired thought --- he
text: drapes the hooker on top of him, 69-style so his old friend
text: will wake to a vagina in his face. After admiring his handy-
text: work, Korch grabs a vodka bottle and returns to the bed.
text: Stripping himself, Korch pours booze on his face and chest
text: and gets into bed. After a deep breath, closes his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DOM'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Dom awake in bed, eyes closed. Phone RINGS, she picks it up.
speaker_heading: DOM (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Yes? Yes, I was out -- no -- I just
dialog: was worried that -- It's okay. Yes.
dialog: So tomorrow night then.
text: Dom hangs up. Totally wired now, can't sleep.
text: We move with her to the kitchenette, gets some water. As she
text: comes back Dom notices a small paper that's been slipped
text: beneath her door. She picks it up, reads it and tenses.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - OFFICE BUILDING - ATHENS - MORNING
text: Dom enters and makes her way through the large, bustling
text: lobby of a modern office building. Cuts to the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - OFFICE BUILDING - MINUTES LATER
text: Making sure she is clear, Dom uses her tools to deftly pick
text: a locked door, opens it and enters...
scene_heading: INT. PHONE ROOM - OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
text: Dom stands before an open phone box, a massive grid of phone
text: circuits interconnected with colored wires. Pulling a
text: lineman's handset/voice scrambler from her purse, she finds
text: a circuit to wire into and then connects the clips to it.
scene_heading: INT. EGOROV'S OFFICE - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS
text: Egorov sits impatiently at his desk, staring at the green
text: phone. Through the window, we see his busy team. All the
text: intel on the boards is now devoted exclusively to Korch.
text: A red-bulb on the phone suddenly lights up. Egorov answers.
scene_heading: INTERCUT BETWEEN DOM AND EGOROV ON THE PHONE:
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: How are things proceeding with our
dialog: friend?
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Very well.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Did you go away with him, as indicated
dialog: in your last message?
speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Yes. The trip was extremely effective.
dialog: I was able to accelerate the pace
dialog: and establish an emotional dependence.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: When did you return?
speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Monday morning.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Can you account for his whereabouts
dialog: since then?
speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Why? Is there something I should be
dialog: aware of?
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: (after hesitating)
dialog: I've identified the most likely
dialog: candidate, and he's been in Turkey
dialog: for the last 48 hours.
text: Dom registers where Egorov is heading...
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
dialog: When were you last with our friend?
text: Dom sits with it for a moment. After a beat of struggling
dialog: with herself ---
speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: We went to the cinema and then dinner
dialog: last night. I was with him until
dialog: this morning.
text: Egorov has an intent look on his face, thinking.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Still there?
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I'm supposed to see him tonight.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Keep me apprised.
text: Egorov hangs up, wheels turning.
text: Dom hangs up, can't believe what she just did.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - MOSCOW - MORNING
text: Gazing across Korch's street, we see a Chaika limo pull up
text: in front of a apartment building. Korch gets out and enters.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - JUST OUTSIDE KORCH'S APARTMENT - BEAT LATER
text: Korch at his door fumbling to get his keys out of his pocket.
text: The door across the hall suddenly opens, Korch's neighbor, a
text: sweet OLD LADY, appears and greets him with an anxious smile.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Ah, Miriam -- going out for a stroll?
speaker_heading: OLD NEIGHBOR (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Yes.
text: Leaning in close, the neighbor grabs his hand and whispers.
speaker_heading: OLD NEIGHBOR (IN RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
dialog: They were in your apartment, the day
dialog: before yesterday.
text: After a hard gaze, she splits to the elevator. Korch opens
text: his hand, finds a paper with a licence plate written on it.
scene_heading: INT. KORCHNOI'S APARTMENT - BEAT LATER
dialog: 
text: Korch steps into his apartment, locks the door -- looks around --
text: everything appears to as he left it -- but nothing is the
text: same. He accepts this with a calm, fatalistic resolve.
scene_heading: INT. TAVERNA - PLAKA - NIGHT
text: Nate is sweating balls, uptight. Dom steps through the door ---
text: she's stunning. When she sees Nate, she smiles inwardly.
text: Happiness. She takes a deep breath to calm down.
text: When he sees her, he subtly girds himself. As she arrives at
text: the table, he smoothly gets up, pulls out the chair for her.
text: It's rather unlike him, and she clocks it.
text: Before he even says a word, she reads his body language. His
text: arms are crossed, eyes not meeting hers. Restless fingers.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: It's good to see you. I'm sorry again
dialog: for last night.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: It's okay, you tried to call, I wasn't
dialog: there. And I enjoyed the movie anyway.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (takes a drink)
dialog: Well I felt really bad. I've just
dialog: been dealing with the fallout from
dialog: some stuff. Been a rough couple of
dialog: days.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Is everything all right?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: (drinks, looks away)
dialog: I did something --- it was the right
dialog: thing to do --- but now I'm paying
dialog: the price for it.
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: Can I help?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I just --- I wanna be with you.
text: Under the table, he slides his hand onto her thigh and up
text: her skirt. As smooth as it is, she sees the aggressiveness
text: in his eyes.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
text: There's a hotel down the street.
dialog: C'mon, let's get a room.
text: Before she knows what's happening, he drops money on the
text: table, gets up, and reaches out for her hand. She's trying
text: to read him. Sensing something's off, she still takes it.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - PLAKA - LITTLE LATER
text: A bedside lamp dimly illuminates a small hotel room with a
text: view of the Acropolis. An armoire with large mirrors inlaid
text: into its doors faces the foot of the bed.
text: Dom and Nate enter... She takes in the space as Nate locks
text: the door and she moves to turn off the lamp...
speaker_heading: NATE (0.S.)
dialog: Leave it on. I want to be able to
dialog: see you.
text: Nate waits for Dom to come to him, so she does. They begin
text: to kiss hungrily, until Nate gently but purposefully stops
text: her -- then sits in the chair next to the bedside table and
text: stares at her standing before him.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Take off your clothes.
text: While maintaining eye contact with him, Dom slowly strips
text: everything off, laying herself bare. Nate breaks eye contact,
text: drinks in her body and then looks past it --- gazing at the
text: reflection of Dom's perfect ass in the mirror.
text: Dom looks back at her reflection in the mirror --- and her
text: eyes find Nate's in the glass.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get on the bed.
text: Dom pulls the covers off the bed and slides onto the sheets,
text: lying on her side, facing Nate... But he won't look at Dom,
text: only her reflection.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: No, not like that. I want you up on
dialog: all fours --
text: Dom throws Nate a questioning look in the mirror --- but he
text: gives her nothing -- just waits for her to comply, and so
text: she finally gets up on all fours, ass facing the mirror.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
text: Ass up, face down.
text: Dom throws an uneasy look at Nate who stays in the mirror.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do it.
text: She does it --- and Nate stares long and deep into her
dialog: reflection -- getting lost in that shit.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at yourself in the glass ---
text: Remaining in position Dom cocks her head back to look at her
dialog: reflection.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at me looking at you.
text: Dom looks at Nate in the mirror looking at her ass and body,
dialog: but not her.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now touch it ---
text: Dom touches herself, but with this command, it's now clear
dialog: to her, everything has changed ---
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me see you get yourself off ---
dialog: It's all in Dom's eyes the whole terrible realization -- "He
dialog: knows -- he knows who and what I am."
text: Dom shuts her eyes and shuts down -- we can see her entire
text: being go numb, her life force deaden -- and even though she
text: complies to Nate's direction, it's mechanical, no feeling or
dialog: pleasure to it at all. Just nothingness, until finally ---
speaker_heading: NATE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is bullshit. You're not even
dialog: trying ---
dialog: (stands, finally looks
dialog: directly into her eyes)
dialog: I'd rather jerk off to a Playboy.
text: And on that note, Nate blows out of the hotel room.

text: Nate stands outside the room, back to the door, hearing Dom's
text: anguished cries --- wallowing in his own devastation, until
text: he finally turns and disappears down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. EXECUTIVE HALLWAY - AQUARIUM - DAY
text: Korch rumbles down the hall like he wants to stomp some ass.
text: Everyone he passes stands at attention and salutes.
scene_heading: INT. ANDRE SOKOLOV'S OFFICE - THE AQUARIUM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Sokolov sits across from two YOUNG OFFICERS. Korch BUSTS
text: into the room. Sokolov is pleased to see him, but reading
text: Korch's anger, he waves off the officers, who leave.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Whatever it is, it can wait. We have
dialog: something more important to discuss.
text: Sokolov steps to his credenza, pours some vodka, hands one
text: of the glasses to Korch, who pours the liquid out in front
text: of his stunned boss and drops the glass to the floor.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Why did you want me to go to Istanbul
dialog: when you could've sent others?
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Your expertise made you the best
dialog: man. And the operation was a
dialog: tremendous success.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Bullshit. It was a ploy to get me
dialog: away so they could search my home.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: What?
text: Korch gets into Sokolov's face.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: 36 years we've known each other,
dialog: fought together, bled together. If
dialog: you suspect that I am a traitor,
dialog: then have the guts to say it to my
text: face, instead of conspiring with
dialog: those cockroaches from the Center.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I have no knowledge of any such
dialog: activity, but the fact that you think
dialog: I did ---
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I don't know what to think. All I
dialog: know is that they were there.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: The Dark Prince. Lieutenant Colonel
dialog: Ivanovich Egorov.
text: Sokolov processes what it all means, sits on his couch.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN) (CONT'D)
dialog: The only way Egorov would be running
text: a mole hunt is with the backing of
dialog: Grenchenko.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: But that backing was predicated on
dialog: the possibility that it was a mole ---
dialog: and now we know that it was not.
dialog: (off Korchnoi's surprise)
dialog: We found the line tap.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: When?
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Last night the 2nd directorate
dialog: followed an American operations
text: officer to a manhole on Warsaw Blvd,
text: near the Valensky Bridge. They
dialog: detained him as he attempted to
dialog: extract data recorders from a vital
dialog: trunk line connecting the ministry
dialog: with our Northern research facilities.
text: Korch absorbs the info, breaths a sigh of relief, but quickly
text: shifts into feigned rage and frustration.
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Right in the middle of Moscow! Right
dialog: under our noses!
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: At least it's over now and it's the
dialog: Center's mess, not ours ---
speaker_heading: KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: But this Egorov, he is our problem.
speaker_heading: SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: INT. EGOROV'S COMMAND CENTER - DAY

speaker_heading: TEAM MEMBER (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: (alarmed look to Kosolov)
dialog: It's Grenchenko.
text: Kosolov gives the guy a nod, he opens the secure door. The

speaker_heading: DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Minister, please, we are so close ---

speaker_heading: DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: I told you what would happen if you

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Two nights ago Korchnoi was in

dialog: from Nash in Athens ---
speaker_heading: DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: How could you possibly know that?
dialog: (realizing that Egorov
dialog: went around him)
text: A grave miscalculation.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: It's him. Mark my words.
speaker_heading: DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)

speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: We have a name for people like you

text: motivated by a misplaced love of
dialog: mother Russia, a perverse idealism
dialog: about Communism. We call you "govnoed" ---
dialog: shiteaters --- and have only the
dialog: deepest contempt for your kind. You
dialog: are the lowest of the low. Your
text: behavior is utterly incomprehensible

dialog: anywhere but the Soviet Union ---
dialog: Mongolia, Greenland, the surface of
dialog: the moon. And yet here you are in
dialog: this magnificent country, where you
dialog: can enjoy all the fruits of
dialog: civilization -- fresh food at the
dialog: market, soap that doesn't have lye
dialog: in it, access to whatever you want
dialog: to read or listen to. You can have
dialog: anything you want and yet what you
dialog: want is to risk everything for the
dialog: Soviet Union!?
dialog: (locks eyes with Elena)
dialog: You and your child deserve more
dialog: more than us, more than George ---

speaker_heading: ELENA

speaker_heading: NATE
text: Flight doesn't leave ‘til tonight.
text: Sitting next to Benford, Gable cranks a bottle open and
text: guzzles it. Stuffs the rest in his pocket.
speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: Got word from Gondorff in Moscow ---
dialog: looks like they bought into the line

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Not be you. (beat) As much as I

speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: I'll try to grease the skids on your

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Thanks, Sy.
text: Nate earnestly shakes his hand. Shifts to Gable. They hug.
speaker_heading: GABLE
dialog: Reach out to me whenever you get to

text: Nate's semi-napping. Green light. Traffic resumes.
text: Suddenly the van SLAMS its breaks. The taxi rear ends it --
text: Nate's HURLED forward into the back of the front seat --
text: just as a Mercedes rear ends the taxi --- wedging the taxi ---
text: As Nate recovers, SEVEN MASKED TERRORISTS with Ak47s explode
text: out of the van and Mercedes, quickly surround the taxi.
text: TERRORIST#1 holds an AK to the terrified cab driver's head,
text: reaches into the car, grabs the keys and tosses them ---
text: While TERRORIST#2 & TERRORIST#3 grab at Nate, who resists ---
text: Terrorist#2 SAVAGELY SMASHES him with the butt of his AK ---
text: As they speed drag Nate to the van, Terrorist#1 pulls a pistol
text: and shoots out the cab's driver side tires. Terrorists return
text: to their vehicles and tear off -- its all over in 45 seconds.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - ATHENS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Nate is pinned to the floor. Terrorist#2 holds a gun to his

text: Terrorist#1 flips Nate over and takes his mask off, revealing
dialog: it's Christos, Luka's cousin.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOS
dialog: What did you do to my cousin?

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: You gotta be shitting me.

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I didn't do anything ---

speaker_heading: BENFORD
dialog: You'll never find them.
speaker_heading: MARCOS

speaker_heading: GABLE

scene_heading: EXT. FARM - PELOPONNESE COUNTRYSIDE, GREECE - NIGHT
text: A remote farm in the Corinth region. Quiet but for the PULSE

text: The car stops in front, next to two other vehicles. The
text: DRIVER, a young Greek, gets out. Dom gets out of the back.
text: Dom sees a LOOKOUT with an Ak47 and is spooked. Has no idea
dialog: what this place is or who these people are.
text: The Driver heads inside. Paranoia growing in her eyes, Dom
text: hesitantly follows.
scene_heading: INT. FARM HOUSE - PELOPONNESE COUNTRYSIDE - MOMENT LATER
text: Dom walks in, sees 5 terrorists kicking it, listening to the
text: news on the radio. She immediately recognizes Christos,

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Ah. You're here. Would you like
dialog: something to eat, drink?
dialog: (off her head shake)
dialog: Come with me.

dialog: looks through it into:
scene_heading: A LARGE, WINDOWLESS ROOM, WALLS

text: Getting his bearings, Nate sees Egorov, then sees Dom ---
text: Nate and Dom are trying to not betray any emotion.
text: Egorov motions for Dom to sit in the chair against the wall
text: behind the camera.
speaker_heading: EGOROV
dialog: Your last name, Nash --- you of course
dialog: know what it means in Russian.
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Ours.
speaker_heading: EGOROV
dialog: Yes. But it has another meaning,
dialog: specific to the Kontora. When we say
dialog: someone is a "nash," it means he is
dialog: one of ours... An agent of ours. The
dialog: irony is thick, yes?
dialog: (off Nate's silence)
dialog: I am Lieutenant Colonel Ivanovich
dialog: Egorov. I am very please to finally
dialog: meet you.
text: A large suitcase rests on a card table. Egorov opens it,
text: reaches under the clothes, pulls up a secret flap to expose

text: arranges each item on the table.
text: Egorov straps a blood pressure monitor around Nate's arm,
text: pumps it up, takes his pressure and pulse.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (CONT'D)
dialog: Department 12 of S Directorate has

text: Egorov moves back to the table picks up an INJECTION GUN and
text: affixes a needle to it. Grabs an ampule of clear liquid.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (CONT'D)
dialog: Although they encourage talkativeness,
dialog: it is next to impossible to discern
dialog: the fact from the fiction in a

text: Moving back to Nate, he holds up the ampule for him to see.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (CONT'D)
dialog: This is what makes SP-117 so special.
text: Egorov snaps the ampule into the gun. Nate goes nuts trying
text: to bust free, straining so hard his nose starts bleeding.
text: Egorov waits for Nate to give up, then jams the needle into
text: his neck, injects the liquid, and stands back.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry, it won't put you into a
dialog: twilight. You'll be completely lucid,
dialog: but your imagination is inhibited ---
text: like a zoom on a camera lens, SP-117
dialog: forces the subject to focus on only
dialog: that which they believe to be true.
dialog: Interestingly enough, it barely has
dialog: an effect on women --- something to
dialog: do with hormones.
dialog: (hard glance at Dom)
dialog: But we're working on this.
text: After glancing at his watch, Egorov puts the gun down, returns
text: with a retinascope and checks Nate's eyes. The drug is already
text: starting to work --- Nate is trying to breath through it.
text: Egorov turns on the video camera, waits patiently for a bit.
speaker_heading: EGOROV (CONT'D)
dialog: Mister Nash, I'd like to start by

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: We had a date... I never showed.
speaker_heading: EGOROV
dialog: What was discussed at your meeting
dialog: with Korchnoi?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I didn't know about the Keyhole.
dialog: They were searching for a technical
dialog: breach --- but also a mole hunt.
dialog: Dominique. Korchnoi told me she was

dialog: a sparrow --- but it felt real...
speaker_heading: EGOROV
dialog: What felt real?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Us...

dialog: Perhaps you were.

dialog: What else did you and Korchnoi talk
dialog: about?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I wanted to exfil him, but he refused.
dialog: The line tap near Valensky bridge...
speaker_heading: EGOROV
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: I told Korchnoi we would blow it to

speaker_heading: EGOROV
dialog: And there's been no further contact

speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: No.
text: Egorov breaks into a big inward smile. He shuts off the

text: alongside FOUR OTHER TAPES.
text: Egorov snaps another ampule into the injection gun and shoots

speaker_heading: EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
dialog: Let's go.

text: hot lead igniting the curtains ---
text: As the flames grow, Dom aims on the door, waiting --- the
text: door swings open and she BLOWS THE LOOKOUT AWAY.
text: She stands breathing, close to overloading. Getting it
text: together, she's about to fire a kill shot into Egorov when a
text: bloodied Christos sweeps her legs --- she slams down onto a
text: coffee table, which collapses ---
text: Christos is immediately on her, pummeling her -- blood gushing
text: from his thigh and shoulder wounds as he starts chocking
text: her. She tries to push him off with one hand -- flails her
text: other hand out, desperately trying to grab whatever she can --
text: Dom clasps a pen, JAMS it into the bullet hole in Christos's
text: thigh --- as he recoils in agony, she grabs the back of his
text: head, pulls him in tight to her face and drives the bloody
text: pen straight into his ear as deep as she can ---
text: Christos SHRIEKS and withers --- Dom scrambles up, grabs a

scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - FARM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS - CAR CHASE - COUNTRYSIDE - MINUTE LATER
text: Egorov careens onto the two-lane highway, his bag on the

text: oozing blood. Every time he shifts gears he SCREAMS in pain.
text: Nitro in his veins, Nate stomps the gas, speed shifts, and
text: cranks the wheel so the car slides onto the highway and tears
dialog: after Egorov --- Dom getting tossed around ---
text: The Fiat's engine whining as Egorov fights through sweat and
text: blood to keep his shit together. Checks the rear view, sees

text: Nate gunning it full bore, gaining on Egorov. He slides the
dialog: AK to Dom.
text: She HAMMERS the windshield with the butt of the gun,

text: in her seat and kicks out the glass. The wind RUSHES IN.
text: Just as Egorov hits an incline, he checks his rear view,
text: recognizes the Mercedes bearing down on him ---
text: As the hill steepens near the top, the Fiat engine screams
text: in protest. He checks the mirror: the Mercedes is closing in ---
text: Egorov throttles over the crest. Olive groves on both sides
text: of him, he kills his lights, hangs a left onto a dirt road
text: and cuts through the trees.
text: As Nate crests the hill, he's lost sight of Egorov ---
speaker_heading: NATE
dialog: Where the fuck is he?
dialog: 124.
text: Dom spots the dust cloud between the olive trees ---
speaker_heading: DOM
dialog: There!
text: But they're already past the turn-off --- Nate slams the

text: their car --- Nate and Dom shielding their eyes --- trying
dialog: to keep track of the taillights ahead of them ---

text: four miles long, the canal's vertical hard rock walls drop
text: 300 feet into the water below.
text: Thirty feet away from plowing into the canal, EGOROV slows,
