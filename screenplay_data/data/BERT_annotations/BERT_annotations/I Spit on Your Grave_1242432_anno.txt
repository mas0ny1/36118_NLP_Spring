scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
text: JENNIFER HILLS races down from a stoop, a suitcase rolling
text: along behind her. Even dressed down, this city girl can't
text: hide her natural beauty and panache.
text: She makes her way across the street and to an SUV. she opens
text: the trunk and tosses in the suitcase among several other
dialog: bags.
text: She closes it, and walks to the driver's side. We see that
text: the entire cargo bay of the SUV is filled with boxes and
dialog: personal affects.
scene_heading: Al INT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Al
text: Jennifer gets in and slams the door shut. she takes a moment
text: to think, to breathe. Something is weighing heavily on her
dialog: mind.
text: After a beat, she glances up to the rearview mirror and looks
text: at herself. She take a long, deep, cleansing breath, and
text: then she turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.
scene_heading: B1 EXT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Bl
text: The SUV drives off down the city street.
scene_heading: C1 EXT. CITY OVERPASS - DAY C1
text: The SUV carves its way through traffic as the city looms in
text: the background, growing more distant by the second.
scene_heading: 2 INT. CAR, RURAL ROAD - DAY 2
text: The midday sun bakes the landscape as Jennifer drives through
text: a country road. A stark contrast from the city, and
dialog: absolutely breathtaking.
speaker_heading: GPS SYSTEM
text: Turn right up ahead.
text: Jennifer squints out the front windshield. The streets are
text: all unpaved and none of them are marked with street signs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 2.
text: Finally, Jennifer pulls into the driveway of a small house.
text: She picks up a piece of paper from the passenger seat, checks
text: the address on the house, and gets out of the car.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 3
text: Jennifer walks up the crumbling steps of the house. On the
text: screen door, a wire holds a wooden sign that reads; OPEN.
text: The screen door SQUEAKS loudly as Jennifer pulls it open.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Hello?
text: Jennifer cautiously steps inside.
scene_heading: 4 INT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 4
text: The sunlight shines through the dirty curtains. Dust clouds
text: hang motionless in the air, as if suspended in a solution.
text: Scattered across the floor are a variety of electronics in
text: various stages of disrepair. A handful of old, picture tube
text: TVs with their plastic casings cracked.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Hello?
text: Jennifer walks in further, trying to not step on anything.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: EARL (O.S.)
dialog: I'm a coming, I'm a coming.
text: From out of the back walks the proprietor, EARL (late-50's),
text: takes a double take at Jennifer, surely the prettiest thing
text: he's seen in a long while. He sees her standing in the
text: middle of the mess, suddenly aware of it. He bends down to
text: pick something up in a futile attempt to clean.
speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry about the mess.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: It's fine, really. I'm Jennifer
dialog: Hills. We spoke last week.
speaker_heading: (NO RECOGNITION)
dialog: I'm the one who's renting the cabin
dialog: on...

scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 3.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: (Jennifer holds a piece of paper)
text: .on Mockingbird Trail.
text: Earl's surprised.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Oh, you're Miss Hills.
text: Earl walks over to a cabinet against the wall, opens a small
text: drawer and takes out a key.
speaker_heading: EARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't suppose you know how to get
dialog: out there?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Afraid not.
text: Earl hands her the key. Earl pulls a map with some hand-drawn
text: arrows already on it.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Alright, listen up 'cause it's a bit
dialog: tricky.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: These here arrows will get you
dialog: through town. Over here, it's more
dialog: dirt road and woods so it can get
dialog: kind of dicey. We're a tad short
text: on street signs.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Well if I get lost I'll just ask
dialog: for directions.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: To who? Lady, the cabin is a real
dialog: beaut, but heck if there ain't
dialog: nothin' out there for a good
dialog: country mile.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
speaker_heading: (JOKING)
dialog: Well, I guess I don't have to worry
dialog: about bothering the neighbors.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Not planning on throwing a party,
dialog: are ya? The security deposit...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No, no. I'm looking forward to the
dialog: peace and quiet. I'm a novelist.
dialog: I'm starting my next book.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 4.
text: Earl just looks at her.
speaker_heading: EARL
dialog: Alright, well, if that's what
dialog: you're aimin' for, just follow that
dialog: there map.
text: Jennifer looks at the map.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY 5
text: Jennifer drives down the two lane road, barely passable by
text: two cars. She swerves as she glances down at map.
text: Then, up ahead she spots a small SERVICE STATION with a
text: single gas pump. She pulls up to the pump.
scene_heading: EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 6
text: Jennifer gets out of the car and fumbles to fold back the map
text: as she twists the knob off her gas tank and reaches for the
text: pump. A HAND comes down on top of her own.
text: Jennifer spins around.
text: Standing there, smiling, is JOHNNY. He takes the pump from
text: Jennifer and inserts it into her gas tank.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Didn't mean to frighten you.
text: Johnny is good-looking in a rugged sort of way. He's sinewy,
text: but athletic and strong. Jennifer regains her composure.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No, it's fine. I'm sort of lost
dialog: anyway. Looking for Mockingbird
dialog: Trail?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You are definitely lost.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Really? I thought--
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Nah, you sure missed it. It's a
text: good ten miles back, left turn
text: after the big red mailbox.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 4A.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh, okay, I think I saw that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 5.
text: Johnny flashes his smile, picking his teeth with a toothpick.
text: Jennifer stands there uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You, uh... staying at the cabin?
text: Jennifer hesitates for a second. Just as Jennifer opens her
text: mouth to respond, the shrill notes of a HARMONICA shatter the
text: silence. Jennifer turns quickly to the garage.
text: In the garage, ANDY, one of Johnny's employees, sits on the
text: fender of a broken down car. He holds a harmonica to his
text: lips. He's in his mid-30's with shaggy hair and arms that
text: look like they could bend steel.
text: STANLEY, one of Johnny and Andy's buddies, walks up behind
text: Andy. He's balding and overweight, and digs into a bag of
text: pork rinds.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Howdy ma'am.
text: He leans into Andy who continues playing his harp.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I'd sop that up with a biscuit real
dialog: good.
text: Jennifer turns away from the garage and looks back at Johnny,
text: who is still awaiting her answer.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Uh... no. I mean yes.
text: As she glances to the gas pump, Johnny looks her up and down.
dialog: She is definitely something to look at.
text: Johnny places his hand on the hood of the car. Glances to
text: the guys, then back to her.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You know, you're running a little
dialog: hot. Want me to uh... maybe I
dialog: should check under your hood?
text: Jennifer almost laughs at the way that sounded.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: How's that line working for you?
text: The gas pump clicks off interrupting. But Johnny just stands
text: there looking at her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 5A.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I don't know, how's it working for
dialog: you?
text: Johnny saunters over to the pump and in a phallic manner,
text: pulls the pump out. It gets laughs from the peanut gallery.
text: Jennifer looks away, a line has been crossed. She looks to
dialog: the pump again. $19.78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Let me just...
text: Jennifer fumbles into her purse when the map falls from her
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I'll get that.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No I got it--
text: Johnny gets uncomfortably close to Jennifer at the rear door
dialog: of the car when--
text: HONK -- HONK -- HONK - The SUV's deafening alarm blares out.
text: Johnny's startled, stumbles backwards, trips and goes
text: sprawling to the ground.
text: Jennifer, controlling laughter, holds up her keys and clicks
text: the alarm off.
text: Johnny is covered in dust and oil, struggling to get to his
text: feet while maintaining a shred of dignity. Jennifer
text: chuckles.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. I accidentally hit the
dialog: panic button. Are you okay?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I'm fine.
text: Johnny looks away, angry. He's certainly not the type of guy
text: who can laugh at himself easily, if at all. From the garage,
text: Stanley and Andy point at him and guffaw.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (from the garage)
dialog: Hey! You better check your
dialog: underwear, Johnny.
text: Stanley smiles and elbows Andy, but his mouth is too full
text: with pork rinds to actually laugh.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Yea... Check um' for skidmarks...
text: Johnny shoots him a harsh look.
text: Jennifer hands Johnny a twenty. Trying to contain her
dialog: laughter.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6A.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Sure you okay?
text: Johnny's eyes are cold, his face red.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 7.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I said I was fine.
text: Suddenly, Jennifer grows uneasy. She smiles uncomfortably,
text: gets in the car and drives away.
text: Johnny takes a bandana from his pocket and wipes his brow.
text: He watches Jennifer's car disappear and spits on the ground
text: as the laughter escalates in her absence. Johnny spins.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell are you two dipshits
dialog: laughing at?!
scene_heading: 7 EXT. CABIN - DAY 7
text: Jennifer arrives at the cabin. She gets out of her car and
text: stands there, looking up at it. In slight disrepair and in
dialog: need of a paint job but the quaint charm makes you quickly
dialog: forget its shortcomings.
scene_heading: 8 TNT. CABIN - DAY 8
text: Jennifer walks in with her bags, looks around the cabin.
text: It's rustic, but she's hardly roughing it.
scene_heading: 9 INT. CABIN, THE KITCHEN - DAY 9
text: She starts unpacking. A few cardboard boxes with non-
text: perishable food items sit on the counter next to cases of
text: bottled water. Also, there's a large wine case with
text: different liquor bottles in the sections. Jennifer takes out
text: a bottle of top shelf vodka and puts it in the freezer.
text: Then she begins to grab the wine bottles, taking an extra
text: second to look at one, the hell with it, she grabs an opener.
scene_heading: A9 TNT. CABIN - DAY A9
text: Jennifer sets up her laptop at a make-shift workstation.
text: Throws some freshly cut flowers in a small vase, a few lucky
text: figurines from her travels... it all feels very ritualistic.
scene_heading: 10 EXT. CABIN - DAY 10
text: Jennifer site at the end of the boat dock. Laptop and glass
text: of wine writing away. She couldn't be more content.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 8.
text: She takes a deep, replenishing breath, and then goes back to
speaker_heading: WRITING--
scene_heading: A10 INT. CABIN - DAY A10
text: CLOSE ON: Words fly across the screen as Jennifer types at a
text: furious pace. Blocks of text keep scrolling away.
text: Her fingers effortlessly swipe away at key after key, a
dialog: writer's high if you will.
text: Finally an exclamation point is stabbed with emphasis. Then
text: she hears a sound off in the trees.
text: She looks out and hears a very distant few notes of a
text: harmonica. Then a few even more distant "heeeeeeweeeee".
text: After a beat she innocently smiles figuring it's just some
text: boys off in the distance having a party or something.
text: Jennifer leans back, smiles briefly and pour herself a glass
dialog: of wine.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH - DUSK 11
text: Jennifer sits at the table, her laptop propped open in front
text: of her. She's talking away on the phone as she stops for a
text: moment to take a sip from a glass of red wine.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: .Lonely? Are you kidding? I
dialog: should've come out here on my first
dialog: book...
text: The wind kicks up and a in the distance a door is slammed
text: shut. It startles jennifer. She looks in the direction of the
dialog: sound.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, something just...
text: Another slam, and again.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Barb, hold on a minute...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 8A.
text: Jennifer sets down her lap top and puts the glass of wine on
text: the arm of the chair. She gets up and looks off into the
text: dusky woods. Then back to the house.
text: A light breeze kicks up and SLAM. Again.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Let me call you back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 9.
text: Jennifer snaps the phone shut, and walks down the steps of
text: the front porch.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
text: In response, she gets the frantic CHIRPING of crickets as
text: night encroaches.
text: Jennifer walks down a path and in the near distance she see a
dialog: SHED. SLAM!
text: The SHED DOOR is kicking open and closed in the breeze.
text: She makes her way towards the shed.
scene_heading: All EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK All
text: Jennifer gets to the shed. The door is wide open. She steps
dialog: inside.
scene_heading: B11 INT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK B11
text: Inside there is an array of old gardening tools. Pots,
text: garbage cans. Some different chemical bottles including a jug
speaker_heading: of LYE.
text: Jennifer thinks she hears something from deep inside the
text: shed. She moves in further as--
dialog: SLAM!
text: The door shuts behind her -
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Shit!
scene_heading: C11 EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK C11
text: Jennifer exits, and securely closes the shed door. After a
text: beat she smirks at the thought that she thought this was more
text: than just a door blowing in the wind, then heads back to the
dialog: cabin.
scene_heading: D12 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH -DUSK D12
text: Jennifer walks up to the chair, moves her laptop, sits and
text: then as she grabs her phone she knocks the glass of wine off
text: the arm of the chair into her lap.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 10.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Ohhhhh... You gotta be kidding.
text: She get up, looks at the red wine stain all over her lap, and
text: picks up her things to heads in the cabin.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Way to go Jennifer...
text: The last of the days light is disappearing.
scene_heading: 12 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 12
text: Jennifer stands at the sink, in panties and tank top - pre-
text: soaking her sweater and pants.
scene_heading: 13 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 13
scene_heading: POV THROUGH KITCHEN WINDOW:
text: Jennifer continues at the sink, her beautiful, partially nude
text: body is framed perfectly in the window for all to see... but
dialog: no one's around for miles...
scene_heading: 14 EXT. WOODS - DAY 14
text: Jennifer jogs through the trees. She wears a tight pair of
text: running shorts and a out off T-shirt.
text: Jennifer stops in a small clearing. With her hands on her
text: knees, she struggles to catch her breath.
text: She stands and walks in a circle, looks around. Checks her
dialog: watch.
text: Then notices something in the distance hidden behind the
dialog: trees.
text: ANGLE ON: A dilapidated shack, rotted from decay and neglect.
text: Jennifer's curiosity gets the best of her.
scene_heading: 15 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 15
text: She walks up to the shack, looks around. She then enters
text: through what is left of the front door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 11.
scene_heading: A15 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY A15
dialog: The place hasn't been occupied in quite a while, but it was
text: once. An old, dirty mattress in the corner... a sawhorse-for-
text: a-counter with old cans and bottles... even a rusty old
dialog: garden tool or two.
text: Near the window she sees an old, mold covered BIBLE propped
dialog: open.
text: Jennifer suddenly gets the chills, she shakes it off and then
dialog: gets the hell out of there.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. CABIN - DAY 16
text: Jennifer finishes her jog and returns to the cabin, leans
text: over on the porch and catches her breath.
scene_heading: 17 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY 17
text: Jennifer stands in front of the mirror. She looks at her
text: reflection and pulls out the band that was holding up her
text: ponytail. Her sweat-soaked hair falls across her shoulders.
text: She turns on the faucet and is met with a dirty spray.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Eww!
text: The spray only lasts a few seconds before sputtering out.
text: However, then the toilet starts to GURGLE. Jennifer lifts
text: the lid up with her foot. The toilet water bubbles up and
text: then disappears down the drain.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SHUDDERS)
dialog: Gross.
text: Again, Jennifer tries the sink, but now nothing comes out.
scene_heading: 18 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 18
text: Jennifer picks up her cellphone from the counter. She takes
text: a small piece of paper out of her purse and punches in some
text: numbers on the cell. After a few rings, voicemail picks up.
speaker_heading: EARL MESSAGE(V.O.)
dialog: You've reached the answering machine
dialog: of Earl Wooderson.

speaker_heading: EARL MESSAGE(V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The office is closed, please leave a
dialog: message and someone will call you
dialog: back on Monday. If you're calling
dialog: about buying or selling an exotic
dialog: animal, please leave your name --
text: Jennifer snaps the phone shut in frustration, when her eye
text: catches the water-damaged remnants of a service sticker
text: hanging to the refrigerator door.
text: Amazingly, the phone number is still visible. She shrugs to
text: herself and dials the number.
scene_heading: 19 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM -- DAY 19
text: She lifts the lid and looks inside - dry - and flushes a few
text: more times to no avail - then dirty water begins to gurgle
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
speaker_heading: (LISTENS INTENTLY)
dialog: No, it won't flush... I did that
dialog: already... yes... look, I'm really
dialog: in a spot... okay... thank you...
dialog: I'm not going anywhere.
text: As Jennifer snaps her phone shut, the handset gets caught on
text: her chin, and tumbles into the toilet. PLOP!
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh shit!
text: Jennifer reaches down into the toilet and immediately fishes
text: it out. She shakes it off vigorously.
scene_heading: 20 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 20
text: Jennifer stands next to the kitchen counter. She holds her
text: hair dryer which is going at full blast. Her cell phone is
text: propped open on the counter in front of her. She's doing her
dialog: best to dry it out.
text: Suddenly, a hand reaches out and taps her on the shoulder.
text: Jennifer SCREAMS and spins around, turning the hair dryer on
text: her assailant.
text: An equally frightened MATTHEW throws his hands up in front of
text: his face and SCREAMS just as loudly. He has several think
text: colored rubber bands on his wrist.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 12A.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: P1... please! I... I came to fix
dialog: the plumbing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 13.
text: Jennifer turns off the hair dryer.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW (CONT'D)
dialog: I... I was knocking on the d...door
dialog: a...a... while.
text: Jennifer breathes a sigh of relief, especially after she gets
text: a look at Matthew. He's in his mid-30's, but could pass for
text: a good ten years younger. Awkward and shy, he can barely
text: make eye contact with her.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
speaker_heading: (FRIENDLY)
dialog: I think you may have taken a few
dialog: years off my life.
text: Matthew doesn't get the joke.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh... thanks for coming on such
dialog: short notice.
speaker_heading: (NO RESPONSE)
dialog: You need to see the bathroom,
dialog: right?
scene_heading: 21 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY 21
text: Matthew works away underneath the sink. Jennifer watches him
text: from the bedroom sitting on the end of the bed, trying to
dialog: make small talk.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Is this gonna take much longer?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: (muffled, under the sink)
dialog: N...not much.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: So what's wrong with it?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Uh... it's just older pipes.
dialog: Matthew continues his work, you can tell he is uncomfortable
text: with the conversation.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: So do you live around here?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: No...no one lives around here.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 14.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yeah, I kind of get that. I meant
dialog: in town?
text: Matthew comes out from under the sink. He snaps nerviously
text: at one of the rubber bands on his wrist.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: My... my whole life...
text: Jennifer looks to his wrist. It's all red.
text: Matthew turns on the faucet. Out comes a hard stream of
text: cold, clear water. He flushes the toilet and then turns on
text: the shower to the same result.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW (CONT'D)
dialog: All fixed.
text: Jennifer squeals with excitement. She wraps her arms around
text: Matthew and plants a kiss on his cheek.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Thank you!
text: Matthew blushes furiously and fumbles his tools as he packs
text: up. For him, the kiss was more embarrassing than enjoyable.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. I just... you saved me
text: from having to bathe in the pond.
text: Once his tools are all packed away, Matthew dashes out of the
text: cabin. Jennifer follows him to the front door.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. Hey! I didn't even pay you!
text: But Matthew is long gone.
scene_heading: 22 EXT. FISHING HOLE - DAY 22
speaker_heading: ON MINIDV CAN LCD
text: A wooden bat crashes down on a fish. It goes still.
text: Stanley takes a MINIDV CAMCORDER away from his eye. He looks
text: at Andy who's holding the bloody bat, and takes a large gulp
dialog: from his beer, then--
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Ground rule double.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 15.
speaker_heading: ANDY
speaker_heading: (ANGRILY)
dialog: A double! Look at its head. I
text: knocked the eye clear out.
text: Andy has, in fact, knocked the fish's eye clear out. It lays
text: next to the creature, all weird and googly-looking.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Fine. Maybe a triple. But that's
dialog: it. You got to knock the guts out
text: its mouth to score a run.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Would you turn that thing off?
dialog: Gonna get us in trouble with that
dialog: human society.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Humane you dipshit.
text: Johnny site in a chair holding his fishing rod between his
text: knees. A cigarette dangles from his mouth and a beer is
text: perpetually glued to his hand.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I told you. This thing is going to
dialog: make me a fortune. All you got to
dialog: do is film something crazy, then
dialog: you send it into the internet, make
dialog: a killing.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: No one's gonna pay you for that
dialog: crap.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: It's the hits, Andy. You just
dialog: gotta get the hits.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Hits my ass, now you two retards
dialog: gonna fish or what?
text: Matthew comes crashing out of the foliage, knocks over the
text: cooler spilling ice and beer all over.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Speaking of retards.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 16.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Q..Quit it Andy.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Alright. Now we're all here,
dialog: what's the big show, Stanley?
speaker_heading: STANELY
dialog: The big show is this--
text: Stanley holds up the video camera like a trophy.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Are you kidding me? That shit?

dialog: lighting a fart?
speaker_heading: STANELY
dialog: Better.
text: Johnny just shakes his head.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: I don't know why I bother.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I got Matthew's girlfriend in a
dialog: private moment.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What do you mean like on the toilet
dialog: or something?
text: Stanley pulls a tape out of his pocket and loads it.
speaker_heading: ANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Matthew hasn't had a girl since he
text: was sucking his mama's titties.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Not true, my friends. And the
dialog: evidence is right here.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: What are you ta... talking 'bout
dialog: Stanley?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yeah, what are you talking about?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 16A.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: He had that babe from the city all
dialog: alone and he didn't even try to
dialog: nail her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 17.
text: This gets Johnny's attention. Matthew is snapping on of the
text: rubber bands. It's a bit loud. Johnny looks to him as if it
text: is annoying him.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What babe from the city?
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: You know, the one who stopped for
dialog: gas the other day. The one who
dialog: dumped you on your can. She had
text: Matty here fixing her pipes.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Bullshit.
text: Matthew snaps the rubber band more. Johnny turns quickly to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Cut that shit homo! How many times
dialog: I gotta tell you.
text: Stanley gets the camera ready.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: She even gave him a kiss for
dialog: "servicing her." Look, here's
text: Matthew running from the cabin like
text: a schoolgirl.
text: They all gather around.
text: POV CAMERA: Matthew runs from the cabin, dropping tools as
text: he goes. Jennifer stands in the doorway calling after him.
text: The camera goes closer on Jennifer --
text: The guys break up. Johnny is a bit more serious.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Now that's some fine camera work,
dialog: even better than the time you
dialog: filmed yo' self hangin' your nana's
dialog: cat.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What's this about a kiss?
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Matthew here says she gave him a
text: kiss right on the cheek.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 17A.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: No, she did Johnny. She kissed me.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Don't lie to me dipshit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 18.
speaker_heading: STANELY
dialog: If you all don't shut the hell up
dialog: you'll miss the encore.
text: All eyes turn to Stanley as Stanley pushes some buttons on
text: the MINIDV cam. Andy comes over and looks at the LCD screen.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Get ready for it.
dialog: ON MINIDV: The footage that Stanley shot is obviously the
text: previous night through Jennifer's kitchen window.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I'll be. Look at the rack on that
dialog: pony.
text: Andy punches Stanley in the arm. Johnny just stares at the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: ANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You dirty dog. Where the hell'd
dialog: you get that?
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I've been working nights.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Sure is something to look at.
text: Matthew is clearly uncomfortable, but he desperately needs to
dialog: be one of the guys.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Yeah, and she likes me... she was
dialog: nice to me.
text: Stretching a rubber band.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Nice? To her, you're nothing but a
dialog: shitter fixer. Hell, she wouldn't
dialog: even give Johnny the time of day.
text: Johnny snaps his head up and looks at Stanley.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Bullshit. I could tame that ass if
dialog: I wanted to.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You saw her Johnny... stuck up city
dialog: bitch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 18A.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Yea, girls like that think you're
dialog: hardly good enough to pump their
dialog: gas.
text: Johnny lights up another cigarette. He points at Andy.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 19.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Let me tell you something. I had
text: her creaming in her panties.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: And she had you shitting yours.
text: Least her car alarm did.
dialog: The guys yuck it up.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
speaker_heading: (SEETHING)
dialog: You don't think I could have her
dialog: anytime I want?
text: Andy looks away and begins to reel in his line. Stanley
text: stuffs his face with some crap so he doesn't have to answer.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Bitch like that comes up here for
dialog: one reason. Sitting in that
text: window, tits flapping in the wind
dialog: for all to see. You know?
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Nah... She's not like that, Johnny.
text: Johnny snorts, condescendingly.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: How do you know, ya fuckin' virgin?
dialog: Let me tell you something. They're
dialog: all like that! Fucking big city
dialog: cock-teasing whore is all she is.
text: He flicks his cigarette and it sizzles out in the water. Then
text: he gets right up in Matthew's face.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: You'd have no idea what to do with
dialog: a piece of ass like that. But
dialog: luckily I'm your friend.
text: Johnny hands him a beer and pats him on the back firmly.
scene_heading: 23 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 23
text: Jennifer writes away at the dining room table. She's on a
text: tear. A "writer's zone" where everything she types is gold.
text: She hits the "return" key hard, as if to punctuate a
text: particularly good sentence. She picks up some lip gloss and
text: puts it on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 20.
text: She leans back to take a break when her eye catches the cell
text: phone sitting on the table. She picks the phone up, flips it
text: open - It's still completely dead.
text: In frustration, she throws the phone across the room. It
text: hits the couch right next to the duffle bag. She smiles
text: mischievously to herself.
text: Jennifer reaches inside and withdraws a sandwich bag filled
text: with pot and rolling papers. She expertly rolls herself a
text: joint and lights it up. She closes her eyes. Bliss.
scene_heading: 24 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT -- LATER 24
text: From a distance, the cabin looks like a star twinkling in the
text: night sky. Trees sway in the breeze, dappling the light.
scene_heading: 25 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 25
text: Jennifer's head is slouched over her desk. She passed out.
text: Suddenly, A SCRATCHING NOISE at the front door.
text: CLOSE ON: Jennifer's eyes flit open as -
text: Jennifer jumps awake and walks over to check the door,
text: glancing at the clock as she goes. 4:14 am.
text: Jennifer gets to the door and listens, Nothing. She tries
dialog: to look out... nothing.
text: She turns to walk back when the scratching returns -
text: Jennifer takes a few steps back toward the door. Again, the
text: noise stops.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Hello?
text: Silence. Jennifer rises up on her toes and looks out the
text: glass window of the front door. The porch is deserted.
text: Jennifer opens the door slowly.
scene_heading: 26 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 26
text: Jennifer looks outside but nothing is there. Just a gentle
text: breeze and the sway of the trees. Satisfied, she walks out
text: onto the front porch, then down the steps. She hugs herself
text: and shivers, then she returns inside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 21.
scene_heading: 27 INT. CABIN, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 27
text: Jennifer shuts the front door and locks it. Then she yanks
text: on the door, just to make sure.
scene_heading: 28 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 28
text: She walks back in grabbing her glass and bottle when --
scene_heading: 29 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 29
text: The SCRAPING sound again, but this time, from UPSTAIRS.
text: Jennifer looks up, hoping that she imagined it. But there it
text: is again. She sets the bottle and glass down on the end table
text: next to the couch and then grabs a can of MACE from her purse
text: on the couch.
scene_heading: 30 INT. CABIN, STAIRCASE - NIGHT 30
text: She walks slowly, holding the mace directly in front of her.
text: Eventually, Jennifer gets to the top of the stairs.
text: At the far end of the hallway is an open window. A branch
text: from outside scrapes against the windowsill.
text: Jennifer lets out a sigh of relief. She closes the window
text: and heads back downstairs.
scene_heading: 31 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - NIGHT 31
text: She puts the mace back in her purse, and then picks up her
dialog: drink walking to the kitchen when--
text: BANG! Something smashes into the sliding glass door--
text: Jennifer SCREAMS dropping the glass. It SHATTERS.
text: With more than a hint of trepidation, Jennifer heads towards
scene_heading: THE SIDE DOOR.
text: With all the courage she can muster up, Jennifer unlocks the
text: door and steps outside.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 22.
scene_heading: 32 EXT. CABIN, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 32
text: The side porch light acts as a spotlight, illuminating the
text: culprit -- a lone bird lies motionless on the ground.
text: Jennifer bends down and picks up a small branch from the
text: porch. She gives the bird a small poke... nothing. But her
text: uneasiness is growing. Suddenly... SLAM!
text: She jumps and looks to the shed, the door is open again and
text: swinging. She looks to it thinking, "I shut that already..."
text: She moves off the porch and toward the shed.
scene_heading: 33 EXT. CABIN, SHED - NIGHT 33
text: Jennifer walks to the shed, it feels longer in the dark. She
text: looks around to the tree line, could be something out there,
text: an animal, who knows.
text: She reaches the shed and shuts the door again. She searches
text: the ground and sees a large stone.
text: She picks up the stone and shoves it against the door.
text: Satisfied, she heads back.
scene_heading: 34 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 34
text: Jennifer immediately goes over to her table where the laptop
text: is set up. She shuffles some papers around when-
text: Something on her laptop screen catches her attention. She
text: leans forward, brow furrowed.
text: ON LAPTOP SCREEN: A picture of Johnny, Stanley, and Andy
text: leering into the laptop's camera. Like a nightmarish photo
text: booth snapshot.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Nice shot huh?
text: Jennifer shrieks and spins around only to find --
text: Standing there, right inside the front door, is Johnny. He
text: smiles.
text: Johnny shrugs calmly and continues milling about the room.
text: Jennifer spins around, looking for a way out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 22A.
text: But Stanley has slipped in through the back door, video
text: camera obnoxiously filming the scene (which will be out to
dialog: throughout).
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Smile real pretty for the camera.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 23.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (her voice cracking)
dialog: Get out of here. Get out of here
dialog: right now!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Now that's not very hospitable, is
dialog: it?
text: Then, the wooden stairs creak under Andy's steps as he walks
text: down -- around his chest is one of Jennifer's bra stretched
text: to the limit. He's twirling a thong panty on his finger. The
text: guys get a good laugh at Andy.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: All of you better get out of here.
dialog: I called the police.
text: Johnny nods. He looks at her, his gaze mocking.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You called the police? Or you will
dialog: call the police?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I... I called them already.
dialog: They're on their way right now!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: With what phone? Matthew said you
text: dropped it in the drink.
text: Jennifer doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: (looks at Stanley)
dialog: Speaking of.. .where the hell is he?
text: Stanley takes a few steps toward the back door.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Matthew, get your boney ass in
dialog: here!
text: Shortly after, Matthew shuffles inside. He can't even bring
text: himself to look at Jennifer.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
speaker_heading: (TO JENNIFER)
dialog: Matthew here said you didn't pay
dialog: him for fixity' your sink?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 24.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: That is just not true! I tried to.
dialog: He ran out... (to Matthew) Is that
dialog: what you said?
text: Matthew winces and starts to snap a rubber band on his wrist.
text: as Jennifer walks over to her purse.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll take care of it--
text: Johnny cuts her off.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: --Let's not worry about that right
dialog: now.
text: Johnny hops up on the kitchen counter, cutting her off with
text: his leg. He then picks up the bottle of vodka, takes a swig.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now what's a pretty little thing
dialog: like you doing out here all alone?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'm writing. I'm a Writer... But
dialog: my boyfriend is coming up. He'll
dialog: actually be here any minute--
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: That right?
text: The guys give a good chuckle-
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I didn't realize you had a
dialog: boyfriend coming down. We'd better
dialog: get on outta here. Don't want to
dialog: ruin date night.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Date night.
speaker_heading: ANDY
speaker_heading: (CHUCKLING)
dialog: Date night...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You know what I think. I think
dialog: you're lying. There's no
dialog: boyfriend. No man in his right
dialog: mind would leave a girl like you
dialog: all up here on your own.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 24A.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
speaker_heading: (EMPHATIC)
dialog: No he's coming. He had to work. I
dialog: told you he'll be here soon.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 25.
text: Johnny turns to her.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Yeah, well so will Santi Clause.
text: Andy and Stanley are loving every minute of this. Matthew
text: leans against the wall, his eyes on the floor.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come here. Have a drink with me.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No, look. I have the money--
text: Andy slingshots the thong right at Jennifer. It lands at her
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What's a matter? Too good to drink
dialog: with us?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Please, I don't want to.
text: Johnny raises his eyebrows. The bottle is partially empty.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
speaker_heading: (TO JENNIFER)
dialog: Uh, what's this? It's already been
dialog: opened.
speaker_heading: (TO OTHERS)
dialog: See, she don't want to drink with
dialog: us. What are we, dirt?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I didn't say that.
text: Andy walks over and sits down at her desk, clicks around the
text: screen, begins reading aloud from the text...
speaker_heading: ANDY
speaker_heading: (READING)
dialog: .No one wants a phone call at 2
text: o'clock in the morning. When
dialog: you're fifteen it's a prank call,
dialog: when your twenty it's a drunk
dialog: boyfriend call, but after twenty
dialog: five, it's usually real bad news.
dialog: That's how I found out my father
dialog: died...
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Whose daddy died?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 26.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Can you all please leave me alone?!
text: Meanwhile, Stanley putters around the kitchen, opening and
text: closing the cabinet doors, knocking stuff around. He finds a
text: pack of rice cakes. He shoves one in his mouth, winces,
text: spits it out.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Damned cardboard. You eat this
dialog: shit?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You should! Do you some good.
text: Andy turns from the desk, strikes a match and flicks it at
dialog: Jennifer,
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Look, can you just tell me what you
dialog: want? What do you want? I offered
dialog: you money.
text: Johnny stubbornly holds out the bottle of vodka. Andy
text: giggles. He finds this quite funny.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
speaker_heading: (EXTENDING BOTTLE)
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Fine, if you'll leave I'll take a
dialog: drink.
text: Jennifer studies the bottle and finally accepts it. Drinks a
text: small sip. They all start booing.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Come on. You can do better than
dialog: that. I bet when you're out there
dialog: with your city friends you can throw
dialog: 'em back with the best of them.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I took the drink, now you--
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I said drink it!
text: Jennifer grows increasingly nervous and reluctantly takes a
text: nice swig. Then chokes and gags. They all cheer.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 27.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: See? Now was that so bad?
text: Johnny takes the bottle back and takes a swig himself.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Look, I'm sorry if I embarrassed
dialog: you the other day, but we're even
dialog: now, right? Okay. Please. Leave.
text: Andy and Stanley plop themselves down on the couch and prop
text: their feet up on the wood and glass coffee table.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Oh... that's not what this is
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Then what is this about?
text: Johnny jumps down from the counter. He stands in front of
text: Jennifer, towering over her.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: I want to see your teeth.
text: As if the air is sucked out of the room. Jennifer stares at
text: him, not even sure she heard him correctly.
text: Matthew snaps the rubber band harder. He moves to the far
text: corner of the room and tucks himself against the wall.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Wha... what?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: You heard me, show Horse. Show me
dialog: your teeth.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: That's... I'm not going to...
dialog: please leave.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: (quiet, but firm)
dialog: Show the teeth...
text: Andy walks over and hands Johnny the small wooden bat he used
text: to kill the fish. Johnny smacks it against his palm.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: .or lose the teeth.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 27A.
text: Andy walks back to the couch and flicks another match at
text: Jennifer. She recoils with fear as she reluctantly gives a
text: half-smile, her teeth clenched together.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 28.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
text: No. Put two fingers in the side of
dialog: your mouth. Then two fingers in
dialog: the other side... and pull.
text: Jennifer looks at Johnny like he's seriously disturbed as
text: Johnny slaps the bat against his hand punctuating his point.
text: Jennifer puts her fingers in her mouth. She pulls her lips
text: away from the gums, spreading them grotesquely. It's
text: completely humiliating. Jennifer stops.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Now please... I'm begging you...
text: Johnny slides off the counter.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Uh, uh. Again.
text: Jennifer reinserts her fingers and pulls. Johnny reaches
text: into her mouth and grabs a hold of her two front teeth with
text: his thumb and forefinger.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright. Good girl, Show Horse.
text: Johnny pulls down on Jennifer's teeth, forcing her to the
text: floor. Jennifer looks as if she's about to cry, near her on
text: the ground is the broken glass.
text: Stanley and Andy needle each other like schoolboys. Matthew
text: shuffles nervously, clearly uncomfortable at being there.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll tell you something
dialog: sweetheart... know why you ain't
dialog: got no boyfriend?... 'Cause all
dialog: them city guys are faggots.
text: Johnny turns to her.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: But uh... since he isn't here.
text: Johnny pulls out his revolver.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is your man.
text: He moves closer to her, rubbing the gun against her cheek,
text: her chin. The blood drains from her face as -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 29.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Why don't you give him a kiss-
text: With terror in her eyes, Jennifer quickly kisses the gun-
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nah, not like the peck you gave
dialog: Matthew... let's see a real kiss.
text: He slides the barrel into Jennifer's mouth. Jennifer gags
text: instinctively. Johnny holds the back of her head, not
text: allowing her to pull away, and offers some "encouragement."
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Breathe through your nose. Breathe
dialog: through your nose like it was your
dialog: first time.
text: Johnny pulls the gun out just a tiny bit and pushes it back
text: into her cheek, causing it to bulge out.
text: Naturally, Stanley and Andy both find this hysterical.
text: Especially once Jennifer begins to cry.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO JENNIFER)
dialog: On your knees.
text: Jennifer complies. Johnny holds the gun in front of his
text: crotch and again forces it into Jennifer's mouth.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: if I don't like your enthusiasm, I
dialog: may cum early.
dialog: (cocks the gun)
dialog: And that's something you really
dialog: don't want.
text: Jennifer has no choice. She begins to fellate the gun, as
text: deep as she can take it without gagging.
text: Johnny closes his eyes and feigns pleasure. Finally, he's
text: had enough. He retracts the gun as Jennifer recoils, gags.
text: Her eyes begin to scan the cabin for any way out of this hell
text: as Andy stands up from the couch.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: My turn.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 29A.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Come on, let Matthew have a go.
dialog: It's his girlfriend and he hasn't
text: even wet his whistle yet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 30.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: I...I ddd...don't want to.
text: Johnny walks up to Matthew, angrily, and slaps him across the
text: face. He points to Jennifer.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: What do you mean you don't want to?
speaker_heading: (TEASING)
dialog: sh...she likes me... she kissed me.
dialog: Now shut up and prove it.
text: Matthew holds his fist against his face.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Aw, fuck it. I ain't waiting.
text: Andy grabs the VODKA BOTTLE. He walks over to Jennifer,
text: still on her knees, and positions the bottle right in front
text: of his crotch.
speaker_heading: ANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Suck it, bitch.
text: Jennifer opens her mouth and moves her head toward the
text: bottle. As she maneuvers the bottle-neck into her mouth, her
text: eye catches a large shard of glass next to Andy's boot.
text: As soon as Andy turns around to smile at his friends,
text: Jennifer grabs the bottle and cracks it upside his kneecap.
text: Andy immediately grabs his leg and falls to the floor.
text: The guys start laughing as--
text: Jennifer leaps up from the floor and rushes over to her
text: purse. She quickly pulls out a canister of mace -
text: Before the guys even register what is happening Jennifer is
dialog: racing at Stanley --
text: As he brings the camera down he's met with a spray of mace.
text: He clutches his face, screaming in pain --
text: And like that - Jennifer is out the back door.
scene_heading: 35 EXT. CABIN - DAWN 35
text: Jennifer leaps over the porch steps and sprints across the
text: backyard as the first light creeps through the trees. Within
text: seconds, she's in the woods.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 31.
scene_heading: 36 EXT. WOODS - DAWN 36
text: Jennifer runs for all she's worth. Every few yards, she
text: looks behind her, just to make sure that no one is chasing
text: her. The morning light now fully visible. Then, just as she
text: turns back around, Jennifer smacks right into something and
text: goes sprawling.
text: When her vision comes into focus she sees the side of a shiny
text: black boot. Next to it, the long slim barrel of a shotgun.
text: Jennifer looks up at the figure.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa there. Easy
dialog: darlin'.
text: The Figure extends his hand. As Jennifer reaches for it, she
text: sees his jacket pull away from his chest, revealing a silver
text: badge. She's found SHERIFF STORCH, a small town sheriff with
text: a small town charm that can easily be confused as smarmy.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Help me. Please!
text: Standing next to the Sheriff, also holding a hunting rifle,
text: is Earl. Earl looks over at the Sheriff.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I was assaulted! They broke into

text: Jennifer breaks down again.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Ma'am, please, you have to calm

text: But Jennifer is hysterical, desperately holding back tears.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER

speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Ma'am, It's okay. I'm the Sheriff.
dialog: You need to take a deep breath and
dialog: tell me what happened.
text: Jennifer forces herself to take a deep breath and manages to
text: pull herself together.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: Four men. It was four of them.
dialog: They broke into my cabin... They
dialog: assaulted me!
text: Earl just watches not knowing what to do.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Are you hurt? Do you need a

text: Jennifer shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, good. That's good. Did you
dialog: get a good look at them? Can you
dialog: ID 'em?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yes, I'd seen them before.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Around here?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
text: At the service station right

speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
speaker_heading: (TO EARL)
dialog: John Miller no doubt.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yes. They called him Johnny.
dialog: There was a heavy set guy too--

speaker_heading: JENNIFER

speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Me and Miss Hills are gonna head on
text: over to the cabin and straighten
dialog: 'em out.
scene_heading: 37 BRT. CABIN - DAY 37
text: Sheriff Storch and Jennifer pull up to the cabin. They both
text: get out of the cruiser. With his double barrel shotgun in
text: hand, Sheriff Storch begins walking up toward the porch.
scene_heading: 38 INT. CABIN - DAY 38
text: Sheriff Storch and Jennifer enter the cabin. It appears
text: empty.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Miller? Miller, this is the
dialog: Sheriff. if you and your boys are
dialog: still in there, you come on out
dialog: right now.
text: Sheriff Storch disappears into the kitchen for a second...
text: then back out as he makes his way over to the foot of the
text: stairs. He looks up the staircase.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Miller, if you're up there, you'll
text: be leaving by the window.
text: No answer. Sheriff Storch looks at Jennifer.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Stay here.
text: Sheriff Storch heads up the stairs. Jennifer, uncomfortable
text: at being left alone, backs away to the wall. Every noise,
text: every foot step makes her shiver.
text: After a few seconds, the Sheriff comes back to the top of the
dialog: stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 34.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
text: It's empty.
text: He walks back down.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: No sign of 'em. If they were here,
dialog: they're gone now.
text: Sheriff Storch makes his way through and walks back into--
scene_heading: 39 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 39
text: Jennifer follows him and watches as he inspects it closely.
text: His eyes fall on the box of liquor bottles.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: You here alone?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
speaker_heading: (RE: LIQUOR)
dialog: With all this?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I wasn't going to drink it all this
dialog: weekend. I... I planned on being
dialog: here for a couple of months.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Drink some tonight?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yes, well, they were. They forced
dialog: me to.
text: He moves away and walks back through the cabin.
text: As he does, he spots the glass shattered on the floor... and
text: the nearby THONG and BRA that Andy flung at her.
text: Takes a long hard look at them, then looks back up to
dialog: Jennifer.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: One of them, he was up there, went
dialog: through everything.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 35.
text: Sheriff Storch taps the broken glass with his thick boot.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: (pointing to the glass)
dialog: They do this, too?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Please, I don't care about those
dialog: things. They shoved a gun in my
dialog: mouth...
text: Jennifer breaks down again as the Sheriff moves toward her.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Okay, okay Ma'am. It's okay now.
dialog: Them boys are gone. You're safe
dialog: now.
text: Jennifer nods to him, still shaken. Storch looks to the lock
text: on the back door.
text: He walks toward the back door and turns the dead bolt back
dialog: and forth.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: back door)
dialog: Was this locked?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Yes. Of course.
scene_heading: 40 EXT. CABIN - DAY 40
text: Sheriff Storch steps onto the porch. Jennifer follows.
text: Sheriff Storch looks down and sees the dead bird at his feet.
text: He pokes it with the barrel of his shotgun.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: How long you been here?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Just a few days.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Anything strange happen before
dialog: this? You have a run in with any
dialog: of these guys?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No. Not really. I stopped for gas
dialog: and directions.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 36.
scene_heading: 41 INT. CABIN - DAY 41
text: Back inside, Sheriff Storch hooks his fingers into his belt
text: and continues to look around.
text: His eyes casually fall upon the roach sitting in the ashtray.
text: He picks it up and smells it.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Ma'am, is this your marijuana
dialog: cigarette?
text: Suddenly, Jennifer realizes that simple possession might not
dialog: go over in this small town like it does in Manhattan.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Uh... n...no. The men probably
dialog: left it.
text: Sheriff Storch walks over to Jennifer until he's standing
text: directly in front of her.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: You mean to tell me that one of
dialog: these guys was wearing lipstick?
text: Storch holds up the roach. Jennifer notices the lipstick
text: smear on the rolling paper. She casts her eyes downward.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: This ain't the big city.
text: Sheriff Storch stands uncomfortably close. Slowly, he walks
text: closer up to Jennifer's face, stares into her eyelids. Pulls
text: down one of them. Then the other. Then his gaze falls down
text: to her chest... her ample cleavage. His stare lingers a bit
dialog: too long.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Please, I swear. I didn't make it
dialog: up. I may have smoked a joint, but-
text: Sheriff Storch lifts his walkie-talkie to his mouth.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: (into the walkie-talkie)
dialog: This is Sheriff Storch. I'm at the
dialog: Mockingbird Cabin. I gonna need
text: some backup.
text: The words out of the Sheriff's mouth seem almost surreal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 37.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
speaker_heading: (BECOMING FRANTIC)
dialog: Backup? What could you possibly
dialog: need back up for? I'm the victim.
text: Sheriff Storch holds up his hand, cutting her off.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Ma'am. You've been drinking and
dialog: smoking marijuana, and you got
dialog: enough alcohol here to put our
dialog: whole town three sheets to the
dialog: wind. You're running around in
dialog: your nighty at the crack of dawn...
dialog: You need to see this from my point
dialog: of view.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What?! They were here! They
dialog: assaulted me! You've got to
dialog: believe me!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: I just want to get to the bottom of
dialog: it. You're making serious
dialog: accusations bout' boys I've know
dialog: since they was kids, and you
dialog: haven't been all together truthful
dialog: now have you?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Now please, against the wall.
text: Angry and ashamed, Jennifer walks over and places her palms
text: against the wall, her legs pressed tightly together.
text: Sheriff Storch inches up behind her. He taps the inside of
text: her thigh with his shotgun.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Shoulder width apart, face to the
dialog: wall.
text: Jennifer has no choice but to comply.
text: He pats up and down Jennifer's side. When he gets to the
text: swell of her breast, he slides his hand to the front ever so
text: slightly. Jennifer reflexively turns--
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Face to the wall!
text: Sheriff Storch puts his hand to the side of her face and puts
text: it to the wall. Jennifer cringes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 37A.
text: Then he kicks her leg out wide with a firm Boot as he starts
text: to frisk her entire body, creeping his hands ever so close to
text: her crotch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 38.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I want the whole story, now. The
dialog: whole thing.
speaker_heading: (SLOWLY)
dialog: Start with telling me what those
dialog: boys did.
text: A long, dreadful beat hangs in the air as--
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, and tell the truth, show
dialog: Horse.
text: Jennifer snaps her head around again to see Johnny enter the
text: cabin as Andy and Stanely push Matthew in front of them.
text: Johnny walks over to Jennifer. He stands next to the
dialog: Sheriff.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Better yet, let's show him. As I
dialog: recall, those pretty little lips
dialog: couldn't get enough.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
speaker_heading: (MOCK SURPIRSE)
dialog: Really?
text: Sheriff Storch then takes the barrel of his shotgun and
text: pushes down the top of Jennifer's blouse.
text: Jennifer's paralyzed as he runs the shotgun across her
dialog: nipple.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO JENNIFER)
dialog: They do this to you?
text: Jennifer is too terrified to speak. Sheriff Storch then
text: slips the shotgun down between her legs.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I asked you a question.
text: Jennifer trembles with fear.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Show him those teeth, Show Horse.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 38A.
text: Sheriff Storch brings the gun back up to her mouth - slides
text: it under Jennifer's top lip and pushes it up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 39.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Whinny.
text: With her top lip forced up by the barrel of the shotgun,
text: Jennifer can only make a GRUNTING noise. Sheriff Storch
text: takes the shotgun out of Jennifer's mouth and places it flush
text: against the side of her head. He pushes her to the floor.
text: Jennifer lets out a YELP as she falls.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: I said, whinny.
text: Jennifer makes a pathetic SOUND. Not really a whinny, but
text: more of a half-cry, half-snort. Naturally, this amuses Andy
text: and Stanley -- who is, of course, filming it -- to no end.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Oh, man. Oh, man.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
speaker_heading: (TO JENNIFER)
dialog: On your knees. And keep going.
text: Jennifer gets to her knees. As instructed, she whinnies,
text: interspersed with sobs. Johnny slaps her ass viciously.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Keep whinnying!
text: Jennifer looks up at Sheriff Storch with pleading eyes.
text: Sheriff Storch picks her up by her hair but--
text: Jennifer comes up swinging -- connecting with the Sheriff's
text: face. The slightest scratch across his lip.
text: Sheriff Storch turns beet red. He backhands her across the
text: face sending her back down to the floor. A thin line of
text: blood flows from her nose. The Sheriff looks over to Johnny,
text: licks his lip and nods his head.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Think you outta tame this little
dialog: mare of yours.
text: Johnny takes the Sheriff's lead.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Alright, come on, Show Horse. Get
dialog: up. Or you won't get a sugar cube.
text: Jennifer struggles to her feet. She stands in front of them,
text: defenseless. Johnny grabs her hair and pulls her head far
text: back. She lets out a half-moan.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 40.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO MATTHEW)
dialog: Take off your clothes. We're about
dialog: to pop your cherry.
text: Matthew shakes his head. His wrist is not beat red from the
dialog: rubber bands. Snap!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not asking, now cut that rubber
dialog: band shit faggot.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Come on, Matthew. You want to talk
dialog: the talk, then walk the walk, you
dialog: virgin.
text: Johnny flicks open a pocket knife. He tickles Jennifer's
text: bottom lip with the blade, then gently runs it down her chin,
text: past her neck, and between her breasts, just before stopping
text: at the waistband, then he slices the waistband of her pants -
text: her pants drop to the floor.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
speaker_heading: (TO MATTHEW)
dialog: Do it now. Or else I slice her
text: chin to cunt.
text: This gets Matthew moving. A few seconds later, he's in his
text: boxer shorts, with his hands crossed in front of his crotch.
text: Johnny grabs him and throws him up against the wall. He then
text: yanks his boxers down. Matthew immediately covers up his
text: crotch.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Matthew, what the hell? It's not
dialog: even hard!
text: Matthew sweats profusely.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Well, maybe it's not totally his
dialog: fault. After all, she's not doing
text: much to get his motor running.
text: Sheriff Storch looks back to Jennifer.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Dance.
text: Jennifer begins to cry again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 41.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it. Or else I'll really give
dialog: you something to cry about. Now
dialog: dance for the boy...
text: Jennifer starts to dance in the middle of the room. It is
text: sad, pathetic, and downright frightening.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Come on. Move that rear of your's
dialog: Show Horse. Prance for us.
text: Sheriff Storch stalks around her, taking it all in, then he
text: walks back in closer to her, in her face.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: You dance like that in those city
dialog: clubs?
text: Jennifer closes her eyes. Tears stream down her face.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: She dance like that they'd throw
text: her butt to the curb.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Prance like you mean it. Like you
dialog: do when you want to get laid.
text: With a swift, hard backhand, Sheriff Storch smacks her ass
dialog: and hard.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That'll get her moving.
text: The guys hoot and holler. Except for Matthew, who looks as
text: if he too is about to cry.
speaker_heading: MATTHEW
dialog: Ok..kkay, I'll d...do it.
text: Matthew walks slowly over to Jennifer. With no warning,
text: Matthew takes Jennifer's face in his hands and kisses her.
text: The men HOWL with sadistic glee. Jennifer slaps him right
text: across the face, then she tries to run but--
text: Sheriff Storch forces her to the ground. He walks up to
dialog: Matthew.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Don't waste my time you thickheaded
dialog: prick.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 42.
text: Johnny pushes Matthew down on top of her.
text: Jennifer instinctively swings and connects with Matthew's
text: face - He recoils in pain - but the guys cheer him on as they
text: decide to help him out. Andy tears open her shirt, Johnny
text: yanks down her panties. Jennifer claws and kicks at all of
text: them as she desperately tries to fight him off.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Get her legs!
text: Sheriff Storch kneels down and holds Jennifer's arms above
text: her head. Johnny takes one leg; Andy takes the other.
text: Matthew moves on top of her. Jennifer lets out an inhuman
text: SCREAM, the vocal culmination of it all.
text: ON JENNIFER'S FACE: Her eyes are tightly shut as she goes in
text: and out of focus.
text: Suddenly, a cell phone RINGS. Sheriff Storch looks down at
text: his pocket, then over to Stanley.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Put that thing down and hold her
dialog: arms, keep her quiet.
text: Stanley places the CAM on top of the table - it's still
dialog: getting everything.
text: Sheriff Storch walks a few paces away from the rape. He
text: looks down at the screen of his phone.
text: On the PHONE is a photo of an angelic little girl with the
text: banner of CHASTITY. Storch presses a button.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Hello, Angel.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (V.0.)
dialog: Hi, Daddy. You at the station?
text: Jennifer SCREAMS out. Sheriff Storch keeps his attention on
dialog: the phone call.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
text: No, Angel. Out on a call.
text: WIDESHOT: In the foreground, Sheriff Storch speaks casually
text: to his daughter. In the background, Jennifer's legs are the
text: only visual cues of the struggle that goes on right behind.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 43.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (V.0.)
dialog: Oh, sorry.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: It's okay. You need something?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (V.0.)
dialog: Daddy it's Sunday. You always make
dialog: breakfast before church.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
speaker_heading: (INTO PHONE)
dialog: Yeah, yeah... well, Daddy's busy,
dialog: Angel. Tell mother I'm running a
dialog: little late.
text: Sheriff Storch stares at the phone for a second, then slides
text: the phone back into his pocket. As he turns back around
text: Jennifer, with all her strength, bucks Matthew off.
text: The guys start laughing hysterically.
text: She finally gets her hands free and lands a barrage of
text: punches in Matthew's face.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Jesus, Matthew. You're getting
dialog: your ass whooped by a girl!
text: Matthew snaps: He wraps his hands around her neck and begins
text: pumping away like a lunatic. For some reason, the anger
dialog: allows him to perform.
text: Jennifer struggles to breathe. Luckily, before all oxygen to
text: her brain is cut off, Matthew stops. He SCREAMS as he
text: finishes. His hands fall from her neck as he collapses on
text: top of her.
text: The MEN all cheer as Matthew staggers to his feet -- weak.
text: He looks like he could throw up -- and he does - right off to
dialog: the side as the others just lose it!
text: Jennifer curls herself into a ball and SOBS.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
speaker_heading: (TO MATTHEW)
dialog: You can thank us later.
text: Matthew recovers, gets up and runs to the bathroom. Johnny
text: points to the vomit.

scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 44.

speaker_heading: (TO STANLEY)
dialog: Clean this shit up.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Make her do it.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
speaker_heading: (ANGRILY)
dialog: Just do it you piece of shit!
text: Jennifer grabs the end of the coffee table and forces herself
text: up. She steadies herself, keeping one hand on the wall, and
text: stumbles to the back door. Surprisingly, none of the men
text: attempt to stop her. They don't even look in her direction.
text: Jennifer staggers out the back door, trying to catch her
text: breath as she fearfully stumbles off into the woods.
scene_heading: 42 EXT. WOODS - DAY 42
text: Like a zombie, Jennifer shuffles through the woods, oblivious
text: to the cold air, rocks, thorns, mud, as her bare feet move
dialog: her along.
text: She desperately continues on through, looking for a way out.
text: But in her state, she has no sense of navigation. She
text: continues to lose herself further and further into the
dialog: forest.
text: As she finally steps into the clearing, the melancholy notes
text: of a harmonica shatter the stillness... She's made her way to-
scene_heading: 43 EXT. FISHING HOLE - DAY 43
text: Andy sits on a log blowing softly into the harmonica as the
text: rest of the guys lounge around casually as if they
dialog: instinctively knew she'd end up here. Jennifer is too
text: shocked to move, too tired to cry.
text: Jennifer tries to escape but Johnny stops her. He grabs her
text: by the shoulders and throws her to Andy who smacks her down
text: in the shallow water. Andy pounces down on her back.
text: Stanley kneels down right in front of Jennifer's face. He
text: places the MiniDV cam only a few feet in front of her. He
text: then turns the LCD so it's facing Jennifer -- so she can
text: actually watch herself being abused.
text: Andy pulls her eyelids wide open and holds them there.

scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 45.
text: Andy shoves her face down into the water - then pulls her up.

dialog: tries to breathe --
text: Andy shoves her face down again and again as Stanley films.
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold her head down! Hold it down!!
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Alright. This filly's got a few
dialog: more races to run--
text: Sheriff Storch approaches Jennifer. Although she can't even

text: Storch gets down into her face.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: I hope you got some fight left in

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
speaker_heading: (BARELY AUDIBLE)
dialog: Please. Please. I'm... so hurt...
text: Sheriff Storch spits onto the ground.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF STORCH
dialog: Not to worry Darlin'. I'm an ass
dialog: man.
text: Sheriff Storch takes off his belt and unbuckles his pants.
text: He kneels down behind her..
text: Jennifer SHRIEKS as her face contorts with a completely new
text: level of pain as her head is thrust back down.
text: Then, out of the corner of her eye, Jennifer catches a
text: glimpse of the Sheriff's GUN, still sitting in its holster.
text: Her eyes immediately go to Stanley who's busy swapping out
text: the MINI-DV tape and replacing it with a new one--
text: Then she sees Matthew leaning against a tree, a vacant look
text: in his eye twisting a rubber band through his fingers.
text: Andy site on is ass, playing his harmonica... Her eyes
text: continue to scan the area for Johnny who's nowhere in sight.
text: Then immediately her eyes dart back to the GUN.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 46.

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Don't be so proud of yourself Andy.
dialog: I clocked you at just over two

text: Jennifer musters up her last ounce of strength and gets to

scene_heading: 66 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 66
text: Johnny reclines on his couch, watching TV. One hand is down

text: Suddenly, there's a CRASH at his front door. Johnny looks up
text: and puts down the bottle, not overly concerned.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Hello?
text: No answer at the door. Johnny groans and gets off the couch,
text: annoyed at being disturbed. He walks over to the front door
text: and yanks it open.
text: The front porch is empty. Just as he's about to close the
text: door, he glances down. There's a dead bird on the stoop.
text: Johnny narrows his eyes and looks out into the night. Then
text: he closes the door and returns to the couch.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 64.
text: But as soon as he picks up the bottle, there's another CRASH
text: at the front door. Johnny, now pissed, races to the front
text: door and swings it open.
text: A second dead bird has joined the first. Without closing the
text: door, Johnny backs up into his house.
text: A few seconds later, he returns to the front door, pistol in
text: hand. He steps out onto the porch.
scene_heading: 67 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 67
text: Johnny holds the gun in front of him. He pivots slowly from

speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)

scene_heading: 68 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 68

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

scene_heading: 69 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 69
text: Johnny causally looks down - but this time it's not a bird.
dialog: It's a shoe... Jennifer's shoe.

text: Someone's gone too far. Then he hears something scurry off
text: in-the distance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Ah shit. This ain't good.

scene_heading: 72 EXT. CABIN - DAY 72
text: Matthew, disheveled and weary, stumbles up the steps of the

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)

scene_heading: 74 INT. CABIN, UPSTAIRS - DAY 74

scene_heading: 75 INT. CABIN - DAY 75
text: MATTHEW'S POV: His vision is completely blurry. He

dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER

speaker_heading: MATTHEW

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I know that, Matthew. Now come.

dialog: I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: (stroking his head)

text: around his neck.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: But tell me again, Matthew. I want
dialog: to hear how sorry you are.
text: Matthew's eyes fly open. Jennifer's hands jerk backwards.
text: The rope digs into his flesh. He tries to speak but his
text: windpipe can't produce any sound.
text: Matthew rolls to the floor, Jennifer never loses her grasp.
text: She stands over Matthew, twisting the rope as hard as she
text: can. His eyes bulge, the veins in his face protrude--
text: Realizing he's about to slip away forever, Matthew displays
text: one last burst of strength but Jennifer uses her leverage to
text: get her foot on his chest and pulls harder.
text: Frightened and furious, Matthew whips Jennifer around again.

text: Stanley waddles out the back of the shack. He stops. About
text: twenty yards away and sees JENNIFER leaning against a tree.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Why you little bitch...
text: Stanley races over - Just as Stanley gets close - SNAP!! A
text: hidden BEAR TRAP clamps down on Stanley's leg - the pain is
text: intense as he screams out - He staggers backwards and falls
dialog: to the ground in agony
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, God! Oh, my fucking God!
text: ON ANDY: As he exits the Shack to see Stanley on the ground
text: writhing in pain.
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Please! Andy! My fucking leg!
text: Andy races over to assist him. As he offers Stanley his
text: hand, he notices Stanley's eyes catching a glimpse of someone
text: behind him. But as soon as he turns, the wooden BAT, the one
text: from the fishing hole, catches him flush across the face!
text: He's down and before Stanley knows it she cracks him in the
text: back of the head.
speaker_heading: TO BLACK:
scene_heading: BACK IN ON:
scene_heading: 83 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 83
text: Andy's eyes flicker open. He sees a hand wrapping a rusty
text: wire around the contact of an old car battery. Then he looks
text: up and sees a bare light bulb flicker on.
text: He's draped lengthwise over a horse trough so his torso is
text: completely over the basin. His arms and legs are secured
dialog: with ropes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77A.
text: Suddenly, the sound of RUSHING WATER from inside the trough.
text: Andy looks down. A dirty hose hangs over the mouth of the
text: trough. Brown water flows from it... Filling it.
speaker_heading: ANDY
speaker_heading: (PAINED SCREAMS)
dialog: Help! Somebody! Help me!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 78.
text: His nose and face are busted - it hurts to scream.
text: With the trough filling up quickly, Andy realizes it won't be
text: long until the water is above his head.
text: He cranes his neck upwards. After all, were he to stay face
dialog: down, he would drown -- just like Jennifer would've.
scene_heading: 84 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE DAY 84
text: STANLEY'S POV: It's Jennifer and in her hand is his video
dialog: camera.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I know. You like to watch. Don't
dialog: you. Don't you worry, I'll give
dialog: you quite a show.
text: She sets the camera on top of a tri-pod right in front of his
text: face, frames up and hits record. She looks up to him.
text: Stanley's arms are tied behind a tree, his head is held in
text: position, duct tapped back against the tree.
text: His legs are anchored to the ground. The bloody mangled one
text: still in the bear trap that bites and gnaws at his leg with
dialog: every move.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Since you like to watch.
text: She flips the monitor of the camera toward him just like he
dialog: did to her.
text: She stands in front of Stanley's face. Stanley wants to say
text: something but his pain is too intense.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Can't talk, can you? Well, maybe
dialog: it's because you're hungry.
text: Jennifer goes to grabs something behind her.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, you have to eat some real
dialog: nasty shit out here to stay alive.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Bbbb... bitch! Let me go!
text: She grabs his nose and pulls open his mouth shoving a MAGGOT
text: INFESTED RODENT into his mouth.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 79.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: What's wrong, you don't like it? I
dialog: prefer the maggots to the meat.
text: Jennifer site down next to Stanley. She glances over to the
text: monitor to see what he is looking at. Then she reaches over
text: and into a burlap sack.
text: Stanley stares straight ahead, at the monitor in front of
dialog: him.
text: Jennifer reaches into the burlap bag and takes out a roll of
text: fishing line. Then she takes out a pack of fish hooks.
text: Stanley's eyes go wide.
text: Jennifer removes the hooks from their package. She holds one
text: between her thumb and forefinger and studies the barbed tip.
text: Smiling to herself, she threads the hooks with fishing line.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Wh...what are you doing with that?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
speaker_heading: (LAUGHS)
dialog: Oh... just some fishing. I know
dialog: how much you guys like to fish.
text: Finally, when she's finished, she scurries behind Stanley's
text: head. From behind him, she grabs his eyelid and pulls it
text: away from the eyeball itself.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What are you.. Please don't...
text: Then she pops the hook through the lid and pulls the fishing
text: line back over his head.
text: Stanley screams something fierce as she continues to thread
text: his eyelid open, slowly, methodically, delivering as much
text: pain with every pull of the line, from one eye to the next.
text: His eyeballs bulge unnaturally, twitching wildly--
text: All Stanley can do is stare ahead and watch himself on the
dialog: monitor.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I'll be back before you have a
dialog: chance to blink.
text: Jennifer stands up and brushes herself off and walks to--
text: WITH ANDY: Jennifer comes over and slaps him in the head.

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Please... please... I can't...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Please? I thought, no, I'm pretty

text: Jennifer grabs a wad of his HAIR and SMASHES his face into
speaker_heading: THE WATER-
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Suck it bitch.
text: She pulls his head back up.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Does that ring any bells?
dialog: Jennifer gets real close to his ear--
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: SUCK--
text: She slams his head back down and holds it - then up--
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: IT--
text: She slams his head back down again and holds it then up--
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Bi tch.
text: She holds his head down for a very long time as his body
text: struggles - then up.
text: Andy gasps for breath as Stanley's screams get louder--
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: I think Stanley's calling me. I'll
dialog: be right back. If you need me-
dialog: She walks off--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 81.
text: BACK TO STANLEY: Both eyelids hooked open, blood and tears
text: stream down his face, a gruesome sight.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Like the show so far?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Wait, it gets better.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Please... Please... My eyes... I
dialog: can't take it anymore... please...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Let me help you.
text: Jennifer takes a slender knife from the bag. Working
text: quickly, Jennifer guts a FISH.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, this might feel better.
text: She leans in and smears the bloody fish guts onto Stanley's
text: eyeballs.
speaker_heading: STANLEY
scene_heading: 85 TNT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 85
text: The water has filled up the trough and is overflowing. Andy
text: struggles to lift his head up to draw a few quick breaths.
text: Jennifer climbs onto his back and GRABS his hair pulling his
dialog: head up.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Don't drown too soon.
text: Andy tries to buck her off, gasping for breath, buckling
text: under her added weight. Jennifer slams his head back into the
text: water, and then up again... then down as she holds it.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold it... hold it... hold it...
text: Then she pulls his head back up as Andy spits water all over.
speaker_heading: ANDY

scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 82.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Now is that any way to talk to a

text: And back down with his head - it is exhausting to watch.
text: WITH STANLEY: As a single CROW shows up by his head.
text: He tries to look at the bird to see what it is doing, but he
dialog: can't move.
text: ON THE MONITOR: The CROW has jumped onto Stanley's head -
text: looking at his eyes -- It begins to peck at them. Stanley
speaker_heading: SCREAMS!
speaker_heading: ON ANDY:
text: Andy continues to struggle. A few seconds later, Jennifer
text: returns, carrying a large bucket.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm impressed. You got a lot of
dialog: fight in you. Let's see how you do
dialog: now.
text: Jennifer brings forth the bucket.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Wha-- what is that?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: oh, just some lye I found laying
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Jesus, please, what the - no!
text: Jennifer pours the lye into the bucket - the fumes make Andy
text: gag. But he holds his neck up as long as he can - he does
text: not want to put his face down.
text: Jennifer come around in front of him.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Let's see how long you can keep
dialog: that pretty little face of yours.
text: Andy strains to keep his head faced at her.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Fuck you.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 83.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You already did that. I didn't

dialog: fuck you.
text: Andy's neck is straining to keep his head out.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: That's an awfully big head you got.
dialog: Your neck must be getting tired.
text: Every vein in his neck now bulges. Andy's eyes start to

speaker_heading: ANDY
speaker_heading: (STRAINED)
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Andy?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Wh--what...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Fuck you.
text: Andy's neck gives out dunking his head in the lye bath. He
text: writhes with pain as he lifts it back out - BEET RED and
speaker_heading: BURNING--
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Ahhhhhhh!!!
text: Jennifer laughs and walks out of the shack as Andy gasps,
text: chokes and spits for his life as-
text: STANLEY'S head is covered in crows.
scene_heading: 86 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 86
text: The crows jump all over pecking at Stanley's eyes, his cheeks
text: - he is a bloody mess as he lets out a final guttural scream!
scene_heading: A86 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK A86
text: Andy's body continues to writhe in pain. With yet another
text: burst of strength he lifts his head out of the lye-bath
text: revealing a face burnt red, puffy, oozing puss, skin flaking
text: off and his eyes are a ghastly, milky white, pussy, and
dialog: bloody.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 83A.
text: Finally his body stops convulsing. His head and midsection
text: drop into the water. Blood seeps up the surface from his
dialog: mouth.
scene_heading: B86 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY B86
text: Stanley is dead. His one eye stares straight ahead. Where the

scene_heading: EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: .since when? Since last night...
dialog: No Sheriff, I ain't heard from 'em.
text: Johnny notices something in his small surveillance TV.
text: ANGLE ON TV: A truck pulls up to the station, a hot woman in
text: a skimpy outfit gets out of the truck. She pops the hood
text: obscuring her once she does.
text: Johnny sits up in his seat.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, like I said, as soon as
dialog: dipshit or fuckface show up or call

scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 84.
scene_heading: 87 EXT. SERVICE STATION - MORNING 87
text: A truck is parked at the pump. Its hood is up and a woman
text: leans over the engine. Her ass is perfectly framed in a
text: tight miniskirt, from which two, long flawless legs descend
text: into a pair of blood-red high heels.
text: Johnny walks over to her, wiping his hands on his bandana as
text: the woman shimmies her hips, almost inviting him to approach
text: her. And Johnny, being Johnny, doesn't need much.
text: Johnny is close enough to touch her. He snickers a bit,
text: never taking his eyes off her ass.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Can I fill it up for you, ma'am?
text: The woman wears sunglasses and slowly turns to Johnny.
text: Johnny takes a long look from bottom to top - and when he
text: gets to her face - it registers - but before he can do
text: anything, Jennifer swings a tire iron and catches him right
text: across the jaw.
text: A handful of teeth, ejected by a spurt of fresh blood as
text: Johnny falls face-first into the ground.
scene_heading: 88 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 88
text: Johnny is buck-naked. His hands are tied tightly together
text: and pulled above his head, running through an eye hook that
text: has been screwed into one of the shack's wooden beams. His
text: eyes flicker.
text: Jennifer walks up to him, right to his face.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (O.S.)
dialog: It's date night.
text: Johnny cranes his neck and twists his body to see who's there
text: as Jennifer walks out of the shadows. She saunters up to
dialog: Johnny.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Your mouth doesn't look so good.
dialog: Maybe you should--
text: With a massive TUG she pulls back on the bridle that bites

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oooh, you're an ornery stallion,
dialog: aren't you?
text: Jennifer tilts her head and looks at him, as you would a
text: fascinating piece of art.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess I'm gonna have to tame you.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Bithh...
text: With a bunch of teeth missing, Johnny's lisp is pronounced.
text: Jennifer saunters around him seductively. She removes
text: something from behind her back and brings forth a rusty pair
text: of pliers.
text: Jennifer steps closer.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Oh, that's the problem. You still
dialog: have some teeth left. We're gonna
dialog: have to fix that.
text: Jennifer clamps the.pliers down tightly on Johnny's tooth.
text: He tries to move but between the bridle cutting into his
text: mouth and the pressure on the tooth, it's sheer agony.
text: Jennifer jerks her hand from side to side, squeezing the
text: tooth as hard as she can in the pliers. Finally, the root
text: breaks free of the pulp and Johnny's tooth is extracted.
text: Johnny flails around in severe agony.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Save your strength. You got a few
dialog: more races to run.
text: Johnny screams something unholy. Jennifer holds the tooth up
text: in the air and inspects it.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: I have to admit, I didn't think it
dialog: went that far down.
text: Jennifer sticks the pliers in again, latching it onto another
dialog: tooth.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 86.
text: Johnny's eyes bulge with fear as he kicks and screams pulling
text: his shackles taut --
text: Jennifer rips down on the pliers - her face is splattered
text: with blood as the tooth comes free.
text: Jennifer discards the tooth and goes right back--
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: PLEATH--
text: As Jennifer begins to extract yet another tooth, Johnny's
text: weary body convulses in so much pain that he actually pisses
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY
dialog: Pleath...for the loth oth thod,
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: That's disgusting. Even your boys
dialog: didn't piss themselves. Be a man,
dialog: will you?!
text: Jennifer takes the bridle and yanks Johnny's around, the pain
text: is so bad he can hardly fight. He grimaces and spits out a
text: mouthful of blood at her.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Now that's not gonna get you a

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Aw... what's the matter Show Horse?

speaker_heading: JOHNNY

speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (SING SONG)
dialog: Look who's here. My boyfriend.

scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 87.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)

text: With every touch of motion, white-hot pain courses through
text: Johnny's body.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: Breathe through your nose. It
dialog: helps. You know, like it was your
dialog: first time.

speaker_heading: JOHNNY
speaker_heading: (SPITTING BLOOD)
speaker_heading: WHORE--
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: I hear sometimes a stallion can get

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You just have to find it. There's

dialog: Do you, Johnny? I do.
text: She walks away from Johnny and picks up the rusted old
dialog: gardening sheer.
text: She walks back to Johnny, menacingly slicing the sheer
dialog: open... closed.. And again...
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: You slice off every ounce of their
dialog: foul manhood.
text: She slices it closed again.
text: As Jennifer closes in, the look in Johnny's face says it all.
dialog: But there is simply nothing he can do about it.
dialog:

scene_heading: ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 88.

speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: You geld them.
text: SLICE! - Johnny's eyes rolls back as he SCREAMS!!!!
text: She holds the piece of limp, pink flesh in her hand.
text: Despite everything he's been through, this brings forth an
text: entirely new level of pain. He screams and bucks as the
text: EYEHOOK continues to loosen.
text: Jennifer bends down for a moment, bringing something up from
text: the floor. She comes back to a screaming Johnny as she--
text: SHOVES HIS CASTRATED PENIS INTO HIS MOUTH.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER (CONT'D)
dialog: No teeth show horse... no teeth.
text: Johnny flails with all his might, screaming, spitting as--
text: ABOVE: The eye hook finally gives way. Johnny's tied hands
text: come crashing down directly on top of Jennifer.
text: Jennifer goes flying with a bloody enraged Johnny now free as
text: he grabs and claws after her.
text: Jennifer desperately kicks and scratches to get away from
text: this hideous, blood-soaked monster - but Johnny grabs hold
text: onto her leg - he drags her closer as she loses her grip--
text: With one solid kick, Jennifer connects with Johnny in the
text: face - he sprawls out from pain - as she gets up and races
text: out the door - Slamming it closed as she exits. She leans up
text: against it holding it closed.
scene_heading: 89 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 89
text: Within seconds the door is kicked at, banged at, punched at -
