scene_heading: OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS:
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN
text: PUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM
text: CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second
text: before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a
text: glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it.
text: Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs
text: (wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30,
text: sharp and prettier than she knows.
scene_heading: INT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING
text: Miranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on,
text: goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the
text: water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something
text: slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A
text: person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the
text: perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like
text: graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She
text: emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself
text: in a towel.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING
text: Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
text: Miranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial
text: analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast.
text: Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case
text: file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the
text: newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING
text: Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps.
text: Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers.
text: Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives
dialog: off.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR
text: Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets
text: her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the
dialog: wall:

dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: "WOODWARD FORENSIC INSTITUTE"
text: The gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as
dialog: we...
scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDA'S OFFICE - EVENING
text: Stark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the
text: according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces
text: a troubled young mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic,
text: deranged and forever trying to provoke. Mid-session:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: This is your stepfather who came
dialog: to visit you?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: My stepfather? No. He's dead.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I killed him.
text: Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough.
text: Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That's the first time you admit
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: So? There's a first time for
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (jotting this down)
dialog: It means you're finally past the
dialog: denial stage. This is good,
dialog: Chloe.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I never killed anyone who didn't
dialog: deserve it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You only killed your stepfather as
dialog: far as I know.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I should've taken care of my
dialog: mother. She knew all along. You
dialog: remind me of her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I remind you of your mother?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Always so put together. Like you
dialog: iron your underwear. Like your
dialog: pussy is the apricot of the
dialog: Promised Land and the bread of
dialog: the --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (getting her back
dialog: on track)
dialog: Let's get back to your visitor
dialog: last night.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: The Devil.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Alright, the Devil. Why would the
dialog: Devil visit you? It's already
dialog: hell in here, what would he have
dialog: to gain?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: He came to fuck an angel.
dialog: (giggles at that)
dialog: I'm his dirty angel.
text: Before Miranda can analyze that one, the room LIGHTS FLICKER
text: AND DIE. Darkness. Miranda's breathing speeds up.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: He grabbed me by the hair while I
dialog: sucked him and usually I love
dialog: that, I just do -- maybe you can
dialog: tell me why I love it so much --
dialog: but not this time, he was just too
dialog: rough --
text: As suddenly as it went out, now the POWER RETURNS. A
text: visibly uncomfortable Miranda checks the clock.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That's it until Monday. Try and
dialog: get some sleep tonight, okay?
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Sure, Doctor.
dialog: (leans in)
dialog: Crazy people hear messages from
dialog: God. Not the Devil. You know
dialog: that, right?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I didn't say you were crazy.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You don't have to say it.
text: She almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this.
text: Almost. TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door. Miranda nods
text: for them to escort Chloe. Chloe shakes their hands away
text: from her, strides off dramatically. The princess of the
dialog: asylum.
scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER
text: Miranda locks her office, armed with paperwork. The end
text: of another workweek. DR. PETE GRAHAM, a good ten years
text: older and Miranda's best friend on the job, approaches.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Dr. Grey.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Dr. Graham.
text: They walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues
dialog: who not only respect each other, but enjoy each other. A
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Power went out again in our wing.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (knows what's coming)
dialog: Same here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It's not shrink-appropriate to be
dialog: afraid of the dark, you know?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You're not shrink appropriate and
dialog: you're about to get promoted.
dialog: Everybody's afraid of something.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What am I afraid of?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yourself. At least you should be.
dialog: What are you up to this weekend?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Write a little country music,
dialog: decline invites to grand social
dialog: events, drink myself to sleep --
dialog: the usual. You?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Doug wants to look at some Real
text: Estate up at Willow's Creek.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Again?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: He thinks it's fun.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: So is golfing, I'm told. Who was
dialog: your six o'clock?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Chloe McGrath -- talk about trying
text: to empty the ocean with a tea cup.
dialog: She's a mess.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I hear Manhattan's full of them.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Don't start with that. I already
dialog: turned down the job. We're
dialog: staying.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Good girl.
text: They have reached an office marked "DR. PHILLIP PARSONS
dialog: DIRECTOR" and peer in to see Parsons (50's,
dialog: distinguished, commands respect from everyone) on the
text: phone. He gestures for Pete to sit. Miranda is about to
text: exit when he covers the mouthpiece --
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Miranda, my wife keeps wanting to
dialog: set that dinner with you and Doug.
dialog: Are you free tonight?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: He's stuck at a school board
dialog: meeting.
text: Parsons looks through his appointment book.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: You've been here a year already,
dialog: Dorothy's starting to take this
dialog: personal. How's next Wednesday?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Next Wednesday it is, Phil.
text: He nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone
dialog: call.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT
text: Miranda drives off, leaving the majestic grounds behind.
text: A GUARD waves her off.
text: END OPENING CREDITS.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
text: Miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up
text: ahead. A knocked-down telephone post blocks the road.
text: EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene. A patrolman waves her
dialog: down.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: SHERIFF RYAN, 40'S, recognizes her and ambles over.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Anybody hurt, Sheriff?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Nah, telephone post just decided
dialog: to fall. It'll take us a while to
dialog: clear this up so I'm afraid you're
dialog: gonna have to take the long way
dialog: home, Miranda.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: If you say so.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: And tell your husband he owes me a
dialog: phone call.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Will do. Wouldn't want him in
dialog: trouble with the authorities.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: That a girl. The law never sleeps
dialog: and all that. You take care now.
text: He taps on her hood and heads back to the site. She
text: shifts into reverse and makes a U-turn.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD MAIN ROAD - NIGHT
text: Miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge.
dialog: Something definitely creepy about this deserted place --
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING
text: Miranda dials a number on her cell phone, gets the
dialog: machine.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hi, it's me. Are you there? Pick
dialog: up, pick up. I'm on my way but I
dialog: just got detoured so I'm...
text: A bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the
text: passenger seat. She reaches for it and when she looks up
dialog: we see:
text: POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
text: A TEENAGE GIRL stands smack in front of us. Naked.
text: About to get pummelled by us.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing.
text: METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain control of the
text: car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT --
text: She looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing
text: back there. Drunk or high or in any case completely out
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Stay on the line. Don't go
dialog: anywhere. The weirdest thing
dialog: just --
dialog: (the phone cuts out)
dialog: Hello? Hello?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She stares at the dead phone. Punches the buttons on it.
dialog: No go.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Wonderful.
text: She tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car.
scene_heading: EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Miranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not
text: moving. Just standing there. Her back to us.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hello? Are you hurt? Hello?
text: Nothing. As we get closer we see she is covered in
text: bruises. Clearly something horrible has happened to her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Were you in an accident? Were you
dialog: attacked? It's okay, I'm a doctor.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My name is Miranda Grey...
text: And now she turns. Young, seventeen tops. Busted lip,
text: black eye. Miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around
dialog: the girl --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You're in shock right now, that's
dialog: perfectly natural. I'm going to
dialog: get you to the hospital. Okay?
text: The girl suddenly grips Miranda's arm. Hard.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Don't be scared. It's going to be
dialog: fine.
text: Now the girl is touching Miranda's face. Her movements
text: desperate, smothering. Like the movements of a drowning
text: person. Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hands off me, okay? Tell me your
dialog: name, do you remember your name?
text: The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead
text: she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell.
text: And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much
text: stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What are you doing? I'm trying to
dialog: help you --?!
text: The girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. And as
text: Miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the
text: girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body.
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAWN
text: Miranda wakes up in a cold sweat. Just a bad dream. A
dialog: beat.
text: FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER, we hear a REPETITIVE
text: SOUND outside. Like an ECHO of some sort, but vaguely
text: familiar: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP.
text: Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of
text: water on her bedside table. Except... it's not there.
text: She turns to her husband but he's not in the bed. And
text: now she glances around the room and realizes this is not
text: her bedroom.
text: She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark. Trips over
text: something. A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY. Her heartbeat
text: goes haywire. She feels her way along the wall to a
text: small opening in the door. A glass pane.
text: She peers through the glass at the empty corridor
text: outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's
text: inside a cell.
text: She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hello? Somebody help me!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
text: CAMERA SOARS through the tall iron gates, past the guard.
text: Now we spot the source of our continuing THWIP THWIP
text: sound: sprinklers watering the impressively-kept gardens.
text: The expansive complex is more Victorian campus than drab
text: prison, with separate wings (male and female), research
text: units, libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS
text: A bored group of female patients listen to a social
text: worker lecturing them. A janitor mops a long corridor.
text: Patients study at the library under the watchful eye of
dialog: orderlies.
text: A doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an
text: epileptic fit (we'll soon know her as SHELLEY). They
text: force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing
text: her tongue, prepare a syringe.
text: Institute director Phil Parsons at a meeting with other
text: doctors, discussing a patient's progress on a chart.
text: Now we are MOVING up the main building's wall and THROUGH
dialog: large windows into --
scene_heading: INT. FEMALE WING STAIRS
text: Pete rushes up two steps at a time, passing by a NURSE
text: WITH A CART OF MEDS, who nods respectfully as he goes --
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S CELL
text: An ORDERLY unlocks the door for Pete. Through the glass
text: pane he can see a visibly upset Miranda arguing with the
text: head nurse: a tough as nails woman in her 50's: IRENE.
speaker_heading: ORDERLY #1
text: Sleeping beauty is awake.
text: Peter forces a smile, enters --
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Peter, what the hell is going on?
text: Pete nods at Irene: it's okay, he'll take it from here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How do you feel?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How do you think I feel? Is this
dialog: a joke?
text: Peter is half-listening to her, half-signaling to the
text: nurse with the meds to come in. Miranda catches all of
text: this, growing more agitated. She wears the uniform all
text: patients wear: a white T-shirt and sweats. Her wedding
text: ring is gone.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Giving you something to calm down.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don't need to calm down. What I
dialog: need is an explanation
text: Pete grabs the meds from the nurse. Irene and the
text: attendant step closer to help. Miranda feels them
text: closing in on her. Peter's tone is infuriatingly gentle:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Just take this and we can sit down
dialog: and chat.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why here, why not in my office?
text: She looks at the silent faces around her. No sympathy.
text: Or maybe too much sympathy. Either way it's unnerving.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don't want an anticonvulsant, at
dialog: least give me Valium.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (nods at nurse)
text: Fifty milligrams.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Jesus Christ, you're gonna knock
dialog: me out? Ten milligrams.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (final offer)
dialog: Twenty.
text: The nurse complies. Miranda stares at the meds, trying
dialog: desperately to put this into some kind of perspective.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How would you feel if you woke up
dialog: in a goddamn cell, dressed like this?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We can discuss it at length after
dialog: you take your meds.
text: Awkward nods from Irene, the nurse and the attendant.
text: Pete holds Miranda's gaze. Miranda takes her meds.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Okay. This better be good.
text: Pete motions for the others to leave them alone. One by
text: one they file out and lock the door behind them.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - LATER
text: Miranda paces. Alone with Pete, she is even more upset.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Miranda, this is very awkward.
dialog: Technically I shouldn't even be
dialog: treating you but the court has
dialog: granted us a waiver until you're
dialog: transferred. So whatever is said
dialog: here won't leave this room. I
dialog: won't tell Parsons, I won't tell
dialog: anyone.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I want to talk to my husband.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You can't to that. Sit down,
dialog: please. Try to relax.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why would I pretend to be in any
dialog: way relaxed?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I understand you're upset. But we
dialog: need to put some things in order.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Two massive understatements.
text: He hesitates, unsure where to begin.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How long have you been here?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What is this? Why are you doing
dialog: this to me?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Just answer the question. Humor
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hi, my name is Miranda Grey. I'm a
dialog: psychiatrist. I transferred here to
dialog: the Woodward Forensic Institute a
dialog: little over a year ago. My job
dialog: entails dealing with a ward of
dialog: schizophrenic women between the
dialog: ages of eighteen and fifty-fife --
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I don't mean how long you've
dialog: worked here, I mean how long
dialog: you've been staying here.
text: This stops her. Wanting desperately to whip out a
text: comeback but realizing she doesn't know the answer.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'm a doctor, yes? Or was medical
dialog: school just an elaborate dream?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Of course you're a doctor. A
dialog: great doctor in fact.
text: The hint of sadness in his voice alarms her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Pete, how long have I been here?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Five days.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (barely audible)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You were admitted to the
text: neurosurgical unit seizing
dialog: violently. That lasted three
dialog: days. Scans revealed left-sided
dialog: weakness, numbness and severe
dialog: fontal lobe deficits.
text: Miranda shakes her head in disbelief, but we --
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - INT. NEUROSURGICAL UNIT
text: Miranda seizing violently FROM HER POV: Doctors
text: struggling to contain her. Arms thrashing, legs.
text: FLASHES of the wall, the floor. Head crashing against a
text: cart, out of control.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PETE (V.O.)
dialog: You came out of it and tested
dialog: negative for PCP, underwent
dialog: extensive hypnosis and received
dialog: amytal injections.
text: FLASH: Miranda being tied down. A nurse with a
dialog: syringe --
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)
text: She looks down at her wrists with the reddish marks.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You were tied down for a day and a
dialog: half so you wouldn't hurt yourself
dialog: and then you went into a state of,
dialog: well --
dialog: (how to put this?)
dialog: You've been pretty much catatonic.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This is the first time you speak.
text: Miranda, speechless. Reality sinking in.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Doug must be worried sick. I need
dialog: to call him --
text: Pete shakes his head emphatically.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You're the most logical person I
dialog: know, bar none. Plus you have a
dialog: photographic memory -- unconfirmed,
dialog: but you do remember events and
dialog: phrases more accurately than anyone
dialog: around. Why am I telling you this?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You're establishing my personality
dialog: as fairly intellectual, you don't
dialog: consider me impulsive or emotional.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And that's a fair assessment, no?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes, that's fair. And following
dialog: this pattern of analysis, we're
text: about to discuss a traumatic event
dialog: that rendered this psychological
dialog: profile useless, correct?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Two hundred percent.
text: A pause here. He's waiting for her to continue. She's
text: not used to being on the other side of the therapist's
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You think I'm in denial. That I'm
dialog: putting on a brave show -- that
dialog: this is a 'cover' for some
dialog: unbearable emotion I'm hiding.
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Don't analyze yourself, just focus
dialog: on remembering.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I remember Friday night after
dialog: work, if you say that was five
dialog: days ago --
dialog: (pushing on)
dialog: Anyway, I asked you what you were
dialog: doing for the weekend and you said
dialog: the usual and you made a joke
dialog: about writing country songs and
dialog: drinking yourself to sleep and I
dialog: told you I was going to look at
dialog: some real estate in Willows Creek
dialog: with Doug.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And then what?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Then I drove home.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And then what?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I got home, I guess, and had
dialog: dinner by myself because --
dialog: (pauses, struggling)
dialog: Because Doug had an alumni meeting
dialog: at his school and he was going to
dialog: get a ride back. He's the
dialog: principal now, as you well know.
text: She stops here. Pete waits. The silence is deafening.
text: She pushes on, but her hands shake a little.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: But wait -- there was an accident
dialog: before that, wasn't there? A girl
dialog: -- she had been beaten. I took
dialog: her to the hospital, right?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: There was indeed an accident, you
text: were detoured by the cops. But
dialog: there's no report of any girl.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No, the cops weren't there. They
text: were back on Main Road. A
text: knocked-down telephone post,
dialog: correct?
text: Pete nods. Miranda is all foggy on the details:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I saw the girl after that. She

dialog: him that night?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: My last -- ?
dialog: (frowns)
dialog: Tell me nothing happened to Doug.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Let's backtrack a second. You left
dialog: your office, you were driving home,
dialog: you got detoured by the police --
dialog: Did you call someone on the phone
dialog: that night?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don't know. I might have.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Who would you call?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I might have called Doug to tell
dialog: him something. Or checked my
text: answering service.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Were you seeing someone else that
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: There was some trouble in your

speaker_heading: MIRANDA

text: His face says he doesn't know how to tell her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Did something happen to Doug?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You don't remember anything else.
dialog: Anything at all?
text: Frustrated, she snatches his cell phone and starts to
dialog: dial:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: This is preposterous. What's
dialog: wrong with Doug?
speaker_heading: PETE
text: He's dead.
text: This stops her cold. Time stands eerily still. She
text: stares at Pete as if by looking at him long enough, he
dialog: will contradict his statement.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No, he's not. Don't tell me that.
dialog: Don't tell me that.
dialog: (sickened)
dialog: Are you -- sure?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm positive.
dialog: (painful beat)
dialog: You killed him.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Irene and TWO NURSE rush to Miranda's cell. WE HEAR her
text: hysterical CRIES from inside --
dialog: 19.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT
text: Pete struggles to contain Miranda, who howls
text: disparagingly.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It's going to be alright, Miranda.
dialog: You just need to sleep. It's
dialog: going to be alright --
text: Off Pete's nod, a nurse injects the syringe into
text: Miranda's arm. They hold her down with great effort as
dialog: she continues to cry, and we...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK SEQUENCE - SERIES OF SHOTS
text: A blur of images and scrambled snippets of memories come
text: at us rapid-fire, like a drug-induced dream:
scene_heading: EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Miranda's CAR SCREECHES to a stop and she jumps out,
text: glances around.
scene_heading: INT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
text: Graduation night. School principal Douglas Grey shakes
text: hands with proud parents and clumsily formal students.
text: Miranda grabs a drink from a nearby tray, bored.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (re: her drink)
dialog: Is that number three?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes, Mr. Principal. Special
dialog: occasion -- I'm celebrating how
dialog: proud I am of my husband tonight.
text: He smiles weakly at the compliment. Moves his hand
text: towards her, in an affectionate gesture (or so Miranda
text: thinks) but instead fixes her bra strap. Ever
dialog: methodical.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
text: Miranda and a man exit the theater. Giggling.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE
text: Doug laying on the floor covered with bloodstains.
text: Bloodstained axe on floor in f.g. Walls covered with
text: bloodstains.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT - NIGHT
text: A flustered Miranda fumbles with her purse and keys,
text: heads for the door. She tries to fix her smeared
text: lipstick and messed-up hair. TURNS TO CAMERA:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'm sorry. The fact is I'm
dialog: married and I -- this is not me,
dialog: this is a mistake.
text: First we hear our mystery man's voice, then we see him:
dialog: Pete. (Yes, the same person she kissed and went to the
text: movies with.) He places his hand on the door, blocking
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Your marriage is the mistake and
dialog: you know it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm sorry. That was out of line.
dialog: I feel like a school kid hiding
dialog: from the Principal.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: We are hiding from the Principal.
text: He smiles. Touches her face tenderly. Torn. A person
dialog: used to doing the right thing but not liking that at the
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I would just like to spend some
dialog: time together.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: We spend time together every day.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I meant minus the schizophrenic
dialog: women.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I have to go. I need time to think.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He nods. Opens the door for her. She starts to walk
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Don't be too hard on yourself, Dr.
dialog: Grey. You haven't done anything
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Not yet. But I want to.
scene_heading: EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - MORNING
text: PUSH INTO a quiet house on a quiet suburban street. Two
text: Volvos parked in the driveway. Perfectly-kept front lawn.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE
text: Another near-subliminal glimpse of Doug laying on the
text: floor covered with bloodstains. Bloodstained axe on
text: floor in f.g. Walls covered with bloodstains.
scene_heading: EXT. CHAPEL - DAY
text: Miranda and Doug laugh at their wedding. It's clearly
text: hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a
dialog: handkerchief.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick
text: streak of blood on it. She looks down at her hand,
dialog: noticing the blood -- and now we are back in --
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)
text: Miranda wakes up with a start. The darkness renders the
text: room almost void of any color. Monochromatic. It takes
text: her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander across
text: the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched.
text: We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like
text: somebody is standing over her bed. But we don't see
text: anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks
text: through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She
text: glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and
text: bangs on the door.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Can I get some assistance here?
dialog: Hello?!
text: She waits. Bangs on the door again.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Irene?! Anybody!?
text: A beat. And now finally we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING.
text: A light is switched on down the corridor.
text: The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER... and CLOSER...
text: Miranda tries to appear composed. Wipes sweat off her
text: forehead. Fixes her hair. The FOOTSTEPS now STOP right
text: out side the door. A KEY goes into the lock and JIGGLES
dialog: it.
text: Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens.
text: Confused, she steps up to the glass partition and
dialog: peeks --
text: The second her face touches the glass, she is met by a
text: pair of piercing eyes. The eerie teenage girl. Miranda
text: jumps back, screams.
text: And when she looks up again, the image is gone. A beat.
dialog: Rational thought kicking in --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (to self)
dialog: Wake up, wake up...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're dreaming. It's not real.
dialog: An anxiety dream, that's all.
dialog: That's all. This is dream logic.
dialog: If it was real, they would have
dialog: heard you scream. There are
dialog: twenty employees on the night
text: shift. Fact. At least twenty.
text: She props herself with her back against the wall. With a
text: view of the whole cell. Just in case. Staring at the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'm just dreaming.
text: And now, FAINTLY at first, but GROWING LOUDER --
text: FOOTSTEPS can be heard APPROACHING outside. Just like
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm
dialog: dreaming, I'm dreaming.
text: Like her life depends on that mantra. The FOOTSTEPS get
text: CLOSER. And her voice begins to falter --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (voice rising)
dialog: I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming --
text: And now the FOOTSTEPS pause outside her door like before
text: and she holds her breath, horrified, when suddenly we are
text: hit with the sudden glare of returning light.
text: EVERYTHING FLASHES WHITE and then COLOR RETURNS --
speaker_heading: IRENE (O.S.)
dialog: Rise and shine, ladies!
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY
text: Irene tries to shake Miranda awake. An orderly and nurse
dialog: stand by.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (shaking her)
dialog: That means you, honey. Up -- !
dialog: No reaction.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Rise and shine now. Wake up.
text: She shakes her harder. And now Miranda's EYES SHOOT OPEN
text: and she grips Irene's arm. Hard. Like the teenage girl
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Easy now, it's okay.
text: Miranda stares at her, coming back to. Starts to speak
text: but has no voice. Clears her throat --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I need to see Peter Graham.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: And you have a session scheduled
dialog: this afternoon --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Right now.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: IRENE
text: He's not even in yet, now let go
dialog: my arm, honey.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Doctor Grey, if you don't mind.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Actually I do mind. I start
dialog: calling you 'doctor' and everybody
dialog: else wants to be called 'doctor' --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Please. It's a bit different,
dialog: wouldn't you say -- ?
text: Irene reaches out her hand and the nurse places a cup
text: with meds on it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What do you think you're doing? I
dialog: want to speak to my lawyer --
dialog: wait, what are you doing?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: My job.
text: Irene shoves the meds into Miranda's mouth --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: C'mon, Irene, don't do this. I'm
dialog: calm now, look -- I'm calm -- !
text: She struggles as they hold her down and Irene sedates
dialog: her.
scene_heading: INT. REC ROOM - DAY
text: DRIFTING PAST the female patients at their usual activities.
text: Some watch TV, play dominoes, some pretend to read, some
text: stare out blankly. Here's Chloe at a table, engaged in
text: some sort of trivia game with a tattooed Southern redhead
dialog: named JENNA:
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: M.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Mallorol, Matzine, Megaphen,
dialog: Meallaril-S, Meleretten, Meleril,
dialog: Mellaril, Mellaril-S, Mesoridazine,
dialog: Methotrimaprazine, Mixidol, Moban
dialog: Modalina --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Modalina? Isn't that a band?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Trade name for Triflupoerazine.
dialog: Look it up.
text: Chloe shrugs, if you say so. Jenna resumes:
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Moditen, Molindone, Moltipress,
dialog: Motival. That's it for the 'M's.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Not bad. High potency
dialog: neuroleptics starting with 'J.'
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Trick question. There's only
dialog: Jatroneural.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: What do you wanna bet?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Bet you a soda.
text: Chloe checks a reference book. Nods, impressed.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
text: Right on the money, cowgirl.
text: Twenty points and a soda.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS HER INTENT GAZE to another patient,
dialog: SHELLEY (the same patient we saw earlier mid-fit)
text: moseying across the room. Nervously takes a seat beside
dialog: Miranda.
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Hi there, Doc.
text: It takes a moment for the heavily-drugged Miranda to
text: react. She looks up slowly: eyes glazed, painfully out
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: I never got shrinked by you but
dialog: all I hear is nothing gets past
dialog: you, I mean, that's just hearsay
dialog: and I don't pay much attention to
dialog: hearsay because now they say you
dialog: hacked your husband with an axe
dialog: but I say maybe it just slipped,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Miranda notices Shelley is toying with a wrinkled
text: NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. Shelley catches this look and slides
text: it over to her. Without malice, like a child.
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: They put your picture in the
dialog: paper.
scene_heading: It reads "SCHOOL PRINCIPAL SLAUGHTERED. WIFE UNDER
text: ARREST." Photos of Miranda, Douglas, their house.
text: Miranda stares at it in disbelief. Growing sick.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How did you get this?
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Chloe did. Who knows how? Not
dialog: me. Around here I'm on a need to
dialog: know basis about stuff and most
dialog: stuff I don't need to know. My
dialog: point is about people talking
text: behind other people's backs. Like
dialog: before I was here, everything I
dialog: did I thought, 'this'll get them,'
dialog: wanting their approval, wanting
dialog: them to say good things behind my
dialog: back. But now I'm more anonymous,
dialog: more myself. I'm Shelley.
text: Miranda slides the clipping back to Shelley, clueless as
dialog: to how to get out of this conversation, but Shelley has
dialog: no problem holding a conversation all by herself --
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: You're not like, undercover here,
dialog: are you? They pulled that at
dialog: Spring Grove, had a bunch of
dialog: doctors pretend they were
dialog: patients, see if they could handle
dialog: it. Most quit after day one.
dialog: You're not, are you?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No, Shelley. I'm not undercover.
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Because if you were, I'm like the
dialog: Fort Knox of secrets. Ask
dialog: anybody.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That's good to know. But I'm not.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Say no more.
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I understand perfectly.
text: She hands Miranda paper and some crayons, whispers:
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Drawing is a great cover. Good
dialog: luck to you.
text: With a wink, she's gone. Miranda looks at the room
text: around her: Chloe spying on her in the corner, Irene and
text: the nurse sharing a laugh, other patients ambling about,
dialog: arguing --
dialog: Life among the insane.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA - DAY
text: Patients undress in the bare-bones locker area. An
text: uneasy Miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by
dialog: Irene.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don't -- I think I'm alright.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: You go in last because you're
dialog: special.
dialog: (off Miranda's look)
dialog: It's not a Mexican prison, toots.
dialog: Everybody here minds their own
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: If it's all the same, I'd
dialog: rather --
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: State law says we keep you ladies
dialog: clean. And I'm a stickler for the
dialog: law.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now come on. If you go downtown,
dialog: you gotta dance.
text: Miranda studies the patients already under the spray of
text: the shower. Something vaguely concentration camp-like
dialog: about institutional bathing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: The shower, like everything else in this place, is
text: regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of
text: patients each get their turn. Miranda feels Chloe's gaze
text: on her across the room. She is stripping off her clothes
text: for Miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last
text: refrain from the Stones' "START ME UP."
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: (checking watch)
dialog: That's five minutes, group one.
dialog: (to Chloe's group)
dialog: Alright, ladies, nice and easy.
text: The first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past
text: Miranda, in all shapes and sizes. She registers their
text: many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls:
dialog: names of men, places, religious quotes. Burn scars,
text: cuts, needle marks. They begin to towel off as Miranda,
text: slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in
dialog: the corner.
text: A moment later Irene nods for her to go in.
scene_heading: INT. COMMUNAL SHOWERS - LATER
text: Miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her
text: eyes, trying to shut it all out.
text: The SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda
text: and her RAGGED BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last
text: two out from the previous group, grab towels.
text: Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but
text: Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her
text: at the tile wall.
text: More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted
text: water pipe pokes out. Clearly at some point there was a
text: handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted
dialog: pipe.
text: PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of
text: blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems
text: to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system.
text: The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the
text: laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the
text: tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and now more
text: blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall.
text: Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is
text: the only one left in the showers. Panic. Shuts her
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (to self)
text: It isn't real. It isn't real.
text: Opens her eyes.
scene_heading: Five letters are written in blood. N-O-T-A-L.
text: Shaking, nauseous, she looks down at her feet and the
text: drain, too scared to look back up.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (to self)
dialog: It isn't real. You're
text: hallucinating.
text: Perhaps. But now blood drips by her ankle, DRIP, DRIP,
text: DRIP. And the shooting pain she feels is coming from her
text: arm. What the hell -- ? WE SEE SHARP SLASHES appearing
text: on her skin, like some invisible knife is slicing her.
text: Hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers --
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA
text: Miranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm, too freaked
text: out to process anything. Fumbles for her clothes and heads
text: straight to Shelley, tying her shoelaces, muttering.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Shelley?
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: And pick up those damn cigarette
dialog: butts. Jesus, TV is dumb --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Shelley, can you do me a favor??
text: Shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look.
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: The housewives will find something
dialog: better to do.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Can you go in the shower and tell
dialog: me if you see anything on the wall?
text: Shelley doesn't respond. Simply crosses over and heads
text: for the showers. Miranda gets dressed when a hand on her
text: shoulder makes her jump --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Enough privacy for you?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes. Thank you, Irene.
text: But now Irene notices the blood seeping through the
dialog: towel.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Nothing. It's nothing --
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What the hell did you do to
dialog: yourself?!
text: And now the other patients are curiously watching as
text: orderlies RUSH IN to haul her away.
scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER
text: THROUGH a glass pane we see a NURSE bandaging Miranda's
text: arm. Parsons and Irene confer just outside the room.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I looked away for a second. It's
dialog: unacceptable, won't happen again.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Not your fault. Patients always
dialog: find a way to hurt themselves if
dialog: that's what they want.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I just didn't peg her for a
dialog: cutter, that's all.
text: Parsons watches Miranda through the glass. She can't
text: look him in the eye.
scene_heading: INT. REC ROOM - LATER
text: Miranda (with her fresh new bandage) ignores the looks
text: from the other patients as she rejoins them. Spots
text: Shelley by the window furthest from the wardens. Scared.
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You saw it?
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Listen, Doctor. Some people, they
dialog: have a gift. And in here, because
dialog: they categorize us as a bunch of
dialog: schizos, they refuse to
dialog: acknowledge that. It's like that
text: Hubble telescope that sees things
dialog: a trillion miles away but what
dialog: it's seeing is just reflected
text: light of a star that died a
dialog: thousand years ago? It's like
dialog: that. Doesn't mean you're crazy.
dialog: It only means your eyes open in a
dialog: different way.
text: Miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation, but
text: has a sinking feeling.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What did it say?
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: On the telescope?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Did you see anything, Shelley?
text: Shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear.
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: That's not tile that wall is made
text: out of . It's a holographic
dialog: screen. All part of your mission,
dialog: isn't it?
text: Miranda shakes her head, feeling foolish. Walks away.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Thanks anyway.
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: (taps her forehead)
dialog: This is all we have. The rest is
dialog: dust.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY
text: Pete and Miranda stare at each other. A tense beat.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It was you I called that night.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Did you mention that to the cops?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I didn't think it would help you.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It means they wouldn't have let me
dialog: treat you if they thought I had
dialog: any kind of involvement in what
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And did you?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Did I what?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Did I make it to your place? Did
dialog: I see you that night?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: No. We got disconnected and I
dialog: couldn't get through to you. I
dialog: sat there waiting all night.
dialog: Figured you'd changed your mind.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why didn't you tell me this before?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Because the only way you'll be
dialog: able to accept these events is if
dialog: you remember them on your own. My
dialog: job is to assist you in processing
dialog: that information because you're
dialog: not in a frame of mind to do it by
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She stares at him. Queasy.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You're changing the subject.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: The subject is you don't trust me.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Right now I don't trust anyone.
text: She tries to read his face. Reminds herself of who Pete
text: is and what he means to her. He points at her bandaged
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You want to talk about today?
text: She takes a resigned breath, slowly shakes her head.
dialog: Wishing she could wake up from this nightmare:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I want to talk to my lawyer.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I think that's premature.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I can't help what you think.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE GARDEN - DAY
text: SPRINKLER SYSTEMS doing their thing: THWIP, THWIP,
text: THWIP... The female patients are out in the gardens for
text: their freshly dose of air. BOOM DOWN TO Miranda alone at
text: a bench. A cigarette appears before her, being offered
dialog: to her:
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: You a Marlboro girl?
text: Miranda sees Jenna looming above her, shielding the sun.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don't smoke, thanks.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: All we have is our health,
dialog: cupcake.
dialog: (sits beside her)
dialog: What I do is quit constantly,
dialog: start again. Drives them all
dialog: crazy. One day I quit three
dialog: times.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Huh.
text: Jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly.
text: Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna
text: rambles on.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: They allow me one match at a time
dialog: and pretend they're not watching.
dialog: Check it out: salivating goon
dialog: number one at three o'clock, oh-
dialog: so-inconspicuous goon number two
text: at five o'clock.
text: Miranda follows Jenna's gaze. Sure enough, she's being
text: closely watched by two orderlies.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What did you set on fire to wind
dialog: up here?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Very perceptive, Doc. I burnt
dialog: down the building where I worked.
dialog: I found a baby at the doorstep,
dialog: called the cops -- of course the
dialog: bottom feeding pricks never
dialog: showed. It's beside the point,
dialog: really.
text: Miranda shrugs. God knows what Jenna is talking about
text: but who is she to say? Once again, Miranda checks the
text: building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge. She
dialog: rises --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Phil.
text: He keeps walking. Headed to the parking lot beyond.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Phil!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He turns. His first instinct is to smile. But he checks
text: himself, reminding himself of her new status. Slips into
dialog: his best professional face:
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Hello, Miranda.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I wonder if I could talk to you.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Of course.
dialog: (checks his watch)
dialog: Well, actually, I'm about to...
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Your staff meeting's done and
dialog: Thursdays you don't schedule
text: sessions until the afternoon.
dialog: This will just take one minute.
dialog: Promise.
text: Impressive. She remembers his schedule perfectly.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: True.
dialog: (points)
dialog: But the Sheriff wants to ask me
dialog: some questions.
text: She follows his look to the parking lot where Sheriff

dialog: It's about Pete.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: What about him?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Perhaps he's not the most
dialog: qualified person to be treating
dialog: me.
text: His tone is fatherly yet direct.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Are you complaining about his
dialog: methods or are you referring to
dialog: the nature of your past
dialog: relationship with him?
text: This surprises her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What did he tell you?
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: He explained there might be a
dialog: conflict of interest because he
dialog: has feelings for you. You two
text: engaged in a kiss at one point.
dialog: Am I right?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: I told him we're all grownups here
dialog: and the fact is he's the best doctor
dialog: on my staff. As such, and given the
dialog: severity of the charges you face, I
dialog: consider him the most qualified person
dialog: to assist your recovery. Now, if
dialog: you'll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan is
dialog: not a patient man.
text: Stonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling
text: like an idiot. Watches Parsons join the Sheriff by his
text: car. The two men shake hands when suddenly Irene runs
text: past her, yelling --
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Hey! Chloe!
text: Now two ORDERLIES race past. Miranda looks over to see
text: what the fuss is all about. Chloe is on top of an
dialog: institute staff member we haven't seen before, a round
text: black woman named CONSUELO. Punching her --
text: Other patients have crowded around the scuffle.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You fucking cow giving me the evil
dialog: eye, huh? Fuck you, you fuckin'
dialog: voodoo witch -- !
text: Irene and the orderlies yank Chloe off Consuelo. Chloe kicks
text: and screams like an animal. Consuelo meekly stands up.
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: (heavy Cuban accent)
dialog: Is okay, she's okay -- she don't
dialog: mean nothing.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You bet your goddamn fat ass I
dialog: mean it, you're a witch -- !!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: McGrath, that's enough!
text: The orderlies start pulling Chloe away. Chloe spits at
text: Consuelo, full of venom.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Take your voodoo shit back to
dialog: Cuba --
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: I said that's enough.
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: Irene, she's okay. Pobrecita, la
dialog: infeliz. It's a misunderstanding.
dialog: Pobrecita. I was only trying to
dialog: help her --
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You wanna help me? You pity me?
dialog: (grabbing her
dialog: crotch)
dialog: Suck me.
text: The orderlies haul Chloe off. Irene disperses the crowd.
text: Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her
text: manner says she just wants to get back to her duties.
text: Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they
dialog: were doing.
text: Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something
text: catches her eye: Pete watching her from his office
text: window. He quickly slides the curtain shut. Odd.

scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR
text: SLOW PUSH DOWN empty corridors. The air thick with dread --
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT
text: Miranda cries softly, unable to sleep. VOICES trickle in
text: from the corridor outside, wardens on their rounds, a
text: SOFT MOAN from another cell, a random SCREAM. She shuts
text: her eyes, repositions herself on her stomach.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: FADE OUT.

speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: How are we feeling today?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: 'We'?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Sorry I asked.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Doesn't seem like the best choice
dialog: of words when treating
dialog: schizophrenics.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: Fitting right in, aren't you?
text: The library is pretty much empty at this hour except for
text: the LIBRARIAN and the odd janitor tidying up. An
text: efficient-looking man rises from a desk, briefcase in
dialog: place, glass of water -- this is attorney THEODORE
text: "TEDDY" HOWARD.
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: Miranda.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hi.
text: Irene checks her watch. The warden hangs back, keeping
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: IRENE
text: She's due back in the rec room in
dialog: twenty, Counselor.
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: Thank you kindly.
text: Miranda sits. Waits until Irene is out of hearing range.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Teddy, I know you knew Doug well
dialog: and this is an extremely --
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: I'm here as your lawyer. So
dialog: whatever my relationship was with
text: Doug is no longer of consequence.
dialog: First things first, how are they
dialog: treating you?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Like I'm crazy.
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: You know this place better than
dialog: anyone. Anything out of the
dialog: ordinary?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Other than me being crazy? No.
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
text: The DA is pushing for a hearing as
dialog: soon as next week. They're eager
dialog: to resolve this situation because
dialog: -- well, crimes like this don't
dialog: happen that often around here.
dialog: Doug was a hometown boy who'd done
dialog: good, beloved high school
dialog: principal, a role model. Our best
dialog: shot -- scratch that, our only
dialog: shot -- is to claim temporary
dialog: insanity.
text: As he speaks, she starts fidgeting with her itchy
dialog: bandage.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Wait, wait, wait -- Teddy, you
dialog: know me. I wouldn't raise a hand
dialog: at my husband for the life of me.
dialog: Not even in self-defense. Isn't
dialog: it remotely possible a burglar
dialog: broke in or some crazed high
dialog: school student attacked Doug and I
dialog: went into shock?
text: Teddy shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You're telling me there's no other
dialog: suspects in anyone's mind?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: Frankly, no. Neighbors heard
dialog: screams. They have you at the
text: scene, they have the murder weapon
dialog: and they have your prints everywhere.
dialog: The only thing they don't have is
dialog: motive.
text: She keeps absently playing with the bandage. The
text: adhesive is giving. The bandage starting to peel off.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Because there is no motive.
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: And that's what's confusing them.
dialog: The fact that you're a brilliant
text: psychiatrist doesn't help either.
text: It fills their heads with ideas.
dialog: They figure if you were to plan a
dialog: murder you might know how to fake
dialog: insanity to get out of it.
text: She pulls off half the bandage, back and forth. Not
text: looking. BUT WE SEE the beginning of a pattern in her
dialog: scarred skin --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'm not faking anything.
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: Good. I pass no judgment either
dialog: way. The point is --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: The point is I'm the only person
dialog: who doesn't believe I killed my
dialog: husband. I never thought I'd say
dialog: this, but I feel like I'm in the
text: middle of a conspiracy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you believe I'm crazy?
text: An uncomfortable Teddy takes too long before answering.
text: Miranda looks down, humiliated -- and now she sees it.
text: Perfectly carved into her arm, her scar reads:
dialog: "NOT ALONE."
text: Petrified, Miranda jumps back, knocks down Teddy's glass
text: of water all over his papers, her chair topples over.
text: The warden and janitor look up --

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: It doesn't matter what I believe.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Forget it. Forget I asked.
text: PUSH INTO her face as involuntary tears roll down and we --
scene_heading: INT. PETE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Miranda. Numb. Pete trying hard to get through. A
text: beat. We get a good look at the writing on her arm.
dialog: (The right arm.)
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I can't help you if you don't talk
dialog: to me.
text: Silence from Miranda. He is firm but not unkind:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I can stand here all day. All
dialog: week. You're the one running out
dialog: of time.
text: Nothing. He goes to touch her arm. She jerks it away.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What does it mean?
text: She shakes her head, at a loss. Torn between her
text: suspicion and the need to confide in someone. Finally:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I didn't write this.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Then who?
text: They stare each other down. There's definitely chemistry
text: between these two. But the moment is far from romantic.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You're going to have to trust me.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Because no matter what's going
dialog: through your mind right now, I
dialog: haven't done anything wrong.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Then you know exactly how I feel.
text: He starts to speak, stops himself. Switches tactics.
text: Their banter escalates in speed as their terms get more
dialog: clinical:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You admit you're having a hard
dialog: time differentiating what's
dialog: reality from what's hallucination,
dialog: right? So isn't it at least
dialog: possible that --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: As a doctor I agree with you.
dialog: Maybe -- and this is a big maybe
dialog: -- all of this is just a deep
dialog: epilepsy that extends to the
dialog: limbic structures, but I'm telling
dialog: you --
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How about this moment right now?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Is this a hallucination?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You tell me. But I do know what I
dialog: sound like. Paranoia is the
dialog: ultimate awareness, right?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Which is why I suggest we simply
dialog: increase your dose until --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (venom)
dialog: No! Goddamnit! No!
text: He steps back at her blowout. She catches the look on
text: his face and forces herself to sit down.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'm sorry. Is there any way we
dialog: can pretend that didn't just
dialog: happen?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat; struggling)
dialog: I want to believe you. I do. So
dialog: I'll take your word for it --
dialog: you're not involved in this -- but
dialog: you take mine: I didn't write
dialog: this and I didn't kill my husband.
text: He studies her. Finally nods. New tactic:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Alright. Let's say you didn't
dialog: write this --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Number one: I'm right-handed.
dialog: Number two: I would have had to
text: bring an X-Acto knife into the
dialog: shower to do this, wouldn't I?
text: Pete tries to reserve judgment. Her argument has a
text: certain loopy logic to it. He hesitates, then pulls a
text: SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS from a manila envelope.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I think it's time you look at
dialog: these.
text: Miranda looks at the crime scene photos. Lurid.
dialog: Terrible. Here's part of Doug's body. Here's the axe.
text: And now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words
text: on it. In blood, a la Manson family. And it says:
dialog: "NOT ALONE."
text: Miranda immediately tosses it away from her. Repulsed --
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Miranda furiously writes on the wall with blood. Wipes
text: her face breathlessly, leaving a thick red streak on it.
scene_heading: INT. PETE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You wrote that. Any idea why?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (panic rising)
dialog: No, I didn't. No, I didn't!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Pete retrieves the photograph off the floor and holds it
dialog: up for her to study again.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You're the only person who can
dialog: figure out what this means. Try
dialog: to remember. Stop holding back.
text: She nods meekly. Staring at the picture. Begins to
text: shake as all of it finally comes flooding in --
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick
text: streak of blood on it. She looks down at Doug, crawling
text: on hands and knees. He moans horribly, in shock. She
text: grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. He
text: reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and
text: makes a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying
text: turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles.
text: Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands.
text: Doug's hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over
text: her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA.
text: Miranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in
text: the mirror over the mantel and stares --
text: WE HEAR THAT SOUND. The WETTISH GURGLING sound. Miranda
text: stares at the MIRROR looking for the source of it. For
text: an instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there,
text: beckoning. But now she's gone and Miranda is left
text: studying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE
text: around her. She looks down at her feet: No fire. Blood
text: on her clothes, axe still in her hands. Looks back up
dialog: at:
scene_heading: THE MIRROR VERSION OF MIRANDA
text: shows a serene expression on her face. Fire enveloping
text: her. She slowly lifts her hands over her head. In place
text: of the axe there are CHAINS attached to SHACKLES on her
text: wrists. She is completely naked, as if purified -- like
text: an extreme version of Anima Sola. (A Biblical icon in
text: which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate.)
text: Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment --
text: When the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and we're back to
text: reality. Miranda stares at the axe she's flung at it.
dialog: 45.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - LATER
text: Miranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink. This is
text: a daunting task, seeing as how she's covered in it. She
text: stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor, at
text: the marks on the door handle, towels and wall.
text: Gasping for breath, almost crying, she turns on the
text: shower at full blast and climbs into the tub. She
text: watches the blood wash off her. As if finally coming
text: back to her body and realizing what she's done, she
text: slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the
text: tub. Crying. Shaking. She shuts her eyes as hard as
dialog: she can to make it all go away, and we --
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
text: Silence. And now, faintly at first, but GROWING
text: PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER, we hear the SOUND OF BUZZING FLIES.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Miranda wakes up, still in the tub. How long has she
dialog: been there, hours? Days? Impossible to know.
text: But at some point she must have turned off the water.
text: She sits up, every muscle of her body aching, hair caked
dialog: with blood.
text: The first thing that hits her is the stench. And it's foul,
text: the putrid smell of decaying flesh. She steps gingerly out
text: of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of
text: blood, mortified at what she will find.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
dialog: Soon enough the press will make the Manson Family
text: reference, but for now, only Miranda is here to witness
text: the fruit of her labor. She gasps for air.
text: Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea. She doubles over
text: to throw up when there is a FRANTIC RAPPING at the front
dialog: door.
text: She freezes. VOICES and YELLS trickle in. The HINGES on
text: the door RATTLE under REPEATED POUNDING and she still
text: stands there as the first FIREMAN breaks in. Sheriff
text: Ryan and his deputies right behind. A concerned Pete
text: Graham behind them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The cops take one look at the place and raise their guns
text: at her, but we can't hear what they're saying because
text: Miranda's ragged BREATHING has taken over the soundtrack.
dialog: Suffice to say that, at the sight of the guns, something
text: clicks inside her and she turns on her heel and flees --
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: She slips on blood, nearly falls as she scrambles to the
dialog: bedroom --
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM
text: She locks the door behind her, hyperventilating in terror.
text: Instantly there are men POUNDING on it. SQUAWKING RADIOS.
text: ORDERS BARKED at her. She spots two officers through the
text: window in her backyard. About to smash the window.
text: A caged animal, completely surrounded, she covers her face
text: with her hands. Trembling. The doorknob jiggles violently,
text: about to give. And when she brings her hands down she is
text: staring straight into the teenage girl's face. And she
text: OPENS HER MOUTH WIDE and now we are back in --
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)
text: Miranda gasps for air, drowning in sensory overload.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Oh God, oh God, oh God...
text: She rocks back and forth. Finally aware of what she's
dialog: done. She is the killer. No more doubts. And now that
dialog: she knows, everything is much worse.
text: A long, harrowing beat.
text: WE PUSH IN ON her devastated face. NIGHT TURNS TO DAY.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY
text: The locks are unlocked. Pete appears at the door.
text: Miranda glances up at him. She looks like a different
text: person. Completely destroyed. He crouches beside her.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You okay?
text: She shakes her head slowly. He sets his hand on her
text: shoulder. She turns to him and hugs him tight, holding
text: on for dear life. Breaks down in sobs.
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: INT. PHIL PARSONS' OFFICE - DAY
text: Parsons leafs through Miranda's file. Pete stands by the
text: window, lost in thought.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: How much does she remember?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: It all came flooding back last
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Guilt?
speaker_heading: PETE
text: More like an uncontrollable
text: reminiscence. Intense, over-
text: cathected. She's not feeling
dialog: guilty of her actions, not
dialog: exactly. Sounds to me like last
dialog: night she actually re-lived them
text: in great detail.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
text: Hypermnesis following amnesia.
dialog: Could a specific epileptic element
dialog: be involved?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: That's exactly what she suggested.
dialog: Even in her present state, her
text: instincts remain impeccable.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: I'd like to talk to her.
scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER
text: Pete escorts a fragile Miranda down the corridor. The
text: two orderlies walking ominously behind them.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Standard procedure.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I didn't say a word.
scene_heading: INT. DR. PHIL PARSONS' OFFICE - DAY

dialog: Dorothy, I can't discuss this
dialog: now --
dialog: (motions for
dialog: them to sit)
dialog: I'm not taking it lightly, no. We
dialog: will talk about it at home.
text: Miranda and Pete sit across from him. Miranda trying
text: hard to appear composed -- acutely aware of her every
dialog: gesture, and of how different her last visit to this
dialog: office was. Nothing casual about it now.
text: She stares at the picture frames on Phil's desk (all
text: facing AWAY FROM us), the diplomas on the wall, the books
dialog: by noted fathers of neurology (works by Hughlings
dialog: Jackson, Kurt Goldstein, Henry Head, A.R. Luria). A
dialog: framed quote reads:
dialog: "'If You Do Know That Here Is One Hand, We'll Grant You
dialog: All The Rest.' -- Wittgenstein"
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes, dear. Me too.
text: He hangs up. Takes a moment to look at Miranda. Tries a
text: smile but to her it comes off condescending. Fact is --
dialog: there's nothing to smile about.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: I'm so sorry about this, Miranda.
text: She nods, dazed. Angles her head to look at a framed
text: picture on his desk. Parsons looks to Pete.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Has Pete told you about the
dialog: hearing?
speaker_heading: PETE
text: Teddy already filled her in.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Teddy Howard is top notch. He's
dialog: going to do everything in his power
dialog: -- and he's quite resourceful -- to
dialog: prove you're not fit to stand trial.
dialog: Miranda, I know you have no family
dialog: left, so we're your family now and
dialog: we're all going down to the wire to
dialog: protect you and help you in any way
dialog: we --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Who is that?
text: Parsons pauses here. Exchanges glances with Pete.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: The girl in the picture.
text: WE SEE what she is talking about: a framed photograph on
text: the desk is now FACING us. Eerie. It shows Parsons, his
dialog: wife Dorothy and a young girl. Our teenage girl.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: My daughter.
text: Miranda looks up at this, perplexed.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: She's the girl I saw.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: You're obviously mistaken.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'm positive. She was hurt,
dialog: bleeding. Is she all right?
text: Pete and Parsons trade uneasy looks.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Miranda, you've seen that
dialog: photograph at least a dozen times,
dialog: every time you've been in this
dialog: office. You're just confused --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Not about this. Is she all right?
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: No, she's not... all right.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Rachel committed suicide six years
dialog: ago.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Miranda, that's none of your --
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: That's okay.
dialog: (to Miranda)
dialog: Rachel was a very troubled girl.
dialog: Handicapped since birth. She was
dialog: born mute. My wife and I tried
dialog: everything to help her fit in
dialog: but... but she ran away from home
dialog: more than once, wanting to end her
dialog: life.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And she finally succeeded. Jumped
dialog: off Ashley Bridge. She was only
text: seventeen years old.
text: Ashley Bridge. Mute. Ghost? Miranda hesitates here.
dialog: She is not the type to believe in ghosts, and knows full
dialog: well what even her suggestion of it will sound like.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'm -- I'm terribly sorry, Phil.
text: Parsons doesn't want to talk about it anymore. Rises.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Peter, can I speak to you?
text: The men step outside. PUSH IN ON Miranda's face as she
text: stares at the picture of Rachel. We catch snippets of
text: the doctors' discussion outside, increasing her
dialog: paranoia --
speaker_heading: PETE (O.S.)
dialog: ... Textbook psychotic pattern...
dialog: manifestation of guilt...
speaker_heading: PARSONS (O.S.)
dialog: ... much she knows about Rachel?
speaker_heading: PETE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm telling you she doesn't...
dialog: Concocted alternate reality...
speaker_heading: PARSONS (O.S.)
dialog: I'm trusting you... crawling with
dialog: cops.
text: A DARK SHADOW envelops Miranda's confused face, as we --
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT
text: Miranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic
text: light. We are MOVING TOWARDS her, seeing her as if from
text: the POV of someone approaching her. We become aware of
text: the RAGGED BREATHING sound. Miranda opens her eyes,
text: looks this way and that, then closes them again.
text: She is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard
text: before. The strained WET SOUND. Miranda's eyes SNAP
text: OPEN. She slowly sits up, back against the wall.
text: Squinting to cover every inch of the room.
text: And now she sees it: a SHADOW crouched in the corner.
text: Roughly the size of a person. Miranda climbs off the bed
text: and slowly walks towards it. Scared, but determined.
text: She wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it.
text: She gets closer... closer... The RAGGED BREATHING GROWING
text: LOUDER as she reaches the shadow --
text: She stretches out her hand and finally touches...
text: NOTHING. She swipes her hand through the air, feeling
dialog: stupid.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: This is not going to work. I'm
dialog: sick of being watched, and I know
dialog: this place well and it doesn't
dialog: smell this bad.
text: She paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'm awake, I'm not dreaming. I'm
dialog: alive -- this is not some
dialog: afterlife mumbo jumbo. So-called
dialog: paranormal activity can be
dialog: debunked a million different ways.
dialog: So whatever you are, whatever it
dialog: is I'm making up here -- I'm
dialog: letting you go, I'm setting you
dialog: free. I'm the wrong person. And
dialog: I need to sleep. I'm not afraid
dialog: and I don't believe and I'm fully
dialog: aware that this is all in my mind
dialog: -- fiction -- a concocted
dialog: alternate reality -- and I
dialog: acknowledge it. And now I'm done
dialog: with it. I'm going to sleep now.
dialog: The moment is as brave as it is ridiculous. She has
text: psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost. And
text: now she climbs back in bed.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (sleepy)
dialog: Besides, if you really were the
dialog: ghost of Rachel Parsons, you would
dialog: let me out of this cell.
text: A beat. And now we hear the SOUND OF THE DEADBOLT SLIDE
text: OPEN. The door opens quietly. PUSH INTO Miranda's face.
text: Properly scared now.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Holy shit.
dialog: If proof is what she wanted, proof is what she got. From
dialog: now on we'll refer to the teenage girl as RACHEL.
scene_heading: INT. FEMALE WARD - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: Miranda takes a tentative step outside her cell, feeling
text: the door with her fingers, feeling along the wall --
text: still making sure she isn't dreaming this.
text: She looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of
text: neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily.
text: Nobody there. But when she looks down the other way she
text: sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. So
dialog: quick we're not sure we saw it for sure.
text: Miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction.
text: At night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling
text: quality. She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her
text: head at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells.
text: She turns to make sure Rachel isn't behind her and when
text: Miranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing
dialog: right across from:
scene_heading: THE NURSES' STATION
text: Where two nurses are watching TELEVISION. Miranda tiptoes
text: past them, ducking at the window to remain unseen.
scene_heading: ANOTHER CORRIDOR
text: This one is wider. Miranda is startled by the sudden
text: sound of LAUGHTER behind her. The nurses laughing at
text: their late night show. Momentarily distracted, she
text: almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall.
text: She holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a
scene_heading: SANITATION CLOSET.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She looks for something, a tool. Discards a pair of
text: brushes and finds a small screwdriver. Pockets it.
speaker_heading: THE STAIRS
text: Miranda hurries up the stairs, hugging the wall to stay
text: clear from the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA sweeping the area.
text: She waits at the landing, times it just right -- and
text: scurries to the next floor.
scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR (OFFICE FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: ACTION
text: Knowing her way around here, Miranda keeps a steady pace
text: as she heads towards her old office. She turns a corner
text: and stops in her tracks: another JANITOR making his
text: rounds. She waits until he's out of sight and rushes to
dialog: her office.
text: She pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the
text: lock. Starts unscrewing the screws. She does this as
dialog: fast as she can, but she's no professional -- so it takes
text: a few tries. She loosens one screw, then another -- and
text: clumsily drops the screwdriver. The METAL ECHOES against
dialog: the floor.
text: Miranda sucks her breath in, waits. No footsteps. She
text: bends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for
text: balance. It easily turns in her hand. It was open all
text: along. She simply forgot to check.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE
text: Miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her
text: computer. Shrouded in darkness. Hits a switch and a
text: SURVEILLANCE MONITOR comes to life. Now she has a view
text: of the corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a
text: smoke, a janitor at the coffee machine and so on.
text: She switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she
text: waits for it to boot up.
scene_heading: ON SURVEILLANCE MONITOR
text: The JANITOR with his coffee cup now heading back towards
dialog: Miranda's office corridor --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Miranda glances at the door, can see the glare of the
text: computer screen reflecting against the glass pane. She
text: tries opening drawers but they're all locked. She
text: remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath
text: the couch, uses it to block the light.
text: Computer powered up, she runs an online search for
text: "RACHEL PARSONS." Waits as the info appears --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (to self)
dialog: Alright. What happened to you?
scene_heading: ON COMPUTER SCREEN
dialog: Various listings: The archive news of her funeral,
text: something about her search and a LOCAL NEWS ARTICLE about
text: teen suicide. That's the one she chooses. Hits "PRINT."
text: She checks the surveillance monitor again: the janitor
text: now mops right outside her door.
speaker_heading: ON PRINTOUT
text: The heading says "WHAT DRIVES OUR TEENAGERS TO SUICIDE?"
text: A quick glimpse gives us ages (16, 18, 17) and names of
text: three local girls who have died. Rachel's name and
text: PHOTOGRAPH appears with two others: Jenny Dixon and
dialog: Andrea White.
text: Miranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance
text: monitor: the janitor is walking away. She watches him
text: disappear down the hall. Slowly but surely. And now the
text: screen is empty.
text: But just for a second. Because suddenly Rachel is there.
text: Staring straight at her. Makes us jump.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR/STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Retracing her steps, Miranda shuts her door and hits the
text: stairs. Playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera.
scene_heading: INT. FEMALE WARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: As she reaches the landing, she hears VOICES coming her
text: way. She detours down another corridor and hides from
text: view. Waits for Consuelo and a nurse to exit down the
dialog: staircase.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: And now she turns at ANOTHER SOUND. Coming from inside
text: the room immediately behind her. Room 237. She steps to
text: the small glass pane on the door and peers inside.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 237
text: It takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but
text: now we make out TWO FIGURES in the room involved in some
dialog: sort of struggle.
text: Miranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a
text: flash of metal. Something sharp. Not a knife, but a needle.
text: And now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm. In the dim
text: light we can make out Chloe, eyes glazed, drooling.
text: Just for a beat, because now she is slapped down on the
text: bed like a rag doll and the man with the needle ENTERS
speaker_heading: FRAME.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Miranda flinches, confused. Glances down the corridor to
text: ensure she remains undiscovered. Then peers back in.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 237
text: Chloe on her stomach on the bed. Her pale naked skin
text: marked with scratches and bruises. The needle is stuck
text: in her arm, which hangs off the side. Her mouth is open
text: but it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or
text: sobbing. Abruptly the man climbs on her, pulling off his
text: T-shirt.
text: As he discards it we see that it is yellow.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Disturbed, Miranda turns away. Except now the corridor
text: isn't empty. There is a JANITOR at the end. Coffee cup
text: in hand. Staring at her, disconcerted.
speaker_heading: JANITOR
dialog: Hey!
text: Miranda turns and runs.
scene_heading: INT. FEMALE WARD STAIRS
text: Miranda bolts down the stairs. THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS and
text: YELLS can be heard right behind her.
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: INT. FEMALE WARD THIRD FLOOR
text: Miranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency
text: exit door all the way at the end.
text: TWO ORDERLIES emerge from the staircase and give chase,
text: shouting for her to stop. PATIENTS holler from their
text: cells, awakened by the COMMOTION.
text: Miranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as
text: she gets closer and closer to the emergency door. Twenty
dialog: feet, fifteen, ten --
text: When a side door opens and a MAN IN A YELLOW SHIRT
text: appears, blocking her path. Miranda tries to avoid
text: crashing into him but carries too much momentum. Veers
text: left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and
text: pins her down.
text: The orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find
text: her screaming, hysterical. They hold her down --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It's him! It's him! Jesus
dialog: Christ, it's him!
text: The man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea
text: what she's talking about. Ho-hum, just another psychotic
text: woman trying to escape. A nurse prepares a needle and
dialog: we --
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
text: TRACKING ALONG a long desk where the staff finish their
text: morning meeting. Parsons, Pete and Irene among others.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: We've transferred her to a higher
text: security room on the fifth floor.
dialog: That's my final concession to any
dialog: type of special treatment.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: And the night staff?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: They insist her room was properly
dialog: locked, what else could they say?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Could there be any truth to her
dialog: claim?
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Peter, we have one hundred and
text: forty employees. Thirty-five work
text: maintenance. They all wear yellow
dialog: shirts, it's their uniform. I'm
dialog: holding a very discreet inquiry,
dialog: sure -- but I don't want a news
text: van parked outside day and night.
dialog: It makes much more sense that she
dialog: tried to escape and got caught,
dialog: doesn't it?
text: Pete ponders this. It certainly seems that way.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I perused Miranda's files on Chloe
dialog: McGrath -- they're damn
dialog: comprehensive. Maybe she was a
text: bit obsessed with her.
text: Irene and Parsons share a look. He wraps it up:
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: The scariest gift God gave us is
dialog: our minds. And a bright person
text: like Miranda -- she's grasping at
dialog: straws here -- who knows what her
text: brain is telling her, now that
text: it's snapped.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - DAY
text: A better room, in fact. This one has a view. Heavy bars
text: on the windows, but still. Miranda paces. Pete is
text: seated, observing her deteriorating state.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Did you live here when Rachel
dialog: killed herself?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Yes. As a matter of fact, I was
dialog: part of the search party that
dialog: found the body.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Phil must have been a wreck.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You can imagine. Actually, Phil
dialog: was in Houston undergoing triple
dialog: bypass surgery when it happened.
text: What was that? Miranda reacts to this.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And this is confirmed. There are
dialog: hospital records and so forth?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm sure there are. Can we get
dialog: back on track now?
text: Miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What about these other dates, was
dialog: Phil here when the other girls
dialog: went missing and found dead?
text: A disconcerted Pete looks at the article with the
text: pictures of Rachel and the others: Andrea White and
dialog: Jenny Dixon.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Where are you going with this?
dialog: First I'm a suspect in Doug's
dialog: death, now what, Phil Parsons
dialog: murdered his own daughter?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Rachel Parsons disappeared six
dialog: years ago. A week later she's a
dialog: suicide. Andrew White, four years
dialog: ago, same M.O., and Jenny Dixon,
dialog: two years ago. Don't you find
dialog: that unusual?
text: He regards her. Maybe Parsons is right: she's
text: desperately grasping at straws now. Skims the article:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What same M.O.? One jumped off a
dialog: bridge, one hung herself and one
dialog: crashed her car. Who gave you
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Not one left a suicide note. In
dialog: fact, how is anybody sure these
dialog: were suicides?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You heard Phil, his daughter had
dialog: tried several times before --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That's his story. I need to talk
dialog: to the reporter who wrote that.
dialog: Frank something.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Well, you can't.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I beg to differ. I know my
dialog: visitation rights.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You can't because... he died.
text: Miranda snaps to attention here.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You're telling me the one local
dialog: investigative reporter who connected
dialog: three highly-suspicious deaths, just
dialog: happens to have conveniently died?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Frank Albright was an eighty-year-
dialog: old retired sociology professor.
dialog: (re: the article)
dialog: This is a fluff piece about
dialog: teenage depression and the
dialog: breakdown of the nuclear family.
dialog: You can find one in any local
dialog: paper, anywhere, any other week!
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Don't be smug, Pete. That's one
dialog: thing you've never been. Rachel
dialog: is somehow connected to what I'm
dialog: going through. I don't know
dialog: how -- like you said, I'm not in a
dialog: frame of mind to process the
dialog: information without assistance.
dialog: So I'm asking you for assistance.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Listen to me. You are not well. I
dialog: had hoped once you remembered the
dialog: murder we could deal with your
dialog: feelings about it but these
dialog: fixations:
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PETE (CONT'D)
dialog: Rachel Parsons, Chloe McGrath --

dialog: the longer you --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I know this lecture like the back

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Good. Saves me the trouble.
text: Discussion over. He raps on the door. Triple-locks come
text: unlocked and an ORDERLY is there. Peter exits.
scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Peter hurries down the corridor, passing by a nurse. The
dialog: same one who bandaged Miranda earlier, so let's give her
text: a proper name: CLAIRE. She pushes her cart into the
dialog: elevator.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Claire and her cart emerge from the elevator and she
text: heads down the long corridor, reaches a door and unlocks
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM
text: TIGHT ON a row of drug-filled shelves. Claire parks her
text: cart and kicks off her shoes. Digs a pack of smokes out
text: of her stashed purse when a pair of hands grab her.
text: Claire squeaks until she sees her attacker: a stoner
text: type named SIMON. Deftly unbuttoning her uniform, hands
text: all over her. She means to resist but he's got such
text: boyish charm.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Get off me, you dog --
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Hell, don't go all bubbly with joy
dialog: or anything.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You can't be in here and you know
dialog: it. Nap in your car.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She finally twists herself out of his grasp. Points an
text: accusing finger, but she's grinning. Blushing, even.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Now get out before we get busted.
text: Properly reprimanded, Simon picks up his folded uniform
text: and prepares to leave, head hung low.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: You slay me, Claire. Honest.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Sure I do, Boy Scout.
text: He exits. She shakes her head, slips her uniform back
dialog: on.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Simon presses the button, waits. He checks inside his
text: folded uniform where we see several stolen vials of
text: sedatives. The doors begin to close when --
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Hold it, Simon!
text: He hides the loot behind his back, busted. She holds the
text: door open and tosses him his yellow shirt.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What do you think I am, laundry
dialog: service?
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Won't happen again, ma'am.
text: She turns and exits. The doors slide shut. Meet our
dialog: rapist.
scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD CAFETERIA - DAY
text: Bustling with activity. The room is divided into two: a
text: large main area where the patients eat, plus a second,
text: smaller upstairs area for the staff.
text: BOOM DOWN to find Miranda eating at a long table.
text: Shelley beside her, playing with her plastic fork. Jenna
text: taps an unlit cigarette. As usual, Irene keeps watch
dialog: nearby.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: ... She'd get high on glue and
dialog: make me help her try on my bras.
dialog: Is that the strangest shit you've
dialog: heard?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Heard stranger. But she's a case.
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: And she always put on a happy
dialog: face. Man, what an optometrist.
text: Optometrist? Miranda starts to correct her, but lets it
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: You narced her out, didn't you?
dialog: Boo-hoo. Bet you were a little
dialog: buzzed yourself.
text: Miranda's gaze strays from this, um, most compelling of
text: conversations and comes to rest on Chloe. Alone at
text: another table. Heavily sedated. A wreck.
text: Miranda rises and walks over. Shelley waits until she's
text: out of hearing range, leans in to Jenna --
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: All work, that woman. Work, work,
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: She's like an alcoholic. But with
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: What work?
speaker_heading: SHELLEY
dialog: Not safe to tell you. Wish I
dialog: could.
text: Jenna rolls her eyes, returns to her food.
speaker_heading: UPSTAIRS
text: Parsons watches intrigued as Miranda sits beside Chloe
text: and starts talking. From Parson's POV up above we can
text: see pretty much the entire dining area.
dialog: 63.
dialog: BACK TO MIRANDA
text: Trying to get Chloe's attention. But Chloe just stares
text: at her untouched food, glassy-eyed.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I saw what happened. I'm sorry.
dialog: No reaction.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Have you told anyone? Chloe?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Look, Chloe -- the person who did
dialog: this to you is not the devil. And
dialog: if you can identify him, I'll make
text: sure the motherfucker is arrested.
text: Now Chloe looks at her, like something finally registers.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Doctor, did you just say
dialog: 'motherfucker'?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Do you know his name? Maybe you
text: saw a nametag on his uniform?
dialog: Think.
text: Chloe simply stares. Finally shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Man, you must really hate me.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What? I don't hate you.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You hate me because now you're
dialog: just the same as me. You must
dialog: feel so embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don't hate you. And I don't
dialog: feel embarrassed.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: That's just a pat answer you have

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA

speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You know what happens next?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I get the distinct feeling you're
dialog: going to tell me.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
text: The shock wears off and the guilt
dialog: kicks in. And that guilt is the
dialog: real motherfucker. You'll be
dialog: watched 24/seven, because they're
dialog: afraid you'll kill yourself. Dr.
dialog: Graham will question every harmless
dialog: gesture, every innocent comment, ever
dialog: twitch you make and eventually -- and
dialog: it's a fucking tedious 'eventually'
dialog: -- you'll stop hating yourself for

scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT
text: Echoing an earlier scene, we are MOVING TOWARDS her --

dialog: something.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Leave me alone. Go away.
text: Just like a crazy person. She listens for any further
text: noise, hears none and shuts her eyes. Exhausted.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I've lost my fucking mind. Happy
dialog: now?
text: Silence. But now the BEDSPRINGS CREAK behind her and she
text: whips around and starts to scream as a big hand covers
text: her mouth. Her eyes open wide at the sight of Simon, in
text: his yellow shirt. He shoves her against the mattress and
text: presses his full weight against her. She lets out a
text: muffled scream as he uncaps a syringe with his teeth and
text: brings the plunger to her throat. Straight into her
text: jugular.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: This is gonna hurt you more than
dialog: it hurts me.
text: She flails and kicks desperately but he pins her down.
text: The BEDSPRINGS STRAIN violently and now he's straddling
text: her, squeezing the plunger into her throat. Her eyes
dialog: welling up:
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: I've always wanted to do a doctor.
text: She manages to free one hand and yanks the syringe from
text: her throat. It flies to the floor. He grins, enjoying
dialog: this:
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: The more you fight me, the harder
dialog: I get, pussycat -- so pretty
dialog: please, with sugar on top -- keep
dialog: still.
text: Simon paws at her clothes as she struggles to defend
text: herself. He finally slaps her free arm down. Presses
text: his knee against it, immobilizing her once more. Now he
text: produces another syringe from his pocket. Checks it.
text: Miranda shakes her head, pleading. A scream stuck in her
text: throat. But nobody can hear her.
text: Simon brings the syringe towards her when suddenly we
text: hear a LOUD CLANGING at the door. Shaking it off its
text: hinges.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Simon looks up, confused. Nobody is there. The split-
text: second distraction is all Miranda needs to shove him off
text: the bed. She fumbles for the discarded syringe and STABS
text: HIS CHEST WITH IT -- squeezes the plunger --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Take that, son of a bitch.
text: Simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body
text: goes limp. Miranda exhales, coming back to herself. A
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Rachel?
text: No response. Miranda grabs his keys, begins to undress
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: SECURITY CAMERA POV
text: shows a uniformed janitor calmly walking down the
text: corridor. PULL BACK to see we are in --
scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE BOOTH - NIGHT
text: A bank of monitors keep watch on the premises after dark.
text: TWO GUARDS play cards (Uno), bored to tears. A cursory
text: glance at the monitors produces no reaction. Certainly a
text: janitor walking down the corridor is no cause for alarm.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Dead quiet. CRICKETS CHIRP or whatever it is crickets
text: do. Miranda steadies her breathing, perusing rows of
text: unfamiliar cars. She clicks Simon's key-ring button
text: repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on and off.
scene_heading: INT. SIMON'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Miranda slips behind the wheel, STARTS the CAR. The RADIO
text: KICKS IN at EAR-DEAFENING VOLUME. She nearly drops dead.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODWARD GATE - NIGHT
text: The gate GUARD reads a magazine as Miranda's stolen car
text: approaches. The guard barely registers the driver in the

text: open the gate for him. It opens SLOWLY. S-l-o-w-l-y.
dialog: 67.
scene_heading: INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: Miranda, sweating, watches the receding image of the

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
text: She glances back, makes sure no one is following her.
text: Catches her own reflection in the rearview mirror: the
text: scared eyes, the haunted face. The new version of
dialog: herself.
text: She flips the RADIO dial: BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. BAD
text: COUNTRY. BAD DISCO. More BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. She finds

dialog: it play.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Now we are seeing her as if from the POV of someone
text: traveling alongside the car. Peering THROUGH the

text: glances over. Sees nothing but her own reflection.
text: Turns back forward.
text: We NOTICE the blue cigarette lighter key chain dangling
text: off the dashboard. Nothing but a long stretch of road
dialog: ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night. Miranda
text: parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house.
text: Steels herself, climbs out of the car and heads around
dialog: back.
text: She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted plant, takes a
text: deep breath and lets herself in through the back door.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE
text: POLICE CRIME-SCENE TAPE everywhere. She turns on the

dialog: Eerie as hell --
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - QUICK CUTS

text: She looks in the rearview mirror once more. Only this
text: time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes.
text: Rachel's. Inside the car.
text: Rachel's mouth opens unnaturally wide, revealing a gaping
text: abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet
text: sound. A threatening howl this time, pure venom.
text: Miranda covers her face, jerks the car. It does a 180
text: and slides to a halt in the middle of the street --
text: Facing the direction of her house again.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: Miranda jumps out, panicked. Glances around. Looks
text: inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath,
text: making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a
dialog: U-turn.
scene_heading: INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Miranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling
text: and turns UP the RADIO. GUNS the pedal. Freaked.
text: She's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No.
text: The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key
text: but suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and
text: notices the key is gone.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why are you doing this to me?
text: A dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more
text: startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the
text: middle of the street.
dialog: 69.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty
text: street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys.
text: We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The
text: moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the
text: glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda
text: jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened
text: by a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes.
text: She watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in
text: her throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the
text: pesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now.
text: BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround
text: the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS
text: fastened around the insulators of a thick power line.
text: From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys.
text: And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming
text: loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some
dialog: invisible force --
text: Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP
text: and turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE
text: WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings
text: straight towards the paralyzed Miranda --
text: She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle,
text: back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to
text: a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The
text: wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends
text: SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like
dialog: lightning.
text: A silent, sudden beat. That was as close as close gets.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (fighting tears)
dialog: What do you want from me?
text: No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing
text: over her shoulder, seemingly demented:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What is it you want me to do?!!
text: A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the
text: middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING
text: abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the
dialog: sound.
text: It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door
text: SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Clearly Rachel wants her back in the house.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I can't.
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Please, please don't make me go
dialog: back in there.
text: But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards
text: it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the
text: road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost
text: electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate
text: yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car.
scene_heading: INT. SIMON'S CAR
text: Miranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here.
dialog: She's never asked a ghost for permission before:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Bear with me, I'm just parking it
dialog: out of the way so it won't look
text: suspicious in the middle of the
dialog: road -- okay.
text: She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE
text: Miranda stands in her living room, staring at her
text: handiwork. Frozen with dread.
text: The blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains.
text: The upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk
text: outline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the
text: shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied
text: footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc.
text: The faded writing on the wall: "NOT ALONE."
text: Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's
dialog: supposed to be looking for.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (piecing it together)
dialog: Not alone. What happened to you
dialog: happened to other girls.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I understand. And I'm sorry. But
dialog: there is nothing I can do about it
dialog: now. It has nothing to do with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Not knowing what else to do, she turns to exit when the
text: TELEVISION SET suddenly COMES TO LIFE, making her jump.
text: The unmistakable MUSIC from some old WB cartoon at FULL
speaker_heading: BLAST.
text: She stares at the TV screen. Is there some sign here she
text: should be able to follow? She crosses to turn it off and
text: immediately doubles over in pain --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Shit.
text: She looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck
text: right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin.
text: Blood already seeping from the nasty cut --
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Miranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out
text: the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket. She
text: grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the
dialog: cut.
text: And now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears
dialog: the hollow WET SOUND we've come to associate with Rachel.
text: Inside the room with her --
text: Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror
text: move? We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds
text: perfectly still, listening. The SOUND now seems to have
text: STOPPED. A silent beat.
text: She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing
text: as the alcohol burns her skin. It looks painful.
text: And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes
text: her look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like
text: the night of the slaughter: flames all around her. Naked
text: arms raised. Wrists shackled. Anima Sola.
text: She stares. Mesmerized. The sound of FLAMES GROWING
speaker_heading: LOUDER.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. No. No...
text: Miranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the
text: image reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if
text: the two versions of her are literally walking towards
text: each other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces
text: mere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the
text: mirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Miranda stares at her fingertips. The tips are burnt.
text: The skin sizzles softly. 200 percent scientifically
text: impossible. And when she looks up at the mirror again --
text: the image is gone.
text: It is now deathly quiet. And what she finds herself
text: staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something
text: just behind her. A folded newspaper discarded in the far
text: corner of the room.
text: She turns to look at it now. It's opened to the REALTY
text: LISTINGS page. Doug must have left it there. She picks
text: it up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank-
text: repossessed property.
dialog: The address is in Willows Creek.
text: Her brain wires start clicking. This must be what Rachel
text: wanted her to see. She stares at it.
text: PUSH IN ON the picture as we --
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WILLOWS CREEK PROPERTY - DAWN
text: A "FOR SALE" sign still flapping in the wind. The first
text: few rays of light break through the dawn sky.
text: Miranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it
text: FILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out.
text: She studies the house before walking up the drive. We
text: watch her peek through windows and walk around back,
dialog: looking for something. What exactly, we don't know.
dialog: (Neither does she.)
text: She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes
text: her stare now on the barn. The one place he hasn't
dialog: looked.
scene_heading: INT. BARN
text: Dark, empty. The WIND outside causes the ALUMINUM SIDING
text: to FLAP NOISILY. It's slightly unnerving, but hey, it's
text: just the wind. Miranda covers the distance of the large
text: room, perplexed. There is something about this place.
text: Something she can't quite put her finger on. Beckoning
dialog: her.
text: With a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front
text: door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops
text: her. She moves to it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: And here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow
text: gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A
text: padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both
text: walls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy
text: padlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall
text: and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only
text: a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness
text: beyond, but can't see a thing.
text: Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides
text: herself into the claustrophobic slot.
text: She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face
text: brushes against something hanging in the air. She stops,
text: startled. It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light
dialog: bulb.
text: She tugs on it. And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow
text: to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of
text: her. She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY
text: CREAK. She peers into the pitch-black basement below.
text: Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs
dialog: down.
scene_heading: INT. SECRET BASEMENT
text: Miranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness.
text: Whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb
text: upstairs does not reach here. She feels around the wall
dialog: for a switch. Nothing.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (to self)
dialog: It's not shrink-appropriate to be
dialog: afraid of the dark, right?
text: Abruptly there's a sharp CLICK as she lights Simon's key-
text: chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast
text: space. Rats scurry for cover. It takes a second to orient
text: ourselves. Something metallic catches the lighter's
text: reflection way in back. Miranda walks towards it.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Hello?
text: She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on
text: the floor. She stops. Kneels down and in the dim half-
text: light we make out a backpack. She unzips it and rifles
text: through it (T-shirts, underwear, Walkman) until she finds
text: a wallet. Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next
text: to the ID: the picture belongs to a teenager named
scene_heading: "TRACY MARIE SEAVER."
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Is there anybody here? Hello?
text: The lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it
text: click off. When it comes back on we see she has wrapped
text: a ragged T-shirt around it for insulation.
text: Miranda steps deeper into the room. Up ahead, she can
text: make out the metallic thing that reflected light before.
text: It is a hook in the ceiling. And suspended from it are
text: several heavy chains.
text: Like a meat rack.
text: And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and
text: sees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down,
text: tied around the hands and ankles.
text: Medical training kicking in, Miranda quickly lowers the
text: girl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Go away! Fuck off!
text: (We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so
text: that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an
dialog: almost strobe-light effect:)
text: She checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's
dialog: adrenaline at full tilt --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
text: She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the
text: girl's pupils. Inspects them. Slaps her repeatedly,
text: clinically.
text: The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the
text: immediate surroundings: household tools strewn about;
text: wire cutters, pliers -- a pool of dried blood.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Wake up, Tracy, wake up --
text: Nothing. She unties the wires around the girl's ankles.
text: The skin swollen grotesquely around them. She shakes the
text: girl. Slowly coming to the realization that it's too
dialog: late.
dialog: 75.
scene_heading: EXT. BARN - LATER
text: Miranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and
text: throws up. The bright light outside blinding her
text: momentarily. Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to
dialog: register --
speaker_heading: THE PATROL CAR
text: parked in front of the house. A POLICE OFFICER
text: cautiously peering inside her stolen car. He looks up
text: and notices her.
text: Miranda hesitates. Nowhere to run. The officer waves.
text: His name is TURLINGTON.
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: Howdy there.
text: He says this while already strolling over. Miranda's
dialog: mind races a mile a minute --
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: Everything okay?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Y-yes.
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: That your vehicle, ma'am?
text: She stares at the young, friendly cop. His left hand
text: resting on his belt. Right next to his gun. But it
text: seems as if he has no idea who she is. At least not yet.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes -- I -- I just pulled over. I
dialog: was -- looking for a bathroom.
dialog: Morning sickness, you know...
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: Congratulations. But I'm afraid
dialog: this is private property -- you
dialog: can't just waltz on in. You
dialog: understand that.
text: She nods, nerves shot to hell. Starts walking.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'll be on my merry way now. My
dialog: husband will never forgive me if I
dialog: get a ticket for trespassing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of
text: marital dynamics. He flashes a smile but suddenly stops,
text: whips out his gun and trains it on her --
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: Holy shit.
dialog: (clicks the safety
dialog: off)
dialog: Lady, stay right where you are.
text: Miranda shuts her eyes, busted. Freezes.
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
text: Hands up where I can see them.
text: Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands.
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
text: Nice and slow, start talking to
dialog: me. And make it good. Tell me
dialog: just exactly who that is.
text: A confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction he's
text: looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door. Dragging
text: herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock.
text: Battered, yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive.
dialog: But just barely.
scene_heading: EXT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY
text: A car pulls up to the chaotic ER area. Phil Parsons and
text: Pete step out, rush inside.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ER - MEN'S ROOM - DAY
text: Sheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal. But even here he
text: can't find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his
dialog: case --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Mr. Howard -- let me simply list
dialog: the events your client was
dialog: involved in last night. First she
text: drugs a janitor, steals his car
dialog: and escapes a mental
dialog: institution --
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: Hold on, there isn't even any
dialog: substantial evidence --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Sheriff Ryan zips up his pants, flushes and runs the sink
dialog: to wash his hands --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Mr. Howard -- there isn't evidence
dialog: because the overdosed janitor
dialog: hasn't woken up, that's why -- and
dialog: when your client was questioned on
dialog: the matter she admitted to
text: injecting a full syringe of --
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: (handing him a
dialog: paper towel)
dialog: You had no right to question my
dialog: client without my presence --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Mr. Howard, this is not a courtroom.
dialog: Your client was read her rights and
dialog: she still insisted --
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: -- Let me ask you this, Sheriff:
dialog: what exactly was a janitor doing
text: with several vials of sedatives
dialog: inside my client's cell? And is
dialog: it not possible he had taken some
dialog: drugs himself before my client --
text: Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to
text: the waiting room, Teddy following closely --
scene_heading: INT. ER WAITING ROOM
text: Paramedics and nurses doing their thing. The young
text: officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of
dialog: coffee.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: I'm not a drug expert. I'm simply
text: stating the frigging facts.
text: Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee, notices
text: Parsons and Pete approaching. Relief crosses his face.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Phil, thank God -- this guy's
dialog: driving me nuts!
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: An 'incident' -- for lack of a
dialog: better frigging word -- involving
text: Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's
dialog: been tortured and is in critical
dialog: condition and chances are slim
dialog: she'll even utter another word.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Who's the girl?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
text: A runaway from Portland, Tracy
dialog: Marie Seaver. Reported missing a
dialog: couple weeks ago. We found Miss
text: Grey in some barn off Willows
dialog: Creek with the girl all messed up.
dialog: I'm just now waiting for the
dialog: surgeon to give me an update.
dialog: (to Teddy)
dialog: Notice, Counselor, how I'm not
dialog: even mentioning her trespassing or
text: lying to a police officer.
text: Teddy waves him off in frustration. Goes to talk to
text: Turlington.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Christ, the woman's got the entire
dialog: hospital busy --
text: Sheriff Ryan notices Teddy talking to Turlington --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Why are you harassing my deputies?
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: I'm only asking him where he got
dialog: the coffee -- ?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: He's not at liberty to answer
dialog: that. You've had enough goddamn
dialog: coffee already.
text: The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons. They walk over to
text: the water cooler where they can talk more privately.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We need to get Miranda back to the
dialog: institute. She needs psychiatric
dialog: care, not a prison cell.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Parsons nods, lost in thought. Sheriff Ryan returns.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Phil, how well does your wife know
dialog: the suspect?
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Why do you ask?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Because she's at the station right
text: now, demanding to speak with her.
text: Parsons frowns at this, concerned. Pete studies him.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTY STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY
text: Bare room. A desk and two chairs. Glass window panes to
text: insure no privacy. DOROTHY PARSONS (50s) waits, seated.
text: The door opens and a DEPUTY escorts Miranda in. She sits
text: across from Dorothy, looking as lost as can be. A long
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: How are you?
text: Miranda doesn't answer. Her mind elsewhere. Namely back
text: at the barn and how it connects to Rachel.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I needed to see you, but I'm not
dialog: sure where to begin. I don't know
dialog: you well, I certainly have nothing
dialog: but fond feelings for you. Phil
dialog: always keeps me posted on his
dialog: colleagues and his work and -- in
dialog: any case, I have always thought of
dialog: you as a very bright, very
dialog: perceptive doctor. Even though I
dialog: don't know you well.
text: She pauses here. Miranda looks up now. Her face hollow
text: and exhausted. Bags under her eyes. A person who has
text: seen too much. Wondering where the hell this is going.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: My point is, my point being --
dialog: when Rachel died I had, um, I
dialog: suffered through these spells,
dialog: these recurring dreams.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DOROTHY (CONT'D)
dialog: And eventually, once I came to
dialog: terms with her death, they went
text: away. Losing a child is the
dialog: hardest, most inconceivable event
dialog: a mother can --
text: She drifts off. Takes a beat to collect herself and
dialog: resume:
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: The past few days I have been
text: having the same dream. A
dialog: nightmare.
text: Miranda can't help but smile to herself at that.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That word. Nightmare. Welcome to
dialog: my life.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: This nightmare involves Rachel but
dialog: it also involves you. In the
text: nightmare Rachel holds a box in
text: her left hand. A small box. And
text: she repeats a series of numbers.
dialog: Now, Rachel never spoke, from the
dialog: time she was born -- she had a
dialog: condition -- I often asked God why
dialog: he punished this child in such a
dialog: way -- she couldn't speak, but she
dialog: was extremely bright. She wasn't
dialog: autistic as the doctors claimed --
text: Dorothy Parsons starts to cry. A moment passes like
text: this. It seems she won't recover enough to continue her
dialog: tale.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Mrs. Parsons, you need a
dialog: therapist. Normally I would
dialog: encourage you to schedule a
dialog: session with me but as you can
dialog: see --
text: Dorothy shakes her head, determined to finish. She pulls
text: out a folded piece of paper.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Every night the same box in her
dialog: hand and the same numbers. I
dialog: wrote them down.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She slides the paper over. Miranda watches her
text: carefully, then looks at the piece of paper. The numbers
dialog: are:
dialog: 1-0-2-2-0-1.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
text: It's a message. It's a code for
dialog: something. I don't know what.
dialog: But she wants you to have it.
dialog: Miranda studies it. Studies this woman, who quite
text: frankly seems to have completely lost her mind. Then she
text: looks back at the numbers and is slowly hit with a
dialog: realization.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: October 22nd, 2001. It's my
dialog: wedding date.
text: She stares at Dorothy, stunned. Brain click-click-
text: clicking. Her wildest fears confirmed: Doug is behind
dialog: this somehow.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That code belongs to a safety
dialog: deposit box my husband kept in a
dialog: bank up in Newcastle, that's where
dialog: his parents live.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Dorothy, I need you to drive up
dialog: there and open it.
text: Dorothy stares at her, scared. And finally nods.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY
text: Pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as
text: TWO POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Miranda is brought out of
text: one of the cruisers by two OFFICERS.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We can take those off now.
text: Sheriff Ryan leans out of the other cruiser.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Don't push it, Doctor. She's
dialog: cuffed until your people secure

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Pete sighs, gestures for the officers to bring her in.

text: approaches.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I was wrong. It wasn't Phil
dialog: Parsons. It was Doug.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Can we talk about this later?
dialog: (to Sheriff)
dialog: Thanks, Sheriff.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Tomorrow morning first thing my
dialog: deputies are here.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I know, I know. We'll see you
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: And my offer still stands if you
dialog: need added security.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Thank you. She won't go anywhere.
dialog: I guarantee it.
text: The Sheriff waves, whatever. Knocks twice on the hood
text: and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That's why Rachel picked me. It
dialog: was Doug. I'm so stupid.
text: Pete regards her now, has no idea what she's going on
text: about this time. Tries to remain professional.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Inside, okay?
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER
text: Lunch time for the female wing. An excited Shelley

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A moment later, Miranda walks in with her police escort.
text: Taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door.
text: An uneasy Pete leads. Irene and the wardens at the rear.
text: Miranda glances at the women staring at her like a
text: specimen. Like somehow she's even more dangerous than
dialog: them. Top dog, as it were, of the crazies.
text: And then, halfway across the room, one of the women
text: stands up. Chloe. She claps her hands together.
text: Slowly. Miranda watches her, confused. And slowly
text: Shelly, Jenna and others rise as well. All of them
text: joining Chloe in clapping.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: She's a hero. Little Red Riding
dialog: Hood put the big bad wolf in a
dialog: coma.

speaker_heading: OFFICER #1
dialog: They're not gonna start something,
dialog: are they?
text: Irene shakes her head, amused.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: You ain't scared of a bunch of
dialog: women now, are you, Officer?
text: The entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their
text: solidarity for Miranda. Chloe locks eyes with her,
text: mouths the words "thank you."
text: And Miranda is hauled out the side door.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL
text: White. Surveillance cameras in every corner. Two

dialog: well.
speaker_heading: ORDERLY #1

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I pulled a lot of strings to get
dialog: you transferred back. The best
dialog: case scenario you're looking at
dialog: right now is five years here.
dialog: Five. Under my --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Peter, I didn't believe in ghosts
dialog: before this. And neither do you.
text: Pete is at the end of his rope. Can't hide his sadness
text: when he looks at her. Still, he tries to get her back on
dialog: track:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: But you know that the brain is
dialog: fully capable of tricking you into
dialog: seeing all sorts of things. The
dialog: simplest chemical deficiencies
dialog: can --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Chemical deficiencies can't get
dialog: inside of you and make you do
dialog: terrible things you don't remember
dialog: doing!
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'm a very open-minded person, but
dialog: as a doctor --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No, you're not. You're a close-
dialog: minded academic, just like me.
dialog: You told me once that I was the
dialog: most logical person you knew,
dialog: remember? Well, everything that's
dialog: happened has an explanation but it
dialog: has nothing to do with psychiatry
dialog: or science. Rachel Parsons was
dialog: abducted and she was murdered six
dialog: years ago -- tossed off the Ashley
dialog: Bridge by my husband. My
dialog: harmless, righteous 'community
dialog: leader' husband -- that's how
dialog: pathetically blind I've been.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (CONT'D)
dialog: Andrea White and Jenny Dixon were
dialog: also abducted and murdered -- now
dialog: this was before I met Doug but I
dialog: bet you anything that they both
dialog: went to his school. Then he
dialog: obviously stopped for a while:
dialog: fear, guilt, distractions --
dialog: namely me -- delayed him from
dialog: reverting to his sickness. That's
dialog: why I didn't notice anything. I
dialog: believe he really tried to lead a
dialog: normal life, for me. Then along
dialog: comes Tracy Seaver and he can't
text: resist. Locks her up and tortures
dialog: her in some abandoned property --
text: She shows him the crumpled newspaper listing.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Here's Doug's interest in real
dialog: estate, Pete.
text: Pete stares at the realty listing for Willows Creek.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Rachel Parsons is a pissed-off
text: ghost with an agenda, furious at
dialog: her parents for giving up on
dialog: her -- she's been trying to
dialog: communicate with them for years
dialog: but they're too goddamn logical to
dialog: pay attention -- and she picked
dialog: me, she sought me out that night
dialog: and sent me home to fix her
dialog: problem. Made sure I killed Doug
dialog: because he was going to do the
dialog: same thing to Tracy Seaver as he
dialog: did to her. And she will get rid
text: of anyone who stands in her way.
text: Pete takes all of this in. Dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Is that a threat?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: To whom?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: To me.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: To you? I'm telling you she
dialog: nearly electrocuted me when I
dialog: tried to leave town and she led me
dialog: to that barn and if I don't do
dialog: what she wants -- she's going to
dialog: kill me.
text: Pete can see that she's petrified. He starts to speak,
text: but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his
text: lips. The gesture is tender, almost romantic. A
text: reminder of their very real connection.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I need you to at least consider
dialog: the possibility that I'm not
dialog: insane.
dialog: (beat; pleading)
dialog: Not as a doctor. As the only
dialog: person I trust in this world.

speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I'm not doing it for Miranda, I'm
dialog: doing this for Rachel.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: You're making a complete fool of
dialog: yourself. Do you realize what you
dialog: sound like?
text: She sighs, climbs out of the car, leaving him there.
text: Takes three steps. Stops. Turns back around and lets
dialog: him have it:
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: What do I sound like, Phil? Like
dialog: one of your patients? Well, it's
dialog: probably because that's exactly
dialog: how you treat me. And I've had
dialog: enough of this deafening silence
dialog: between us, this exemplary
text: mourning in front of the
dialog: community, tiptoeing around our
dialog: lives with you pretending Rachel
dialog: never existed.
text: BANK CUSTOMERS walk around the argument, pretending not
text: to hear. Phil is mortified. But Dorothy doesn't care:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: I'm losing my mind. Our daughter
dialog: is gone and I miss her and I'm
dialog: angry.
text: She turns and storms off. Phil takes it all in for the
text: first time. A moment later he climbs out of the car.
scene_heading: INT. BANK VAULT - DAY
text: A solemn GUARD places the safety deposit box on the table
text: in the middle of the room. Steps back through the gate
text: and waits. Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a
dialog: moment.
text: Finally, Phil punches in the code written out by his wife
text: and opens it. He sorts through some paperwork that means
text: nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope. He
text: opens it and spills the contents on the table.
text: It is a stack of POLAROIDS.
text: Dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens. She
text: grabs onto the table, shakily -- and is forced to sit
text: down. A horrified sob rises from deep inside her, comes
text: out like the howl of a dying animal. Her husband pales,
text: all blood draining from his face.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - EVENING

dialog: night.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL
text: Miranda looks up at the sound of the BOLT BEING DRAWN and

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: How are we doing today?
text: That term again, "we." Doctor-speak. Miranda doesn't
dialog: have the energy for it:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Just fine, thank you.
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: The spirit is not fine. She's
text: very unhappy.
dialog: What was that? Normally Miranda would look at this woman
text: as if she were crazy, but things have changed.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: How -- how do you know?
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: (shuts her eyes)
dialog: But she's only a girl. Do you
dialog: know her name?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes. Rachel.
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: Have you talked to her?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes, I -- you could say that.
text: Consuelo holds Miranda's hands firmly, "reading" her.
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: She's very, very angry. And she's
dialog: not finished with you yet.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I'm sure that's meant to sound
dialog: comforting but --
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: She wants to show you something.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That may be so, but I want her to

speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: Then you need to protect yourself.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA

dialog: you --

dialog: Like this --
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Look --
dialog: (reading nametag)
dialog: Consuelo, I appreciate what you're
dialog: trying to do, but I honestly don't
dialog: think this ghost will go away if I
dialog: pour some egg powder on myself --
text: Consuelo holds up a finger, hushing Miranda. She's
dialog: receiving something here. Shudders.
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: She made you do things. Bad
dialog: things, didn't she?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: And you carried this out for her.
dialog: She used you as a vessel...
text: Consuelo's grip tightens on Miranda as we --
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASHBACK - EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: We're back at the bridge. Rachel pries open Miranda's
text: mouth. Miranda panics:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What are you doing? I'm trying to
dialog: help you -- ?!
text: Rachel opens her mouth wide like a snake. And as Miranda
text: screams, blood starts leaking out of Rachel's wounds.
text: And now we see it. Rachel's lips touch Miranda's and
text: BREATHE HER SPIRIT INTO Miranda with a WHOOSH --
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)
text: Consuelo lets go of Miranda's hand. Like recoiling from
dialog: fire. Speaks in the simplest of ways. The truth:
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: You were possessed by her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: Ay, probrecita. You're both in
dialog: terrible danger. She's scared too
text: but she can't step back into the
text: light until she finishes what she
dialog: started here. And now you're the
dialog: only person who can help her find
dialog: the way back.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don't know how to do that -- I'm
dialog: not qualified for it. You do it.
text: Consuelo crosses herself. A sign of respect for the
text: situation. But it has a chilling effect on Miranda.
speaker_heading: CONSUELO
dialog: Despair is the only unforgivable
dialog: sin. You'll be in my prayers,
dialog: Miranda.
text: Prayers? What good is that going to do? Consuelo exits.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: And young Rachel Parsons.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: This proves that her story is

speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Come on, Phil, you of all
dialog: people --
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: I of all people hold logic, reason
dialog: and facts above everything else.
dialog: And seek the truth through proof
dialog: and proof only.
dialog: (re: pictures)
dialog: And what do you call that?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Has it occurred to you that maybe
dialog: she knew what her husband was
dialog: doing to those girls?
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: No. Frankly, it hasn't.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Maybe she couldn't stand the guilt
dialog: and cooked up this far-fetched
dialog: tale to tug at everybody's
text: heartstrings. The fact remains
text: she hacked her husband to pieces.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: The fact remains my daughter was
dialog: murdered and Miranda stopped the
dialog: killer. A killer who was loose
dialog: under your incompetent nose for
dialog: over six years. We don't know how
dialog: many future victims were spared,
dialog: but we do know she saved that girl
dialog: in the barn's life. And that's
dialog: more than you or I can say -- !
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN

speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, you want to stand up in a

dialog: ghost is behind all this, that's
dialog: your prerogative -- but I have to
dialog: abide by the law. And the law
dialog: says Miranda Grey faces criminal
dialog: chargers. So here's what we're
dialog: going to do. I'm going to leave a
dialog: cruiser outside to make sure you
dialog: don't go anywhere tonight and two
dialog: of my deputies will go guard Ms.
text: Grey until tomorrow morning.
dialog: Phil?
text: Parsons doesn't respond. His eyes far away.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: There will be no breakouts, no
dialog: aiding and abetting, no taking the
dialog: law into your own hands. It'll
dialog: take an Act of God for Miranda
dialog: Grey not to show up in that
dialog: courtroom tomorrow. Are we clear?
text: And now the Sheriff can see that Parsons is crying.
text: Quietly, miserably. And it's a disparaging sight.
text: Sheriff Ryan exits. Two deputies follow, RADIOS
text: SQUAWKING.
text: Parsons remains still for a moment, then digs a
text: photograph out of a drawer. A picture of Rachel in
dialog: happier times.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: I'm sorry. I will never forgive

dialog: 93.
scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD SURVEILLANCE BOOTH

text: TWO OFFICERS stand there. We recognize one of them:
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: We're here on Miranda Grey detail.

speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: Sixth floor. You can get a couple

dialog: A pretty decent cup of joe too.
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: Thanks, guys.

speaker_heading: GUARD #1

speaker_heading: GUARD #1

scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL

scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - STAIRS - SAME TIME
text: The two cops use their flashlights to hustle up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME
text: Miranda holds her breath, listens. And sure enough,

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No. No. What do you want -- ?
text: And now LIGHTNING streaks the room and we see Rachel in
text: the corner. Staring with her dead eyes. Moving towards
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I've done everything you've asked
dialog: me to. My life is ruined. I
dialog: can't take this anymore. I
dialog: can't...
dialog: (faintly)
dialog: You have to step into the light,

scene_heading: INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - CORRIDOR
text: The cops arrive to find every door in the corridor flung

speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Sheriff? I have Miss Grey right

scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Page Irene ASAP. This patient
dialog: needs her meds.
text: Turlington nods. Miranda looks down at a grateful
text: Shelley, whose head is cradled in her lap. Brushes the

speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Are you alright, Miranda?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What's going on, Officer?
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: One of your patients is holding

text: Pete glances at Miranda. She knows exactly who it is:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA

speaker_heading: PARSONS

speaker_heading: CHLOE

speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Nobody better fucking move up
dialog: there or I'll blow this piggy's
dialog: head off!
text: Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM searches the section. Catches the

speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: That means you, fucko. Up on your

text: A beat. Officer Turlington rises. Slow and deliberate.

speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You have to let him go. I'm sorry.

speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: Look -- let's not confuse things.
dialog: I like you. But this is my only
dialog: chance.

speaker_heading: MIRANDA

dialog: his uniform and walk out of here?
dialog: Think about it, Chloe. They know

speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: What are my options? To grow old
dialog: in this place? It's clear they will
dialog: never let me go. Never. Ever.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA

dialog: than a year left here.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: That's a lie! I'll never stop
dialog: being sick, they'll just find

dialog: know you, Chloe, you've been
dialog: through things that most people
dialog: don't survive. And you have a
dialog: wonderful future in front of you
dialog: if you choose it. It's up to you.
text: This gets through to Chloe. Her grip loosens on the gun.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No more guilt, no more hatred, no
dialog: more unbearable sadness. You have
dialog: no use for any of that anymore.
dialog: Your life begins this very second.
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: I'm so tired. So goddamn tired --
text: Miranda walks over and embraces her. Chloe hands her the
dialog: gun.
text: And that's when the power returns.
text: Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace. Sheriff Ryan
text: on his knees. In the sudden, shocking glare of returning
text: light, color abruptly re-enters the world and every
text: RADIO, PHONE, FAN and MACHINE that were left on HUM TO
speaker_heading: LIFE.
text: Miranda finds herself staring at Sheriff Ryan, bathed in
text: the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the
text: cruisers outside. The image a replica of the Andrea
text: White and Jenny Dixon visions.
text: Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning
text: of a chest TATTOO. Miranda slowly trains the gun on the
text: Sheriff, finally struck with the realization:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: It was you, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup-
text: style WOMAN SURROUNDED BY FLAMES, ARMS RAISED, SHACKLED.
text: Anima Sola. Miranda's recurring vision from the night of
dialog: the slaughter.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: 'Not alone.' That's what Rachel
dialog: has been trying to tell me all
dialog: along. Doug was not alone. You
dialog: were with him. This whole time
dialog: it's been you. You covered up
dialog: their deaths to look like
dialog: suicides.
text: The Sheriff throws his jacket on, starts walking --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: You've lost your mind.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Don't fucking move.
text: The CLICK! of a SAFETY being released makes him pause.
text: He turns to look at her. A tense beat.
speaker_heading: PETE (O.S.)
dialog: Miranda, don't do it!
text: She glances at Pete's pleading face and the room around
text: her: cops everywhere. All guns trained on her.
text: Sheriff Ryan speaks low so only she can hear the
dialog: following:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: And just exactly who would believe
dialog: you? No proof, no living witness.
dialog: Everybody knows you're crazy.
text: Miranda's finger itches on the trigger as they face off.
text: Her hand starts to shake. Sheriff Ryan turns and strides
dialog: off. Getting away. Further. Further...
text: But as much as she wants to, she can't bring herself to
text: do it. Finally brings the gun down. The armed policemen
text: rush over and disarm her, shove her to the floor and cuff
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: I want that woman in custody. She
text: has a judge to face in the morning.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT (HEAVY RAIN)
text: Turlington escorts a cuffed Miranda to a waiting cruiser.
text: He jumps behind the wheel and starts to pull out when
text: Pete suddenly taps on Miranda's window, startling her --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'll call your lawyer and -- !
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: Sir, not now --
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I'll meet you at the station!
text: She shakes her head. Mouths something Pete can't make out.
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: Sir, please --
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: What?
text: Turlington hits the gas. Miranda presses her face
text: against the window so only Pete can see her say the
dialog: following:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: The girl in the hospital.
text: Pete locks eyes with her, nods -- as the cruiser leaves.
scene_heading: INT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - RECOVERING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Tracy Seaver lies unconscious, hooked up to a series of
text: machines. PULL BACK to find Pete with a young DOCTOR.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: Her condition remains the same.
dialog: Basically that ventilator is
dialog: keeping her alive. We have no
dialog: reason to think she'll ever wake
dialog: up. I'm sorry.
text: Pete nods, disconcerted. Stares at the girl.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: You mind if I stay here tonight?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Hey, it's a big place. The more
dialog: the merrier. If I can just ask
dialog: you to wait outside.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING AREA
text: The Doctor gestures for Pete to make himself comfortable.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HOSPITAL LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)
dialog: Dr. Brooks to ER. Dr. Brooks --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: That's me. Excuse me.
text: The Doctor rushes off.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY ROOM #2
text: Like Tracy Seaver, Simon Reynolds is hooked up to a bunch
text: of machines and cables. Suddenly his EYES SHOOT OPEN and
scene_heading: the CARDIAC ALARM SQUEALS --
text: Two NURSES rush in. The young Doctor right behind.
speaker_heading: NURSE #1
dialog: V-tach.
text: The EKG whipsaws. The Doctor feels for a pulse, then slaps
text: on the defibrillator pads, places the paddles on the chest --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Clear!
text: He begins chest compressions on Simon's heart. He spasms
text: violently once, twice -- And then it stops. The Doctor
text: and Nurses stare at the monitor. Flatline.
text: Unseen by them, Rachel steps out of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: WE SEE Turlington and two other COPS climb in a patrol
text: car and drive off. WE MOVE INSIDE the empty station...
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF RYAN'S OFFICE
text: Sheriff Ryan takes a healthy chug from a fifth of Scotch,
text: slips it back in a drawer. Stares at his hands. Steady as
text: a rock. Takes a deep breath. Knows what he must do next.
text: A religious man despite everything, he brings his thumb
text: to his forehead and crosses himself.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTY STATION - HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Miranda's eyes snap open at the SOUND OF DEADBOLTS
text: SLIDING UNLOCKED. Hopeful. Could this be Rachel?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A looming figure appears at the door. Doesn't bother to
text: shut it. Stares at her silently for a long while. And
text: so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: How did you know?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You tell me.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: This isn't one of your word
dialog: association games, Doctor. Did
dialog: Douglas tell you that night?
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Why wait this long if he had?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Maybe it's your amnesia. Maybe
dialog: you blocked it out.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Maybe. But it seems to me that
dialog: it's vital you know for sure.
text: He studies her. Takes a step towards her. Miranda
text: responds by stepping back. A slow motion semicircle, if
text: you will. She eyes the open door. Tempted.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: You think me and Doug are
dialog: monsters. That this was all a
dialog: carefully laid out plan with those
dialog: girls. But it wasn't that at all.
dialog: You do things sometimes and you're
dialog: not sure why you did them. Then
dialog: you realize you can live with them
dialog: and so can everyone else. Life
text: goes on.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: If you're looking for forgiveness,
dialog: you came to the wrong place.
text: She's stalling, trying to keep him talking and he knows
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: One thing about fear is it makes
dialog: people say the dumbest things.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Be that as it may, you're afraid
dialog: too -- because you know killing me
dialog: won't solve your problems.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: My only problem is you.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: What about Parsons? And Peter?
dialog: They know. And that girl in the
dialog: hospital will never forget your
dialog: face. You miscalculated, now you
dialog: pay.
text: Patience tested, he suddenly WHACKS her across the face.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: I hate a bad bluffer.
text: She makes a big effort to hide how much that stung.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I sure hope that felt good because
dialog: you can't afford too many more
dialog: signs of struggle. Can you?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Go ahead, hit me back. It's what
dialog: you want.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: No, that's what you want me to do.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Back to profiling, huh? Your
dialog: thought process is completely
dialog: transparent.
text: And now Miranda briefly takes the reins of the
text: conversation. Analyst and patient in session. Echoing
text: her opening scene with Chloe.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: So we're even. You left that door
dialog: open so I'd try and run, it's what
dialog: you get off on, isn't it?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: I guess we'll find out.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: And yet you have to make me look
dialog: like a suicide. With what, your
dialog: belt?
dialog: (off his shrug)
dialog: How would I get access to a belt?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Trust me, prisoners hang themselves
dialog: with just about anything.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: I don't think that's going to
dialog: satisfy you. You won't be able to
dialog: do this clean. You have too much
dialog: guilt inside.
text: SMACK! Another slap across the face. Miranda's knees
text: buckle. But she remains standing. Her lip trembles.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: You're losing grasp of the
dialog: situation. It was different with
dialog: those girls. I bet all they did
text: was cry and scream.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Don't worry, you'll scream.
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Take off your shirt.
text: This throws her off. She shoots a quick glance at the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: Aren't I a little old for you?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Take it off.
text: She hesitates. He draws his gun, tired. Removes the
dialog: safety.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: That's for show. You know you
dialog: can't shoot me.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: But I can smash your teeth out and
dialog: make it look like you bashed your
text: head against the wall. Now shut
dialog: up, take off your goddamn shirt
dialog: and pull off your bra.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Miranda is petrified now. Running out of ways to hide
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Today, Doctor.
text: In a sudden move, Miranda shoves the chair at him and
text: bolts out the door. The Sheriff doesn't move to stop
dialog: her.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Miranda dashes down the hallway, trying to escape. Takes
text: quick inventory of the space: two more holding cells
text: like her own, a row of filing cabinets, and a storage
text: area with barred windows. She makes a turn up ahead and
text: reaches another gate down the corridor. A sliding gate
text: that closes off the cell area from the main station.
text: She tries the gate. Locked, naturally. She shakes and
text: bangs on it, desperate.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: TURLINGTON!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!
text: No response. And no way to disguise the sheer panic in
text: her voice. She fell for his trap. They're all alone
dialog: here.
scene_heading: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - SAME TIME
text: Ryan smiles at that. Re-holsters his weapon and walks
text: towards her, taking his time. Relishing the hunt.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Doug mentioned you were painfully
dialog: 'modest.' But enough about you,
dialog: let's discuss Rachel.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Now Miranda searches for a place to hide. His FOOTSTEPS
scene_heading: GETTING CLOSER --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN (O.S.)
dialog: She was no crippled saint. Wasn't
dialog: the first time she turned up at
dialog: Doug's house all messed up.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Sheriff Ryan peeks down the corridor where we last saw
text: Miranda. The gate still locked. She's not there. He
text: traces her steps, clearly enjoying this:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Sure she was a minor, but she
dialog: wasn't going to let that get in
dialog: her way.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE AREA - SAME TIME
text: Miranda is cramped underneath an upturned desk. The SHOT
text: is FRAMED so we can see the doorway. She prays silently:
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Rachel, where are you when I need
dialog: you?
text: Clearly not here. Sheriff Ryan's voice getting closer:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN (O.S.)
dialog: Those other girls -- make no
dialog: mistake -- they knew what they
dialog: were getting into.
text: He appears at the doorway now, peeks inside the room.
text: Sensing her in there. Miranda holds her breath.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: I'm not saying they knew they were
dialog: going to die, but truth is, Doug and
dialog: I didn't know it was going to end that
dialog: way. It was just the natural extension
dialog: of that moment. So yeah, we fucked
dialog: them and we killed them. And we knew
dialog: it was wrong. Sure we did.
text: He reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a
text: CLANGING SOUND. Miranda wasn't underneath that one. She
text: scrambles to the door behind him as he turns --
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: She slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to
text: slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly
text: SMASHES OPEN against her, knocking her backwards onto the
dialog: floor --
text: He looms over her. She reaches around for anything to
dialog: defend herself. Nothing there. Game over --
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: It wasn't some satanic pact,
dialog: society didn't make us do it. But
dialog: I believe given the proper
dialog: circumstances a person is capable
dialog: of anything -- certainly in my
dialog: line of work you see it day in,
dialog: day out.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Tell you what, keep the shirt.
dialog: The bra will do.
text: Miranda stares, helpless. The Sheriff gestures for her
text: to begin. Like he has all the time in the world.
text: Miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra
text: under her shirt. Petrified --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Chin up, Doctor. You wanted to
dialog: get to the bottom of this and you
dialog: did. You followed it all the way
dialog: through. This is how it ends.
text: His demeanor and voice are eerily calm, as if in a
text: trance. He takes the bra from her hand and hangs it
text: around her neck, as if helping somebody with their tie.
text: She takes a step back and finds herself pinned against
dialog: the wall --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Doug settled down once you two got
dialog: married. New start and all that.
dialog: Wanted nothing to do with this
dialog: runaway I'd found, Tracy Seaver --
text: He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking
text: her. She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole
text: body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking
dialog: uncontrollably --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Or so he claimed. Because the
dialog: truth, Doc -- is people never
dialog: change. The son of a bitch
dialog: couldn't resist. I asked him to
dialog: dump the body and instead he went
dialog: found some barn to work her out of
dialog: his system some more. Go fucking
dialog: figure.
text: And now we PAN DOWN TO see Miranda's left hand ever so
text: slowly reach for his holster...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: You can't count on anyone, even
dialog: friends you've had your whole
dialog: life.
text: They're so close together their noses nearly touch. He
text: gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her. He
text: applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin
dialog: to the point of no return --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: The only soul you can ever count
dialog: on is yourself --
text: BLAM! A GUNSHOT rings out and half his ear explodes in a
text: gush of blood. He stumbles back, still on his feet,
text: dazed.
text: He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him.
text: Struggling to catch her breath. A faint smile forms on
text: his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: Why, Doctor. That was unexpected.
text: He steps forward, almost playfully. She slowly shakes
text: her head. Wraps her fingers tightly around the
dialog: trigger --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: You sure about this?
text: He stares at her. Blood flowing from the side of his
text: head. He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's
text: open cell, weighing his options at triple speed --
speaker_heading: SHERIFF RYAN
dialog: You need me alive for your story
dialog: to stick. Be logical now. You
dialog: know you can't kill me.
text: He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills
text: a BULLET through his forehead. Sheriff Ryan splays
text: backwards and lands with a crash.
speaker_heading: MIRANDA
text: Logic is overrated.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The door to Tracy's room is closed. WE FIND Pete where
text: we left him, by the soda machine, fighting to stay awake.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: MOVING TOWARD him, we COME TO REST ON the back of his
text: neck. So TIGHT we can actually see the hairs on the back
text: of his neck. And as he feels the SWOOSH of a cold
text: whisper, they stand up on their ends.
text: Pete turns to Tracy's room to notice that the door is now
text: open. Strange. He stands up and walks to the door.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY ROOM #1
text: Pete looks oddly around the room.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Anybody in here -- ?
text: As he turns, we REVEAL Rachel slipping out of the room.
text: Unseen by him, of course. Pete starts to exit when Tracy
text: opens her eyes. Groggily waking as if from a dream.
speaker_heading: TRACY SEAVER
dialog: Hello -- ?
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTY POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: Turlington comes out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of

text: Turlington raps on the Sheriff's door and opens it.
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: Sheriff Ryan?
text: No sight of the man. That's odd. Maybe he's in the
text: bathroom. Turlington heads in that direction.
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Turlington peeks in. checks the stalls.
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: Sheriff?

text: parking lot for a moment before shutting it.
dialog: 113.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR
text: The FRONT DESK OFFICER is trying to hold back a grim Pete,
text: Parsons and Teddy Howard from heading to the back area.
scene_heading: FRONT DESK OFFICER
dialog: I'm sorry, but nobody is allowed
dialog: to visit at this hour --
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Is the Sheriff here or isn't he?
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON

dialog: Help you, gentlemen?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We're here to see Miranda Grey.
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: You know full well you're not

text: Teddy Howard slaps an official-looking document on him.
speaker_heading: TEDDY HOWARD
dialog: That's straight from Judge
dialog: Wilkinson. Take us to her cell.
scene_heading: FRONT DESK OFFICER
dialog: Better get the Sheriff out here.
text: Turlington looks over the paperwork, confused.
scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
text: Sheriff Ryan isn't here. His car
text: is gone too.
speaker_heading: PARSONS
dialog: Officer, unlock the goddamn door
dialog: to Miranda's cell or I'll break it
dialog: down myself.
text: Turlington is not used to being spoken to this way,
dialog: certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric
text: institutes. He leads the men down the corridor and
text: unlocks the cell. The men wait as all three locks are
text: dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open.
text: The men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks.
scene_heading: INT. HOLDING CELL

scene_heading: OFFICER TURLINGTON
dialog: Jesus H. Christ.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY

speaker_heading: CHLOE

speaker_heading: PETE

text: Stops midway, turns:
speaker_heading: CHLOE
dialog: You don't have to tell me if you
dialog: don't want to, but -- have you
dialog: ever heard anything from -- ?

scene_heading: INSERT - POSTCARD
speaker_heading: MIRANDA (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Pete. Hope this finds you on
dialog: both feet, preferably having been

dialog: competition, but a big hug to you
dialog: anyway... I was as surprised as
dialog: anyone to read about Sheriff

scene_heading: EXT. BLEEKER STREET (NYC) - DAY

speaker_heading: MIRANDA (V.O.)
dialog: P.S. And in case you're wondering
dialog: what the chances are of me buying
dialog: you a beer and maybe finishing
dialog: something we almost started, the
