text: FADE IN... on a man in a floating hell. We are:
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (2 A.M.)
text: An enclosed, fiberglass LIFEBOAT, 28 feet long - with 60
text: seats, and HATCHES fore and aft. It's steamy, hot, even at
text: night. Floating on the Indian Ocean, 300 miles from Somalia.
text: RICHARD PHILLIPS sleeps upright in this sweatbox, at
text: gunpoint. He's 50, a career merchant mariner - now a hostage.
text: His captors are four Somali pirates: BILAL is 16, his left
text: foot wrapped in bloody gauze. ELMI is 25, has a three-colored *
text: ROPE on his lap. NAJEE is 24. They're asleep too. But:
text: MUSI, their leader, is wide awake. 25 years old, 5'9", maybe
text: 135 pounds. A rail-thin killer. His hand, bandaged and
text: bloody, holds an AK-47 as he studies the sleeping Phillips.
text: After a beat, Musi rises, and "undogs" (opens) the AFT HATCH,
text: stepping out onto the lifeboat's tiny AFT DECK. He lays his
text: AK at his feet, and pees off the edge.
text: Phillips' eyes instantly snap open. Turns out, he was awake. *
text: He assesses his options - IMAGES, hitting us in a hurry:
text: Three pirates asleep; the THREE-COLORED ROPE on Elmi's lap;
text: Musi's back turned to us; the AK on the deck... and SIX FULL
text: FUEL BUCKETS, tied down in the boat's nose. It's time to go.
text: So he rises, heads for the aft hatch. The rest is a blur:
scene_heading: EXT. LIFEBOAT - AFT HATCH/AFT DECK - CONTINUING
text: The craft is orange, shaped like a submarine. Musi pees off *
text: its deck, the AK at his feet. Phillips can grab it and fire
text: away. He considers that.
dialog: *
text: But a half-mile away, lit up like a distant jewel, is a US
scene_heading: NAVY GUIDED MISSILE DESTROYER - the USS Bainbridge. 508 feet
dialog: long. Immense, powerful, here to rescue him - so...
text: He pushes Musi off the deck and dives in. We FOLLOW: *
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WATER —- CONTINUING - NIGHT
text: His glasses fly off, gone forever in the cool water. He
text: starts swimming madly, moonlight shining through. Behind him,
dialog: *
text: Musi surfaces, howling in Somali at his crew. *
text: Next Phillips hears the engine of the lifeboat roaring to *
text: life. He swims, kicks, gasps... then he looks back. Oh no: *
text: The lifeboat is coming at him, Musi clinging to its side. *
text: Phillips sucks in air, and DIVES down. Even underwater he can *
text: hear the pirates shouting. The lifeboat passes over him, then *
text: STOPS, idling right atop him. Phillips can touch its hull. *
text: He surfaces beneath the bow - a quiet breath - grabs the *
text: ENGINE COOLING PIPES under the keel and guides himself along. *
text: FOOTSTEPS on the deck above him. Pirates howling, enraged. He *
text: ducks under the boat again, comes up on the port side.
text: But waiting there, in the water, is Musi. Oh shit.
text: They lunge for each other's throats instantly. Hand-to-hand
text: combat, just like that. Phillips gets Musi's head under
text: water, Musi's scream turning into a burble of air.
text: Holding the guy down - Musi flailing, kicking - Phillips
text: trying to drown the bastard, until... another nightmare: *
text: POP POP POP. Three rounds from the AK, whistling past his ear
text: into the water. He looks up.
text: Elmi, on deck. Firing. It's over. Phillips releases Musi.
text: That fast, Phillips is yanked out of the water by Elmi and
text: Bilal, thrown through that aft hatch and back inside, where:
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT —- CONTINUING
text: Elmi and Bilal throw him to the floor of the boat. Then they
text: pounce: beating the hell out of him. Najee jumps in too. Shot
text: after shot, swarming like angry bees.
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: We kill you! Kill you!
text: Shouting, spitting, kicking. Elmi ties Phillips' hands to a
text: horizontal bar, exposing his torso. Bilal trusses Phillips'
text: feet to the base of a seat. He's helpless, a punching bag.
text: .+-as Musi, wet and enraged now, steps up. Silence... Then:
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: How much you worth, Irish? One
dialog: million? Two million?
text: CRACK. A right cross to Phillips' jaw, staggering him. Now *
text: the others join in again: pounding, spitting, shouting... *
text: .».-until, gradually, they stop - too winded to continue. *
speaker_heading: MUSI (CONT'D)
dialog: You stay tied now, like an animal.
dialog: And you pee in a bottle.
text: Phillips is a bruised, bleeding mess. Gasping...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I can't feel my hands. You trussed
dialog: ‘em too tight.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Like an animal!
text: Phillips tries to chew the ropes. Musi hits him again.
speaker_heading: MUSI (CONT'D)
dialog: Ropes can't touch your mouth! They
dialog: are halal!
text: He walks away. Najee and Elmi follow... leaving Bilal, the
text: youngest, to stand guard, AK in hand. Bilal studies Phillips,
text: perplexed. A long quiet beat... then he has to ask:
speaker_heading: BILAL
dialog: Why you didn't just shoot us?
dialog: (Phillips is silent)
dialog: Gun was right there. Why you don't
dialog: just grab it and shoot us?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I just... wanted to go home.
text: Bilal doesn't respond. He can't. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - STARBOARD - AMIDSHIP - NIGHT
text: The MAERSK ALABAMA is a cargo ship: 508 feet long, 83 feet
text: abeam, displacing 31,000 tons of water. Massive. With a seven-
text: story superstructure, "The House", rising from her stern.
text: She idles, a_mile from the lifeboat... as she is boarded by
text: U.S. NAVY SAILORS - guys climbing up flexible-steel ladders
text: from two NAVY ZODIACS idling beside the Maersk amidship.
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - SAME
text: SHANE MURPHY stands at the helm of the Maersk, 120 feet above
dialog: the waterline. He's Chief Mate on this ship - 27, tough as a
text: bouncer but with a Boy Scout face. From Seekon, Mass.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
text: The leader has a knife wound on his
text: right hand, pretty deep. Another guy,
dialog: he was the youngest, his foot's cut
text: up - from glass shards.
scene_heading: Murphy and 10 OTHER MAERSK CREW-MEMBERS (we'll meet them
text: soon) are being debriefed by LT. PRICE, USN.
text: ...as Navy SAILORS take control of this ship. An ENSIGN named
text: REID at the helm. Murphy can see the Bainbridge from here...
dialog: and that tiny orange fiberglass lifeboat. This sucks...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURPHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there some rescue planned? You
dialog: guys gonna get him outta there?
scene_heading: LT. PRICE
dialog: Orders are, no offensive measures
text: until the FBI Negotiator is on sight
text: and in contact with the pirates.
speaker_heading: ENSIGN REID
dialog: We okay to come about, Lieutenant?
scene_heading: LT. PRICE
dialog: Yeah. Come about.
text: Reid turns the wheel. The giant cargo ship turns. Murphy
text: sighs; none of the crew-members look happy. Chief Engineer
text: MIKE PERRY, (55, devout Christian) voices it:
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Doesn't feel right, leaving him out
dialog: there.
scene_heading: LT. PRICE
dialog: Command wants this vessel out of
dialog: hostile waters - we're escorting you
dialog: all the way to Mobassa.
text: The men hate that. Murphy studies them... then:
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Can we at least get word to his wife?
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERHILL VT. - RIVER ROAD - PHILLIPS' DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: FOUR NEWSVANS and 15 REPORTERS crowd the snowy driveway and
text: street outside the home of Richard and Andrea Phillips.
text: Underhill Vermont is a town with no stop-lights. But today
dialog: it's the center of the world, and Phillips is the reason. A
text: REPORTER, his breath fogged, does a remote from the porch.
text: ...as we PUSH INSIDE, through a window, to:
scene_heading: INT. PHILLIPS' HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING
text: An 1830's design, timber ceilings. Messy and warm. But what
text: used to be a calm home is now Mission Control: NEIGHBORS,
text: FAMILY MEMBERS - manning phones, monitoring CNN, fretting.

dialog: %
speaker_heading: + eH
dialog: *
dialog: *
text: We KEEP PUSHING THROUGH - faces, voices, a spilled soda - to:
scene_heading: EXT. PHILLIPS' HOME - BACK PATIO - DAY
text: A stone patio, dusted by light snow. ANDREA PHILLIPS sits out
text: here, a brief moment of solitude amidst crisis. Behind her we
text: see a perfect Vermont pasture, blanketed white.
dialog: Andrea is the one all those reporters want to talk to. The
text: wife. Lovely, fierce... but desperate just now. She stares at
text: an old NAUTICAL BELL that hangs over a clothes-line.
text: Through the patio doors she sees her SISTERS, her SISTERS-IN-
text: LAW, NEIGHBORS. All here to help. But none of them can.
text: On her face, fear. Sadness. She lifts a CELL-PHONE to her
text: ear, hits speed-dial. FOUR RINGS... then she hears:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (OUTGOING MESSAGE)
dialog: You know the spiel. Now do the deal.
dialog: I'll call you back.
text: BEEP. Andrea starts crying. About to hang up... Instead:
speaker_heading: ANDREA (INTO CELL)
dialog: Hi, Honey. You're gonna have a bunch
dialog: of hang-ups on this number. Sorry,
dialog: they're all me; it's the only way I
dialog: can hear your voice. Dumb, right?
dialog: Richard, I keep thinking about the
dialog: airport. Dropping you off like that.
dialog: I always walk you in and watch the
dialog: plane take off. Always. So why didn't
dialog: I this time? I don't know.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: The kids are good. They're both on
dialog: their way home. Everybody's calling,
dialog: even people we never talk to, guys I
dialog: dated thirty years ago. I think they
dialog: think I'm now available.
dialog: (half a laugh, then:)
dialog: Keep looking for me, Honey. Every
dialog: night in the stars. I'm up there. And
dialog: I'm looking for you. So I'll see you
dialog: soon, right? I love you.
text: She shuts the phone, eyes that old SHIP'S BELL overhead.
speaker_heading: ANDREA (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn it!
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT —- MOVING —- RESUMING (NIGHT)
text: This lifeboat chugs along, airless and fetid.
text: Phillips, bound now, his face beaten and bruised, silently
text: prays. Musi, on the bridge, watches, amused.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Hey Phillips, you turning Catholic
dialog: again?
text: (NOTE: the bridge is two steps above the lifeboat floor, with
text: nav and radio gear, two seats, and tiny cockpit windows.)
text: The pirates look strained, edgy; Elmi nervously works that
text: three-colored ROPE: weaving strands of white, orange, and red
text: into a whole. Phillips watches with an unspoken dread.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I have to urinate.
dialog: (mo one replies)
dialog: I need the bottle. I have to urinate.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: No bottle.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You just said...
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: You pee on yourself, like an animal.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Won't be too clean.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: I'm clean. My men are clean. No
dialog: bottle.
text: Two Captains, eyeing one another. The pirates watching...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: None of us are gonna get out of here
dialog: alive. You know that.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Why? 'Cause of Navy? Don't worry,
dialog: Irish. They not gonna hurt me. I work
dialog: for those guys.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Oh yeah. This is a training mission.
dialog: We take ships, see how the Navy does.
dialog: Your company hired us. Navy guys and
dialog: me, we're friends!
text: Crazy bastard. He points at the Bainbridge, brightly lit, a
text: half mile away, then chuckles. Phillips studies him...
speaker_heading: MUSI (CONT'D)
dialog: We offer them beer! No American say
dialog: no to beer! Beer and tv. Lazy, lazy.
dialog: We're Somali Marines, we're 24/7. We
dialog: can do anything.
text: Najee picks up the three-colored rope, consults with Elmi
text: about it in Somali. Clearly, it has great meaning to them.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: That's for me. Isn't it.
dialog: (Musi grins)
dialog: The rope. Is it for me?
text: Musi looks to his men: Do I tell him? A beat, then...
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Yah, it's for you, Irish. But you
dialog: can't touch it. Your hands are lalil.
dialog: Unclean.
dialog: (relishing this)
dialog: It's what we tie you up with before
dialog: we kill you. So your soul never
dialog: leaves these waters.
text: Phillips digests that. Musi grins, pleased.
speaker_heading: MUSI (CONT'D)
dialog: You had to pee, right? So pee! Pee,
dialog: Irish!
text: The pirates laugh. Phillips eyes them, defiant. You will not
dialog: break me...
text: And he begins to pee, darkening his pants.
text: The pirates start WHOOPING, celebrating, as:
scene_heading: EXT. PHILLIPS' HOME - BACK PATIO - RESUMING
dialog: Andrea remains alone out here... until:
speaker_heading: AMBER (0.S.)
dialog: Andrea?
text: AMBER, Andrea's oldest friend, stepping on to the patio.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: Who's been calling?
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Matt Lauer, Katie Couric, Diane
dialog: Sawyer, Senator Kennedy, Senator
dialog: Leahy. But we didn't want to
dialog: interrupt you...
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: You could've interrupted me for Matt
dialog: Lauer.
text: Amber breathes out a smile, then drops a bomb:
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Honey, there are two people from
dialog: Maersk here.
text: Andrea sees them now, through the patio door: two CORPORATE
text: TYPES, a man and_a woman, just got here. Standing out like
text: sore thumbs in a room full of friends and family.
text: She tightens. Maybe they're here to deliver bad news. Amber
text: seems to think so too. She leads Andrea into:
scene_heading: INT. PHILLIPS' HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING
text: The room is suddenly silent, all eyes on the suits: ALLISON
text: McCALL (blonde, pretty, likes her BlackBerry) and JONATHAN
text: HENSON (35, solid). They approach Andrea, who gulps...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Hi, Andrea. I'm Allison McCall. This
dialog: is Jonathan Henson. We're from
dialog: Maersk.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: Okay.
text: Bracing herself. Everyone in the room doing the same...
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I'm going to be managing anything
dialog: media-related for you. Jonathan's
dialog: going to be liaising with the Defense
dialog: Department, so you'll be getting
text: steady and real-time information.
dialog: Okay. She's not here to deliver devastating news. Everyone
text: relaxes. A sister-in-law, NANCY, extends a phone as:
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: Um. I have the Governor on the phone.
dialog: He wants to know if there's anything
dialog: he can do.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Yes. He can send over some State
dialog: Troopers to move all the reporters
dialog: off the road out there. They're
text: causing a traffic hazard.
dialog: Nancy pauses. Am I actually supposed to say that?
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: I'll be with him in a second, Nancy.
text: Nancy nods, relieved. Andrea studies Allison, wary.
speaker_heading: ANDREA (CONT'D)
dialog: I appreciate your being here,
dialog: Allison. But it's really not
dialog: necessary. I know how things go.
dialog: Maersk got their ship back, and all
text: of their cargo, and most of the crew.
dialog: That's a pretty good result. And
dialog: sometimes one man gets sacrificed for
dialog: the good of others. That's the sea.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Mrs. Phillips, Maersk is not going to
dialog: let anything happen to your husband.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: I see. Then how much are they willing
dialog: to spend to save him?
text: WHAM. That caught Allison flush. Andrea closes her eyes:
speaker_heading: ANDREA (CONT'D)
dialog: Richard, you have to save yourself.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - NIGHT
text: A JOLT: Phillips is yanked out of a _ seat by Musi - suddenly,
text: urgently. Rage in Musi's eyes. Something's infuriated him:
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: I want you to know something. We were
dialog: all fishermen once. Other countries
dialog: come and overfish our waters, dump
dialog: all their trash here - no Somali
dialog: government to stop them. So there's
dialog: no more fishing.
text: A few feet away, Najee and Elmi pull an ORANGE SURVIVAL SUIT
text: from a bin, and begin to spread it on the floor. Odd...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: What's the survival suit for?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: We were fishermen!
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: What's it for?!
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: If your body touch the floor, it
text: makes the whole boat unclean.
text: Oh. Musi loads a 9mm handgun, hands it to Bilal. The pirates
text: drop to their knees to PRAY for Allah's blessing. Game over;
text: Phillips knows it. And he can only utter a single word:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Andrea...
text: He shuts his eyes. We SMASH TO BLACK - and...
dialog: Super: "Eight days earlier."
dialog: FADE UP AGAIN: on Phillips, when the world was still sane.
scene_heading: INT. PHILLIPS HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
dialog: 
text: Phillips is home. In bed. Studying Andrea's face as she
text: sleeps - trying to sear the image of her into his memory. He
text: knows he won't be seeing that face again for a while.
text: This is their bedroom: a four-poster bed, a crucifix on the
text: wall, timber ceiling overhead. Messy and warm, with Vermont
text: outside the window - a snowy pasture on a March morning.
text: Andrea awakens. Phillips is the first thing she sees.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: (Barry White voice)
dialog: Baby, when'll your husband be home?
text: Andrea blushes, grins. She loves when he kids like that.
text: Then the grin's gone, that fast - because she just remembered
text: what today is. Instead, sadness. Resignation. These two love
text: each other deeply. It makes the goodbyes awful.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: All packed?
text: Phillips nods. We CUT TO... a different kind of home:
scene_heading: INT. MUSI'S HUT - EYL, SOMALIA - EARLY MORNING
text: Musi awakens on a dirt floor in a stone hut. His wife, ABDI,
text: and their two kids sleep. He studies them fondly. RETURN TO:
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. PHILLIPS HOME - UPSTAIRS —- RESUMING
text: Phillips eyes his daughter's room. (She's away at school).
text: Every inch of wall space is filled with posters, bumper
text: stickers, equestrian ribbons. They make him smile.
text: Then his son's room. Lots of clutter, photos of swimsuit
text: models on the walls - and the kid himself, just awakening
dialog: now. DAN,
dialog: A blow-up,
text: 19. Phillips is angered to see him here.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Thought you were driving back to
dialog: school this morning.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Yeah. Woke up with a sore throat.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: (hates being lied to)
dialog: Uh-huh. What time'd you get in last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: It wasn't late.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Had to be after midnight - 'cause I
dialog: was still up and you weren't here.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You really gonna interrogate me, Dad?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry. Are you still sleepy?
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: It's really simple, Dan. You go to
dialog: school. Classes. That's your job.
dialog: You're either doing it or you're not.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Dad, you wanna boss people around? Do
dialog: it_on the boat, okay? Jesus.
text: that fast. Silence hangs...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You driving back, or aren't you?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Obviously.

text: SHIP'S BELL hanging here. Damn. She hates that bell. She sees *
text: Phillips descending the stairs, irritated, bags in hand. *
scene_heading: INT. MUSI'S HUT - EYL, SOMALIA - RESUMING
text: Musi's "belongings" lie in a corner, discards collected over
text: the years: someone's sun-glasses, a chipped coffee mug, a
text: book. He steps into some ratty sandals.
dialog: *
text: On a stone wall is a sliver of a mirror, too small to reflect
text: his whole face. He eyes a portion of his own reflection. *
scene_heading: EXT. PHILLIPS HOME - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER *
text: Toyota Minivan. Andrea gets in. Phillips beside her.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: I'm gonna take down that bell.

text: I keep banging my head on it.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I'll raise it, soon as I'm back.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: In July.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: In July.
text: Not a happy reality. He takes her hand. It helps a little.
text: She pulls out of the driveway. Phillips looks up:
text: There's Dan, glancing down from his bedroom window. Father
dialog: and son exchange looks. That's it. *
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: He stayed over so he could see you
dialog: off this morning.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I don't like him to miss class.

text: Departure days are always tense. And edgy. We RETURN TO:
scene_heading: INT. MUSI'S HUT - EYL, SOMALIA - RESUMING
text: Abdi hands Musi a gift, a homemade BRACELET of red cloth. He
text: smiles, takes it, kisses her. Then he goes...
scene_heading: INT. UNDERHILL, VT. - GENERAL STORE - MORNING
text: Underhill is snowy pastures, the local cemetery, a handmade
text: sign for fresh eggs, St. Thomas' Church. And a GENERAL STORE.
text: It's run by MIKE WILLARD, (60, former merchant mariner), who
text: grins as Phillips makes his usual pre-trip purchase: 15
text: pounds of "8 O'Clock Coffee" beans, in bags.
speaker_heading: MIKE WILLARD
dialog: Where ya bound on this one?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Salalah, Djibouti, Mombasa -
text: delivering handshake food.
speaker_heading: MIKE WILLARD
dialog: That's a good run.
text: Andrea tightens. No, it's not a good run. Not lately. And
text: Willard knows the tension well.
speaker_heading: MIKE WILLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Your boy gonna work for me over the

dialog: Can I get a receipt?
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - EYL, SOMALIA - MORNING
text: Musi emerges from his hut... into a wasteland: Eyl, Somalia.

text: just in time for her to blurt out:
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: Two runs a year, Richard. That was

dialog: being away that great?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You want the speech about college
dialog: tuitions and mortgages again?
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: I just want you home.
text: Phillips knows that. He sighs, looks up at the sky.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I'll be right up there, like always.
dialog: Right?
dialog: (she half-nods)
dialog: I love you.
text: He leans in. She pulls him close, urgently, shuts her eyes
text: tight. Then her guard goes up again. End of hug. He smiles.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: (Barry White voice again)
dialog: Thanks, Baby. See ya next time I'm in
dialog: town.
text: She almost laughs. Almost. One last look, then he goes, *
text: vanishing into the terminal. On Andrea's face we CUT TO: *
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - EYL, SOMALIA - MORNING *
text: Musi crosses a wind-whipped beach. No commerce here, no hope, *
text: just overturned BOATS. To his right is what used to be a FISH
text: FACTORY - abandoned now, rotting. Musi continues on... *
dialog: *
scene_heading: EXT. PORT - SALALAH, OMAN - DAY
text: Phillips emerges from a car in the port of SALALAH, OMAN.
text: This place is booming - ships everywhere, big ones... But all
text: Phillips can see is the Maersk Alabama, ugly and immense. *
text: Huge CRANES fill her hold with dumpster-sized CONTAINERS.
dialog: (She can carry 1,092 of them, but on this trip she'll only be
text: carrying 400.) She bears no flag of nationality.
dialog: 15.
text: Phillips is instantly in Captain-mode: scrutinizing how the
text: cranes are operating, how the ship's CREW is moving... Then:
speaker_heading: MURPHY (0.S.)
dialog: Good to see you, Cap.
text: Shane Murphy, the Chief Mate. These two respect one another.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You too, Shane. How's she look?
scene_heading: EXT. EYL, SOMALIA - OLD HARBOR - DOCK - MORNING *
dialog: *
text: We find a beaten TRAWLER with TEN MEN aboard it: black, lean,
text: hungry. At their feet: AK-47's, side-arms, ammunition. These
dialog: men are pirates. This trawler is their MOTHER-SHIP. *
dialog: *
dialog: *
text: It has two SKIFFS tied to its stern: motorboats. Not much for

text: Musi walks a rickety dock, approaching the pirate-trawler.
text: THREE CREW-MEMBERS see him coming. They stand at attention.
text: Bilal. Elmi. Najee. Musi nods to them and boards the Trawler.
scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - IN PORT - DAY

text: Before him is the ship's massive HOLD, home to all those

speaker_heading: MURPHY

text: Beats hauling Toyotas from Yokohama

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Lotta bulletins comin' in about

speaker_heading: PHILLIPS *
dialog: Yeah? Then why's security so lax *
dialog: around here?
dialog: (Murphy shrugs)
dialog: Engine Door, Bridge Door, Cargo
dialog: Scuttle - all of 'em wide open. I
dialog: want ‘em secured. Even in port.
text: Murphy nods. Phillips eyes the PIRATE CAGES (welded bars)
dialog: that are supposed to be protecting the STEPS rising up seven
text: stories from here to the Bridge. They're unlocked.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Pirate cages unlocked. What kinda
dialog: crew are you handing me?
text: Whoops. That was said just _as TWO CREW-MEMBERS walk by: "ATM" *
text: RAIZA (26, black) and COLIN WRIGHT (30, Southerner). They *
dialog: just decided the new Captain is an asshole. That fast. *
dialog: AT™
dialog: Cap.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: Off they go, unimpressed. Murphy waits 'til they're gone.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: They're okay. The Captain took his
dialog: foot off the gas, last few days.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I'm puttin' it back on. Spread the
dialog: word.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Cap, go easy. They lost a guy last
dialog: week, outside Djibouti.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Lost him how?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Deck Machinist, twenty-year vet. Guy
dialog: just opted out, middle of the night.
dialog: Left a note in his cabin. "Tell 'em I
dialog: went for a swim." That shit always
text: spooks a crew.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Sorry, Shane - but I need ‘em un-
dialog: spooked. And sharp. You on it?

speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: PHILLIPS

scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - IN PORT - DAY
text: The maps in here are electronic. The radar screens have data
text: scrolling across them. The radios are fed by satellite.
text: We're 120 feet above the waterline, looking out at the world
text: through massive windows. A bright, trouble-free day... But
text: there's a tension hanging, even before we've left port.
text: At the helm are KEN QUINN (2nd Mate) and ATM Raiza (whom
text: Phillips pissed off on deck). This is hushed:
dialog: AT™
dialog: I'm just sayin', Coast Guard
dialog: advisories say we should be six
text: hundred miles off-shore.
speaker_heading: KEN QUINN
dialog: You think a pirate trawler couldn't
dialog: find a ship six hundred miles out?
dialog: Murphy, ten feet away, needs to cut this off. So:
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Uh-oh. We're screwed, Fellas.
text: The guys turn... to see a sailor named DURELL (25, black,
text: fit) who just stepped on to the bridge. Durell freezes.

text: Durell's eyes go wide. Murphy looks so serious. They all do.
speaker_heading: DURELL
dialog: No...?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Write this down, Rook. Full moons and

dialog: luck. Brutal. Now go back out and do
dialog: it again.
text: Durell freezes again. Really? He starts to back out...
text: .».-when ATM and Quinn start laughing, big-time, which tells
text: Durell it's all a gag. He takes it pretty well. More laughs.
text: Then Phillips enters - and things tighten. The laughs get
dialog: choked back. He's the boss. And not big on goofing off.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Cap, this is Durell, new A.B.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Welcome to the sacred fraternity of

scene_heading: MURPHY/KEN QUINN/ATM
dialog: Yes sir.

speaker_heading: KEN QUINN
dialog: Hey, Cap. I never been on this run
dialog: before. Are the ports any good?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Askin' the wrong guy, Kenny. Cap
dialog: never leaves the ship. Doesn't matter
text: where we put in, he stays on board.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: KEN QUINN
dialog: That right, Cap?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I'm married and I'm cheap. What'm I
dialog: gonna do on shore?
text: The guys laugh. Phillips grabs a printed E-MAIL from "The
dialog: Office of Naval Intelligence." Subject: "Pirate Activity on
text: the East African Coast." He eyes it soberly, as:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay then. Dead Slow Ahead.
speaker_heading: KEN QUINN
text: Dead Slow Ahead.

scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - RESUMING

scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - STERN - AT SEA — MORNING
text: A blazing hot day. Phillips walks the length of the ship
text: again - his daily inspection tour - when he sees something:
text: Suspended above B-DECK - right where it should be - is that
text: fiberglass LIFEBOAT. 28 feet long, enclosed, looks like an
text: orange submarine, sitting on SKIDS at a 45-degree angle.
dialog: *
dialog: *
dialog: 20.
text: But ten feet below it, sitting on overturned buckets, are two

text: Phillips pauses, instantly irritated.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Enjoying your break, Fellas?
text: They eye him without alarm. Or chagrin.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Sorry, Cap. I got a slipped disc.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (at Dave:)
dialog: How're your discs?
dialog: (Dave shrugs)
dialog: Get to work. Christ. Aren't you guys
dialog: supposed to be cleaning the lifeboat?
text: And there's no smoking on deck.
text: Del and Dave put their cigs out and rise, grabbing a hose.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: No. Not a hose. Get up in a harness
text: and soogee it, with a Turk's Head.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Yep. Hosin' it ain't the same thing.
text: They eye the lifeboat, suspended above them. Hanging up there
text: in a harness sounds like a hassle. Phillips turns to go.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hey, Cap.
dialog: (Phillips turns back)
dialog: We're spittin' distance of the Somali
dialog: coast - got pirates takin' down ships
dialog: right and left. How's cleanin' a

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You need me to tune somebody up, Cap?
text: Phillips is about to reply when he sees ANOTHER BULLETIN on
dialog: the table: "Worldwide Threats to Shipping".
text: ...it's sitting in front of Ken Quinn. Clearly, he and Murphy
dialog: have been discussing it. 23 pirate attacks reported off of
dialog: East Africa in a single week.
text: Now Phillips is really irritated - because a bulletin like
text: this should NOT be loose on the ship. He grabs it.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: No. I want you to show our crew a
dialog: Goddamn map.
text: He gestures to a MAP on the wall.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Here's Somalia. Here's Mombasa.
dialog: Here's Djibouti. Here's us. Coast
dialog: Guard advisories say we should be six
text: hundred miles off-shore. Great,
dialog: except you can't be six hundred miles
dialog: away from Somalia if you're going to
dialog: Mombasa, because Mombasa is sixty
dialog: miles from the Somali border. You can
dialog: go a thousand miles straight out, but
dialog: you still gotta come back into range,
dialog: because that's our destination. And
dialog: by the way, these guys've hit ships

speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: It's Colin, yeah?
speaker_heading: WRIGHT
dialog: Yes, Cap. Colin Wright.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: There's a boat on our starboard side,
text: Colin. Two men with weapons, acting
dialog: hostile.
text: Wright turns. Marv freezes.
speaker_heading: WRIGHT
dialog: Ohhhhkay.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You have to do something about that -
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: WRIGHT
dialog: Is this a drill, Cap?
text: Phillips just stares: "Show me something." Wright rings the
text: GENERAL ALARM, which sounds throughout the ship. LOUD.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Not the general alarm. We hit the
dialog: whistle first - to let the pirates
dialog: know you are aware of them and are
text: ready to defend the ship.
text: Wright nods, sounds a WHISTLE (audible five miles away).
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now the General Alarm. Long-short,
dialog: long-short.
dialog: 23.
text: Done. ATM takes the helm. Marv still hasn't moved.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: You are...?
speaker_heading: MARV
dialog: I'm Marv, Cap.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Got pirates approaching, Marv. Hit
text: the fire pump.
text: There are two FIRE-PUMP lights on a console. One red, one
text: green. Marv hits the RED one and moves away.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Red means off. We need it ON.
speaker_heading: MARV
dialog: Got it.
text: ATM reaches over him, hits the green button... but:

dialog: The pumps aren't working, Cap. No
dialog: water pressure.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Okay. Fix it. Marv, go secure the
text: three bridge doors.
speaker_heading: MARV
dialog: Got it.
text: Marv scurries off. Phillips watches him go...
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - ENGINE ROOM - SAME
text: Guys file in, without urgency. It's just a drill.
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - LIFEBOAT - SAME
text: Whistles and alarms ring, but Del and Dave haven't moved.
speaker_heading: DEL
dialog: Nice. Can we go now?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm almost done. Relax.

text: unsecured. Not good. He spots a STEWARD, ambling by:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: What's the non-duress password?
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Mister Jones.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: No. That's the Secret Security Alarm
dialog: code. Non-duress is "suppertime."
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Suppertime. Got it.
dialog: This isn't going well.

dialog: Where you been, Marv?
speaker_heading: MARV
dialog: Captain sent me to close the doors.
speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: MARV
text: Every door on every level.
speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: MARV

speaker_heading: MURPHY *
dialog: How's it look down there?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
text: Like monkeys trying to hump a
text: football. Got watertight doors open
dialog: on the Main Engine Level; they should
text: all be secured, with deadbolts. Guys
text: running around with key-chains on
text: their hips. One set would give a
dialog: pirate access to every room on the
dialog: ship. That was in the Night Orders.
dialog: Did we get the pump fixed?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Yeah. That's done.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Okay. Let's shut this down and bring

text: ...-when something catches his eye. THREE BLIPS - coming from
text: the 10-cm RADAR SCREEN. Odd.
text: He stops. Leans in. The BLIPS indicate THREE SMALL VESSELS,
text: seven miles astern. They're moving in on us. Fast.
dialog: Just like they would if this were the real thing. Hmmm..
text: Phillips grabs a pair of BINOCULARS and heads outside, to:
scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - PORT SIDE BRIDGE WING - CONTINUING

scene_heading: PHILLIPS' POV - ACROSS WATER - CONTINUING
text: Two MOTORBOATS pound through FOUR-FOOT SWELLS at 21 knots,

text: But they certainly are moving like pirates would. Real ones.
scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - PORT SIDE BRIDGE WING - RESUMING
text: Phillips lowers the binoculars. Collects himself. Returns to:
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
text: He moves to the Engine Order Telegraph, leans on it a bit. A
text: gage tells us his RPM's just shot up to 122 revs. The ship
text: surges forward. The men notice. He looks to Murphy:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Call down to the Engine Room. Tell
dialog: ‘em to let me know if anything goes
dialog: red. I'm increasing our speed.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Cap? We still in the drill?

dialog: United Kingdom Maritime Trade
dialog: Operations.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO PHONE)
dialog: This is the Maersk Alabama - position

speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO PHONE) (cont'd)
dialog: one hundred eighty, and speed at
dialog: seventeen knots. We have two skiffs
text: approaching at five-point-five miles,
text: with a possible mother ship behind
dialog: them. Potential piracy situation.
dialog: That got everyone's attention. But it's still a drill. Right?
speaker_heading: UKMTO OPERATOR (THRU PHONE)
dialog: It's probably just fishermen. But you
dialog: should get your crew together and get
dialog: your fire-hoses ready. And you may
dialog: want to get the ship locked up.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO PHONE)
dialog: We understand that, thank you. Will
dialog: keep you posted.
speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: They aren't here to fish.

scene_heading: EXT. PORT SIDE BRIDGE WING - RESUMING
text: Another look through the binoculars. More DETAILED now:
text: The skiffs are getting CLOSER, despite the four-foot SWELLS.
text: Somalis. With AK-47's. (Musi and his crew aboard one; a
dialog: pirate named ASAD and his crew on the other.) In other words:

speaker_heading: MURPHY

speaker_heading: DURELL

scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Spacious quarters. Phillips reads an E-MAIL from Andrea:
dialog: "It snowed again today. I keep thinking how much you love
dialog: that. And every morning I wake up on your side of the bed. So
dialog: I must be missing you. Yes, definitely missing you. Miss your
dialog: voice. And I miss those great long LETTERS you used to write
dialog: to me when you were gone. E-mail stinks. Love you. Andrea."
text: Phillips breathes out a smile, looks out his window - a sky
text: full of stars. Then he STOPS. Just heard a BANGING noise.
text: It's outside his door. He opens the door to investigate:
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUING
text: Here's the source of the noise: Marv. Slumped against a

speaker_heading: MARV
dialog: Guess I'll get another ship then.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You do that.
dialog: Phillips turns to go... but:
speaker_heading: MARV
dialog: By the way... his name was Sam.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MARV
dialog: The Deck Machinist who opted out...
dialog: His name was Sam. Four kids he sent
text: money home to, and an ex-wife. Who
dialog: takes care of them now, huh?
dialog: (Phillips is silent)
dialog: Ship keeps sailing, I know; he was

text: There it was. Phillips pauses. The guys await an answer.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Most likely, yeah.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: And, uh... That gonna be the program
dialog: again? Evasive maneuvers?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: That's the book. Why?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I didn't much like being outgunned.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Me neither. But they have weapons and
dialog: we don't. So evasion's all we got.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Then maybe we should have weapons.
text: A few guys nod. Clearly, it's been discussed in here tonight.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS

text: Phillips looks to Murphy, who looks away: "Can't help you."
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: If the hoses don't keep them away,

text: wire the stairways.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: That's bringing a stick to a
dialog: gunfight, Cap.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Hey, we get in a gunfight and lose,
dialog: we could have twenty sailors killed
dialog: or captured - huh? You all know the
dialog: orders. If we're boarded, the crew
dialog: gets to their muster points and we go
text: dark and cold. Power off. Lights off.
dialog: And we stay that way. Our performance
dialog: today was embarrassing. And by the
dialog: way, the non-duress codeword is
text: "suppertime." Half the crew still
dialog: doesn't know it. Unless you hear it,
dialog: you stay sequestered. No one on this
text: crew is going to be taken hostage.
dialog: AT™
text: Somebody's trying to hijack a ship,
dialog: it goes against a sailor's nature to

speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You guys wanna know the truth?
dialog: (they're waiting)
dialog: The truth is, I don't feel any better

speaker_heading: HUFAN (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

speaker_heading: ASAD (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

speaker_heading: HUFAN (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

dialog: 
text: Then, that fast, the POWER GOES OUT. Consoles, screens, A/C.
text: All dead. And we're adrift. Musi looks around.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: We shut the engines down too fast.
dialog: (pure bullshit)
dialog: There's a check-down procedure. We

speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Stop this circling! Straighten the

text: Phillips "tries", turning the wheel, to no effect.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: We shut it all down too fast! Ship's

speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Move.
text: Phillips obliges. Musi tries the instruments, futilely, as:

speaker_heading: NAJEE

text: yelling out of sheer terror.
text: ..-when a single unexpected sound pierces the air.
text: A knock, at the bridge door.
text: Everything stops. Every head turns. Musi nods to Phillips:
text: "Go open it." Phillips crosses to the door, opens it. Sighs.
text: ..-because it's Marv. Of course. Right where he shouldn't be.
text: Phillips can hardly believe it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARV
dialog: Cap?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: C'mon in, Marv. You're dead.
text: Before Marv can reply, Elmi grabs him by the collar and puts
text: him on the ground next to ATM and Wright.
text: But the crisis, oddly, has passed. Musi eyes Phillips:
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Let's go. We search the ship.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: For what?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Your crew.
text: Phillips discreetly keys his radio, so this'll be broadcast:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You wanna search the ship? Good. I'm

text: Musi pushes Phillips to the door, nods to Bilal.
speaker_heading: MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)

speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I want your assurance that my men
dialog: won't be harmed in any way.
text: Musi pauses, breathes out a grin... then says something to
text: Najee and Elmi in Somali. They nod. Then:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MUSI

speaker_heading: JOHN CRONAN

scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - MAIN DECK - SAME
text: Perry emerges from the PORT STAIRWELL. His eyes adjust.
dialog: 57.
text: From here, he can see across the deck. 50 feet away is his

text: feet long, ten feet wide. Green. But:
text: Straight above it, seven stories off the deck, is a grated
text: metal WALKWAY jutting off the Bridge.

dialog: I've got the generator in sight.
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING
text: Musi enters Phillips' QUARTERS. He can't help but react.
text: The place feels palatial to him. A large room, sunlit by big
text: windows. With an OFFICE and a SATELLITE OFFICE jutting off
text: it. He begins to drift through, taking it all in.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Standard Captain's Quarters. Then we
text: can drop down to D-Deck.
text: Musi pauses. Before him is a MIRROR. Might be the biggest one
text: Musi's ever seen. He eyes his own reflection as if he'd never
text: seen his whole face before. An odd, private moment.
text: Then he notices PICTURES - of Andrea, and Dan, and Phillips'
text: daughter MARIAH. Musi reacts; Phillips catches it.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: You have a family?
text: Musi half-nods, looks at the picture of Dan...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: When he was a boy and I had to go to
text: sea, he'd stand in front of the door
dialog: to keep me from leaving. He still
dialog: kids me about it: "My father never

speaker_heading: MUSI

scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - MESS-DECK - CORRIDOR - SAME
text: Sudden BLACKNESS. The Emergency Power just shut off.

speaker_heading: PHILLIPS

dialog: it'll make you work harder.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Then I'm a prick. Good!
dialog: (Phillips almost laughs)
dialog: You treat sailors too nice, you get
text: soft sailors. Lazy, lazy. Captain has
dialog: to be a prick.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: No. He doesn't. It's just a habit.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: If you keep 'em scared of you, maybe
dialog: they sail better - then you don't
dialog: have pirates taking your ship away.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: That wasn't them. That was me.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I always thought when the time came
dialog: I'd be able to outrun you. My
dialog: mistake.
text: The men heard that too. But Musi wasn't listening.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: What's that door?
text: Musi's pointing at the very door separating him from all
text: these men, the AFTER-STEERING ROOM DOOR. Uh-oh...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: That's a Haz-Mat closet.
text: Musi weighs that. Bilal wincing. The moment just hanging...
text: Then Musi moves on, choosing not to open the After-Steering
dialog: 
text: door. He just heads out. Bilal follows, limping.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: We should get back to the bridge.
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - AFTER-STEERING ROOM - RESUMING
text: Massive relief on the faces in here. Some gratitude too.
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - DAY
text: ATM, Wright, and Marv on the floor. Najee and Elmi on guard.
text: The door opens. Phillips, Musi and Bilal return - Bilal
text: hobbling, bleeding badly. Najee and Elmi are silent, only
dialog: because voicing disappointment would be insubordinate.
text: But Musi can feel their anxiousness. It infuriates him. So:
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: We go search again.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: That's a waste of time.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: My ship now! Understand?
speaker_heading: + eH
speaker_heading: +H HK
dialog: 66.
text: He grabs that FLARE GUN off a desk, and: *
scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - PORT BRIDGE-WING - CONTINUING
text: From here, Musi can see his SKIFF, bobbing gently aport. *
text: It's a tiny target, one that Phillips missed several times.
text: But Musi takes aim with that flare. A single shot...
text: BULLSEYE. The flare hits. The skiff catches fire.
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - CONTINUING
text: Musi returns. From here, all the men can see the SMOKE rising
text: from the burning skiff. It's unsettling, for the pirates too.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: I decide! We look again!
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You wanna find my crew? Then take
dialog: these guys.
text: He gestures to ATM, Wright, and Marv. Musi's thrown.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: The crew's not gonna respond to me.
dialog: I'm the guy they're mutinying
dialog: against. Take them.
text: Musi pauses, wary. Eyes the three crew members... then:
speaker_heading: MUSI
speaker_heading: (xe: ATM)
dialog: I take the Muslim.
dialog: Phillips sags; he'd wanted all his men off this bridge... *
text: Musi grabs an AK, yanks ATM up off the floor - but: *
dialog: AT™ *
dialog: They aren't gonna come out if you're *
dialog: armed. *
dialog: (Musi pauses) *
dialog: It's a respect thing. They're *
dialog: sailors. *
text: Musi considers that, studies ATM - a long beat - then crosses *
dialog: *
text: to Najee, handing off the AK and mumbling instructions.
dialog: *
text: .--which gives Phillips a chance to mumble to ATM, out of
text: Musi's earshot - while KEYING his radio: *
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Take him to the guys. They'll know
dialog: what to do.
text: ATM nods. Musi returns, studies ATM.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: You really a Muslim?
dialog: AT™
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Then why you sail with these guys?
dialog: AT™
dialog: Why you sail with pirates?
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: ‘Cuz pirates own the water, Brother.
text: He grabs a LONG-KNIFE, and pushes ATM out the door. Phillips
text: watches, concerned but hopeful. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PHILLIPS' HOME - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: 2 a.m. Andrea sleeps. Outside, a cold WIND blows. Hard.
text: She's sleeping through it... until the wind jogs that old
text: SHIP'S BELL on the patio. It rings. And her eyes open.
text: Fear, that fast. She knows something's wrong... We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - LATER DAY
text: TWO HOURS have passed, in silence and heat. Tension hanging.
text: Phillips is removing the glass from Bilal's feet. It feels
text: like kindness, but Bilal can't quite trust it.
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: Where are they? Where they go?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I don't know. I'm here with you.
dialog: (Najee grunts, irritated)
dialog: Colin. Marv. Go look for them.
dialog: Wait. What? The pirates eye Phillips. So do Wright and Marv.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: My men know the ship. They'll find
dialog: ‘em. And that way you guys can stay
text: up here on the bridge.
dialog: 68.
dialog: A pretty bold play - and Wright's fairly sure it isn't going
text: to fly. But Najee decides quickly... turns to Wright:
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: (re: Phillips)
dialog: You no come back, he die.
text: Wright nods, rises. Marv too. The pirates feign disinterest.
text: .»-which gives Phillips a chance to say to Wright, quietly:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I don't expect to see you two back up
dialog: here. Is that understood?
text: Wright nods. Marv half-nods. They head for the door...
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - ENGINE DECK - PASSAGEWAY - SAME
text: 125 degrees now. Sweltering. ATM leads Musi.
dialog: AT™
text: This leads to the Engine Room and the
dialog: After-Steering.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: I know the boat. Why you guys all
dialog: talk so much?
dialog: 
text: ATM's about to reply... when they both stop. Shocked.
text: Musi's flashlight just landed on a FACE - Perry - 20 feet
text: away. Perry ducks behind a corner. Musi starts after him. ATM
text: has to do something about it. He grabs Musi, but:
text: Musi strikes him with the flashlight across the jaw and
text: charges down the corridor. We FOLLOW...
text: ...through this dark, tight space - just a flashlight beam
text: and Musi's heavy breaths. Around that corner, when:
text: A JOLT OUT OF THE DARKNESS - Perry, lunging at Musi with the
text: JACK-KNIFE, slicing into Musi's hand. Musi howls, drops his
text: long-knife and the flashlight.
text: ATM jumps in now, grabbing the injured pirate, backing him up
text: against a bulkhead. Perry puts the knife to Musi's throat.
text: There's a RADIO on Perry's hip. He grabs it, flips it on:
speaker_heading: PERRY (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Hey, Pirates. Come in, Pirates.
dialog: 69.
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - SAME
text: The Pirates turn, deeply thrown. That voice, crackling
text: through the RADIO overhead. Who is that?
speaker_heading: PERRY (THRU RADIO, CONT'D)
dialog: This is the crew of the Maersk
dialog: Alabama. We have your Captain.
text: Phillips grins. But the pirates are irate.
speaker_heading: PERRY (THRU RADIO, CONT'D)
dialog: Do you read, Pirates? We have your
dialog: captain. Will trade him for our
dialog: men... and for you guys getting the
dialog: hell off this ship.
text: The Pirates confer intensely in Somali... until it's decided
text: that Najee will reply. He grabs the radio.
speaker_heading: NAJEE (INTO RADIO)
dialog: You have our guy?
speaker_heading: PERRY (THRU RADIO)
dialog: Yeah. Bleeding, but we got him.
speaker_heading: NAJEE (INTO RADIO)
dialog: We don't have a boat.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Take our lifeboat. On the stern.
text: Najee lowers the radio, looks to Phillips:
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: We need money.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: It's in my room.
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: Show me.
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - E-DECK - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - EVENING
text: Phillips opens his safe, extracts $30,000.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Thirty thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: And how much you worth, Irish? How
dialog: much a couple of your guys worth?
dialog: 70.
text: That had some edge. Phillips hands over the cash.
scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - B-DECK - STARBOARD STERN - EVENING
text: The lifeboat sits on those skids, above B-Deck. Anyone inside
text: it will drop from here, 45 feet straight into the sea.
text: Elmi, Najee, and Bilal eye it, trying to look undaunted.
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: Need more fuel.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: We can arrange that.
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: And food. Water.
text: Phillips calls out... one deck up... to:
scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - C-DECK - CONTINUING
text: Murphy and Durell are one deck above the lifeboat, watching:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: They want some food.
text: Murphy looks to Durell, who nods, under his breath:
speaker_heading: DURELL
dialog: I'll go find something spoiled.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Pork. Make sure it's pork.
text: Durell smiles, goes. Murphy leans over and half-waves to the
text: three Pirates, as if he were their best pal:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Food's on the way!
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: You show us our captain!
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Soon as you're in the water.
text: Najee doesn't like it. Murphy doesn't care.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Let's go get your fuel.
dialog: 71.
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - EMERGENCY GENERATOR ROOM - EVENING
text: Phillips siphons fuel from a DIESEL GENERATOR into buckets.
text: Najee stands guard. Elmi is a few feet away, flipping the
text: same GENERATOR switches that Perry used to kill the power.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Will you please leave those alone?
speaker_heading: ELMI
dialog: You trouble, Irish. You pain in the
dialog: ass.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: No. More fuel.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Where ya headed? Disneyworld?
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: More.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - SUSPENDED - EVENING
text: Najee, Elmi, and Bilal get their first look inside the
text: lifeboat: hatches, seats, the elevated bridge... (They don't
dialog: know it yet, but this will be "home" for the next few days.)
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Once you're in and secured, you're
dialog: gonna hit this valve. Might take a
dialog: few pumps. The cog releases, and you
text: go down the skids and into the water.
text: Najee should be nodding. He isn't. Something odd about that.
text: But before Phillips can react... he sees the caricature of
text: himself, drawn by Dave. And the words "Philips is a shit."
text: Phillips eyes it, breathes out an ironic smile.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: At least spell my name right...
text: The pirates don't comment. He moves on:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Your food's here.
text: Najee nods. Phillips steps through the AFT HATCH, to:
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - B-DECK — CONTINUING
text: Bilal and Elmi watch as Durell steps forward with a box of
text: FOOD, covered with tinfoil. Phillips gets a whiff, smiles.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Specialty of the house, huh?
speaker_heading: DURELL
dialog: Steward called it “horse-cock."
text: Phillips grins. Murphy is ten feet away, glaring at the
text: pirates. They're keeping a watchful eye on him.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Crew holding up okay?
speaker_heading: DURELL
dialog: Couple heat-strokes, but they're
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: See that they get treated, huh?
speaker_heading: DURELL
dialog: Why, Cap? You goin' somewhere?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Ya never know.
text: That hangs there. He turns to the pirates:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Okay. Get yourselves harnessed in.
dialog: We'll send your captain down to you
dialog: once you're in the water.
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: No.
text: That halted things. Murphy waits. Phillips not reacting, as:
speaker_heading: NAJEE (CONT'D)
dialog: You come in water with us. When we
dialog: have captain back, you show him how
dialog: boat works, then you go free.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: That wasn't the deal, Asshole.
text: Najee points an AK right at Murphy's head, and:
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: New deal.
dialog: 73.
text: That fast, everything ramps up. Elmi points his AK at Durell.
text: Bilal, on one foot, points his at the guys on C-Deck. And
dialog: suddenly everybody's barking - Somali vs. English:
speaker_heading: NAJEE (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: crew-members )
dialog: Who you like least, Captain? Who you
dialog: don't mind if they dead?
text: More barking. More AK-pointing, testosterone rising - until:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Belay that! All of you!
text: The barking stops. We PUSH IN on Phillips...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: (at Najee)
dialog: Stop threatening my crew.
speaker_heading: NAJEE
dialog: You get in the boat, nobody shout at
dialog: nobody.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Then let's go.
text: The pirates lower their weapons, heading for the lifeboat.
text: Phillips too. No one on the crew can believe it.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Wait a minute. You're goin' in the
dialog: water with these guys?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Send him down once we're underway. On
text: the ladder amidship.
text: Murphy's at a loss. The whole crew is.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: How 'bout I go instead? And you stay
dialog: on deck. I can show 'em how it works
dialog: as good as you.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You buckin' for overtime pay now?
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Cap, you get in there with them, you
dialog: ain't comin' out.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: We want ‘em off the boat, right?
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Yeah. But not like this.
text: Phillips climbs in the lifeboat.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Cap...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Crew's yours, Shane. You got it?
text: A last look between them. Feels like a goodbye. Murphy nods.
text: Then Phillips "dogs" (closes) the aft hatch.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUING
text: Phillips, sealed in with them now, moves to the bridge.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Get your yourselves secured. This
text: thing drops like a stone.
text: The seats in here have harnesses like those on a carnival
text: ride. Bilal, Elmi, and Najee strap themselves in, facing aft.
speaker_heading: BILAL
dialog: Hey, Irish. How come you do that?
dialog: Your guy wanna take your place in
dialog: here with the dangerous pirates. How
dialog: come you say no?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I'm Captain. He's crew. Are you
dialog: harnessed in?
text: Bilal nods without understanding. Phillips grabs a radio:
scene_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
text: They can still strafe the ship, so
dialog: keep the guys out of harm's way.
speaker_heading: PERRY (THRU RADIO)
dialog: Roger that.
scene_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: How's his hand?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. MAERSK - C-DECK - SAME (EVENING)
text: Musi, bound and gagged, his hand bleeding profusely, has been
text: brought up to C-Deck under guard. Perry eyes him.
speaker_heading: PERRY (INTO RADIO)
dialog: He'll live.
dialog: 75.
scene_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: Okay. Releasing lifeboat now.
text: Phillips puts the radio down, harnesses himself in, grabs a
text: RELEASE VALVE, (a hydraulic pump.) Starts PUMPING it, as:
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. MAERSK - B-DECK - RESUMING
text: A COG holds the lifeboat on these skids.
text: Now it's receding, hydraulically...
text: .+.-as Phillips keeps pumping the valve, eyeing the pirates.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: (quietly, eyes heavenward)
dialog: God, if you have to kill someone on
dialog: this drop, I'd appreciate it not
dialog: being me...
text: A few more pumps on that release valve, then:
text: .+.the COG on the skids falls away.
text: ..-and the lifeboat, unmoored, rockets down the skids. 12
text: feet, like a sled, nose down, then off the edge of the ship:
scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - STERN - CONTINUING
text: A 45-FOOT DEAD DROP, hurtling toward the water.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - FALLING - CONTINUING
text: The pirates are stunned by their own velocity. Phillips
text: braces himself. The surface rushing up to meet him, then:
text: A THUNDEROUS PLUNGE as the lifeboat smashes into the sea,
text: sending up a huge plume, vanishing under water.
text: It's like a car wreck in here, bodies hurtling, banging,
dialog: restrained by those harnesses. Water ABOVE us... until:
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. WATER-LINE - CONTINUING
text: The nose of the lifeboat breaches the surface, its bridge ten
text: feet above the waterline, visible through those WINDOWS.
dialog: 
text: Phillips gathers his wits, looks to his passengers.
speaker_heading: PERRY (THRU RADIO)
dialog: Cap, you okay?
scene_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: We're okay. Bring him amidship.
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: EXT. MAERSK - DECK - STARBOARD - EVENING
text: Murphy on deck. Musi, hand badly BLEEDING, is beside him.
text: The lifeboat - powered by a 4 cylinder diesel engine - pulls
text: up alongside the Maersk 20 feet below, idling amidship.
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: You go in, he comes out. Right?
text: Musi smiles. The whole crew is watching from various decks -
text: as he begins to climb down his own ladder, slowly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. LIFEBOAT - WATER-LINE - CONTINUING
text: Elmi opens the aft hatch, points his AK at the Maersk crew
text: again. Nobody flinches. Musi keeps descending.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/INT. LIFEBOAT - CONTINUING
text: Through the cockpit window, Phillips can see Murphy on the
text: Maersk deck - but there's an ocean between them now.
text: Phillips clutches the radio... then:
scene_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: Listen, Shane. This ship is due in
text: Mombasa two days from now.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (INTO RADIO)
dialog: That's what the schedule says.
scene_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: I expect you to get it there.
text: That lands. And Murphy doesn't like it. He watches Musi,
text: descending, then looks to the open hatch, doing the math.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (INTO RADIO)
dialog: I got a better idea. How ‘bout you
dialog: jump outta that lifeboat, right now.
scene_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: Can't do that, Shane. You know that.
speaker_heading: MURPHY (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Cap, enough of this already. Get the
dialog: hell outta there. We can take these
dialog: assholes.
scene_heading: PHILLIPS (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: Crew did a helluva job today; you did
dialog: too. Tell ‘em that, okay?
dialog: 77.
text: Murphy's about to respond when...
dialog: Musi
text: INT.
dialog: Musi
dialog: look
text: reaches the hatch, and climbs in - leaving it open.
scene_heading: LIFEBOAT - CONTINUING
text: eyes Phillips, and Bilal's now-bandaged foot, (with a
text: of mild scorn.) Najee quickly hands over the $30,000.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Not much to operating this thing;
dialog: I'll take you through it. If you want
dialog: me to fix up your hand there's a med-
dialog: kit behind you.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Did you say goodbye to your men?
dialog: So much for pretense. Phillips expected that.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Good.
text: ..-which is when - no surprise - Musi grabs Phillips and
text: shoves him to the floor, then throws the hatch shut, and
dialog: guns
text: the throttle, the lifeboat speeding away.
text: The crew on the Maersk holler, but they're helpless.
text: Phillips is shoved into a seat at gunpoint. No expression.
dialog: EXT.
scene_heading: MAERSK —- DECK — RESUMING

speaker_heading: MURPHY

text: the tiny aft hatch - again, Phillips watching.
scene_heading: EXT. LIFEBOAT - AFT DECK - SAME
text: Musi tosses the styrofoam box into the water, then spots

text: Without comment he surrenders the knife... and unwraps the

text: CLICK. He's just dry-firing it, but the flinch from Phillips
text: made Elmi smile. The tenor in here has gotten meaner. Sicker.
text: Najee knots that three-colored rope. Musi's on the bridge.
text: Bilal is silent. The lifeboat muscles along.
text: ..-when, unsolicited, Phillips begins to speak:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: So it's the beginning of time. Adam's
dialog: the first man ever. And all of his
text: body parts hold a meeting, to see who
dialog: should be in charge.
text: Wait. Is he telling a joke? Now? Elmi can't believe it.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Adam's heart says, "I think I should
dialog: run things, 'cause if I stop pumping,
dialog: he dies." But his eyes say, "Wait a
dialog: minute, we think we should run
dialog: things. I mean, without us, he
dialog: couldn't see anything, or get
dialog: around." Then his brain says, "I'm
dialog: obviously the most important organ. I
dialog: control breathing, thinking,
dialog: everything." A real argument.
text: No doubt about it; he's telling a joke. Musi turns, intrigued
text: by the balls on this guy. Najee and Bilal too, watching...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
text: Then, from down deep, a quiet voice
dialog: pipes in. "Excuse me. But I think I'm
dialog: the most important body part." It was
dialog: the asshole talking.
text: The pirates eye one another, mild disbelief and amusement.
dialog: *
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
text: The other body parts just laughed at
dialog: him - get serious, buddy - and went
dialog: back to work, deciding to vote on it
dialog: in a couple days.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: But the next morning, the asshole
text: surprised them all. He shut down.
dialog: Wouldn't let anything through.
dialog: Breakfast, lunch, dinner - nothing.
dialog: And pretty soon, the whole body began
dialog: to suffer. The brain got foggy, the
text: heart could barely beat, the eyes
dialog: couldn't stay open. After three days
dialog: of it they all came to him and said,
dialog: "Okay! Okay! You win! You're the most
dialog: important! We give!" Argument over.
dialog: (eyes on Musi now)
dialog: And that's why, ever since, all
dialog: through history... it's assholes who
dialog: have always been in charge.
text: There it was, a huge fuck-you, aimed right at Musi. Silence.
text: ...-then Bilal can't help himself. He starts to laugh. Elmi
text: too. Then Najee. Even Musi finds himself chuckling. Phillips
text: too. Five strung-out overheated guys, laughing.
text: -..until this boat is suddenly ROCKED by an unseen force -
text: pounding it, turning it SIDEWAYS. The pirates are knocked to
text: their feet - it's that violent. And NOISY, deafening:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LIFEBOAT - AT SEA - CONTINUING
text: One of those NAVY KNIGHTHAWK HELICOPTERS is hovering right
text: above us - its rotors' GALE-FORCE WIND literally knocking the
text: lifeboat sideways. A pretty impressive show of force.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - MOVING - RESUMING
text: Musi struggles with the wheel, but it's useless. The craft
text: isn't powerful enough to keep its heading.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: What are they doing, Irish?
text: Phillips keeps his eyes on those FUEL BUCKETS - sliding
text: around. The wind keeps pounding us. And that noise...
speaker_heading: MUSI (CONT'D)
dialog: What are they doing?!
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I don't know. I'm here with you.
dialog: 98.
text: Musi, livid, guns the engine. But it dies on him.
text: Now the powerless lifeboat is pushed in a CIRCLE by the wind.
text: Spinning like a top, buffeted by air and noise. Musi's men,
dialog: dizzied, await his orders... as:
speaker_heading: GARRIDOS (THRU LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: Garridos for lifeboat. Come in.
text: Musi doesn't answer - just hits the ignition again. The
dialog: engine won't turn over.
speaker_heading: GARRIDOS (THRU LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: Garridos for lifeboat. Come in,
dialog: lifeboat.
text: We're spinning in circles, deafened by the noise - the
text: Knighthawk literally sitting right on top of us...
speaker_heading: MUSI (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong with your boat, Irish?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Now it's my boat again?
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: What's wrong with it?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: How the hell should I know?
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: You baby, Phillips. Lazy American.
text: Musi fumes. His men await a plan. Noise pounding. Sniper
text: teams waiting on the Bainbridge. Everything closing in.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/INT. USS BAINBRIDGE - CIC - RESUMING
text: Garridos, with Aboitiz and Castellano hovering:
speaker_heading: GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
dialog: This is Garridos, Captain. You having
dialog: engine trouble?
speaker_heading: MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: You pull back now!
speaker_heading: GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Hey, I'm just a guest on this boat. I
dialog: can't tell the Captain what to do.
dialog: But I can send over a mechanic to

speaker_heading: MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: Pull back! No military action!
speaker_heading: GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Fine. What will you give me?
speaker_heading: MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: I give you his ears! I give you his

dialog: I told you! I talk only to insurance
dialog: man! Only to money man!
speaker_heading: GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Sorry. I'm all you got. And we cannot

text: We PUSH IN on Musi, all that noise bearing down on him, as:
speaker_heading: MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: (ice cold)
dialog: Fine. We die here then.
text: He slams the radio down, looks at his men:
speaker_heading: MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
dialog: Finish the ropes.
dialog: That sounded permanent, and Phillips looks shaken. We're
text: still spinning, getting hammered by the rotor wind...
speaker_heading: MUSI (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong, Phillips? You don't
dialog: want to die at sea? What kind of
dialog: sailor are you?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Like to see my wife again. And my
dialog: kids.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: American sailors are all babies.
speaker_heading: GARRIDOS (THRU LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: Captain! Come in.
speaker_heading: MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
dialog: Untie him.
text: Elmi starts to untie Phillips, as:
speaker_heading: GARRIDOS (THRU RADIO)
dialog: Why don't you come aboard now? Get
dialog: some medical care. We'll figure a way
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: He HHH OK
dialog: %
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: GARRIDOS (THRU RADIO) (cont'd)
dialog: out of this thing. We can set up a
dialog: tow-line from our fantail, so you
dialog: don't drift into hostile waters. We
dialog: know there are rival tribes around
dialog: here. Look, a gesture of goodwill:
text: The noise suddenly STOPS, the chopper pulling up. SILENCE.
text: Somehow, that infuriates Musi even worse. He decides:
speaker_heading: MUSI (INTO LIFEBOAT RADIO)
dialog: Okay. We gonna kill the hostage now.
dialog: Need a bodybag over here. Out.
text: End of transmission. He marches toward Phillips - at the very
text: moment Phillips, untied by Elmi, falls into a seat... and our
text: narrative catches up to itself COMPLETELY, as:
text: A JOLT: Phillips yanked out of the seat by Musi - suddenly,
text: urgently. Rage in Musi's eyes, infuriated by all this...
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: I want you to know something. We were
dialog: all fishermen once. Other countries
dialog: come and overfish our waters, dump
dialog: all their trash here - no Somali
dialog: government to stop them. So there's
dialog: no more fishing.
text: A few feet away, Najee and Elmi pull an ORANGE SURVIVAL SUIT
text: from a bin, and begin to spread it on the floor. Odd...
text: IMAGES, JUMP-CUT: Musi handing the 9mm to Bilal; the pirates
dialog: kneeling down to pray for Allah's blessing, and:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Andrea...
text: He shuts his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. PHILLIPS' HOME - BACK PATIO - DAY
text: Allison emerges on to the patio - to find Andrea, hiding here
text: again, alone against the snow, staring sadly at that old
speaker_heading: SHIP'S BELL.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: (re: bell)
dialog: He's so stubborn about things.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: I'm counting on it.
text: Andrea smiles. Allison sits.

speaker_heading: ALLISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Your family's doing a prayer circle.
dialog: You wanna come in?
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: The Navy's not expecting a good
dialog: result. Are they.
text: Bam. That put Allison on her heels. She regroups, then:
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: The Navy's doing exactly what it set
dialog: out to do - isolate the pirates and
dialog: keep them from getting to shore.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: But they can't launch a rescue
dialog: without getting him killed. And
dialog: there's no way the U.S. Government
dialog: could allow the pirates to take
dialog: ransom and escape prosecution. So...
dialog: (Allison's silent)
dialog: Has anybody said anything to you
dialog: about preparing me for the worst?
text: No reply. The answer, obviously, is yes.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: It's not an indicator of our
dialog: confidence in the outcome...
text: That sounded lame, and she knows it. A beat passes...
speaker_heading: ALLISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to come in with us?
text: Andrea starts to cry again, can't quite hold it in.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: I think I'll take a walk instead.
text: And away she goes, off the patio and out into the SNOWY FIELD
text: beyond. Allison, helpless, just watches her go.
text: From here, Andrea grows smaller and smaller. We CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - NOT MOVING - SAME
text: The pirates pray to Allah. Phillips watches, powerless...
text: We CIRCLE AROUND him, his breath shortening, heart rate
text: climbing - as these men pray for a blessing to kill him.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: You're not gonna get paradise and
dialog: seventy-two virgins for doing this.
dialog: You're just gonna get your men
dialog: killed.
text: Musi looks up from his prayer, his eyes lifeless:
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Keep talking, Irish...
text: That was chilling. Musi returns to his prayer, then gives an
text: order in Somali. The pirates get to their feet.
text: Najee grabs that THREE-COLORED ROPE now, weaving it through
text: Phillips' hands. Carefully. We hear "Halal. Halal."
text: We PUSH IN ON PHILLIPS - as he steels himself for one last
dialog: stand. Just can't let himself surrender too easily. *
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Bring him over.
text: Elmi grabs Phillips, starts to pull him on to the orange
dialog: survival suit. But there's a problem, instantly:
text: Phillips isn't moving.
text: Huh? Elmi tries again - but Phillips digs in and puts his *
text: fists under his chin. Not moving.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS *
dialog: No. Sorry. *
text: What? They scream at him, livid.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: You make hands-up posture now!
dialog: Execution posture!
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I'm not moving.
text: Musi shouts at Elmi, who shouts at Phillips. Najee and Bilal
text: jump in too, Bilal pointing that handgun at him - as we:
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/EXT. UNDERHILL - WOODS - DAY
text: Andrea walks, all alone and shaky as hell. Then she STOPS... *
text: And turns. Some instinct just told her to get back home... *
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING
text: The pirates grab him and throw him on to the survival suit.
dialog: 103.
text: But he won't stand still, or drop to his knees. They howl.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: You make hands-up posture!
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: You going against the preaching!
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/INT. PHILLIPS HOME - CONTINUING
text: 15 people form a PRAYER CIRCLE, heads bowed. We CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING (NIGHT)
text: The pirates try to push Phillips down, try to get his fists
text: out from under his chin. But he WILL NOT BUDGE.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: You can't go against the preaching!
text: Four guys pushing on him, howling. But he just won't comply.
text: Keeps his fists under his chin... as we:
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
text: MARIAH PHILLIPS, 18, drives too fast - blinking back tears.
text: Listening to NPR, a report about her father. Just get home.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING
text: Phillips is kicking, twisting, defying, keeping his fists
text: under his chin. Musi is shouting, spit flying.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: You make the good posture! Hands up!
dialog: You make the good posture!
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERHILL - WOODS - RESUMING
text: Andrea, running home. She steps onto an icy slick and loses

scene_heading: INT. PHILLIPS HOME - RESUMING
text: 15 people, heads down, hands together, praying. We JUMP TO:
scene_heading: INT. MAERSK - BRIDGE - SAME
text: The men of the Maersk - Murphy, ATM, Durell - huddled at a
text: radio, waiting for word. Mike Perry silently praying...
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING
text: Phillips keeps resisting, fighting, kicking, never moving his
text: fists from under his chin. Pirates howling, spitting, until:
text: THUMP. Silence. Everything goes white.
text: Bilal just butt-ended him in the head with the handgun.
text: Phillips falls forward, on to the suit. Everything foggy.
dialog: 
text: He's on the ritual rug now. Certain he's about to die. The
text: pirates start WHOOPING again, celebrating... when:
speaker_heading: MUSI (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
dialog: Stop.
dialog: (his men eye him)
dialog: Look at the rope.
text: Silence. The pirates examine the three-colored rope they'd
text: labored so hard to fashion. It has Phillips' BLOOD on it now.
text: He SPITS on it, weakly, for good measure. Ritual spoiled.
text: The pirates sag and drift away. Phillips is about to pass out
text: on the survival suit when he hears:
speaker_heading: BRITISH VOICE (THRU RADIO)
text: Pirate Lifeboat. Pirate lifeboat.
dialog: This is Reuters news service. Do you
dialog: read? Reuters news--
text: We STAY WITH PHILLIPS, as we hear Musi answer:
speaker_heading: MUSI (0.S., INTO RADIO)
dialog: This is pirate lifeboat. We are
dialog: surrounded by warships and don't have
dialog: time to talk. Please pray for us.
text: Phillips' eyes begin to close. Then he's out.
scene_heading: INT. PHILLIPS HOME - NIGHT
text: Everyone's quiet. Andrea enters from the back patio, just as:
speaker_heading: MARIAH (0.S.)
dialog: Mom?
text: Mariah, stepping through the front door. Bereft. And barely
text: visible behind all the food platters and gift baskets.
speaker_heading: MARIAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Did daddy die?
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: What? Why?
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: MARIAH
dialog: There's never any food in this house!
text: A beat... then everyone in here either starts crying or
text: laughing. Andrea rises, crosses to her daughter.
text: Mariah collapses in her mother's arms. Both sobbing. CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. USS BAINBRIDGE - C.I.C. - SAME
text: Castellano puts down a phone, eyes Garridos and Aboitiz:
speaker_heading: CASTELLANO
dialog: The President has given the okay. If
dialog: we have a clean shot, we take it.
text: Aboitiz nods. Garridos grabs his radio:
speaker_heading: GARRIDOS (INTO RADIO)
dialog: Captain, you're in trouble. Let's
dialog: talk.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - RESUMING
text: Musi heard that. He eyes Phillips, unconscious on the floor.
text: We... END SEQUENCE. And DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LIFEBOAT - ON THE WATER - MORNING
text: Day breaks, hot and flat.
scene_heading: EXT. USS BAINBRIDGE - FANTAIL - SAME
text: We're looking through a SCOPE at the lifeboat. Sunlight
text: glints off one WINDOW. (The other was knocked out days ago.)
text: REVEAL Pettis, flat on his belly. In position, as always.
speaker_heading: PETTIS (INTO NECK-MIKE)
dialog: Boss, I have some minor glare, need a

speaker_heading: ABOITIZ (THRU EARPIECE)
dialog: Roger that. Two degrees.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - SAME
text: Musi has spent the night working on the lifeboat's ENGINE. He
text: goes to the Bridge. Hits the ignition. The engine starts.
text: The sound awakens Phillips - still atop the survival suit,
text: his head aching. He looks up at Musi.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: I'm going on the navy boat. To get
dialog: our money.
text: Not a small bit of news. Phillips studies him...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: It's a ship.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
text: The destroyer, it's a ship. A boat is
dialog: something like this, something you
dialog: can carry on a ship. Navy guys hate
dialog: it when you call their ship a boat.
dialog: Musi sighs: Do you ever stop fighting? Phillips shrugs.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: And we getting a tow. Bainbridge
dialog: gonna tow us.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Then why fix the engine?
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: They try any tricks, we cut the tow-
text: line and go into their hull.
text: Phillips notes the FUEL BUCKETS. They've all been UNCAPPED -
text: as if about to be turned into weapons. He considers that.
text: Just then, a SOUND outside: a ZODIAC, pulling up. Musi turns.
scene_heading: EXT. ZODIAC/EXT. LIFEBOAT - ON THE WATER - CONTINUING
text: Lt. Kinimura, bearing another BOX OF PROVISIONS.
text: .»+-and a TOW-LINE extending from the fantail of the

scene_heading: INT. PHILLIPS HOME - DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUING

speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: I could've done something. And I blew
dialog: it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Andrea, what're you talking about?
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: There's this homily Richard learned -
dialog: from a Priest in Africa. "God is
dialog: good, all the time. All the time, God
dialog: is good." We say it as a family now;
dialog: it's a tradition.
speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: It's lovely.
speaker_heading: ANDREA
dialog: Don't you understand? It's Easter
dialog: Sunday. Every Catholic in Vermont is
dialog: going to be in church today. I
dialog: could've asked our priest to spread
dialog: it around. I could've had it said in
dialog: every church up and down the state. I

speaker_heading: ALLISON
dialog: Let me work on this.
scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT —- CONTINUING

text: He's pointing to a CLIPBOARD, hanging on a nail on the
text: bulkhead, a pen dangling from it. Elmi doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like to write something - for my

speaker_heading: ELMI
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: In case.
speaker_heading: ELMI

scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH/INT. USS BAINBRIDGE - CIC - SAME

dialog: Phillips... almost broadcasting this to the Bainbridge:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: I want my wife to know that I'm sorry
dialog: for the call she's about to get - and
dialog: that I sailed all these years because
dialog: I'm a sailor, not because I liked
dialog: being away. And I'm sorry I was such
dialog: a pain in the ass to my kids about
dialog: school - I just, when it was my son's
dialog: turn, I didn't want him to have to
dialog: spend his life out here like I did,
dialog: leaving his family seven or eight
dialog: months a year just to make a living.
dialog: It costs too much. I made mistakes;
dialog: sometimes I treated my children like
dialog: they were crew-members.
dialog: (just realized)
dialog: .--and treated my crew-members like
dialog: they were children. I wish I could
dialog: undo all that.
speaker_heading: He HH HHH HH HK

text: On the Bainbridge, Garridos is listening. Castellano too.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Have to tell them that - have to make
dialog: sure they know. Or I won't be clean.
text: Elmi, nods, hands over the clipboard. Phillips grabs it, as:
text: Bang. Musi knocks it to the floor, noisily. Rage in his eyes.
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: We all have letters to write.
text: He turns, heads for the hatch. Phillips calls out to him:
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Did you say goodbye to your men?
text: That was an echo - and an accusation. Musi turns...
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS (CONT'D)
dialog: Captain's supposed to be the last one
dialog: off the ship - don't they teach you
dialog: that in the Somali Marines?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUSI
dialog: Keep talking, Irish.
text: And out he goes. Najee dogs the hatch shut.
speaker_heading: ELMI
dialog: Why you talk to him like that?
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: ‘Cause I'm never gonna see him again.
dialog: And neither are you.
dialog: The Pirates don't know how to take that...
scene_heading: EXT. ZODIAC - ON THE WATER - CONTINUING

speaker_heading: ABOITIZ (THRU EARPIECE)
dialog: All teams, be advised. Proceeding to

text: Beside one of the crates is a WINCH. The metal TOW-LINE
text: extends from here to the lifeboat. The winch comes to life,

text: Musi is helped up on to the fantail of the Bainbridge. He
text: eyes the Sniper-Killer Teams. And that WINCH, slowly pulling

dialog: 
text: Guilt hits Musi, hard. He's led inside by two SAILORS...

text: Elmi slaps Phillips. Two ropes fall to the floor.
speaker_heading: ELMI

speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: He cut a deal. He's not coming back.
speaker_heading: ELMI
dialog: You don't know.
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: I know when he found a pair of new
dialog: sandals he took them for himself and
dialog: left your friend here barefoot. I
dialog: know when he divvied up that thirty
dialog: thousand he took all the hundreds and
dialog: gave you guys all the fifties.
text: That landed on Bilal. Elmi turns on him instantly:
speaker_heading: ELMI
dialog: You don't listen to this!
speaker_heading: BILAL
dialog: I didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: ELMI
dialog: You want to be an American sailor?
dialog: You want to be lazy and drink beer?
dialog: Go ahead, go to movies with him. Be a

text: Elmi shouts at Bilal - in Somali now - Bilal shouting back,
text: both men rising -- a flashpoint, until:
speaker_heading: NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
dialog: Shut up!

speaker_heading: ELMI
dialog: Unclean place, Phillips. You going to
text: an unclean place.
speaker_heading: PHILLIPS
dialog: Fine. Long as I don't have to tie
dialog: anymore Goddamn knots.

speaker_heading: NAJEE (SOMALI, SUBTITLED)
dialog: Cut the tow-line.
scene_heading: EXT. USS BAINBRIDGE - FANTAIL - RESUMING

speaker_heading: PETTIS
dialog: Boss, we have movement on the deck of

dialog: 
text: Sure enough, Bilal emerges from the bow-hatch of the

dialog: 
scene_heading: PETTIS/JOON/RAMOS/ETC.
dialog: They've cut the tow. Repeat, lifeboat

scene_heading: INT. LIFEBOAT - SAME
text: Najee hits the IGNITION. The lifeboat engine rumbles awake.
text: Phillips whips around - his eyes on those FUEL BUCKETS in the

speaker_heading: CASTELLANO (THRU RADIO)
dialog: Lifeboat! What's going on in there?
dialog: We're hearing reports of gunfire and
